FT  21 JAN 94 / World Trade News: Cuts 'would have hit consumers'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
China would not have been the only casualty of US threats to cut its textile
quota by up to 30 per cent - US consumers would also have paid dearly,
according to a study by a leading Washington trade-policy institute, David
Dodwell, World Trade Editor, writes.
The quota cuts would have cost US consumers about Dollars 1.1bn a year,
according to Mr Gary Hufbauer at the Institute for International Economics,
who has just published a study of the cost of US protection.*
US textile producers would have captured gains of about Dollars 570m, but
the rest of China's 'loss' would have been snapped up by textile exporters
elsewhere in Asia and Latin America.
Quota cuts would have saved an estimated 8,000 jobs in the beleaguered US
textiles industry, but the cost per consumer of saving each job would have
amounted to about Dollars 136,000.

FT  21 JAN 94 / World Trade News: Showdown over silk brings latest victory
for Kantor - The US trade chief's Chinese textiles deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mrs Carla Hills, former US trade representative, defined failed trade talks
as those which result in sanctions. By this standard - and others - her
successor, Mr Mickey Kantor is a high achiever.
Mr Kantor has only once imposed sanctions - on the EU in a dispute over
government telecommunications procurement - and those were mostly symbolic.
(He and Sir Leon Brittan, his EU counterpart, may be nearing a solution on
telecommunications with the expected conclusion of a study this week forming
the basis of a deal.)
The trade representative has succeeded in numerous high-stakes showdowns
with the EU, Japan and China, employing neat timing and a potent combination
of seemingly reckless threats, followed by flexibility and ingenuity.
On Monday Mr Kantor announced still another triumph, a new three-year pact
with Beijing which sharply cuts the growth of Chinese textile and apparel
imports. By threatening a 25-35 per cent cut in China's current quotas and
refusing to cave in when China threatened retaliation and insisted on
last-minute changes in the pact, US negotiators got the customs co-operation
agreement they insist they need to curb 'massive' fraud and transshipment.
Customs will now be permitted to employ US-Chinese 'jump' teams, comprising
officials of both countries, to swoop on Chinese factories in search of
misleading labels and documentation, used to circumvent quotas.
US negotiators also got China to agree for the first time to ceilings on
silk apparel, which they say is sold so cheaply that it can undercut cotton.
Imports jumped from Dollars 900m in 1991 to Dollars 2.6bn in 1993; increases
will now be limited to 1 per cent a year for the next three years.
The US-Sino relationship has come some way since 1984, when a dispute over
textiles resulted in US sanctions and Chinese retaliation against American
grain.
That infuriated the US agricultural lobby, at a time of massive surpluses,
and so traumatised trade officials that they avoided confrontations with the
Chinese for years, even renewing the country's Most Favoured Nation status
after the crushing of the 1989 student uprising in Tiananmen Square.
Even now, China could easily shake up US industry by retaliating against the
vulnerable US aircraft makers, agriculture and capital goods producers. But
it now must reckon with pressure from its own business sector and its
interest in the lucrative US market, where its surplus last year soared
above Dollars 22m.
The textile deal both pleased and annoyed Mr Kantor's constituents. Although
overall quota growth is frozen this year and limited to 1 per cent in each
of the next two, importers were relieved to know their contracts would be
fulfilled. However, Ms Laura Jones, executive director of the Association of
Importers of Textiles and Apparel, was 'horrified' at the silk apparel
quotas, viewing them as a contradiction of the liberalisation promised in
the Uruguay Round.
US textile producers are pleased with a trade representative who brags that
US textiles are the 'best' in the world and US workers the most productive.
But they would have preferred the threatened 25-35 per cent quota cut to go
ahead, on the grounds that the Chinese deserve to be punished for
transshipment sins.
Mr Kantor said the 'resolute' US stand ought to send a message to Beijing
that the US would stand tough on other disputes, most importantly on renewal
of Most Favoured Nation status.
This is a message which has been conveyed by every US visiting official for
months, including Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US Treasury secretary, who appeared
there this week, and a delegation of US congressmen led by Mr Richard
Gephardt, the House majority leader, last weekend.
Beijing has also had encouraging hints that if it co-operates on human
rights, intellectual property rights and nuclear proliferation, it will be
invited to take a respected place among the community of trading nations.
'The Clinton administration does not want to make an annual MFN assessment
the central focal point for economic ties between the two countries year
after year,' said Mr Jeffrey Garten, the Commerce Department trade
undersecretary, on Wednesday in Frankfurt. 'We sincerely hope there can be
enough progress in the human rights area to get these MFN issues behind us.'
In the past, no amount of pressure has moved Beijing on human rights. If Mr
Kantor and the other players in this effort pull off this deal, it will be a
dazzling achievement indeed.

FT  21 JAN 94 / World Trade News: EdF in Slovak joint reactor venture
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Electricite de France (EdF) has signed a joint venture agreement with
Slovensky Energeticky Podnik (SEP), the Slovak electricity company, to
complete the construction of two nuclear reactors and manage SEP's
unfinished nuclear plant at Mochovce, about 120km east of Bratislava.
The total investment for completing the two Soviet-designed pressurised
water reactors and bringing safety up to western standards is expected to be
about DM1.3bn (Dollars 765m). The European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development is expected to provide financing for the project.
This is EdF's first contract to upgrade a Soviet-designed nuclear reactor.
Westinghouse Electric of the US won a contract last year to upgrade the
Temelin nuclear power plant in the Czech Republic.
Under the agreement, EdF will hold 51 per cent and SEP 49 per cent in EMO, a
joint venture company established for the project. Germany's Bayernwerk may
also take a stake in EMO, an EdF official said.
The Mochovce plant has been controversial and construction effectively
stopped in late 1989 after the 'velvet revolution' that brought an end to
the communist regime in what was then Czechoslovakia. Initially the plant
was to have four Soviet-designed VVER 440213 reactors with 440MW capacity
each. EDF says the reactors are the most recent Soviet design and
'relatively close' to western standards.

A deal which will lead to the re-opening of a pit closed last year by
British Coal is expected to be signed tomorrow, creating 200 jobs.
Clipstone colliery near Worksop in Nottinghamshire will become the first pit
hit with closure to start up again.
The colliery, which used to employ more than 1,000 miners, will be operated
under licence by RJB Mining, a Nottinghamshire-based company.
It is expected to re-open next week, although coal is unlikely to be cut for
several weeks.

Mitsui, a leading Japanese trading company, will invest Dollars 1m in the
international division of the Carlyle Group, a Washington investment group,
to take part in joint projects in Vietnam, China and the former Soviet
Union.
Mitsui, which will acquire 10 per cent of the international arm of the US
group, said its extensive network in China and South East Asia had attracted
Carlyle. The investment group holds equity holdings in companies covering
activities such as defence, telecommunications, property and services, and
sees new opportunities for investments in the Asian region and Russia.
Mitsui, which has 45 joint ventures in China, and has several offices in
Vietnam, in turn hopes Carlyle's extensive political links will create
business opportunities in the US.
The chairman of Carlyle, founded in 1987, is Mr Frank Carlucci, secretary of
defence in the Reagan administration; and Mr James Baker, former US
secretary of state, is a partner. The international division is led by Mr
Alton Keel, a former national security adviser to President Ronald Reagan.
Mitsui said it would not deal in defence or military-related equipment, but
intended to help defence-linked companies suffering from a fall in demand to
shift to civilian businesses.

FT  21 JAN 94 / Japanese coalition whips in MPs for reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's coalition government yesterday urged dissident members to close
ranks, to improve its finely balanced chances of winning a parliamentary
vote today on plans to overhaul the political and electoral system.
The vote, in the upper chamber, is the climax of a five-year national debate
on how to purge corruption from politics and create a more widely
representative parliament.
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa has staked his survival on the outcome,
which depends on an unpredictable handful of votes. His seven-party
coalition has a five-seat majority in the upper house, but 10 to 12
defections are expected from both sides of the chamber. Japan's previous two
prime ministers fell because of failure to achieve reform.
Both the coalition and the opposition Liberal Democratic party have found it
increasingly hard to enforce party discipline as the final vote has drawn
closer.
The splits are deep, because the proposed new electoral system threatens to
deprive many members of parliament of a seat after the next general
election.
A parliamentary showdown, a departure from the normal way of making
important decisions by consensus behind the scenes, became inevitable after
the failure of compromise talks on Wednesday night, between the coalition
and the LDP.
That was the trigger for the coalition to return to the offensive yesterday
morning, by forcing a vote on the four reform bills in the upper house's
political reform committee, the final step before going to the full house
for approval.
It won the committee vote narrowly, by 18 votes to 16, helped by the
defection of LDP member Mr Tomoichi Hoshino, to the government's side.
Mr Hoshino's decision to join the growing queue of LDP defections - there
were five two weeks ago - took his party officials by surprise and fuelled
their fears that other MPs might be preparing to follow his example.
Leaders of the Social Democratic party, the coalition's shakiest member,
were yesterday meeting potential defectors, who fear the party will fare
badly under the planned electoral system, a mixture of single-seat
constituencies and proportional representation. 'We must not be blamed for
killing the political reforms,' they were told by Mr Tomiichi Murayama, the
party's chairman.

FT  21 JAN 94 / US fingers crossed over N Korea: Why Washington is being so
patient with Pyongyang
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The leader pages of US newspapers have been filled with columns in recent
weeks criticising the Clinton administration for appeasing North Korea and
urging it to take tougher measures to force Pyongyang to comply with the
nuclear non-proliferation treaty.
'If that's what these pundits want, they should sit on their pencils and
lead the charge across the (Korean) DMZ,' said one irritated US State
Department official.
The worry among US diplomats is that tough actions, ranging from economic
sanctions to pre-emptive military strikes against North Korea's nuclear
facilities, could precipitate one of the most destructive wars since 1945.
It is the main reason why the US has been patiently pursuing negotiations
with North Korea to persuade it to accept full international inspections of
its nuclear sites.
The dilemma is what happens if those negotiations fail. Will the US risk a
conflict on the Korean peninsula or instead decide to live with a possibly
nuclear North Korea as it has done with other suspected nuclear powers such
as Pakistan?
There is some optimism that decision will never have to be made. North Korea
has been discussing details of the resumption of regular inspections of
seven nuclear sites meeting with the International Atomic Energy Agency
(IAEA) for the past two weeks in Vienna. The Vienna talks followed an
announcement by the US on January 5 that North Korea had agreed in principle
to allow the inspections, which have been suspended for almost a year.
The pace of negotiations has been slower than expected, although the US
State Department expressed confidence last week that there is 'no reason to
believe that there's been any erosion in the North Korean commitments' to
resume inspections.
But US intelligence agencies recently estimated that there is a 'better than
even chance' that North Korea has already constructed one or two crude
nuclear devices using plutonium extracted in 1989 from a small 5-megawatt
nuclear reactor at the Yongbyon nuclear centre.
The fear is that North Korea's acquisition of nuclear weapons could provoke
a nuclear arms race in north-east Asia by forcing Japan and South Korea to
follow suit. Pyongyang might also emerge as a supplier of nuclear technology
to other anti-western nations, such as Iran.
But disagreements exist among policymakers in Washington and Seoul about
whether the North's suspected nuclear weapons programme is real or a bluff
and why it is blocking inspections.
The US State Department, for example, disputed the intelligence assessment
of the North's nuclear capability. Some US officials privately complain the
Defence Department and Central Intelligence Agency have exaggerated the
North Korean threat as part of an effort to curtail cuts in their budgets.
'It's how the game is played in Washington,' said one official.
There are contrasting explanations for North Korea's behaviour. The most
obvious is that the North wants to prevent the IAEA from discovering its
nuclear weapons programme because it is intent on possessing nuclear
weapons.
The alternative view is that the North is using the nuclear inspection issue
as a bargaining chip to win diplomatic recognition and economic aid from the
US and bolster its crumbling economy.
A possible contributory factor is that the US angered the North when it
resumed the annual Team Spirit military exercises in South Korea last year.
The North agreed to start accepting IAEA inspections in 1992 in return for
the suspension of that year's Team Spirit exercises. Pyongyang apparently
saw Team Spirit's resumption in 1993 as the US breaking its word and it
responded by discontinuing the IAEA inspections.
An interim settlement could include the US suspending Team Spirit this year
if the North permits inspections and agrees to negotiate with South Korea on
mutual nuclear inspections as promised in their 1991 non-nuclear pact.
This would lay the foundation for a comprehensive agreement in which the US
could offer diplomatic recognition and economic support in return for North
Korea accepting complete inspections by the IAEA and South Korea.
But the negotiations to reach a package deal could be a long and tortuous
process. The Clinton administration is being criticised for possibly giving
North Korea breathing space to finish its nuclear weapons programme as it
engages in protracted talks.
Negotiations, however, still appear to be the best option in solving the
dispute. A pre-emptive attack on the North's nuclear facilities would almost
certainly cause the North to attack the South.
UN economic sanctions, if they are not vetoed by China, might also provoke
an attack. North Korea would have to draw on its fuel and food reserves for
the military to survive sanctions, which would severely weakened its
defence. Pyongyang may then see little alternative but to go on the
offensive. It is one reason why Japan and South Korea are cautious about
proceeding with sanctions.
The options appear tough for a US administration that wants to avoid a war
on the Korean peninsula. There is little question that tens and possibly
hundreds of thousands would be killed in a conflict that would mainly take
place in the heavily-populated environs around Seoul, the world's fifth
largest city, which lies just 35 miles from the DMZ.
The Clinton administration has made the North Korean nuclear inspection a
test case for stopping nuclear proliferation, but the question remains at
what cost. US General Omar Bradley said of the last Korean conflict of
1950-53 that it was 'the wrong war, at the wrong place, at the wrong time,
and with the wrong enemy'. The US will have to determine whether that
judgment still holds true.

FT  21 JAN 94 / Old north-south division threatens Yemen's three-year unity
</HEADLINE>

   ADEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The threat of civil war lingers in Yemen, despite apparently successful
efforts this week to negotiate a settlement to the country's political
crisis, now entering its sixth month.
Military units of the former north and south Yemen maintained a watchful
stance yesterday along the border which, before unification three years ago,
had divided them.
President Ali Abdullah Saleh and Vice President Ali Salem al-Biedh have
agreed to meet to sign an agreement which is aimed at ending a crisis that
began in late August. It was then that Mr Biedh, frustrated by the lack of
co-operation from the president, left the capital Sanaa and returned to
Aden, his political base in the former South Yemen.
Mr Biedh had long complained about the lack of security in the country, the
continued presence of military forces in cities, and the alleged
mismanagement of the economy.
In September, Mr Biedh, who heads the Yemen Socialist party, issued an
18-point programme for national reform and called for its implementation as
a condition of his return to Samaa. Although General Saleh has since
accepted the YSP programme, he has so far failed to implement it and Mr
Biedh has remained in Aden.
Faced with the impasse, leading politicians in late November formed a
committee to resolve the dispute and this week finalised a document which,
they believe, could end the problem. Incorporating all 18 points of the
Socialist programme, the document has raised hopes of a solution to the
crisis.
Western diplomatic sources said yesterday that General Saleh was 'confident'
that the agreement would bring a quick end to the impasse. And optimism
appeared to be underscored yesterday as the Yemeni riyal strengthened by
nearly 20 per cent in unofficial trading.
But, according to Mr Biedh, implementation of the document is the crucial
point in ending the crisis and he has little hope of that. 'We will arrive
at results which are theoretical, but our real problem will be
implementation,' he said, but added: 'We have no faith that there will be
implementation.'
Mr Biedh explained earlier this week that he and General Saleh had reached
many agreements before but 'unfortunately, none have been implemented'.
Gen Saleh has meanwhile admitted that reports of a southern aircraft bombing
northern troops on Monday were false. He claimed instead that a jet had
flown at low altitude over the Al-Malika encampment of northern soldiers in
the town of Laudar, about 170 kilometres north east of Aden, and that the
resulting sonic boom had been misinterpreted as an explosion.
Journalists visiting the site on Wednesday confirmed that no bombing had
occurred, but that last Friday some 300 northern troops had left their base
in Laudar and had commandeered a strategically placed private house to
control access to and from the town.

FT  21 JAN 94 / Airlines to stop sales in naira
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   LAGOS, LUANDA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
International airlines in Nigeria are to stop ticket sales in local currency
from February 1 to prevent a backlog of naira earnings until the government
clarifies its new foreign exchange regulations.
The decision follows warnings by businessmen that exchange rate and interest
rate controls introduced in last week's budget are unworkable, and will
severely erode legitimate foreign trade.
Mr Ebenezer Babatope, transport minister, has threatened to penalise the
Board of Airline Representatives for action he called 'embarrassing but also
illegal and out of tune with the aspirations of this year's budget'.
If he overrules the ban on naira sales, airlines could restrict ticket sales
to outside Nigeria. The airlines told the government last July they were
worried about a remittance backlog worth the naira equivalent of Dollars 50m
(Pounds 33.3m) by the start of January.
The airlines believe the 1994 budget could worsen their position as it makes
no provision for invisible earnings. It allots 80 per cent of foreign
exchange to manufacturing and agriculture. Nigeria's deepening economic
crisis has led to fears of rapid naira depreciation. 'Our decision is just
to limit the damage,' an airline official said in Lagos yesterday.
'The airlines in Nigeria need an average of Dollars 30m a month to remit
their local currency ticket sales to Europe. According to the budget, we
won't get anything like that amount and we will be left with an even bigger
naira balance.'
The government fixes Nigeria-Europe fares at less than the sale price in
Europe. Airlines must also base the naira price on an official dollar rate
of N22. Last year the market rate was around N45.
Angola said yesterday it had abolished differential exchange rates for
foreign currency and introduced a single floating exchange regime, Reuter
writes from Luanda.

Britain a few months more to agree with China the overall funding of Asia's
largest integrated transport plan.
The Hong Kong government is asking the finance committee of LegCo to approve
an extra HKDollars 1.7bn of government spending on the airport. Of this,
HKDollars 377m is for the running costs of the Provisional Airport Authority
(PAA) until March 1995; HKDollars 1.3bn is for design work and construction
of foundations for the airport terminal.
If LegCo approves this finance, and it seems it will, the Hong Kong
government will have until the summer to agree with China the overall
financing for the project, an agreement which would keep alive the hope of
finishing the project before the end of British rule in mid-1997. The
balance of risk remains on the side of no agreement and that the government
will have to admit publicly what most businessmen and government officials
are saying in private: that the airport will not become fully operational
much before 2000.
Companies planning to tender for vital airport services, such as baggage and
cargo handling, believe the new airport at Chek Lap Kok will not be fully
operational until mid-1998. This prediction assumes the PAA is able to award
the franchises for the various services by July this year, and importantly,
that China gives its blessing to the franchisees.
Potential holders of a franchise are in little doubt as to the importance of
China's approval. One senior businessman whose company will be tendering
from a franchise said: 'If the PAA awards the franchises without Beijing's
approval, all China has to do is say they do not think it a good idea, and
the banks will not lend the money. China calls all the shots.'
Many in Hong Kong believe the political row between China and Britain over
democracy in Hong Kong has made it virtually impossible for China to agree
to the Hong Kong government's suggestions on how to finance the project.
Some believe China has decided it does not want the British to 'complete'
the airport and would rather it be finished a year or so into Chinese
sovereignty.
Mr Victor Sit, a university professor and adviser to Beijing on the airport,
believes officials in China run a personal political risk if they accede to
the Hong Kong government's suggestions for financing the airport at this
time, when relations are so fraught. 'There is a very serious problem of
mistrust, so if they (Beijing officials) let go of the airport issue, there
would be more political troubles ..for themselves,' he said recently.
British officials hope Mr Sit is wrong. They speculate that between now and
when Governor Chris Patten introduces his second political reform bill
(probably in early March) there exists a chance for a deal.
To test this, Britain requested a meeting of the Anglo-Chinese 'airport
committee' earlier this week and indicated it was prepared to make yet
another offer on the financing of the airport.
Since March 1992, it has made three separate proposals. But the fourth and
latest offer may meet China's stated concerns about the level of debt the
airport and railway will carry, come July 1997, when responsibility for Hong
Kong passes from Britain to China.
The Hong Kong government sought to meet Beijing's complaint about debt in
its second financial proposal, made public in September 1992. Debt financing
for the airport was cut to Dollars HK5.9bn from HKDollars 37bn, while the
debt needed to be raised to build the airport railway was cut to HKDollars
17bn from HKDollars 36bn.
The 'problem' with this proposal was that about half the Dollars HK50bn
increase in equity it envisaged would come from a land fund established for
the use of the post-colonial government. China, which wanted more equity,
was not prepared to spend its 'own' money to see that end achieved.
Beijing, on safer ground, also pointed out that the British had agreed in
1991 that total government debt outstanding at June 1997 should not exceed
HKDollars 5bn. The Hong Kong government was still in breach of that
agreement as the project's total debt was HKDollars 23bn. Details of the
latest financial proposal are not public but it is understood the government
is prepared to throw yet more equity at the airport and its connecting
railway, meaning a commensurately lower level of debt.
There is much resistance within the government to putting more money into
the airport, but Hong Kong can afford it. Its coffers are brimming with
cash, mainly due to receipts from stamp duty on stock market transactions; a
projected deficit of HKDollars 3.5bn in 1993-94 is now expected to be a
large surplus.
China has yet to respond to the request for another meeting of the airport
committee or to the latest financial proposal. Mr Zhang Junsheng, a Chinese
official in Hong Kong, lowered official hopes of a positive response when he
indicated a meeting of the committee was not in the offing.

FT  21 JAN 94 / Patten opposes referendum on reform plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL, Asia Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor, yesterday voiced opposition to a
referendum on political development, saying it would serve little purpose
and would be bitterly opposed by Beijing.
Mr Patten offered a spirited defence of his attempts to broaden the
democratic franchise as he faced more than two hours of questioning from a
House of Commons foreign affairs select committee.
He appealed to Beijing to resume negotiations, which broke down in November
on his proposals on arrangements for elections to be held this year and in
1995.
Mr Patten said that, with opinion polls consistently backing his plans, a
referendum would reveal little new. It was in any case up to the Legislative
Council to decide on electoral procedure. He also noted that China was
'completely neuralgic' on the question. 'I'm not in the business of trying
to tweak the Chinese tail.'
Mr Patten said a referendum would also unnecessarily polarise opinion in
Hong Kong. 'I've got enough experience never to say never but I'm not
disposed to believe that it would be the right way forward for Hong Kong.'
Questions from members of the UK parliament revealed a difference in
priorities from their last report in 1989, which recommended direct
elections to LegCo be drastically speeded up. Instead, they exhibited
concern that Mr Patten's more modest attempts to widen the franchise only of
indirectly elected seats had been too confrontational and made without
sufficient consultation with Beijing.
Some questions reflected criticisms of Mr Patten which the committee
recently heard from Sir Percy Cradock, a retired senior diplomat, who
described the governor's approach as reckless and counter-productive.
Mr Patten rejected Sir Percy's allegation that he had refused Beijing's
request for consultations on his proposals. He said Sir Percy, arguing for
settlement with Beijing on the best terms available, failed to specify
exactly what he would be prepared to settle for.

<TEXT>
South Africa's black township dwellers are to resume paying rent and taxes
to local governments, ending a decade-long boycott which played a part in
forcing the ruling National party to end apartheid.
Representatives of black community organisations yesterday signed an accord
calling on residents to restart payments, in exchange for a government
commitment to resume and improve the quality of services in black townships,
where electricity, water, sewage and refuse collection are provided
intermittently or not at all.
African National Congress President Nelson Mandela told a conference of
local authorities yesterday the ANC would launch a campaign to end the
boycott, which could prove an embarrassment to a new ANC government.
Residents who have paid no charges for years will not resume immediately,
despite Mr Mandela's urging; many will resist paying until services improve
substantially.
The agreement is part of a radical reorganisation of local government to end
racial segregation. Within 90 days, most black and white local councils will
merge, and share one tax base, ahead of local government elections later
this year or next.

FT  21 JAN 94 / Clinton gives more help to quake victims
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton yesterday gave California a Dollars 100m (Pounds
67.5m) advance for earthquake repairs and announced an extension of 100 per
cent federal financing for emergency work in the stricken state, Reuter
reports.
The actions were in addition to the Dollars 140m aid he released on
Wednesday for victims of Monday's Los Angeles earthquake.
Victims swamped disaster centres with pleas for emergency aid, as
authorities worked to find shelter for thousands driven from their homes.
With rainstorms on the way and the ground still heaving with aftershocks,
officials said they were doing all they could to avoid more loss of life in
the aftermath of the quake.
The sheriff's department said the death toll had risen to 51, with 4,800
injured and up to Dollars 30bn (Pounds 20.2bn) in damage.
More than 20,000 of the region's 'new homeless' - about half of them
children - shivered through another cold, damp night in makeshift tent
cities in parks and vacant lots.
Already worried about deteriorating health conditions, authorities said
their top priority was to find them housing before the arrival of rain,
forecast for tomorrow night.
Storms could also wreak more havoc with the region's crumbled freeway system
and with some of the 4,000 homes and businesses damaged or destroyed in the
costliest quake in US history, measuring 6.6 on the Richter scale.
Cars lined up for miles in traffic jams. Tens of thousands of people were
still without power or water. With most big supermarkets boarded up,
residents scavenged for food.
Governor Pete Wilson wrote to Mr Clinton that losses could range from
Dollars 15bn to Dollars 30bn.
Louise Kehoe adds: In the wake of the aftershocks, building inspectors will
have to re-examine many of the damaged homes and commercial structures that
they had previously deemed inhabitable. Schools, most of which remain closed
, must similarly be re-inspected.
Of 600 schools, over 100 have sustained significant damage, with 24 severely
battered with collapsed walls and ceilings.

FT  21 JAN 94 / Washington shut as 96 die in cold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US government and private businesses shut down in Washington yesterday
after Mrs Sharon Pratt Kelly, the city's mayor, declared an emergency in the
face of record cold weather.
States from Kentucky to Pennsylvania also declared emergencies as frostbite
and icy roads claimed at least 96 lives - far more than died in this week's
California earthquake.
Electricity and gas companies, unable to cope with the demand for power,
were forced to impose rotating blackouts on their customers on Wednesday and
begged customers to turn down their thermostats. In the end, they asked
local governments to shut businesses down in order to reduce the double
drain of home and office heating.
While utility companies can usually buy in power from their neighbours to
cope with unusual demands, sub-zero temperatures covered such a wide area of
the country - from Alabama to Maine - that few generators had much spare
power to sell.
Washington, poised between north and south and afflicted with the weather
extremes of both, always seems to suffer more than other places when snow or
ice hits.
New Yorkers trudged stoically to work yesterday with few noticeable
disruptions, while North Dakotans continued to jog despite temperatures as
low as - 32 degrees Celsius.
But in Washington yesterday, everything closed as the city declared its
first ever emergency in a bid to cut down on fuel consumption.
Non-essential businesses faced fines of up to Dollars 1,000 (Pounds 675) if
they opened, but few workers seemed to be running that risk as snow coated
the ice that city emergency workers had been unable to control with salt and
sand.
Those bold enough to drive faced a half-hour struggle to get cars warmed up
and dug out. Those who favoured public transport had to gamble with
unpredictable bus timetables and routes.
The good news yesterday was that weather forecasters expected warmer weather
 -but the east coast could wait days or weeks before temperatures rise above
freezing.

   NEW YORK, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US housing starts rose by an unexpectedly strong 6.2 per cent in December to
an annual rate of 1.54m, the Commerce Department said yesterday, agencies
report from New York and Washington. Wall Street economists had expected
December housing starts at a 1.43m annual rate.
The housing figure, up from 4.3 per cent in November, was coupled with an
even more impressive 7.4 per cent increase in building permits last month.
Meanwhile, Mr Roger Altman, deputy treasury secretary, said yesterday that
fourth quarter growth rate 'could have been' as strong as 6 per cent in real
terms.
'It's clear that (the fourth quarter) was a strong quarter - a very strong
quarter - and we hope that despite this weather the first quarter will
maintain that momentum. . . I'm not suggesting that the first quarter will
be in the 6 per cent area. I doubt that very strongly. But it should be a
good quarter.'
The department said December housing starts, which were up for the fifth
month in a row, were at the highest level since January 1990, when they
stood at 1.55m. Starts for all last year climbed to an unadjusted 1.29m, the
highest annual total since 1.38m in 1989.
Economists said the permits increase, to an annual level of 1.475m,
suggested more housebuilding strength in the next few months, though
building was likely to drop off this month because of the severe cold
weather in the east and the Los Angeles earthquake.
Vice President Al Gore said recently that gross domestic product could
expand at an annual rate of as much as 6 per cent, after eliminating the
effects of inflation, in the fourth quarter.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Banco Latino, the big Venezuelan commercial bank that closed its doors a
week ago, will re-open on January 28 to start repaying depositors, but
initially only up to Dollars 930 (Pounds 628) each, government officials
said.
The re-opening is the first phase of a government plan to return deposits to
small account holders, and to try putting the institution back on its feet.
By refunding deposits of up to Dollars 930 the government believes it will
cover demands from over 631,000 individual account holders, or about 60 per
cent of depositors.
The government will later repay larger sums to depositors, but the maximum
guarantee for each account - 1m Venezuelan bolivars or about Dollars 9,300 -
will not be paid out unless the bank is liquidated.
Caracas has been rife with rumours about the health of other financial
institutions. Mr Roger Urbina, the superintendent of banks who has taken
temporary control of Banco Latino, warned that if the rumours continue,
other Venezuelan banks could be endangered.

   LOS ANGELES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Strong aftershocks have compounded the problems of earthquake-weary
residents of Los Angeles and complicated the tasks of those struggling to
restore basic services to the city.
Two jolts, each measuring 5.1 on the Richter scale, occurred just two
minutes apart on Wednesday afternoon, causing further structural damage to
many buildings already weakened by Monday's pre-dawn 6.6 quake.
Building inspectors, who fanned out across the city on Wednesday morning,
will have to re-examine many of the damaged homes and commercial structures
that they had previously deemed inhabitable. Schools, most of which remain
closed , must similarly be re-inspected for damage.
Of approximately 600 schools, over 100 have sustained significant damage,
with 24 that are severely battered with collapsed walls and ceilings. There
is no word yet on when many of the city's 640,000 students may be able to
return to school. Preliminary damage estimates run to Dollars 700m.
The aftershocks also increased the fears of those who have abandoned their
homes. Despite the efforts of city officials to persuade them to find
shelter, about 18,000 people spent a third night in parks and open spaces.
For commuters, the aftershocks caused more misery. Residents of the Santa
Clarita Valley, to the north of Los Angeles, now virtually isolated by
freeway closures, have been encouraged to abandon their cars in favour of
the Metro-Link suburban train service. That too, however, was temporarily
closed on Wednesday afternoon when aftershocks caused a rockslide.
Traffic congestion remains the most widespread impact of the earthquake with
millions of people struggling to find alternative routes to and from work as
businesses reopen.
In the hard-hit San Fernando Valley, some 40,000 homes are expected to be
without running water for several more days.

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US attorney general, Ms Janet Reno, yesterday named a Republican lawyer
to head an investigation into President Bill Clinton's financial dealings in
Arkansas.
Mr Robert Fiske, a senior partner in the New York firm of Davis Polk &amp;
Wardwell, will examine Mr Clinton's investment in an Arkansas property
venture called Whitewater Development, and his links to Madison Guaranty, a
failed savings and loan institution.
While no direct allegations of wrongdoing have been made against Mr or Mrs
Clinton, they have been unable to dispel the perception of unanswered
questions. Mr Clinton last week bowed to a chorus of Republican complaints
and asked for the appointment of a special counsel.
Among the areas Mr Fiske will examine is the possible diversion of
depositors' funds from Madison to Whitewater, or to Mr Clinton's campaign
fund for his 1984 election as governor of Arkansas.
Mr Fiske said yesterday that he would also examine any links between
Whitewater and the perplexing suicide last year of Mr Vincent Foster, a
senior White House lawyer and old friend of the Clintons who was handling
the affair for them.
Mr Fiske was appointed chief federal prosecutor for Manhattan by Republican
President Gerald Ford in 1976, but continued to serve under Democratic
President Jimmy Carter.
He was asked to be deputy attorney general by President George Bush, but
withdrew after he was attacked by right-wingers in the Senate who claimed
that as chairman of an American Bar Association committee screening
potential judicial nominees he had helped to undermine some of President
Ronald Reagan's more conservative choices for the federal bench.
Whitewater appears to arouse much less interest in the US at large than it
does in Washington, but in a New York Times poll published yesterday 59 per
cent of those questioned said they thought Mr Clinton was hiding something,
even if he was mostly telling the truth. More than two thirds said they did
not know enough to say whether he or Mrs Clinton did something wrong.

FT  21 JAN 94 / Bundesbank announces a more refined system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Bundesbank yesterday reduced and restructured its minimum reserve
requirements in a move it claimed would cut costs and improve
competitiveness in the German banking system.
It would also allow private sector banks' room to adjust their interest
rates, the central bank said in a statement after a routine meeting of its
policy-making council. From March 1, requirements for sight deposits held by
domestic and foreign investors will be fixed at 5 per cent. At present
German deposits are subject to a scale of requirements ranging from 6.6 per
cent to 12.1 per cent.
The Bundesbank calculated that the changes would lead to a total reduction
of DM29bn (Pounds 11.3bn) in requirements set against their deposits,
including DM18bn currently held interest-free at the central bank. 'This
will allow us to use these funds more effectively,' said a spokesman for
Commerzbank. 'It will also level the playing field and allow us to compete
better with French and British banks.'
But banking analysts were uncertain whether it would lead to more generous
borrowing conditions for the private sector. 'Some benefits may be passed on
to better quality clients,' one said.
German banks have been widely criticised for their apparent reluctance to
pass on to customers the full benefits of the Bundesbank's series of rate
cuts over the past 18 months.
The Bundesbank has traditionally used minimum reserve requirements as a
means of controlling money supply growth, which is the central factor in its
interest rates policy.
The changes would not affect the long-term effectiveness of minimum
reserves, which it described as an 'important instrument', the bank said in
a statement. It would compensate for the increase in liquidity caused by the
reduced requirements by reducing the volume of funds injected regularly
through its securities repurchase agreements.
Yesterday's meeting, which left key interest rates unchanged, agreed that
repurchase agreements for the next two weeks would continue at a fixed rate
of 6 per cent. The repo rate has been unchanged since December 8, while the
short-term discount and Lombard rates were last reduced on October 22 last
year.

Apres moi le deluge was the message from Mr Boris Fyodorov, Russia's
35-year-old finance minister, whose resignation last night leaves a gaping
hole in the country's economic reform programme.
A pugnacious champion of market reform, he said he was quitting not just
because his conditions for staying had been rejected, but because the
government was planning to abandon his tough financial policy. 'There is a
fine line between a moderate policy and an inflationary policy,' he said,
expressing hopes that 'the few remaining professionals in the government'
would try to prevent the 'catastrophe' of hyperinflation.
Announcing his resignation, Mr Fyodorov predicted that attempts to fight
inflation by means other than tough monetary and fiscal policies would lead
to a surge in inflation in the second quarter, from its present level of
around 20 per cent a month.
'Nothing' would stop the fall in the rouble, which has lost a third of its
value against the dollar in the past three weeks, unless, he added
sarcastically, Mr Victor Gerashchenko, the central bank chairman whose
removal he had demanded, kept 'his promise of a return to a fixed exchange
rate'. Moves towards a domestically convertible currency have been one of
the main components of reform in the past two years.
Mr Fyodorov doubted Russia could count on significant help from
international organisations such as the International Monetary Fund to
support a changed course. Hours earlier, Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, who angrily
rejected Mr Fyodorov's attempts to dictate conditions for staying in his
government, sought to pre-empt such remarks by vowing he was not retreating
from market reforms but correcting them.
'The age of market romanticism is over,' Mr Chernomyrdin declared. He denied
he was planning to spend his way out of crisis, saying it is 'not true that
Chernomyrdin will give money here and there'. The government had to embrace
other tried and tested methods for fighting inflation, including promoting
competition, pursuing an industrial policy and, he hinted, wage limits to be
agreed between government, unions and workers.
'Fyodorov's departure shows the government is determined to change tack and
see if there are other ways to control inflation,' said one western
economist. 'I would expect what they are saying: more support for industry
and agriculture, and less reliance on markets to determine economic
restructuring. It is a change of direction rather than going from one
extreme to another.'
The problem is that many of these policies, including an anti-monopoly
policy and an industrial policy of selective support for industry, have been
proclaimed by the government for a year or more. Nor are they inconsistent
with what Mr Fyodorov was trying to achieve in his role as finance minister.
They have not worked because they have been badly handled, insufficiently
developed or too awkward politically. Russia's economic reform has never
been comprehensive or synchronised. It has suffered from frequent personnel
changes and a dearth of talented people, in an area where pushing through
consistent policies places heavy demands on individual politicians and
economists.
Over the past year, Mr Fyodorov has struggled to curb Russia's high
inflation, and has, at the least, fended off a real threat of
hyperinflation. In the process, he was accused of starving various
ministries of funds to spend on industry, defence, and other state sectors.
But he had little choice in a government accustomed to taking spending
decisions it could not afford.
Mr Fyodorov's departure does not mean the death of economic reform; that is
a process difficult to stop. But it heralds a slowing of pace, and the loss
of a highly effective professional to a government where no ministers,
except Mr Anatoly Chubais, the deputy prime minister responsible for
privatisation, can point to concrete achievements. 'One wonders whether
they'll be any more successful in picking industrial winners than losers,
especially given a populist parliament,' one economist said.
Mr Fyodorov's departure will be a blow to the confidence of western
financial institutions, creditor banks, and large sections of Russia's
business community. He was the man people loved to hate, but many of his
supposed enemies will be sorry to see him go, for, at the least, he pursued
a clear policy rather than no policy at all. 'He was right not to give money
to everybody who wanted it,' said one executive at Avtovaz, Russia's biggest
car producer. 'Why should he give more money to agriculture when we cannot
even reap what we sow?'

FT  21 JAN 94 / Red tape tangles up UN troops in Bosnia: Commanders believe
the organisation is in danger of losing its credibility there
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UN troops in Bosnia have been so hamstrung by bureaucracy that their control
room has been forced to hold whip-arounds to raise money for essential
equipment.
The military commander says that on one occasion he learned of his movements
not from his superiors, but from CNN TV. Troops of more than eight
nationalities are communicating in second languages within an inadequate
military command structure.
If Mr Douglas Hurd, British foreign secretary, needs any further convincing
about the deep frustrations felt by the UN troops on the ground in Bosnia,
he could do worse than take note of this description of UN operations given
recently by Brig Vere Hayes, former UN chief of staff in Bosnia.
In the sixth months Brig Hayes served in Bosnia, between spring and autumn
last year, he experienced a catalogue of difficulties that have now led many
military commanders in Bosnia to believe the UN is in danger of completely
losing its credibility there.
Brig Hayes claimed the frustrations stemmed from the inadequacy of the UN
command, which, he said, did not have a proper military control centre when
the peacekeeping operation was first established.
This has been partly rectified, but the command structure is still
essentially devoted to peacekeeping rather than peace-creating operations.
The result has been a structure ill-equipped to respond with speed. When
Brig Hayes was embroiled in the delicate task of monitoring Serb positions
on Mt Igman around Sarajevo last year, he was, at one point, told of his
next movements by his press officer who had been watching CNN.
With no independent UN intelligence-gathering structure in place, UN
commanders depend on national battalions sharing intelligence to plan their
operations - intelligence that the separate national commanders have often
been unwilling to share.
National commanders have also been increasingly reluctant to obey UN
commands without complete authorisation from their governments; one reason
for the delay in reaching Mostar this summer was that the Spanish commanders
insisted on consulting with their national governments first.
The essential factor behind these problems is the lack of any clear
political mandate. Amid the flurry of UN resolutions, with over 60 relating
to Bosnia in the past 18 months, most commanders are now convinced the
political will does not exist among the allies for them to carry out the
task demanded.
Lt-Gen Francis Briquemont, Belgian commander of UN forces in Bosnia,
commented recently he did not bother to read the UN mandates any more
because he did not have the troops to carry them out.
The result has been that the troops have faced almost daily humiliation at
the hands of the combatants, amid a steadily-mounting death toll and growing
doubts about their effectiveness.
A report by the UN High Commission for Refugees has estimated only 20 per
cent of last month's aid to central Bosnia was delivered; UK officials
believe up to one-third across Bosnia falls into the hands of soldiers.

FT  21 JAN 94 / Friction with UN fails to deter French: Despite the 'waltz
of the generals' Paris is determined to keep troops in Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
France still considers that pulling its blue helmet troops out of Bosnia
would be 'catastrophic' because the war might spread, but it regards the
prospect of retreat as no longer unthinkable, a senior official said
yesterday.
The deepening gloom in Paris, which led Mr Alain Juppe, the foreign
minister, yesterday to call urgent consultations between the European Union,
the US and Russia, is the result of the failure of the Geneva negotiations
to produce any diplomatic breakthrough, of intensification of the war with
the beleaguered Moslems now fighting back and causing French casualties in
the process, and of command difficulties with the United Nations.
President Francois Mitterrand is shortly expected to propose to Mr Boutros
Boutros-Ghali, UN secretary general, that General Bertrand de Lapresle,
commander of France's rapid reaction force, should succeed General Jean Cot
as the head of the United Nations Protection Force in the former Yugoslavia.
Gen Cot ran foul of Mr Boutros-Ghali for publicly criticising the UN chief
for hamstringing his operation, and his departure by March 31 is being
reluctantly accepted by Paris.
Apart from General Cot's somewhat choleric reputation even inside the French
military - which contrasted with the more imperturbable temperament of his
predecessor, General Philippe Morillon - French officials see more general
reasons for the chronic friction between commanders on the spot and UN
headquarters in New York. The military commanders 'not only have no real
political power behind them, but also do not have the proper means to carry
out a mission which the politicians keep increasing'.
Last summer, the UN gave them the task of creating 'safe havens' for Moslem
refugees, last autumn the European Union came up with the idea of creating a
'humanitarian corridor' into Bosnia from the sea.
France's chief military frustration with the UN has been over the procedure
for authorising possible air strikes to enforce UN resolutions. At the
outset it was agreed that initial authorisation had to come from the UN
secretary general, while authority for subsequent air strikes could come
from the Unprofor commander.
But the air threat has been regarded as bluff by the warring parties, who
know well Mr Boutros-Ghali's reluctance to order bombing raids. In two
separate ways, French commanders have tried - and failed - to make the
threat more credible.
General Cot asked the UN to delegate to him the power to generally initiate
air strikes on forces directly attacking the UN military troops, buildings
or convoys. Mr Boutros-Ghali refused, but the French government did not make
a fuss, choosing to treat it as an issue between the UN chief and his local
commander.
After this month's Nato summit threat to use possible air power to force the
opening of the Tuzla airfield in northern Bosnia, France made a proposal
which it thought would salve the UN secretary general's worry about giving
carte blanche to a general. It suggested that, in the precise case of Tuzla,
Mr Boutros-Ghali should delegate to his Japanese deputy in Bosnia, Mr
Yasushi Akashi, the right to order an air strike. Again, Mr Boutros-Ghali
refused. His failure to trust even his own deputy has angered Paris.
The growing French view is that the UN in New York is not up to its job.
'Not only do they have too many UN troops to worry about - 24,000 around the
world - but they have a culture which is capable of managing static
situations like Cyprus, but not fast-moving conflicts like Bosnia or
Somalia,' an official said yesterday.
Friction with the UN is, however, something which France appears willing to
live with, even if it causes what is being dubbed in Paris 'the waltz of the
generals' in and out of Bosnia. In the end, it will be the warring parties'
behaviour in Geneva and on the battlefield that will determine whether the
French stay. Among their partners in ex-Yugoslavia, Paris is aware of the
growing inclination of Britain and Spain to pull their men out. 'Any
departure will have to be co-ordinated,' said an official yesterday, adding:
'We don't want another Dunkirk.'

FT  21 JAN 94 / Commission urges France to halt state subsidies to Groupe
Bull
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission will next week call on the French government to
suspend a final FFr2.5bn (Pounds 287m) tranche of aid to Groupe Bull, the
loss-making computer group, pending the outcome of a Commission
investigation into FFr11.1bn of subsidies.
Officials agreed yesterday that the 17 commissioners would adopt the
proposal from Mr Karel Van Miert, competition commissioner, next Wednesday
without further discussion.
The decision represents growing frustration in Brussels that the French
government has failed to provide details of its restructuring plan for Bull,
announced last October. Commission officials admitted yesterday they could
do little to force France to comply with the request. However, one official
advised the French government to act before next Wednesday's meeting to
defuse the tension over the Bull case. 'If the French have any common sense
they will send a letter to Van Miert undertaking not to pay the remaining
part of the aid,' said the official.
The Commission is already investigating a FFr2.5bn capital allocation to
Bull, granted by the previous French government, on the grounds that it may
distort competition. Commissioners will agree next week to extend that
inquiry to cover the FFr8.6bn allocation from the present government and
France Telecom, which owns 16 per cent of Bull.
Commissioners face a much more difficult decision on Mr Van Miert's
controversial proposal to block a three-way joint venture involving French,
German and Italian manufacturers of stainless steel tubes. If the deal is
opposed, it will be only the second time that the EU's 1990 merger
regulation has been used to outlaw a deal. Officials said yesterday that
they were under heavy pressure from lobbyists and trade unions to approve
the venture, but it was difficult to predict which way commissioners would
vote. The Commission is also set to wave through Mr Van Miert's proposal to
open an investigation into subsidies from the city-state of Bremen, Germany,
to Klockner-Werke's steel mill.
A decision on whether to block the subsidies will not be taken until later.
But Mr Van Miert is known to be extremely concerned about the city-state's
plan to sell the steel mill and grant a DM200m cash injection to maintain
steel-making capacity, at a time when other steelmakers are forsaking
subsidies and cutting production. Officials said yesterday the Commission
would act fast to reach a decision on the case.

FT  21 JAN 94 / Russians muscle in on oil deals
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Russia is pressing for equity shares in some of the biggest oil and gas
projects being undertaken by western companies in other former Soviet
republics, but without putting in any capital.
Lukoil, a Russian state-owned energy company, is seeking a share of oil and
natural gas fields to be developed by western companies in Kazakhstan. The
move comes only weeks after Lukoil was allowed to participate in the
Azerbaijan government's 30 per cent share of a British Petroleum-led
consortium to develop offshore Caspian Sea fields.
The company is relying on political and economic pressure from Moscow to
muscle into 'all the major oil deals' in Kazakhstan, said a western diplomat
in Alma-ata, the Kazakh capital. 'They are after an equity share in these
deals without (putting) any equity into them,' he said.
One of Lukoil's main targets is the Karachaganak gas field in northern
Kazakhstan. It is the focus of a Dollars 5bn development by British Gas and
Agip, the Italian oil company.
The Russian companies believe they have a valid claim for a share in the big
developments in neighbouring countries because they were discovered during
the Soviet era.
Oil industry experts say Russian participation in such projects should have
little direct impact on western companies, as long as the shares come out of
the host government's stakes.

FT  21 JAN 94 / Brussels wants to stop UK social policy opt-out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission wants to end Britain's social policy opt-out after
1996, it emerged yesterday.
In a confidential document sent to member governments on the working of the
social protocol agreed at Maastricht two years ago, the commission makes
clear the British opt-out must not be allowed to continue indefinitely.
'The commission firmly believes the conference of representatives of the
governments of the EU's member states to be convened in 1996 must find a way
to return to a single legal basis for community action in the social field,'
it argues.
British ministers see the opt-out as a lasting achievement that will improve
the country's competitiveness by keeping down labour costs. They believe
they are winning the argument inside the EU on the need for a more flexible
European labour market through less regulation of social affairs.
Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry,
yesterday criticised the commission's efforts to press for a shorter working
week or job-sharing as answers to European unemployment. 'These are not
viable long-term solutions,' he told a meeting of European business leaders.
'If high employment could be brought about by short working hours than
Europe would have no unemployment at all'.
Mr Davies said European workers already worked fewer hours a year than their
American or Japanese counterparts and many of the proposals on job sharing
would merely add to employer costs and increase not reduce unemployment.
He also denounced the commission's determination to introduce European-wide
works councils for large companies with plants in more than one member
state. It was inconceivable this could contribute to competitiveness or
generating employment.

FT  21 JAN 94 / Russian cabinet is unveiled as Fyodorov quits: Prime
minister declares 'the age of market romanticism is over'
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Boris Fyodorov, mainstay of Russia's market reforms, quit last night as
finance minister when a new cabinet emerged after three days of crisis
talks.
His departure throws into doubt the government's commitment to transform the
state-dominated economy and represents a shift away from attempts to
stabilise the country's finances. It may foreshadow an increase in inflation
while the government tries to focus on other policies such as ending
monopolies and stimulating economic growth.
The resignation came hours after Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, prime minister,
announced a cabinet in which Mr Fyodorov was offered the finance ministry
but was stripped of the rank of deputy prime minister.
Mr Fyodorov refused because his conditions were rejected and because he
opposed an economic blueprint.
Although details of the blueprint were not yet known, its spirit was clear
from remarks by Mr Chernomyrdin, who said 'the age of market romanticism is
over'.
Strengthened after apparently convincing President Boris Yeltsin to endorse
his cabinet line-up, Mr Chernomyrdin set out his proposals for a 'corrected
policy' which he insisted did not mean a retreat from reform. The government
would try to increase revenues and pay more of its bills, but saw a dilemma
in trying to meet spending promises.
Implying that Mr Fyodorov was not indispensable in the fight against
inflation - the enemy number one - Mr Chernomyrdin said the government would
emphasise 'non-monetary means' to fight it, like industrial demonopolisation
and wage restraint. Such policies have been proclaimed in the past by the
government, but have not so far delivered results.
The prime minister also attacked Mr Fyodorov for daring to set conditions
for joining his government. These included the removal of Mr Victor
Gerashchenko as central bank chairman, which looked likely to be rejected.
Although Mr Chernomyrdin said under the new constitution, the chairman was
nominated by the president in consultation with parliament, Mr
Gerashchenko's press office felt confident enough to announce that he was
staying on.
Mr Anatoly Chubais, who remains deputy prime minister responsible for
privatisation and is the only senior radical reformer left in the
government, reiterated charges that Mr Gerashchenko was diametrically
opposed to the reform course pursued so far. Mr Fyodorov has described the
central bank chief as the top opponent of policies to fight inflation by
restricting the growth of money supply and budget expenditure.
Further indications of the new government's course came from Mr Alexander
Shokhin, previously deputy prime minister for foreign economic relations,
who accepted the job as economics minister. Mr Shokhin, a middle of the road
reformer, said the government would try to 'cling to a corridor between
hyperinflation and a stop in industrial production'.
In the new cabinet, Mr Oleg Soskovets, who has taken a moderate path on
reform, retains the post of first deputy prime minister.
Last night the US said it would encourage Russia to implement reforms and
would work with it to the extent that it pursued policies Washington
believed could succeed.

FT  21 JAN 94 / Guinness restructures alliance with LVMH: 24% interest in
French company to be sold for Pounds 1.3bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Guinness, the UK drinks group, and LVMH, the French cognac and luxury goods
company, announced sweeping changes to their seven-year alliance yesterday
to provide 'a secure and stable basis for a continuing long-term
partnership' in the international wines and spirits industry.
Guinness is selling its indirect 24 per cent interest in LVMH, held through
Jacques Rober and Christian Dior, to the Arnault Group for Pounds 1.323bn.
The UK group will acquire a 34 per cent stake in Moet Hennessy, the LVMH
cognac and champagne business, for Pounds 902m. LVMH, in turn, will reduce
its holding in Guinness from 24 per cent to 20 per cent by June 30.
Mr Tony Greener, Guinness chairman and chief executive, said the moves
focused the partnership on the strategic development of their spirits and
wines businesses. 'Guinness will no longer have an interest in LVMH as a
whole . . . we will not be part of any new direction, media or other, that
they pursue in the future. We believe in sticking to our knitting.'
Cross-shareholdings had provided an initial solid base for the alliance, he
said. But if it had not been changed 'there was a likelihood that the
different aspirations for the development of the two companies would lead to
divergence and, potentially, friction'.
The changes were welcomed in the City of London, where investors have become
increasingly concerned about the effects on Guinness of recent moves by Mr
Bernard Arnault, LVMH chairman, into publishing and fashion.
Guinness shares rose 49p to close at 521p, but shares in LVMH fell FFr138 to
FFr3,899.
The deal will yield net cash of Pounds 416m for Guinness that will be used
to reduce borrowings to Pounds 1.4bn and gearing from 47 per cent to 37 per
cent. Annual cash flow will be improved by Pounds 14m, but earnings per
share will suffer minor dilution.
Mr Greener said the group expected 1993 profits of Pounds 905m, 4 per cent
ahead of 1992, before a UK pension charge of Pounds 30m and exceptional
charges, mainly non-cash, of Pounds 173m arising from the restructuring.
The new relationship, which ensures that Guinness can prevent any outside
takeover of the Moet Hennessy cognac and champagne brands, would strengthen
the companies' joint trading ventures, Mr Greener claimed.
The group has 17 joint trading ventures - combining Guinness brands such as
Johnnie Walker Scotch whisky and Gordon's gin with LVMH's Hennessy cognac,
Moet Chandon and Veuve Clicquot champagne - that cover the US and Mexico,
Japan, China and other Far Eastern markets.
They contributed about 25 per cent of the Pounds 769m profits in 1993 of
United Distillers, the Guinness spirits division.

FT  21 JAN 94 / Financial services reassured on industry regulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Joe Palmer used his first speech yesterday as chairman of the planned
Personal Investment Authority to tackle hostility in the financial services
industry towards the overhaul of its regulation.
There had been too many financial services 'scandals' for anyone to claim
self-regulation had been an unqualified success and that the current system
could continue without change, Mr Palmer said.
But he launched a vigorous attack on those within the industry who have
pressed for the alternative route of statutory regulation. He underlined his
belief that strong public interest representation on the PIA board was
essential to give people more confidence in the regulatory system.
Given the time-lag before any radically different regulatory system would
begin to work, he said, 'I find it incredible that anybody should seriously
suggest the best remedy for the problems which we know we have is to tear up
the system we have got and start all over again.'
The new authority is to become the single retail financial services watchdog
later this year. The plans for its 19-strong board to contain just nine
people currently working in the industry last week prompted the resignation
of one of its members and reignited controversy within the industry over the
proposals.
'As a former life assurance person myself (a former chief executive of Legal
&amp; General), I am appalled by the low esteem in which the financial services
industry is held,' Mr Palmer told a Life Assurance Association conference.
He added that the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief
regulator, was reflecting the public mood in requiring a stronger public
interest element on the PIA board.
'What we are proposing will bring solid practitioner influence to our board
without the risk of domination.'
The PIA prospectus, which will be critical in determining the industry's
response, will be published in mid February.

FT  21 JAN 94 / 'Granny' bond draws a mixed response
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An interest rate of 7 per cent gross fixed for five years was offered to
people of 65 and over by the government yesterday with the launch of the new
Pensioners' Guaranteed Income Bond from National Savings.
The bond, which goes on sale from today, will require a minimum deposit of
Pounds 500 and has a maximum of Pounds 20,000. Interest will be paid
monthly.
Though it is a five-year investment, investors will be able to withdraw
their money before then, provided that they give two months' notice and
suffer the loss of two months' interest.
Building societies yesterday expressed a mixture of relief and reservations
at the details of the bond, which has concerned them since Mr Kenneth
Clarke, the chancellor, announced it in the November Budget.
Banks and societies' five-year fixed rate bonds giving monthly interest
offer a variety of rates depending on conditions and deposit size, with many
in the 5 to 6 per cent gross range.
Mr John Wriglesworth, societies analyst at UBS, said: 'This will definitely
be tough competition for societies. There are a lot of outstanding balances
at risk.'
But most societies are unlikely to rush into revising their products until
the scale of the movement of deposits becomes clearer.
Halifax said the interest rate was not as attractive as it had expected, but
the maximum investment was higher than anticipated.
Mr Andrew Longhurst, chief executive of Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, said the
bond forced pensioners to take a view on interest rate movements.

FT  21 JAN 94 / Tories boost profile of industry policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is to raise the profile of its approach to industry in an
effort to boost exports and strengthen its industrial base.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, announced a white paper
on competitiveness which will set out the government's 'hands on' role in
'backing winners', to be published in the summer.
It will be the first white paper on the government's approach to industry
since the Conservatives came to office in 1979.
Announcing the decision to the House of Commons trade and industry committee
yesterday, Mr Heseltine said: 'Governments intervene all the time; the only
question is what form it takes.'
The white paper will emphasise 'competitiveness', emulating the language of
the Clinton administration, not old-style 'industrial policy'. Whitehall
said it would take a 'broad view' of the government's approach to Britain's
industrial weaknesses, including skills shortcomings, technology promotion
and the liaison between Whitehall and industry.
Mr Heseltine ruled out any return to large-scale public funding of
particular industrial sectors, but said government was ready to do 'anything
it reasonably can to enhance the environment within which industries can
flourish'. The white paper will take the form of a response to the trade and
industry committee's report on competitiveness in manufacturing industry,
due to be published in March. But it will concentrate on all wealth-creating
sectors.
Referring to the work of the trade and industry department's competitiveness
unit, Mr Heseltine warned the committee that Europe 'is going to have to
face up to some fairly unpalatable changes as it meets the challenge from
Asia in the next decade. . . People will not base industries in Europe out
of charity'.
He conceded that Whitehall departments were not working closely enough
together in liaising with industry, but criticised some trade associations
which, he said, 'often do not do a good job'.
In addition to the report on competitiveness, the government has conducted a
wide-ranging 'benchmarking' exercise, comparing the performance of specific
sectors with those overseas. The results are believed not to have been
published in full.
Labour members of the trade and industry committee called on the government
to provide financial help for companies involved in technological projects.
But Mr Heseltine refused to support any significant increase in subsidies.

FT  20 JAN 94 / The FT500 (46): Price war rages as clients cut costs - As
Europe struggles during an economic downturn, times are becoming
increasingly tough for the auditors. The scope for spin-off services such as
consulting has narrowed / Top Accountants
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Behind nearly every large European company is a very substantial accountancy
firm providing auditing and other business advisory services.
The six largest firms dominate client work across the continent, but are
coming under increasing competitive pressure from each other, from their
rivals and from regulators.
In the UK, the historical home of most of the firms and of accountancy as a
modern profession, there is an enormous gap in fee income between the top
six and the rest.
Coopers &amp; Lybrand alone billed Pounds 553m in the UK last year. In
descending order, the five other largest firms were KPMG Peat Marwick, Ernst
&amp; Young, Arthur Andersen, Price Waterhouse and Touche Ross. Even Touche, at
Pounds 346m, billed more than three times the amount of its next largest
rival.
Coopers also emerged as the leading firm of auditors to the top 100
companies in the UK500 with 25 clients, including one jointly held with
second-placed rival, Price Waterhouse (24). Third place went to KPMG Peat
Marwick, with 22 of the top companies, and fourth to Ernst &amp; Young.
The UK firms do not operate in isolation, however. They also dominate in all
the other European countries. According to a study paid for by the European
Commission and published in April 1992, the same firms have a stranglehold
across the rest of the continent.
The study, produced by National Economic Research Associates (Nera), a
consultancy firm, showed that they audit nearly 100 per cent of the top 200
companies in Belgium, Italy and the Netherlands, and more than 50 per cent
in Germany and Portugal, for instance.
But as much of Europe struggles during an era of economic downturn, times
are becoming increasingly tough for the accountants. The scope for spin-off
services such as consulting - never as developed elsewhere as in the UK -
has narrowed fast.
More importantly, there is a fierce price war now raging, as increasingly
aggressive marketing and shrewder clients play the firms off against each
other to keep audit fees to a minimum.
Concerns linger that 'lowballing' or 'predatory pricing' threatens to damage
the quality of auditing, although the Institute of Chartered Accountants in
England and Wales recently concluded no evidence for any such deterioration
existed.
However, accountants privately admit that it is clearly more tempting for
them to win new work at a discount than to have to sack staff and reduce
partner numbers.
New pressures are coming from legal action. For example, in Italy, racked by
recent corruption scandals and restructuring crises across the business
sector, the cry of 'where were the auditors?' is becoming common.
Price Waterhouse was the most prominent firm to be threatened with legal
action following the near collapse of Ferruzzi, which it audited.
Elsewhere, Sweden has been one of several countries to begin threatening
litigation following the crisis in the Scandinavian financial sector.
A response taken by some firms has been to create more closely integrated
international structures. Arthur Andersen has always had the advantage of
being a single firm worldwide.
Other firms, notably Price Waterhouse, have attempted recently to develop a
single European business which shares resources, and establish a common
methodology for its work.
But, as one accountant puts it, 'it's one thing to share the profits, but
people don't want to share the costs'. This is at no time more relevant than
when the writs arrive alleging negligent auditing.
The regulatory position in different countries across Europe varies widely.
Some, such as Italy and Spain, have compulsory rotation of auditors in an
effort to prevent ties becoming too close and jeopardising independence.
This creates the automatic need for competition, but the period of audit
appointment may be longer lasting than in countries such as the UK, where
annual audit reappointment approved by shareholders opens up the frequent
prospect of tendering among the firms.
A number of countries still limit the non-audit work an audit firm can carry
out, or attempt to restrict international firms entering the domestic
market. All of these issues affect competition and the structure of the
profession, although the Nera study showed how effectively the firms have
circumvented restrictions.
For example, in France the stock exchange regulator recently insisted that
its requirement for public companies to be scrutinised by two auditors
should be interpreted as two separate audit firms and not - as had become
widespread - two auditors from the same firm.
At the European Union-level, a new directive on procurement will require
utilities and other public sector organisations to put their audits out to
tender. However, the work plan for the next two years shows no hard-line
attempts to change the regulation of the auditing profession, other than an
emphasis on clarifying auditor liability.
Most of the most powerful pressures during the coming months will not be
governmental but rather harshly commercial.

FT  20 JAN 94 / The FT500 (45): Happy times for collective funds - The
return of the private investor has created a new source of demand for trust
shares and has enabled the discount to narrow to a 20-year low / Investment
Trusts

<TEXT>
These are happy times for investment trusts, the quoted collective funds
which provide an easy way for small investors to gain access to the stock
market.
Falling interest rates are persuading savers to find ways of investing in
equities, now that the yields on shares are closer to the returns available
from cash. Not only does that help share prices (and thus the asset values
of trusts), it also reduces the trust sector's long-term headache - the
discount.
The price of shares in an investment trust is set by supply and demand, and
does not necessarily correspond with the asset value of the trust. For much
of the past 20 years, the shareholder registers of many trusts have been
dominated by institutional investors - many of whom have, for historic
reasons, wanted to sell. Since supply of shares exceeded demand, trust
shares tended to trade at a discount to the asset value (eg the share price
might be 90p, while assets per share are 100p).
But the return of the private investor has created a new source of demand
for trust shares and has enabled the discount to narrow to a 20-year low.
Existing investors in trusts have therefore made a double gain.
Over the five years to January 1994, the FT Investment Trust Index rose 139
per cent, while the All-Share climbed only 116 per cent over the same
period.
This increased demand has also enabled the sector to expand by creating new
trusts. The sector had a record year for new issues in 1993, raising Pounds
1.5bn, or Pounds 2.1bn if the new Lloyd's capital trusts are excluded.
Not all of this was due to private investor enthusiasm. Institutional
investors are still willing to buy investment trusts if the area being
invested in is one where trust managers can add value.
This particularly applies to emerging markets, where not only were new
trusts launched in 1993 but existing trusts such as Templeton (23rd in the
rankings) were able to raise new money.
Emerging markets were very much the fashionable investment story of 1993.
Managers could point to the high rates of economic growth being achieved by
developing countries such as China, the financial liberalisation measures
being introduced by their governments and the under-development of their
stock markets. Furthermore such markets were individually so illiquid and
volatile that it was easy to argue that the best investment vehicle had to
be a broadly-spread collective fund.
So great has been the demand for emerging markets trusts that many have
traded at a premium to their asset values, indicating that demand is
exceeding supply and that there is still scope for emerging markets new
issues in 1994.
The biggest ever investment trust issue occurred late in the year, too late
to appear in these figures. But Mercury World Mining Trust, helped by the
reputation of manager Julian Baring and by 1993's sudden revival of interest
in gold, would leap straight into the top 10 of trusts by size.
dominated by the big international generalists and in particular by Foreign
&amp; Colonial, nearly 50 per cent larger than its nearest rival.
F&amp;C has not only kept its reputation for good investment performance but was
the first to introduce a savings scheme back in 1984, one of the measures
that has helped towards the revival of private investor interest in the
sector. The individual monthly sums invested via savings schemes may be
small but over the years they form a constant drip-feed of demand which has
helped to narrow the discount.
Like some of the other international generalists, F&amp;C has not been able to
gain significantly from the other substantial boost to private investor
demand for trusts - the personal equity plan. Pep rules only permit a trust
to qualify for the full Pounds 6,000 annual allowance if more than 50 per
cent of its portfolio is in EU equities. F&amp;C does not want its flagship
trust to be hamstrung by this requirement, and so investors can only put
Pounds 1,500 in Pep form into Britain's largest investment trust. (Emerging
markets specialists also do not qualify for the full Pounds 6,000 Pep.)
F&amp;C has other trusts within its range which do qualify under the Pep rules.
But some of the main beneficiaries of the Pep regime have been the UK blue
chip and UK income trusts, such as TR City of London, many of which stand at
asset values, or small premiums.
The very recent success of investment trusts inevitably creates dangers for
1994. The sector might over-egg the pudding by making too many new issues. A
sudden downturn in the stock market might cause the recent recruits among
private investors to panic - and offload their holdings. Either factor would
lead to a widening discount.
On the other hand, the sector has cause to be optimistic. The current
present low UK interest rate regime may survive for several more years, and
Peps appear safe while a Conservative government is in power. If it does, we
may be witnessing a historic shift of savers' incomes away from deposits and
into equity funds. There could be many more years of investment trust
expansion ahead.

FT  20 JAN 94 / The FT500 (42): Number one in the UK directory - BT has
regained its position as Britain's biggest company. Bernard Gray outlines
the technological forces which are driving the UK giant's growth / Profile
of British Telecom
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
the US long-distance telephone company which is allied to BT - announced on
January 4 that it has strategic plans to invest Dollars 20bn along with
partners in the US telecoms market over the next decade. Developments will
include a fibre-optic telecoms super-highway running from New York to Los
Angeles to compete with regional US phone companies for domestic users. The
scale of the investment required shows just how high the stakes are for
global telecommunications companies.
Technological turmoil is bringing together computer technology with
traditional phone operations. It is creating the possibility of new services
such as home shopping, consumers selecting video films to be sent down
telephone lines, and the handling of huge volumes of data at very low cost.
Yet to keep up with the rapidly developing market phone companies are going
to have to invest huge sums and form complex alliances over the next decade.
At the same time as creating the possibility of multimedia ventures,
technological change is also encouraging real competition in telecoms for
the first time. From cellular phones to cable TV, consumers now have a
choice of competing telephone networks.
So the requirement for high capital expenditure comes at the same time as
phone companies are going to have to become more efficient to offset the
lower prices which competition is likely to bring. It is going to be a
dramatic decade for phone companies.
The revolution is most advanced in the US, but is rapidly spreading to other
markets, and BT seems determined to be at the forefront of European telecoms
companies. After a couple of false starts, including an investment in McCaw
cellular, BT's international strategy is now centred on its alliance with
MCI, the second largest US long-distance phone carrier. The two companies
intend to set up an operation to cater for the complex requirements of large
multinational companies. Sophisticated computer programmes developed for
these needs may also have spin-offs in more mundane domestic services. For
example, customers may be able to have a single telephone number which
follows them wherever they go.
BT is tackling the US and international markets first because they are the
most open to competition. Yet even here the company is restricted in what it
can do. US regulations severely limit foreign ownership of telecoms
companies. And while services to multinational companies may provide
high-margin business, the market is strictly limited.
In Europe, telecoms are highly protected and the main voice communications
market is unlikely to be opened up before 1998. Even then, if previous
deregulation is any guide, progress in implementing open markets may be
slow.
In its domestic market BT is also hedged about. Since it already has such a
large market share it has been prevented from competing directly with the
growing cable TV companies which are providing a full range of TV channels
as well as telephone services.
BT is thus caught in something of a bind. The market is changing rapidly,
yet the company can only gain limited access to most interesting areas. At
the same time BT, in common with many other telecoms companies, is having to
make the transition from a vast state-owned public-service bureaucracy to a
flexible and responsive high-technology company. The challenge of
transforming an organisation, which by rumour used to have more vehicles
than the Red Army, is huge. Not only do work practices have to be changed,
but the culture has to be shifted so that the staff are focused on providing
services demanded by customers, rather than the structure suiting itself. At
the same time the company has to cope with the strains involved in a huge
reduction in staff numbers.
According the chairman, Sir Iain Vallance, much progress has already been
made. Several initiatives have been launched to transform the company. Most
significant of which was the Project Sovereign which was visible to the
outside world as the change in corporate logo and identity, but which
involved adopting total quality management values and encouraging employees
to focus on customers needs.
Many of those employees who did not like the new ethos or found it difficult
to adapt have left over the years in one or other of companies redundancy
programmes. Beside, as Sir Iain points out, 'it is now almost exactly 10
years since BT was privatised, so the natural turnover of staff means that
many staff have never worked in the public sector. We now have the younger
more responsive workforce that this industry needs.'
The company is also encouraging new attitudes by ring-fencing growth areas
such as cellular communications and international services to try to prevent
old-style bureaucracy from strangling innovation. If BT can inculcate a
genuinely entrepreneurial and innovative service culture among its staff,
and overcome the barriers to competing in Europe and the US, it could be one
of the telecom companies to do well in the new world. It is at least well
ahead of those continental European PTT's which still luxuriate in state
control.

FT  20 JAN 94 / The FT500 (36): West End still the favourite location - Rhys
David scrutinises the addresses of corporate Britain and discovers that
London remains the business capital, with Birmingham the runner-up and
Reading edging out Edinburgh and Leeds for third place / UK500 Corporate
Headquarters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Business bosses may complain about the congestion on the roads and troubles
on the trains but the West End of London is still the place most favoured by
British companies for their headquarters. See map on page 24.)
The area which takes in Oxford Street and Mayfair and extends through
Kensington towards London Airport, boasts 57 corporate headquarters, five
more than the City of London with 52, and 15 ahead of south-west London, the
area incorporating Knightsbridge and Chelsea, and extending south into
Wimbledon.
London's dominant position overall as the business capital of the UK emerges
from an analysis of the addresses of the top 500 (to be published next month
in an expanded reprint of the FT500).
In spite of the relocations that have taken place over recent years to towns
around the M25 orbital motorway, and in some cases to other parts of the
country, the London postal districts combined still account for 198 or
roughly 40 per cent of all UK500 company headquarters.
There are, nevertheless, some surprises in the location list, which uses UK
post code areas - in effect Britain's city regions - as its geographical
basis. Birmingham, with 21 headquarters justifies its claim to be Britain's
second business centre. Somewhat more unexpectedly, Reading, a beneficiary
of some out-of-London moves,is the next most popular provincial location,
and home to 13 companies.
Edinburgh and Leeds with 12 each - a score also equalled by Slough - are
ahead of their usually higher-profile rivals, Glasgow and Manchester, and
unfashionable Bradford also scores well with nine company headquarters.
A number of big cities such as Bristol, Cardiff, Coventry and Sheffield fare
relatively badly with only two apiece, while Aberdeen, in spite of its
position as Britain's oil capital, boasts only one, as also do Portsmouth,
Southampton, and Croydon.
Former new towns Hemel Hempstead, Milton Keynes, and Peterborough, (six
each), all figure more strongly, with Liverpool and Derby on the same total,
ahead of Huddersfield, Nottingham, Warrington and Redhill on five.
Regionally, Yorkshire with the headquarters of 40 quoted companies, the West
Midlands (38), the Thames Valley (35) and the North West (34) are Britain's
most significant regions outside London, followed by Scotland (33).
Outside these areas company headquarters are thinly spread, with Wales, the
West of England, East Anglia, Northern Ireland and the North East, home to
only a few companies with strong local roots.
In the European list (see chart on page 35) the UK, with Europe's big stock
market, is dominant with 187 out of the total of 500 top companies or
roughly 37 per cent of the total. The UK share of the list's total market
capitalisation is similar at 37 per cent - Dollars 828.5bn out of Dollars
2,213.8bn.
France has the second highest number of companies in the list (77) but at
Dollars 310.2bn, their market capitalisation lags slightly behind that of
Germany whose 67 companies were valued at Dollars 315.2bn. Netherlands has
17 companies with a market capitalisation of Dollars 187.5bn.
Italy, in spite of the size of its economy, manages only 25 companies in the
list, valued at Dollars 84.7bn, slightly ahead of much smaller Sweden, which
has 22 companies valued at Dollars 83.4bn. Spain has only two fewer
companies in the list than Italy but their combined capitalisation, Dollars
85.2bn, is marginally greater. By contrast, its Iberian neighbour at the
bottom of the list, Portugal, has only one representative, three fewer than
Ireland, Luxembourg and Austria.

FT  20 JAN 94 / The FT500 (35): Conglomerates illustrate a paradox - The
prices which rose most sharply last year were those of shares themselves. As
a result, some of the star performers have been from the City / Focus on the
UK 500
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
There is a curious paradox lurking in this year's UK industrial rankings. On
the one hand, BTR has moved from 11th place to 8th, while Hanson has held
its position at 9th. Conglomerates, it seems, are a good thing.
On the other hand, look at Imperial Chemical Industries. Last year ICI
decided it was too much like a conglomerate for comfort, and split itself in
two: a new high-tech company called Zeneca, and a new ICI taking in bulk
chemicals. The combined value of the two is now Pounds 12bn, which would
rank ICI in its old form as 10th in the UK, displacing Marks and Spencer.
The year before, ICI only ranked 16th. So conglomerates, it seems, are a bad
thing after all.
In fact, both sides of the paradox make perfect sense in their own terms.
The relevant characteristic of both BTR and Hanson is that they are well and
conservatively managed. It is this, quite as much as their diversity, that
equips them to survive in the present tough economic conditions. It is worth
recalling that the biggest company in the US by market value is now a
quintessential conglomerate, General Electric, with activities ranging from
stockbroking to building locomotives. Again, the relevant characteristic is
management. Mr Jack Welch, GE's boss, is perhaps the most admired manager in
the US.
As for ICI, the fact that it has been able to add value by splitting itself
up is perhaps not surprising. Successive generations of ICI management have
toyed with the idea for decades, if only on the grounds that making
investment decisions across the range of ICI's businesses was becoming
increasingly hard as the technology became more sophisticated. Other members
of the top 100 companies in the UK, such as Vodafone and Courtaulds, are the
successful products of demerger. The argument for and against conglomerates
is an interesting one in theory. In practice, it seems, it is more a matter
of horses for courses.
The rankings contain another wider paradox, this time to do with the theme
of inflation. The single biggest reason for the strength of the UK stock
market in the past year has been the realisation that stable prices may not
be a mere cyclical phenomenon, but part of a deeper economic shift.
But that same factor has resulted in some of the year's biggest casualties.
The big supermarket chains, for instance, need rising prices to ensure high
margins, which in turn are needed to finance their ambitious expansion
programmes. Unsurprisingly, therefore, Sainsbury and Tesco have taken a
hammering. Some of the smaller supermarket chains have fared even worse:
William Low, which last year was a respectable 360th, is now within an ace
of falling out of the rankings.
Similarly, the soaring share price of Guinness in the late 1980s was based
above all on persuading Scotch drinkers around the world to pay
ever-increasing prices for their tipple on the basis of its snob appeal. In
a world of stable prices, that game is over. Guinness has fallen from 8th to
16th. The niche malt whisky maker Macallan-Glenlivet has slumped from 282 to
383.
On the other hand, look at British Steel. This, one would think, must surely
have been a casualty last year. The business press has been full of the
crisis in Europe's steel industry, and of faltering attempts to cut
capacity. But on the contrary, British Steel has been a star performer,
jumping from 90th to 59th. The reason - and here is the real paradox - is
that it has successfully raised its prices several times in the past year.
British Steel is not alone. The building materials companies such as Redland
and Blue Circle have also raised prices, and have jumped in the ratings
accordingly. There is a further twist. Part of the reason for these
companies' strong performance is linked to the property market: Land
Securities and MEPC, for instance, have also risen sharply in the ratings.
This is because the market detects signs of recovery in property: that is,
prices are rising again.
From a purely industrial viewpoint, the net effect of all this is slightly
depressing. Of the 49 sectors in the London equity market, 22 consist of
companies which actually make things. Of those, only four rose in the
rankings last year: building materials, housebuilding, fabricated metals
(largely steel) and aerospace. The first three have been touched on: the
fourth is chiefly based on the remarkable recovery at British Aerospace,
which in turn owes much to the renaissance of BAe's Rover subsidiary.
Less cheerfully, 10 of the industrial sectors fell in the rankings. Again,
the sectors worst affected have been those most hit by falling prices - in
particular, drugs, tobacco and drink.
It is an illustration of the global effects of deflation that in drugs and
tobacco particularly, the bad news has come from the US. For drugs, the
deciding factor has been President Clinton's campaign to reduce health
costs. For tobacco, it was Philip Morris's dramatic decision last April to
slash the price of Marlboro cigarettes.
But from an investment viewpoint, none of this is a reason to be
down-hearted. After all, the prices which rose most sharply in the UK last
year were those of shares themselves. As a result, some of the star
performers in the rankings have been from the City. The stockbroking firm
Smith New Court has come from nowhere to enter the rankings at 381. The
merchant bank Schroders went from 130 to 90. Along with its fellow merchant
bank Warburg, it won itself a place last year in the FT-SE index of
Britain's 100 biggest companies.
The fact that hopes of a reviving economy have principally benefited folk in
the City is scarcely surprising. Indeed, it illustrates to perfection an old
maxim in stockbroking. The way to make money, says the maxim, is as follows:
find out where the action is - diamonds in South Africa, oil in the North
Sea - and go there. But whatever you do, do not get involved in diamonds or
oil yourself. Sell sandwiches.

FT  20 JAN 94 / The FT500 (34): Global giants braced for restructuring -
Emiko Terazono discusses the effect of one of the most severe economic
downturns in post-war history on the performance of leading Japanese groups

The FT's list of top Japanese companies by market capitalisation reflects a
period of sagging share prices as a result of one of the most severe
economic downturns in post-war history.
Nevertheless, even with the Nikkei average off 48 per cent from its peak in
1989, companies topping the Japan 100 list are among the largest in the
world by market capitalisation. The relatively large market capitalisation
of Japanese companies is the result of share prices being swollen by
strategic cross shareholding among the country's companies and banks.
Aggressive fund-raising on the stock markets during the late 1980s
accelerated companies' moves towards stable shareholding, resulting in fewer
floating shares in the market. At the end of 1992, 73.1 per cent of the
Tokyo stock market was held by financial and non-financial corporations.
The traditional custom of placing funds into stock and stock assets prompted
investors to pump extra cash into the Tokyo market in the 1980s, pushing
prices higher. Meanwhile, the absence of a merger and acquisition market
deprived investors of a chance to test share prices and valuations, leaving
share prices distorted.
Mr Alex Kinmont, strategist at Morgan Stanley in Tokyo, believes that if the
cross shareholding structure and fund-raising patterns were adjusted to
match western standards, the market capitalisation of companies would fall
by half from the present levels.
Another aspect of Japanese companies is the low return on capital employed.
The figures reflect low awareness of capital cost among Japanese companies,
which have traditionally relied on banks for funding. Rather than a place to
raise capital, for many of the blue chips companies the equity market has
been regarded as a place to acquire status within the business community.
Many companies have invested funds raised through equity-linked financing
during the late 1980s into companies within the keiretsu (corporate grouping
structures) and the industry. Considering the low dividends of Japanese
companies the returns on such investments have been insignificant.
The vast market capitalisation of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT),
which ranks first, is justified by its large scale of assets and businesses,
which could be spun off as separate companies in the future.
However, its shares are held by financial and industrial companies,
especially of those electronic and telecommunication equipment corporations
which comprise the 'NTT family'.
NTT, which became a private company in 1986, is suffering the effects of
greater competition, and profits last year fell 44 per cent to Y205.8bn. The
company is seeking to cut about 10,000 employees from its payroll through
voluntary retirement by the end of next year.
The deteriorating business outlook is depressing NTT's share price, hence
eroding unrealised profits of companies which hold its stock.
The leading commercial banks, which follow NTT on the rankings list, are at
the core of the keiretsu, or corporate groupings tied together by cross
shareholdings. They also buy stocks of companies they lend to, and vice
versa, hence, are at the centre of a complicated web of cross shareholdings.
For the banks, holding a company's stock was a way to maintain relationships
with companies and, at the same time, wield influence over corporate
decisions. For the companies, such shareholdings acted as a form of
insurance that the banks would stand behind them in times of financial
difficulty.
However, due to mounting bad loans stemming from the reckless lending of the
late 1980s, the banks are finding it more difficult to maintain such ties.
Problem loans rose 9.6 per cent during the first half of the business year
to September, and the banks are realising profits on long-term stock
holdings to cover the losses from writing off such loans. Dai-Ichi Kangyo
Bank, for example, took profits of Y52.2bn during the period.
The banks may see lower market capitalisation in the future as they are
forced to unravel more of their cross shareholdings as a fall in fund demand
from companies depresses profits, while at the same time, the weak stock
market erodes its unrealised stock-holding gains.
Toyota Motor, ranked seventh, is a company supported by a typical industrial
keiretsu and cross-shareholding relationship which includes component
suppliers, specialised manufacturers, and distributors.
Almost all large manufacturers, such as Nissan, Hitachi, and Matsushita
Electric Industrial, have their own keiretsu. However, such relationships
are also slowly loosening as companies are forced to supplement their
falling profits with gains on shareholdings.
The large manufacturers are also reviewing existing relationships with their
group suppliers, telling them to reduce their reliance on the company at the
core of the grouping.
The downturn in the economy is accelerating the rise in awareness about the
cost of capital. Some companies already recognise the importance of
profitability, especially new industries which are not bound by old ties.
Nintendo, the video game maker, ranked 49th, has a 26.5 per cent return on
capital employed, while Seven-Eleven Japan, the convenience store chain,
ranked 18th, has a return on capital of 18.5 per cent.
As corporate profits and share prices remain in the doldrums, more companies
will be forced to unwind cross shareholdings. Although the
cross-shareholding structure of the traditional type keiretsu such as the
Mitsubishi and the Mitsui groups, will take time to disappear, relationships
between companies on the fringe of such groupings are likely to diminish.
In the long run, companies will be forced to use capital more efficiently,
and although it may not happen immediately, market capitalisation of the
Tokyo stock market will decline as companies will value profits over
relationships.
In addition, with the present restructuring of companies, which is likely to
lead to a review of traditional practices, such as life-time employment, and
with shareholders eventually gaining more strength due to legal changes in
the commercial code, return on capital employed is likely to increase
gradually.

FT  20 JAN 94 / The FT500 (33): Chrysler accelerates as GM changes gear -
The table of top US companies graphically underlines the way in which
different companies have responded to the technological and competitive
challenges reshaping the business landscape / United States
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Just two years ago the largest American company, ranked by market
capitalisation, was that long-time bellwether of US stock market sentiment,
International Business Machines.
Today, IBM ranks a mere 25th in the FT's table of top US companies, and its
market capitalisation has more than halved from 1990's Dollars 62bn to
today's Dollars 24bn, following a plunge in the company's share price in
1992 and early 1993.
Behind the plunge lay a sudden realisation that IBM was facing serious
structural problems, notably shrinking demand for mainframe computers - a
sector it dominates - and fierce competition from low-cost rivals in the
personal computer market, which has snatched much of the mainframe's
business.
IBM now ranks behind Intel, the world's largest computer chip manufacturer,
which is 17th in the FT table. Ironically, Intel owes its lofty position in
no small measure to IBM, thanks to the company's decision in 1980 to use one
of Intel's microprocessors at the heart of its first personal computer. The
design went on to become an industry standard.
Similarly, Microsoft, the leading American computer software manufacturer,
which ranks 27th, got its big break when IBM chose the then tiny company to
provide the operating software for its first PC.
IBM's decline is one of the most dramatic examples of changing corporate
fortune in the FT's table of top American corporations.
The table - the first American rankings published by the paper as part of
its annual FT500 survey - graphically underlines the way in which different
US companies have responded to the technological and competitive challenges
which have been reshaping the American business landscape.
Part of IBM's problem has been a complacent, inward-looking corporate
culture - the result of its industrial dominance in the 1960s and 1970s -
which prevented it from seeing just how rapidly the computer sector's
micro-processor revolution was undermining its competitiveness.
A similar complacency characterised General Motors, America's largest
industrial employer, for many years, allowing Japanese competitors to cut
deep into its share of the US car market. After several years of heavy
losses, it is now in the throes of a difficult restructuring aimed at
cutting its costs to match its much reduced market position.
Its problems, which will take years to solve, are reflected in its modest
16th place in the FT rankings, giving it a market capitalisation of Dollars
30bn.
It ranks just six places ahead of the substantially smaller Ford Motor,
capitalised at Dollars 27bn, which moved much earlier to cut its US costs
and improve plant productivity.
Chrysler, the smallest of Detroit's Big Three, ranks 46th, with a market
capitalisation of Dollars 17bn, which represents a huge improvement for a
company that in 1990 appeared in danger of financial crisis, facing the
start of a US recession with a tired product line. At that time, its market
capitalisation was just Dollars 4bn and it ranked around 150th among leading
companies.
However, over the past two years Chrysler has staged a remarkable recovery,
both in profitability and share price performance, as it has introduced a
succession of excitingly styled, well-selling new models.
General Electric owes its position as America's largest company to the
success of its top management, notably Mr Jack Welch, the chairman, in
preventing a spirit of complacency spreading within an organisation which
has long been one of the nation's industrial giants.
When Mr Welch took over as GE chairman in the early 1980s, he realised that,
despite the organisation's apparent success, its hodge-podge of businesses
was ill-equipped to compete in a world of intensifying global competition.
He slashed staff, bought and sold divisions, and transformed the group's
business culture, with the aim of giving the organisation the attitudes of a
small, nimble, entrepreneurial company. The result has been strong
productivity and earnings growth for much of the past decade. The leading US
oil companies have long enjoyed a prominent position among America's largest
companies, with their precise positions depending in considerable measure on
the fluctuations in the price of crude oil and gasoline.
The weak global oil market has recently held back the earnings of the US
majors, though their share price performance appears to have been bolstered
over the past year by their high dividend yields, against a background of
falling interest rates.
Exxon, long the largest of the group, is ranked second in the FT table, with
Mobil following in ninth position, Chevron 11th and Amoco 19th.
One of the most dramatic industrial developments in the US over the past
year has been a spate of takeover bids in the telecommunications and media
businesses, as companies jockey for position ahead of the much-heralded
multimedia information technology revolution.
A leading participant in this unheaval is American Telephone and Telegraph,
the long-distance telecommunications and computer company, which is by far
the largest US company in the sector, ranking third in the FT table, with a
market capitalisation of Dollars 79bn.
The next largest in the sector is GTE, the telecommunications company that
serves markets scattered across the US. It ranks seventh, with a market
capitalisation of Dollars 36bn, ahead of the largest 'Baby Bell' local phone
company, BellSouth, which is capitalised at Dollars 30bn and ranks 15th. The
'Baby Bells' are so-called because they were spun off from AT&amp;T in 1984.
Among retailing companies, Wal-Mart Stores, the discount chain based in
Arkansas, continues to consolidate its position as the biggest powerhouse in
the sector, expanding its square footage across the US with its successful
formula of low prices, good customer relations and efficient back-office
operations. It ranks fourth in the FT table, with a market capitalisation of
nearly Dollars 57bn, up from around Dollars 27bn in 1990, when it was about
the 10th largest company in the nation.

FT  20 JAN 94 / The FT500 (31): Shopkeepers suffer a fall in fortunes -
Europe's leading companies now face a challenge from US warehouse operators
/ Sector Analyses - Retailing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY

<TEXT>
On the evidence of the FT500, Britain really does appear to be a nation of
shopkeepers.
Of the 37 retailers in the table, 17 are British, and UK companies fill
seven of the top 10 positions in the retail list. Next comes France with
nine, Germany with six, Belgium with two, and Spain, Italy and the
Netherlands with one each.
That gives a slightly misleading impression of the UK's retailing strength.
The reason is that several of Europe's biggest retailers, such as Germany's
Tengelmann and Metro, are private companies or co-operatives, and so do not
appear in the list.
Based on turnover rather than market capitalisation, nine of the top 10
European companies are German or French, with only one UK company - J.
Sainsbury - sneaking into the table.
But the FT500 does accurately reflect the less than sparkling fortunes of
many of Europe's top retailers last year, thanks to continuing recession and
slow growth in consumer consumption. Some 20 of the 37 have gone down, while
only 13 have gone up. The UK's Marks and Spencer, still the highest-placed
retailer in the 500, is unchanged at 22.
There are, however, three new entries. Highest, at 303, is
Pinault-Printemps, the group formed in December 1992 by the merger of
France's Pinault and Au Printemps.
The UK fashion retailer Next, one of the most successful retailers of the
1980s, has re-entered the list at 445. After over-expanding and
over-borrowing by the end of the decade, it is now staging a recovery,
having closed some stores and cut costs, and announced in September an
almost three-fold increase in interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 23m.
The third new entrant, at 458, is La Rinascente, Italy's biggest retailer,
and one of the few big players in one of Europe's least-developed retail
markets.
It has spent L300bn a year for the past four years on expansion, and
turnover in its supermarkets and hypermarkets has more than doubled, while
sales in its DIY chain have more than trebled.
But the main feature of the retailing list is the number of fallers. Five of
the 25 biggest fallers in the FT500 are retailers.
It is perhaps not surprising that two are UK food retailers. The food
retailing sector underperformed the UK stock market by more than 30 per cent
in 1993, amid fears that the creeping saturation of the superstore market,
the rapid growth of discount retailers - several of them recent entrants
from continental Europe such as Germany's Aldi, Denmark's Netto and France's
Ed - and the resulting upsurge in price competition, meant the biggest
players' profits growth was under threat.
It is perhaps more surprising that the two chains should be Kwik Save, the
UK's leading discounter, and Wm Morrison Supermarkets, the regional
superstore chain voted the UK's top performing company by the Institute of
Directors in 1992.
Ironically, Kwik Save remains one of the most profitable companies in Europe
on a return on capital employed basis, achieving 44.4 per cent. But the
retailer's share price has been hit by fears that it may be squeezed between
the new generation of discounters and the more price-aggressive superstores,
while Morrison's shares declined after disappointing results in September
and a warning that pressure on its margins meant profits were unlikely to
rise in line with sales over the next year.
The UK's three biggest food retailers were all affected. J. Sainsbury fell
from 26 to 39, Tesco from 63 to 95, and Argyll from 73 to 114. Other large
fallers include Belgium's two biggest retailers, Delhaize and GIB. The
latter, which fell from 176 to 327, has suffered from the malaise affecting
the Belgian retail sector. That resulted from a significant slowdown in the
growth of private consumption in 1993, due to higher taxes on income, energy
and stock exchange transactions.
The biggest factor in the decline of Delhaize, from 300 to 437, is probably
the performance of US subsidiary Food Lion, which accounts for 64 per cent
of group earnings. Sales were affected by a highly negative US television
documentary, which centred on the problems of food handling and sanitation
in the meat area of Food Lion stores. In another recent setback, Food Lion
had to pay Dollars 16.2m to the US Department of Labor for violating federal
overtime and child labour laws.
In addition to its fallers, however, the UK provides the only two retailers
in the top 25 biggest risers: Burton, the country's second-largest clothing
retailing group, and Asda, the fourth-biggest grocery superstore chain. Both
 -like fashion retailer Next - are leading retailers of the 1980s which lost
their way at the end of the decade through over-expanding and over-borrowing
and are now staging a recovery.
Another big riser was France's Castorama Dubois - a newcomer to the FT500
last year.
The outlook for European retailers remains tough, however. With powerful
discount formats such as warehouse club operator Costco now crossing the
Atlantic, and several others likely to follow, European groups may face a
significant challenge in their home markets just as they start to pull out
of recession.

FT  20 JAN 94 / The FT500 (32): Good news in rather short supply -
Conditions in many western markets remained weak, and 17 of the 26 companies
slipped down the rankings and six managed to rise / Sector Analyses -

<TEXT>
After a year of unprecedented recession for many continental European
engineering companies, good news from the FT 500 rankings is, not
surprisingly, in rather short supply.
Mechanical engineering companies in particular have had a tough time, with
demand in Germany falling through 1993 and showing only a few small signs
yet of 'bottoming out'. Overall, demand for engineering products has
recovered in the UK, but the upturn lacks conviction.
Using a reasonably broad definition, there are 26 engineering companies in
the FT 500. Apart from the 15 classed as engineering companies, it makes
sense to add companies such as Siemens, General Electric Company, BTR and
Alcatel Alsthom, which have big engineering interests, and companies such as
Asea Brown Boveri and Electrolux, respectively Europe's largest electrical
engineering group and white goods group.
On this basis, 17 of the 26 companies slipped down the rankings and six
managed to rise. There were two new entrants, Schindler, the Swiss lifts and
escalators producer, and FKI, the UK electrical engineering concern.
Significantly perhaps, four of the six companies that improved their
position were British-based - BTR, GEC, Siebe and Lucas Industries. This
partially reflects their relatively stronger home markets, but also the fact
that their commitment to cutting costs, raising productivity and profits is
more long-established than is the case with many continental companies.
However, the relatively small declines in the rankings for many of the FT
500 companies is a testament to the importance now attached to drastic
internal improvements aimed at enhancing their resilience against market
downturns.
ABB, which slipped from 40th to 47th, is a case in point. In November, the
Swiss/Swedish group announced a 13 per cent increase in operating earnings
after depreciation for the first nine months of 1993 - to Dollars 1.42bn
from Dollars 1.26bn. Adjusted for exchange rate fluctuations and expressed
in local currencies, the rise is even more impressive at 27 per cent.
Yet conditions in many western markets remained weak, especially in
continental Europe, said ABB. The result illustrates the productivity gains
achieved by ABB while large parts of the industrialised world have remained
in a prolonged recession. Restructuring is being accelerated to reduce
break-even points further.
Perhaps the most surprising performance in the FT 500 rankings was that of
Mannesmann, the German industrial, engineering and telecommunications group
which has risen from 96th to 89th place. In August, the Dusseldorf-based
company reported a plunge into losses of DM467m in the first half of 1993,
down from a profit of DM15m in the first half of 1992.
The group said it expects to make a substantial loss for all of 1993.
Significantly, though, this reflects the costs of a one-off restructuring,
which should lead to a large reduction in the group's break-even level. So
Mannesmann expects a substantial improvement in the group's results for 1994
even if the economy continues to weaken - helping to explain the group's
good performance in the rankings.
Even so, Mannesmann's return on capital employed, based on 1992 figures, is
low enough at 3.1 per cent to put it at 13th in the FT 500 list of 25 least
profitable companies, so there is room for improvement.
Fortunately Mannesmann is the only engineering group on this list, but SKF,
the Swedish roller bearings producer, appears in 23rd place on the list for
largest swings to losses. In fact, it suffered a much heavier loss in 1992
but there are now signs of an improvement in outlook - not soon enough,
however, to prevent the company dropping from 278th to 328th.
Only Lucas Industries of the UK manages to creep in at 12th in the list of
largest increases in profit. Lucas, which recently ended a long search for a
new chief executive by appointing Rover Group executive George Simpson,
continued to benefit in 1993 from the extensive restructuring announced a
year earlier. Cost-cutting enabled pre-tax profits to rise from Pounds 22.5m
to Pounds 50.3m in the year ended July 31, and the company's FT ranking has
improved from 385th in 1992 to 336th.
The new entrants have arrived via different routes. Schindler has rebuilt
its position in the world escalator market over the past five years, while
FKI has set out on a strategy of boosting profitability and achieved
considerable success so far.
The departures were Glasgow-based Weir Group, the well-regarded pump
manufacturer which was ranked at 488th in 1992, and Trelleborg (466th in
1992), the Swedish mining and industrial group.

FT  20 JAN 94 / The FT500 (30): Wall of money seeks bricks and mortar - The
stock market values of companies in the UK have rebounded strongly. John
Thornhill considers whether this turnaround will lead to a recovery in
Europe / Sector Analyses - Property
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Even a cursory glance at the property companies in the FT500 list is enough
to highlight the two most significant trends in the European market this
year.
The UK property sector has experienced a striking reversal of fortune. The
stock market values of UK property companies have rebounded strongly,
lifting Land Securities and MEPC far higher in the rankings and pushing four
UK companies back into the list.
By contrast, many segments of the property markets in mainland Europe have
remained mired in recession with the one Dutch and two French companies
included in the FT500 slipping further down the list.
With hindsight, the turning point for UK property came when the pound fell
out of the exchange rate mechanism in September 1992, enabling the
government to cut interest rates. The surge in equities and the subsequent
drop in long-dated gilts yields highlighted the comparatively attractive
returns from property. The double-digit yields then available on prime
property stimulated interest among institutional and overseas buyers. A wall
of money, estimated at up to Pounds 10bn, began searching for a home in
bricks and mortar.
This wave of investment has resulted in a sharp decline in property yields.
But, as usual, the stock market was quick to anticipate the trend. Property
is inherently a lumpy, illiquid class of asset and shares are more readily
tradeable. Since the pound's departure from the ERM, the quoted property
sector has almost tripled in value to Pounds 15bn.
Property companies have been quick to take advantage of this flush of
enthusiasm. Many companies with heavy debts and stretched balance sheets
eagerly sought the chance to tap the stock market for fresh funds.
The biggest UK property companies raised some Pounds 1.4bn of equity
finance, helping to expand the sector's market capitalisation and secure the
company's dividend base.
Britain's largest property company, Land Securities, has jumped 28 places up
the FT500 rankings to 108. MEPC, which struggled during recession because of
its exposure to the London office market, registered one of the largest
rises in the list, climbing from 299 to 193.
Four other UK property companies, which were among Europe's biggest 500
companies before recession struck, have returned to the rankings. British
Land excited considerable interest in the sector by linking up with Mr
George Soros, the hedge fund manager. Slough Estates, which concentrates
mainly on industrial property, has seen activity pick up quicker than in
previous recoveries. And Hammerson Property and Great Portland Estates are
expected to show a marked improvement in asset values given their weightings
in the commercial office sector.
But although the investment and equity markets have rocketed, the underlying
health of the property market has remained fragile. The worry for UK
property companies is that the striking turnaround in sentiment has not yet
been matched by a commensurate improvement in the fundamentals of the
underlying property market.
Many sectors of the market are still suffering the effects of the huge
surplus of space that came on stream in the 1980s. Rents for many types of
properties are continuing to fall and the worst-hit sectors, such as office
property in the west end of London, have experienced a 60 per cent fall in
rental levels since their peak in 1990.
Office rents in many parts of the UK will remain under pressure as service
companies shed staff to improve productivity levels. Employment levels in
other parts of the economy may only pick up slowly.
In mainland Europe, the effects of recession are still evident in many areas
of the property market although it is difficult to generalise about various
patterns in different sectors and regions. The Paris office market has
fallen away sharply with overcapacity increasing and rental levels recording
steep declines.
But the two French companies in the FT500 rankings have remained largely
immune from these problems given their exposure to the residential market.
Both Sefimeg and Simco have provided a relatively safe haven for investors
in the French property sector and have experienced only marginal falls in
the rankings. That stability, though, may count against them in investors'
eyes in the upturn when those companies more highly geared to recovery
experience a faster rebound in earnings and asset values.
A similar story may hold true for Rodamco, the Dutch property company, which
has slipped only slightly in the rankings from 130 to 135. Its diversified
international portfolio has given it protection in the downturn in mainland
Europe. Earlier this month, Rodamco forecast unchanged net profits and
dividends for the year and substantially lower write-downs on property,
largely as a result of a positive contribution from its UK investments.
Those investors brave enough to invest in the UK in the trough of recession
have already seen substantial returns. If all the investment funds seeking a
home in the UK cannot be absorbed, the braver souls may see attractions in
picking up assets in the most cyclically depressed markets of mainland
Europe.

FT  20 JAN 94 / The FT500 (29): Wonder stocks lose their allure - Apart from
Roche, the drugs sector had a poor year. The recession also undermined the
standings of many chemical companies / Sector Analyses - Pharmaceuticals and
Chemicals
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The wonder stocks of late 1980s and early 1990s, pharmaceuticals companies
had a mixed year last year. While a few, such as Roche of Switzerland and
Schering of Germany, did more than creditably, others gave their investor
relations officers some considerable problems explaining their performance.
Overall, the drugs sector endured a poor year. Of Europe's top 10 pure
pharmaceuticals stocks, six saw their position in the FT500 fall and two
were stationary, while only two - Roche and Schering - moved up the
rankings.
The reasons for such a disappointing performance were not hard to find.
Healthcare reform implemented in Germany and Italy knocked sales back. IMS
International, the market research group, estimated European pharmacy drugs
sales in the seven largest markets were static during the first nine months
last year. That compared with 8 per cent growth during the whole of 1992.
The German market during the first nine months was down 10 per cent and
Italian sales down 3 per cent.
At the same time, pharmaceuticals stocks suffered from fears about President
Clinton's healthcare reforms. These were delayed from the spring to the
autumn, adding uncertainty. Investors remained wary of the sector's shares
as analysts attempted to estimate the impact of the plan on drugs groups'
profits.
The outstanding exception to the rule was Roche whose market capitalisation
overtook not only Glaxo, Europe's largest drugs company by sales, but also
Merck &amp; Co of the US, the world's largest pharmaceuticals company. The Swiss
group marched up the FT500 from sixth position in 1992 to third last year.
Roche's outstanding year was partly because it was relatively immune to the
US healthcare reform. Although about 40 per cent of its drugs division's
sales are in the US, about half of these are to hospitals which are not
affected by President Clinton's proposals. In addition, the group has a
strong portfolio of new drugs driving impressive volume growth.
US brokers Lehman Brothers expect Roche to generate volume growth of 13 per
cent until late 1995, an impressive achievement in such a difficult
healthcare environment. They forecast Roche's pre-tax profits to increase
from SFr2.6bn in 1992 to SFr3bn last year and SFr3.6bn this year.
Schering's performance last year has also been impressive, its position
rising from 155 to 137. The company has sold its chemical operations and
merged its troubled agrochemicals business with that of Hoechst, enabling it
to become a pure pharmaceuticals company. At the same time, it revealed
Betaseron, the first effective treatment for multiple sclerosis. Goldman
Sachs expects compound earnings growth this year and next to be an
impressive 30 per cent.
Institut Merieux, the French group, moved up from 253 to 216 as its vaccines
operations continued to perform well.
The rest of the sector disappointed, unable to escape investors' fears about
the market and their decision to switch into cyclical stocks capable of
benefiting from an economic recovery.
Glaxo's market capitalisation suffered considerably over the past 12 months,
and its ranking fell from second to seventh. Astra, the Swedish group and
Glaxo's main rival, remained static at 32nd. Locally its shares did well,
but in dollar terms it was held back by the devaluation of the Swedish
krona.
Sandoz of Switzerland slipped from 20 to 21, while its neighbour Ciba
dropped from 24 to 26. Bayer of Germany was static at 34th.
Among the British stocks, SmithKline Beecham fell from 11 to 23 as it was
hit hard by the Italian reforms. Fears about the expiry this year of the US
patents for its important ulcer treatment Tagamet also undermined support
for the shares.
Wellcome dropped from 29 to 59 after disappointing underlying growth from
its top-selling anti-viral product Zovirax. Preliminary results from an
Anglo-French trial which suggested AZT, its treatment for Aids and HIV,
might not be effective in HIV-positive people without symptoms, hit both the
shares and sales.
The once high-flying Fisons dropped from 215 to 311 during a traumatic year
which culminated in the sacking of the chief executive, resignation of the
finance director, and second profits warning in two years. The group
registered the FT500's fifth-worst fall last year. Meanwhile, Zeneca, ICI's
former bioscience business, entered the FT500 at 52.
In 1992, the chemicals industry performed better than the drugs sector as
investors switched into cyclical stocks. But last year, the recession in
Germany and France undermined their standings.
The German groups suffered particularly. Hoechst fell from 45 to 55 as its
profits plunged during the first nine months by 40 per cent and its chairman
hinted of another dividend cut.
BASF also dropped from 56 to 63, as its pre-tax earnings during the first
nine months fell 44 per cent and it also warned of another dividend cut.
DSM, the Dutch petrochemicals group, was one of the FT500's biggest fallers,
down from 218 to 395, reflecting the dire state of Europe's plastics
industry.
ICI fell from 28 to 71, but the apparent collapse was due more to the
company's split into two separate groups than any particular problems at the
British chemical concern. Rhone-Poulenc of France entered the FT500 at 79
after its privatisation by the French government last year. Laporte was one
of the few climbers in the sector, up from 306 to 284 following its
acquisition of Evode.
The industrial gases businesses which had proved a haven from the recession
fared less well in 1993. L'Air Liquide fell from 52 to 72, BOC dropped from
80 to 128, and AGA slumped from 203 to 225.

FT  20 JAN 94 / The FT500 (28): The build-up to recovery begins - Companies
have had a poor year. But there are signs of improvement / Sector Analyses -
Construction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR

<TEXT>
It has been a horrid year for most European construction companies. Profits
have tumbled. Domestic building and civil engineering markets have shrunk
and large numbers of construction workers have been laid off as companies
have closed or reduced capacity.
The only consolation has been found in stock markets where share prices,
particularly of British contractors and building material suppliers, have
risen sharply, indicating that investors believe that bottom may be
approaching and that, at least in the UK, recovery may be round the corner.
The reason for this resurgence in shareholder optimism has been the
continuing low levels of European and US interest rates.
This is perceived to have two beneficial effects. The first and most
important of these is to reduce the cost of borrowing to finance new
construction of factories, homes and offices. Secondly, lower interest rates
encourage greater investment in equities, including construction shares, by
reducing returns available on cash deposits.
A slow recovery in US construction markets, together with the indications
that a similar thaw may at last be getting under way in the UK, has further
assisted investment sentiment in companies with exposure to these markets.
As a result, the rankings of the 29 construction and building material
companies included in the latest FT European 500 generally enjoyed a modest
improvement in 1993, in spite of publishing some very poor profits figures.
Of the 17 companies to increase their rating - including three new entries -
nine were British and a tenth, CRH, was Irish.
The improvement in the ranking of continental European companies Lafarge
Coppee and Holderbank, the French and Swiss cement companies, has more to do
with their large US interests than any strength in continental markets which
generally struggled in 1993.
Lafarge Coppee, the second largest construction company by market
capitalisation in the FT European 500, rose from 153rd to 131st in the
overall table. Holderbank rose from 241st to 183rd.
Saint Gobain, the French glass maker with the largest market capitalisation
in the sector, saw its overall rating fall 20 places to 81st position.
The company suffered because of its exposure to the declining French
construction market which has been hit harder than most as the recession has
moved to the European mainland.
EuroConstruct, representing construction research agencies and economic
forecasting bodies in 15 European countries, estimates that the volume of
construction output, measured in constant prices, fell by about 3 per cent
in western Europe last year.
It forecasts a further fall of 0.3 per cent this year with further declines
in output expected in Belgium, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden and
Finland.
UK construction output, by contrast, is forecast to rise by just 0.9 per
cent, having fallen by 14 per cent in the previous three years.
Growth rates in Germany have slowed considerably with continuing strong
demand for more and better housing in eastern Germany offset by reduced
investment in the west as the national economy has come under increased
pressure. Output is forecast by EuroConstruct to rise by just 1.5 per cent
in 1994.
No German construction company improved its FT 500 rating last year, with
four out of the five companies reducing their ranking. Hochtief, the best
performer, only just maintained its place in 150th position.
Three new construction-related companies joined the 500. These were Lapeyre,
the French joinery group, which was floated last year; Dragados, the Spanish
contractor and Wimpey of the UK.
The British contractor crept into 494th position in spite of announcing a
Dollars 171.4m loss for 1992, the worst result in its 100-year history.
Wimpey has since moved back into the black, making a pre-tax profit of
Dollars 1.6m in the first half of last year. Net debt as a proportion of
shareholders' funds fell to 36 per cent at the end of June following the
group's Dollars 155m rights issue.
UK housebuilders raised Dollars 701m from rights issues last year, including
Dollars 321m from Tarmac. The money was needed to repair balance sheets and
provide cash to buy land to take advantage of the fragile UK housing
recovery which got under way last year.
British building material companies such as Redland, Blue Circle, RMC, BPB
Industries and Pilkington have also benefited from a resurgence in British
building material prices as markets for their products have improved and
manufacturing capacity of cement, bricks and structural steel has reduced in
the recession.
However, some British stock market analysts believe that the rise in share
prices of UK construction and building materials companies may be coming to
an end since the modest rate of recovery predicted for the industry does not
justify the rating that some of these companies are now on.
Annual pre-tax profits published last year for the 29 contractors and
building material companies in the FT500 fell by 27.7 per cent to Dollars
3.13bn with British companies among the worst affected, reflecting the depth
of the property recession during 1992. The 29 accounted for 1.96 per cent of
the total published profits of FT500 companies compared with 2.47 per cent
the previous year.

FT  20 JAN 94 / The FT500 (27): Revived fortunes lure investors - European
insurance company shares rose by 57 per cent in the 12 months to November
1993, outperforming the FT Actuaries Europe index by 13.2 per cent / A look
at the sector / Sector Analyses - Insurance

Attracted by the prospect of improved trading prospects and sharp increases
in the value of insurers' investment portfolios, the markets favoured the
European insurance sector last year, leading to increases in the
capitalisation of the continent's largest companies. Nine of the leading 10
companies edged their way up the FT500 rankings.
During 1992, profits at a number of Europe's biggest general insurance
companies were dented by rising claims in motor and property insurance and a
fall in capital gains. Last year, though, insurers pushed through rate
increases, and investors responded positively to indications of an upturn in
the traditional insurance cycle.
The markets were also lured towards the sector by trends in the equity and
bond markets. Insurance companies, especially in Germany, Switzerland,
France and Italy, benefited from the trend towards lower interest rates
which increased the value of their bond portfolios.
Figures produced by Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the UK securities house, show
that European insurance company shares rose by 57 per cent in the 12 months
to November 1993, outperforming the FT Actuaries Europe index by 13.2 per
cent.
Reflecting the particularly strong performance of the German markets during
the year, Germany's largest insurers all did well. Allianz Holdings,
Europe's biggest insurer, increased its standing from 7th to 4th. Munich Re,
the biggest reinsurer, moved up 10 places to 27. AMB Aachener &amp; Muenchener -
the German insurer whose share price almost doubled in 1993 - improved its
ranking from 201 to 154, while Allianz Lebensversicherungs, listed
separately from its Munich-based parent, also moved up the table by 24
places to 96.
Italy's biggest companies also figure prominently in the listings, again
reflecting a combination of a strong performance of the local stock market
and expectation of future profits following premium increases. Generali, the
Trieste-based company - and Europe's second largest - improved its ranking
from 23 to 20, while its Alleanza life insurance subsidiary, move up 43
places to 90. Alleanza's position was also strengthened by a mid-year
capital raising exercise. Fondiaria, the Florence-based company which left
the 500 last year following a poor performance of its share price,
re-entered at number 270 (with a capitalisation of Dollars 2,022.8m) while
SAI and RAS both improved their standings from number 282 to 163 and from
417 to 309.
Scandinavian companies saw the value of their shares plummet during 1992,
largely as a result of confusion surrounding efforts by Uni Storebrand and
Hafnia to take over Skandia, the region's biggest insurer. Following the
failure of those efforts and a marked improvement in local trading
conditions, Skandia's share price has recovered. It is now the 372nd largest
European company with a capitalisation of Dollars 1,438m.
Trygg-Hansa SPP Holding of Sweden, and Baltica of Denmark, two other leading
Scandinavian insurers caught amid the market turmoil in 1992, have also
re-entered the 500, Trygg standing at 381 with capitalisation of Dollars
1,409.7m and Baltica with capitalisation of Dollars 999.9, standing at 477.
France's two largest companies also show up well, with part of the
improvement here reflecting the impact of the biggest cross-border deals in
the sector during the year, in which both Assurances Gejnerales de France
(AGF) and Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP) strengthened their position in
the German market. During 1993, AGF issued more than 10m new shares as part
of an exercise to raise capital to increase its stake in AMB from 25.1 per
cent to 33.5 per cent. The issues will increase capitalisation by about
Fr6.4bn.
UAP also raised about Fr1.3bn in fresh capital as part of its moves to
secure control of Colonia, Germany's second biggest insurance company, from
the Suez Group.
(The listings only partially reflect the impact of these moves, since only
part of the AGF capital increase and all the UAP increase are included in
the September 30 capitalisation figures on which the tables are based. UAP
moved up from 69 to 58, while AGF rose from 110 to 80).
British insurance companies sustained record losses during 1990 and 1991,
when they were hit by a combination of weather losses and recession. During
1992 there was a recovery in their fortunes, with rate increases helping two
companies - Commercial Union and Guardian Royal Exchange - into profit, and
reducing losses at Sun Alliance, Royal Insurance and General Accident.
The recovery continued in 1993, when each of the five companies was expected
to be back in the black. Two companies - Royal Insurance and Commercial
Union - repaired their balance sheets with rights issues.
Royal raised Pounds 404m in a deeply discounted rights issue in May, while
CU raised Pounds 428m in February. Both companies' capitalisation increased,
with Royal Insurance moving up the rankings from 303 to 189.
Other leading insurers to edge upwards include Swiss Re (up six places to
102), which, like its rival reinsurer Munich Re, has benefited from
particularly attractive trading conditions in international reinsurance
markets.
A string of catastrophe losses, including hurricane Andrew, the United
States' most expensive natural disaster in August 1992, has depleted the
reserves of the reinsurance industry, leading to increases in rates of up to
400 per cent.

FT  20 JAN 94 / The FT500 (26): Exit from ERM spurs success - A sector that
last year did particularly well, especially in the United Kingdom and
Switzerland / Sector Analyses - Banking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER

<TEXT>
It may not have been much of a year in many industries but the FT500 shows
how good it was for banks. The precipitous rise in share prices of Swiss and
UK banks propelled them sharply up the rankings, while British investment
banks rose even faster on the back of near-perfect trading conditions.
The banks' success was a bad advertisement for the European Union. Not only
did the market capitalisation of UK banks rise following Britain's exit from
the exchange rate mechanism, but the universal banks that trade in foreign
exchange gained from currency turmoil amid speculation against the ERM.
The newest European bank also emerged as the most valuable. HSBC Holdings,
the bank holding company formed by Hongkong and Shanghai Bank to coincide
with its takeover of Midland Bank, rose to eighth place. Its roots in the
booming Asia Pacific market made it the 23rd most profitable company.
The big three Swiss banks consolidated their position in the sector. They
were no longer held back by their very strong capital and weak profits from
domestic retail banking. Instead, their strength helped their securities
trading, and attracted risk management business from derivatives.
This gave each of the big three a big push up the rankings. Union Bank of
Switzerland rose 10 places to 15th, and Swiss Bank Corporation rose to 38th
from 62nd. CS Holding rose to 36th from 68th after taking over Swiss
Volksbank, which left the FT500 from its 494th ranking last year.
Yet the success of UK banks showed it was not necessary to have impressive
earnings to rise in value. British banks such as Barclays and National
Westminster rose because of future promise rather than achievement. Shares
rose as investors discounted recovery several years into the future.
Barclays was the best example of the emergence of UK banks as recovery
stocks after the bad debt problems of the 1980s. Although it had the dubious
achievement of being the third least profitable company by losing Dollars
369.1m, it rose 13 places to 31st place measured by market capitalisation.
Other UK banks which rose significantly in the rankings because of the
rerating of UK bank shares on expectations of recovery included Royal Bank
of Scotland, up from 216th place to 144th, and TSB Group, up to 112th place
from 145th after returning to profitability.
The sharpest rise in the rankings by a British bank came from another bank
with roots in the Asia Pacific. Standard Chartered, which for years has been
seen as an accident-prone and inadequately managed bank, rose 94 places to
165th place on the back of a startling share performance.
The other commercial banking market which achieved a good result was Spain.
Spanish retail banks were helped by high net interest margins, and recovery
from bad debt. The two highest ranked were Banco Bilbao Vizcaya which rose
from 98th to 92nd, and Banco de Santander, which rose 24 places to 101st.
Ironically, the sharpest Spanish rise came from Banesto, a retail banking
recovery story that went wrong. Its share price rise after JP Morgan, the US
bank, masterminded a capital restructuring, pushed it from 243rd to 184th
place. Nevertheless, excessive loan growth forced the Bank of Spain to
rescue Banesto late last year. Meanwhile, Banco Popular, the most profitable
Spanish bank, moved up gently from 183rd to 160th.
German banks fell in the rankings, in spite of the strength of the D-Mark,
on emerging problems of loan provisions in the deteriorating economy.
Deutsche Bank dropped from 10th to 12th place, Bayerische Vereinsbank from
90th to 94th, and Commerzbank from 99th to 105th.
The strongest individual performance by a bank came from Svenska
Handelsbanken, the only leading bank in Sweden, Norway and Finland which did
not need state assistance to escape the banking crisis. Its sharp turnaround
into profit catapulted it 243 places up the rankings to 223rd.
However, the boost in fortunes for financial services firms was not confined
to banks. The exceptional trading conditions for bonds and equities, and the
sharp rise in European and Asian stock markets helped both investment banks
and their asset management arms to rise briskly in the FT500.
One of the newest entries to the FTSE-100 index also rose sharply in the
FT500. Schroders, the UK investment bank, was among the biggest gainers this
year, rising 101 places to 228 on strong profits. The achievement reflected
a wider rerating of merchant and investment banking shares in the UK.
Another strong gain came from SG Warburg, the UK investment bank, which rose
36 places to 220th as its shares gained from pan-European strength. Warburg
was pushed up by the rise of Mercury Asset Management, the fund manager of
which it owns 75 per cent, to 296th place (up 125).
Among investment banks which entered the FT 500 amid strong trading
conditions were Hambros, the UK investment bank, and Baer Holdings, the
Swiss private bank and fund management company. A question for next year
will be whether they can sustain their position despite earnings volatility.
However, in spite of doubts over whether next year can be as good for banks,
it is clear that 1993 proved an exceptional year in at least some European
markets. Whether the recovery will be matched in other markets as asset
quality problems subside will be seen in next year's index.

FT  20 JAN 94 / The FT500 (24): Mergers help give a lift to the Dutch -
While most Belgian companies have slipped this year, corporate life in the
Netherlands has improved / Country Analyses - Benelux Countries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL and RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The diverging fortunes of Belgian and Dutch corporate life are obvious from
the FT500.
Of the 18 Belgian companies in the 500, only two - Bekaert, the steel and
wire cord group, and Kredietbank, one of the big three Belgian banks - have
improved their ranking since last year, and that only marginally. Three
Belgian companies are among the 25 companies to fall the furthest, and two
more have left the list altogether.
By contrast, leaving aside the largest Anglo-Dutch companies, the Dutch list
includes two new entries and three more companies which have shown strong
improvements in their position.
That partly reflects the influence of recent mergers on the Dutch business
world. The two new entries, Bols Wessanen, the food-to-beverages group
ranked 298th, and KNP BT, the paper and packaging company which is listed in
365th place, are the products of far-reaching domestic tie-ups concluded in
the course of 1993.
These latest mergers confirm a trend that has been apparent since the early
1990s. For all the excitement about the single market and the need for
cross-border expansion, Dutch companies have tended to look for merger
partners in their own backyard first, partly as a means of defence and
partly as a way of increasing their scope for international acquisitions.
The two highest-ranked Dutch companies in the FT 500 listing -
Internationale Nederlanden Group (ING), the financial services group, and
ABN Amro, the Netherlands' largest bank - did not even exist before 1990.
Both were created in that year as part of the swiftest consolidation to
sweep Dutch finance since the 1960s.
Having secured their domestic base, both ING and ABN Amro are looking
intently for acquisitions in Europe. So far, however, their European
ambitions have been hampered by the high price commanded by the region's
banks and insurers.
ING's climb to 49th place from 60th in 1992 is a reflection of the re-rating
of the company's shares. When it was first created in 1990, Europe's first
full-fledged 'bancassurance' company, spanning both insurance and banking,
caused confusion among investors who did not know whether to value the group
as a bank or an insurance company. As a result, ING's shares tended to
underperform the Netherlands' financial sector.
In 1993, however, ING's shares put in a strong performance, rising from
around Fl 52 (Dollars 27) in mid-December 1992 to around Fl 90 in December
1993.
Another big beneficiary of share-price gains is Philips, the electronics
group, which rose to 86th from 101th place, due mainly to a doubling in its
share price over the 12 months to December. This, in turn, was caused by
enthusiasm for the company's renewed efforts to sell off unprofitable assets
rather than any significant recovery in its underlying business, which
remains hampered by the worldwide malaise in consumer electronics.
The Belgian stock market has reached record levels in 1993, but the problem
is that it has still underperformed most other European exchanges. As a
result, most Belgian stocks have slipped down the list.
Ironically, they include companies in the banking and retailing sector which
seemed to represent particularly strong defensive investments a year ago.
With the exception of Kredietbank, Belgium's big banks - Generale de Banque
and Banque Bruxelles Lambert - have both lost ground. BBL, in particular,
has had to work hard in 1993 to recover from provisions against bad loans,
recorded in 1992's profits, and the break-up of 1992 talks with ING, the
Dutch financial services group, over a possible merger.
Indeed, over the past two years, there has been a dearth of large takeovers
in Belgium. As a result, the stock market has been prey to unsustained
speculative surges, based on rumours of restructuring by the country's main
holding companies.
During 1993, perhaps the most exciting deal was the September sale of a 43
per cent stake in CBR, the cement company ranked 361st in the FT500, by
Societe Generale de Belgique, the holding company ranked 127th, to
Heidelberger Zement, Germany's largest producer of building materials.
Fortis, the Dutch-Belgian financial services group (ranked 116), also
completed an important deal when it bought 50 per cent of CGER-ASLK, a
network of Belgian savings banks, in the first stage of the Belgian
government's privatisation programme.
In retailing, the change against 1992 has been even more dramatic than in
the banking sector. GIB Group slipped from 300th to 437th, while Delhaize -
which was one of the top 200 in 1992 - declined from 176th to 327th. Along
with Cobepa, the small Belgian holding company, both companies make the list
of the 25 European companies to fall furthest during 1993.
Delhaize has had a particularly tough year. In the first half, its
consolidated net profits fell by more than 70 per cent. It has been hit by
recession, falling food prices and industrial disputes in Belgium; and by a
wave of bad publicity in the US, which caused a drop in business and a slump
in the share price. Delhaize has blamed a concerted smear campaign by
disgruntled US unions.
If there is one success story in the Belgian list, it is probably Bekaert.
The wire and steel cord manufacturer edged up from 435th to 432nd in the
FT500, which does not seem spectacular. However, Bekaert also achieved the
third largest profit increase among European companies. That represented a
recovery from losses in 1991, and the just reward for some sensible
restructuring, achieved in spite of the recession.

FT  20 JAN 94 / The FT500 (25): Edging towards a place in the top 500 -
Already the Czech republic has two companies ripe for inclusion among
Europe's giants. Meanwhile, mass privatisation should take off in Poland
this year / Country Analyses - Eastern Europe

A combination of privatisation on an unprecedented scale and the stock
market surges which spread from Warsaw to Prague and Budapest in the second
half of last year has brought to the fore a growing number of private
central European companies ripe for inclusion in the FT500.
Already the Czech republic boasts two companies whose market capitalisation
at the end of the year exceeded that of the Dollars 921m recorded by the
Finnish company at the bottom of the FT500. What is more, the Dollars 2.7bn
capitalisation of CEZ, the electrical utility company which heads the Czech
list, equals the total year-end market capitalisation of the 22 stocks
quoted on the Warsaw stock exchange. Total Polish capitalisation reached
Dollars 2.7bn after a hectic year in which Polish-quoted share prices rose
on average by 700 per cent.
Both Prague and Warsaw outclassed the Budapest stock exchange where the
market capitalisation of the 28 quoted shares ended the year at Dollars 820m
after a late rally which boosted the Budapest index by 50 per cent over the
last few weeks but still left shares languishing in real terms below their
values of two years ago.
Pre-war Czechoslovakia boasted one of the most developed industrial
economies in the world. It lost competitiveness and was diverted into
inappropriate energy and raw material consuming heavy industry under Soviet
domination. But the innate strengths of the Czech economy and the underlying
resources of a skilled labour force are once again coming to the surface
under the single-mindedly pro-market and pro-privatisation policies of the
government led by Mr Vaclav Klaus.
The Czechs pioneered mass privatisation, with more than 1,300 enterprises
privatised in the first round of privatisation through vouchers and over 800
enterprises about to be privatised under the second round.
More than 70 per cent of the 8m Czech citizens who paid around Dollars 30
for vouchers permitting them to buy shares in the 1,300 companies with a
book value vastly in excess of the vouchers, deposited them with the private
investment funds which sprang up to manage the deluge of new shares and new
shareholders.
In effect most voucher holders have become shareholders in the funds who
actually manage the shares, buying and selling on and off the stock exchange
and building up controlling packets of shares where possible.
A glance at the top six shares quoted on the Prague stock exchange is
instructive. After CEZ comes Ceska Sporitelna, the Czech savings bank,
capitalised at Dollars 1.06bn, which is followed by the biggest commercial
bank, Komercni Banka at Dollars 900m. The Czech banks are all in the throes
of bad-debt write-offs and capital re-financing to fit them for their future
role as financiers of the emerging small and medium private business sector.
The two biggest quoted companies after CEZ and the banks are both
majority-controlled by foreign investors. Tabak, the former state tobacco
monopoly bought by Philip Morris, is capitalised at Dollars 695m while
Cokoladovny, controlled by Nestle, pitches in at Dollars 648m. Way behind in
sixth place comes the country's largest engineering group, Skoda Pilzen,
which is capitalised at Dollars 320m. Skoda Automobilovna, the motor car
company which is the largest and probably best known Czech company, is in
the throes of becoming controlled 70 per cent by Volkswagen, with the state
retaining the remaining shares, so it is not a quoted company.
The relatively slow, case by case, privatisation approach decided on by the
Hungarian authorities, with the emphasis on trade sales to foreign
investors, has paid off to the extent that Hungary has attracted the bulk of
the more than Dollars 5.5bn invested in central and eastern Europe over the
past three years. But the reluctance to embrace mass privatisation is
reflected in the relative smallness of the Budapest stock exchange with only
28 shares quoted, of which the most sought after are those of Fotex, the
photographic and luxury goods company. Last year, turnover in shares at
18.26bn forints was only 10 per cent of total stock exchange turnover which
was dominated by trading in government bonds and treasury bills.
In Poland the biggest company by market capitalisation is Wedel, the
chocolatemaker now controlled by Pepsico as part of its ambitious foray, in
competition with Coca Cola, into the biggest market of the region. Poland
has 39m people compared to just over 10m each in Hungary and the Czech
republic, 5m in Slovakia and under 2m in Slovenia whose own fledgling stock
exchange is tipped to come alive in 1994 as the well-run economy picks up.
Wedel, capitalised at Dollars 304m as of end-September, is followed on the
Warsaw stock exchange, housed in the former offices of the Communist party
central committee building, by Elektrim, the former state power and
telecommunications equipment trading company at Dollars 214m. Fast expanding
Elektrim is among several quoted companies planning to tap the market this
year by raising fresh equity, in Elektrim's case by partially floating off
several of its subsidiary companies.
Mass privatisation should take off in Poland this year as the new left of
centre government carries on the previous government's plan to privatise up
to 500 state-controlled enterprises and create 20-30 so-called 'National
Investment Funds' with foreign and Polish managers to perform the vital
functions of modernising, slimming down, restructuring and eventually
re-financing their companies.
This process is expected to greatly expand the stock exchange listings over
the rest of this decade. The new government is so keen to raise revenue by
successful privatisation that it appears unlikely to impose new taxes on
capital gains or tax share transactions as demanded by some of its more
orthodox left-wing supporters.
The recent successful stock market debut of the first two privatised banks,
the Wielkopolski and Slaski banks, has already expanded the number of
shareholders in Poland to more than 200,000, and last year's boom has
whetted the appetite of many more potential investors in a country where
real incomes, and savings, are rising after 4 per cent GDP growth last year.

FT  20 JAN 94 / The FT500 (23): Devaluation helps Swedes and Finns -
Recession continued to dog the region but stock markets rose sharply as
interest rates fell and signs of recovery began to show / Country Analyses -

After a dismal, recession-driven slump in the rankings in 1992, Nordic
companies have rebounded significantly this year.
Ten new Nordic entries - or re-entries - outweighed five departures (two of
which were due to takeovers), compared with a net loss last year of 11. The
turnaround took the total of Swedish, Danish, Finnish and Norwegian
companies in the list to 45.
Nordic companies also made their presence felt among the more eye-catching
performers. Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, Sweden's leading commercial bank,
vaulted back from a loss-driven share collapse to re-enter the top 500 at
number 199. Its rival Svenska Handelsbanken topped the list of big risers
among established FT500 companies by surging from 465th place to 223rd.
Astra, the Swedish pharmaceutical group, held its 1992 ranking of 32, the
highest of any Nordic company. It also ranked as Europe's seventh most
profitable company, with a 49.8 per cent return on capital.
Another prominent Nordic re-entry to the FT500 was Nokia, the Finnish
telecommunications group, which is riding a tide of growth in its mobile
telephone division. It came in at number 301. Meanwhile, Norsk Hydro, the
petroleum and fertiliser group that is Norway's biggest stock-listed
company, registered Europe's biggest increase in profits, showing a rise of
no less than 7,715 per cent.
Recession continued to dog the Nordic region in 1993 - especially in Sweden
and Finland. But stock markets in the four countries rose sharply as
interest rates fell and signs of recovery began to show in the latter part
of the year. In Sweden and Finland, companies also benefited greatly from
the big devaluations in the Swedish krona and Finnish markka over the year,
which boosted profitability.
Finland's representation in the FT500 was quadrupled to eight from 1992,
reflecting a near doubling of values on the Helsinki stock exchange over the
year.
The top Finnish company, forestry and engineering group Repola, improved
from 387th place to 255th. Finnish newcomers, apart from Nokia, were
forestry groups Enso-Gutzeit and Metsa-Serla, respectively at 387 and 471;
Outokumpu, the mining company, at 482; and the banks Unitas and
Kansallis-Osake-Pankki. Unitas came in at 440, while KOP edges in at 500.
Six of Denmark's 10 FT500 companies also improved their positions. The main
reverse was Carlsberg, the brewer, which was toppled from Danish top spot as
it slid from 158th place overall to 229th. It was overtaken by AP Moller,
the shipping group, whose joint parent companies, D/S Svendborg and D/S af
1912, moved up to 148 and 149 on the overall list respectively.
Closer inspection of the rankings, however, reveals that stock market
performance tended to be well ahead of bottom-line performance. Eleven of
the 25 European companies showing the biggest swings from profit to loss
were Swedish, Finnish or Danish.
Prominent among these were banks and insurance companies. Most of the
region's financial stocks rebounded strongly in 1993, as banks and insurance
groups took the first steps back to health after crippling loan losses in
1992. But they are still carrying the burden of those losses: Unitas
suffered Europe's 12th biggest swing to loss from profit  - Dollars 445.5m.
Others in the list of crashing profits were Swedish insurers Trygg-Hansa SPP
and Skandia, S-E Banken, Den Danske Bank and Unidanmark.
Traditional Swedish industrial powerhouses also put up a mixed showing, at
best. Three Swedish industrial departures from the FT500 - Trelleborg, the
troubled mining and metals group; Industrivarden, a mixed investment group;
and Korsnas, a pulp and paper company taken over by Kinnevik - balanced new
financial sector entries S-E Banken, Skandia and Trygg-Hansa SPP, to leave
Sweden's total representation at 21. Of these, only seven improved their
rankings.
Volvo's tumultuous year - which swung from heavy losses and an agreement to
merge with France's Renault, to resurgent profits and the controversial
breaking of the merger deal - left it down slightly in the rankings, from
129th place to 136th.

FT  20 JAN 94 / The FT500 (22): Privatisation spurs equities market - The
improvement in the country's position in the FT500 this year is explained by
a combination of a substantial rise in share prices and some large capital
increases / Country Analyses - Italy

One of the FT500's second division countries, Italy did better in 1993. The
list shows a net gain of two Italian companies to a total of 25, with six
arrivals against four departures. And of the 19 listed in 1992, 16 moved
upwards in the new table. Indeed, three leapt more than 100 places.
The improvement in the Italian position is explained by a combination of a
substantial rise in share prices and some large capital increases. These
more than compensated for the lira's steep depreciation against the dollar,
in which company capitalisation is measured, from about L1,300 at the
beginning of October 1992 to almost L1,600 at the end of September 1993.
Share price indices show that it was, overall, a good year to be invested in
Italian equities. When the market closed on September 30 1993, the Comit
general index (1972 base=100) stood at 596, compared with 364 a year before.
While the rise of 63.7 per cent left the index considerably short of the 908
high reached in May 1986, it regained all the ground lost between the
beginning of October 1991, when it stood at 539, and the end of September
1992.
A substantial part of the price recovery occurred during autumn 1992, with
the Comit general index rising 22.5 per cent in the final quarter to 446.
However, the improvement continued strongly in the first nine months of
1993, with the index gaining 33.6 per cent. The MIB general index, which is
reset to 1,000 at the beginning of each year, stood at 1,310 on 30 September
1993.
Why have Italian stocks excelled? In common with other equity markets, Italy
has benefited from the sharp drop in interest rates that has led savers to
seek alternatives to bank deposits and government securities.
While inflation stood at just over 5 per cent in September 1992, the average
interest rate on treasury bills was nearly 18 per cent, and certificates of
deposit were yielding around 12 per cent. Real returns have plummeted. In
the 12 months to September 1993, rates on treasury bills plunged to just
over 9 per cent, and rates on certificates of deposit fell to 8 per cent,
while inflation was less than one percentage point lower at a little over 4
per cent.
Attilio Ventura, chairman of the Italian Stock Exchange Council, noted the
change in savings patterns when he addressed the Federation of European
Stock Exchanges at the end of October. 'In the past few months, record
amounts of money have flowed into mutual funds. Purchases of Italian shares
by these funds have increased from L100bn in the last quarter of 1992 to
L700bn in the quarter just ended in September.'
Trading volumes and values have reflected the increased interest in
equities. In August, September and October 1992, the average daily values of
transactions on the Italian stock market were L111bn, L90bn and L156bn
respectively. The average daily value in the first nine months of 1993 was
L390bn, with high points of L455bn and L574bn in August and September.
The Italian government's privatisation programme has helped stimulate the
equities market. The start was made with the Amato government's
announcement, in September 1992, that Credito Italiano (the retail bank
controlled by the IRI state holding corporation) and Nuovo Pignone (the
mechanical engineering company owned by the ENI state hydrocarbons holding)
were to be sold.
Privatisation progress has sometimes faltered. But the recent successful
public offer of Credito Italiano shares, the sale of two divisions of IRI's
stock market-quoted SME food and retailing group, and the imminent public
offers of shares in Banca Commerciale Italiana, the Treasury-controlled IMI
financial conglomerate and insurer INA suggest that substantial
privatisation will be a reality.
The price of Credito Italiano's shares rose sharply when the bank's
privatisation was announced, moving from L1,743 to L3,160 during the last
quarter of 1992. It subsequently slipped back, but was nevertheless nearly
52 per cent higher at L2,643 on September 30 1993 than it had been 12 months
before. The price of Banca Commerciale Italiana's shares rose 71.2 per cent
from L2,838 to L4,858 in the year to September 30 1993, an improvement that
lifted it to 219th place in the FT500, from 250th in 1992.
Even more impressive was the performance of shares in IRI-controlled
telecommunications companies, with the prices of Sip and Stet increasing
more than 300 per cent to L3,677 and L4,405 respectively. It is not
surprising that these two stocks moved firmly up, the former from 149 to 43
(to be ranked the second Italian) and the latter from 136 to 65. Sip and
Stet have been among the most active, together accounting for around 11 per
cent of total trading value in the year to September 30.
According to Mr Ventura, 'the vast privatisation programme introduced by the
government will have a triple effect: an increase in the number of Italian
shareholders, an increase in the number of companies listed on the exchange
and an increase in the float of state-owned companies already listed.'
One-third of industrial activity and two-thirds of the banking and financial
sectors are controlled directly or indirectly by the state, and state-owned
companies account for over a third of the market capitalisation of the
Italian stock exchange.
But private-sector stocks have not been forgotten. Shareholders in Fiat,
whose ordinary shares account for about 9 per cent of total trading, saw the
share price bounce back from L3,460 on September 30 1992 to L5,648 one year
later. There was also a small improvement in Fiat's FT500 ranking, from 94
to 85.
Fiat's Toro insurance subsidiary performed well, improving 70 places in the
list from 429 to 359. The other Italian insurers in the FT500 also earned
higher rankings. Generali remained the top Italian company, in 20th place,
having been ranked 23rd in 1992. (Shareholders saw the price rise from just
over L20,000 to nearly L40,000 during the year.)
Alleanza, RAS and SAI won higher places, while Fondiaria entered the
rankings at 270. State-owned Assitalia, whose shares were subject to a
purchase offer at the end of 1993 prior to the privatisation of its INA
parent, crept into the rankings at 499.
Having slipped ignominiously from the FT500 in 1992, Olivetti makes a
reappearance in 363rd place for 1993. However, although shareholders have
seen the share price move upwards, it has underperformed against the
indices, and they were asked to subscribe to a substantial capital increase
during the year, while seeing losses worsen.

FT  20 JAN 94 / The FT500 (21): The tables have now turned - Large companies
have just ended another year of slack domestic demand. Consumer confidence
was depressed by high real interest rates and fears of rising unemployment /

Almost all the winners among the French contenders in last year's version of
the FT500 were from manufacturing and most of the losers were from finance.
This year, the tables have turned. France's financial groups, notably Union
des Assurances de Paris (UAP), Axa and Assurances Generales de France (AGF)
in insurance, succeeded in improving their standing in the FT500 during
1993, having slipped down the index in the previous year. Several of the
earlier manufacturing winners, such as L'Oreal in cosmetics and BSN in food,
lost ground last year.
The performance of the French corporate sector was scarcely scintillating in
1993. Elf Aquitaine, the oil group which is not only the biggest single
company in France but the next candidate for sale in the Balladur
government's privatisation drive, slipped from 16th to 17th place. Even
successful stocks, such as the insurers, saw their shares rise not on a
strong performance in 1993 but in anticipation of recovery in 1994 and 1995.
The companies quoted on the CAC 40 Index have just ended their fourth
successive year of earnings decline, as illustrated by the recent round of
profits warnings and gloomy corporate statements that have emanated from the
shareholders' meetings of the large French groups. Mr David Harrington,
French market analyst at James Capel in Paris, estimates that the CAC 40
companies suffered a 25 per cent reduction in net earnings during 1993.
The reasons for this pedestrian performance are all too obvious. The
Balladur government has, like its socialist predecessor, persistently
resisted the temptation to regenerate the economy by accelerating interest
rate reduction in favour of pursuing its franc fort policy of protecting the
French currency.
As a result, the economy slipped into recession during the first quarter of
1993 and remained stubbornly sluggish for the rest of the year. France's
large companies have just ended yet another year of slack domestic demand as
consumer confidence was depressed by the impact of high real interest rates
and fears of rising unemployment.
Companies in the consumer products sector slipped down the FT500 partly
because of concern about the strength of the domestic market. BSN, the food
group, tumbled from 30 to 53 in a year in which the retail market became so
competitive that it was forced to cut the prices of some products to
maintain market share.
Media groups also lost ground. Havas, which has extensive interests in
advertising and publishing, fell from 128 to 153 on concern about the
condition of the French advertising market and the impact of the recession
on its travel business. Canal-Plus, the pay-TV group which was once a star
of the stock market, was hit by fears about the impact of the Balladur
government's forthcoming media reforms, culminating in its recent profits
warning for 1994. It fell from 102 to 129.
Other French companies were affected by concern about their international
interests. Despite their domestic difficulties, the French continued to fare
well on the foreign front until early 1993 when the impact of the franc's
strength following the European currency crisis in autumn 1992 became a
significant handicap to international competitiveness.
The strong franc not only depressed the reported profits from foreign
subsidiaries, but also made it more difficult for French businesses to
compete in their export markets. A number of the most prominent losers among
the manufacturers in last year's FT500 are companies that had, in the past,
fared well on the export front.
LVMH, the luxury goods group with interests across the drinks and fashion
industries, has been badly affected by the problems of the global champagne
market, the instability of the Japanese economy and the difficulties of
Guinness, its UK associate. It fell from 31 to 51 in the FT500 during 1993
after reporting reduced interim profits and warning of a further fall in
earnings for the full financial year.
Peugeot-Citroen, the motor company, was dogged by concern about the
fragilility of the European car market. It slipped from 84 to 100 during a
grim year in which it plunged into the red during the interim period.
Peugeot said that, without the negative swing in exchange rates, it would
have stayed in the black in the first half.
But its problems pale beside those of Euro Disney, the leisure group that
dived down the FT500 from 184 to 307 as speculation mounted about the
prospects for its emergency financial rescue plan. Euro Disney, which
reported a net loss of FFr5.3bn for the year to September 30, looks like a
microcosm of all the problems of the French corporate scene with the
recession reducing the expenditure of its French customers and the strong
franc making it more difficult to drum up business from other countries.
Yet some French groups did succeed in shrugging off the gloom of 1993.
Retailing was one of the year's stronger sectors despite the strains on
consumer spending and the poor results of a number of big companies.
Carrefour, the hypermarket chain, and Promodes, the mail order concern, both
managed to move up the FT500.
Similarly, the large insurers fared well in the face of lacklustre results.
UAP edged up to 58 in anticipation of its forthcoming privatisation. Its
shares were bolstered by a modest improvement in its 1993 results and the
expectation of further progress next year. Axa and AGF also rose in the
index - from 95 to 68 and from 110 to 80 respectively - on recovery hopes.
Investors clearly consider the worst is over, not only for the large French
insurers, but the rest of the corporate sector. The economy is still in a
fragile state - and its prospects for recovery will be complicated by the
condition of trading partners such as Germany - but analysts do expect to
see some improvement this year.
James Capel has pencilled in increases in CAC 40 net earnings of 28 per cent
for 1994 and 29 per cent for 1995, thereby marking the end of four years of
decline.

FT  20 JAN 94 / The FT500 (19): No easy ride for Britain's top companies -
Attention has focused on banks, property shares and electricity suppliers.
Among the large losers have been the growth stocks of yore / Country
Analyses - United Kingdom

<TEXT>
Britain's top companies might have felt entitled to an easier ride in 1993
after the traumas of the election and the enforced departure from the ERM in
1992. In the event, the recovery has been patchy and many companies have
found it hard to push up their margins. The biggest surprise has been the
failure of inflation to take off after the devaluation. Only gradually has
the City come to accept that it may remain muted for some time to come.
The stock market, meanwhile, has been travelling hopefully, discounting
large earnings recoveries and justifying higher price/earnings multiples on
the grounds that lower inflation would improve the quality of earnings. But
at least part of the excitement in the equity and the gilts market has been
generated by a flow of funds out of low-yielding building society and bank
deposits. Flows into unit trusts have been running at record levels.
The concern among investors is twofold. First, they are worried about the
extent of the recovery, and, second, they are anxious to preserve a running
return at a time of falling interest rates. Attention has focused on
interest sensitive stocks such as banks whose ability to pay higher
dividends has increased just as provisions have started to fall. Property
shares, too, have been in demand, as have electricity stocks which offer
both yield and the prospect of dividend increases.
Movements of UK companies within the European top 500 reflect these factors.
Among the large losers have been the growth companies of yore which thrived
during the recession, such as supermarkets and pharmaceutical companies. J.
Sainsbury may have managed a 17 per cent increase in profit and a 23 per
cent return on capital but it has still slipped to 39 from 26th place in the
rankings. Kwik Save, with a return on capital of 44 per cent, slipped even
further to 352 from 266, though the new-look Asda managed to buck the
rankings trend.
The proximate reason for the supermarkets' bad performance is pressure on
margins as more and more money is invested in new stores and competition
increases from the discount outlets. The worry in pharmaceuticals has been
related to US healthcare reform and the more general fear that pressure on
medical costs around the world will reduce the profitability of patented
prescription drugs. Glaxo thus slipped from second to seventh place, while
Wellcome moved to 59 from 29.
Also hit by a shift in sentiment have been the drinks companies. In the case
of Bass - down to 93rd place from 57 - the worry has been the pressures on
the brewers as a result of excess capacity and parallel imports from France
at a time of shrinking demand. Guinness has suffered from the reluctance of
whisky drinkers to trade up in the less flamboyant 1990s. Though its faith
in the value of brands remains undiminished, impatience among investors at
repeated downgrades of profits expectations has taken its toll. Guinness
fell to 29th place from 15.
By contrast, it has been a much more satisfying year for the banks which
have enjoyed windfall profits from foreign exchange trading as well as lower
provisions in the light of falling interest rates. HSBC Holdings has jumped
from 19th place to 8th, though that also reflects its acquisition of Midland
Bank and the astonishing buoyancy of the Hong Kong market.
The latter factor has also helped boost Standard Chartered, up from 259th
place to 165, while the merchant banks have also reflected the buoyant state
of financial markets. Both SG Warburg and Schroders moved up smartly, while
Kleinwort Benson entered the rankings at 492.
Falling gilt market yields and lower bank base rates have also put a
different perspective on the property market. Land Securities jumped to 108
from 136th place in the rankings. Hopes that the construction industry would
benefit from lower interest rates boosted building materials suppliers.
Redland rose to 132 from 166. It was helped also by its extensive interests
in Germany where rebuilding has continued in the east despite the recession
in the west.
Curiously, the yield attractions which have boosted the electricity
companies (Southern, Eastern and Midlands Electricity all moved up among the
leaders), has been less in evidence in the water sector. This may reflect
worries about the cost of capital investment required to meet EU standards.
In some cases this is compounded by concern about diversification into
unregulated markets. Severn Trent, Northwest and Anglian Water all moved
lower.
Among individual companies it has been a remarkable recovery year for
British Aerospace, up to 231 from 464 as restructuring of its aerospace
business and recovery in the car market starts to bite. Having finally
managed to increase its prices, British Steel jumped to 147th place from
229. With the new management installed by Hongkong Land making its presence
felt, Trafalgar House joined the rankings at 319th position.
Reed Elsevier and Zeneca also joined, the former on merger, the latter on
its demerger from ICI. Mirror Group was another addition. Departures
included Charter, Ranks Hovis McDougall (bought by Tomkins), British Vita,
Pentland Group, Iceland Foods and Courtaulds Textiles.

FT  20 JAN 94 / The FT500 (20): Enter blue-chip Argentaria - The first four
institutions on the Madrid stock exchange in terms of market capitalisation
are all controlled by the government / Country Analyses - Spain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS

<TEXT>
There was no whispering, back-door entry by Argentaria into the FT500. The
Spanish banking group came in with a bang that shot it into the upper
echelons.
Previously unlisted, through being wholly state-owned, Argentaria placed 25
per cent of its equity on the market in May, and then another 25 per cent in
November, and displaced Banco Bilbao Vizcaya as the largest Spanish bank in
terms of market capitalisation.
May's Argentaria One had netted Pta120bn in a heavily subscribed placement,
and the combination of unsatisfied investor demand and the bank's strong
third-quarter figures ensured a further Pta170bn for the Spanish exchequer
when Argentaria Two was offered six months later. With Argentaria now
recognised as a solid blue chip, the top Spanish companies at present have a
distinctly 'statified' air about them: the first four institutions on the
Madrid stock exchange in terms of market capitalisation - the
telecommunications group Telefonica; the electrical utility, Endesa; Repsol,
the energy corporation; and Argentaria - are all controlled by the
government. Together, they represent 35 per cent of the Bolsa's total
capitalisation.
Argentaria's chairman, Francisco Luzon, says he would like to avoid tapping
the markets again this year, although he concedes that the decision whether
to make a further share offering depends on the government. He hopes to
consolidate a business which saw a 30 per cent rise in operating profit in
the first nine months of last year and a 6 per cent rise in its deposits.
There is nothing, of course, to stop the government reducing its equity in
Argentaria to below 50 per cent while still controlling the group. It did
exactly that in April last year at Repsol, when it placed 13 per cent of the
energy conglomerate and lowered the state shareholding to 41 per cent,
realising Pta110bn in the process. At Telefonica, the government maintains
its control over domestic communications with a 32 per cent shareholding.
However, the eyes of most fund managers scrutinising Spanish companies are
likely to be focused in the coming months on Endesa, where the government is
expected to sell off part of its 67 per cent shareholding.
Endesa, long a favoured Spanish stock, is viewed by analysts as more
attractive still, as a result of a government-sponsored reorganisation of
the domestic electricity sector that will come into operation this year. The
overhaul includes a fine-tuning of the pricing system and a series of asset
sales by the more indebted utilities to more financially healthy ones such
as Endesa.
The state-owned utility will lose the price advantages that it has enjoyed,
but will gain far more through the acquisitions. Essentially, it will
increase its retail market strength and improve a generating mix that has,
in the past, been over-dependent on coal. The final approval of the
electricity sector's overhaul could well be followed by a decision to reduce
the government's equity in Endesa.
The fortunes of Telefonica and of Repsol will also be closely monitored, for
both face challenges in the months ahead. Telefonica's is centred on the
impact of deregulation; while Repsol, which has already waged the
liberalisation battle, is finalising details for the purchase of Enagas,
Spain's monopoly gas supplier, and is set to create one of the biggest
natural gas companies in Europe.
Telefonica is putting on a brave face as it prepares for competition on its
home turf, and this could well be justified on account of the government's
apparent determination to protect the company by delaying as long as
possible the implementation of deregulatory measures drawn up the EU. The
company claims that it will hold on to a market share of at least 75 per
cent of the deregulated services, and that it will at most lose 4 per cent
of its revenue.
The chairman, Candido Velazquez, has nonetheless taken competition on board,
and has signed up JP Morgan as a key partner to assist Telefonica's bid for
strategic alliances and foreign acquisitions.
The Spanish company announced last month that it was undertaking 'intensive
co-operation' with Unisource, and this is viewed as a first step towards
taking an equity stake in the joint venture that links the telecom companies
of the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland. Meanwhile, Telefonica is
establishing itself in Latin America, where it has holdings in telecom
operators in Chile, Argentina and Puerto Rico.
Repsol continues to be highly profitable. It reported a 27.5 per cent rise
in operating profits to Pta112.6bn in the first nine months of last year,
brought its chemical division back into profit in the third quarter, and
posted a 63 per cent profit increase to Pta27bn for Gas Natural, the gas
supplier which it controls and 45 per cent owns. Repsol's healthy balance
sheet is more than useful as it prepares to have the group acquire, through
Gas Natural, the government-owned distributor Enagas in a deal worth more
than Pta80bn.

By common consent, west German business has just emerged from its worst year
since the war. Automotive manufacturers and engineering concerns, the
country's top export earners, for example, suffered production cuts of 25
per cent and 10 per cent respectively. But the Bayerische Hypo Bank's
forecast of just over a year ago, that 'the looming recession will not turn
out to be a serious disaster for most German companies' has proved to be
right so far.
The reason, as the bank implied, was that companies were able to cushion the
shocks by drawing on reserves of financial fat laid down in the previous
decade of relative prosperity. Nowhere was this cushion more apparent than
at Daimler-Benz, the country's industrial flagship, which drew down some
DM2bn from reserves salted away in better times to limit its nine-month
losses - according to German accounting standards  - to just DM181m. By US
principles, however, the group slumped DM2bn into the red.
Since Daimler is the only German company so far listed on the New York Stock
Exchange - it made the move in October - there is no accurate way to
penetrate the books of other companies to win a clear impression of the
impact of the slump on earnings. But there can be no mistaking the effects
of recession on German management. Galvanised by its rude awakening, it has
set about rationalisation and restructuring with unprecedented vigour. Lean
management, lean production and concentration on 'core' operations have
become the watchwords. Encrusted management bureaucracies have been broken
down. Workforces have been cut ruthlessly. The traditionally cosy
relationship between capital and labour has been brought into question and a
new order is emerging. Planned investments have been subjected to the most
rigorous examination, and, in many cases, scrapped. Long-time problem
subsidiaries have been unceremoniously dumped.
Daimler, the lumbering automotive, aerospace and electrical engineering
group, is a case in point. AEG, its stand-alone electrical and electronics
engineering subsidiary, now faces a new future as an integrated provider of
equipment and services for the rest of the group. Its domestic appliances
division is to go to Electrolux. Other divisions, finally adjudged too small
to compete internationally have been folded up into joint ventures with
General Electric of the US, for example. Subsidiaries making electricity
meters and motors will be sold.
Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa) is to close at least six sites and its defence
business, crippled by government spending cuts, is to be 'minimalised' in
the words of Mr Edzard Reuter, Daimler chairman. Just before Christmas,
Dasa's MTU aircraft engine business announced a share swap with Pratt &amp;
Whitney of the US, tightening an existing relationship.
Group-wide workforce reduction plans for this year and last allow for at
least 50,000 job losses: mostly in Germany. And change will continue:
partnerships are under discussion in other sectors. AEG's DM2bn-a-year
railways business, forced out of a planned deal with Siemens last year by
the Berlin cartel office, still needs more international muscle.
Like many other German companies, Daimler has taken advantage of the
recession to drive through changes which in better times would have run into
severe opposition from the workforce. The result, as for many other listed
companies, has been an extraordinary resurgence of investor confidence. The
Frankfurt stock exchange's DAX index, which rose around 40 per cent last
year, headed ever more sharply upwards from mid-summer as confidence grew
that Daimler, the lame duck Volkswagen, the battered chemicals giants and
others were coming to grips with their structural problems and could fairly
be nominated as 'recovery stocks' with plenty of profit potential.
The liveliness of German share prices has admittedly been enhanced by other
factors. For example, confidence has been increased by inferences drawn from
recent gross national product figures that the west German economy is
unlikely to fall any further in the current cycle. The Bundesbank's cautious
erosion of interest rates has mobilised funds, and signs that inflation is
coming under control give grounds for more optimism. Further impetus has
come from large volumes of foreign liquidity, especially from US investors
looking to correct their under-weighting in Germany.
In sum, the investment community has nominated Germany Incorporated as a
holding with 'recovery' written all over it. Many of the blue chip
industrial companies expect to be up and running by 1995.
But it is as well to remember another portion of the Bayerische Hypo Bank's
late-1992 forecast, in which it warned of 'a sword of Damocles' hanging over
large swathes of German industry and the banks which finance it. The
cost-cutting and rationalisation efforts of the larger groups have created a
disruptive backwash through the ranks of small and medium-sized Mittelstand
companies which supply the big names with parts and services.
Under intense pressure to reduce their prices, many have already gone under
and many more are struggling to survive. A measure of the scale of the
danger was provided in early December by Mr Hilmar Kopper, chairman of
Deutsche Bank, who estimated that 1993 provisions for loan risks would be a
record DM3bn. Some 90 per cent of that was required to cover risks within
Germany, he said.

FT  20 JAN 94 / The FT500 (9): Handle numbers with extreme care - Andrew
Jack discusses the disparities in regulations governing reporting practices
in countries across Europe and examines, in particular, the radical
revisions being made in the United Kingdom / Accounting Standards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Rarely in the subject of financial reporting has so much flux affected so
many companies across Europe in such a short period.
Radical changes in regulation, accounting and in the search for finance are
causing enormous alteration, and presenting new challenges and opportunities
to readers of company accounts.
Probably the most eye-catching example of reform came in September last year
when Daimler-Benz, Germany's biggest industrial company, released first half
results which plunged from a net profit of DM965m to a net loss of DM949m.
The unexpected swing of nearly DM2bn was the result of a new format of
reporting, forced by its need to comply with US accounting standards so that
it could gain a listing on the New York stock exchange last October.
Under Germany standards, Daimler-Benz continued to show profits of DM168m in
the first six months of the year, compared with DM1.02bn in the same period
in 1992. The principal difference between the two sets of figures was that
German accounting allows the release of hidden reserves to camouflage
operating losses.
'It shows that any idea that you could apply a standard adjustment ratio to
convert Germany to British figures is ridiculous,' says Christopher Nobes,
Coopers &amp; Lybrand professor of accounting at Reading University, who
specialises in international accounting trends. 'It was always crazy to try
to say that to multiply by two would convert one to the other.'
Daimler-Benz - which is likely to be followed by other companies - has had
to restate its results as part of a search for new money from investors away
from its traditional supporters: domestic banks.
But aside from international investor pressure for change, companies are
having to adjust to new demands. Probably the most striking instance is in
the UK, which is in the midst of radical revisions to accounting standards.
The Accounting Standards Board (ASB) has considerably more powers than its
predecessor body. A legal opinion last year suggested its guidelines have
the force of law.
A separate body under the same parent institution called the Financial
Reporting Review Panel also has the power to force companies to restate
their accounts if they do not comply with standards in force. One of the
most significant changes brought about by the ASB is FRS 1, the financial
reporting standard on the cash flow statement. Over the past few months, FRS
3, a standard on the profit and loss account, has also come fully into
force.
FRS 3 all but abolishes extraordinary items, brings all remaining such
charges above the earnings line, and introduces new disclosure requirements.
The ASB's urgent issues task force has also been active, issuing a range of
abstracts including a highly controversial one requiring the difference
between the purchase and sale price of an acquisition once sold to be passed
through the profit and loss account.
British companies are now also beginning to reflect in their accounts mooted
ASB changes, including a tougher line on debt masquerading as equity, and on
the treatment of off-balance sheet finance.
Elsewhere across Europe, many countries still present accounts according to
tax legislation (which tends to emphasise lower profits) rather than the
'Anglo-Saxon' model geared more to investors. But this is changing.
Professor Nobes says Norway, Sweden, Finland and France are all moving
towards disentangling their tax from their accounting systems in response to
the search for access to new capital markets.
In Italy, companies will for the first time begin complying with the
requirements of the EC fourth directive, which requires a different format,
greater disclosures and the need for an audit. In Portugal, companies will
begin to comply for the first time with the EC seventh directive on
consolidated accounts.
Generally, comparisons between European companies in different jurisdictions
remain highly fraught.
Professor Nobes particularly stresses discrepancies in reporting of anything
affected by tax, such as depreciation, long-term contracts and provisions.
He highlights wide variations in valuations of assets: at historical costs
in Germany, and at 1991 and 1984 values in Italy and Spain respectively,
reflecting the last time the countries required mandatory revaluations. He
also raises discrepancies in the treatment of inventories (last-in,
first-out is common in Italy and non-existent in the UK), and the treatment
of goodwill, joint ventures and associates.
National standard setters are increasingly recognising the importance of
requirements that transcend their countries' own borders.
Meanwhile, the International Accounting Standards Committee continues to
strive for a set of rules with fewer alternatives which may be given renewed
credibility if ratified by Iosco, the international organisation of
securities commissions.
But such consensus is still a long way off. In the meantime, readers of
accounts should handle numbers with extreme care.

FT  20 JAN 94 / The FT500 (7): Barometer of business
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The FT500, now in its 12th year of publication, has come to be recognised as
Europe's principal barometer of business.
The main table ranks the 500 biggest European companies by market
capitalisation.
A second table ranks the top 500 UK companies on the London Stock Exchange.
This year, for the first time, there are two new international listings -
the top 100 US and the top 100 Japanese companies, also by market
capitalisation.
A company's capitalisation is the number of its shares multiplied by the
price of its shares, and therefore measures the value of the company in the
eyes of investors.
Capitalisation is chosen as a yardstick because it has a number of
advantages over other methods.
It is a good guide to performance over time; it gives a proper weighting to
banks, whose positions are distorted in tables based on turnover; and it
takes proper account of loss-making companies, which disappear from lists
based on profits.
The stock market is particularly important in the UK, whereas in Germany the
banks play a larger role in corporate finance, and in France and Italy many
of the biggest groups are state-owned.
However, the table showing the 200 top companies in Europe ranked by
turnover includes companies which are publicly-owned and which appear in the
top 500, and those which are owned privately or by the state.
Rankings: The rankings of the European 500, the UK 500 and the US 100 and
Japanese 100 tables are based on market capitalisation at the end of
September 1993. Preference capital has been excluded for this calculation.
Companies that have 75 per cent or more of equity held by one other concern,
or that have only a minimal proportion of their capital openly traded on the
market, have been excluded.
The main source for the European and UK capitalisation tables was FT
Analysis, with additional information from Datastream International, local
stock exchanges, and the FT World Actuaries Index.
The source for US and Japan capitalisation tables was Standard &amp; Poor's
Compustat Services.
The ranking of companies having the same capitalisation has been determined
by reference to their turnover or, where necessary, their profit.
Figures in the European, US and Japanese tables are in dollars, using
September 1993 average exchange rates. For ease of comparison, turnover and
profit figures for last year are also shown at September 1993 average
exchange rates. UK 500 figures are in sterling.
Accounts: Consolidated accounts have been used wherever possible. When
parent company accounts only have been reported, these figures have been
used and annotated.
Turnover is shown net of sales taxes and inter-group sales. A ranking based
on the latest year's figure is also given.
Profit is disclosed profit before tax and minority interest. For the UK
companies, it is also before extraordinary items. Return on capital employed
(ROCE) is based on pre-tax profit plus interest divided by capital employed
at the beginning of the financial year. ROCE is not calculated if pre-tax
loss plus interest payment reflects a loss. For banks, capital employed is
equivalent to shareholders' funds.
UK Investment Trusts: The rankings are based on market capitalisation at the
end of September 1993. The shareholders' funds figure is based on the number
of shares in issue and the stated net asset value.
This table has been compiled with the assistance of NatWest Securities.
Other tables: Also included for the first time this year, is a table showing
the auditors for the top 100 UK companies.
Because of distortions in percentages when companies go from profit to loss
and vice versa, the tables showing largest increases in profit and largest
decreases in profit exclude these companies.
However, tables showing the largest movements from loss to profits and vice

FT  20 JAN 94 / The FT500 (2): Caution the guideline for Europe's No 1 -
Shell's reputation for being financially conservative may just be the
quality needed to help it retain its premier position in a period of
uncertainty over the direction of oil prices / Profile of Royal Dutch/Shell
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The scallop-shaped logo of the Royal Dutch/Shell Group of companies is one
of the most pervasive in the commercial world. As a symbol of an oil company
which on the basis of size is challenged only by Exxon of the US, it is
recognisable in virtually every country.
The logo itself has undergone various stylistic changes since the company
was formed out of a 1907 alliance between Royal Dutch Petroleum Company and
the Shell Transport and Trading Company of the UK. But the original
structure of the company has proved remarkably resilient.
The 1907 agreement called for the retention of separate identities, while
the merger itself was based on a 60:40 split. Today, Royal Dutch remains a
parent company, deriving its income from its 60 per cent interest in the
group of operating companies. Shell Transport and Trading holds a similar
position in the UK, based on its 40 per cent ownership of the group.
The joint group managing directors of the parent firms, led by chairman of
the committee of managing directors, CAJ Herkstroter, still reflect the
Anglo-Dutch roots of the company. This is in contrast with the intensely
'national' character of many of the individual operating units. It is an
arrangement which may appear to be a recipe for conflict, but which has
clearly worked well over the years.
The glue which binds Shell together has been the careful cultivation of a
multinational layer of senior management whose outlook is international and
who share a common corporate culture. 'We find that it's good for executives
to go to countries where they may not be able to speak the language and
begin to solve problems,' according to one senior Shell manager.
Such structures and practices have helped Shell to weather nearly every
combination of economic, commercial and political storm in its history. But
critics say it has also left it with bureaucratic management and an internal
focus which does not necessarily reflect the interests of its investors.
But its reputation for being financially conservative and cautious (gearing
in 1992 was just 7 per cent) may just be the qualities needed to help it to
retain its premier position in corporate Europe in a period of great
uncertainty over the direction of oil prices.
Shell's structure may also prove to be the model for how an integrated oil
company can survive and perhaps even thrive in a weak price environment
A recent study by NatWest Securities in Edinburgh predicted that Shell's
earnings, for example, will prove to be relatively impervious to
persistently low prices over the next three years. This is because of
expected benefits for its downstream operations in refining and marketing
from low crude oil prices.
Another offsetting factor would be the possibility that low oil prices would
help to fuel an overall economic recovery. In that case there might be a
stronger than expected upturn in chemicals, a sector in Continued on next
page
which Shell is among the top 10 companies worldwide and the dominant
producer among the integrated oil companies, although much of its capacity
is concentrated in high-cost continental Europe.
The NatWest study concluded that Shell's medium-term fortunes are dependent
less on oil price movements than on the overall state of the world economy.
Other strengths which are likely to help Shell through the present turmoil
in the industry include a strong presence in the fastest growing economies
in Asia. It also has one of the largest international natural gas
businesses, a market segment where prices have so far stayed relatively
buoyant as countries and companies realise the environmental and cost
benefits associated with the fuel.
Shell's reputation has been enhanced by its effectiveness in finding new
reserves at relatively low costs. Figures from Lehman Brothers, the US
investment bank, show that Shell's finding costs over the past three years
have averaged Dollars 2.50 per barrel of oil equivalent (which includes
natural gas and condensate). That compares with an average among European
oil companies of Dollars 3.58 a barrel, and an average for the US majors of
Dollars 3.97 a barrel.
Shell's relative efficiency means, however, that cost-cutting, the theme
which last year underpinned the share performance of other oil companies,
such as British Petroleum, has a less marked impact.
The NatWest study also notes that the company's low gearing means that any
cost-cutting it does achieve will make less of a bottom line impact than
similar actions taken by more highly geared competitors.
But Shell does share one big concern with its competitors: that oil prices
drifting in the Dollars 13-Dollars 16 range of the last six months will lead
to the postponement or cancellation of a number of capital-intensive
projects.
Over time that would constrain the growth of Shell's worldwide asset base,
perhaps its main pillar of corporate strength.

FT  20 JAN 94 / The FT500 (1): Roche sets the pace for the FT500 - Peter
Martin examines some of the unique qualities of the annual rankings and
finds that they are essentially forward looking, reflecting the markets'
best guess about the future performance of companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
There is a striking change near the top of this year's FT500: the rise of
Roche, the Swiss pharmaceuticals group, from sixth to third place. The
number of places risen is not so remarkable; what stands out is the sheer
size of Roche's market capitalisation. At Dollars 35.7bn, it is only Dollars
5bn behind that of British Telecommunications, the UK's dominant phone
company.
Investors value Roche at four times its total revenues, but they are
prepared to offer BT only a multiple of two. And you could in theory buy all
the shares of the Netherlands and British companies that make up Unilever,
fifth in the FT500, for less than a single year of the consumer product
group's revenues.
Behind the Roche story lie some of the FT500's unique aspects. Because the
annual ranking is based on market capitalisation, it offers a way of
comparing companies from different countries and different industries,
regardless of the gaps between their accounting conventions. Because it
takes the value that investors place upon a company, the ranking changes
from year to year as profit outlooks and investment attitudes change. And
because that value depends in large part on investors' expectations about
companies' profits growth, the FT500 is essentially forward looking,
reflecting the markets' best guess about the future performance of
companies, their industries, and the domestic economies to which they are
exposed.
Roche illustrates the way these factors change from year to year.
Pharmaceuticals companies in general have had a rough time: Glaxo Holdings,
last year the third-ranked company in the FT500, has fallen to seventh
place; SmithKline Beecham has dropped from 11 to 23, Wellcome from 29 to 59.
These are British companies, but outside the UK, there are similar stories.
Elf Sanofi, controlled by France's state-owned Elf-Aquitaine oil giant, has
fallen from 112 to 152; Novo Nordisk, Denmark's world leader in synthetic
insulin, from 165 to 203.
Though the profits of the industry have held up well throughout the
recession - among FT500 sectors with more than a handful of companies, drugs
is by far the most profitable in terms of return on capital employed - the
stock markets have decided that the writing is on the wall. Downward
pressure on prices, through formal government controls or a growing
reluctance of insurers to meet ever-rising prescription bills, is seen as
inevitable around the world. The past year has brought not merely the
Clinton health proposals in the US, which aim to hold down healthcare costs
by strengthening the market power of purchasers against that of providers,
but also a government-induced squeeze on the German drugs market and, in the
past months, tighter controls on Italian prescriptions.
This growing doubt about future profits growth has dragged down
pharmaceuticals companies' share prices around the world. But Roche has
remained immune. In its favour are not only a sparkling operating
performance - profits are up 31 per cent - but also a number of other
factors that run throughout this year's FT500.
First, since Roche is a Swiss company, the relative value of its shares has
benefited from last year's European devaluations. Though these have been
smaller than those of 1992, they have nonetheless raised the value of shares
denominated in hard currencies, such as the D-Mark and the Swiss franc,
against those in weaker varieties. Second, one factor behind the rise in
Roche's market capitalisation over the past few years was a big rights issue
in 1991. The willingness of continental companies to tap the international
capital markets for new equity has greatly increased in recent years, a
trend accelerated by Germany's shift from net exporter of capital to net
importer.
Third, in order to tap those markets continental companies have had to offer
international investors Anglo-Saxon standards of accounting disclosure. The
rush towards frankness has been most noticeable in Switzerland, but last
year also saw a big step forward in Germany, when Daimler-Benz (number 14 in
the FT500) had to agree to report its accounts under US Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles before the Securities and Exchange Commission would
allow it to list on the New York Stock Exchange.
Swiss analysts believe that the greater transparency of accounting
principles among big companies there is enhancing the value of their shares.
Both Roche's ascent to third place and the rise of Union Bank of Switzerland
from 25 to 15 (making it Europe's third most valuable bank) owe something to
these two companies' more transparent accounts as well as to the skills of
their respective researchers and financial experts.
For Europe as a whole, 1993 was a year of healthy stock market performance,
with most leading markets reporting rises of around a quarter, and German
shares leaping by nearly half. Because of the FT500's cut-off date of
September 30, however, the headiest months of the year, in the final
quarter, do not show up in the rankings.
The outperformance of the German stock market was heavily concentrated in
the closing months of the year, which partly, though not entirely, explains
why the biggest German companies turned in a lacklustre performance in this
year's FT500. Siemens slipped from 8th to 10th; Deutsche Bank from 10th to
12th. The big German chemicals companies did not sparkle: Bayer's ranking
was unchanged, Hoechst and BASF both fell.
With a couple of exceptions, British companies also had an unremarkable
year. The best-performing big British company was HSBC Holdings, the parent
of the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank and Britain's Midland Bank, which moved
from 19th to 8th, making it Europe's most valuable bank. This was the year
that HSBC became a true-blue British company, as it brought itself fully
within the UK tax net. But Hongkong still accounts for the lion's share of
the group's profits.
BTR overtook Hanson and now, at number 16, it is rubbing shoulders with
Daimler-Benz (14) a company four times larger in terms of sales and
employees.
French companies have always been under-represented at the top levels of the
FT500, because so many big French businesses are state-owned. Last year's
election of a centre-right government committed to large-scale privatisation
will shortly make that cliche obsolete, and the first signs are evident in
this year's rankings. In at number 79 comes Rhone Poulenc, which took a
stock exchange listing for its ordinary shares in January 1993. Next year's
list will count several more, including Banque Nationale de Paris.
A similar pattern can be expected elsewhere in Europe. Italy's coming wave
of privatisations has not yet made an impact on the FT500, but Spain's
Argentaria, a merger of state-owned banks, obtained a stock market listing
in May, entering the rankings at number 107.
Among this year's casualties are several takeover victims. Freia Marabou,
the Norwegian chocolate maker, succumbed to a bid from Philip Morris of the
US, and Germany's Hoesch steel firm surrendered its independence to Fried.
Krupp (joining the FT500 at 340). Au Printemps, the Paris department store,
was taken over by the Pinault investment group (303); and Ranks Hovis
McDougall of the UK succumbed to Tomkins, the conglomerate (139).
Two friendly mergers united companies already well-placed in the rankings.
In publishing, the UK's Reed (63 last year) got together with the
Netherlands' Elsevier (100 last year) to form a new group ranked 41st. In
France, Matra's merger with Hachette created a curious hybrid of media group
and defence contractor, ranked 235.
Finally, the year was marked by the welcome return to something like their
previous stature of fallen angels such as Italy's Olivetti, back in the list
at 363, and Sweden's big two banks. Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken returned
at number 199 after its shares slid so badly during Sweden's banking crisis
that it disappeared from last year's list altogether. Svenska Handelsbanken,
which stayed in the rankings by the skin of its teeth last year, recorded
the biggest rise of any European company, up 242 places to 223. And British
Aerospace, another near victim last year, jumped 167 places to 272.

Pepsi-Cola International, the soft drinks arm of PepsiCo, plans to invest
Dollars 115m over five years in Slovakia and the Czech Republic, the company
announced yesterday in Bratislava.
This brings PepsiCo's planned investments in the fast food and drinks
sectors in central and eastern Europe to almost Dollars 1bn, Mr Richard
Norton, senior vice-president for business development in the Middle East,
Africa and eastern Europe, said.
The company recently announced plans to invest Dollars 500m in Poland and
Dollars 115m in Hungary in local production facilities. It is involved in a
Dollars 150m joint venture resine plant in Russia (resine is used to make
plastic bottles).
The investment will be split roughly according to the size of the two
countries, with Dollars 85m going to the Czech Republic and Dollars 30m to
Slovakia. It includes a 20,000 sq metre packaging plant under construction
on the outskirts of Prague, and the establishment of sales and distribution
networks in both countries. PepsiCo will increase its Czech workforce to
about 600 employees and provide jobs for about 200 workers in Slovakia.
Last month, Kentucky Fried Chicken which along with Pizza Hut and Taco Bell
is owned by PepsiCo, announced plans to open up to 40 restaurants in the
Czech Republic over four years.

Asia-Pacific

<TEXT>
Deutsche Bank, Germany's largest bank, is targeting the Asia-Pacific region
for the next decade after concentrating expansion plans on North America
during recent years.
The bank's Asia-Pacific operations had the potential to substantially boost
profits during the next 10 years, said Mr Ulrich Cartellieri, the board
member responsible for that region.
The region generated profits of about DM500m (Dollars 286m) last financial
year, compared with group profits of nearly DM6bn.
Mr Cartellieri said. 'This is the world's fastest growing region and will
require huge investments in infrastructure. The most conservative estimate
puts the requirements at Dollars 500bn over the next four years. We want to
help fund that expansion.'
The bank employs more than 3,000 people in the Asia-Pacific region, of which
slightly less than 400 are based in Japan.
Most of the bank's growth in the region would be in south-east Asia with
little from Japan, he said. The speed of growth would depend upon how
quickly governments deregulated their financial markets.
'Most are advancing in leaps and bounds. Some are having to move from the
Stone Age to derivatives in only a few months,' he explained.
The bank would concentrate on commercial banking, trade finance, capital
market operations, brokerage and private investment banking.
The Morgan Grenfell subsidiary, would focus its efforts in capital markets.
Singapore is the only centre where Morgan Grenfell has depth, he added.
Deutsche Bank had asked the Vietnamese authorities for permission to upgrade
its representative offices in Hanoi and Saigon to full branches. India is
also a priority for the commercial banking operations. A licence had just
been received for Bangalore, and new offices were planned in other Indian
cities including Calcutta.

Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar is stepping down as a vice-chairman of Skandinaviska
Enskilda Banken.
'It is natural that after leaving Volvo, I should also leave the SE-Banken
board so that I remain free for the future,' he said.
Mr Gyllenhammar has been a board member at SE-Banken since 1979, and
vice-chairman since 1991. He is expected to step down at the bank's annual
general meeting in April.

FT  20 JAN 94 / BA attacks Air France 'subsidy': UK carrier calls on
Brussels to force the repayment of Dollars 254m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Airways yesterday launched a vigorous attack on Air France as it
urged the European Commission to force the French state-owned flag carrier
to repay a FFr1.5bn (Dollars 254m) capital injection, saying it constituted
a subsidy in contravention of the Treaty of Rome.
The UK airline's attack comes as an EU commission is due to recommend a
policy on state aid to ailing European national airlines, many of which are
seeking support from their governments.
BA and the UK government have campaigned against additional state aid to
financially troubled European state carriers, which they argue are severely
distorting the European airline market.
BA's objection to the Air France refinancing package now before the EU
follows Brussels approval for earlier government injections to Air France
totalling FFr5.84bn during 1991 and 1992.
The privatised UK carrier is worried that the French government will soon
seek approval for further aid to Air France totalling more than FFr5bn as
part of the latest rescue package for the troubled French carrier.
Air France last night rejected BA's claims and insisted the FFr1.5bn
injection involved convertible bonds and other paper issued under normal
market conditions.
It also stated that the earlier FFr5.84bn it had received involved FFr2bn in
a government capital injection approved by the EU as not consisting of a
state subsidy, with the remainder raised on the French financial market.
Mr David Holmes, BA's head of government and industry affairs, said the
current FFr1.5bn aid package 'was not a commercial investment: it was state
aid which contravenes the Treaty of Rome and should be given back'.
He added that Air France's 'financial salvation' should lie in its own hands
and not through state handouts 'that are unfairly and illegally distorting
Europe's air transport industry'.
Although the funds were claimed to be required to finance earlier
restructuring at Air France, BA said that there was no evidence of any such
restructuring taking place.
'Air France's capacity continued to increase, its total workforce remained
practically static, its investment policy focused almost entirely on
expanding its fleet through the acquisition of new aircraft . . .', BA said.
The UK carrier added that other European airlines had realigned themselves
without the benefit of state financial support and Air France should do the
same.

The European Parliament yesterday appeared to have won the argument over its
right under the Maastricht treaty to ratify the Uruguay Round world trade
agreement on behalf of the European Union, writes David Gardner in
Strasbourg.
The Commission and some member states were reluctant to allow parliament to
ratify the treaty. But Sir Leon Brittan, EU trade commissioner, said
yesterday it was only right that parliament should take the final vote.

FT  20 JAN 94 / Greece softens stance on conditions for EU entry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Greek presidency of the European Union yesterday disavowed a proposal it
made last week to limit EU regional aid available to the remote and poorer
regions of the Nordic and Alpine countries which are negotiating entry to
the union.
The proposal, which would have had most effect on Norway and Sweden, the two
countries most reticent on membership, could have complicated negotiations
which have to be completed by March 1 to keep to the deadline of entry in
January next year.
Yesterday, however, Mr Theodoros Pangalos, the Greek European affairs
minister, said of the proposal that 'it's not our position, it's simply a
working paper'. The confidential January 10 paper, nevertheless, is clearly
described as a 'presidency proposal'.
Mr Pangalos, who presented the Greek presidency's work programme to the
European Parliament yesterday, is to visit Sweden, Finland and Norway from
tomorrow for talks on the enlargement talks.
On the sensitive issues of regional and agricultural subsidies and how much
the four applicants should contribute to the EU budget, the minister
insisted 'there is no Greek proposal at the moment, and there won't be until
we've completed our talks with the candidate countries'.
The European Commission yesterday agreed on the shareout of the Ecu14bn
(Dollars 15.5bn) social fund for 1994-99, which is aimed mainly at combating
long-term and youth unemployment.
The Ecu14bn goes principally to those countries with the largest number of
unemployed, excepting Greece, Portugal, Ireland and more than half of Spain,
which, as relatively poorer areas, are entitled to more generous EU
structural aid.
The UK share will be Ecu3.4bn, France gets Ecu3.2bn, Germany gets Ecu1.9bn,
Spain Ecu1.8bn and Italy Ecu1.7bn.
The social fund is mainly for training and retraining the unemployed, but
part of it can now be used to retrain workers who work in industries
vulnerable to structural change.

FT  20 JAN 94 / Roche moves up to third place in FT500 as Shell keeps lead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN, Financial Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Roche, the Swiss drugs group, is the big winner in this year's FT500 ranking
of Europe's top companies, rising to third place from sixth.
Roche's market capitalisation - the value of all its shares when the survey
was taken - is not far behind that of British Telecommunications. Both are
still well behind Royal Dutch/Shell, the Anglo-Dutch oil group, which again
ranks first.
In general, drugs companies did poorly in this year's rankings, making
Roche's rise the more striking. Glaxo of the UK came second last year, but
has now dropped to seventh place.
The FT500, published as a special section today, compares European quoted
companies by market capitalisation. A second ranking, the FT UK 500,
highlights the leading UK companies. The top 100 companies from the US and
Japan are also included.
This year's survey also shows:
Swedish banks made a striking recovery. Scandinaviska Enskilda Banken, which
had dropped out of the ranking, reappeared at 199th. Svenska Handelsbanken
was the biggest gainer, rising 242 places to 223rd.
Other big winners included British Aerospace, up 233 places to 231st;
Finland's Repola, up 132 places to 255th; and Spain's Fomentos de
Construcciones, up 128 to 312nd.
Big losers were Montedison, the Italian chemicals company, which fell 235
places to 468th; Racal, the UK electronics group, down 192 places to 480th;
and Delhaize, the Netherlands chemicals company, down 152 to 327th.
Courtaulds Textiles of the UK and Club Mediterranee of France dropped out of
the European 500.
The rankings include several companies formed by mergers, such as Reed
Elsevier (41st), the Netherlands-British publishing group; and Matra
Hachette (235th), France's publishing and defence group. Other new entrants
are former state-owned companies: Rhone-Poulenc, the French chemicals
company, joins at 79th; Argentaria, the Spanish bank, enters at 107th.
Omission: LWT should have been included in the UK 500 at 205th, with a
market capitalisation of Pounds 517m.

FT  20 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Tesco cheer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A rare piece of good news for the food retail sector came in the form of a
trading statement from Tesco, which was well received by the market and sent
the shares forward 15 to 251 1/2 p in hefty trading of 18m.
Food analysts said the supermarket group's decision to cut its capital
expenditure and store opening programme eased concern over market
saturation. They were also cheered by the decision to increase the dividend
ahead of earnings growth. 'Tesco has at last faced reality with this
statement,' said one specialist.
As widely rumoured, the supermarket group decided to begin making provisions
for depreciating its buildings and also to make a write-down of Pounds 85m
on surplus land.
The positive sentiment, together with the rising market, helped the other
retailers. Among these, J. Sainsbury climbed 10 to 477p.
Strong two-way business in Rolls-Royce saw turnover jump to 18m as US buyers
returned to the stock, ignoring a profits downgrade from Hoare Govett, the
group's broker.
However, there were fears that the renewed US interest may soon challenge
the 29.5 per cent limit on overseas ownership set in the group's articles of
association.
Hoare reduced its current year forecast by Pounds 10m to Pounds 75m. The
shares firmed 1 1/2 to 174p.
British Aerospace was back in favour on hopes of a lucrative Hawk order from
India, and a view that the recent falls had been overdone. The shares
bounced 25 to 416p, with volume reaching 7.5m.
The Pacific Rim-influenced bank stocks, principally HSBC and Standard
Chartered, continued to race ahead, boosted by the latest rise on the Hong
Kong market.
Standard was 26 higher at 1229p, after reaching 1248p, after Cazenove, the
bank's broker, was said to have given the stock a strong push, highlighting
the discrepancy between Standard's prospective price/earnings ratio, around
the 7.5 mark, compared with that of HSBC, some 10.5 times, and other Far
Eastern stocks which are rated around 20 times earnings. Some of the
market's super optimists are forecasting a doubling of Standard's share
price.
HSBC added 29 at 976p. Bank of East Asia is not a subsidiary of HSBC, as
incorrectly reported here yesterday.
TSB rose 10 to a record 286p as a number of broking firms continued to
upgrade their estimates and recommendations on the stock following the
recent preliminary figures.
Oil issues were restrained by worries about crude oil prices, but were also
said to have been held back by hints that Enterprise and Lasmo are about to
have their debt ratings reduced by Standard &amp; Poor's, one of the leading US
credit-rating agencies.
Enterprise retained a 7 gain at 469p, still helped by stories that
Elf-Aquitaine has decided not to sell its 10 per cent stake in the short
term. Lasmo edged up 2 1/2 to 126 1/2 p following news that its important
Indonesian oil equivalent reserves have been upgraded by 13 per cent, or 59m
barrels of oil equivalent, following an independent assessment.
BAA lost 4 to 1056p on fears that a review on airport regulation announced
on Tuesday may have a negative impact on BAA's pricing formula discussions
with the government due to start later this year.
In a strong property sector, MEPC was further boosted by a positive annual
meeting and the shares jumped 29 to 561p.
Some leading leisure stocks were knocked, with Forte declining 5 to 276p.
Kleinwort Benson, which has Forte as a 'hold', said the stock was overbought
in the face of the hesitant pace of recovery in the hotel market.
Turnover in Burton hit 16m as Lehman Brothers matched a buyer and seller of
6.5m shares. The deals were struck at 73p and 73 3/4 p. The stock nudged up
a half-penny to 74p.

<TEXT>
Pharmaceutical stocks came under heavy pressure in New York late yesterday
after disappointing results from US group Pfizer led to profits downgrades
and heavy selling of the whole sector. SmithKline Beecham and Glaxo were
most seriously affected in spite of favourable fundamental news.
SmithKline has benefited from enthusiastic response to its new shingles
treatment Famvir and received a further push from a hefty note from NatWest
Securities. NatWest said SmithKline was poised to benefit at the expense of
Wellcome, whose headline product, Zovirax, is poised to come off patent
soon. The note, which featured unpleasant photographs of patients disfigured
by herpes, failed to impact on the Wellcome shares, which rose 21 to 683p.
SmithKline 'A' put on 4 at 439p, but lost a penny to 399p in the Units,
which were trading at the equivalent of 392p in New York shortly after the
London market closed.
Meanwhile, Glaxo announced that its Japanese subsidiary had received
approval from the Ministry of Health and Welfare for both oral and
injectable forms of Zofran, the anti-nausea treatment for chemotherapy
patients. The shares closed a penny up at 681p in London but the American
Depositary Receipts were trading at the equivalent of 673p after the market
shut.
Pfizer shares tumbled Dollars 6 to Dollars 61 7/8 in early US trading, with
PaineWebber among several houses to cut forecasts.

FT  20 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Tremors in gas sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The oil and gas areas lagged behind the rest of the market and also provided
one of the market's most heavily traded stocks in British Gas, which
recovered only partially from heavy selling pressure early in the session.
The early selling was triggered by bearish stories said to have emanated
from a lunch on Tuesday at Smith New Court, the securities house, which
hosted Ms Clare Spottiswoode, the new director general of Ofgas, the gas
industry watchdog, and a number of investment institutions.
Smith declined to comment but sector specialists said the institutions
appeared notably more cautious towards British Gas following the lunch.
'There are perceptions that the new regulatory regime could well prove
tougher than expected,' said one analyst, who pointed out that Gas shares
are approaching a three-year relative low.
British Gas shares underperformed the wider market all day but managed to
edge ahead to finish a net 4 1/2 higher at 342p. Turnover reached a heavy
13m shares.

FT  20 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stock index futures closed at a record high and volume in the traded options
soared as renewed hopes of a cut in UK interest rates brought hectic trading
to the derivatives sector, writes Joel Kibazo.
In futures, a tentative start to trading gave way to hectic buying of the
March contract on the FT-SE 100 following the release of weaker than
anticipated inflation figures as traders came to the view that the poor
figures would lead to a rate cut.
Dealers said demand was across the board, with independent traders (locals)
said to have been particularly short of stock. This developed into a squeeze
which drove March to an all-time intraday high of 3,506 just before lunch.
Strong arbitrage activity was carried out by many of the leading players in
the market as the contract maintained a strong premium to cash throughout
the day.
March came off the top in early afternoon trading but still closed at a
record high for the future at 3,501, around 16 points ahead of its fair
value premium to cash of about 6 points. Volume was particularly heavy,
reaching 20,677 at the official close, while a further 2,000 lots were dealt
in after-hours' trading.
A very active session was also seen in traded options, where turnover rose
to a hefty 58,425 contracts. However, dealers said activity in the FT-SE 100
option was slightly disappointing, though it reached 25,082 lots, while some
6,315 were traded in the Euro FT-SE option. Amstrad was the busiest stock
option at 2,893 lots, followed by Tesco at 2,582 contracts. HSBC saw 1,954
lots dealt, with Kleinwort Benson said to have shown a keen interest in the
October 950 straddle.

FT  20 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: New peaks for the FT-SE 100 and the
Mid 250 - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Favourable data on UK inflation and retail sales combined with a buying
frenzy among the second line stocks to take the UK equity market to a new
peak yesterday. The FT-SE 100-share Index broke through to a new trading
high at midsession before settling to a new closing peak of 3,475.1, for an
advance on the day of 38.1.
However, the 1 per cent gain in the Footsie was well outpaced by the FT-SE
Mid 250 Index, which bounded ahead by nearly 4 per cent, closing 135.5
points up at an all-time high of 4,148.8. Demand for the Mid 250 issues,
swollen for the past week as investors searched for undervalued stocks,
rocketed yesterday when a leading Swiss-based investment bank struggled to
put in around Pounds 1bn as the preliminary move to issuing a covered
warrant on the sector.
The UK stock market came near to splitting into two halves yesterday. The
Footsie blue chips opened firmly, spurred on by strong performances in Far
Eastern markets overnight and by interest rate optimism across other
European bourses ahead of today's meeting of the Bundesbank.
With the market only one hour into official trading, the pace was put into
overdrive by the announcement of the latest UK retail prices and sales data,
which indicated that inflation was still under control while retail sales
were disappointing - the perfect background for a cut in base rates,
according to equity traders.
The annualised rise of 1.9 per cent in December's retail price index and a
surprising fall of 0.2 per cent in December retail sales was followed by a
jump in the Footsie, which at midsession stood at a new intraday peak of
3,484.5, a gain of 47.5. Share gains were also fuelled by strong rises in UK
government bond prices in response to the statistics on the domestic
economy.
Analysts were somewhat confused by the retail sales statistics which
appeared to contradict other recent data. However, the unexpected fall in
December sales revived hopes that the widely-predicted cut in UK base rates
might now arrive earlier than the spring. Hopes of an early cut in base
rates had been postponed in view of the impending impact of the UK budget
measures announced last November.
At least two trading programmes marched across the dealing screens, and
prices were again driven forward by frantic activity by marketmakers whose
stock books were repeatedly emptied, forcing them to join the rush of buyers
in the marketplace. Investors were completely unwilling to part with stock,
so prices were forced higher. Once again, the blue chips were led forward by
the stock index futures market, where the December contract traded
comfortably above 3,500 at its best moment.
It was soon clear, however, that it was the FT-SE Mid 250 stocks which were
capturing much of the interest. The Footsie stocks eased back, the Index
shedding about 12 points of the early gain, before regaining its poise as
Wall Street edged into a gain of 8.7 Dow points in early deals and
continental European bourses extended their gains.
Seaq volume of 1,320.7m shares, reflected the heavy trading in the smaller
capitalised stocks; non-Footsie business made up around 66 per cent of the
total. On Tuesday, 964.9m shares traded through Seaq for a retail worth of
Pounds 2.17bn, one of the highest figures for the past twelve months.

FT  20 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Record close as weak earnings
news ignored
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK

<TEXT>
Wall Street
US equities jumped to new highs just before the close yesterday, shrugging
off a string of weak earnings reports which had earlier dragged down share
prices, writes Richard Waters in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average see-sawed during the day before ending at a
record peak of 3,884.37 for a net rise of 14.08. It had briefly reached this
level in mid-morning, before poor 1993 results from a number of companies
knocked it down nearly 20 points.
The market recovered briefly after lunchtime with the release of the Federal
Reserve's 'Beige Book', which reported an acceleration of economic growth in
some sectors, and the more positive tone continued through to the close. The
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 followed a similar pattern, finishing 0.05 up at
474.30. Trading volume on the New York SE amounted to 311.4m shares.
Computer and drugs stocks led the slide during the morning as leading
companies in both sectors reported poor results, while banking issues
continued the sell-off which has followed a recent run-up in share prices.
The bad news for computer issues was delivered by Intel, the electronic chip
maker, which announced figures after the markets had closed on Tuesday, and
Digital Equipment, which reported a loss of 53 cents a share in its most
recent quarter and cautioned about the outlook for the first half of 1994.
Digital dropped Dollars 3 5/8 to Dollars 32 3/4 on 2.84m shares traded and
Intel surrendered Dollars 4 3/4 to Dollars 62 1/2 .
The weakness in technology stocks helped to depress the Nasdaq stock index,
which has a higher weighting towards technology companies. The index had
lost 3.74 at 789.28 by the close, down from a record peak the previous day.
Drugs shares were battered after Pfizer, seen as one of the stars of the
industry, reported a marked slowdown in sales in the final three months of
1993. The stock plunged Dollars 5 to Dollars 62 7/8 on the day, in the
process dragging down other pharmaceutical issues. Among the industry
leaders, Merck shed Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 35 7/8 and Bristol-Myers Squibb
Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 58 3/4 . Schering-Plough was among the biggest
losers, falling Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 64 3/8 .
Leading banks continued the retreat which has followed a strong results
season. Citicorp, in spite of its recent strong earnings news, lost Dollars
1 to Dollars 40 1/4 . BankAmerica, the only leading bank to announce figures
yesterday, dipped Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 46 5/8 , as the US's second
largest bank continued to feel the effects of the weak Californian economy.
BancOne fell Dollars 1 1/4 on heavy trading of 3.36m shares on an analyst's
report that its earnings will come under pressure, taking it to Dollars 35
5/8 , around its low for the past 12 months.
Canada
Toronto stocks finished on a mixed note but the TSE 300 index managed a
sixth consecutive all-time closing peak, gaining 1.0 at 4,562.9, after
touching 4,574.3 during the session. Volume was a brisk 96m shares valued at
CDollars 1.3bn.
Strong pipeline, energy and media stocks were offset by sagging gold and
banking issues hit by profit-taking.

FT  20 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets: Foreigners return to South Africa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MATTHEW CURTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Foreigners have been returning to South African equities: net sellers in
1992, last year they were net buyers of R2.8bn (Dollars 830m), R570m worth
in December alone.
Overall, investors bought and sold more than 690m shares in the month,
compared with only 211m in December 1992. US-led foreign purchases took off
early in 1993, but trade in blue chips accelerated in October after
sanctions were lifted. That became a deluge in December, driving share
prices to unheard of levels.
On January 4 the JSE recorded one of its largest single day gains. The
overall share index jumped 179 points to breach the 5,000 level for the
first time. The market has settled in the past 10 days amid profit-taking
and wobbly gold prices. The overall closed yesterday down 31 at 4,821, golds
off 24 at 2,066 and industrials 6 down at 5,446.
Still, the dividend yield on the industrial and overall indices remain at
25-year lows of 2.1 and 2.3 per cent respectively.
What sets the JSE apart is the 'pressure-cooker' influence of exchange
control regulations, re-imposed in 1985. The South African Reserve Bank
requires overseas investors to buy shares, or gilts, using the financial
rand, the foreign investment unit which has traded at a 14 to 30 per cent
discount to the commercial rand in the past year. They have the bonus of
being able to remit dividends at the commercial rate, automatically
improving the dividend yield on a share portfolio.
For years the finrand discount has made South African gilts particularly
attractive for foreigners, but now equities are benefiting too. 'There is
effectively a double market in equities,' says Mr Richard Jesse, a director
at stockbrokers Martin &amp; Co. He says foreign investors calculate value at
one level, and local investors at another.
Exchange control also dams up domestic capital. Mr Rian le Roux, senior
economist at insurance group Old Mutual - the JSE's biggest institutional
investor - says it seems institutions, proscribed from investing abroad,
found themselves relatively underweight in equities as the bull run began.
Given that the JSE is so thinly traded - turnover rose to 7 per cent last
year from 4 per cent in 1992 - share prices received a double whammy' thanks
to new foreign and increased local institutional buying.
Of some solace to local investors stunned by these share ratings is
consensus that the economy is heading for slow but steady growth in 1994
after pulling out of recession in the third quarter last year. Leading
industrial companies emerged from the four-year recession with strong cash
balances, excess capacity, and costs trimmed in a period of relatively quiet
labour relations.
Stockbrokers predict earnings growth of at least 15 per cent in 1994.
However, the slippage in share prices recently shows that sentiment remains
edgy, with worries that US fund managers can withdraw what is for them
relatively small investment in the JSE as quickly as they made it.

FT  20 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Hopes for economic boost
help Nikkei over 19,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Hopes of an imminent announcement of economic stimulus by the government
supported sentiment, and late afternoon buying by foreign and domestic
investors pushed the Nikkei average above the 19,000 level for the first
time since November 2, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue index ended 524.85, or 2.8 per cent, ahead at 19,039.40 after
a day's low of 18,515.65 and high of 19,118.81. The Topix index of all first
section stocks advanced 29.76, or 1.9 per cent, to 1,541.15. In London the
ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 7.02 to 1,280.56.
The Nikkei faced small-lot profit-taking during the early morning. However,
an overnight rise in the Nikkei futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
led the Osaka futures higher, triggering arbitrage buying. The underlying
cash market rebounded on active demand by foreigners and domestic
institutions, also spurring covering of short positions, especially in
banks.
Volume was 400m shares, up from 285m. Rises overwhelmed declines by 933 to
136, with 102 issues unchanged.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange suspended Hanwa stocks after reports of the
president's resignation. Market participants, however, said the suspension
had little effect on the stock market. Hanwa, known for its extensive
financial investments during the late 1980s, yesterday announced the
resignation of Mr Shigeru Kita, its president. The TSE later declared that
it would start an insider trading investigation on dealings in Hanwa shares,
which have been moving erratically recently.
The expected passage of the political reform bill through the upper house
encouraged hopes of the government's announcement of an economic stimulus
package, and an income tax cut which has faced delays due to the political
situation. Banks were higher in active trading. Sumitomo Bank gained Y90 at
Y2,100 and Industrial Bank of Japan Y70 at Y2,970.
The rise in Nippon Telegraph and Telephone for the 15th consecutive day
encouraged investors. The issue climbed Y5,000 to Y844,000.
Oki Electric rose Y24 to a new high of Y608, as did Sony, which advanced
Y100 to Y5,930.
In Osaka, the OSE average added 313.02 at 20,914.02 in volume of 36.5m
shares. Rohm, a semiconductor device maker, moved ahead Y110 to Y3,570 on
active buying.
Roundup
Pacific Rim markets moved in sharply divergent directions.
HONG KONG closed markedly higher amid optimism on bank results and Hong Kong
Telecom's share price prospects.
The Hang Seng index finished 346.08, or 3.1 per cent, ahead at 11,363.77,
off a late high of 11,400.39 as the vice-chairman of Nomura International,
Mineo Murai, said Japanese investment in Hong Kong stocks was likely to rise
in 1994 on the back of optimism over China's economic growth. Turnover
remained moderate, at HKDollars 8.42bn against Tuesday's adjusted HKDollars
8.79bn.
MANILA surged 5.2 per cent on the strength of blue chips, which were boosted
by gains in other Asian markets. The composite index added 151.31 at
3,062.28.
PLDT, Dollars 1 3/4 higher at Dollars 74 1/4 overnight in New York,
appreciated 100 pesos to 2,180 pesos.
TAIWAN finished slightly higher after a late wave of buying focused on the
heavily weighted financial sector. The weighted index, which opened easier
and hit a low of 5,796, closed 33.90 ahead at 5,910.33.
Turnover, however, fell to TDollars 70.94bn from Tuesday's TDollars 98.83bn
as many buyers remained cautious, unsure whether the market's downtrend had
ended.
AUSTRALIA overcame early falls to close at a new post-1987 crash high as
investors chased leading stocks. The advance was attributed to a shortage of
scrip in a number of stocks and stronger overseas markets.
The All Ordinaries index, down 3.3 points in the morning, ended 16.1 up at
2,248.2.
SEOUL continued to rise on the back of healthy demand for blue chips, which
have recovered nearly 70 per cent of the loss which followed government
market-cooling steps last Friday. The composite stock index put on 14.10 at
887.16, but low-priced shares continued to tumble on worries of worsening
liquidity.
SINGAPORE was nudged higher by selective institutional buying, but overall
sentiment remains cautious after recent declines. The Straits Times
Industrial index rose 22.89, or 1 per cent, to 2,303.30.
JAKARTA firmed in moderate trading as local investors focused on
large-capitalisation stocks. The market index gained 3.98 at 595.99.
BOMBAY steadied in late trading after a 3.2 per cent fall during the
official session as local investors and financial institutions continued
selling and overseas funds cut back on buying. The BSE 30 index lost 125.11
at 3,825.91.
KUALA LUMPUR fell 2.6 per cent in thin trade as investors remained wary
after the recent volatility. The composite index shed 28.44 to 1,081.78.
BANGKOK weakened 1.2 per cent in thin trading as profit-taking more than
wiped out early gains, with local funds hesitant to adopt new strategies
while foreign institutional funds continue to sell. The SET index dipped
17.29 to 1,459.74 in modest turnover of Bt11.99bn.
SHANGHAI A shares finished sharply lower and brokers predicted that the
slide would continue as institutions bailed out of the market. The A index
dropped 27.64 to 825.60 in a market driven by more rumours than usual: it
was even suggested that stock exchange president Wei Wenyunn was about to
submit his resignation.

FT  20 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Continent fuelled by rate cut
optimism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hopes for Europe-wide rate cuts coloured yesterday's trading, writes Our
Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT pulled itself out of a downward path, helped by short-covering
ahead of tomorrow's futures expiry and some speculation that the Bundesbank
might reduce interest rates at its meeting today. However, most market
commentators do not expect a move given the growth in M3.
The DAX index rose 20.54 to 2,134.38, almost recouping all of Tuesday's
decline. In the post-bourse the Ibex index was little changed, while
turnover settled at DM10bn.
The chemical sector came into play helped by a positive note issued recently
by Nomura which forecast that BASF, Hoechst, Bayer and Degussa were 'due a
big year' given that 'restructuring measures, which have been executed, mean
that profits are highly leveraged to any improvements in volumes or prices'.
Nomura added that the chemicals sector had started to outperform the DAX,
but still lagged by an average of 5 per cent a year. Degussa rose DM13.50 to
DM464.00, also helped by a buy note from Bank Julius Bar, BASF by DM5.10 to
DM294.70, Hoechst by DM3.80 to DM304.30 and Bayer by DM6.70 to DM356.50.
ZURICH returned to record territory, helped by the strength of the dollar
against the D-mark, the inflation outlook after good figures from Basle on
Tuesday and the potential for lower interest rates. The SMI index rose 11.9
to 3,049.4.
Industrials led the gains. Sulzer certificates added SFr43 to SFr925 on the
view that the issue had become cheap relative to the market.
Swissair, also viewed as a recent laggard, put on SFr20 to SFr860.
SMH continued to pick up after recent declines, adding SFr19 to SFr1,025 on
renewed speculation about its Swatch car project. However, the company
declined to comment on press speculation about a potential partner.
AMSTERDAM moved ahead helped by strength in neighbouring markets, with the
AEX index rising 2.17 to 427.33.
KLM went up over 5 per cent, gaining Fl 2.30 to Fl 46.30, in reaction to
news that it will maintain its 20 per cent stake in the ordinary share
capital of Northwest Airlines through a share swap. Unexpectedly strong
trade was also seen in Philips whose shares improved Fl 1.80 or 4 per cent
to Fl 46.60.
PARIS captured the mood with a day's gain of 1.2 per cent in the CAC-40,
closing 27.33 higher at 2,274.67.
Turnover was steady at FFr5bn. St Gobain went against the trend, down FFr6
at FFr624, ahead of preliminary 1993 figures today. Elf Aquitaine continued
firm, up FFr10 to FFr418, with reports that Suez was seeking a stake in the
oil group.
MILAN was little changed after the firm trend of the previous two sessions
and the Comit index registered a dip of just 0.05 to 617.35.8.
Mr James Cornish of NatWest Securities, noted that with general elections
set for March 27, market volatility was likely to increase as the
implications of the current deep divisions of the centre-right became
clearer.
He recommended using dips in the index to increase market weightings with a
view to ending the election period with a 1.2 percentage point overweight
position in Italy of 8.7 per cent in a European, ex-UK portfolio.
Industrials were in demand on hopes that they would lead recovery. CIR put
on L49 to L1,920 and Fiat added L39 to L4,439 in spite of an eight hour
strike against job cuts.
MADRID sprinted to a record close with investment funds playing a central
role in pushing the market higher. The general index added 4.87 or 1.4 per
cent to 343.23 in volume of Pta47bn.
STOCKHOLM resumed its rally and the Affarsvarlden index rose 14.4 to a
record 1,559.5.
Volvo B bucked the trend as profits were taken after their recent strong
performance and ahead of the special shareholders's meeting later in the
day. The shares finished SKr8 lower at SKr657, after a day's low of SKr638.
COPENHAGEN reacted modestly to the central bank's cut in interest rates, the
KFX index up 0.99 to 116.16 in turnover of DKr1.6bn. The bank cut key rates
by 0.25 percentage points to 5.75 per cent - the tenth reduction in five
months.
ATHENS lost some 2 per cent as investors took profits after the market's
steady upward rise in recent sessions. The general index closed down 24.48
at 1,170.10.

FT  20 JAN 94 / Markets Report: Sales data knock pound
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Trading in currency markets was dominated yesterday by the pound, which lost
ground across the board. The release of weaker than expected economic
figures prompted speculation about an early reduction in interest rates,
writes Philip Gawith.
The combination of subdued December retail sales figures and confirmation of
a benign inflationary environment convinced the market that a rate cut had
become more likely.
The interest rate expectations were reflected in other financial markets. In
the futures market, after opening at 94.74, the March short sterling
contract rose 11 basis points to trade at a high of 94.85 before falling
back in late trading to 94.81.
After closing on Tuesday at DM2.618, the pound fell below the DM2.60 level
in early trading. Later it moved above DM2.6050, before falling back to
finish in London nearly 1 3/4 pfennigs down on the day at DM2.6016.
Mr Peter Luxton of Barclays said sterling had been 'trashed' on the back of
the numbers and the easier inflationary background, bringing to an end the
currency's rise against the D-Mark from DM2.54 in mid-December to above
DM2.62 last week. 'The negative side of the pound is now coming much more to
the fore.' added Mr Luxton.
Although December's seasonally adjusted 0.2 per cent fall in retail sales
was unexpected, the currency's pull-back was not a complete surprise, with
analysts viewing sterling at DM2.62 as 'frothy'.
The pound also started weaker against the dollar, slipping to Dollars 1.49
in morning trading after Tuesday's close of Dollars 1.4972. It finished the
day at Dollars 1.4918.
The government warned, however, that the market should not link any future
interest rate cut to sterling's strength alone. Mr Stephen Dorrell,
financial secretary to the Treasury, said: 'We shall watch the exchange rate
but we shall also watch a number of domestic indicators, and we shall set
interest rates in the light of all those indicators.'
Continued pessimism about the framework trade talks between the US and Japan
put downward pressure on the dollar in early trading. US Treasury Secretary
Lloyd Bentsen was quoted as voicing deep concern about the lack of progress
in the talks.
The dollar eased against the yen in early London trading to Y110.50 from the
overnight London close of Y110.75. However, after the release of better than
anticipated trade data, the currency firmed to end in London at Y110.89.
Against the D-Mark the dollar traded in a narrow range all day, with
investors unwilling to take big positions ahead of today's Bundesbank
council meeting. The dollar ended at DM1.744, down from Tuesday's London
close of DM1.7487. In a Reuters poll, 64 per cent of analysts predicted that
the Bundesbank would not cut rates. The majority expect a cut next month. In
New York the dollar closed at DM1.7455 and Y111.40.
The Danish crown weakened against the D-Mark after Denmark's central bank
lowered its discount and key deposit rates to 5.75 per cent from 6 per cent
on Tuesday. It closed at DKr3.885, compared to Tuesday's Dkr3.877.
The rouble continued its recent plunge following the departure from
government of the reformist minister Mr Yegor Gaidar. The Russian unit fell
yesterday on the St Petersburg Interbank Currency Exchange to 1,627 to the
dollar, from 1,527 on Tuesday, moving below Moscow's record low of 1,607
roubles to the dollar.
The Bank of England yesterday announced its first regular sale and
repurchase facility, which will put Pounds 3.979bn of liquidity into the
market, of which Pounds 3.842bn will be provided in the three-week repo
expiring on February 10 and Pounds 137m in a five-week repo expiring on
February 24. The interest rate of 5 13/32 per cent on the repos is the same
rate currently offered on repos in the course of the Bank's daily money
market operations.
The new arrangements replace a temporary facility in place since September
1992. The Bank introduced the arrangements to help relieve large money
market shortages and reduce short-term interest rate volatility. The new
facility showed evidence of success by raising nearly Pounds 0.5bn more than
the temporary facility, which was about Pounds 3.5bn, and attracting more
players.
Money market sources said the sudden rush of rate cut speculation was the
reason why the shorter-dated facility was larger than the longer facility.
Investors did not want to lock into fixed rate funding at current levels
when there was a chance they might fall soon.
The Bank has indicated that it plans to use the regular facility to 'rough'
tune the shortage, while normal money market operations will be used for
'fine' tuning purposes. Accordingly, the Bank is more likely to send
interest rate signals to the market through its daily operations rather than
through the regular facility. The larger the sums dealt with through the
regular facility, the greater the Bank's scope for fine tuning monetary
policy through its daily activities.
Yesterday was a tight day in the UK money markets, with overnight rates
rising from 5 7/8 per cent at the start of trading to above 7 per cent by
noon, with the Bank providing limited early assistance. The Bank provided
the market with around Pounds 760m of late, unspecified assistance, bringing
total help over the day to Pounds 1.137bn, against a shortage of Pounds
1.3bn.

FT  20 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Australian farmers enjoying
bumper year
</HEADLINE>

   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Australian grain farmers are seeing record or near-record production in the
1993-94 season, thanks to favourable spring growing conditions outside of
Queensland, an increase in the area planted, and some 'excellent' harvest
weather.
According to the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics,
total winter crop production is forecast to be 29.4m tonnes, only 700,000
tonnes less than the record grain harvest seen in 1983-84. This figure
compares with the estimated 26m tonnes harvested last year.
Mr Chrys Papadopoulos, Abare's crop and livestock economics branch manager,
said that this should result in higher farm incomes, despite the likely
reduction in average returns for wheat and barley.
The country's wheat crop is estimated to be about 18.2m tonnes - up from
16.2m tonnes last year but still well short of the 22m tonnes harvested in
1983-84.
However, the area sown this year, at 9.5m hectares, was significantly
smaller than 1983-84's 12.9m hectares, indicating a much higher yield. The
barley crop is forecast to be 6.8m tonnes, nearly 1.3m tonnes more than last
year's record crop.

FT  20 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Pakistan's textile producers
call for halt to cotton exports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FARHAN BOKHARI
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LAHORE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Pakistan's largest textile manufacturing association, the All Pakistan
Textile Manufacturers' Association, is urging an immediately halt to cotton
exports as a step to prevent further shortfalls of raw material after this
season's crop losses.
The association estimates that only 8m bales of cotton will be produced this
year, down from an earlier crop target of 12m bales. That level of
production would be 1m bales below the local industry's requirement.
Mr Tariq Saigol, chairman of APTMA has urged the government to cancel export
orders for 500,000 bales of cotton, by either declaring force majeure and
fulfilling export commitments out of next year's crop, or by just paying
penalties if contracts have to be cancelled.
'It would be strange if we export cotton and then import it for our
industrial needs,' he said.
Mr Saigol has also urged the government to lower interest rates, which are
at present around 22 per cent, as a step towards easing financial pressure
on the textile industry.
In addition, he demanded a free float of the rupee to bridge a gap of about
5 per cent between official and open market rates as a way to encourage
exports.
The latest demands from APTMA follow a year-long recession in the local
textile industry, where the association claims that manufacturers have been
forced to take to out of operation 1.2m spindles out of a total of 6.5m
because of continuing losses.
According to Mr Saigol, another 500,000 spindles would be at a risk of
closure in the coming months unless the government announced new relief
measures.
Many economists see the textile industry's troubles as a major test for
Pakistan's efforts to boost its exports. Almost 58 per cent of the country's
export earnings are generated by sales of cotton products.
'Our whole structure of the economy is too heavily dependent on textiles.
The textile sector needs to be revamped and revived,' said Mr Saigol.

FT  20 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Hopes of success grow at
Brussels aluminium talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Expectations of a substantial co-ordinated cut in worldwide aluminium
production increased yesterday after trade delegates from the main producing
countries decided to continue their negotiations into an unscheduled third
day.
'We decided we would keep talking while we were still making progress,' said
one delegate.
However, there were some indications that the talks were taking longer than
the two days originally scheduled because of Russia's determination not to
shift from its opening offer.
Delegates were concentrating on how cuts of up to 2m tonnes a year of annual
output could be shared between Russia and the rest of the world. A sudden
surge in Russian exports to the west following a collapse in domestic
demand, which had been largely for its military machine, is widely blamed
for the aluminium surplus, which has driven down prices recently to all-time
lows in real terms.
Taking part in the negotiations with Russia are trade representatives from
Australia, Canada, the 12-nation European Union as one body, Norway and the
US.
As an incentive to the Russia, second only to the US as an aluminium
producer, to co-operate, the western governments are offering financial and
technical help to the Russian industry.
On the other hand, if no agreement is reached, US producers are likely
immediately to make anti-dumping charges against the Russian industry.
However, this process might take a year to complete.
The EU already has imposed import restrictions on aluminium from the
Commonwealth of Independent States which last until the end of February.

FT  20 JAN 94 / World Commodities Prices: Coffee futures plunge - Market
Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Speculative selling in the New York market sparked off a COFFEE price plunge
yesterday afternoon that took London futures values to the lowest levels
since the end of October. The March position dipped to Dollars 1,169 a tonne
at the close, down Dollars 34 on the day.
Traders said there was little fresh news in the market to warrant such a
move, but having failed to break out on the upside, disappointed longs had
liquidated. 'It's looking tired,' said one, 'and some stale longs have
decided to get out.'
Others said the fall had been exacerbated by the lack of roaster demand on
the way down.
At the London Metal Exchange COPPER and ZINC prices opened sharply higher
but came under increasing pressure as the day progressed.
A chart break-out at New York's Commodity Exchange (Comex) late on Tuesday
sent the copper market soaring and at one stage the three months position
reached a four month high of Dollars 1,912 a tonne, over 10 per cent up this
year and 18.5 per cent above its 1993 low. But with analysts and chartists
warning that the rise was becoming over-extended and with Comex falling
back, prices dropped during the afternoon before last kerb business at
Dollars 1,882, still up Dollars 24 a tonne from Tuesday's close.
Zinc had continued Tuesday's rise but ran into resistance near Dollars 1,050
a tonne and settled back to a final trade at Dollars 1,030 a tonne, down
Dollars 12 on balance.
ALUMINIUM prices lost more ground as news was awaited from the Brussels
talks on cutting oversupply.

FT  20 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Japanese crop setback may
herald new rice age
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European consumers will soon be paying at least 15 per cent more for rice
because of poor harvests and crop failures in the main producing countries,
most notably Japan.
The United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organisation estimates that the
Japanese harvest fell by about 25 per cent last year to 9.7m tonnes, and
this has forced the government to import huge amounts of rice to its
previously closed market.
Heavy demand from such an important rice consumer has triggered a near
doubling in international prices since September, fuelled by smaller
supplies than usual being available from some other big producing countries.
'I've been in this trade for 30 years and I've never seen a year quite like
the one we've had,' said Mr Danny Driscoll, director in charge of rice at UK
food trader Stevens &amp; Brotherton, which has seen a 110 per cent increase in
the price of its unmilled US long grain rice to Dollars 440 a tonne. 'But
then, Japan has never come into the market before.'
Japan announced in September that typhoons and a cold summer would force it
to import at least 1m tonnes of rice. The international rice industry now
estimates that it may be in the market for up to 3m tonnes.
Rice supply and demand have tended to be fairly stable in recent years. But
the rash of bad harvests has upset everyone's calculations.
Crops in China, India, North Korea and the Philippines were hit last year by
exceptionally wet or stormy weather, while cool conditions affected the
South Korean crop. In Europe, the Spanish crop was down by about one-third
because of severe dry weather in the Seville region.
The FAO estimates that world output of paddy rice fell to about 520m tonnes,
6m tonnes less than the record harvest in 1992. It predicts that, as a
result, world trade in rice will rise to an all-time high of at least 14.6m
tonnes this year, some 800,000 tonnes more than last year.
The type of rice favoured by Japanese consumers is high quality short-grain
Japonica rice, grown mainly in the US and Australia apart from Japan. But
the industry believes that its requirements far exceed available exports and
that it will have to consider buying long grain Indica rices from the US and
from Thailand.
According to the FAO, Japan bought 200,000 tonnes in early October,
contracted for further amounts for delivery in December and has confirmed
that it will import 900,000 tonnes in the first quarter of this year.
'Although no indications were given on the volume to be imported after
March, it would appear that substantial quantities may still be needed to
cover the shortfall,' the FAO said.
There has been no let-up in the rise in world prices and buyers are running
out of the stocks they bought in advance to protect against sudden price
changes. As the new US crop arrives on the European market, consumers are
next in line to feel the squeeze.
In addition to the world rice price, European consumers are affected by a
levy on rice imports into the European Union. When world prices rise, the
levies are meant to fall, to keep prices stable. But the rise of at least 80
per cent in world prices has so far been met by a fall in import levies of
only about 12.5 per cent and the industry wants the European Commission to
reduce them further.
Tilda Rice, a leading brand rice manufacturer, is raising its prices of
American long grain rice by 15-20 per cent this month in the UK and
continental European markets and says there may be further increases later
in the year.
'It's a very moveable feast; 3m tonnes is a hell of a lot to mop up,' said
Mr Tim Smith, Tilda marketing controller. 'It depends where Japan does
finally source all its requirements. If a huge proportion of that shortfall
has to be taken up from the US that puts extra cost pressures on rice from
the US, and the same goes for Thailand.'
Mr Smith said that if Japanese consumers developed a taste for imported
long-grain rice, which cost three or four times less to produce than
domestically-grown Japanese rice, they could push international prices
higher still.
'We could be at the start of a new rice age,' of rising prices, he warned.

FT  20 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Argentine officials sacked over
disease outbreak
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Argentina's agriculture department has sacked top officials at the Senasa
animal health service for incompetence in allowing an outbreak of
foot-and-mouth disease in Patagonia, a region that had been declared free of
the disease.
The department promises it will be 'absolutely inflexible' to halt the
region's worst outbreak of foot and mouth in 20 years. Senasa has already
ordered the killing of 9,000 cattle and sheep since the disease was first
notified at the end of December.
Senasa specialists say that they have disinfected and quarantined 50 small
farms in a 20km radius around the tourist city of Bariloche and ordered the
vaccination of 60,000 animals.
However, a Senasa official claimed the problem was like a 'drop in a huge
lake. There are 13m animals in this region and they are healthy'.
Among the properties worst affected was Mr Lucio Benetton's Pilcaneu farm,
where the government ordered the slaughter of almost 10 per cent of its
27,000 sheep.
Senasa believes the outbreak started at a small farm near Bariloche, where
pigs may have been infected by illegal feeds. An official said the disease
spread rapidly because 'there has been a tremendous growth in tourism and a
big increase in cattle movements to meet demand'.
However, the Agriculture department suspects that lax controls at Senasa
allowed the foot-and-mouth virus to travel south from the country's infected
northern region.
The government has spent about Dollars 400m since 1989 on a campaign to rid
Argentina of the disease.

FT  20 JAN 94 / Government Bonds: Long gilts rally on renewed hopes of early
cut in base rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE and TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK government bonds rallied more than one point at the long end following
the release of weaker-than-expected retail sales and inflation data for
December, which revived speculation of an early cut in interest rates.
News that the public spending borrowing requirement last month was Pounds
2.11bn - well below the consensus market forecast of Pounds 5.1bn - also
fuelled the market's rally.
'The data have put the market on a more confident footing,' said Mr Julian
Callow, international economist at Kleinwort Benson. He added that the
market could be further encouraged by the release tomorrow of preliminary
gross domestic product data for the fourth quarter and December money supply
figures.
The March long gilt future on Liffe rose as high as 120 13/32 but slipped to
119 29/32 in late trading, up  7/8 on the day.
Hopes of a rate cut also lifted the short end where the March short-term
Eurosterling future rose to 94.81 from 94.73.
German government bonds and futures came off the day's highs yesterday as
traders took the view that the Bundesbank would not cut official interest
rates after its fortnightly council meeting today. Analysts added that
nervousness over the situation in Russia and elections in Germany this year
also hung over the market.
The Liffe March bund future traded at 100.58 late in the day in brisk volume
of 141,357 lots, below the day's high of 100.90 and down 0.13 point from
Tuesday's close.
Encouraging industrial production data for November contributed to the firm
tone in the French government bond market, prompting a further narrowing of
the yield differential between 10-year French and German government bonds to
less than two basis points.
Talk of an interest rate cut in France independent of Germany also supported
the market. The March 10-year future settled at 131.12, up 0.10 point on the
day in volume of 181,470 lots.
News that Italian treasury minister Mr Piero Barucci had signed a decree
regarding the refund of a 12.5 per cent withholding tax on bond coupon
payments to eligible non-residents lifted Italian bond futures yesterday.
The March futures contract on Liffe opened at 118.90 and went as high as
119.12, but failed to stay above the 119 chart resistance point for long. It
settled back at 118.80 in late trading, giving a gain of 0.3 point on the
day. Trading volume was moderate at 65,412 contracts.
Mr Marco Pianelli, southern European economist at Nomura in London, said
that the market's upside had been limited by the political uncertainty ahead
of the country's general election in March.
However, he added that the release tomorrow of favourable preliminary
inflation figures for January could provide the bond market with fresh
impetus.
Japanese government bond futures fell to their lowest close since November
25 as market sentiment remained bearish. The March futures contract closed
at 114.68, down from 114.95 on Tuesday.
The 30-year US Treasury benchmark bond fell  3/8 of a point in thin trading
yesterday as the market returned to the nervous mood of recent days, taking
the yield up to just under 6.3 per cent.
The release of the Federal Reserve's 'Beige Book', assessing the pace of
economic growth, was the immediate excuse for the sell-off, though there was
little to raise fears of higher interest rates. While noting that growth was
accelerating in some sectors, the Fed said there were few signs that
inflationary pressures were growing.
A Treasury announcement that it would sell Dollars 17bn of two-year notes
and Dollars 12bn of five-year notes was in line with market expectations.
Shorter-dated issues proved more robust, with the 10-year note off only for
a yield of 5.7 per cent.

Trading volume on the Budapest stock exchange rose by 450 per cent to
Ft186bn (Dollars 1.85bn) in 1993 while the value of the market more than
doubled to Ft441.8bn, the exchange said in its annual report.
Government bonds and treasury bills made up the bulk of trading, accounting
for 69 per cent of market value at the year-end. The capitalisation of
Hungarian shares rose sharply in the last few months, closing 73 per cent
higher at Ft81.7bn.
The upsurge in equity values was helped by a wave of new issues which lifted
the number of listed shares from 23 in January to 28 by December. The
exchange expects a further eight to 10 flotations during 1994.
Last year the exchange installed a VAX-based computer trading system and
also set up a central clearing house and depository.

FT  20 JAN 94 / International Bonds: SEK offers Swedish krone Eurobond
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Swedish Export Credit's (SEK) latest offering - the first global Swedish
krone Eurobond - was the focus of the market yesterday, while the day's
other feature was a flurry of structured floating-rate note issues, mostly
in US dollars.
SEK issued SKr2.5bn of 6.5 per cent bonds due June 2001, which were priced
to yield 11 basis points over the 13 per cent Swedish government benchmark
bond at the re-offer price of 99.359.
The deal met strong demand from investors in the US and Europe, according to
a syndicate official at lead manager Merrill Lynch.
Towards the end of the day, the bonds were trading at 99.40 bid, the yield
gap having narrowed to 10 basis points.
'People are very positive on the krone market: they expect the currency to
appreciate; they like the yield pick-up over other European markets; and
they hope that yields will decline further as interest rates continue
getting cut,' said a trader at another bank, who reported keen interest in
the paper.
Others felt the bond's pricing was on the tight side, compared with some
outstanding SEK krone Eurobonds which yield around 30 basis points over
government bonds. However, global bonds tend to be more tightly priced as
they are considered to be more liquid and usually have a wider investor
base.
SEK also issued Dollars 100m of one-year so-called 'corridor,' or range,
floating-rate notes, a structure where interest only accrues when
three-month Libor falls within a specific range during certain dates.
Yesterday's other range-floaters included Dollars 75m of one-year notes for
Rabobank Nederland via Goldman Sachs; Dollars 150m of two-year notes for
Canada's Export Development Corporation via Swiss Bank Corporation; Dollars
100m of two-year notes for Osterreichische Postsparkasse via SBC; Dollars
100m of two-year notes for the World Bank via Morgan Stanley; and Dollars
150m of two-year notes for UBS, via UBS.
'Structured floaters have become the flavour of the month - they're likely
to take over from collared FRNs,' said one trader. Collared floaters are
structured so that the coupon range is limited by a floor and a ceiling
rate.
The structure of most corridor floaters implies that investors take the view
that short-term US interest rates will not be very volatile, and that if
they rise, they will do so only very slowly, the trader said.
'If you call interest rates right, you can get very nice returns; of course,
if you don't, you get nothing,' said another dealer. He added that these
relatively highly leveraged instruments have seen strong demand from
institutional investors and money market fund managers, who are taking an
increasingly aggressive approach to their portfolios in the current
low-yield environment.
In the dollar sector, Mexico's Banco Nacional de Comercio Exterior
(Bancomext) is set to launch its Dollars 1bn 10-year global offering via
Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs today. The bonds are expected to be launched
at a spread of 155-165 basis points over Treasuries.
In the sterling market, the European Investment Bank is expected to issue
Pounds 300m-Pounds 400m 10-year bonds today.
While the pricing is expected to be tight and the 10-year sector of the
Eurosterling market is weighed down with recent supply, the bonds are
expected to meet with solid demand from institutional and multi-currency
investors.
Elsewhere, the City of Prague was awarded an implied triple-B senior debt
rating with a positive outlook by Standard &amp; Poor's - the first investment
grade rating for a municipality in central Europe. The rating comes as
Prague prepares its entry into the Eurobond market.
According to the city's mayor, Mr Jan Koukal, 'obtaining a rating was an
important step in the implementation of our international borrowing plans.
We will now focus on obtaining cost-effective and diversified financing.'
Pending approval by the city's governing general assembly, Prague is
expected to tap the market in the next two months, with market talk focusing
on a Dollars 200m-Dollars 250m issue of five-year bonds.
Nomura International, which acted as Prague's rating adviser, is among the
banks tipped to lead-manage the issue.

Ajinomoto, the Japanese pharmaceuticals, chemicals and food additives
company, yesterday signed an agreement with Sandoz to license a diabetes
treatment to the Swiss drugs group.
The move demonstrates the increasing productivity and sophistication of
Japanese drugs research.
Sandoz will pay a licence fee of at least Y1bn (Dollars 9m), as well as
royalties equivalent to about 10 per cent of sales. The Basle-based group
has acquired the rights to develop and market the drug.
Ajinomoto hopes the compound could be marketed in Japan as early as 1998 and
eventually generate world-wide annual sales of Y50bn. Of these, 40 per cent
would be domestic.
World-wide sales of diabetic drugs were about Dollars 2.5bn in 1992 and
growing at about 10 per cent a year, according to Lehman Brothers, the
international securities company.
Others developing or marketing similar drugs include Hoechst of Germany, and
Upjohn and Pfizer of the US.
Ajinomoto's sales of drugs, amino acids and speciality chemicals were
Y93.7bn in 1992, compared with a group turnover of Y667bn. The company is
one of a number of Japanese groups that have diversified into
pharmaceuticals in recent years.

FT  20 JAN 94 / International Company News: WMC may appeal over Seabright
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Western Mining Corporation (WMC), the large Australian mining house, said
yesterday it was considering an appeal to the Canadian Supreme Court, after
the Nova Scotia appeal court decided not to overturn an earlier judgment
against WMC over the acquisition of Seabright, a Nova Scotia exploration
company.
It is the latest of several legal setbacks for WMC.
WMC, via a subsidiary, bought Seabright in 1987 for around CDollars 92m
(USDollars 70m), as part of push into North America. However, within weeks
of completing the acquisition, WMC described Seabright's Beaver Dam deposit,
thought to be one of its most promising assets, as hopeless. By 1989, the
Australian company had halted Seabright's operations and written off its
investment.
WMC proceeded to sue Seabright's president, Mr Terence Coughlan, and other
directors, for alleged fraud and negligence. They counter-sued WMC,
levelling a variety of charges, including abuse of process.
Last year, Mr Justice Merlin Nunn, in the Nova Scotia Trial Division,
delivered a judgment which was scathing of WMC's behaviour. He duly ordered
the it to pay damages and costs, expected to exceed CDollars 10m, to the
president and six former directors of Seabright.
Yesterday, in the wake of the appeal court's decision, WMC said it still
believed that its case had merit, and was 'considering an appeal to the
Supreme Court of Canada'.
The Seabright affair has been only one of several costly legal debacles for
WMC, one of Australia's largest mining companies, in recent months. It was
forced to hand over the valuable Ernest Henry copper/gold deposit to Savage
Resources in an out-of-court settlement after WMC's exploration team
trespassed on a lease area, and then failed to advise Savage of its work.
And, last November, WMC and Ord Minnett paid ADollars 20m to settle a case
in which it was alleged that a report by the Australian stockbroker -
stating that WMC's sale of a 50 per cent interest in the Lady Bountiful gold
mine was 'fair and reasonable' - was negligent. The payment, to a small
exploration company called Consolidated Exploration, which had sold the
stake to WMC, was split between the two firms.

FT  20 JAN 94 / International Company News: Lower gold price helps cut
income at Gengold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MATTHEW CURTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Gengold, the gold mining division of South Africa's Gencor group, has turned
in a 7 per cent decline in after-tax income to R109.2m (Dollars 31.9m) in
the December quarter, compared with R117.2m in the September period and
R65.1m a year ago.
A combination of a lower gold price, depressed by outstanding low-priced
forward sales contracts, and a small increase in working costs, dulled a
good operating performance from most of the group's 10 producing gold mines.
Total gold output was unchanged at 16.7 tonnes, but the mines received an
average gold price of R37,995 a kg, well below a spot price of R40,867 a kg
for the quarter and lower than the previous quarter's R38,522 a kg.
Mr Gary Maude, managing director, said all the group's forward positions
would be unwound by May exposing the mines fully to the current gold price.
He said the 'star performer' was St Helena which had recovered strongly
after its mining operations were halved in 1992/3 in a last-ditch attempt to
stay in business.
Increasingly efficient underground mining led to higher tonnage, grades and
gold output in addition to trimmed average working costs. After-tax profit
jumped to R11.7m from R6.91m.
The only poor news came from Buffelsfontein, the group's biggest gold
producer, which Mr Maude said had only three-and-half years of underground
reserves at current gold prices.
The mine's gold output would be boosted by the end of the year by a new
retreatment project, which would tackle more than 50m tonnes of dump
material and keep the mine's mills turning over until the year 2010.
Mr Maude said a decision on whether the R1.8bn developing Oryx mine would
close or be able to raise R900m to see it to commissioning would be made in
December.

FT  20 JAN 94 / International Company News: Threat to friendship of
convenience - MIM's network of investments and commercial ties needs and
overhaul
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If the Metallgesellschaft rescue plan, agreed last weekend, resolved the
immediate future of the German metals group, it did nothing to erase
question marks hanging over Brisbane-based MIM Holdings.
The two companies have been bound together for over a decade, by share
stakes in each other and a number of jointly-held commercial interests. From
MIM's point of view, the relationship has formed part of a broader network
of cross-holdings. The aim was partly defensive, as protection against
corporate raiders, and partly commercial, to foster its 'international
development'.
For example, via its relationship with Metallgesellschaft and with the
Germans' Metall Mining subsidiary in Canada, MIM acquired an interest in
Cominco, the Canadian natural resources group. Today, MIM's directly-owned
stake in Cominco stands at 8.7 per cent. It is also an equal partner with
Canada's Teck Corporation in an investment company, called Nunachiaq, which
owns another 27.7 per cent.
The problem is that this 'investment' strategy, debatable from the outset,
has looked increasingly mis-directed. Sizeable sums - over ADollars 1.4bn
(USDollars 975m) at the last balance sheet date - have been tied up in such
holdings, but returns have been paltry. In 1992/3, for example, investment
interests contributed just ADollars 32m to net profits; in the previous
year, under ADollars 44m.
Such lack of performance has come to matter more, as MIM's core base metals
business has struggled in the face of depressed prices and recessionary
conditions. In 1992/3, the group's net profit slipped by 30 per cent to
ADollars 74m, and yesterday's results showed a further loss of ADollars
18.5m. Admittedly, the latest deficit was largely due to a ADollars 17.8m
abnormal item, and MIM did note a tentative recovery in metal prices late in
the quarter. Even so, at the pre-tax level, profit was ADollars 31.6m, less
than one-third of last time's ADollars 97.2m.
Debt, by contrast, has been rising; long-term loans topped ADollars 1.8bn at
end-June. MIM's credit ratings are only within the investment grade range;
Standard &amp; Poor's gives a 'BBB' assessment.
So when financial pressures forced Metallgesellschaft to place the bulk of
its 13.9 per cent stake in MIM last month, the spotlight turned on MIM's
general investment strategy. Stockbrokers ANZ McCaughan said: 'Unless MIM
can increase the return . . . in the near future, the investments should be
sold.'
In response, MIM has given every signal that it recognises the problem, and
would like to do something about it. At the November annual meeting, the
company told shareholders 'quite simply, we must make your money work
better'. Norm Fussell, MIM's chief executive, added that all assets were
under review, a line which the company has continued to repeat.
Even before Metallgesellschaft's upheavals, MIM had started to disentangle
some of the German commercial ties. A restructuring scheme for the
jointly-held zinc smelting interests was devised, so that both companies
would end up with full ownership of specific assets. Some smaller financial
investments have also been sold, including a 12.4 per cent interest in Evans
Deakin, an Australian engineering business, and a 2.4 per cent holding in
Renison Goldfields.
But, in dollar terms, these interests were never the main ones. Of the
ADollars 1.4bn 'investment' portfolio at end-June, the Asarco,
Cominco/Nunachiaq, Metallgesellschaft holdings accounted for over half.
MIM's 35 per cent interest in Norddeutsche Affinerie, the Hamburg-based
copper group in which Metallgesellschaft holds a similar stake, was valued
at another ADollars 139.9m.
The problem for MIM is that the uncertainties that now surround
Metallgesellschaft, coupled with the depressed metal industry conditions
which have led both Cominco and Asarco into losses for the first nine months
of 1993, make action on these interests a lot more difficult in the
short-run.
The Cominco share price, for example, has tumbled from around ADollars 35 at
end-1989 to some ADollars 20 at present. Asarco is little better, having
dropped from around ADollars 45 to about ADollars 27 over the same period.
There are even some suggestions that the workout at Metallgesellschaft could
lead to a sale of Metall-owned assets - which, in turn, might muddy any
Cominco share disposal situation for MIM. MIM says only that it is too early
for any comment.
And, in the meantime, the Australian group remains vague about whether - or
when - interests, such as the 3.5 per cent Metallgesellschaft holding, might
be need to be revalued. This would be a matter for directors, says the
company; its 'normal' practice is to review holdings on a three-year basis.
However, the Queensland group does add that it sees 'no reason to suppose
that exchange of German smelting interests will not go ahead'.

FT  20 JAN 94 / International Company News: Woolworths on course in
Australia

<TEXT>
Woolworths, the large Australian retailer which floated on the stock market
last year, said yesterday that it was on course to meet its prospectus
forecast of ADollars 188.5m (USDollars 131m) after tax in the year to June
26, writes Nikki Tait.
The reconfirmed forecast, still subject to the results of the annual
stocktake, came as the group reported sales of ADollars 6.1bn for the first
half of the financial year, encompassing the important Christmas period.
This compared with sales of ADollars 5.48bn in the same period of the
previous year.
Woolworths said that 'like-for-like' store sales increased by 11.2 per cent,
with each trading group with the company posting sales improvement well in
excess of the 2 per cent inflation rate. It added that it saw some signs of
'sustainable economic recovery which bode well for the remaining 24 weeks of
our financial year'.
Despite Australia's high unemployment levels, most big retailers are
understood to have had a fairly comfortable Christmas, suggesting that
consumer confidence among the nation's shoppers is finally picking up.

MIM Holdings, the Queensland-based metals group, yesterday announced a loss
of ADollars 18.5m (USDollars 12.8m) in the six months to December 12.
The first-half deficit compares with a surplus of ADollars 71.3m in the same
period the previous year, and was on revenues of ADollars 996.4m against
ADollars 870.9m.
However, it came after items such as an abnormal loss of ADollars 17.8m
relating to MIM's joint venture smelting operations in Germany and a
ADollars 1.2m loss on foreign exchange.
Before these items, MIM posted a small ADollars 7.1m profit, compared with a
ADollars 51.1m surplus in the first half of 1992-3.
The company also saw a better performance in the second quarter, compared
with the first. Net profit before abnormals and foreign exchange in the
second three months stood at ADollars 14m, compared with ADollars 16.6m last
time.
MIM said that average base metal prices received during the six months
remained 'significantly weaker than a year ago, with copper and lead
continuing to deteriorate in the recent quarter and zinc improving'. A
weaker Australian dollar only partially offset this. Overall, the average
Australian dollar price for copper was down by 21 per cent on a year ago.
For lead, prices were down by 20 per cent and for zinc, by 22 per cent.
However, the group also said that sales volumes rose significantly
year-on-year in the first half. Late in the quarter, it also noted an
improvement in metal prices, albeit from very low levels.
MIM stressed that its continuing cost-reduction programme 'remains firmly in
place,' and said it was continuing its review of assets and investments.
On specific projects, MIM said that production at the McArthur River
zinc-lead-silver mining development remained on schedule for 1995, while a
geological drilling programme had been completed on the Ernest Henry
deposit. 'Preliminary results from this indicate that a high-grade
concentrate can be made with good metal recovery from the primary ores,' MIM
said.
Exploration activity remained focused on copper and gold, with expenditure
in the first half totalling ADollars 38m.
Pasminco, the Australian zinc and lead producer, yesterday announced that
group metal production fell during the first half of 1993-4, compared with
the previous year.
Zinc production was down 11 per cent, due to the sale of its Avonmouth
smelter in the UK to MIM Holdings and a scheduled shutdown at Pasminco
Metals-Sulphide.

Faster profits growth at the end of last year at Genentech, the US
biotechnology company, is likely to continue into this year following recent
new drug approvals, Mr Kirk Raab, president and chief executive, said
yesterday.
His projection came as the company reported fourth quarter net income ahead
of market expectations at Dollars 18.7m, or 16 cents a share, compared with
Dollars 6.2m, or 5 cents a share, a year before.
The improved performance came on the back of strong sales growth from
Activase, revenues from which rose 30 per cent to Dollars 236m during the
year, giving it a two-thirds market share in the US. Sales of the company's
other big drug, the human growth hormone Protropin, rose 5 per cent to
Dollars 217m during the year.

FT  20 JAN 94 / International Company News: Pennzoil in Dollars 957m tax
wrangle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pennzoil, the US oil company, has been presented with a tax demand for
Dollars 957m from the Internal Revenue Service over a settlement it received
six years ago after a long-running dispute with Texaco.
The IRS has ruled that Pennzoil should pay tax on the Dollars 2.2bn of the
Dollars 3bn settlement which it invested in shares in another oil company,
Chevron. Pennzoil, which has paid tax on the remaining Dollars 800m, has
always argued that the larger part of the settlement should not be taxed.
Pennzoil said it had received a ruling from the IRS that its 1988 income
should be increased by Dollars 2.2bn. This created a tax deficiency for the
year of Dollars 551m, plus additional after-tax interest of Dollars 234m.
Pennzoil added that the IRS had disallowed Dollars 366m of litigation and
other costs related to the dispute with Texaco, and that this would produce
a tax deficiency of Dollars 125m, plus interest of Dollars 47m.
The company said it continued to dispute the issue, and would appeal. It
added that it had the financial resources necessary to deal with any ruling
that followed. Late last year, Pennzoil sold Dollars 721m of Chevron stock,
prompting speculation that it was building cash reserves in case the IRS
ruling went against it.
The Dollars 3bn settlement followed a dispute over the manner in which
Texaco acquired Getty Oil in the early 1980s, after Pennzoil had already
reached agreement to buy the company.

289m
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Microsoft, the world's largest personal computer software supplier,
yesterday reported a 22 per cent increase in second-quarter net income, from
Dollars 236m to Dollars 289m.
The figures translated into earnings per share of 95 cents, up from 78
cents, and were struck on revenues 20 per cent higher at Dollars 1.22bn.
The results, announced after the market closed, were in line with analysts'
expectations. The consensus Wall Street forecast was for earnings per share
of 93 cents.
Microsoft said several factors contributed to the improvement, including an
enthusiastic response to its newest editions of Microsoft Office in the US,
together with the 'ongoing adoption of the Microsoft Windows operating
system'.
For the six months, Microsoft reported net income of Dollars 528m, or
Dollars 1.74 a share, up from Dollars 445m, or Dollars 1.48, in the same
period of last year. Revenues rose from Dollars 1.76bn to Dollars 2.11bn.
Before the figures were announced, Microsoft shares fell Dollars 1 3/8 to
Dollars 83 1/4 in trading on the Nasdaq market. However, they were quoted in
after-hours trading at Dollars 84 1/8.

McDonald's Corporation, the international hamburger restaurant chain,
intends to buy back Dollars 1bn of common stock within the next three years,
funded primarily by excess cash flow.
Since 1983, the company has bought back stock worth nearly Dollars 2.2bn.
Mr Jack Greenberg, chief financial officer, said the repurchases would
enhance shareholder returns, but would not dent the equity base needed to
support growth worldwide.
McDonald's recently announced it would accelerate its global restaurant
expansion, building 900 to 1,200 new stores annually, with about two-thirds
outside the US.
It currently has 14,000 restaurants in 70 countries, with nearly 80 per cent
independently owned by local franchisees.

FT  20 JAN 94 / International Company News: Globex eyes a Dublin challenge -
The CBoT may join the Irish exchange
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Globex, the troubled global electronic futures exchange, attempts to
relaunch itself later this year, it could face competition from an unlikely
source: a new exchange development in Dublin's International Financial
Services Centre.
So far, only Finex, the relatively small New York-based exchange, has taken
space in the Dublin Exchange Facility, which is due to open on April 15.
But the Chicago Board of Trade is one of a number of exchanges actively
considering the Dublin option, and the Philadelphia Board of Trade and Simex
in Singapore are also involved in discussions.
The facility is 'available for American and Asian exchanges to service
European customers,' said Mr Paul Cronin of Ireland's Industrial Development
Authority, which has backed the project.
The CBoT would be a notable catch for Dublin. The exchange is widely
expected to drop out of Globex, when the contract between the system's three
backers, Reuters, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the CBoT, is redrawn
in April.
Globex is a high-tech, electronic trading network which allows traders in
other time zones to deal in futures outside normal exchange hours. But
volume has been disappointing, prompting speculation that the concept of
24-hour electronic trading is flawed.
The Dublin idea takes a different stab at the same problem of out-of-hours
trading. But unlike Globex, the Dublin facility will simply replicate
existing open-outcry trading arrangements, allowing pit trading in the
European time-zone with low overheads.
'We have a contractual agreement for Globex with Reuters, but, come April,
it is unlikely that we will meet the (contract) requirement, and Reuters has
the option to pull the plug,' explains Mr Fred Grede, vice-president of
administration at the CBoT.
'The board is aware of that and has been thinking about other options.'
He added that the Dublin development is 'definitely an option - we believe,
quite candidly, that open outcry has been a superior trading system. The
concept is very appealing - the one issue in everyone's mind is the
infrastructure in Dublin.'
The CBoT is also considering linkages with other exchanges, but discussions
with Liffe in London were abandoned, and talks with the Matif in Paris and
the DTB, the German futures market, were preliminary.
Even with the greater array of products provided by the CBoT, there is no
guarantee that a critical mass of trading could be achieved in Dublin. The
question of whether traders really need to trade outside their own time
zones, given the global reach of most securities houses, applies to the
Dublin project as well as to Globex.
But the Irish Industrial Development Authority has created a favourable
environment with a 10 per cent tax rate for exchanges and member firms - so
the venture promises to be a relatively cheap one for participants.
Trading permits for Finex Europe, the Dublin branch of Finex, are to cost
only Dollars 10,000, and cheques have already started arriving - including
one from Mr William O'Connor, the former chairman of the CBoT.
Finex decided to expand into Europe two years ago, according to Mr Sean
McNamara, an independent trader at CIG Asset Management and a member of the
Finex board. 'We approached Globex to join the system and they told us we
were not invited,' he recounts.
The exchange then decided that a physical move to Europe would be a better
option. Dublin 'is a platform for us to access the European marketplace,'
says Mr McNamara. 'We are not trying to build a Liffe or a CME; if we can do
2,000 contracts a day, 50-100 people will be making a nice living and we
will have a platform from which to grow.'

Sun Microsystems, the US market leader in computer workstations, reported an

The company made Dollars 43.8m, or 46 cents a share, up from Dollars 24.1m,
or 23 cents, a year before, on revenues up 8 per cent at Dollars 1.13bn. The
earnings were broadly in line with market expectations.
Mr Kevin Melia, chief financial officer, said: 'Sun's successful new product
offerings and the resulting strength in the high-end product mix, as well as
our continued focus on cost management, helped increase gross margins from
last year's level.'
Bookings had grown to a new record.
For the six months, net income jumped to Dollars 60.4m, or 62 cents a share,
up from Dollars 28.9m, or 28 cents, on revenues 10 per cent higher at
Dollars 2.09bn.
The California-based company also announced Mr Melia was to step down as
chief financial officer and move to the east coast of the US for 'personal
reasons'. He will be replaced by Mr Michael Lehman, corporate controller.

<TEXT>
Universal Breweries, the majority shareholder of Brazil's Brahma beer group,
has bought control of CA Cervecera Nacional, Venezuela's second-largest beer
producer.
Brahma, which will operate the Venezuelan beer maker, plans to launch new
products in Venezuela and introduce its popular Brahma Chopp beer. Details
on the transaction were not disclosed.
Brahma's presence in Venezuela, part of an international expansion
programme, should provide strong competition for Empresas Polar, whose Polar
beer dominates around 90 per cent of the domestic market, and Cervecera
Regional, another producer.
Polar is owned by the Mendoza Fleury family, while Regional is controlled by
the Cisneros group. Cervecera Nacional shares are listed on the Caracas
stock exchange, but are not actively traded.
Both Brahma and Polar are among the world's largest brewers. Cervecera
Nacional was once the leading Venezuelan beer producer but was overtaken by
Polar in the 1970s. Nacional has 6 per cent of Venezuela's beer market and
34 per cent of the market for 'malta', a non-alcoholic malt beverage. It
also exports to the Caribbean.
While Venezuela is a relatively small market, with a population of 20m, beer
is a big seller. Beer output in 1992 was more than 72m litres, or 61 per
cent of all alcoholic beverages sold.

FT  20 JAN 94 / International Company News: Iberia goes ahead with Dollars
500m injection for Argentine airline
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Iberia, Spain's national airline, said it would go ahead with a
controversial Dollars 500m capital injection for the troubled Aerolneas
Argentinas.
However, Iberia, which operates and holds 30 per cent of Argentina's
privatised flag-carrier, failed to convince the Argentine government, which
still owns 33 per cent of the company, to contribute.
Mr Domingo Cavallo, economy minister, has said the government would not put
any more money into Aerolneas after being forced to take back 28 per cent of
the company in 1992 to prevent its collapse.
Aerolneas lost Dollars 230m last year and revenues fell 14 per cent to
Dollars 795.1m. Officials blame much of its problems on Iberia's poor
management, and say its difficulties will not be overcome by injecting more
money.
Spanish and Argentine banks with close business relationships with Iberia
hold 23 per cent of Aerolneas and have agreed to participate in the capital
increase. However, one of these banks is the troubled Banesto with a 7.5 per
cent stake.
The capital-raising exercise will have to involve more local investors
because Argentines must own a majority of Aerolneas for it to retain
flag-carrier status. The airline says the employees' share ownership scheme,
which holds 10 per cent of Aerolneas, and the pilots' union have offered to
join in.
Mr Juan Saez, Iberia executive vice-president, has warned that unless
Aerolneas receives fresh capital it would soon face collapse. However, he
said last week Iberia would be willing to sell its stake for Dollars 500m,
which was roughly what it paid for its share in the company at its
privatisation in 1990.

Grupo Financiero Banamex-Accival (Banacci), Mexico's largest financial
group, recorded a 35 per cent increase in total profits to 3.59bn new pesos
(Dollars 1.16bn) last year, after a big increase in gains from money-market
and equity trading.
Banacci's profits include 861m pesos of unrealised gains on securities
trading. It said that adjusting for income tax and profit sharing, profits
would be Dollars 3.21bn, 21 per cent up on 1992.
Banacci subsidiaries' profits - which exclude the group's unrealised gains
from securities trading - reached 2.68bn pesos last year, just 1 per cent
more than last year. Banamex, the group's bank and largest subsidiary,
reported total net income of 2.36bn pesos last year, 2.5 per cent lower than
1993.
For the fourth quarter, Banacci lifted profits, including unrealised
securities gains, to 1.36bn pesos, 39 per cent up on the same period last
year. Banamex achieved profits of 626m pesos, compared with 743m pesos in
the same quarter last year.
It blamed Banamex's drop in profits on Mexico's weak economy last year, lack
of liquidity and its aggressive increase in provisions for loan losses.
Last year Banamex provided for 2.97bn pesos for loan losses.

Trading on the Tokyo foreign exchange market dropped to a five-year low last
year, raising doubts over the viability of Tokyo's role as the leading
financial market in the far east.
Spot and swap volume traded through forex brokers last year fell 3.4 per
cent compared with 1992, to Dollars 5,963bn, the lowest level since 1988.
Trading volume has fallen steadily since the peak in 1990.
Derivatives trading also declined. Some big US and European houses, the
leading participants, moved their operations to Hong Kong and Singapore as a
result of high costs.
Slow deregulation by the ministry of finance, limiting the number of
instruments traded in Tokyo, has also discouraged some traders. The ministry
has yet to lift its ban on forward rate agreements, originally expected last
year.
Similar trends have occurred in the stock market, where investors trading
the Nikkei stock futures index have shifted trade to Singapore,
The Japanese financial authorities need to make a concerted effort in making
Tokyo a more attractive financial market, says Mr Kazuo Fujii, senior
managing director of forex brokers Nittan AP.

FT  20 JAN 94 / International Company News: Pfizer equity tumbles 7% as
growth in sales slows
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Pfizer shares tumbled by more than 7 per cent yesterday as the US drugs
group reported a sharp slowdown in sales growth in the final three months of
1993. Other pharmaceuticals stocks fell as investors anticipated a fall in
sales.
Pfizer, which had been growing faster than many other drugs groups as a
result of successful drug launches, said sales in its core pharmaceuticals
business rose by 6 per cent in the final quarter. In the previous
three-month period, drug sales had achieved year-on-year growth of 13 per
cent. The shares fell Dollars 5 to close at Dollars 62 7/8 .
While some new drugs continued to grow fast, sales of Procardia XL, the
hypertension treatment that is Pfizer's biggest-selling product, were 11 per
cent lower than a year before, at Dollars 272m. Total sales for Procardia
for the year were up 11 per cent at Dollars 1.18bn, while sales of all drugs
rose 13 per cent in 1993 to Dollars 5.13bn.
Pfizer said the slowdown reflected a move by drugs wholesalers to cut
inventory levels, causing a one-off dip in sales. It also pointed to the
'timing of consumer health care trade promotions' during the latest period.
These were one-off factors which would not dent sales growth in future, and
prescription demand for its drugs remained strong, Pfizer said.
Other areas saw a fall in income. Hospital products sales fell 4 per cent,
while consumer healthcare products fell 2 per cent.
While group sales for the quarter were only 2 per cent ahead, at Dollars
1.98bn, research and development spending rose 16 per cent to Dollars 286m.
compared with a year before. As a result, operating income was just Dollars
5m higher, at Dollars 406m (before one-off items in 1992).
Net income for the period rose to Dollars 289m, or 90 cents a share, from
Dollars 279m, or 83 cents a year earlier. Full-year net income was Dollars
658m, or Dollars 2.05, after the effects of a Dollars 575m post-tax
restructuring charge announced in the third quarter, compared with Dollars
1.09bn, or Dollars 3.25, before accounting changes in 1992.

FT  20 JAN 94 / International Company News: Loss worse than expected at AMR

<TEXT>
AMR, parent company of American Airlines, the second biggest US carrier,
slumped into worse-than-expected after-tax losses of Dollars 253m in its
fourth quarter after a brief period of profitability in the proceeding two
quarters.
The main reason for the losses was a damaging strike by the airline's flight
attendants which lost the company nearly all its passenger revenue for five
days in November. AMR said yesterday the strike had cost Dollars 190m,
compared with its earlier estimates of Dollars 160m.
It had warned the strike would bring fourth-quarter losses and the company
would show a loss for the year but the figures were worse than most analysts
had predicted.
The share price rose Dollars 1 5/8 to close at Dollars 71 1/2 as investors
looked to a recovery in the airline's performance in the current year.
Fourth-quarter revenues were up at Dollars 3.59bn from Dollars 3.58bn, while
the net losses of Dollars 253m, equivalent to Dollars 3.55 a share, compared
with losses in the previous year's fourth quarter of Dollars 200m, or
Dollars 2.66.
AMR said the latest figures had been hit by restructuring and other charges
costing Dollars 62m, or 82 cents a share.
For the full year, revenue rose to Dollars 15.8bn from Dollars 14.4bn and
net losses fell to Dollars 110m from Dollars 935m. Losses per share were
down to Dollars 2.23 from Dollars 12.49.
KLM Royal Dutch Airlines will keep a 20 per cent stake in the ordinary share
capital of Northwest Airlines after Northwest's share issue, Reuter reports
from Amsterdam.
The Dutch flag carrier said it would exchange Northwest preference shares
into new ordinary shares to maintain its stake in the US airline, which
announced a Dollars 400m stock initial public offering.

FT  20 JAN 94 / International Company News: Net income at Intel soars to
Dollars 2.3bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Intel, the US semiconductor maker whose microprocessors are used in most of
the world's 100m personal computers, reported sharply higher earnings and
revenues for 1993.
However, Wall Street regarded the figures as shy of expectations and
yesterday the shares closed down Dollars 4 3/4 at Dollars 62 1/2 .
Net income for 1993 was Dollars 2.3bn, the first time the company has broken
the Dollars 2bn barrier and more than double the Dollars 1.07bn reported in
1992. Earnings per share more than doubled to Dollars 5.20 compared with
Dollars 2.49 last year. Revenues were Dollars 8.78bn, a 50 per cent
improvement on the Dollars 5.84bn in 1992.
Fourth-quarter revenues and net income, at Dollars 2.39bn and Dollars 594m
respectively, were records, although the company said the results had been
affected by heavier than usual start-up costs for chip factories in
California and Ireland.
The figures confirm Intel's position as the world's leading semiconductor
manufacturer, ahead of NEC of Japan, and the strength of demand for its most
powerful microprocessors, including the new Pentium chip.
The company said it intended to maintain momentum with the launch within
weeks of a product capable of transforming a conventional PC into a personal
videoconferencing system.
The kit, including television camera and sound system, would be easily
affordable by companies. It would soon be cheap enough for home use.
According to Dataquest, a US market research company, Intel's share of the
world semiconductor market grew to 9.6 per cent, against 7.8 per cent last
year.
Mr Andrew Grove, Intel chief executive, said that during 1993, the company
had increased production of its leading edge 486/DX2 and Pentium processors
and cut prices: 'In 1994, we plan to do more of the same. Our goal is to
double the performance of the processors used at key price points.'
Intel said strong orders in the fourth quarter should support revenue growth
in the first quarter of 1994 and that demand continued to be strong in the
PC market place.
Europe, which accounted for 28 per cent of sales, last year emerged as the
company's fastest growing region with sales of Dollars 2.4bn, up 66 per cent
on the 1992 figure of Dollars 1.44bn.
Intel has moved ahead of Philips of the Netherlands as Europe's leading
semiconductor manufacturer.

Procter &amp; Gamble, the US consumer products group, is to drop part of its
planned acquisition of VP-Schickedanz, the German maker of consumer hygiene
products, because of concern that it could raise competition issues.
The purchase will exclude more than half of VPS's volume of feminine hygiene
products. P&amp;G said it had taken the decision after discussions with the
European Commission's competition directorate.
The deal, originally thought to be worth about DM1bn (Dollars 580m), is

capacity.
It will make coil up to 96 inches wide and  3/4 inch thick and plate up to
120 inches wide and two inches thick. The workforce will total 300 people
and will start production in 1996.
Mr Roger Phillips, president, said Ipsco chose Iowa because of an abundant

Weyerhaeuser, the US forest products company reported earnings of Dollars
101.7m, or 50 cents a share, in the fourth quarter, in spite of a Dollars
21m loss for the quarter in its pulp and paper division.
Last year, fourth-quarter earnings were Dollars 85.3m, or 42 cents. Sales
for the quarter were Dollars 2.59bn, a 10 per cent rise.
The company said prices for logs and lumber exceeded year-ago levels,
lifting operating earnings from its timberlands and wood products segment to
Dollars 258m, from Dollars 175m in the fourth quarter of 1992.
For the year, Weyerhaeuser recorded earnings of Dollars 579.3m, or Dollars
2.83, on sales of Dollars 9.54bn, compared with 1992 earnings of Dollars
372m, or Dollars 1.83, on sales of Dollars 9.27bn.
Boise Cascade, the Idaho-based US forest products company, said its losses
in the fourth quarter nearly matched a year ago, but that higher wood prices
had increased revenues for the year. Losses continued at its pulp and paper
operations.
Boise Cascade posted a net loss of Dollars 23.7m, or 98 cents, for the
quarter, compared with a loss of Dollars 29.6m, or 97 cents, a year ago.
Sales in the quarter were Dollars 997m, against Dollars 906m in last year's
fourth quarter.
For the year, the company lost Dollars 77m, or Dollars 3.17, on sales of
Dollars 4bn, compared with 1992 losses of Dollars 227.5m, or Dollars 6.73,
on sales of Dollars 3.7bn.

Safra Republic, the Geneva-based international private banking group
controlled by Mr Edmond Safra, has reported consolidated net income of
Dollars 121.6m for 1993, 31.5 per cent higher than in 1992.
The directors are recommending a 22 per cent increase in the dividend to
Dollars 2.75 a share.
Net interest income grew 10.4 per cent to Dollars 140.2m after loan loss
provisions increased 30 per cent to Dollars 81m, reflecting an improvement
in both lending volume and spreads.
Trading income jumped 31 per cent to Dollars 27.3m and commission income
soared 74 per cent to Dollars 58.8m, thanks to the growth in earnings from
group investment funds and other off-balance sheet client portfolio assets.
Profits on securities were up 9.6 per cent to Dollars 29.7m.
Total assets at December 31 1993 stood at Dollars 11.3bn, 9.1 per cent
higher than a year earlier. A 6.4 per cent decline in client deposits to
Dollars 5.9bn was more than offset by a 140 per cent jump in bank deposits
to Dollars 1.4bn.
Shareholders' equity stood at Dollars 1.28bn at the year end, 13.2 per cent
higher than a year earlier.
Some Dollars 90m of the increase came as a result of Safra adopting a
financial standard (SFAS 115) requiring it to state securities at fair
value.

<TEXT>
BankAmerica, the California-based banking group, missed out on the earnings
advances at other big US banks in the final months of last year as it
continued to await economic recovery in its home state.
The bank, the second largest in the US ranked by assets, met stock market
expectations with fourth-quarter net income of Dollars 496m, or Dollars 1.21
a share, compared with Dollars 486m, or Dollars 1.18, in the preceding three
months and Dollars 473m, or Dollars 1.18, in the last quarter of 1992.
For the year as a whole, after-tax earnings per share edged down to Dollars
4.76, from Dollars 4.81 last year, on net income up at Dollars 1.95bn from
Dollars 1.68bn, in both cases after adjusting for the effects of the
acquisition of Security Pacific in 1992.
Mr Richard Rosenberg, chairman and chief executive, pointed to continuing
economic difficulties in California, where the bank earns an estimated
two-thirds of its revenues.
He added that there had been encouraging events last year, including a
record performance by its wholesale banking side and a record rise by the
number of accounts opened on the consumer banking side.
BankAmerica reversed the decline in its loan book in the latest period, the
first time loans have grown since early in 1992. Loans at the end of last
year totalled Dollars 126.4bn, up from Dollars 125.6bn three months earlier.
However, the bank's net interest margin declined to 4.66 per cent, from 4.74
per cent in the previous period and 4.98 per cent the year before.
As a result, net interest income was lower than a year before.
Non-interest rose Dollars 112m to Dollars 1.1bn, due mainly to an Dollars
80m gain from the sale of real estate assets.
Like other US banks, BankAmerica saw a continuing improvement in the quality
of its assets during the final period, with its provisions to cover loan
losses falling to Dollars 150m in the quarter, compared with Dollars 270m a
year before. Also, non-accruing assets fell by the end of the year to
Dollars 2.9bn, from Dollars 5bn at the end of 1992.
These advances were less marked than improvements in credit quality at Wells
Fargo, BankAmerica's west coast neighbour, which reported results late on
Tuesday.
Wells Fargo's loan loss provision fell to Dollars 80m in the final quarter,
down from Dollars 300m in the same period in 1992, while the full-year
provision dropped to Dollars 550m from Dollars 1.2bn.
Wells Fargo's fourth-quarter net income rose to Dollars 190m, or Dollars
3.18 a share, compared with Dollars 58m, or Dollars 83 cents a share, a year
before.

FT  20 JAN 94 / International Company News: Shares slide as Digital
Equipment disappoints
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Digital Equipment fell sharply yesterday when the troubled US
computer manufacturer reported a second-quarter net loss of Dollars 72.1m -
far worse than Wall Street had expected - and a 12 per cent drop in
operating revenues.
The red ink, which worked through at 53 cents a share, was little changed
from the loss of Dollars 73.8m, or 57 cents a share, reported in the same
period of last year. Analysts had been looking for earnings close to
break-even.
Digital's shares closed at Dollars 32 3/4 , down Dollars 3 5/8 , on the New
York Stock Exchange.
Digital, like International Business Machines, has been struggling to come
to grips with fundamental changes in the computer market. These have shifted
demand away from its mini-computers to networks of much cheaper personal
computers, and workstations, using 'open systems' rather than proprietary
software.
Mr Robert Palmer, chief executive since July 1992, is overseeing a
restructuring programme which has had mixed results: a return to profits in
the three months to last June, followed by worse-than-expected losses in
each of the last two quarters.
Mr Palmer, expressing dissatisfaction with last quarter's revenues and loss,
said Digital continued to work to lower its costs, stabilise and then
improve revenues.
'It took several years for the company to get into this situation, and it is
taking some time for us to restore profitability and growth,' he said.
The revenue decline was attributed mainly to a continued drop in demand for
the company's larger VAX computer systems. The company said its personal
computer business continued to double in units, year-over-year, and showed
strong double-digit revenue growth.
The results were hit by unfavourable foreign currency movements, weakness in
the European and US economies, and a decline in product margins, due to a
shift in the mix of sales to products with lower profits, such as personal
computers.
For the six months to January 1, Digital reported a net loss of Dollars
155.3m, or Dollars 1.15 a share, compared with a loss of Dollars 334.4m, or
Dollars 2.60 a share, last time.

a keen amateur sailor, but he admits he has never taken his 35-foot racing
yacht, Eloisa, across the English Channel.
Nor will he have a chance to make the voyage in the next few months.
Instead, it seems Mr Chazot is set to spend more time travelling under the
Channel than sailing across it. On Tuesday, he made his first trip through
the tunnel which he must now turn into a profitable transport under-taking.
Despite a long and apparently successful career with international
companies, Mr Chazot, 54, is not a name familiar to the business community
outside France. He is also taking on a role whose previous occupant, Sir
Alastair Morton, established a fearsome reputation for getting things done.
Mr Chazot was picked after a search by two teams of headhunters in Paris and
London. Sir Alastair said Eurotunnel was looking for 'the best man without
regard to nationality'.
Not that Mr Chazot regards himself as being particularly French. 'I feel a
little detached from that type of consideration,' he said yesterday. 'My
basic business education was in the US for the first three years of my
business life.'
He was educated at the Ecole Polytechnique in Paris, and at the University
of Florida, graduating with a degree in electrical engineering and a diploma
in marketing.
Most of his subsequent career has been industry, and he worked for 14 years
each at Schlumberger, the international engineering group, and CGE (now
Alcatel Alsthom), the telecommunications company.
He ranks as one of his successes the transformation of Saft, Alcatel's
battery subsidiary, from a company with 'a culture of high-tech arrogance to
a service-minded corporation'.
Among his career disappointments, he recalls the problems he had taking to
Alcatel the hard-driving commercial approach he brought from Schlumberger.
Alcatel, he says, had 'a public telephone company culture'.
From Alcatel he went to Adia, a Swiss temporary employment agency, running
its French subsidiary for 18 months. 'Time with a service company
complemented my industrial experience,' he said. 'Eurotunnel is a service
company and nothing else.'
Eurotunnel nevertheless represents another significant career switch. 'There
are few, if any, parallels with this project,' said one French banker. 'The
important thing is that he has an international background, has shown
himself to be an able manager, and that he is installed before the tunnel
opens its services.'
One valuable lesson Mr Chazot brings from Adia is experience with price
competition. In industry, he said, he sold on quality and on innovation but
at Adia, which was fighting for business in a depressed market place, price
and margins took on increased importance.
If forecasts of a tariff war between the cross-Channel ferries are borne
out, this experience will be useful. Eurotunnel insists it has no plans to
compete with the ferries on price, but it may have little choice.
Although Mr Chazot is taking over as chief executive, Sir Alastair will
remain as co-chairman. Both men were keen to stress they would have
complementary and not conflicting roles.
Mr Chazot is to spend the next four months ensuring that services which run
through the tunnel - the car passenger shuttles, passenger trains and
freight services - are launched as planned, and that the business starts to
make profits.
This is a task which will involve him closely in the operational and
marketing sides of the company. Sir Alastair and Mr Graham Corbett, the
finance director, will devote their time to solving outstanding disputes
with the railways and raising an additional Pounds 1bn of finance.
'We want to prevent Mr Chazot from being overburdened by the problems of the
past,' said Mr Andre Benard, co-chairman.
However, for an untried business with Pounds 10bn invested in an intensely
competitive market, the problems of the past will be hard to ignore.

FT  20 JAN 94 / International Company News: Falling prices hit Thyssen Stahl
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Losses at Thyssen Stahl, Germany's largest steelmaker, quadrupled in the
year to September, to DM1.23bn (Dollars 703m). The company blamed declining
steel prices and falling domestic orders.
Turnover for the year fell by 15 per cent, to DM10.6bn. The company said the
fall in steel prices accounted for DM500m of its losses.
Weak demand, especially from the automotive industry, also contributed to
the company's heavy losses, with deliveries decreasing by 10 per cent for
the fiscal year.
Mr Ekkehard Schulz, chairman, said he did not expect marked improvements in
1994, as domestic demand is expected to remain weak. However, he said the
company's drastic cost-cutting measures should allow it to return to the
black in the 1994-1995 financial year.
Turnover for the first quarter of the year continued to fall, dropping 7 per
cent to DM2.5bn against the same period the previous year. Crude steel
production stood at 2.4m tonnes in the first quarter, an 11 per cent
increase over the previous year. Thyssen Stahl's total crude steel
production in 1993 stood at 8.3m tonnes.
'We expect the coming year to remain as unsatisfactory as the year before,'
Mr Schulz said.
'But we think that the bottom has been reached, and that business will at
least not deteriorate further. A pick-up in demand for steel products
cannot, however, be expected before the second half of 1994.'
Meanwhile, he said Thyssen Stahl had no alternative but to continue laying
off workers to cut costs and reduces losses. The company announced earlier
this week an additional 1,250 workers would go by the year end. A two-year
restructuring programme already plans to axe 30 per cent of its 40,000
workforce by October 1994.
Mr Schulz said the restructuring programme would allow for productivity
increases of between 4 and 5 per cent in coming years. Restructuring
measures have also included the merging of the company's steel and special
steel divisions, which took effect at the beginning of the 1992-1993
business year.
Economies of scale are also expected in the divisions producing tin plates
and non-corrosive steels, which are due to be merged with Krupp-Hoesch,
Germany's second-largest steelmaker.

<TEXT>
Volvo's new board will focus on talks with France's Renault on the future of
their three-year-old alliance, Mr Bert-Olof Svanholm, Volvo's new chairman,
said yesterday. His comments come in the wake of the collapse last month of
plans by the two companies to merge.
Speaking shortly after his election, Mr Svanholm was careful not to say what
the result might be. However, he intends to inform shareholders of the
outcome - and of the new board's long-term strategy for Volvo - at the
annual general meeting in April.
Mr Svanholm, who heads the Swedish operations of Asea Brown Boveri, the
Swiss-Swedish engineering group, succeeded Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar, who
resigned after two decades in charge of Volvo when confronted with a
shareholder and senior management revolt against the merger plan.
The new chairman insisted Volvo would rebound from the trauma. 'It is a
company with big possibilities for the future,' he said.
Mr Svanholm was proposed by a group of Swedish institutional shareholders
representing 40 per cent of the voting capital. The meeting accepted their
other six board nominees, including Mr Soren Gyll, Volvo chief executive,
and Mr Louis Schweitzer, the chairman and chief executive of Renault, which
remains Volvo's biggest shareholder with 10 per cent of the voting capital.
Mr Gyll said Volvo last year achieved its first increase in car sales since
1986, in spite of recession in Europe and the upheaval caused by the merger
uproar.
Christopher Brown-Humes in Stockholm adds: Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar is stepping
down as a vice-chairman of Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken.
'It is natural that after leaving Volvo, I should also leave the SE-Banken
board so that I remain free for the future,' he said.

FT  20 JAN 94 / International Company News: McDonnell posts Dollars 132m
loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
McDonnell Douglas, the US defence and aerospace group, yesterday reported a
fourth-quarter loss of Dollars 132m after taking a special Dollars 450m
pre-tax charge for its controversial C-17 aircraft programme.
Exclusive of the charge, its earnings rose by some 66 per cent.
The figures represent a further stage in the financial recovery of the
company. Two years ago, it appeared in serious difficulties with a heavy
debt burden, a contracting defence market and softening airliner sales.
However, it fought back with a programme to cut costs, improve efficiency
and sell peripheral assets. It reported yesterday that its aerospace debt
reached a six-year low of Dollars 1.62bn at the end of 1993, after a drop of
Dollars 349m in the final quarter and Dollars 1.14bn in the year as a whole.
It reported fourth-quarter earnings before charges of Dollars 143m, or
Dollars 3.63 a share, up from Dollars 86m, or Dollars 2.20, in the same
period of 1992 on sales which shrunk to Dollars 3.63bn from Dollars 4.62bn.
For the full year, earnings totalled Dollars 396m, or Dollars 10.10 a share,
compared with Dollars 79m, or Dollars 2.03, in 1992, excluding unusual
items.
Mr Herb Lanese, finance director, said 1993 had been a pivotal year in which
McDonnell had demonstrated its 'survivability'. It now had to demonstrate to
the outside world that 1993 was not a fluke and that it was a 'much
stronger, revitalised corporation'.
He said analysts' estimates of 1994 earnings per share between Dollars 11.50
and Dollars 13.25 were 'not unreasonable'. At the end of this month the
board would be reviewing the company's dividend pay-out ratio, which he
acknowledged was 'low compared with our peers'.

FT  20 JAN 94 / International Company News: Daf nets Fl 10m in 10 months
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Daf Trucks, the Dutch truck maker rescued from financial collapse last year,
made a net profit of Fl 10m (Dollars 5m) in the 10 months from March to
December.
The company is still majority-owned by the Dutch and Flemish governments,
but it is expected that the combined state holding will be reduced to a
minority position later this year.
Mr Cor Baan, chairman of the Daf Trucks management board, said the company
had achieved a turnover of Fl 1.3bn in the final 10 months of last year.
He forecast further growth in turnover and profit this year, despite
continued weakness in the European truck market.
The company has begun negotiations with the Dutch unions to increase the
flexibility of its labour agreements. It is seeking to increase the working
week to 38 hours from the present 36.
It is also seeking to introduce a new shift system with a 9 1/2 -hour day,
four days a week with the possibility of the plant working 6 days a week.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Despite 'the most adverse market and trading conditions in the history of
the company', RCO Holdings reported maintained levels of profits and
turnover for the 53 weeks to October 1.
The supplier of integrated site support services achieved a pre-tax profit
of Pounds 4.77m from turnover of Pounds 48.8m for the period, against a
profit of Pounds 4.72m on turnover of Pounds 47m in the previous 52-week
period.
At the operating level profits were static at Pounds 4.42m, and with cash
holdings increasing to Pounds 5.8m (Pounds 3.8m), net interest receivable
rose to Pounds 352,000 (Pounds 303,000).
A final dividend of 10.25p (9.24p) makes a 15.2p (13.86p) total. The
dividend is almost twice covered by earnings per share of 29.67p (29.16p).

FT  20 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Lasmo's Kalimantan reserves upgraded
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lasmo, the independent oil exploration and production company which has been
suffering from weak prices, yesterday announced a 13 per cent upgrade to the
proved reserves of one of its biggest assets.
The reserve figure for the Sanga Sanga production sharing contract in
Kalimantan, Indonesia, has been increased by 59m barrels of oil equivalent.
It supplies 60 per cent of the gas to the world's largest liquefied natural
gas plant at Bontang. The upgrade was the result of new exploratory drilling
and revised estimates by independent consultants of the amount of
recoverable reserves in the field.
Analysts say the revision is a positive long-term development for Lasmo,
whose recent record at finding new reserves has failed to match industry
averages. It could also have some beneficial effect on short-term profits,
but the company's financial position will remain under strain because of the
need to finance a new gas field development in Liverpool Bay.
Mr Joe Darby, chief executive, said further reserve upgrades of Kalimantan
were likely, although they might not be so large.
Lasmo is one of eight oil companies which Standard and Poors, the credit
rating agency, yesterday warned could suffer further because of current low
oil prices. Other companies whose ratings have been placed on 'Creditwatch
with negative implications' status include Arco Chemical, Atlantic
Richfield, Enterprise Oil, Norsk Hydro, Oryx Energy, Petrofina and Santa Fe
Energy Resources.

FT  20 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Beales Hunter shows 5% advance to Pounds
1.43m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Despite a lower contribution from its textiles side, Beales Hunter increased
pre-tax profits by 5 per cent from Pounds 1.36m to Pounds 1.43m in the half
year to November 30. Sales grew by 11 per cent to Pounds 27m.
At the operating level, profits rose 13 per cent to Pounds 1.6m, including
Pounds 20,000 from two businesses acquired during the year. Higher interest
of Pounds 173,000 (Pounds 53,000) reflected the cost of these acquisitions.
Earnings per share edged ahead from 10.4p to 10.6p, while the interim
dividend is stepped up to 2.55p (2.45p).
The refrigeration division - including new subsidiary JT Herbert - increased
sales and profits. Obtaining installation business remained difficult, but
order levels continued to improve.
The electrical side also showed an improvement, mainly as a result of demand
for non-rewirable plugs. Some recovery was also seen in sales of traditional
plugs, sockets and connectors to consumer product manufacturers.
Textile results continued to be affected by low margins. Beales said that at
the present levels of profitability, the division still required a
substantial volume increase to produce an acceptable level of return.

FT  20 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Acquisitions behind 60% rise at Rubicon
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Profits of Rubicon Group rose from Pounds 1.22m to Pounds 1.94m pre-tax for
the half year ended November 30. The 60 per cent improvement was scored on
the back of a Pounds 13m rise in turnover to Pounds 23.44m.
Acquisitions were behind the advance. High Speed Production, a manufacturer
of precision metal components and assemblies, contributed Pounds 11.3m to
turnover and Pounds 1.1m to operating profits in the four months since it
joined the group.
Prior to the purchase, Rubicon's sole interest was in the supply of shop
equipment.
Mr George Duncan, chairman, said the result was achieved in the face of a
disappointing outcome for certain of the shop equipment businesses.
He underlined the importance of the contribution made by HSP, which was
acquired in July for Pounds 9m via the issue of shares, loan notes and cash.
Mr Duncan said HSP was benefiting from strong underlying market growth and
improved market share.
Earnings per share for the half year emerged at 7.8p (7.2p) and the interim
dividend is being lifted from 1.5p to 1.8p.

FT  20 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Components side behind rise at Electron
House
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Electron House, the electronic components distributor, lifted pre-tax
profits from Pounds 579,000 to Pounds 1.61m for the six months to November
30.
Mr Robert Leigh, chairman, said group sales in the components market had
risen by 50 per cent, compared with an overall market improvement of 25 per
cent.
Turnover from continuing operations rose by 29 per cent, from Pounds 35.9m
to Pounds 46.2m.
Electronic component sales in the UK rose from Pounds 16.9m to Pounds 25.8m.
Sales in Australia moved ahead from Pounds 4.47m to Pounds 6.54m and in New
Zealand from Pounds 2.23m to Pounds 3.2m. Operating profits from components
sales were Pounds 2.67m (Pounds 1.44m).
However the group's two remaining systems businesses, which accounted for 23
per cent of turnover, fell into the red to the tune of Pounds 296,000,
compared with a previous profit of Pounds 268,000. Sales were down from
Pounds 12.3m to Pounds 10.7m.
Mr Leigh said that CEM Computers, the systems division in Northern Ireland,
was building a substantial service and support business. But Bytech Systems,
where staff had been reduced by 10 per cent, would take time to return to
profitability, and would probably remain in the red in the second half.
Net interest payable fell from Pounds 732,000 to Pounds 383,000. Net
borrowings were down from Pounds 9.1m to Pounds 4.5m, cutting gearing from
80 per cent to 35 per cent.
In 1994, when the components market is estimated to increase by a further 9
per cent, Electron expects to raise its market share further, said Mr Leigh.
This was in part because customers were cutting down the number of their
suppliers, to the benefit of the major distributors. He believed Electron to
be the fourth or fifth biggest in the UK.
Earnings per share rose from 1.1p to 3.74p. The interim dividend has been
lifted to 1.2p (1.05p).

MF's grass equipment division has been appointed exclusive distributor for

The move has been prompted by the largely complementary nature of the two
companies' grass machinery ranges, and builds on existing co-operation

Tops Estates has paid Pounds 14m for two Lancashire shopping centres.
Consideration for the shopping centres - 3 1/2 acres at Ashton-Under-Lyne

The company said that the two additions to the investment portfolio, which
have a combined rent roll of more than Pounds 1.4m (with 10 rent reviews

FT  20 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Crest seeks Pounds 19m for return to
offensive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Crest Nicholson, the Surrey-based house builder and commercial property
developer, yesterday announced a Pounds 19.1m rights issue to expand its
land bank and increase development activities, after three years of
retrenchment.
The announcement was accompanied by the release of better than expected
profit figures for the year to October 31.
Some 22.53m new shares are to be issued at 88p on a 1-for-4 basis. This
represents an 18 per cent discount to Tuesday's closing share price of 108p.
Holders of convertible preference shares will be offered 88 new shares for
every 1,000 held.
The ordinary share price closed up 6p at 114p.
Pre-tax profits for 1993 came to Pounds 2.13m after an exceptional charge of
Pounds 2m, which resulted from a judgment against Crest Nicholson over its
failure to complete on a land purchase in 1988.
The figures for 1992, restated for FRS 3, showed a Pounds 975,000 loss.
Sales in the 12 months increased 15 per cent to Pounds 273m (Pounds 238m).
Mr John Callcutt, chief executive, said the rights issue would provide funds
for the expansion of its short-term land bank - diversifying away from its
core southern focus - and the redevelopment of some of its higher margin
strategic land holdings.
The company is emerging from two years of losses following the collapse in
house prices in 1990 and 1991.
Mr Callcutt said: 'In the last three years, we have been fighting back from
the brink. We are now in a position where gearing has come back down to 39
per cent, and we have done this without calling on shareholders.'
The management would be satisfied with gearing below 50 per cent, compared
with a post rights gearing ratio of 17 per cent.
The dividend of 1p marks Crest's first pay-out since 1990. Earnings per
share amounted to 0.01p (3.96p losses).
COMMENT
This rights issue sets the seal on a remarkable turnround in the company's
fortunes since Mr Callcutt took over in July 1991. Net debt has been more
than halved, from Pounds 104m to Pounds 40m, turnover of residential houses
has hit record levels despite the recession and the group has successfully
unloaded the bulk of its lower margin sites acquired at the peak of the late
1980s property boom. Its current task is to translate this into profits. The
company enjoyed pre-tax profits of Pounds 37.1m in the year to October 1989,
but analysts do not expect it to revisit these levels for some time.

FT  20 JAN 94 / UK Company News: TSB Scotland tops Pounds 82m despite rising
bad debts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TSB Bank Scotland, the Scottish offshoot of the TSB Group, increased its
pre-tax profit in the year to October 31 by 3.8 per cent from Pounds 79.4m
to Pounds 82.4m.
Operating profit was up 11 per cent at Pounds 98.1m while the cost income
ratio fell from 54.5 per cent in 1992 to 52.1 per cent.
Mr Alastair Dempster, the chief executive, acknowledged that the rise in the
pre-tax figures was dwarfed by the jump from Pounds 5m to Pounds 301m in TSB
Group's pre-tax profits, announced last week.
He pointed out that TSB Bank Scotland had been consistently profitable
during its parent company's difficult years, with pre-tax profits rising
steadily from Pounds 40m in 1989.
The bank, which focuses on lending to individuals, suffered a higher level
of bad debts in 1993 than in 1992.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
With the help of much lower interest charges, London &amp; Clydeside Holdings,
the USM-quoted housebuilder operating throughout Scotland, reported an 84
per cent rise in pre-tax profits in the year to September 30.
Lower turnover of Pounds 21.2m was because last year's figure of Pounds
21.98m included the sale of an office block for Pounds 2.5m. After interest
payable of Pounds 913,000 (Pounds 1.58m), pre-tax profit came to Pounds
742,000 (Pounds 404,000).
This year's result would have been higher but for a write-down connected
with a Glasgow office block developed by an associate company.
Earnings per share rose 79 per cent to 5.2p (2.9p) and the final dividend
has been increased to 3p making 4.8p (4.5p) for the year.

FT  20 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Eastern to supply power to 500 McDonald's
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Eastern Electricity yesterday took a high profile bite in a new competitive
section of the power market when it announced a deal to supply 500
McDonald's restaurants in England and Wales from April.
It said the contract, estimated to be worth Pounds 12m annually, is the
biggest and most comprehensive deal announced in the market for users of
between 100 kilowatts and 1 megawatt.
Eastern's shares rose 9 1/2 p to 674p, although part of the increase was
attributable to its move this week to buy back some of its equity to boost
earnings per share.
From April the 45,000 England and Wales consumers of between 10kw and 1MW of
electricity will for the first time be able to pick which company to take
their supplies from.
Previously they have been able to buy only from the monopoly distributor
which supplies their region. The change will not affect the physical source
of the electricity which is generated by separate companies. This is because
suppliers trade rather than generate electricity.
Virtually all of McDonald's stores fall into the 100kw to 1MW category. Mr
Keith Smith, McDonald's chief building services engineer, said Eastern's
offer would provide the company with savings of about Pounds 1.4m on its
total UK bill, including franchise stores, of Pounds 18m.
Eastern was chosen after quotes from 14 suppliers, including most of the
other regional electricity companies.

FT  20 JAN 94 / UK Company News: London Scottish Bank 18% ahead to Pounds
4.54m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London Scottish Bank, the consumer finance company, announced an 18 per cent
increase in pre-tax profits in the year to the end of October 1993.
The company highlighted the restoration of profitability in consumer credit
in taking their pre-tax profits to Pounds 4.54m compared with Pounds 3.85m
in the previous year.
Income from interest on loans rose by 3 per cent to Pounds 19.59m (Pounds
18.96m), while commission on debt collecting rose by 16 per cent to Pounds
6.41m (Pounds 5.51m).
Finance costs for funding lending fell by 4 per cent to Pounds 2.52m (Pounds
2.62m), as a result of low interest rates.
In August, the company bought a debt portfolio from RLJ Finance, which
includes debts spread over a period of a few years. Income from debt
portfolios acquired came to Pounds 333,500.
Income from the sale of Christmas hampers, which rose sharply in the
previous year to make a marked contribution to profits, was down slightly to
Pounds 1.1m (Pounds 1.16m).
There was, however, a slight fall in insurance income to Pounds 3.8m (Pounds
3.84m).
Mr Jack Livingstone, chairman, emphasised the efficiency improvements that
the company, which makes consumer loans and collects debts on behalf of
other companies, had made at the worse performing of its 106 branches, and
also the investment it had made in a new computer system.
Mr Livingstone also announced his intention to retire in March 1995, and the
appointment then of Mr Martin West, the chief executive, as chairman. Mr
Livingstone will be a non-executive director after he steps down.
The bank is already looking for a new chief executive and hopes someone will
be in place in October to begin a transitional period. The whole executive
team is due to retire over the next few years. 'There are a lot of wrinklies
on the board now,' Mr Livingstone said.
The board proposes an increase of 15 per cent in the final dividend to 2.37p
(2.05p) making a 3.4p (3p) total.
The shares put on 6p to 112p.

FT  20 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Barbour Index warns on full year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Barbour Index declined 15p to 218p yesterday on news from the
Windsor-based specialist information services group that its results for the
12 months to end-April would 'be somewhat below those of last year'.
The news accompanied the interim results which showed a 25 per cent fall in
pre-tax profits to Pounds 2.03m for the period to end-October. Turnover fell
8.5 per cent to Pounds 6.4m.
Mr Jack Dunn, chief executive, said he was disappointed in the results, but
added that he was not surprised by them given the group's reliance on the
construction industry. Some 70 per cent of Barbour's income derives from
that source, with the balance from its health and safety information.
The second half was expected to 'show some growth'.
To underline both the group's confidence in the long-term future and its
'sound financial position' - it has Pounds 4.3m (Pounds 4.4m) cash balances
 -the interim dividend is lifted to 2.7p (2.55p).
Barbour supplies information of all kinds, though not advice, to niche
markets like architects and engineers. It also produces and supplies a
directory of building products to 21,000 registered specifiers.
Mr Dunn said that Barbour's soon to be launched expert information systems
would extend the group's markets, stressing that many professionals needed
to have large amounts of wide-ranging information at their fingertips.
Mr Dunn said that on the construction side, renewal rates improved a little
over last year, but that there was still a 15 per cent fall-off for lapsed
subscriptions or failed businesses. New sales remain-ed at a low level.
It was the same for health and safety, though here renewal rates were held
at a 'very good' 90 per cent.
Earnings declined to 8.1p (10.9p) per share.

FT  20 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Second Consolidated plans to make Pounds
25m capital repayment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Second Consolidated, the investment trust which took over the unquoted and
illiquid assets of Drayton Consolidated from Invesco, is planning to make a
capital repayment of about Pounds 25m after realising more than half of the
trust's initial assets.
Second Consolidated was created out of the remains of Drayton Consolidated
in November 1992, and is managed by Foreign &amp; Colonial, with the intention
of winding it up within three to five years.
The board announced a 20.6 per cent increase in net asset value for the
trust's first year to end-October, while the share price rose 72.7 per cent
to 171p. The discount to net asset value has fallen from 36.8 per cent to
11.4 per cent.
There will be an ordinary dividend of 2.1p, but this level is likely to
decrease as investments are sold. The capital repayment, by means of a
capital reduction, is planned for late March, subject to shareholders
approval.
Realisations totalled Pounds 12.1m to end-October, but since then sale
proceeds have increased to Pounds 29.7m. The trust has disposed of about 40
per cent of its stake in Oak Industries, the Boston-based cable television
component company, realising Pounds 5.3m, and sold its entire holding in
Peregrine International Holdings, realising Pounds 7m.
The placing of the Oak shares was complicated by US securities regulations,
which meant the trust was unable to sell at short notice when the share
price was at its height. Further gradual disposals may be more
straightforward.
The geographical distribution of the fund has shifted towards a US
weighting, as most disposals were in the UK, but the strongest growth was in
the US portfolio, particularly Oak Industries and Mid-States. US assets
account for 64.5 per cent of the portfolio, against 45.1 per cent initially.

FT  20 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Competing for market shares / A look at two
new business information providers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
When the London Stock Exchange decided it would no longer be a provider of
information to the markets, it opened up new vistas for commercial providers
to step into the breach.
For years, the Exchange's Topic service was the sole provider of live Stock
Exchange prices and the first to unveil corporate announcements from
companies whose shares it listed. But Reuters Holdings, the business
information service, challenged the Exchange's right to operate a monopoly
on that information and the Exchange was forced for the first time to
compete.
Since then, the Exchange has decided that it cannot compete commercially and
has formed partnerships with two information providers; Telekurs, a
securities database operator owned jointly by a consortium of Swiss banks,
and ICV, a privately owned company providing real-time data services to
professional financial companies throughout Europe. Topic is intended to
cease at the end of this year.
Today, Telekurs formally launches its Topic Plus and Topicline Plus
services, intended to succeed the Stock Exchange's service, and says it
already has orders for more than 500 screens at 40 financial institutions.
Earlier this week, ICV launched its Market-Eye service, intended to replace
Topic, and says it has orders for more than 1,000 screens.
Reuters is already operating its Equity Focus product.
Officially, Telekurs and ICV state that there is no competition between
them. Telekurs has developed a product that it says is aimed at large banks
and securities houses while the ICV product is aimed at private client
stockbrokers and small fund management firms.
'We are aiming at the more professional end of the market,' said Mr Tudor
Morgan, Telekurs managing director. 'Competition with Reuters is the big
thing.'
Fund managers, stockbrokers and salesmen say that the three firms are
competing fiercely with each other for market share in a sector which is
expected to grow exponentially. 'There are 9,000 Topic users,' Mr Morgan
said. 'We'd like to think that 50 per cent of them will be Telekurs
customers by the end of this year.'
There is much more at stake than just the Topic business. The provider with
the greatest market share has the greatest opportunity to sell other
services and effectively piggyback on the screens already in place.
The differences between the services are not great, but users say that even
the small differences will make a great difference in their final choice.
The prices for the basic service are much of a muchness; Telekurs charges
Pounds 2,800 a year for its basic service, with significant discounts for
orders of 10 screens or more. ICV charges Pounds 2,500 per terminal, and
users say Reuters' rates are in line with those.
The differences are in the ease with which users can access the information
and the quantity and method of display. Both Reuters and Telekurs use a
'Windows' format and users hold a mouse to flip between pages. By April,
Telekurs will be able to offer its users feeds from other stock exchanges
besides London, one of the key attractions now offered only by Reuters. It
also offers other unusual features such as the ability to scan the front
pages of leading UK newspapers.
Also, up until late last year, Reuters had been resisting demands from
potential clients that it modify its system to allow them to receive direct
feeds of data from some leading stockbroking firms which offer closed-end
systems themselves. This resistance was said to be driving some fund
managers into the arms of the competition, particularly Telekurs.
However, last November Reuters changed its tune, users say, and is now
offering to pay those stockbroking firms for the costs of rewriting their
programmes to be compatible with its own system.
But market users say that the ICV system offers the greatest comfort because
it most closely replicates the Topic system that many brokers, now in their
40s and 50s, have grown up with.
'Users are not interested in learning how to drive a new car,' said an
official at one integrated securities firm which will need some 35 to 70 new
screens. Like Topic, the ICV system relies on a keypad to help users find
information, and users say it is quick and reliable. 'Reuters is not easy to
use; it does not have the same look and feel of Topic,' he said.

FT  20 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Zofran approval in Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Glaxo has secured approval in Japan to sell one of its fastest growing
products, Zofran, which reduces the side-effects of cancer chemotherapy.
Zofran will be competing against a newer SmithKline Beecham product, Kytril.
The Japanese market is unusual in that Kytril was launched there 18 months
ago. In most other countries, Zofran was approved first.
Analysts yesterday estimated that annual sales of Kytril in Japan were
already worth Pounds 70m. Zofran has an advantage over Kytril in that it has
been approved for both injections and tablets. Kytril is only available as
an injection, although this is the normal means of delivering anti-emetic
drugs in cancer chemotherapy.
The launch date for Zofran in Japan is in the spring.

FT  20 JAN 94 / International Company News: Kent Corporation goes into
receivership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kent Corporation, the mechanical and electrical contractor and one of
Ireland's biggest employers, went into receivership yesterday.
The company, which has its headquarters in Tipperary and employs about
6,000, is the latest to fall victim to the construction industry recession.
Recent work has included contracts for the troubled Hotel Arts complex in
Barcelona and a major electrical engineering contract at Guys Hospital in
London, which also has been subject to a dispute.
Problems on the hospital contract are thought to have contributed to the
group's downfall.
Mr Rory O'Ferrall and Mr Patrick Butler of Deloitte &amp; Touche were yesterday
appointed receivers to the group.
In a separate move Mr Terry Carter and Ms Maggie Mills of Ernst &amp; Young were
appointed administrative receivers to Kentz, the UK subsidiary which employs
about 500 workers.

<TEXT>
Daejan Holdings, the property company, yesterday announced pre-tax profits
up from Pounds 7.64m to Pounds 8.39m for the half year ended September 30.
The company said that full-year profits were likely to be similar to those

surplus arising on disposal of a subsidiary company.
The interim dividend is maintained at 12p from earnings per share of 34.85p
(30.84p).
Net rental income rose to Pounds 8.36m (Pounds 7.91m) and there was a Pounds
4.09m (Pounds 4.16m) surplus on sale of trading properties.
Operating profits on continuing activities were virtually flat at Pounds
10.1m and there was a Pounds 482,000 (Pounds 354,000) surplus on the sale of
investment properties.

FT  20 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Cadbury to buy French chocolatier for
Pounds 18m

<TEXT>
Cadbury Schweppes, the confectionery and soft drinks company, yesterday
announced the acquisition of Bouquet D'Or for FFr160m (Pounds 18.4m).
The consideration includes acquired debt and can be adjusted according to
the balance sheet at completion.
The cash payment will be met from Cadbury's resources.
Bouquet D'Or, based in Villeneuve d'Asq, to the north of Paris, is a
privately owned company which was founded in 1851 as a family business.
It specialises in boxes of chocolate assortments, particularly praline
products, and had sales in the year to April 30 1993 of FFr257m.
Following the acquisition, the company will be managed by Chocolat Poulain,
a subsidiary of the UK group.
Mr Thierry Bouteil, managing director of Poulain, said that Bouquet D'Or
products would continue to be marketed under their own brand.
'We have not bought the company to eat its brand but to develop it', he
stated.
Mr Bouteil said the combined sales of Poulain and Bouquet D'Or would
represent about 13 per cent of the seasonal assortments sector of the French
chocolate market and put Cadbury Schweppes in third place in terms of market
share, behind Nestle and Lindt of Switzerland.
The French chocolate market has resisted the effects of recession,
increasing by about 2 per cent last year.
Le Syndicat de la Confiserie, the French association of confectionery
producers, estimates the size of the French chocolate market at about
FFr11bn.

FT  20 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Greycoat shows interim loss but recovery
starts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Greycoat yesterday announced further pre-tax losses at the interim stage,
but operating profit exceeded interest payments as it continued its recovery
from the verge of receivership. The management also announced the end of its
programme of property disposals.
In addition, it revealed that Mr Geoffrey Wilson will step down as chairman
at the end of the financial year, while Mr Brian Myerson and Mr Julian
Treger, the two men who formulated the company's rescue package, will join
as non-executive directors.
The management of Greycoat - one of the more aggressive property investors
of the 1980's, which almost collapsed from a combination of rising debt
costs and falling asset values - said it was now in a position to start
looking at financing for future property developments.
The company announced a pre-tax loss of Pounds 43.5m (Pounds 44m), but this
included Pounds 5.2m in reorganisation costs, Pounds 25.2m on losses from
the sale of properties, and Pounds 7.4m from the redemption of the company's
zero coupon bonds, all of which were part of the restructuring. Mr Richard
Guignard, managing director, finance, was confident of a modest profit in
the second half of the year.
The company intends to eliminate its profit and loss account deficit of
Pounds 149.1m, as part of the proposals detailed in its restructuring
document. It will apply for court permission to cancel Pounds 105.7m
standing to the credit of the share premium account and a further Pounds
47.1m of deferred shares, arising from the restructuring.
Mr Wilson said in an official statement: 'We have an established record of
successful commercial property development.'
Turnover amounted to Pounds 20.4m (Pounds 23.9m) primarily from gross rental
income, and this figure should see a gradual increase with the phasing out
of rent free periods on a portion of its portfolio. Losses per share were
49.5p (52.8p). There is no dividend.

FT  20 JAN 94 / UK Company News: QMH calls in the lawyers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Queens Moat Houses, the hotel group currently negotiating a Pounds 1.3bn
financial restructuring, has had to call in lawyers to sort out an
embarrassing technical hitch.
Mr Andrew Coppel, chief executive, said yesterday, 'it is simply a corporate
legal irritation'. He said it would not delay the group's refinancing.
QMH admitted it had failed to give holders of its 7 per cent convertible
preference shares, which were issued in 1985 in a rights issue, the chance
to vote in September 1989 and August last year on resolutions to increase
the group's borrowing powers.
This means the resolutions, which increased the group's borrowing powers,
were not valid. It also calls into question the validity of other
resolutions passed at the same meetings.
However, it said the invalidity of the borrowing powers resolutions did not
mean the company's borrowings could be called into question.
The discovery has raised 'complex issues' the company said, and it has
appointed Freshfields, the City solicitors, and leading counsel to advise on
how to resolve them. Mr Coppel said QMH had been advised it would not need
to hold last year's annual meeting again.
The other resolutions passed at the agm, which was adjourned in August and
concluded in November, included the appointment of Mr Coppel as chief
executive, and in November the adoption of the annual report.
QMH said it would 'communicate with shareholders and all other relevant
parties' once the position was clear.
At the end of 1992 there was Pounds 9.17m worth of preference shares
outstanding, which would convert into a total of 20.8m ordinary shares
against the total of 924.3m QMH has in issue at present. Each preference
share has one vote.
The problem does not affect the much larger class of 7 1/2 per cent
convertible preference shares issued in 1991.

FT  20 JAN 94 / UK Company News: A changing landscape in the race for space
 -Tesco takes to the Metro line with its programme of 'compact' expansion
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BY NEIL BUCKLEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
It was Mr Archie Norman, Asda's chief executive, who first broke ranks with
the UK's leading grocers to warn of leaner times ahead, but it took Tesco's
chairman, Sir Ian MacLaurin, to change the food retailing landscape.
His announcement yesterday spelt the end of the era of unbridled superstore
expansion which he helped to usher in.
The Tesco of the next few years will be a different animal from three years
ago, when it launched a Pounds 585m rights issue to fund its aggressive
opening programme.
Then it regarded the ideal store size as 35,000 sq ft to 65,000 sq ft, and
was celebrating the opening of its biggest-ever store, at 72,000 sq ft.
Capital expenditure for the year to February 1991 was Pounds 925m, and Tesco
said 'we continue to find a large number of opportunities to develop . . .
stores on quality sites.'
Contrast that with yesterday's assertion that 'it is widely understood that
currently there is a diminishing number of profitable prime superstore sites
available.'
Tesco added that it had to safeguard its returns on investment in the light
of growing pressure on margins.
The admissions are significant. Some analysts speculated when market leader
Sainsbury's launched its price-cutting programme in November that it might
have a 'hidden agenda'. Having recognised the over-capacity in the industry,
was it trying to force one or both of its main competitors to cut back their
expansion programmes, by putting pressure on margins?
Argyll and Tesco have indeed both responded. Argyll said last month it was
cutting capital spending this year from Pounds 650m to Pounds 550m, and
bowed to pressure to depreciate buildings over 40 years.
However, as one analyst put it yesterday: 'Argyll opened the door, and Tesco
charged through it.'
On depreciation, Tesco is following Argyll's lead and depreciating buildings
over 40 years. But it has also recognised that it paid 'premiums' for much
of its land above its alternative use value, and decided to amortise those
premiums over 25 years, leading to a total charge of Pounds 153m against
profits this year.
More significantly, it is cutting spending from Pounds 750m this year to a
projected Pounds 450m to Pounds 500m in the year to February 1997.
Floor space expansion will be cut back from 1.2m sq ft in 1991-92 to about
450,000 sq ft in 1996-97. Tesco also expects the average new store costs to
shrink from Pounds 22m to Pounds 16m over three years.
That reflects a shift away from out-of-town superstores towards the Metro
city centre format, and the 'compact' superstore format of about 20,000 sq
ft, aimed at market towns and city suburbs.
Mr David Reid, finance director, said he expected of 20 projected openings
in 1996-97, three or four would be Metros, seven or eight compact stores,
and the balance - less than half - larger superstores.
Tesco thinks there is scope for about 50 Metros - with nine planned by
September.
It admitted yesterday that it was looking at new trading formats, building
on Tesco's existing strengths in selling 'grocery and grocery-related
products'.
It will also be expanding the Catteau chain in France by up to six stores a
year, generally through organic growth. It claims not to have plans for
further large acquisitions overseas at present.
As UK expansion slows, more effort will go into maximising returns from
existing space. Tesco insists there is scope for 'significant savings' in
operating costs, which will then be reinvested in improving service to try
to enhance customers' loyalty and persuade them to spend more.
It claims some success in doing this already, through a combination of
introducing new services such as pharmacies, photo-processing, dry cleaning
and counter service for meat, trimming its prices, and introducing the Tesco
Value line, which offers basic goods at prices which rival the discounters.
Like-for-like sales for the first 20 weeks of the second half were up 4.5
per cent, which represented a 2.5 per cent gain in volume, after taking out
inflation of 2 per cent - better than it has achieved for some years.
The spotlight now shifts back to Sainsbury. It has been saying privately
that it saw no need to depreciate, but analysts believe it now has little
choice but to follow its rivals not only on that issue, but in calling a
halt - or at least a slowdown - in the race for space.

FT  20 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Signs of OFT approval for Granada bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There were growing signs last night that the Office of Fair Trading has
cleared the Granada bid for LWT, subject to the condition that the
advertising sales houses involved really do operate on an arms length basis.
The OFT decision on the bid, has, it is believed, now gone to Mr Michael
Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary.
The intention was to make an announcement today, but it is not clear whether
this will be possible because of Mr Heseltine's other commitments.
The Independent Television Commission has made it clear that it is prepared
to accept a system of Chinese Walls between sales houses for the time being,
as long as there are no shared directors or business contacts between the
two houses involved.
The ITC is reviewing the rules on advertising sales.

FT  20 JAN 94 / Elf Aquitaine sale to raise FFr35bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The privatisation of Elf Aquitaine, the oil company which is France's
largest industrial group, will be launched today with the start of the
pre-marketing period.
Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister, said yesterday: 'I have just
started the largest privatisation ever to take place in France.'
The sale of the majority of the state's 51 per cent stake is expected to
raise more than FFr35bn (Pounds 4bn). Mr Alphandery said the privatisation
issue would take place over the coming weeks, depending on market
conditions, and by April 20 at the latest.
From today, individual investors will be able to apply for shares in Elf. Of
the 60m shares to be offered for sale, 33m will be reserved for individual
investors and 27m allocated to institutional investors. A further 6.5m
shares will be offered on preferential terms to employees and former
employees.
In the case of excess demand, which occurred in last autumn's privatisations
of Banque Nationale de Paris and Rhone-Poulenc, the chemicals group, there
will be a clawback option for individual investors of up to 20 per cent of
the institutional tranche.
The number of shares available for institutional investors may also be
increased by up to 10 per cent by acquiring shares from Erap, the state
holding company.
The French government intends to retain, through Erap, about 13 per cent of
Elf's shares. In addition, there will be a placement of shares with a group
of long-term stable investors.
This group - known as a noyau dur - will hold about 10 per cent of the
equity and will protect the privatised group from predators and ensure
management stability.
Applications to participate in the group of core investors will close on
Monday. Members are expected to include leading French industrial and
financial groups such as Renault, Union des Assurances de Paris and the Suez
group. Core investors could also include Groupe Bruxelles Lambert of Belgium
and Union Bank of Switzerland.

FT  20 JAN 94 / Tesco reins in expansion plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tesco yesterday bowed to growing pressures in the grocery market and said it
was cutting its store opening programme, building smaller and cheaper
stores, and taking Pounds 153m charges on writing down land and buildings.
The statement by Sir Ian MacLaurin, Tesco chairman and one of the leaders of
the grocers' dash from the high street, effectively ended an era of
unbridled superstore expansion, backed by ever increasing profit margins.
'In my 10 years covering the sector, this is quite a historic day,' said one
analyst.
The UK's second largest grocery group admitted that increasing price
competition from discounters such as Aldi and Netto, coupled with the number
of superstores battling for customers, made it more difficult to make
adequate returns on new stores. 'Saturation of the market has been with us
for some time, and what you are seeing now is just a continuation of that,'
said Mr David Reid, finance director.
'Margins were going up between half and one (percentage) point a year, but
now they've fallen,' he added. 'This is a numbers game and the numbers have
changed.' He said Tesco's gross margin had first fallen as a result of its
own pricing initiatives, including introducing its Tesco Value range of
low-priced goods, and been trimmed further as the company responded to price
cutting by rivals Kwik Save and J Sainsbury.
Analysts estimate industry gross margins have fallen between 0.5 and 0.7
points.
In response, Tesco is changing its strategy and accounting policies. It is
following Argyll, the UK's number three, in depreciating its stores by 4 per
cent a year, leading to a Pounds 36m charge this year. It is also amortising
its land premiums - the difference between the price it paid and alternative
use value - at 2.5 per cent a year, with a Pounds 32m impact on profits.
Finally, it is making a one-off write-down of Pounds 85m on land it has
decided to sell instead of using for new stores.
Tesco is cutting back its capital spending from Pounds 750m this year to
between Pounds 450m and Pounds 500m in 1996-97. It will build fewer large
superstores, and more city-centre Metro stores and 'compact' superstores in
market towns and city suburbs. It is also investigating new formats.
The company unveiled an 11 per cent increase in total sales for the 20 weeks
to January 1, and a like-for-like increase of 4.5 per cent - its best
performance for some time.
Sir Ian said this reflected improvements to stores which had increased
customer loyalty and spending, as well as the launch of Tesco Value. 'There
is no point in customers' going to an Aldi or a Netto when they can buy the
basics as cheaply at Tesco, as well as all the other things Tesco sells,' he
said.

FT  20 JAN 94 / Kita takes the blame for Hanwa's big losses: The Japanese
group's withdrawal from speculation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO and WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Shigeru Kita has resigned as president of Hanwa, the Japanese steel
trading company, taking responsibility for huge investment losses in
financial markets.
The losses, blamed on the sharp fall in the Tokyo stock market, will result
in an extraordinary write-off of Y120bn (Pounds 720m) this year and an
after-tax loss forecast at Y47.2bn. This is believed to be one of the
largest write-offs related to financial transactions made by any Japanese
company.
Hanwa said the Y1,300bn funds still invested in financial instruments would
be withdrawn over three to four years, as it ceased all transactions aimed
at making profits on the financial markets. It would instead concentrate on
its core business of trading in steel and other products.
The decision by Hanwa, whose enormous influence on the financial markets at
one time earned it the nickname of 'shadow Bank of Japan', came as a stark
reminder of the damage wrought by speculative financial trading.
In particular, the resignation of Mr Kita, who will become a consultant to
the company, marks a humiliating end for a man whose keen financial instinct
once brought the company power and wealth. At its peak, speculative
financial trading, known as zaitech, supported record annual pre-tax profits
of Y38.4bn, of which more than 70 per cent came from non-operating profits.
Mr Kita will be succeeded initially by his elder brother, Mr Jiro Kita, who
is chairman. Mr Jiro Kita will resign both posts when his son, Mr Shuji
Kita, a former bureaucrat with the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry and managing director of Hanwa, assumes the helm in the near
future.
Mr Takashi Iwami, vice-president, said the company's core business of
trading in specialised steel products was firm, leaving its sales estimate
unchanged at Y570bn.
However, pre-tax profits would be Y11.7bn instead of the previously expected
Y4bn as losses from financial transactions would no longer arise at the
pre-tax level. The final dividend is being passed.

FT  20 JAN 94 / Return from high risk to historic core business
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
News of Hanwa's resolve to wash its hands of speculative financial
transactions reverberated through Japan's business and financial community
yesterday.
In its heyday, as a leading player in the stock and currency markets, Hanwa
enjoyed a formidable reputation. Its huge deals could send the currency
market into pandemonium and banks scurrying for cover.
Speculative transactions increased under the leadership of Mr Shigeru Kita,
who was known as the god of zaitech, or speculative financial trading. Mr
Kita, who took the helm in 1983, was widely regarded as a canny investor
,particularly after he correctly weakening in 1985. In early 1987 he
directed company funds away from speculative market transactions and back
towards its core in time to shield Hanwa from the worst effects of the stock
market crash.
Mr Kita had started the business - with two brothers - of selling steel to a
government scheme back in 1946 in war-ravaged Japan. But his natural
instinct for financial deals led him to dabble in real estate from the
earliest days of the company. In addition to being a leading investor in
stocks through specified money trusts, known as tokkin, and a feared
speculator in currencies, under Mr Kita's direction, Hanwa was also built up
Japan's commercial paper market. At the end of 1989 it accounted for up to
25 per cent of the entire market in Japan. The It provided huge profits by
allowing Hanwa to invest proceeds in short-term deposits at higher rates.
But the strategy started to unravel with the pricking of Japan's asset
bubble in the early months of the decade. By the spring of 1991, Hanwa began
to feel the effects of Japan's stock market fall. It reported appraisal
losses on its cross-shareholdings in other company's stock and on securities
investments.
One year later, Hanwa reported that it would halve the level of its
investment funds. It entered into a furious public and legal battle with
Yamatane Securities over a promise which Hanwa claims Yamatane had made to
repurchase securities after three months at a price that would yield a 12
per cent return. It demanded the securities firm repay Y4bn (Pounds 24.1m)
to cover the loss it had incurred.
At the end of last year, the company was further undermined by rumours that
Hanwa faced financially difficulties and had exceeded its limit on credit by
Y56.4bn.
The news sent Hanwa's share price plunging Y100 in one day late in December
to Y455, a far cry from the peak of Y3230 the shares reached on 1991. By the
end of December, Hanwa's share price had fallen to as low as Y387.
Hanwa's undoing by its own speculative ventures is all the more ironic since
the company's core business of trading in steel products has been a solid
one offering relatively high returns. The soundness of its main operations
and its finances (despite Y950bn of outstanding loans to banks) is attested
to by the fact that none of its banks, which are also major shareholders,
feel the need to send directors to assist Hanwa in its restructuring.
Rumours about its financial difficulties had been exaggerated and the share
price has recently started to recover.
Reflecting on the fate that befell the company, Mr Takashi Iwama,
vice-president, said yesterday that the decline of the Japanese stock
markets was the single most significant factor behind its current
misfortunes. Others were more inclined to blame lax management controls
which allowed the company to sink deeper and deeper into the speculative
frenzy of the late 1980s and the lack of strong direction from management
once things were clearly seen to be going wrong.
Although Hanwa's recent financial troubles were well known, the final
decision to admit failure and withdraw from financial transactions, which
generated huge profits in the past and in which it still has Y1.3 trillion
of outstanding funds invested, came as a surprise to many.
Ms Kathy Matsui, strategist at BZW in Tokyo, said that while 'Hanwa was
known to be in trouble, this created quite a shock.'
The lessons of Hanwa's experience are bound to have an effect on other
Japanese companies which were equally caught up in the speculative heat of
the late 1980s. While investments in tokkin specified money trusts and fund
trusts have already declined from a peak of Y43 trillion in February 1990 to
Y23 trillion last September, according to BZW estimates, the decline of
these investment techniques is bound to accelerate further, analysts say.
At the same time, cross-shareholdings, which have been a major support for
stock prices in Japan are likely to be affected by Hanwa's decision to sell
off assets. Hanwa is big enough to constitute a significant jump' in the
unwinding of cross-shareholdings, according to Mr James Jason, strategist at
James Capel in Tokyo.
But for corporate Japan, after years of busily pursuing one diversification
after another and one lucrative financial deal after another, the harshest
lesson may be the importance of focusing on core businesses. 'Hanwa had a
good reputation in the steel business,' says Mr Hiroyuki Suzuki, steel
analyst at Nomura Research Institute. 'We expect more companies to follow
its example and concentrate more assets on their original businesses.'

FT  20 JAN 94 / Bank in first 'repo' operation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bank of England yesterday held its first formal sale and repurchase  -
or 'repo' - of UK government bonds as part of its sterling money market
oper-ations, in an effort to iron out the volatility and liquidity problems
that have beset the market since the September 1992 sterling crisis.
The new procedures have already been tried and tested on a temporary basis
and complement the Bank's existing market operations, in which it accepts
bills from the banks in return for lending wholesale cash.
The Bank yesterday allotted Pounds 3.84bn in 21-day repos and Pounds 137m of
35-day repos, both at 5 13/32 per cent to be allocated and settled today.
This enables banks to borrow money from the Bank for three or five weeks at
a rate of 5 13/32 per cent using their gilt holdings as security.
While the Bundesbank's repo operations are closely watched by participants
in the European financial markets for hints about the direction of Germany's
key interest rates, the Bank of England's repo is unlikely to assume the
same significance. The Bank has stressed that the repo will not be used to
signal changes in monetary policy.
'The Bank of England's daily (bill) operations will continue to provide the
main focus,' says Mr Philip Shaw, an economist at Union Discount. But he
pointed out that if the liquidity shortages were reduced to such an extent
that the Bank did not need to hold an early round of assistance in the money
market, the repo rate would provide the first signal of the day - albeit
only on the twice-a-month repo dates.
When the Bank was forced to support sterling in autumn 1992, the heavy
intervention resulted in a large drain of liquidity from the money market.
As a result, daily shortages of more than Pounds 1bn have become a regular
occurrence.
The Bank introduced temporary repos to alleviate the problems. The intention
is to extend this repo facility to all banks and building societies, but
because of legal complications, this was not possible at yesterday's repo:
only the biggest banks and building societies, as well as the discount
houses and gilt-edged market makers, were able to participate.

FT  20 JAN 94 / Mid 250 driven to new peak
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, covering medium-sized companies on the London stock
market, was driven to a new peak yesterday by heavy options-related buying,
estimated at up to Pounds 1bn.
The sight of the Mid 250 leaping forward 135.5 to 4,148.8 helped drive the
FT-SE 100 Index of the UK's most highly valued companies to a new closing
peak of 3,475.1, up 38.1 points.
Senior traders said UBS, the Swiss-owned securities house, had been buying
Mid 250 stocks ferociously since the end of last week, ahead of the issue of
a large covered warrant on the index. A warrant is a derivative instrument
which allows investors to exercise an option to buy the underlying shares at
the price on the day of purchase.
Dealers believed that word of the strategy leaked into the London market
yesterday morning, prompting rival dealers to mark up share prices, and
triggering a rush of buying by UBS in the afternoon as it sought to complete
its order.
The head trader at a leading UK securities house commented: 'It's been an
opportunity to lose a fortune - you couldn't buy anything for love nor
money. This is the latest in a chain of events pointing to the increasing
importance of derivatives and other instruments.'
UBS was said to have been keen to carry out the deal ahead of the February 4
launch of OMLX, a London-based equity derivatives exchange which plans to
deal in Mid 250 contracts.
SG Warburg Securities and NatWest Securities were also said to have been
active.

FT  20 JAN 94 / Quake damage may hit Dollars 30bn: Clinton pledges federal
aid as he tours devastated areas of LA
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
As President Bill Clinton toured devastated areas of Los Angeles yesterday,
damage estimates from Monday's earthquake rose as high as Dollars 30bn
(Pounds 20.2bn) - making it the most costly disaster in US history.
Mr Clinton, who was met by a sharp after-shock as he surveyed a collapsed
freeway bridge, promised 'unusual and unprecedented' federal relief funds,
including an initial, immediate payment of Dollars 45m for highway repairs
and Dollars 239m in low interest loans to small businesses.
After talking to groups of residents gathered along his route through some
of the most badly hit areas of the San Fernando Valley, the president
addressed officials and residents at the Burbank airport.
Earlier yesterday, California's Governor, Mr Pete Wilson, told the Federal
Emergency Management Agency that the total cost of the quake could be
anywhere between Dollars 15bn and Dollars 30bn. His figures were in part
derived from estimates provided to the state by EQE International, a San
Francisco engineering consultancy firm that specialises in assessing natural
disaster risks.
Mr Earl Aurelius, vice-president of EQE, said the preliminary estimate of
damage was Dollars 15.1bn, excluding business losses. Of that, he estimated
that between Dollars 1.5bn and Dollars 1.9bn was covered by insurance.
EQE has used a computer model, combined with the observations of 30 of its
engineers, to assess the damage. 'We are feeling increasingly comfortable
with our Dollars 15.1bn estimate as we get further reports from the field,'
Mr Aurelius said.
Damage was far more serious than in the 1989 San Francisco bay area
earthquake, where costs rose to Dollars 7bn, because of the higher
concentration of properties near the epicentre, he said.
A spokesman for the governor said the estimates were preliminary, but the
Dollars 15bn to Dollars 30bn estimate provided a good 'ballpark'.
Although severe damage is limited to the western and north western parts of
the city, it is nonetheless overwhelming. The Federal Emergency Management
Agency said it expected to spend at least Dollars 1bn on repairs. The
California Transportation Department says repairs to freeways will cost at
least Dollars 100m, an estimate that is expected to double or triple as more
structural damage is revealed. Whatever the cost, it will take time -
probably years - to undo what the forces of nature accomplished in less than
a minute. On Tuesday, crews began demolishing quake-torn overpasses on the
Santa Monica and Golden State freeways. Working around the clock, they hope
to have the structures down in about a week. Rebuilding will take about a
year.
Workers also struggled yesterday to mend the San Fernando Valley's wrecked
aqueducts as water in the lone reservoir serving the area dwindled. Ruptured
aqueducts have cut off much of the water supply to the 260-square-mile
suburban expanse hardest hit by the quake.

FT  20 JAN 94 / Howard signals changes in courts reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, ALAN PIKE and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government was preparing yesterday to water down plans to reform the
police and courts in the face of growing opposition in the House of Lords to
key aspects of its legislative programme.
Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, signalled the climbdown after Lord
Whitelaw, a former Conservative home secretary, attacked the police and
magistrates' courts bill for the second time in two days.
Mr Howard, who defended the bill after it was mauled by Conservative critics
in the Lords on Tuesday, said he was 'prepared to listen to detailed
suggestions which might improve upon the form of legislation'.
The government's problems in the upper house were compounded by Lord Taylor
of Gosforth, the Lord Chief Justice, who criticised a key aspect of Mr
Howard's plans to reform the so-called right to silence.
Lord Taylor said there was 'nothing unfair' about proposals in the criminal
justice bill that juries in criminal trials should be told that defendants
had refused to answer police questions.
But the government's proposal that judges should demonstrate a defendant's
unwillingness to give evidence by calling him or her to the witness box
could produce 'undesirable and unfair results'.
Lord Taylor's comments suggest the law and order measures face a rough ride
in the Lords, which has also criticised proposals in the education bill to
reform student unions.
The growing difficulties in the upper house are a fresh blow to Mr John
Major's back to basics initiative to encourage a return to traditional
values. Senior officials conceded it would be 'difficult' to persuade peers
to accept proposals in the deregulation bill, published yesterday, to give
ministers sweeping powers to repeal existing legislation.
The depth of opposition to the police and magistrates' courts bill surprised
ministers, who had taken little heed of widespread criticism from police and
magistrates' associations.
Most of the opposition centres on proposals to give the home secretary
powers to appoint five of the 16 members of newly-formed local police
authorities, including the chairman, and to put magistrates' clerks on fixed
term contracts. Critics claim the proposals would reduce the operational
independence of chief constables and expose clerks to the possibility of
pressure from ministers or officials.
Mr Howard assured the Commons home affairs committee last night that the
five appointed members would not be 'party political placements'.
There was fresh embarrassment for the government last night when it admitted
that not one of the 360 letters it received from organisations on the
composition of police authorities fully supported its proposed changes.

FT  20 JAN 94 / Japan faces ballot on reform after compromise talks fail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's governing coalition is to call a parliamentary vote on plans to
reform the scandal-prone political system.
The decision follows the collapse last night of negotiations for a
compromise with the opposition Liberal Democratic party.
If successful, the ballot in a committee of the upper house of parliament
will pave the way for a vote by the full house by the end of the week. That
is the final stage before the enactment of the four bills, which will bring
the biggest change to the organisation of Japanese democracy since the war.
Political suspense of this kind is relatively new to Japan, after 38 years
of LDP rule which ended last July. The horse-trading has forced the
government to delay an urgently needed package to stimulate the economy.
The vote will be close, as the upper house majority of the seven-party
coalition is smaller than that in the lower chamber, where it won a showdown
about reform two months ago. It also faces defections from both sides of the
upper house.
Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, prime minister, said last night he was still prepared
to meet Mr Yohei Kono, LDP president, in a final attempt to strike a deal.
'Even if the upper house committee votes on the bills, we're still going to
have our leadership talk.'
Members of the coalition and the LDP had made little progress during three
meetings earlier in the day. If the bills do not pass parliament by midnight
tomorrow they will expire, making it very hard for Mr Hosokawa to meet his
self-imposed deadline of achieving political reform by the end of the month.
Yet Mr Hosokawa's scope to strike an eleventh-hour deal on reform with the
LDP is limited by the risk he runs of offending the Social Democratic party,
the coalition's biggest partner. Also, Mr Kono is so unpopular in his own
LDP ranks, and his party so divided, that he might be incapable of enforcing
any deal.
Several LDP members opposed to reform suggested Mr Kono might face a vote of
no confidence. Yesterday's talks centred on an LDP proposal that the number
of lower house members elected from single-seat constituencies should be
increased from the coalition's planned 274 to 280, and those chosen by
proportional representation from 226 to 230.
The LDP compromise would create a 510-seat parliament, nearly the same size
as the current (511-seat) chamber, so neutralising opposition from
politicians who fear losing their seats.
The LDP wants the coalition to lift the proposed ban on corporate funding
for individual politicians, a change calculated to suit the LDP. It also
wants the coalition to maintain the ban on house-to-house canvassing.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Intel is getting into the habit of releasing results which unsettle the
equity market. Yesterday's fall in the shares following the release of
full-year figures was as great as the correction which greeted the
third-quarter results in October. Slightly lower than anticipated earnings -
despite an unexpected financing gain related to a new plant in Ireland - was
the immediate cause. But it is a measure of the high expectations of Intel's
growth prospects that even minor disappointments can cause such an upset.
The immediate question is whether Intel can sell enough of its new Pentium
microprocessors to justify the costs sunk into research and manufacturing.
The company's comment yesterday that shipments are running to schedule is
comforting. With capital spending running at Dollars 2bn a year, though,
Pentium chips need to take around 15 per cent of the world personal computer
market this year if Intel is to make a decent return on that investment.
Competition in the past generation of chips from AMD make it all the more
important for Intel to drive the market forward, particularly with IBM
likely to enter the market before too long. While Intel's shares have
outperformed the US market by 80 per cent over the last 18 months, the long
term challengers to its market dominance are only starting to gather
momentum.

FT  20 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Bank of England
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bank of England's new repurchase operation seems to be an
acknowledgement of the deficiencies of the commercial bill market. Monetary
objectives require the Bank of England to lend to the private sector.
Prudence requires the Bank to secure that lending against readily available
collateral. Yet since the government's monetary manipulation of the early
1980s, when the Bank drained many of the bills from the market, the
commercial bills traditionally used as collateral have become less liquid.
As a result, the money market has become more volatile and adding money to
the banking system has become more difficult.
One option would be to use gilts as collateral, though this might require
the development of a full-scale repurchase market. Besides the tax
complications of this, it could also undermine the existing stock lenders
which serve both the gilt and equity markets. That would have knock-on
consequences on a scale which would make the Bank wonder whether wholesale
reform of that kind was worth the candle.
The Bank's inelegant but practical half-way house is to add medium-term gilt
repurchases to the existing bill operations. This may hold the line for some
time. This means that the Bank will continue to signal interest rate changes
in the same way as before.
Nor will the fact that a repo has recently been completed deter the Bank
from changing policy, as some suggest. After all, an informal repo was
completed the day before the last interest rate cut. Volatility may also
persist, given that commercial banks will still be able to throw their
weight about. So a full switch to gilt repos may yet be needed to iron out
the historical quirks of the money market.

FT  20 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: UK economy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is strange that the UK equity market should get into such a lather over
yesterday's economic figures. Retail sales last month were certainly poorer
than suggested by either the CBI or retailers' gossip. But annual sales
growth is still running at 4 per cent in volume terms. That is unlikely to
drive the chancellor to an early interest rate cut, at least while other
economic indicators are pointing in the right direction. The December sales
figures should anyway be treated cautiously, since Christmas poses
particular problems for the Central Statistical Office, as the large
revision to the December 1992 data confirms.
Reassuring news on inflation might leave the chancellor with more room to
cut rates should the economy take a turn for the worse. Underlying inflation
of 2.7 per cent presents no immediate threat. That said, eight of the 14
categories in the retail prices index are still rising at an annual rate of
more than 3 per cent. Even allowing for the impact of higher taxes on the
latest figures, this is a reminder that inflation has been subdued rather
than vanquished.
With sterling sliding below DM2.61 yesterday, the chancellor does not need
to cut rates to hold the currency down. On that basis, the excitement in
equities - including a 135-point rise in the FT-SE Mid 250 index - arose
from something other than a cool assessment of the economic outlook. If a
widespread shortage of stock throughout the London market is to blame, that
gain could quickly be reversed.

FT  20 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Tesco's choice cuts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Given that the market had already discounted Tesco's asset values, the food
retailer's move to depreciate its land and buildings comes as a belated
recognition of reality. Tesco should have made the changes long ago. Still,
choosing the precise depreciation rate to apply to a superstore site is a
tricky problem, given that none have been open long enough to judge their
useful life. Tesco has been reassuringly conservative in implying that the
average price paid for its land is twice the alternative use value.
This realism is welcome. But that scarcely makes the shares more attractive,
despite the promises of scaled back capital expenditure and higher income
growth. Having extracted Pounds 572m from shareholders three years ago,
Tesco will now try to slip the cash back through higher dividends. Given the
shares have underperformed the market by 38 per cent since the fund-raising,
that seems a sensible thing to do. Tesco can afford to lift dividends faster
than earnings. But earnings are likely to go nowhere. So unless pressures in
the grocery market ease or inflation returns with a vengeance, Tesco's
shares will remain becalmed.
J. Sainsbury's response will be interesting. It may be tempted to exploit
its market leadership and accelerate its store opening programme. Sites will
be cheaper and the attrition rate will ease. But Sainsbury faces the same
competitive challenges as the rest of the industry. It, too, will come under
pressure to modify fair-weather accounting policies, and start to depreciate
its land and buildings.

FT  20 JAN 94 / Mud-flinging finds vulnerable targets: The withdrawal of
Clinton's defence-secretary nominee highlights White House troubles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If the manner of Bobby Ray Inman's acceptance last month of President Bill
Clinton's offer to run the defence department was peculiar (he arrogantly
said he had to find a 'comfort level' with the president and then
gratuitously added he had voted for George Bush), then his performance on
Tuesday explaining why he was withdrawing from the nomination was downright
bizarre.
But sometimes messengers do come in strange forms. And in the near-paranoid
rationale that Mr Inman offered - accusing the media and politicians alike
of a 'modern McCarthyism' and saying that he was unwilling to accept the
'garbage' of scrutiny that now came with public service - there could be
found some truths that ought to trouble both the president and the
Washington establishment.
Among them are the chronic problems this administration has in making senior
appointments, especially in the foreign and security fields; the extent to
which the minutiae of an individual's private life can be considered
disqualifications for government service; and the curious phenomenon that
this president seems snake-bitten, unable to string together for more than a
few weeks a confidence-building record without being stuck in some poisonous
new controversy or another.
The most immediate concern is Mr Clinton's own 'comfort level' with the US
military establishment, now awaiting a third secretary of defence in a year.
This is, after all, a president who never served in uniform and who opposed
the war in Vietnam, but who has already asked much of his military - to end
its ban on homosexuals, to cut its budget and bases, to realign its force
structure, to serve in distant hot spots not always with clear direction, as
in Somalia, and to cohabit, in Nato's Partnership for Peace, with old foes
from the former Warsaw Pact.
Les Aspin, the outgoing secretary, was somehow thought not quite up to
implementing these policies. Mr Inman, a veteran of the Navy, the CIA and
the shadowy Washington intelligence community, was almost universally seen
as the perfect solution. Even though he had been out of government since
1982, he was always breezing into the capital from Texas, keeping his many
contacts alive. Even a less than glittering business career, including
association with James Guerin's International Signals and Controls, seemed a
minor matter in the eyes of Congress, because it thought it knew him.
Yet the truth seems to be that the Clinton team's knowledge of Mr Inman was
confined to his resume and secondhand reputation. Perhaps the president
himself, so proud of his own persuasive abilities, missed warning signals
when the two men first talked about the job. But perhaps the admiral never
revealed then what he said on Tuesday: that he had lost his enthusiasm for
military affairs and, in any case, had reservations about the extent of the
cuts in the defence budget.
Whatever the reality, Mr Clinton ended up with the worst of both worlds:
having nominated a man who would have been unsackable in office, he had no
control over his extraordinary second thoughts about taking the position at
all. Presidents are not supposed to get themselves into this sort of bind.
As it now stands, the civilian command at the Pentagon is in disarray. The
Aspin team, never fully complete anyway, expected to be dismembered by Mr
Inman and one of them, Morton Halperin, nominated but never confirmed to run
a new peacekeeping and human rights division, had already fallen on his
sword and withdrawn. The military side, too, is under the new management of
General John Shalikashvili, chairman of the joint chiefs. The ship is not
happy, whether the men are wearing suits or uniforms.
The same is true, to a degree, of the state department, where prominent
heads have either rolled - Clifton Wharton, ex-deputy secretary, Samuel
Lewis, ex-policy planning chief, and Warren Zimmerman, ex-head of refugee
programmes - or are hanging by a thread, like Tim Wirth. The former senator
from Colorado was appointed to run a new division for global affairs, but
its authorisation is still held up by congressional conservatives, and
Warren Christopher, secretary of state, is believed to be growing cool to
the reorganisation, preferring instead a department run by regional tsars
and new stars like Strobe Talbott, the deputy secretary-designate.
Second, the Inman affair highlights the appalling selection problems the
Clinton administration has encountered, many of its own making. Ever since
Ms Zoe Baird, the first nominee to be attorney general, fell foul of
Nannygate a year ago, the White House has been running scared of skeletons
in closets, including, as Mr Inman noted, memberships of clubs that are not
politically correct. At the same time, it has continued to insist on putting
forward minority and women candidates for as many positions as possible.
The extensive nature of the background checks on prospective nominees has
acquired an intrusiveness capable of discouraging those with far thicker
skins than Mr Inman's. Worse, the White House personnel office, directed by
Bruce Lindsey, an old presidential friend, and through which appointments
pass en route to the Oval Office, has been almost cruelly self-indulgent in
allowing candidate files to stack up without response, as any number of
bitter denizens of Washington will attest.
Additionally, conservative politicians and their media allies, copying the
tactics of their liberal counterparts in the Reagan-Bush presidencies, have
relentlessly pursued those they dislike - like Mr Halperin and Lani Guinier,
nominated to the justice department's civil rights division. In the process,
they have discovered that the current administration is not always prepared
to fight for those it wants on board. Thus, as it enters its second year,
barely half of the nearly 1,000 senior jobs subject to Senate confirmation
have been actually filled, a sorry record that does the administration's
reputation in the capital no good.
Third, Mr Inman's assault on the press, specifically the New York Times and
William Safire, its columnist, suggests one of two things: that he could not
stand the heat of criticism - on the basis of his press conference an
entirely reasonable conclusion and an indictment of the president for
picking him for such an important position; or that media headhunting has
lost all sense of proportion, which is at least arguable.
Mr Inman did not exactly help his own case by saying he believed there was
an unholy conspiracy between Senator Bob Dole, the Republican leader, and Mr
Safire, whereby the politician would create trouble for his nomination and
the columnist would go after the Whitewater affair, the tangled skein of the
Clintons' Arkansas real estate venture.
But their natural denial of any such complicity cannot disguise the fact
that relations between the media, particularly the White House press corps,
and the president are still sour, and were made no better in Europe last
week by Mr Clinton's refusal to answer Whitewater questions. The White House
media charm offensive, including remarkable access to the president's table
and private movie theatre, has not succeeded, but perhaps it never could
have in the current media mood. The tenor of much of its coverage of his
European tour was reflexively critical, and even if many reporters have
doubts about the seriousness of Whitewater they are now almost duty-bound to
pursue this classic paper chase.
This hostility still does not approach the current UK level, perhaps because
Mr Clinton's poll standings are more than twice as high as Prime Minister
John Major's. But praising the president is not popular in macho media
circles, as witnessed this week in a singularly nasty attack in the
Washington Post on a New Yorker magazine writer for producing 'cream puffs'
about the president's first year.
Mr Clinton may console himself that he is well rid of the bizarre Bobby Ray
Inman, but he is still left with a problem. He may have no alternative but
to follow the practice of Capt Renault in Casablanca, round up the usual
suspects and hope that one of them actually wants the job. It is not a good
way to start a second year in office.

Dashiell Hammett must be spinning in his grave. Preventing Homicide in the
Workplace, published by the US National Institute for Occupational Safety
and Health, has demolished the myth that being a gumshoe is the world's most
dangerous profession. Taxi drivers run the greatest risk of being murdered
at work. Between 1980 and 1989 the average annual murder rate of cab drivers
was 27 in 100,000; most were shot. The next most perilous jobs were liquor
store workers and petrol station attendants. Private detectives came a
rather lame fourth.

Sir Tim Lankester's straight-talking is tame stuff compared with the latest
outburst by David Marshall, just back in Singapore after 15 years as
Singapore's ambassador in Paris.
Singapore-born Marshall is unimpressed by modern Singapore and its ruling
Peoples Action party. His latest verdict is that censorship is worse,
broader and more strict than at any time under British rule. He should know;
he was chief minister of the first local government, formed under the old
British colonial administration.
He also berated Lee Kuan Yew, former prime minister of the island republic,
for brushing aside public spiritedness and encouraging Singaporeans to
worship the 'golden calf' of financial gain.
Lesser diplomats might have shied away from such bluntness, especially in a
disciplinarian society like Singapore. But Marshall is a sprightly 86 and
has probably given up hope of further diplomatic advancement.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Top civil servants don't normally like to rile their prime ministers, but
then Sir Tim Lankester is hardly a conventional bureaucrat. As head of
Britain's Overseas Development Administration, Lankester has thumbed his
nose at John Major by saying British taxpayers' money was wasted on
Malaysia's Pergau dam project.
Lankester has long had the habit of giving a straight answer to a straight
question, which endeared him both to Jim Callaghan and Margaret Thatcher
when he was their private secretary.
His obsession with third world affairs comes from his seven-year stint as a
World Bank economist. An interest in development economics was sparked off
by Arthur Lewis of the University of the West Indies during a spell as a VSO
teacher in Belize. On returning there 30 years later Lankester was delighted
to find that two former pupils were now governor of the central bank and
permanent secretary at the finance ministry.
The end of January sees him moving to far less congenial waters, as
permanent secretary at the Department for Education, where his role is to
help save the neck of education secretary John Patten. Time for more
straight talking?

Meanwhile, John Major's slogans may be confusing British MPs no end, but
their continental counterparts retain clearer heads.
Wolfgang Schauble, the wheelchair-bound but highly combative parliamentary
leader of Germany's Christian Democrats, was talking about ways to counter a
general disenchantment with politics. He lauded the benefits of national
solidarity, traditional values and institutions.
So was this back to basics a la Major, a British journalist wanted to know.
'I can assure you that my marital relations are perfectly stable,' came the
speedy riposte.

O'Donnell, the prime minister's outgoing press secretary. Presumably, guests
not only will keep their mouths shut but they will be required to open their

Jean-Claude Trichet, governor of the newly independent Bank of France, has
made much of his plans to appear regularly before the National Assembly,
thus balancing the fact that he is no longer under the executive's thumb by
making himself 'democratically accountable' to the legislature.
But who would have thought that his first parliamentary appearance since the
central bank's transmogrification would have been before the German
Bundestag? Is that not taking independence a scintilla too literally?
Apparently it was just unfortunate that, owing to the assembly's crowded
calendar, the boss had to wait to testify at home until his February 2
appearance before the finance committee.
Still, whatever the logistics, yesterday's cameo appearance in Bonn cannot
but reinforce the unfortunate impression of Germany's out and out dominance
of European monetary policy.

FT  20 JAN 94 / Leading Article: Strife in Mexico
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The new-year rebellion in southern Mexico has subsided for the moment, but
the aftershocks will reverberate beyond presidential elections due in
August. Unless Mexican leaders reach the right conclusions about their
authoritarian political system, the remarkable economic progress they have
made in recent years will be in jeopardy.
It is no accident that the peasant uprising occurred in the state of
Chiapas, Mexico's most oppressed and impoverished corner where the ruling
Institutional Revolutionary party regularly polls 90 per cent of electoral
votes. The events are a reminder that much of Mexico is decades away from
the image of a modern society that President Carlos Salinas cultivated as
part of his campaign to secure the North American Free Trade Agreement. They
underline that many Mexicans have been left behind by his economic reform
programme and remain deeply suspicious of it.
Mr Salinas must take his share of responsibility for the crisis. He ignored
indications of impending insurgency, apparently fearful of drawing attention
to an issue that could have affected the Nafta vote last November in the US.
He tolerated one of the most autocratic state governments in Mexico, which
repressed, sometimes brutally, even peaceful opposition. It was he who a
year ago promoted the previous governor - the hard-line Mr Patrocinio
Gonzalez Garrido - to head the country's interior ministry.
The president has now sacked Mr Gonzalez Garrido. His initial response - to
suppress the uprising by military force - has given way to a more
conciliatory approach, encouraged perhaps by the international scrutiny that
has followed his attempt to integrate Mexico into the world economy.
But Mr Salinas and his designated candidate for the presidential elections,
Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio, need to draw more fundamental lessons from the
uprising. The conditions that led to the crisis in Chiapas are to a greater
or lesser extent present in the rest of Mexico. Whatever Mr Salinas's
successes in economic reform, much of Mexico's public administration remains
arrogant, corrupt and unresponsive to popular needs. What is more, Mexicans
have few rights of redress against the excesses of government, the police or
the military: the legal system is arbitrary, inefficient and under the
government's thumb.
Mr Salinas has tried to draw a tidy line between economic and political
reform: he has embraced the former and tried to fend off the latter. But
Chiapas shows economic development in Latin America cannot be superimposed
on to a political system which in some ways verges on the feudal.
International investors - central to Mexico's development - avoid countries
riven by social strife. Mexico's authoritarian approach no longer supports
the necessary task of modernising Mexico's economy - if it ever did. It has
weakened the process and deprived it of legitimacy.
Surprisingly, Mr Colosio, the presidential candidate, has given no
indication of his views on the current crisis. He has spoken in the past
about decentralising government, but - given what Chiapas indicates about
the quality of Mexico's regional governments - that raises more questions
than it answers. He needs to give a lead now, one that points Mexico firmly
towards true democracy and respect for the rule of law. Without such an
initiative, the spectre of social upheaval will continue to threaten Mr
Salinas's bold attempt to modernise his country.

FT  20 JAN 94 / Personal View: Why the west must plug Russia's gap
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JACEK ROSTOWSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In spite of the soothing voices of the experts, it is time to start
panicking about Russia. There is still time to stop the fascists from taking
power. But if they do, the west will, at the very least, have to engage in
an extremely expensive policy of containment. Just as a botched peace after
the first world war led to the second, so a botched peace after the cold war
will lead to a second cold war, unless Russia's transition to a reasonably
prosperous and stable society is managed successfully.
It is thus of vital western strategic interest to help Russians achieve this
transition. The first thing to be done is to take western management of
assistance to Russia out of the hands of the International Monetary Fund and
the World Bank. The international financial organisations can continue
providing technical support for the reforms, but the key decisions must be
political - it is unfair to ask international bureaucrats, however talented,
to make decisions requiring them to bend, if not violate, the operating
procedures of their institutions.
Aid for Russia is politically motivated, and there should be little pretence
it is otherwise. It should be large scale, of the order of Dollars 30bn a
year for about five years, so that Russian voters will be clear that, if
they vote in a fascist or nationalist-communist government, they will lose
this aid and cause themselves significant economic loss. The aid should be
in the form of grants - to avoid nationalist claims that Russia could
improve its situation by repudiating its debt. Finally, it should be
carefully politically targeted.
The west as a whole can afford such expenditure, which amounts to some 7 per
cent of total western defence expenditure, or one-fifth of 1 per cent of
total western gross domestic product. It works out at about Dollars 50
(Pounds 30) per person a year.
It is not true that such aid can make no difference to the situation in
Russia. At the current exchange rate, Dollars 30bn would increase Russia's
GDP by some 12 per cent. Russian healthcare expenditure totals about 3 per
cent of GDP, while remaining social expenditure accounts for about 9 per
cent.
A priority must be to improve the living standards of Russia's officer
class, which voted massively for Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the ultra-nationalist
Liberal Democrat leader. Every married officer should be guaranteed a flat
within five years. At present there are cases of full colonels with families
living in squalid two-room accommodation inside hospitals. With 250,000
commissioned officers in the army, the programme would cost less than
Dollars 10bn.
A second vital western interest is to reduce the dangers of conflict on
Russia's borders. This requires the economic, though not military,
strengthening of Ukraine. The economic situation there is worse than in
Russia, and economic and political collapse, which could suck in even a
moderate Russian government, is a present danger. Ukraine claims to need
some Dollars 7.5bn worth of Russian oil and gas a year. Financing much of
this would strengthen Ukraine and help Russia economically. A similar
situation, though on a smaller scale, holds in the Baltics.
But the most important thing is to control Russia's inflation. For political
reasons, though, this must be achieved with less structural change at the
beginning of the stabilisation than has occurred in central Europe.
Inflation must be controlled, because at 20 per cent a month it is
politically disastrous for the incumbent government. Since prices do not
rise uniformly, large changes in relative prices and incomes cause acute
anxiety. High inflation was a big reason for the large vote for the
authoritarian parties in Russia. Moreover, it is unimaginable that the kind
of investment in new ventures which Russia needs if the economy is to
improve will be forthcoming in such a chaotic environment.
Unfortunately, Russia cannot learn to live with inflation through widespread
indexation, as some other countries have, because of the huge amount of
expenditure financed by the inflation tax (the cost of inflation to those
holding money). This is some 25 per cent of GDP. Widespread indexation would
eliminate the tax base of the inflation tax, accelerating inflation to
astronomical levels.
The solution is for western aid to fill the gap. Only in this way can Russia
achieve the politically necessary reduction in inflation while avoiding the
politically perilous structural shock which would otherwise result from the
required massive cutting of subsidies to state enterprises.

FT  20 JAN 94 / Leading Article: Old thinking
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In December 1992 Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, stunned
the world with a fiercely nationalistic speech. He publicly renounced
previous pro-western policies, demanded an end to the arms embargo on
Serbia, and accused western countries of planning to strengthen their
military presence in the Baltic and other regions 'on the territory of the
former Soviet Union'.
Forty-five minutes later he announced that it had all been a hoax, intended
to warn the west what sort of foreign policy it could expect if President
Boris Yeltsin were to fall. Neither Mr Yeltsin 'nor I myself, as minister
for foreign affairs, would ever agree with what I read out in my previous
statement', he added.
Not everyone saw the joke at the time, and it has become steadily less
amusing since. The Mr Kozyrev who is still foreign minister in 1994 sounds
more like the 'hoax' than the 'real' Mr Kozyrev of 1992. Russian troops
should not withdraw, he declared on Tuesday, from regions 'which have been
in the sphere of Russian interests for centuries'.
Both main Russian news agencies reported this statement as including the
Baltic states, which would have directly contradicted assurances given to
President Bill Clinton by Mr Yeltsin last week. Let us hope the agencies
were mistaken, as Mr Kozyrev's office yesterday insisted they were. Even so
the language used is chilling, as is the blithe assumption that Russian
interests must prevail over the wishes of neighbouring states which Russia
has recognised as sovereign. If Mr Kozyrev wanted to put the case for an
enlarged Nato, with guarantees to states that feel threatened by Russia, he
could hardly have done it better.

FT  20 JAN 94 / Leading Article: First blood in red tape war
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Red tape is like jungle undergrowth. From time to time, politicians hack it
back in their frustration. But as soon as their attention is distracted, the
red tape creeps back again.
The British government yesterday announced measures, including a
deregulation bill, designed to put its campaign against red tape on a
permanent footing. Not only have ministers drawn up a hit-list of
regulations to be scrapped. Procedures are to be adopted to stop regulation
creeping back.
Cutting red tape is important if business is to be free to focus on wealth
creation. Small businesses, in particular, find constant form-filling saps
their energy and diverts them from running their companies.
Much of the blame for over regulation has been attributed to Brussels. But
Whitehall is as big a culprit, often elaborating European directives with
reams of detailed prescriptions. There is also a tendency to respond to the
latest scandal or disaster by drawing up regulations without assessing
costs. The result is that, though the Tories have promised to cut red tape
since they came into power in 1979, regulation is more pervasive than ever.
Hence the need for a new approach. The centrepiece of this is a plan for
ministers to be given so-called Henry VIII powers, allowing them to scrap
many regulations without having to pass new primary legislation. The aim of
this fast-track procedure is to clear out the accumulated mass of
out-of-date rules without clogging up the parliamentary timetable.
Other measures include a promise that new regulations will be subjected to a
'small business litmus test'. This will involve consulting with two or three
typical small firms to ensure that the cost of complying with rules does not
outweigh the benefits. There will also be a new deregulation task force
under Mr Francis Maude, the former junior minister, to drive the initiative
forward.
The most controversial measure is undoubtedly the proposed Henry VIII power.
The government has sought to deflect criticism that it is seeking to rule by
decree by building in safeguards over how this power will be exercised.
Before a regulation is scrapped, there will be public consultation, a
breathing space of 40 days and debates in both houses of parliament. While
this procedure will take the sting out of the criticism that ministers are
behaving undemocratically, more could be done to ensure accountability. For
example, a new select committee or standing committee for deregulation could
be established to scrutinise ministerial proposals in detail.
By contrast, the government's hit-list of regulations to be abolished is not
that controversial. Some of the most useful, such as the promise to scrap
compulsory audits for companies with a turnover of under Pounds 90,000, have
already been announced. Other proposals, such as that permitting Scottish
barbers to open on Sundays, are small beer.
The main political fights will come when ministers address health and safety
regulations. These were not tackled yesterday because the government is
still waiting for conclusions from a Health and Safety Executive study.
While ministers claim they are not deliberately ducking the issue, the
absence of specific proposals in this area should certainly help smooth the
passage of the legislation.
Though the government has taken a welcome first step in its deregulation
initiative, there is no guarantee of success. The challenge will be to
maintain momentum.

FT  20 JAN 94 / Economic Viewpoint: The UK upturn is genuine, but . . .
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I pity anyone trying to make up his mind about the trend of the British or
any other economy on the basis of the spot indicators which appear every few
days. The industrial production index published on Monday looked like 'boom,
boom Britain'. Then the December retail sales published yesterday were
judged to be 'disappointing'. This last instant judgment restarted misguided
speculation on base-rate cuts, which served the government's purpose as they
took a little bit of the froth out of the upward movement in sterling.
Some readers may remember my 'Teenagers' Guides' to key indicators. Their
main purpose was to provide a do-it-yourself guide to interested readers.
The first clue is the familiar Whitehall warning not to take a single
month's figures on their own - which does not mean ignoring them, but seeing
what effect they have on previous trends. Another clue is to take together
indicators on related subjects.
Most important, one has to be wise to the snags in particular series. An
example is North Sea oil. This is a genuine part of UK output and not the
mirage that the more puritanical commentators suppose. But it just so
happens that oil output moves in a jerky manner as rigs are taken in and out
of action. This bug affects both the production index and gross domestic
product.
I am not normally accused of partiality towards manufacturing; but for this
reason the index of manufacturing output, which excludes energy, is a much
better guide than the total index of production. For instance, the
production index increased at an annualised rate of almost 5 per cent in the
three months to November. Manufacturing alone increased at an annualised
rate of 3.2 per cent, and 1.8 per cent over the same period a year before.
The best guess lies somewhere in the 2-3 per cent range.
This caution will be especially necessary when the Central Statistical
Office's flash estimate of fourth quarter GDP is published tomorrow. Search
for the estimate excluding the North Sea sector, and show the door to any
adviser or analyst who overlooks the distinction.
The broad picture is already clear. It is of an economic recovery which
Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, says is no longer even patchy. Inflation
remains subdued; the core rate, excluding excise duties as as well as
mortgage in-terest payments, has almost certainly fallen further.
The big question is how far the delayed tax increases imposed in the two
1993 Budgets are going to depress consumer spending. The Treasury Committee
rightly criticised the fiscal presentation of the last Budget as being
peculiarly difficult to fathom.
The adjoining table is an attempt to fill the gap by one of the committee's
advisers, Bill Martin. He argues that the spending cuts, up to and including
1995, are due to lower unemployment and inflation than previously projected
rather than real reductions. But, even taking spending cuts at their face
value, tax increases are overwhelmingly more important in the government's
deficit reduction plan.
The committee's report emphasises the severity of the tax increases by
saying they were equivalent to a 7 per cent increase in the basic rate.
Martin, on the other hand, maintains that they are less than the increases
in Geoffrey Howe's controversial 1981 Budget imposed at the trough of the
earlier recession. The moral he draws is that the short-run impact of even
large budgetary shocks can easily be outweighed by other business cycle
forces. This time Martin believes that the delayed impact of the
post-exchange rate mechanism interest rate cuts will more than offset the
fiscal contraction.
I make no apology for having opposed a large fiscal contraction when the
recovery seemed modest and uncertain. But having decreed such contraction,
it would be absurd for the authorities to counteract it now by further
interest rate reductions, until the effects of the main direct tax increases
can be seen in the coming financial year.
A much more controversial assertion of Martin is that there is little, if
any, excess capacity so that the scope for high growth rates is small. He
also believes that despite the 1993 Budgets there is still a large
structural deficit and a potentially catastrophic balance of payments. He
advocates further large-scale tax increases or public spending cuts combined
with currency depreciation at favourable opportunities.
These matters are not merely uncertain, as he admits, but inherently
unknowable. So let me concentrate on the capacity point and the relevance to
it of the declining unemployment trend. This is shown both by the Department
of Employment's employer-based series and the new Labour Force Survey (LFS).
The unemployment rise registered in it in the middle of last year was almost
certainly a blip in the downward trend.
Because employment estimates lag well behind the unemployment claimants'
count, it is impossible to be sure what produced the fall in the latter.
Evidence in 1993 up to last summer suggests that there was a net increase in
jobs and not just a movement out of the labour force registered as available
for work.
Economic observers without political points to make have a special concern.
For it is unusual to have either a drop in unemployment or a rise in
employment so early in what is billed as a moderate upturn. David Walton of
Goldman Sachs suggests that half of the difference compared with the 1980s
represents a slower demographic growth of the labour force, leaving the
other half still to explain. The most favourable interpretation is that the
upturn is more vigorous than the official figures so far suggest. In that
case, and if it continued, the economy could stand some of Martin's further
fiscal tightening. The most unfavourable interpretation is that productivity
growth is already slowing down strongly.
The truth may be somewhere in between. The recovery is probably sharper than
realised. On the other hand, earlier productivity estimates were probably
inflated by an underestimate of the labour force, which has been picked up
by the LFS.
The rise in employment up to last summer is more than accounted for by the
increase in part-time jobs, most of which went to women. These jobs should
not be scoffed at as second-rate or ungenuine. Only 13 per cent of
respondents told the LFS that they took these jobs for lack of a full-time
one. But their spread does suggest that inflationary pressures in the labour
market are much less than the headline unemployment figures suggest.
Bottlenecks in the present upturn are indeed more likely to arise from the
capacity than the labour side. Unfortunately most studies of capacity relate
to manufacturing, which is less than a quarter of the total economy.
Capacity in the rest of the economy is much more elusive, as exchanges
between officials and the Treasury Committee bring out, and no one has even
really tried to measure it.
Taking both the exchange rate factors which I analysed last week and the
domestic ones, there is no case for either a loosening or tightening of
policy now. But both the stance and the mix could need to be changed as the
year goes on. Acting in time should not be confused with the sin of
fine-tuning.

<TEXT>
Sir, In your editorial, 'The case for lower rates' (January 13), you come
quite close to suggesting that short-term interest rates should be cut for
short-term political purposes.
Surely we have moved on from all that. My understanding is that short-term
rate changes are now decided predominately by the monetary authority - and a
good thing too. Those decisions should be de-politicised as much as
possible, although the break can never be complete.
Ultimately, as your editorial rightly concludes, the answer is greater bank
independence a la francaise.
In the meantime, I hope that the idea of adjusting interest rates in
response to political flows and eddies is buried, as it should have been
long ago.

THE GLOBAL MARKETPLACE: CAPITALISM AND ITS FUTURE By John Redwood
HarperCollins, Pounds 18, 243 pages
John Redwood is reputed to be one of the 'bastards' in John Major's cabinet
whom the prime minister cannot dismiss because he might cause more trouble
outside than in. Here is a Redwood manifesto, written just before he entered
the cabinet as Welsh secretary last year.
Save on one subject, which could yet be lethal, the evidence is that Mr
Major has nothing to fear. Indeed it seems unlikely that a prime minister
who makes cabinet changes so seldom, and none of them sweeping, could
deliberately introduce a new face with whom he would be at loggerheads on
all issues: otherwise, it would look like carelessness. One of the striking
facts to emerge from the book is how, on most subjects, Redwood, the fellow
of All Soul's, and Major, the leader without any academic qualifications,
think alike.
Ignore the slightly pretentious title, The Global MarketPlace, and the much
more pretentious subtitle, Capitalism and its Future. This is not a book
about economics, but a way of life. Global capitalism comes into it only in
the sense that modern communications and a free-ish trade system make it
possible to operate successfully without great concentrations of labour. In
another decade the theme would have been 'small is beautiful', though
perhaps with an over-arching international framework.
On social policy, Redwood observes the conventional pieties. 'Popular
capitalism' - incidentally the title of his previous book - 'believes that
there is a role for the state. The state should be able to guarantee a basic
standard of pension and national insurance protection to all.'
He thinks that the divide between left and right over public expenditure and
taxation has become less than is sometimes assumed. 'Rightwing parties
accept the role of taxation in redistributing income and in financing public
services for those in need . . . The debate is over degree and the correct
mix.' Denis Healey used to say much the same thing as chancellor in the
1970s.
The phrase 'back to basics' is used only once. Here again the prime minister
has no need to worry. Redwood applies it to education, not personal
morality. Even then, he is strikingly liberal. While he favours a tilt back
towards better 'teaching, testing and measurement of results', he is
sympathetic to allowing children to work 'in a relaxed atmosphere at their
own pace'.
There is also a more conservative side to his thinking. Redwood has no
interest in constitutional reform of any kind. He thinks that the British
parliamentary system in its present form works better than any other. He
believes that, while there should be more local government, any introduction
of regional government would be a threat to the centre and must therefore be
opposed.
On the current state of London, he observes: 'The government has established
a cabinet committee to take those decisions that need a London-wide view
(transport, planning and development are just three areas which require such
a perspective). The private forum on London will promote the metropolis as
an international centre for business, trade and inward investment.' And
that, he says, is enough: no more Ken Livingstones, no elected mayor, for in
London central government knows best.
Redwood is also curiously sympathetic to the Labour party. This is not
because of its policies, though he admits that those have evolved. It is
because he believes so firmly in a two-party system. The Labour party must
be kept going, and occasionally even elected, if only to avoid the chaos of
a hung parliament and coalitions. Such chaos, he suggests, is manifest all
over the European continent.
At times, the Redwood doctrine can sound harsh. 'In advanced western
societies,' he writes, 'there will never be enough people on income support,
enough people from ethnic minorities, enough homeless, to forge a winning
coalition from policies that try to deal with their specific interests. A
winning coalition requires the vote of many who go to work on time, who pay
their taxes, who save for their old age, who do not wish the state to be too
intrusive.'
In all these statements, there is no reason to believe that the thoughts of
John Redwood are much different from the thoughts of John Major. They are,
after all, both youngish Conservatives and members of the same cabinet.
Where they may be wrong is in turning their backs completely on
constitutional reform. How about a smaller parliament, for example? And it
may begin to look like foolishness to ignore the rise of the Liberal
Democrats in the south of the country. The party is scarcely even mentioned
in the course of the book.
Where Major and Redwood differ fundamentally, however, is on Europe.
Redwood's chapter on the European Community is sneering, dismissive and
arrogantly ignorant of the forces that brought the continental countries
together. 'The United Kingdom in the early 1970s,' he claims, 'thought it
was entering a kind of free trade arrangement.' Nobody who had read the
Treaty of Rome could conceivably have thought any such thing. Since then,
Redwood argues, the Community has consistently got in the way of British
interests.
There are elections to the European parliament in June. The Conservative
party will have to publish a manifesto. Cabinet ministers will have to
campaign to try to prevent a significant loss of Tory seats. The previous
European elections were the first serious setback at the polls suffered by
Margaret Thatcher. For the present prime minister, it could be worse. What
is John Redwood going to say in the campaign, and John Major too, come to
that?

FT  20 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Alarming view of past events
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ANDREW STUTTAFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In his article 'Return to the Family' (January 14) Simon Holberton
quotes Mr Tsang, chairman of a 'pro-Beijing' grouping within Hong Kong,
describing his first visit to China, an event that took place in 1965. 'It
was love at first sight. I talked to older people and to younger ones like
me. They were all inspired by some higher goals that were simply lacking in
Hong Kong.'
It is perhaps worth recalling that 1966 saw the beginning of the cultural
revolution. People may well have been inspired by Mao's contrived
fanaticism, but the most visible 'higher goals' were the persecution and
slaughter of imaginary 'class enemies'.
Mr Tsang's enthusiastic response might, perhaps, have been understandable in
an over-excited 19-year-old. The fact that, nearly 30 years later, he can,
without apparent remorse, recall and by implication even endorse those
feelings is repellent. Given that Mr Tsang may presumably achieve some power
in post-1997 Hong Kong, it is also highly alarming, at least for those who
may be unfortunate enough to live under him.

FT  20 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Why it is right to link trade policy
to labour standards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN MONKS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your editorial, 'Mr Clinton's trade agenda' (January 14), arguing that
it is wrong to link trade policy to the observance of minimum labour
standards, misses the point.
The Trades Union Congress has advocated a social clause in trade agreements
to tackle some of the worst abuses of workers' rights, including forced
labour and cruel exploitation of children. With other national trade union
confederations, in industrialised and developing countries alike, we want to
eliminate appalling situations such as those which prevail, for example, in
China, where in four separate factories in the last two months more than 220
workers have been killed in fires and explosions.
Where such abuses are linked to trade, it is reasonable to use trade
instruments to address them and we would not be asking anything more than
states have already committed themselves to through their membership of the
International Labour Organisation.
Your editorial is right to say that this would not eliminate the competitive
threat posed by cheap labour countries. But that is not the purpose. Rather,
it is aimed at encouraging a positive improvement of employment conditions
in the exporting countries. As a consequence, it would also help to
distribute the benefits of trade more fairly within the countries
themselves, ultimately benefiting their own growth and the expansion of
world trade generally.
If there is a danger that a social clause could become an excuse for
protectionism, as your editorial suggests, then it arises for each country
or group of countries acting on its own. The surest way of avoiding the
protectionist danger would be to reach agreement on a multilateral basis,
through the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade machinery which includes
the developing countries, rather than to ignore the problem altogether.

FT  20 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Warranty issue to be considered
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DERMOD HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your report headed 'OFT to probe sales of electrical warranties'
(January 18) is premature and therefore misleading.
The director-general of fair trading has been asked by government ministers
to consider whether the practice of some retailers of promoting their own
extended warranty schemes should be investigated as a breach of the
Restrictive Trade Practices Act. This was alleged in a recent parliamentary
question by Mr Nigel Griffiths MP.
The Office of Fair Trading is therefore considering the issue and the
director-general will reach a conclusion in due course. Your report that we
are making inquiries with a view to launching an investigation pre-empts the
actual position which is to determine whether or not an investigation is
necessary.

FT  20 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: A desirable reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN WYLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Why would it be 'unthinkable' for member states to compensate farmers
for price reductions from their own treasuries? Mr Terry Wynn MEP (Letters,
January 18) says such a move would be to 'renationalise' the Common
Agricultural Policy. On the contrary, it could be part of a highly desirable
reform whose other main element would be a steady reduction in EU farm
prices until they are in line with world prices.
The impact on some farmers - mainly those operating small, barely profitable
holdings - would be a social problem requiring social policies to be devised
by member states. Why on earth should the EU embrace Mr Wynn's idea of
one-off transferable bonds to compensate farmers when it would never dream
of such a benefit for any other victims of industrial restructuring?
The EU's social and environmental objectives for agriculture are no longer
being served by the CAP. If these were left to member governments,
subsidiarity would be made flesh and national democracies strengthened.
Responsibility for agricultural trade would remain with the Union, as would
the application of competition policy. The EU would become a good world
citizen, surpluses would disappear, environmental damage be much reduced, a
source of rows between member states eliminated and a major obstacle removed
to membership of the Union for central and eastern European countries.

MANHATTAN MURDER MYSTERY (PG) Woody Allen
HEAVEN AND EARTH (15) Oliver Stone
TOMBSTONE (15) George Pan Cosmatos
CALENDAR Atom Egoyan
HOUR OF THE PIG (15) Leslie Megahey
BHAJI ON THE BEACH (15) Gurinder Chadha
Manhattan Murder Mystery is Woody Allen's funniest film in years. Yet
watching it I kept thinking of the space shuttle disaster. For this comedy
is a kind of tragedy. A rocket falling travels through the same airspace as
a rocket climbing and at much the same speed. To the casual eye it might be
a replay of the same spectacle. Yet everything has changed.
The energy of hope is now the energy of panic or the nullity of despair. The
unity of purpose and construction is now a cluster of shellshocked
fragments.
In his new film Woody Allen plays a New York flat-dweller whose enigmatic
neighbour (Jerry Rubin, doing a portly-ominous number a la Raymond Burr in
Rear Window) may have murdered his wife. Woody is here rejoined - falling
through the old career airspace - by Diane Keaton as his sleuthing spouse
and by Marshall Brickman as his co-screenwriter. Together again] The trio
who made comedy history with Annie Hall]
Only this time the vehicle is a movie shuttle and it is going down not up.
As for the noise from us watchers on the ground - we who loved Woody when he
soared and have watched agonised as his name plummets through the Scandal
Zone - well, is that laughter or hysteria?
Probably bits of both. Here is the bug-eyed, mosquito-voiced Everymensch:
flailing his arms, railing at life, remembering his first ill-fated date
with his wife (they saw Last Year At Marienbad - 'Who knew they were
flashbacks]?') and aghast when her friendliness to the elderly Jewish couple
down the corridor turns into DIY detective work when the wife suddenly dies.
He groans as she gets up at midnight to break into locked apartments. He
urges her to start seeing her shrink again - 'You know how General Motors
recalls defective cars?' But he finally gives up and joins her, plus Alan
Alda (best friend) and Anjelica Huston (passing novelist), in tracking down
the evildoer.
The one-liners are beauties. Woody to Diane: 'Save a little craziness for
menopause]' Woody after Die Walkure at the Met: 'I can't listen to that much
Wagner. I start to get the urge to conquer Poland again.' Yet something is
wrong, and it is the same 'something' that a falling space vehicle might
sense. Deja vu. Captain, I think we have passed that cloud/sunbeam/bird
before.
Nothing in Manhattan Murder Mystery is new. The joke allusions to old movies
(The Lady From Shanghai; Double Indemnity); the phobic fun with high culture
(Huston's new novel 'makes Finnegan's Wake seem like airport reading'); the
comedy of paranoia (who will get caught behind the wrong door?). Above all,
the Woody dementia itself. He is still the endearing twit with the haymaking
gestures and vertical take-off intonations. But this time the antic
infantilism starts to look a bit ghoulish in a man we know to be nearing 60
and knocked about (offscreen) by things worse than being caught prying into
the life of a suspect uxoricide.
We do laugh, at times even guffaw. Yet we also sense a film of fragments
without moment: a scrapbook movie. It is as if the heat-seeking tabloids
have finally got to Spaceship Woody, or as if he has realised that they
might. He has shrugged his shoulders, taken the safety-catch off the
artistic auto-destruct button and prepared to head back for base, albeit in
a last warming glow of nostalgic glory.
Oliver Stone's Heaven And Earth, the last part of his Vietnam trilogy, has a
different way of setting the screen aglow. Some war movies move us by their
awful stoicism. The unsaid feelings of La Grande Illusion or Paths Of Glory
speak louder than words or images. Other war cinema, including Stone's
Platoon and the combat scenes in Born On The Fourth Of July, comes at us
high on sound and visual fury, like fire-breathing monsters.
Heaven And Earth takes two books of memoirs by Vietnam-born Le Ly Hayslip,
who suffered in the war at both VC and US hands, and uses them as kindling
matter for Stone's latest essay in agit-pyromania. We sense him setting
things up in the credits sequence. Wide-screen vistas of a verdant valley -
Southern Thailand playing Central Vietnam - are dunked in lush orchestral
music plus choirs, much as a pile of wood is soaked in paraffin by an
impatient bonfire-builder.
Softened up by this inspirationalism? Then bring on the juddering
angel-of-death helicopter, pixilating the landscape into an apocalyptic
blur. Follow that with dream sequences in which Le Ly visualises young
compatriots being hurled from Uncle Sam's choppers. Follow that with
capture, rape and torture-for-all-tastes (electricity, snakes down blouses,
ants on honey-smeared ankles). And then drag our heroine, after first
orphaning her from her wisdom-spouting father (Haing S. Ngor of The Killing
Fields), into the very engine-room of US imperialism by marrying her to
Sergeant Tommy Lee Jones.
With this actor, fast becoming America's leading psychotic, there is only
ever one question. When will he crack up? He cracks up here back in America,
after his shocked bride learns he plans to cash in his army stripes for an
arms-trading career back in - yes] - Vietnam. Stone films these domestic
corrida scenes with an intensity so fierce that they almost work. Jones's
gnarled bullet-head, harbouring all America's tragic geo-political evils,
creates a grand-guignol visual counterpoint with the melting, solicitous Le
Ly, better played than the role deserves (as scripted) by newcomer Hiep Thi
Le.
These scenes suggest that if Stone could abandon his preachy overview of
man's beastliness to man, he might find far more power - as any good artist
finally does - in splitting the atom of personal encounter. Great drama
grows in small spaces. Large spaces merely encourage gas-filled generality.
On that theme, which of the following transatlantic films should you go for?
The small Canadian film about identity, Atom Egoyan's Calendar? Or the large
Hollywood rehash of the OK Corral story, Tombstone?
No contest. Tombstone is two long hours in the Echo-chamber Elegiac mode, in
which a handlebar moustache called Wyatt Earp (Kurt Russell) muses on life
with dying Doc Holliday (Val Kilmer) overacting Powers Boothe (as Curly
Bill) and wheeled-in-for-a-cameo Charlton Heston. Sometimes guns are fired,
but more in sorrow than in anger. And director George Pan (Rambo) Cosmatos
directs as if his trigger finger is itching to shoot away all the phony
weltschmerz in Kevin Jarre's screenplay.
Calendar treats a terminal subject with teasing glee. The director of The
Adjustor here revisits his ancestral Armenia, commissioned to take photos
for a tourist calendar, and improvises a tale of marital break-up. Main
characters: himself (often just a poignantly interrogative voice off
camera), his Armenian-born wife and the local guide who becomes her lover.
While a foreign sun shines on their bilingual imbroglios, flash-forwards
depict Egoyan back in Canada trapped in the misery of serial dating and the
miasma of memory. This film about time, space and emotional paradox is as
bewitching and many-angled as its own leitmotif: the Byzantine churches that
gaze timelessly, tauntingly, from the skylines.
Finally, two British movies which sprawl amiably all over their subjects.
Leslie Megahey's The Hour Of The Pig takes a just-fancy-that historical
footnote - did you know that mediaeval French justice used to put animals on
trial? - and gets carried away by its possibilities. Magistrate Colin Firth
battles to save a black porker from a murder charge, while Nicol Williamson,
Donald Pleasence and Ian Holm snarl, oink and sharpen their trotters in the
background. A few moments of inspired battiness are not enough.
In Gurinder Chadha's Bhaji On The Beach, Anglo-Asian Birmingham has a
funny-disastrous day out in Blackpool. Four generations of immigrants find
their problems coming to a head, as pregnant daughters, wife-beating
husbands, lonely aunts and God knows who else find their trip turning into
an awayday to Purgatory. The comedy is too soft-centred to make the teeth
crunch on these themes as they should. But there is flavoursome charm in the
performances and the seedy-photogenic setting.

FT  20 JAN 94 / Arts: Unfinished Business - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD

<TEXT>
No-one can accuse the Royal Shakespeare Company of not being broad-minded.
The extraordinary new play at the Pit is overtly sympathetic to fascism, or
at least to fascists.
Nor are the characters poor Italians taken for a ride by Mussolini without
knowing any better. They are English fascists, in a stately home, and their
heroes are not Il Duce but the real thing: if not quite Hitler, certainly
Goering.
Michael Hastings's Unfinished Business is not about appeasement and the
Cliveden set, whose motives might have been more understandable. It is 1940;
the war has started and these are German supporters, not appeasers. Lord
Sheffield and family stand in their stately grounds to cheer the Luftwaffe
over England.
The Bishop of Devon has arrived with his hand grenades and a sub-machine gun
to help the German forces they are confident are about to arrive. Lady
Sheffield says firmly before dinner: 'Whatever happens, you can rest assured
that villains like Churchill and Beaverbrook will hang from Whitehall.' The
aim is to establish two empires, one German, one British, to stand up to
communism and semitism and preserve the Saxon race.
Moreover, the Sheffields, so far as the family survives, remain unrepentant.
For apart from 1940 Unfinished Business is also set in the present day. The
new Lord Sheffield, a tennis-playing schoolboy when the play began, is now
impoverished in an old people's home which happens to be the original
stately mansion. 'I lost the war,' he says, but 'I am a fascist. I haven't
gone away.'
All this is presented without satire or criticism. The Sheffield family is
played with sympathy, even dignity, with the old Lord Sheffield defending
'the Englishman's right to be ridiculous in his own country'. Nobody laughs.
When one recovers from the mild surprise of seeing a piece like this at the
RSC, or indeed anywhere, what is Unfinished Business like as a play? It is
certainly interesting. There are some elements of a plot, sometimes several.
There is a butler Douglas (Jasper Britton) whom Lord Sheffield claims to
believe is working for British intelligence. The suspicion drives the butler
mad, but when he produces a gun to threaten the entire Sheffield household,
it is the butler who is shot. Lord Sheffield hangs himself, abetted by his
son, who inherits the title.
The young Lord Sheffield dismisses the maid with whom we have seen him
romping in the attic. She is pregnant with his child. Such sudden dastardy
at least facilitates the move to the present day. In the old people's home,
Sheffield's nurse is the maid's daughter and the mother turns up to visit.
The last 20 minutes or so struck me as almost intolerably sentimental as the
old man seeks a reconciliation, though there is a final twist when one of
the old hand grenades is discovered and there is the possibility of a mutual
suicide pact.
Some of the performances are excellent. Philip Voss is always admirable. As
the old Lord Sheffield, he has a streak of bullying snobbery, but also
fierce pride and independence. When the butler pulls out the gun, the senior
Sheffield is the single member of the family to stand up to him.
The only really unpleasant figure in the play is the simpering Bishop played
by Ian Taylor. That seems a bit unfair, since they are nearly all in it
together, but Taylor can certainly drivel. Gemma Jones is an impressive
looking Lady Sheffield, yet has very little to do. The part of the new Lord
Sheffield is split between Toby Stephens playing the 17-year-old and
Geoffrey Bayldon as the septuagenarian. The part that stands out above all
is Britton's butler. All butlers, he says, tread a narrow path between
sanity and madness and in one scene he treads it perfectly. The same scene
shows that Hastings can certainly write, even if he has produced a strange
play. Direction is by Steven Pimlott.

FT  20 JAN 94 / Arts: One sail short of a full rig - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Daphne Du Maurier (1907-89) wrote three plays: the third, September Tide
opened in London in 1948 and is now at the Comedy Theatre in a joint
production with The King's Head, the Thorndike Theatre Leatherhead and the
Liverpool Playhouse. This brief Cornish sea tale is one sail short of a full
rig; but it is well acted and neatly paced.
Evan, a rumbustious Welsh artist of the Dylan Thomas variety, is
unromantically married to Cherry, a sulky, idle Chelsea art student. They
visit her mother, Stella, at her beach house in Cornwall; Evan falls in love
with his new mother-in-law, and the situation is further complicated by
Cherry's loutish brother and Stella's suave local suitor.
It is hard to tell whether this is a comedy: director Celia Bannermann's
problem is that Du Maurier's style is so open that any interpretation can
fit. The lines played as jokes pop up uninvited and unannounced: 'How do you
do, I'm mother,' says Stella to Evan, 'I've never had a son-in-law' and he
replies 'Perhaps I'll be the first of many.'
Du Maurier is at her best in stories which adapt well for the screen (Don't
Look Now, Jamaica Inn, The Birds) where her wonderful ability to create
atmosphere can be translated into images which have a vaguely menacing feel.
This show starts with a haunting tune from Eric Satie and ends with Stella
looking at the ferry which carries Evan away. In between there are
meaningful pauses over Evan's portrait of Stella and a warning about the
power of those September tides. In essence, this resembles Noel Coward's
Brief Encounter. One character declares love for another and the situation
becomes too too unbearable for both.
The acting carries the weakness of Du Maurier's plot. As the brawling Evan,
Michael Praed is superb: loose-limbed, quirky and passionate. His moods
shape every scene he plays. Opposite him, Susannah York as Stella is still
too distrait for a woman he would fall for; her best scene is alone on stage
waiting for him to tie up a boat during a storm, without speaking, she gets
across how worried she is that he might not return, and then hides her
concern from him when he does. Elsewhere, the cast seems less certain about
their difficult roles. Hermione Norris as Cherry is belligerent to a fault,
and Peter Byrne as Stella's suitor polite beyond belief.
Du Maurier originally called the play Mother, and based the central
character on Ellen Doubleday: it still bears the marks of that infatuation,
although Du Maurier protested that she was not a lesbian. What she has left
is a vacuum of a play filled by two good central roles.

Judging by last week's opening episode, Big Science is yet another attempt
to make science simple. The trouble is that ideas such as the Big Bang
theory aren't simple, and however slick your presentation, and sexy your
presenters, they are never going to become simple. Today, like every other
series, this one visits the US. Subjects include the Gaia theory and
neutrinos: where are they? (8.00 BBC2).
Minder, a survivor from the old days before franchise auctions spoiled
British commercial television, provides a rare oasis of high quality
entertainment in the desert of shoddiness that is ITV today. This week
brings the 100th episode. George Cole in the Arthur Daley role, without whom
everything would collapse, is involved with a friend who is fleeing a
murderer, and also with the Salvation Army (8.30).
Footage of a British wildcat hunting (not a feral cat but the real thing as
still found in the wilds of Scotland) is promised by Wildlife On One (8.30
BBC1). Great Railway Journeys travels across South Africa, visiting, among
other cities, Johannesburg (9.00 BBC2).

FT  20 JAN 94 / People: Cable and Wireless tempts second BP exec
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Cable and Wireless, the international telecommummunications group, has
poached another senior executive from British Petroleum.
Stephen Pettit, 42, chief executive of BP's petrochemicals business, has
been appointed to the newly created post of Cable and Wireless's managing
director for Europe.
Pettit is following in the footsteps of James Ross, a former managing
director of BP, who took over as Cable's chief executive in April 1992.
Like Ross, who had spent 33 years at BP, Pettit is a veteran BP man, having
joined the company in 1974 after university. In 1981, BP paid for him to get
his MBA from Insead.
Ross says Pettit has been hired for his 'extensive experience of
international management in a number of very competitive markets'. Prior to
taking on the petrochemicals job Pettit had been responsible for for BP's
oil trading business.
He will be responsible for Cable's activities in the European Union -
excluding the UK - together with Austria, Norway, Finland, Iceland, Sweden,
the Baltic states, Eastern Europe and the western CIS.
He will also be responsible for coordinating all Cable and Wireless mobile
activity around the world.
Pettit is to join the European management board, chaired by Mercury chief
executive Mike Harris, and will also join Ross's chief executive's
committee. Harris, former chief executive of Midland's Firstdirect telephone

FT  20 JAN 94 / People: Darjeeling man moves to Food From Britain
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Food From Britain, the government and industry funded body to promote
exports of British comestibles, has a new chief executive, Patrick Davis,
46. He gets his feet under the table, with a three-year contract, from March
7.
Davis, right, started his working life in the food business in 1964, joining
Cadbury as a management trainee. During his time with the company he served
in South Africa during 1969-70 and then moved on to Ireland, with a variety
of posts involved in sales, marketing and trading.
In the management buy-out of Premier Brands in 1986 he took over the
management of the tea division, and was closely involved with the company's
acquisition of six different tea companies in the following two-and-a-half
years. A previous chairman of the UK Tea Council - 'the champagne of teas is
Darjeeling', he says - Davis was managing director of Premier Teas, a major
division of Hillsdown Holdings, from 1990-93.
FFB was established in 1983 and now has six offices in Europe and one in the
US. Its overseas offices were recently privatised and last year provided
consultancy support to more than 700 British companies.
In September 1993 Derek Garner stood down as FFB chief executive, following
a government decision to slim down the organisation.
Davis says FFB will concentrate on two key aspects in the immediate future;
the export of British food products and the development of speciality
products in the UK. 'I'd like to put the 'great' back into great food from
Britain,' he says.

FT  20 JAN 94 / People: Bond trader settles deal
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Fears among top brass at investment banks in the City that their best bond
traders would jump ship once they received their hefty 1993 bonuses are
coming true - sooner than they thought.
With the ink barely dry on his handsome cheque, Michael Sherwood, the
28-year-old whizz kid widely seen as one of the driving forces behind
Goldman Sachs's rise to the top of the Eurobond league table, has traded in
his stressful life as head of the Eurobond syndicate desk at the US bank for
a more leisurely career as fund manager at a private Swiss bank in London.
Goldman's head of Eurobond trading, Sean Church, 29, has gone with him to
CBI-UBP International, the London subsidairy of Union Bancaire Privee.
Union Bancaire Privee was created in 1990 when Compagnie de Banque et
d'Investissements took over TDB American Express, the Geneva-based
subsidiary of the US financial services group.
'We received an attractive offer to develop a fund management business for a
major Swiss bank in a smaller working environment,' Sherwood said yesterday.
Michael de Picciotto, the head of Union Bancaire Privee in London, said the
duo will manage fixed-income investments for the bank's clients, and that
their appointments are part of the bank's expansion plans. They are expected
to be at their desks within one month.
Senior management at Goldman Sachs are stoical about the unexpected
departure of two of their most successful graduate recruits and point out
that staff turnover at their bank is lower than most. Dan Cook, the
30-year-old head of Eurobond syndicate at Union Bank of Switzerland, is
joining Lehman Brothers; further evidence that the Eurobond market's annual
game of musical chairs has started.

FT  20 JAN 94 / Technology: Buildings that take quakes in their stride -
Despite the scenes of destruction, Los Angeles could have fared much worse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Considering the forces involved, the density of population and the large
number of buildings in the area, Monday's earthquake in Los Angeles could
have been a lot more devastating.
This will not comfort those who lost loved ones or their homes or who were
seriously injured, but the death toll would have been much higher if more
buildings and structures had collapsed.
Richard Hough, who runs a 60-strong office for British consulting engineers
Ove Arup in Los Angeles, says: 'My first impression is that the city's
buildings came through it pretty well.'
There is serious concern at the collapse of some freeway bridges and
elevated motorway sections which would have been disastrous if this had
occurred during rush-hour. The damage has caused serious disruption to the
city's traffic but is still small compared with the size of the city's total
road network.
Ove Arup compares Monday's quake with a similar-sized one at Spitak in
Armenia in 1988 which killed 25,000 people and left a greater tide of damage
in its wake.
The US west coast has some of the most stringent building regulations in the
world outside Japan which suffers from an even more unstable geology.
International construction techniques to combat the severe stresses
unleashed by quakes have improved significantly during the last 25 years as
computers have allowed engineers to master the complex mathematics needed to
calculate how a building will respond to violent ground movements.
Demand to improve building standards in California rose sharply after a
hospital collapsed during the 1971 San Fernando quake which killed 65
people, says Edmund Booth, a senior seismic engineer at Ove Arup.
Structures must be pliable as well as strong, he says. If they are 'too
stiff' they will be unable to flex with the movement of the ground, and
collapse.
Designers, he says, must be careful that the natural frequency of a building
does not closely match that of possible ground movements. This could cause
the structure 'to hum like a tuning fork' and shake itself to bits.
This occurred during the 1985 Mexico City earthquake where an essentially
harmless earth movement was amplified by the soft soils of the dried-up lake
bed on which the city stands. This had a devasting effect on buildings of 12
to 20 storeys, says Booth.
The horizontal forces produced by quakes are substantial, yet buildings are
designed mainly to withstand vertical forces from the weight of floors,
furniture, people, office and industrial equipment they contain.
An office block in London, for example, might be designed to withstand a
horizontal force of of just 1 1/2 per cent of its vertical load to combat
high winds. In Los Angeles, this ratio might rise to 10-15 per cent and by
as much as 20-30 per cent in Tokyo.
A multi-storey building in Los Angeles carrying a vertical load of 25,000
tonnes, therefore, might be designed to withstand a horizontal force of
2,500 tonnes, which is quite a punch, says Ove Arup. Typically, the cross
section of a column supporting the frame of a Californian office block would
be up to 50 per cent larger than that of a building in a stable seismic
area. Reinforcement for columns also would be several times stronger.
Joints connecting upright columns and horizontal beams need to be strong to
prevent shearing, and sufficiently flexible to allow the building frame to
respond to ground movement.
A large number of deaths in the Armenian quake were caused by floors
breaking free from the frame and collapsing one on top of the other like a
pack of cards.
More recently, buildings have been mounted on bearings such as large rubber
pads designed to 'detune the structure from some of the underlying
earthquake movement'. Ove Arup estimates that about 10 buildings and a
similar number of bridges have been built this way in Los Angeles. 'It will
be interesting to see how these have performed compared with other designs,'
it says.
More recently, Japanese engineers have incorporated computer-controlled
hydraulic jacks which are used to brace buildings but can also allow the
frame to move depending upon the scale and frequency of the ground movement.
Designers also have to take into account the effect of building movement on
cladding and internal fittings. It is not enough to keep the building
standing and floors intact if large amounts of decorative cladding and glass
break free, killing and maiming crowds in the streets below.
Large pieces of equipment and furniture need to be fastened so that they do
not topple over and hurt staff. A telephone exchange at Erzincan in Turkey,
which wasthought to be fully prepared for a quake, suffered in 1992 when
batteries stored to provide emergency power spilt sulphuric acid on the
floor.
'The primary objective,' says Booth, 'is that a structure should be designed
so that its occupants can safely leave it even if some damage has occurred.'
Tragically this does not always happen.

FT  20 JAN 94 / Technology: Lucky numbers - A network for Britain's national
lottery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARAH UNDERWOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's new national lottery opens for business in about a year, promising
big cash prizes to the punters and much-needed tax revenues for the UK
government.
For the consortium chosen to operate the lottery, however, it also poses
some daunting technical problems, not least of which will be setting up one
of the largest computer networks in the world in around six months.
The eight consortia expected to bid for the licence next month agree that,
while the technology involved is relatively simple, the sheer size of the
network, coupled with strict requirements for reliability and security, will
make building the necessary computer system a tortuous task.
Having stated its requirement, the government is leaving the specification
of the system to its potential suppliers. To be truly national, however, it
will need to cover more than 10,000 nationwide retail outlets at launch
time, rising swiftly to approach 25,000. Each will be installed with a
specially designed terminal connected to a central computer system handling
on-line transaction processing at speeds of up to 2,000 to 3,000
transactions a second at peak betting times, typically the hour before the
weekly jackpot is drawn.
A second computer centre, located at a separate site in case the first is
hit by disaster, will be on constant standby, ready to take up the
processing load should the lead computer system fail.
David Bale, chief executive of the New Zealand Lotteries Commission and a
consultant to UK bidder the Great British Lottery Company, warns against
over-ambition. 'The key is integrity. The system must do everything
properly, all the time. I would suggest that it would be irresponsible for
anyone to bid newly developed software for such a large system as the UK. It
must be well and truly tested, as must the hardware and communications
network.'
New Zealand's lottery, set up under Bale's guidance in 1987, has 700 outlets
but because of their geographical spread and the country's demographics, it
has proved a tough testing ground. Newsagents were initially connected to a
central system via New Zealand Telecom leased lines and modems, although the
network was digitised last year to improve availability and resilience as
well as to add new features such as an emergency satellite back-up service.
Bale's worst memory is the Saturday morning when a road digger sliced
through both the primary and secondary wires connecting 50 per cent of New
Zealand's lottery customers to the central system, jeopardising an equal
percentage of the week's income. In this instance, service was resumed by
5pm in time for intense activity before the 7pm weekly big prize draw.
Besides leased lines and locally connected circuits, communications
technologies which may be viable in the UK include cable, packet radio
networks, emerging integrated services, digital networks and, ultimately,
the latest generation of satellite services.
Bale cautions, however, against a mix-and-match approach to building the
communications network. 'Every time you add a new media, you add problems. I
would avoid it like the plague.
'BT's twisted-pair wiring goes everywhere in the UK and I believe it will
deliver a very resilient service.' With the investment in technology to set
up the network expected to be Pounds 200m or more, British
Telecommunications will not be the only supplier keen for a slice of the
action, although its involvement is almost guaranteed as Mercury has neither
the coverage, nor the experience, sought by the consortia.
Established suppliers of lottery system hardware include US companies
Digital Equipment Corporation, Concurrent Computers and Control Data, which
also offers complete systems through its subsidiary Automatic Wagering
International. Software and specialist terminals are dominated by US-based
G-Tech, with more than 60 per cent of the world market. It is also a member
of the Camelot consortium (backed by Cadbury Schweppes), although this will
not preclude other bidders from selecting its systems.
Specially designed G-Tech lottery terminals, bearing some resemblance to a
hybrid automatic teller machine and cash register, and made by consortium
partner ICL (the UK-based and Japanese-owned computer company), would be
installed in retail outlets with communication handled across a customised
network of mixed media chosen for its cost effectiveness.
Don Stanford, G-Tech's senior vice-president for technology, says: 'We need
to achieve over 99.98 per cent availability and total transaction times of
less than 5 seconds from when the customer hits the button to when he
receives a receipt. And we want to give retailers a terminal designed to
provide the power, capacity and speed to sell all game products within 5
seconds. In the UK, things will go wrong if the solution is not completely
integrated or properly tested.
'The hardest part of the job will be planning and tackling the complexity
involved to have everything online on day one. Besides the computer systems,
retailers need to be trained and there will be a high field service
requirement.' Although none of the consortia is prepared to commit itself,
Stanford - who masterminded the Texas and California state lotteries -
believes more than 500 jobs in manufacturing, operating the lottery and
servicing retail sites will be created by the consortium chosen to run the
lottery under the first seven-year licence.
IBM, the technical partner in the Lottery Foundation (formed by Richard
Branson, chairman of Virgin), endorses the need for systems integration. In
its self-appointed role as a services company rather than hardware supplier,
the US computer group will act as a project management and implementation
specialist.
To enhance its technical credibility in the eyes of the government selection
team, Rainbow, the group put together by advertising agency Leo Burnett
under the chairmanship of Sir Patrick Sheehy (chairman of BAT Industries),
has enlisted a well-known technical expert. Peter Borer, formerly head of
British Rail's telecommunications arm, is, like his counterparts,
scrutinising all the technical options available.
As Bale points out: 'The UK lottery is the last big prize (in the gaming
sector) in the 20th century and probably the 21st. The battle will be in
marketing, but that must be supported by first-class gear.'

FT  20 JAN 94 / People: Virtuality's new strategist
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Virtuality, the recently-floated company which produces hardware and
software for virtual reality computer-generated entertainments, has turned
one of its non-executive directors - Anne Glover, on the board since
December 1991 - into chief operating officer.
Glover, right, will be based in the UK and will be responsible for
operations worldwide. She will focus largely on implementing the
international strategy of the company, which is aimed at making strong
advances in Japan, Asia-Pacific, and the US. Virtuality is focused on
exploiting the leisure possibilities of the new technology.
Glover, 39, is a Cambridge graduate and gained an MBA at Yale. She then
spent five years with Cummins Engine in the US, followed by a further five
years with the management consultants Bain, in Boston. In 1989 she joined
the venture capital company Apax Partners, which backed Virtuality in its
early days as W Industries. Peter Englander, a director of Apax, is to join
the board of Virtuality as a non-executive director.
The company was founded in 1988 by Jon Waldern, who remains its managing
director. Apax still has a 50.9 per cent stake in the company, though that
is expected to diminish gradually over the next few years. Virtuality
floated on the London Stock exchange in October; its shares immediately
traded at a substantial premium to the placing price of 170p, reaching a
high on the first day of 315p.

FT  20 JAN 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Monster challengefor
cut-price Kia / A look at a South Koreancarmaker's move into the US market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kia Motors, the South Korean carmaker, is about to launch itself on the US
market. It is a daunting challenge. No one knows the brand. It is about to
become the 36th nameplate in an already very overcrowded marketplace.
In order to carve a foothold in what is reckoned to be the world's most
competitive car market, Greg Warner, executive vice-president of Kia Motors
America, has decided that the key will be 'disruption'.
Early Kia market research was hardly encouraging, he says. 'No one knows us.
Kia brand cars have not been sold in the US before. No one needs us. It's
not news that there is an over-supply of vehicles on the market right now.
No one wants to hear from us. There's billions of dollars spent every year
on automotive advertising. Who the heck wants to hear from yet another car
company?'
The disruption strategy will effectively mean that Kia will seek to
under-price its rivals by a significant margin, while supplying cars of
competitive quality with often superior levels of standard equipment.
A similar strategy has often been used in the past by Japanese carmakers,
but now it is the Japanese competition itself that Kia has in its sights.
Warner maintains that a space has opened up at the bottom of the US market,
thanks to substantial price increases by the Japanese carmakers, who have
been under heavy pressure from the appreciation of the yen.
Kia's first US television advertising campaign begins next week, prior to
the launch in February. It features clips from a 1960s science fiction film,
Gorgo, with a gigantic monster trampling across the buildings of a city
centre to the accompaniment of screams and dramatic music. Then the text
appears, 'There's only one thing more frightening to Japan.' There's another
shot of the angry monster, then the text 'A well-built car for under Dollars
8,500' (Pounds 5,743).
Kia's first vehicle to be launched in the US is the Sephia, a small,
four-door, family car with a 1.6 litre, 16 valve Mazda-designed engine.
'Our greatest impact will be on Japanese makes,' says Warner, who is
targeting the Sephia at rivals such as the Toyota Corolla, the Honda Civic
and the Mazda Protege. It will also compete with GM's Saturn range and the
recently launched Chrysler Neon.
He claims that the lowest list prices for a four-door Corolla or Civic are
now more than Dollars 12,000. The Sephia is being launched with a base price
of Dollars 8,495.
'The concept of providing compact sedans for an affordable price has been
discarded by the Japanese. I have a feeling we haven't seen the last of
price increase announcements from the Japanese.'

FT  20 JAN 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): A brand new life
campaign - Allied Dunbar aims to become market-led with a new advertising
drive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the first time in nearly three years, Allied Dunbar, the top-league UK
life company, will tomorrow night have an advertisement on television. The
intention is that this will kick off a campaign that could be developed over
five, 10, or even 15 years. A Pounds 75m budget has been allocated for the
first five years' advertising - Pounds 10m of it will be spent in two bursts
this year.
This substantial commitment is the culmination of a complete reappraisal of
Allied Dunbar's position in the marketplace, its products, image and
marketing. The process of reform appears to borrow more from the world of
fast-moving consumer goods than from financial services. From seeing itself
as product-led in the 1970s, to distribution-dominated in the 1980s, the
company aims in the 1990s to become market-led. Along the way, it will want
to shake off the 'Allied Crowbar' tag it has earned as a result of its
robust sales methods.
Many of Allied Dunbar's concerns have been problems for the sector as a
whole. Recently the life industry has been defensive about a range of
issues, perhaps most notably the widespread failure to comply with
regulatory standards in the selling of personal pensions to people
transferring out of occupational schemes.
Nor has the industry's reputation been helped by its vigorous resistance to
regulators' determination that sale agents must volunteer to customers the
amount of commission they receive and more information about the products
they sell.
The latest divisions over the future regulatory system and the plans for a
personal investment authority are a further example of how life insurers
appear unable to take the initiative in improving how people may perceive
them.
The industry also faces severe changes as it deals with what is widely seen
as overcapacity within the sector. While Allied Dunbar believes that the
honeymoon period for bancassurance - the selling of insurance products
through banks or building societies - may be over, that is not a view taken
throughout the retail financial services sector.
In any event, it is a wise life company that makes efforts to raise its own
public profile when it is facing increasing pressure from competitors who
have a presence on most high streets.
Allied Dunbar is among the 10 largest life companies in the UK, with Pounds
14bn of funds under management and 1.4m clients. Most of its business, about
88 per cent, comes through its 4,000-strong direct sales force, while the
rest comes through independent financial advisers.
The company has existed as Allied Dunbar only since the mid-1980s. It was
originally set up as Hambro Life in the early 1970s by Sir Mark Weinberg,
under whose leadership it revolutionised life insurance sales techniques. He
departed in 1990 after it was bought by BAT industries.
The reappraisal began in the following year with the appointment of George
Greener, former head of Mars confectionery in the UK, as chief executive.
One of Greener's first actions was to freeze expensive television
advertising while the company sorted out its 'brand' - an approach and the
kind of language familiar to marketers of chocolate bars but a shock to
executives in the financial services world.
Greener has since moved on to a wider role in BAT but the current chief
executive, Sandy Leitch, who took over last year, has continued the review.
It was found that the company had a completely outdated picture of the
marketplace: it was using the industry's standard 'market segmentation'
model, linking life stages to financial needs but taking no account of
demographic changes.
The model - which has been around since the 1950s and is still used by some
of Allied Dunbar's competitors, according to Jerry Grayburn, marketing
director - assumes, for example, that all 20-39-year-old couples have young
children. Says Grayburn: 'If you haven't got children, you don't exist on
the old model.' Those over 60 and not retired, and single people with
dependent children, were other groups that were previously ignored. The
company has developed its own model which is already influencing product
design.
There are now seven new segments: young professionals; dual career families;
up-market empty nesters; mid-market empty nesters; new inheritors;
self-employed; and high net-worth individuals. Each of these has a number of
sub-segments.
The Grey Communications Group was hired to help Allied Dunbar define and
build its brand. The agency had little experience in financial services but
was known to Greener from his Mars days. Grey's first task was to find out
how the company was seen, both by employees and consumers. 'It was
confusion. We didn't know what our reputation was - it was different things
to different people,' says Grayburn. Some of the contradictory messages that
came back were that the company was both crusading and manipulative; was
simultaneously caring and aggressive.
The next problem was to establish what Allied Dunbar's brand - 'reputation',
rather than brand, has been the word more easily understood within the
organisation - ought to be. The result contains few surprises: consumers
want, for example, to know the company is large, successful and financially
secure; they want to be treated as individuals and have
individually-tailored solutions to their financial needs throughout their
life; and they want to find the company caring, honest, knowledgeable and
experienced. Interestingly, clients (customers are no more) also want
unpleasant and difficult issues confronted when investments, life assurance
and pensions are discussed, and to have a clear idea what provision is being
made for which eventualities, says Grayburn.
Consultants Coopers &amp; Lybrand are helping to develop indices that will
enable Allied Dunbar to measure the value of the brand and relate aspects of
its performance to the bottom line. It is hoped, for example, that it will
be possible to tell, over time, what the relationship is between client
satisfaction and profits, so that marketing can be more tightly focused.
The first television advertisement, unveiled tomorrow, will not focus on any
individual product, but will start to build the brand along the
newly-defined lines. Deliberately, no stars will be used, for fear of
overshadowing Allied Dunbar's own name. (The name itself will not change,
says Leitch: 'The only problem with the name is that it's not well-known
enough.')
As the television advertisements get under way, all the company's brochures
and publications will be overhauled. Until last year there was no unified
style, which caused confusion in the marketplace, robbing Allied Dunbar of
impact and leading to a 'horrendous waste of money,' says Grayburn, because
each publication needed individual design work. An interim redesign (see
illustration) will be superseded shortly.
Having set out its new, high-profile approach, Allied Dunbar is anxious to
do all it can to minimise the risk of its message being undermined by its
sales force, particularly given the background of public unease about
standards in the life insurance industry.
Increased spending on training and compliance, as well as changes to the
structure, have resulted, and specialist advisers have been appointed to the
19 regions to support the regional sales directors.
The remuneration of sales managers has also changed. Managers will no longer
receive a slice of commission on the products their sales agents sell, but
will be remunerated according to performance and targets set by the company.
Grayburn concludes in classic FMCG-style marketing speak: 'Delivering
consistent expectations is a key ingredient of building a strong brand. It
is also important to be differentiated from other brands. But, most
important of all, we've got to deliver. If you promise but don't deliver you
end up like British Rail.'

FT  20 JAN 94 / Accountancy Column: Commitment becomes the watchword of the
1990s - Bob Reynolds argues that the profession is encountering a big
turning point in its relations with clients
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BOB REYNOLDS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
During the mid 1980s, US corporate managers were driven by the cult of
excellence. But in the same period, much of the accountancy profession
remained rather slower to join the same battle cry.
A decade ago, the book In Search of Excellence by Tom Peters and Robert
Waterman became a bible for companies seeking to achieve perfect
performance. In the wake of the American experience, some forward-looking
corporate planners in the UK also wanted to learn from the quality and
excellence initiatives abroad to improve service to customers and enhance
internal operations.
Professional services organisations, despite offering quality management
consultancy to clients, came late to the notion that such programmes could
be applied to themselves. To a certain extent, they were victims of their
own professional mythology: that their performance was guaranteed by their
professional status.
Until the early 1980s, professional services firms in the UK cultivated a
mystical image depicting themselves as the guardians of largely inaccessible
knowledge. Their approach to the customer-supplier relationship was one akin
to medical specialist and patient. The commercial history of the last decade
has forced greater accountability on the professions and accountancy in
particular.
One of the principal themes which emerged from the research for my book
Excellence in Accountancy was the diversity of reaction among partners and
firms towards the emerging commercial dynamics of the last decade. In some
practices, there were partners and senior managers who could see the extra
demands that clients would soon make upon them as early as 1982 or 1983.
Their words of prophecy often fell on deaf ears.
These individuals were arguing not solely for a change in commercial
direction but a wholesale realignment of the professional dialogue with
clients. More traditional partners could not see the raison d'etre for
moving from the comfortable status which they had enjoyed for many years.
Nevertheless in the late 1980s the larger accountancy practices determined
that their independent survival depended on a reformed response to client
need.
In fairness to accountants, probably more than any other professional group,
the quality of their performance is contingent on the personal relationship
with client directors. Bankers speak enthusiastically about their personal
relationship with their customers, but in the end any manager is governed by
tight corporate lending policies.
In the accountancy sector, given the constraints of an international audit
approach, the partner in the modern practice has extensive scope for
fulfilling client expectations. The lead partner on a major international
assignment, either statutory or consultatory, will shape a team to meet
specific client demands. Although he or she will be accountable, in degrees
of formality, to fellow partners, the opportunity to provide the most
wide-ranging, creative but precise solutions for client problems is immense.
This places the greatest burdens on partners to add value to the client
relationships. The environment is aggressively competitive. One senior
partner told me: 'Ten years ago if you overheard company directors lamenting
their auditor on the 7.55 to Waterloo, you would probably ring him up and
say 'Watch out old chap'. Today you ring your own marketing department, they
contact the client service partner responsible for that target and he or she
rolls out an analysis of their worldwide operations, where you perceive
potential difficulties for them ahead and what solutions you propose. In
short, you use your competitor's difficulties to press home your advantage.'
The last five years have been characterised by widespread moves to reflect
changes in demands by clients and potential clients. Among these are: to
codify the responses of firms in terms of management structures which offer
greater scope for speedy decision-making; organised procedures for
marketing, research and product development; efficient structures for
bringing together the most talented people from international firms to
service multinational clients; systems for improving the quality of service
delivery in a broad portfolio of disciplines in key world markets; and, if
all these have some impact, improved targets for partnership profitability.
Not all these approaches have been entirely successful. However, the passage
of time has allowed the creation of such structures and benefits to flow
from them. Partners and therefore their firms are much more accountable for
the quality of their output. Fees are reviewed by clients more rigorously
today than a decade ago. Company directors, if not shareholders, appear to
be getting more out of relationships with their auditors.
If nothing else, firms have become more responsive to the changing demands
of the market. This has most recently been seen in the re-shaping of service
teams for audit assignments. Traditionally, an audit team would be led by
the partner whose daily involvement in the administration of the service
would be comparatively small. His or her role would be to oversee the
relationship with the client and to plan, broadly, the execution of the
assignment.
The bulk of the work was traditionally handled by the junior managers and
swathes of students who processed much of the number crunching. Clients are
now demanding that partners and senior managers give much more fully of
their own time, that they are buying more than overseeing capacity.
Directors of client companies want to use partner expertise as part of the
daily commitment to the delivery of the audit and other services. They also
want to take advantage of the intimate knowledge which firms have built up
of their business.
This has significant ramifications for the development of such practices.
Firms will in future require lower graduate recruitment. The larger firms
have been hiring between 500 and 1,000 students a year and were the largest
professional employers outside the Civil Service.
In future the firms will require fewer but higher calibre staff to work on
assignments. The emphasis will shift from students who take three years
before they are given real client responsibility to more senior people
engaged to work immediately or within a short time. There will be more
recruitment of partners and senior staff from non-accountancy based
practices.
Another trend has also been unfolding in the international arena:
multinational companies are requiring their auditors and consultants to make
larger scale commitments to their clients. The engagement procedure of
assessing potential suppliers can take much longer than the normal audit
beauty parade.
The reward for this closer commitment is the assurance that the company will
probably remain as a client and extend the use of supplier services. The
process involves supplier firms sharing the clients' approaches to quality
management, demonstrating extensive understanding of the client's
international objectives, basing key personnel permanently at the client and
responding rapidly to client demands.
Firms have moved in scope, flexibility and approach in the last 10 years.
The next decade will see greater demands on them to develop creative ideas
for international business, to ally themselves more directly with client
management approaches, and to become tougher but more fluid organisations
ready to respond to client needs.

FT  20 JAN 94 / Legal oddities in line for abolition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the strongest arguments for the government's drive against red tape
is the sheer oddity of some of the regulations being abolished.
For example, methylated spirits cannot be sold between 10pm on Saturday and
8am on Monday. Meths drinking, the Department of Trade and Industry says, is
a thing of the past, so legislation enacted 105 years ago can be repealed.
Scottish hairdressers are not allowed to open on Sunday. English haircuts on
the Sabbath are apparently legal.
Shops need a specific licence for selling kettle de-scaler. It is classed as
a poison.
The two government establishments which test gun barrels, in London and
Birmingham, have to ask permission from ministers if they want to raise
their prices. Since they are required to be non-profit making, the DTI
evidently thinks Mr Heseltine has better things to do.
Women in Scotland are not allowed to work in slaughterhouses. English women
are apparently more robust.
But some curious regulations which Lord Sainsbury's task force wanted
abolished are apparently to stay. Tobacconists must still display a warning
about health risks measuring not less than A3 size (it used to be A4). And
the law which states that betting offices are not allowed to have fruit
machines will probably stay, says the Home Office.

FT  20 JAN 94 / Contracting-out curbs will go
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Obstacles to contracting out public services in central and local government
will be swept away as part of the de-regulation bill.
Ministers, civil servants and local authority officers will be able to pass
their legal responsibilities on to contractors. They will also be able to
hand over confidential information to contractors, who would be bound to
maintain confidentiality.
At present many public functions cannot be passed on to private-sector
contractors - including the payment of civil service pensions.
The de-regulation bill will allow a wide range of functions to be fully
contracted out, including company registration, local tax collection, the
registration of patents and the collection of business statistics.
The bill includes a new power for ministers to remove obstacles to
contracting-out, subject to a parliamentary vote to confirm their removal.
This procedure could not be used for functions that affect the liberty of
the individual or that involve entry, search and seizure powers.

FT  20 JAN 94 / London truck ban to be simplified
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Measures to simplify a ban on trucks using many London roads at night and at
weekends were announced yesterday as part of the de-regulation initiative.
The Department of Transport also announced plans to replace the nationwide
system of bus and lorry operators' licences, which have a maximum life of
five years, with continuous licences.
Mr Steven Norris, transport minister responsible for London, said the permit
system in the capital would be abolished but heavy trucks would still have
to keep to main roads.
Abolition of permits, required by trucks which need to leave approved main
routes, will save road hauliers Pounds 3m a year. Restrictions on trucks of
16.5 tonnes and more using London's roads were introduced in January 1986 by
the Greater London Council.
The move from five-year vehicle operator licences to continuous licensing
will save businesses about Pounds 2.6m. Quality criteria will not be
changed, however, and periodic reviews of operators will still be made.

FT  20 JAN 94 / Car-boot sale move 'a crooks' charter'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Government plans to remove restrictions on organisers of markets, fairs and
car-boot sales could cost millions of pounds and push up council tax bills,
according to the Labour-controlled Association of Metropolitan Authorities,
John Willman and David Owen write.
They could also amount to a 'crooks' charter', according to the Labour
party, making it harder to restrict car-boot sales.
'It is now widely recognised that a lot of burglars use car-boot sales as a
means of reselling what they steal,' said Mr Doug Henderson, shadow local
government minister.
Currently, local authorities which run franchise markets or fairs can stop
competitors holding events within a radius of 6 2/3 miles of their own
market. The de-regulation bill includes clauses to abolish these common-law
market franchise rights, which produce Pounds 110m a year in gross rental
for local authorities.

FT  20 JAN 94 / Later openings likely for shops
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shops will, in theory, be allowed to stay open around the clock if the
de-regulation bill becomes law. There was no sign yesterday, however, that
retailers were preparing to introduce 24-hour shopping.
Most shops are supposed to close at 8pm on weekdays, apart from one night
when they are allowed to stay open until 9pm. Clause 17 of the bill would
allow shopkeepers to stay open as long as they liked.
The bill would do away with local anomalies on early-closing days. Shops
would be free to decide whether they closed, rather than being subjected to
local-authority requirements.
The provisions are separate from a bill on partial de-regulation of Sunday
trading likely to be passed later this year.
Asda, the retail chain, welcomed the weekday de-regulation move and said:
'We think that as retailers we should be free to open whenever our customers
want to shop.' It did not anticipate making significant changes to trading
hours, but some stores, particularly in metropolitan areas, might stay open
more often until 9pm.
Asda added that there was no evidence of demand for 24-hour trading in the
UK.
Marks and Spencer said it opposed Sunday trading, but favoured de-regulation
of weekday opening. It envisaged some later opening for edge-of-town stores
for after-work shopping.
Sainsbury said it had no plans to open any of its stores around the clock.
John Lewis said the final shape of the Sunday trading bill would affect its
decision on weekday hours.
Mr Pat Jones, national spokesman for Usdaw, the shopworkers' union, feared
pressure would be put on retailing employees to work round the clock. He
said: 'It would be getting back to the pre-war position, when it was common
for shopkeepers to go outside and see if their competitors had closed before
they decided to close themselves.'

FT  20 JAN 94 / Building society law up for review: Treasury to examine
rules on mergers, takeovers and changes of status
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A full review of the Building Societies Act, which sets out the regulatory
regime for societies, is to be undertaken by the government as part of the
de-regulation initiative.
The Treasury is expected to announce today that, together with the Building
Societies Commission, the sector's statutory regulator, it is to look again
at the provisions which have governed the activities of societies since
1986. The Building Societies Association will also be involved.
Areas which will be open for discussion will include the present limit of 40
per cent on funds which societies can raise on the wholesale markets, and
the merger and takeover procedures for societies. The process for societies
which change their status, as Abbey National did, will also be reviewed.
Some of the larger societies want greater access to wholesale funds, where
borrowing is cheaper, so that they can offer more attractive deals to
potential borrowers. Competition in this area is intense, and societies have
been losing market share to the banks.
'The financial services sector has changed considerably since the building
societies legislation was passed seven years ago,' one industry expert said,
'and the regulation ought to reflect that.'
The first tranche of the review is expected to end by early summer. The
govern-ment hopes to complete the process by the end of this year, perhaps
after further consultation in the autumn.
On this timescale, the conclusions would be ready soon after the time by
which the de-regulation bill should have become law. They could thus be
early candidates for the use of the new powers in the bill, which enable
ministers to amend primary legislation through orders.
The wider review complements the more technical changes affecting building
societies which are included in the de-regulation bill as well as in the
conclusions of the task force which advised the Department of Trade and
Industry on de-regulation in the financial services sector.
The de-regulation bill itself contains two new powers for societies.
First, they would be able to lend to a borrower against land held by a third
party. This would mean, for example, that when a borrower has negative
equity in his or her own house, a society could, for example, use the
borrower's parents' house as additional security.
Second, they would be allowed to take a direct part in syndicated lending,
with the removal of the existing restriction that means they can do so only
through subsidiary 'lending societies' prescribed by the regulator.
Other measures which are likely to follow include a streamlining of the
procedures determining how societies notify and consult their millions of
members about their activities.
Another technical change - in the way in which societies' permanent
interest-bearing shares and subordinate debt are classified - would give a
limited amount of greater flexibility in terms of the societies' wholesale
funding limits, even without any change in the overall limit.

FT  20 JAN 94 / MPs attack powers given to ministers: De-regulation bill
will make it easier to repeal laws - Employers will be able to 'override
agreements' on job shedding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MPs yesterday hit out at the powers the bill will give ministers to repeal
regulatory measures without primary legislation. They also questioned
parliament's ability to subject the government's actions to adequate
scrutiny.
Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, said Labour would resist
the government's attempt to take the power to overturn acts of parliament by
order of ministers.
'These laws were passed . . . to improve safety at work and to give the
consumer a fair deal,' he said. 'They should not be torn up without the same
full parliamentary process.'
Mr Nigel Griffiths, Labour's consumer spokesman, said the bill gave
ministers 'staggering' powers to 'axe' legislation and bypass the floor of
the House of Commons.
Mr Malcolm Bruce, Liberal Democrat trade and industry spokesman, said
parliament's role would be 'drastically reduced'.
Mr Bob Cryer, Labour chairman of the Commons statutory instruments
committee, said it was 'a bit rich' for the government to say it was
removing regulations by giving ministers' powers to make more.
The scrutiny of delegated powers was 'not adequate in parliament at the
moment', Mr Cryer said, predicting that the bill would make matters worse by
adding to the 'tidal wave' of regulations the government was producing.
Under scrutiny procedures set down in the bill ministers would have a duty
to consult those likely to be affected by a proposal before making an order
to put it into effect.
They would then be required to lay a draft order before parliament, with an
explanatory document setting out the reasons for the measure and other
details.
Forty days would have to elapse before the final order was submitted for
debate and approval in both houses of parliament.
Pressure on parliamentary time is such that it is usual for orders and
statutory instruments to be debated in the obscurity of a Westminster
committee-room rather than the main debating chamber. It is also common
practice for them subsequently to be nodded through rather than going to a
formal vote.
But mechanisms do exist for MPs to force both a debate on the floor of the
House and a formal vote where the issue is deemed serious or controversial
enough to warrant it. Once submitted, however, orders cannot be amended in
the way that bills can be.
According to the government the interim 40 days would provide an opportunity
for additional parliamentary scrutiny. It suggested yesterday that this
might be undertaken by new scrutiny committees, with powers to question
witnesses, in both the Commons and the Lords.
Under the government's suggestion it would be 'appropriate' for these
committees to be able to recommend either that a proposal should not proceed
in the way intended or that it should go ahead only if amended.
Ministers acknowledge that the final decision on what form parliamentary
scrutiny should take rests with the cross-party procedure committee.
Sir Peter Emery, the Conservative MP who chairs the committee, said
yesterday it would start considering the matter next week.
The bill states that ministers should 'have regard to' any representations
made during the period for parliamentary consideration.

FT  20 JAN 94 / Small businesses greet red tape moves with muted applause
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's de-regulation bill was yesterday greeted with muted
applause by small-business groups which say the smallest companies spend a
disproportionate amount of time fighting red tape.
While welcoming the initiative, small-business lobby groups said it was
essential that the government followed through with a determined effort to
sweep away the red tape produced by centuries of legislation.
Businessmen and women were particularly pleased with the so-called small
business litmus test which would be applied by all departments when
introducing new legislation.
The departments would assess the costs of complying with new legislation by
consulting two or three typical small companies.
The DTI said it would adopt a 'think small' principle which meant new
regulations would be framed with small businesses in mind.
New legislation would be tested for its impact on small companies'
competitiveness and their ability to export, the cost of implementation and
practicality.
The CBI said the government was introducing a fundamental change in culture
and attitude. Officials should no longer see themselves as regulators but
de-regulators.
The Institute of Directors called the legislation 'a powerful antidote to
unnecessary and obstructive regulation'. Mr Peter Morgan, director- general
of the IOD, said: 'Until now it has been too easy for government to
introduce new laws and too difficult to get rid of them.
'Government and parliament will now have the the power to remove a noose
from the necks of business - they should use it.'
The IOD said the UK's high regulatory burden put British companies at a
disadvantage with competitors operating under more flexible regulatory
regimes.
The Forum of Private Business, which has 21,000 members, gave a cautious
welcome to the bill. Mr Stan Mendham, the forum's chief executive, said:
'Sadly we have seen many false starts on regulation.'
The success of the initiative depended on the government following through
its good intentions and resisting new legislation from the EU. 'To
understand the law, business owners need to read over 400,000 words and
complying with red tape costs 3 per cent of turnover,' said Mr Mendham. The
attack on red tape was 'too important for the economy to be allowed to
fail'.
The forum said its research showed a quarter of companies spent between five
and 10 hours a week complying with red tape.
Citing particularly absurd regulations, the British Chambers of Commerce
said it took five separate pieces of permission to set up a whelk stall. And
one EU directive included guidelines for the maximum permitted length and
curvature of cucumbers.

FT  20 JAN 94 / Barclays to pre-notify customers over charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor and RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Barclays Bank announced yesterday that it intends to introduce
pre-notification of charges on personal customers' accounts, a service all
banks are likely to be required to implement under a revised voluntary code
of practice.
The bank said no date had been set for introducing the service, which it
estimated would cost Pounds 12m a year. The service is already provided by
banks including National Westminster, and Lloyds has said it will be
introduced this year.
Pre-notification of charges is one of the likely changes to the code, which
is due to be revised from March. Changes are being drafted by a joint
working party of three groups representing banks and building societies.
The working party received recommendations from a review committee headed by
Sir George Blunden, former deputy governor of the Bank of England. But it is
thought to have decided independently to require pre-notification.
The working party - of the British Bankers Association, the Association of
Payment Clearing Services and the Building Societies Association - intends
to publish a draft of the code next month.
Although Barclays has publicly argued that it does not think most customers
want pre-notification of charges, the service was recommended in several
submissions to Sir George's committee from consumer groups and others.
The banks introduced the voluntary code in March 1992 after consumer
pressure over the quality of service. Barclays bank staff unions are
planning to ballot members on proposals for a one-day strike against job
cuts, Richard Donkin writes.
The strike, proposed for February or March, has been discussed between the
Barclays Group Staff Union and Bifu, the banking and insurance union.
Barclays announced last week it had increased its five-year job-cutting
programme by 3,000 to 21,000 over the next two years.

FT  20 JAN 94 / Number of references to MMC may drop
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Merging companies are to be allowed to offer a wider range of undertakings
to the director-general of fair trading in an attempt to cut the number of
mergers referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
The proposal, outlined in the de-regulation bill yesterday, was one of the
measures designed to cut out unnecessary overlap in the roles of the Office
of Fair Trading and the MMC and to reduce the period of uncertainty for
companies caught up in competition investigations.
Instead of referring the merger to the MMC, ministers can now accept
undertakings from merging companies to dispose of parts of their business.
The bill would allow ministers to accept a wider range of undertakings, for
example on regulating the prices of certain goods of the merged business.
The government also proposes to allow companies to give undertakings as an
alternative to a monopoly reference to the MMC.
The OFT and other regulators are also to be allowed to accept undertakings
or ask the MMC to investigate an anti-competitive act under the 1980
Competition Act without carrying out a formal preliminary inquiry.
Lawyers said the measures should result in a change of culture at the OFT
and lead it into a dialogue with companies.
The bill also contains measures to reduce the burden on small businesses by
cutting the range of restrictive trade agreements which have to be notified
to the OFT. In a separate development yesterday the government announced
that from February 9 it was to raise the assets threshold above which
mergers qualify for review from Pounds 30m to Pounds 70m.

FT  20 JAN 94 / Brewers welcome licensing change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's decision to amend the liquor licensing law to allow
children under 14, accompanied by an adult, into pub bars in england and
wales was widely welcomed by brewers and pub operators.
The move will bring the law in england and wales - which at present
restricts children to pub dining areas or family rooms - into line with
changes introduced in scotland two years ago.
Under the bill's provisions licensing justices would be able to grant a
children's certificate to any licensee provided they were satisfied that the
bar concerned was a suitable environment and that meals and non-alcoholic
drinks would be available.
The brewers' society said: 'we believe many people are keen to see at least
some pubs granted children's certificates. About one in six pubs in scotland
now caters for children.
'We are concerned, however, that certificates should be granted in a
consistent way throughout the country, and that the licensing authorities do
not make unreasonable demands on licensees who apply for them.'
The campaign for real ale strongly supported the move. with the consumers'
association, it expressed disappointment that the bill did not provide a
clear statutory basis for pub licensing in general instead of allowing
magistrates unfettered discretion.

FT  20 JAN 94 / TUC condemns plans for redundancy selection
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An unexpected provision in the government's de-regulation bill that will
allow companies to select employees for redundancy even if it contravenes
'customary arrangements' or 'agreed procedures' was condemned last night by
the trades union congress.
The proposed change in the law will end the hallowed industrial relations
principle of 'last in, first out'.
Mr Brendan Barber, the TUC's deputy general secretary, said: 'plans to make
it possible for employers to override agreements and to select who they wish
for redundancy is just another kick in the teeth for good industrial
relations.'
At present under the employment protection (consolidation act) 1978 any
employer who selects workers for redundancy could face a charge of 'unfair
dismissal' before an industrial tribunal. the government believes the
existing law is 'unnecessarily restrictive' and believes 'employers ought to
have flexibility to adapt to current circumstances'.
The government argues: 'employees' interests would still be protected
because in the event of a claim of unfair dismissal an industrial tribunal
would consider whether an employer had acted fairly in the circumstances.'
'The government's proposal
The bill will also enable the repeal of outdated health and safety
legislation subject to consultation with the health and safety commission.
A report on the benefits and costs of health and safety regulations by the
commission will be submitted to mr david hunt, the employment secretary, in
april.
Mr Frank Davies, the commission's chairman, said yesterday: 'I cannot
conceive the commission will recommend anything which will lower health and
safety standards overall nor could I believe the government would accept it
if we did.'
The bill also proposes that employment agencies will no longer have to be
licensed before starting up.

FT  20 JAN 94 / Increased home sales fail to spur prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Demand from home buyers increased last month but the rise in sales has not
brought a corresponding rise in prices, a survey of more than 100 estate
agents reported yesterday.
The study, by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, says that 90 per
cent of agents in England and Wales saw no increase in prices in the last
three months of last year compared with the previous three months.
Just under 5 per cent per cent said prices had continued to fall while a
similar proportion reported increases of 2 per cent over the period.
The institution says prices have remained flat in spite of an increase in
house viewings and inquiries from potential purchasers. Sellers still need
to set a realistic asking price to secure a sale.
Confidence among potential buyers has grown as house prices have stabilised
and unemployment figures have improved. The 'upbeat mood' is most marked in
the south.
The institution expects the improvement in sales to continue but warns that
the recovery in prices will be slower.
It said: 'The number of transactions will have to increase before there will
be any meaningful impact on prices, which will rise only slowly throughout
the year.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Average salaries of secretarial and clerical staff in the private sector
have increased in real terms since 1992, says a survey by Alfred Marks, the
employment bureau.
Salary increases averaged nearly 7 per cent - about twice the average rate
of private sector pay increases - in the year to November 1993.
In London, salaries of personal assistants in the City fell 10 per cent over
the 12 months, bringing the average wage down to Pounds 15,500. In the West
End salaries of PAs remained static at an average of Pounds 15,500.
City secretaries saw an increase in real terms of 4 per cent, bringing the
average to Pounds 14,400 compared with a fall of 1 per cent for secretaries
in the West End. The west Midlands was the best-performing region in 1993
with salary increases of 6 per cent for PAs and 5 per cent for secretaries.
Alfred Marks said differentials between secretaries in London and elsewhere
had been eroded.

FT  20 JAN 94 / Property industry raises Pounds 5.7bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK commercial property industry raised Pounds 5.74bn in loans, bonds and
rights issues in 1993, Vanessa Houlder writes. It was the largest total
since 1989 and an 88 per cent increase on the previous year.
The statistics, which were compiled by Savills, chartered surveyors, reflect
a change in perception about the prospects for commercial property.
Expectations about the performance of property increased sharply as a result
of the improved prospects for the economy and the decline in interest rates
and bond yields.
The total raised included Pounds 2.65bn from loans, Pounds 710m from bonds
and Pounds 2.39bn from rights issues compared with Pounds 2.77bn from loans
and Pounds 281m from bonds in 1992.
The large increase in rights issues, which made a minimal contribution to
the total raised in 1992, reflected a re-rating of property company shares.
The level of funds raised through loans in 1993, which included a Pounds
1.1bn loan in October to allow Canary Wharf to exit from administration, was
similar to the 1992 total. Of the debt of Pounds 3.36bn, Pounds 2.18bn was
used for refinancing existing debt, leaving Pounds 1.18bn as new money into
property.
The statistics do not include the money invested directly into the market by
institutional investors, which also increased sharply last year.

FT  20 JAN 94 / Tobacco boost for PSBR
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The public sector borrowing requirement in December was Pounds 2.1bn, a much
lower figure than the Pounds 5bn that analysts expected.
One-off factors seem to have accounted for much of the discrepancy, however,
and the Treasury has not reduced its Pounds 49.8bn deficit forecast for the
1993-94 financial year.
Excise receipts from tobacco sales were Pounds 1.3bn higher than in December
1992 as wholesalers stocked up on cigarettes before the November 30 Budget,
which increased tobacco duties.
While the sales were recorded in November, the revenue only flowed through
to the government in December.
This surge translates into 900m packets of 20 cigarettes, or about 16
packets for every adult and child in the country.
The central government deficit was Pounds 3bn in December, up from Pounds
2.6bn in December 1992, but was offset by debt repayments by local
authorities and public corporations.
Local authorities repaid Pounds 500m of debt, the first time they had made a
December debt repayment since 1982. The Treasury and Central Statistical
Office indicated the repayment may be related to the temporary change in the
rules for capital receipts made by the former chancellor, Mr Norman Lamont,
in his 1992 autumn statement.
The temporary rules allow local authorities to spend the 1993 receipts from
the proceeds of the sale of council houses and other items. It appears that
many authorities have had higher 1993 receipts as a result of the policy.
The local authorities do not have to spend the money immediately, however.
Public corporations also repaid Pounds 400m of debt in December, compared
with a Pounds 100m increase in debt in the same month in 1992.
Total cash outlays were Pounds 22.3bn in December and Pounds 188.8bn for the
first nine months of the 1993-94 financial year, compared with Pounds
179.8bn in the same period of 1992-93. The running total for the PSBR in the
current financial year is Pounds 32bn, compared with Pounds 25.3bn for the
same period in 1992-93.

FT  20 JAN 94 / Retail activity was subdued over Christmas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A disappointing rise in Christmas retail sales, revealed in official figures
yesterday, indicated that consumer activity was more subdued than anecdotal
evidence from stores and shops suggests.
Last month the volume of sales fell a seasonally adjusted 0.2 per cent
compared with November, although it was 4 per cent higher than in December
1992. The year-on-year rate disappointed expectations for a 5.2 per cent
increase, particularly since sales in the previous Christmas period were
poor. Nonetheless, this was the biggest rise since July last year.
The news from the Central Statistical Office of the monthly fall in sales
came as a surprise following a report earlier this week from the
Confederation of British Industry, which painted a more upbeat picture of
the Christmas trading period.
Statisticians pointed out, however, that the CBI gave only the year-on-year
increase in sales, and that its figures were similar to the official series
on a month-on-month basis.
Anecdotal evidence of booming Christmas sales has further muddied the
picture, but this has come from the large chain stores which account for
two-thirds of retail sales. They are more easily able to hold down prices
and are therefore faring much better than smaller shops.
The most up-to-date figures confirm that on a year-on-year basis big
retailers are significantly outperforming small ones. The volume of sales by
small businesses in November fell 0.2 per cent compared with a year ago
while large retailers increased their sales by 5.8 per cent in the same
period.
The latest dip in retail sales may prompt unease in the government that
consumer spending will weaken significantly when Budget tax increases come
into effect in the spring. Viewed over three months, however, there is a
clear upward trend in volume of sales growth.
In the three months to December sales volume was 0.7 per cent higher then in
the previous three months, and 3.7 per cent up on the same period a year
earlier. Based on non-seasonally adjusted data, the average weekly value of
retail sales last month was Pounds 3.7bn, 5.9 per cent higher than in
December 1992.
The strongest growth in the latest three months has been in sales by mixed
businesses, a category that includes department stores. Sales volume was up
1.6 per cent in the three months to December compared with the previous
three months.
For food retailers and specialist non-food retailers the rises were 1 per
cent and 0.1 per cent respectively.
Figures released by CSO also show that sales volume was 3.6 per cent higher
last year than in 1992. This was the biggest increase since 1988 when the
increase, compared with 1987 was 6.2 per cent.
Consumers bought Pounds 5.4bn worth of goods and services using credit and
debit cards in December, according to the Credit Card Research Group, funded
by the credit card industry, Alison Smith writes.
Debit card spending was much higher at food and drinks retailers than credit
card spending, while the positions were reversed at gift stores.

FT  20 JAN 94 / BAe to shed 500 more jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Aerospace yesterday unveiled plans for further job cuts involving
about 500 staff in its missile division, more than a tenth of its remaining
workforce in the sector.
The cuts, likely to involve compulsory redundancies, follow a reduction of
830 jobs at three civil aircraft plants announced last week.
The company's Dynamics guided-weapon division, which is due to be merged
with the missile-making activities of France's Matra group, will be reduced
to 4,040 employees, less than a quarter of the level at the end of the
1980s.
BAe blamed the cuts on deferment or cancellation of orders.
The main reduction affects 330 jobs at BAe's main missile manufacturing
operation at Lostock, near Bolton. Another 160 jobs will go at Stevenage in
Hertfordshire and 20 at Bristol.
The company said the cuts were not related to the merger talks with Matra.
Southampton warship builder Vosper Thornycroft announced yesterday it was
recruiting 60 employees, mainly steelworkers.

FT  20 JAN 94 / Pay freeze Bill may be tougher than expected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's proposed freeze on the pay bill for 4.5m public-sector
employees could be tougher than expected judging by details uncovered in the
Commons Treasury and civil service committee's report on the Budget, David
Goodhart writes.
Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, made clear to the
committee that the freeze on pay bills was separate from the freeze on
running costs, so savings from running costs could not finance a pay rise.
Many employers and union leaders had hoped it would be possible to subsidise
pay rises from both and had expected rises of up to 3 per cent in 1994-95.
This clarification means that a pay rise for civil servants, for example,
can come only from the Pounds 11.7bn pay bill and not the Pounds 20.1bn
total running costs for central government departments in 1994-95.
Referring to the pay review bodies that make pay rise recommendations, Mr
Portillo said: 'If what they propose is to be acceptable it has got to be an
increase which can be funded out of efficiency. If it goes beyond that then
the implication would either be that their proposal would not be acceptable
or that their increase could only be made at the expense of delivery of
services.'

FT  20 JAN 94 / Cross-party group of MPs backs Clarke's fiscal policies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A cross-party panel of MPs yesterday gave its backing to the tightening of
fiscal policy in Mr Kenneth Clarke's first Budget, arguing that the
'dramatic' adjustment of the balance between fiscal and monetary policy was
'very welcome' for the economy's medium-term prospects.
But in its report on the November 30 Budget the Treasury and civil service
committee was less enthusiastic about the government's approach to monetary
policy.
The MPs said the budget statement and the Treasury 'Red Book', detailing
budget measures, failed to give sufficient analysis of the factors
influencing monetary policy and concluded that the true test of its
credibility would come only when inflationary pressures re-emerged.
The MPs said they were not concerned about rising prices in the short term.
They agreed with the government that average annual growth of 3 per cent for
the UK economy was a reasonable medium-term projection. They judged the
Budget's public expenditure plans 'broadly realistic', although the
government's success in hitting the spending targets in the 'new control
total' were 'more contingent on the outturn for inflation and growth than
the Treasury admits'.
Among a host of detailed points, the panel:
Criticised Mr Clarke for introducing revenue raising measures, such as 15
per cent reliefs on allowances, that 'departed from the principles of
simplicity and neutrality in taxation'.
Urged him to be more open about the government's plans for mortgage interest
relief, arguing that it would be better to announce plans for its phased and
complete abolition than restrict its scope by stealth.
Called on the Central Statistical Office to conduct a special inquiry and
report publicly on the accuracy of UK trade figures.
At a press conference yesterday committee members differed over the current
level of interest rates. Mr Giles Radice, the Labour MP for Durham North,
said that there was a growing case for a cut in base rates from 5.5 per
cent.
Mr Radice and Mr Alan Beith, the Liberal Democrat MP for Berwick-upon-Tweed,
criticised Budget plans to cut public-sector capital spending. Mr Beith
added that the government was denying itself an opportunity to generate
employment.

FT  20 JAN 94 / Budget pushes up inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The jump in the annual rate of headline inflation to 1.9 per cent in
December - from 1.4 per cent in November - was largely due to Budget excise
duty changes and the effect of mortgage rate cuts in December 1992 falling
out of the index. Underlying inflationary pressures still appear relatively
subdued.
December's retail price index was 141.9 (1987=100), 0.2 per cent higher than
November's 141.6. The annual increase was slightly lower than expected and
meant that the headline rate stayed below 2 per cent for a full calendar
year for the first time since 1946.
The underlying annual rate of inflation excluding mortgage interest payments
was 2.7 per cent, up from 2.5 per cent in November. But the Budget increases
in excise duties, notably on petrol and tobacco, added about 0.3 per cent to
the index, indicating that prices might otherwise have fallen during the
month.
The Central Statistical Office calculates that about three-quarters of the
effect of increased excise duties came through in December. The main
exception was tobacco, where wholesalers stocked up heavily before the
Budget.
Tobacco prices rose 2 per cent between November and December, but this
change represents only about 40 per cent of the expected Budget increase.
Motoring costs rose 1 per cent from November to December, for an annual
increase of 5 per cent. Petrol prices increased by about 10p per gallon  -
rather than 13.6p per gallon if the Budget increase had been passed on in
full. Increased petrol costs were offset by price reductions in the
second-hand car market.
Food prices rose 0.2 per cent between November and December, for an annual
rise of 0.8 per cent, but non-seasonal foods declined in price, particularly
beef, soft drinks and dairy products. The annual increase in non-seasonal
food prices, at 1.1 per cent, was the lowest since 1967.
Household goods prices, up 0.7 per cent, also recorded the lowest annual
increase since 1967, although they rose by 0.5 per cent between November and
December.
Alcohol prices fell 0.3 per cent on the month due to retailers offering
reductions in the approach to Christmas.
The main inflation measures are expected to rise further this month, as the
0.9 per cent fall in the RPI of January last year, caused by sharp
discounting in the new year sales, falls out of the calculations.
Mr Ian Shepherdson of Greenwell Montagu expects the January headline rate to
be 2.5 per cent and the underlying rate to be about 3 per cent.
He expects the rates to subside in subsequent months, however, and pointed
to the Bank of England's preferred inflationary measure RPI Y, which
excludes mortgages, indirect taxes and local authority taxes. Greenwell
Montagu estimates that this measure fell to 2.3 per cent in December, from
2.6 per cent in November.
The Retail Price Index is complied by the Central Statistics Office using a
selection of more than 600 goods and services and based on 150,000 separate
price quotations each month.

FT  20 JAN 94 / Venables keeps control of club
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Terry Venables retained control of his social club Scribes West yesterday
when a deal to save the business from insolvency proceedings was finalised
in the high court.
By agreement the court dismissed a winding-up petition based on a debt of
pounds 150,000 claimed by Mr Vincent Isaacs, chairman of insurance group
general portfolio, who was a backer of the original Scribes Club near Fleet
Street.
At a two-minute hearing Mr Justice Knox was told a sum of money -
undisclosed but believed to be about pounds 50,000 - had been paid 'in full
and final satisfaction' of the petitioner's claim against Scribes West in
Kensington, West London.
The petition was supported by customs and excise, claiming a vat debt, but
it did not apply to be substituted as petitioner or take any part in the
proceedings. No order for costs was sought against the club company.

FT  20 JAN 94 / Tough pay freeze foreseen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's proposed freeze on the pay bill for 4.5m public-sector
employees could be tougher than expected judging by details uncovered in the
commons treasury and civil service committee's report on the budget.
Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the treasury, made clear to the
committee that the freeze on pay bills was separate from the freeze on
running costs, so savings from running costs could not finance a pay rise.
many employers and union leaders had hoped it would be possible to subsidise
pay rises from both and had expected rises of up to 3 per cent in 1994-95.
This clarification means that a pay rise for civil servants, for example,
can come only from the pounds 11.7bn pay bill and not the pounds 20.1bn
total running costs for central government departments in 1994-95.
The trades union congress said last night that restriction made big job
losses in the public sector more likely.
Mr Portillo also had some direct words for the pay review bodies which make
pay rise recommendations for about 1.5m workers. 'They (the review bodies)
need to understand that there is a freeze on pay bills, that there is a
freeze on running costs,' he said. 'If what they propose is to be acceptable
it has got to be an increase which can be funded out of efficiency.
'If it goes beyond that then the implication would either be that their
proposal would not be acceptable or that their increase could only be made
at the expense of delivery of services'.
This may dismay some members of pay review bodies who believe their job is
to set pay levels regardless of government targets.

FT  20 JAN 94 / Services hit as recovery slows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's recovery is slowing, particularly in the service sector, and
recent gains in employment may be reversed in the current quarter, the
British chambers of commerce warned yesterday.
The chambers said their latest quarterly survey of 8,105 companies in
manufacturing and services showed that growth of sales and orders flattened
in the fourth quarter, setting a 'glass ceiling' on expansion that was well
below pre-recession levels.
Manufacturing exports proved an exception with substantially more
manufacturers reporting a rise in sales and orders compared with those
reporting a fall.
The poll, carried out between November 26 and December 17, showed a jump in
the balance of manufacturers reporting higher export sales to plus 26 per
cent in the last quarter from plus 12 per cent in the third quarter, while
the balance of those reporting higher orders increased to 20 per cent from 9
per cent.
But this positive news was offset by slight falls in home orders for
manufacturers and service companies. the balance of manufacturers reporting
higher home orders fell for the first time in more than a year to plus 21
per cent from 23 per cent, while the balance of domestic orders for the
service industry slipped by 1 point to plus 18 per cent.
The chambers said manufacturers were unlikely to experience significantly
higher sales growth in the current quarter while results from the service
sector were disappointing. big service-sector companies experienced the
greatest slowdown in order growth.
Mr Christopher Stewart smith, BCC president, said the recovery 'remains
finely balanced and could easily be blown off course. it is not yet strong
enough to have a significant impact on employment.'
The survey found that on balance 4 per cent of manufacturing companies
expect to reduce their workforces in the current quarter, with job losses
concentrated among large and medium-sized employers. The service sector
expects to increase labour slightly, with 3 per cent of companies planning
to raise staff. These are concentrated among small and medium-sized firms,
however, while most large service companies expect to downsize.
The sluggish economic recovery resulted in a largely unchanged rate of
growth of investment plans between the third and fourth quarters. There was
a slight divergence in capacity utilisation between service companies, where
one in five reported working at full capacity, and manufacturing, where
improved export business lifted the proportion of full-capacity companies to
about one in four.
The chambers' assessment of business confidence showed a similar contrast.
Expectations of improved profits and turnover slipped slightly among service
companies while hopes of higher sales and earnings among manufacturers rose.
The chambers said London and the thames valley were among the most buoyant
UK regions while recovery in Scotland lagged the rest of the UK.
Mr Richard Brown, the chambers' deputy director-general, said a slowdown was
'very worrying' for the service sector because it was more sensitive to
consumer demand.

FT  20 JAN 94 / Doubt cast on strength of rise in consumer spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The ability of consumer spending to withstand tax increases in the spring is
thrown into doubt today by a survey showing that increases in spending are
still taking place, but with little or no acceleration.
The January regional consumer survey by gallup and business strategies (BSL)
says consumers are more pessimistic about prospects for their finances in
the coming year. for most regions, this result is the worst since mid-1990.
Ms Bridget Rosewell, joint managing director of bsl said: 'the results
suggest that consumers are taking a realistic view of their position.
'While they clearly recognise that they are going to be worse off over the
coming year, they also show every sign of maintaining the steady rise in
spending which has been apparent for the last couple of years,' she said.
In the three months to December consumer spending increased fastest in the
South-West and the south-east and slowest in scotland and wales. the last
two regions are also among the most pessimistic about the outlook for
unemployment.
Consumers remain sceptical that the government will be able to keep
inflation low.
Ms Rosewell said: 'they expect the rate of inflation to be about 5.5 per
cent by the end of 1994, and this may be encouraging them to run down their
savings now in order to keep spending levels up.'
Less than 45 per cent of consumers think this is a good time to save,
compared with more than 65 per cent at the beginning of 1991, according to
the survey.

FT  20 JAN 94 / Sales leave house prices flat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Demand from home buyers increased last month but the rise in sales has not
brought a corresponding rise in prices, a survey of more than 100 estate
agents reported yesterday.
The study, by the royal institution of chartered surveyors, reported that 90
per cent of agents in england and wales had seen no increase in prices in
the last three months of last year, compared with the previous three months.
Just under 5 per cent per cent said that prices had continued to fall while
a similar proportion reported increases of 2 per cent over the period.
The institution said that prices had remained flat in spite of an Increase
in house viewings and inquiries from potential purchasers. sellers still
needed to set a realistic asking price to secure a sale.
Confidence among potential buyers had grown as house prices had stabilised
and unemployment figures had improved. the 'upbeat mood' was most pronounced
in the south of england.
One agent in swindon said three houses that had remained unsold for a long
time had been bought by newcomers relocating to the town.
Agents in Newbury, Portsmouth, Bishop's Stortford and Sidmouth reported
similar optimism.
The institution expects the improvement in sales to continue but it warned
that the recovery in prices would be slower.
It said: 'the number of transactions will have to increase before there will
be any meaningful impact on prices, which will rise only slowly throughout
the year.'

FT  20 JAN 94 / MoD widens scope for deal at Swans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Ministry of Defence would be in a position to award a contract to Swan
Hunter, the stricken Tyneside shipyard, if a potential purchaser was willing
to underwrite the bid, it emerged yesterday.
Since Swans went into receivership in May the MoD has said the yard can
tender for orders, but an award can be made only if it is on a sound
financial footing.
It became apparent yesterday, however, that a potential bidder would have
the option of backing a bid for an order before committing itself to buying
the yard.
Mr Nick Brown, Labour MP for Newcastle upon Tyne East, spoke after a meeting
yesterday with defence procurement minister Mr Jonathan Aitken. He said the
minister had confirmed that if a potential purchaser was willing to offer
guarantees, it would be possible for the MoD to place a contract with the
yard.
Mr Brown said: 'This gives the company the chance to make the transition
from receivership to private ownership on the back of an award of a contract
from the MoD.'
Swan Hunter's remaining 1,080 employees are fitting out its last orders  -
two Type 23 frigates. The company's sale prospects could be greatly enhanced
if it could win the Pounds 30m refit of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary supply
vessel Sir Bedivere, for which the MoD has invited tenders.
Mr Ed James of receivers Price Waterhouse welcomed the suggestion that
potential purchasers' involvement could help win MoD orders. But he added:
'The receivers still believe they will only gain work from the MoD if the
yard is financially stable, and that means finding a buyer.'

FT  20 JAN 94 / Customs warns Eurotunnel over its security measures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Customs officials have warned Eurotunnel that attempts to police the Channel
tunnel once it opens will be undermined by the company's rules on obtaining
information on passengers.
According to a senior official, there are concerns that Customs will not
have the information it needs, although passengers will be subject to
standard passport checks.
'From a purely Customs point of view, it's going to mean more drugs getting
through. From a security angle, it could mean that some terrorists will be
travelling and no one will pick them up,' he said.
Customs views the threat as so serious that it has been considering asking
the government to put pressure on Eurotunnel, the tunnel operator, to change
its practices.
However, the company said last night: 'We never intended to give full
passenger details. We are a railway, not a ferry company. It's a
turn-up-and-go system. We think the controls we will have will be
sufficient.'
Customs officials believe that effective policing of Channel crossings is
dependent on being given full information on vehicle registrations,
passengers and freight. The system planned by Eurotunnel will limit the
information it can give to Customs to advance reservations only, which it is
estimated will account for only about 30 per cent of those actually using
the trains on any particular day.
A senior Customs official said: 'If we are not given full information as to
who is travelling, we can't select individuals for target searching based on
intelligence.' Claims that the first year of the Single Market would provide
opportunities for drugs smuggling have been disproved, Sir John Cope,
paymaster-general, said yesterday.
Sir John, the minister responsible for Customs, said: 'After this first year
it is clear that our anti-smuggling controls, together with
intelligence-based strategies, have maintained effectiveness in the fight
against drugs.'

Michael Sydney, export director of Lock &amp; Co, a hat shop in central London
which was founded in 1676. The company was yesterday presented with the
NatWest Export Award for small businesses, given to companies with an annual
turnover of less than Pounds 1m. Mr Sydney said turnover had increased by
about 350 per cent - to Pounds 500,000 - over the past two years.
He said the best-selling lines were tweed caps, which are popular in Italy,
France, Germany and Belgium, and felt trilbies, which Italians are
particularly keen on.
Americans and the Japanese sometimes buy bowlers, Mr Sydney said, although
he added: 'Don't ask me what they use them for.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Renault UK is launching a fresh weapon in the UK new car sales war -
accident management on each car sold.
It has formed a venture with Accident Management Company, part of a
northern-based fleet management group, to take over administration of the
entire aftermath of an accident, from contact with insurers to overseeing
repairs, at no cost to the motorist.
The scheme, available for fleet and private buyers, already covers 31,000
Renault vehicles in the UK and is expected to be extended to more than
130,000 by the end of this year.

FT  20 JAN 94 / Group of Names accepts offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Names on one of the worst-hit syndicates at Lloyd's of London yesterday
agreed to accept the insurance market's Pounds 900m deal to settle legal
action outside the courts, Richard Lapper writes.
A total of 215 members of the Merrett syndicate 421 Names Action Group have
been offered about Pounds 5m in compensation for losses of more than Pounds
16m. More than 22,000 Names - individuals whose assets support the insurance
market - have until the middle of next month to accept or reject the offer.
Mr John Franklin, chairman of the action group, said the offer had 'some
unsatisfactory features'. But litigation would be expensive and there was no
certainty that Names would win in the courts.
By contrast, two of the largest groups of lossmakers - Gooda Walker and
Merrett 418 Names - have rejected the offer in favour of legal action.

FT  20 JAN 94 / BAA backs new airline at Gatwick
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BAA, the airports operator, and British Aerospace are backing a proposal by
an Italian airline entrepreneur to start a European scheduled airline based
at London's Gatwick airport.
The new airline, Debonair, plans to operate up to seven jets from Gatwick to
European destinations including Paris, Amsterdam, Munich, Berlin, Rome,
Milan, Madrid, and Barcelona.
The airline is being set up by Mr Franco Mancassola, a former senior
executive with Continental Airlines and World Airways of the US, who has 30
years' experience in the international airline industry.
Mr Mancassola said yesterday he had already raised Pounds 6.5m of the Pounds
13m equity finance for his new airline and planned to launch Gatwick
scheduled services next autumn.
BAA supports the venture because it has the potential to fill the gap left
at Gatwick by the collapse of Air Europe and the demise of Dan-Air, which
has been absorbed by British Airways.
Mr Allan Munds, Gatwick airport's managing director, said passenger traffic
on European scheduled routes from Gatwick had fallen from 5.5m-3.5m in the
past three years.
With BA dominating short-haul European scheduled airline services from
Gatwick, Mr Munds said many long-haul airlines using the airport were keen
to see a new airline offering European services from Gatwick.
The government's liberalisation of London air traffic rules has encouraged
many international airlines to switch services from Gatwick to Heathrow,
which has become overcrowded.
Both BAA and the international carriers using Gatwick see a new entrant as
creating greater competition and choice at Gatwick.
The new airline plans to start services in September using four BAe 146
regional jets leased from British Aerospace. Mr Mancassola plans to increase
the fleet to seven by the summer of 1995.
Mr Robin Southwell, of BAe's asset management organisation, said the UK
manufacturer was backing the new venture and proposing to lease the first
four aircraft for a total of Dollars 500,000 a month.
Apart from daily scheduled services to European business cities, the new
airline plans weekend services to leisure centres including Nice and Venice.

FT  20 JAN 94 / Smith attacks Labour MP for appearing on Iraq TV
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ and KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, yesterday delivered a strong reprimand to
Mr George Galloway, Labour MP for Glasgow Hillhead, for appearing on Iraqi
television with President Saddam Hussein.
Mr Galloway, who has strongly opposed United Nations sanctions on Iraq, was
quoted as saying to Mr Saddam: 'Sir, allow me to salute your courage, power
and indefatigability. I would like you to know that we are with you until
Nasir (victory).'
Mr Smith issued a statement deploring 'foolish statements' made by Mr
Galloway. He said Mr Galloway would be interviewed by Mr Derek Foster, the
opposition chief whip, when he returned to the Commons.
Labour MPs speculated that the party might go as far as to 'withdraw the
whip' from Mr Galloway, preventing him from attending meetings of the
parliamentary Labour party and voting in backbench elections.
A prominent backbencher said sentiment was running high against Mr Galloway,
whose visit was 'unauthorised'.
However, Mr Galloway said his remarks had been misinterpreted. 'It was not
to Saddam Hussein, it was to allow me to salute the Iraqi people's courage,
power and indefatigability in the face of the enormous barrage of explosive
ordnance and strangulating blockade,' he said.
Mr Galloway sought to undermine criticism by linking his concern for
ordinary Iraqis with his long-standing opposition to British arms sales to
the Baghdad government.
The government moved quickly to exploit Labour's embarrassment, which
Conservative officials hope will help to deflect attention from Mr John
Major's troubled back to basics campaign.
Sir Norman Fowler, chairman of the Conservative party, said Mr Smith should
demand a full retraction from Mr Galloway, or expel him from the
parliamentary party.
A senior Labour official said no action would be taken against Mr Galloway
until a full inquiry had been completed.

FT  20 JAN 94 / BCCI 'had help in overstating profits by Dollars 30m'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The former property entrepreneur, Mr Nazmudin Virani, helped the Bank of
Credit and Commerce International carry out its massive international fraud
by signing bogus documents enabling the bank to overstate its profits by
Dollars 30m (Pounds 20.2m), an Old Bailey jury heard yesterday.
The assistance given by Mr Virani, the former head of Control Securities,
the property and leisure group, enabled BCCI to deceive the Bank of England
into renewing its banking licence. It could therefore continue taking
deposits from the public long after it was insolvent, Mr Anthony Hacking QC
told the court.
Mr Hacking was opening the third prosecution brought by the Serious Fraud
Office over the collapse of BCCI. Mr Virani denies one count of conspiring
to defraud BCCI depositors, 11 counts of furnishing false information to
Price Waterhouse, the bank's auditors, one count of theft and one of false
accounting.
Mr Hacking said Mr Virani's co-conspirator in the fraud was Mr Mohammed
Haque, the former head of BCCI's property division in the UK. After the
collapse of the bank in July 1991 Mr Haque fled to Pakistan from where he
could not be extradited to the UK.
Mr Hacking said that Mr Virani was the largest customer of BCCI's property
division. He and Mr Haque developed a 'you scratch my back and I'll scratch
yours' relationship.
Together they embarked on a fraud that benefited both BCCI and Mr Virani's
private property empire, Mr Hacking said.
As BCCI's financial troubles increased in the mid-1980s Mr Virani signed a
series of bogus documents to help 'plug the gaps' in the bank's accounts and
hide the truth about its financial position.
The documents, sent to Price Waterhouse, stated that Mr Virani's companies
owed substantial sums to BCCI - loans which the auditors treated as BCCI
assets. In fact his companies had no such loans with BCCI and the device was
simply a means of fooling the auditors and inflating the bank's profits, Mr
Hacking said.
In return BCCI afforded Mr Virani extra banking facilities and played a
substantial role in the expansion of Control Securities by underwriting its
share placings. The bank also gave Mr Virani cash payments totalling at
least Pounds 1.6m, he said.
On one occasion Mr Virani picked up Pounds 200,000 in cash from BCCI's
London offices. In 1988 Mr Virani was granted a Pounds 1m loan but made no
repayments before the bank collapsed three years later, he said.
Mr Hacking told the jury: 'You will have to decide whether the Pounds 1m
received in June 1988 was a genuine loan or a sham which may be described as
a reward for services provided or as a sweetener for future co-operation.'
He said the jury should not be deflected by criticisms made of Price
Waterhouse and the Bank of England.
'Mr Virani was the willing and essential partner in a fraud by his bankers
on their system and potential depositors,' Mr Hacking said.
The trial, expected to last about three months, continues today.

FT  20 JAN 94 / P&amp;O threatens staff with dismissal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
P&amp;0 European Ferries has threatened to dismiss more than 1,000 of its
employees if they refuse to accept new conditions of employment. The company
has also threatened to sack them if they strike against the proposals.
Mr Geoff Christian, the company's fleet director at Felixstowe, said: 'We
don't want a confrontation but a negotiated settlement.'
Final negotiations are due to take place tomorrow between crew and
shore-staff unions at Felixstowe in Suffolk, Larne in Northern Ireland and
Cairnryan in Galloway over company plans to cut wage costs from Pounds 10m
to Pounds 7.5m a year.
Members of the RMT maritime union at Felixstowe, Larne and Cairnryan last
week voted by 319 to 36 to back industrial action and reject the company's
proposals.
Mr Christian said he was asking for a report from the Electoral Reform
Society on the validity of the ballot. The RMT must give six days notice of
its strike intentions and it has yet to do so.
The company warned yesterday that it had gone as far it could in making
'considerable concessions' to changes in working practices. It had agreed to
scale back its proposed job reduction of 240 by half. Mr Christian said last
night he was hopeful the unions would accept improved redundancy terms.
Talks are continuing between the two sides at P&amp;O's Portsmouth operations.
Last week maritime officers in Dover accepted the company's terms; the rest
of the workforce is non-union.
Mr Tony Santamera, the RMT's national officer, said yesterday members were
'extremely angry' at the company's attitude. He said the union's negotiators
had been told by management that those refusing to work under the new
conditions would be fired.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Loganair, the airline, is shedding 250 jobs in a shake-up of services. It is
to concentrate on 'lifeline' services to the Scottish Highlands and Islands,
handing over other services from Glasgow, Edinburgh and Manchester to its
sister company, Manx Airlines. The two companies form part of airlines of
Britain holdings.
Loganair, which employs 560 people, said about 80 of the affected employees
would be transferred to Manx, resulting in a net cut of about 170 jobs. All
services operated by the two airlines would be retained.

Fears that the first year of the single market would provide opportunities
for drugs smuggling have been disproved, Sir John Cope, paymaster-general,
said yesterday, Jimmy Burns writes.
Sir John, the minister responsible for customs, said: 'after this first year
it is clear that our anti-smuggling controls, together with
intelligence-based strategies, have maintained effectiveness in the fight
against drugs.'
Cannabis seizures rose 19 per cent in 1992-93 to a record 53 tons, with a
street value of pounds 176m. Synthetic drug seizures rose 215 per cent to
1,097kg with a street value of pounds 133m. seizures of heroin increased by
25 per cent to 562kg (pounds 98m).
The number of people arrested in the uk as a result of international drug
operations rose 29 per cent to 3,302 and resulted in 69 smuggling gangs
being smashed.
But cocaine seizures fell 33 per cent from the record 2,250kg in 1992 to
748kg.

FT  20 JAN 94 / Westminster council defence faces challenge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS, STEWART DALBY and PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The principal defence of the Westminster councillors, who were named by the
district auditor for alleged gerrymandering in the sale of council houses in
marginal wards, is challenged by documents obtained by the Financial Times.
Many of the councillors, including Dame Shirley Porter, former leader of the
council, have argued that they had received legal advice approving the sales
policy.
But a transcript of an interview by Mr John Magill, the district auditor, of
Mr Jeremy Sullivan, the barrister who advised Westminster city council on
its now-abandoned policy, which was conducted on November 12 1992, indicates
that had Mr Sullivan been fully briefed on the council's motives, he would
not have endorsed the policy.
Mr Sullivan believes he was not shown vital papers on the policy's effect on
the homeless.
Mr Magill has called Westminster council's policy 'disgraceful and improper'
and provisionally recommended that 10 councillors and officials be
surcharged Pounds 21.25m over their involvement in the affair.
In the transcript, Mr Magill puts the question in the following terms: ''The
majority party nearly lost the election, and since then they have been
talking about targeting marginal wards. We are collecting data on these
eight wards, we are talking about designating all the properties in those
eight wards' and that was the sort of background flavour, what is your view
of that?' Mr Sullivan replied: 'I would have said: 'It is unlawful.' If that
is the way it has been put.'
A letter from Mr Merv Montacute, the council's managing director, to Mr
Andrew Dismore, the council's Labour leader, indicates that Mr Sullivan did
not see the final draft of the reports drawn up by council officials for the
council's housing committee.
The letter also says: 'My understanding of the position is that Mr Sullivan
was not shown a list identifying specific properties for designation.'
Mr Sullivan did not see another key report - Westminster Housing and
Economic Study - which was commissioned by the council from PA Cambridge
Economic Consultants. The report made clear in 1987 that there was a serious
and worsening homeless problem in the area. It said: 'Housing problems for
the most vulnerable groups are getting worse, an impression confirmed by the
continuing high level of homelessness.'
This finding is crucial in the light of Mr Magill's provisional view that
the council's sales policy was 'inconsistent with the statutory duties which
the council owed to the homeless.
In his interview Mr Magill showed Mr Sullivan the two volumes of the report,
to discover if he had been asked to read it.
Mr Sullivan replied: 'I think I should have a fit if I had been asked to do
that. I certainly was not. I am not sure whether I have ever been asked to
read that, even in preparation for the judicial review proceedings.'
Mr Magill said in the public statement made last week: 'No local housing
authority acting reasonably would adopt a policy, the anticipated
consequences of which were that the number of homeless households placed in
temporary accommodation would increase by 172 each year and that the net
revenue costs to the council would increase by over Pounds 1.5m in each
succeeding year.'

FT  20 JAN 94 / Political Notebook: Paying for the sins of a predecessor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is in Exodus after the flight from Egypt that the unforgiving God of the
Old Testament delivers his warning to the chosen people: 'I the Lord thy God
am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children ..'
Mr John Major knows what that means.
Buffeted by the political fall-out from Scott inquiry into arms sales to
Iraq, the shady dealings by Westminster's Tory council and an aid-and-arms
deal with Malaysia, Mr Major is paying for his predecessor's sins.
He is furious about Labour's attempt to pin the sleaze label on his
government. He is an honest politician. He does not like being branded the
leader of a bunch of crooks.
But take them aside and many Conservatives will readily acknowledge that
after so long in office any party runs the risk of becoming corrupted by the
habit of power.
That, they judge, is what happened in Mrs Margaret Thatcher's third term of
office. The massive mistakes in public policy - over the poll tax and Europe
to name but two - after her third election victory in 1987 were mirrored by
an arrogant disregard of accepted standards in the private business of
government.
'It was corrupt,' admits one minister who served in that administration.
That is not to say individuals were making money out of their position in
government, but otherwise, 'anything went as far as No 10 was concerned'.
Sales of machine tools to Iraqi arms factories and Whitehall's subsequent
indifference to the fate in the courts of three directors of Matrix
Churchill were typical of the mood.
The inquiry by Lord Justice Scott has not uncovered any great conspiracy. Mr
Major's exposition on Monday of his distinctly bit-part role in the affair
was convincing. Labour understandably want to pin blame directly on him but
the effort does not carry great conviction.
What the hundreds of hours and thousands of pages of evidence to Scott do
reveal is an unapologetic contempt among some - not all - ministers and
officials for their own rules and for the institution of parliament.
For all the sophistry now being employed to argue that there is no case to
answer, it is hard to find anyone in the senior ranks of the government who
does not expect Scott to reach some damning conclusions.
The decision by the Thatcher government to devote Pounds 300m of Britain's
overseas aid budget to an uneconomical hydro-electricity project on the
banks of Malaysia's Pergau river is part of the same picture.
Ministers deny the scheme was linked explicitly to a Pounds 1bn arms deal
negotiated personally by Mrs Thatcher. When Mr Major gave final approval to
the project in 1991 he was simply handing over a cheque she had promised. He
received the assurance of Whitehall lawyers that there was no illegality.
But those familiar with both the aid agreement and the 'coincidental' arms
deal say that the denials of a link are accurate in only the strictest
terms.
The Thatcher government did not promise specifically the Pergau dam in
return for the arms contracts. But a few months earlier Mrs Thatcher's
office had make a direct link between the arms sales and the aid package
from which Pergau was eventually financed.
Then there is the alleged gerrymandering by Westminster council. It cannot
be laid directly at the government's door. Lady Porter, the colourful then
leader of the Tory group, made her own judgments. Nor is there anything
particularly new in local authorities seeking to rig election results.
The brazen self-confidence behind a scheme that the district auditor
estimates cost the people of Westminster more than Pounds 20m reflected the
climate of the time, however. No one denies that the leader of what was
proclaimed the Tories' flagship council was a frequent and honoured guest at
No 10.
So what, Mr Major might say. My government is different. It set up the Scott
inquiry. It has actually promoted the civil servant who brought the doubts
over the Malaysia project into the public domain. If the Westminster charges
are proved, it will condemn the guilty.
But the prime minister remains unwilling or unable to make a clean break.
Apart from the occasional slip that provides a glimpse of his true feelings
 -'The golden age that never was' is the best example - Mr Major continues
to defend the actions of his predecessor.
He should instead disown them. He might even, on occasion, apologise for
them. The forgiving God of the New Testament did after all tell us how past
sins could be absolved.

FT  20 JAN 94 / Successful peace initiative 'would boost Ulster tourism'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A successful peace initiative in Northern Ireland would prompt a 40 per cent
rise in tourist numbers to 1.77m a year within three to five years and
create 'many thousands of new jobs', Mr Hugh O'Neil, chairman of the
Northern Ireland Tourist Board, said yesterday.
He said tourist numbers to Northern Ireland rose last year for the fifth
consecutive year. Final figures for have still to be compiled, but tourist
inquiries and hotel occupancy rates showed increases over 1992 for the first
half, with inquiries up 70 per cent.
Last year the NITB launched a marketing campaign which, for the first time,
used television advertising in the Republic of Ireland, Scotland and
northern England. The NITN has also expandedoffice representation in Europe,
North America and Australasia.
Investment in the tourist industry in the province is estimated at Pounds
200m over the past five years. Mr O'Neil said: 'While much of this
development has been provided by the public sector we expect it to be a
stimulus to investment from the private sector in 1994, particularly in new
accommodation.'
In 1992, the last year for which complete figures are available, there were
1.25m visitors to Northern Ireland. One in five of these were purely for
holiday purposes, 500,000 were visiting friends or relatives, while 500,000
were on business or for 'other purposes'.
Larne, the main commercial and passenger port between the UK and Northern
Ireland, reported a record of 1.8m passengers last year, an increase of 10.4
per cent. Car and caravan numbers rose 12.7 per cent to 414,000, while
commercial vehicles rose to 364,000 and cargo handled reached 4.3m net
tonnes, all breaking previous records.
The government is to spend Pounds 2.5m refurbishing Northern Ireland's
parliament building at Stormont in Belfast. The building, opened in 1932,
needs work including new water and electrical services. The parliament was
dissolved in 1972 when London introduced direct rule.

FT  20 JAN 94 / MoD offers contract deal to potential shipyard buyer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Ministry of Defence would be in a position to award a contract to Swan
Hunter, the stricken Tyneside shipyard, if a potential purchaser was willing
to underwrite the bid, it emerged yesterday.
Since Swans went into receivership in May the MoD has said the yard can
tender for orders, but an award can be made only if it is on a sound
financial footing.
It became apparent yesterday, however, that a potential bidder would have
the option of backing a bid for an order before committing itself to buying
the yard in the north east.
Mr Nick Brown, Labour MP for Newcastle upon Tyne East, said after a meeting
yesterday with defence procurement minister Mr Jonathan Aitken, that the
minister had confirmed that if a potential purchaser were willing to offer
the guarantees the MoD required it would be possible for the department to
place a contract with the yard.
Mr Brown said: 'This gives the company the chance to make the transition
from receivership to private ownership on the back of an award of a contract
from the MoD.'
Swan Hunter's remaining 1,080 employees are fitting out its last orders  -
two Type 23 frigates.
The company's sale prospects could be greatly enhanced if it could win the
refit of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary supply vessel Sir Bedivere, for which the
MoD has invited tenders by the end of March. The refit will cost about
Pounds 30m.
At the meeting with Mr Aitken Mr Brown and Mr Stephen Byers, Wallsend Labour
MP, expressed concern that rival bidders might try to delay the tendering
process, knowing that the order could be critical to Swan Hunter. Mr Aitken
said he would be sensitive to delaying tactics.
Mr Ed James of receivers Price Waterhouse welcomed the suggestion that
potential purchasers' involvement could help win MoD orders. But he added:
'The receivers still believe they will only gain work from the MoD if the
yard is financially stable, and that means finding a buyer.'

FT  20 JAN 94 / Mexican uprising dents Colosio's image: The sudden emergence
of an old rival puts the presidential favourite under pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Three weeks ago Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio, the presidential candidate of
Mexico's ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, was preparing for an
electoral campaign which many assumed would be little more than a formality.
Like all his party's previous candidates, he was overwhelming favourite to
become Mexico's next head of state.
Today such complacency has been dented. The New Year's uprising in the
impoverished southern state of Chiapas, in which more than 100 people have
died, and sudden re-emergence of Mr Manuel Camacho, his main rival for the
party nomination, have fuelled old doubts about Mr Colosio's credentials for
the job, and raised new ones about unity in the PRI.
The uprising in Chiapas, although confined to a few thousand guerrillas, has
given fresh weight to criticisms of the economic and political model
followed by President Carlos Salinas. As the hand-picked successor to Mr
Salinas, and self-styled candidate of continuity, Mr Colosio and his
programme have been wounded by such attacks.
While the Chiapas uprising has focused attention on poverty and
under-development in Mexico, the main beneficiary may not be the leftist
opposition, headed by Mr Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, says Mr Federico Estevez, a
professor at the Itam university. The uprising, he says, will make voters
more worried about personal safety and political stability, and thus wary of
supporting a party that calls for a radical overhaul of the existing
political establishment.
Instead Mr Camacho may emerge as the main winner. After his appointment to
the high-profile job of restoring peace to Chiapas, Mexico's newspaper
columnists immediately speculated that Mr Camacho would use his position to
challenge for the presidency, either from inside or outside the ruling
party.
The speculation was fuelled in part by the announcement that Mr Camacho had
asked not to receive a salary in his new role and would not form part of the
government, freeing him, should he wish, to become a candidate.
Mr Camacho was mayor of Mexico City and a possible presidential candidate
until November, when Mr Colosio was unveiled as the PRI presidential
candidate. In an unusually frank resignation speech, Mr Camacho promised to
continue in politics and fight for advances in democracy. He pledged loyalty
to to the government of President Salinas, but not to the PRI.
The possibility of a Camacho candidacy is still extremely remote. He is not
popular in the PRI, partly because of his desire to introduce more
democratic reforms, nor with the economist technocrats who have risen to
power in the past decade and suspect him of populist tendencies. He would
stand little if any chance of winning as an independent candidate, given the
PRI's huge advantages in organisation and money over other parties.
'Mr Camacho is ambitious but not mad,' says Mr Raymundo Riva Palacio, an
editor at El Financiero newspaper who dismisses speculation of a candidacy
this year.
There is little doubt that Mr Colosio has been damaged by his old rival's
new prominence. The appointment of the ambitious Mr Camacho has made Mr
Colosio look weak. Mr Salinas announced the appointment on the very day Mr
Colosio's election campaign started, suggesting to some a calculated snub.
Mr Colosio has decided to respond to the threat of Mr Camacho by saying next
to nothing - exposing him to further criticism of being weak and
ineffectual. An influential columnist in El Universal described his campaign
as all but invisible.
Mr Colosio's supporters say that there is plenty of time before the August
elections to recover from the poor start, and that any attempt to benefit
from the crisis in Chiapas would backfire. Such views reinforce long-held
criticism that Mr Colosio is too passive and lacks independent ideas to make
a good president.
Mr Colosio's platform will be modified by events in Chiapas. The candidate
will focus more on anti-poverty and regional development aspects of his
programme than hitherto, supporters say. He is also likely to emphasise
further his promise of free and fair elections, in answer to those who argue
that the Chiapas uprising occurred as a result of a lack of democracy in the
country.

FT  20 JAN 94 / Aspin to stay as defence hunt goes on
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Les Aspin, due to step down today as secretary of defence, has agreed to
stay on until the Clinton administration names a new successor, following Mr
Bobby Ray Inman's abrupt withdrawal as nominee to the Pentagon on Tuesday.
As President Bill Clinton left a Washington in the grip of record cold to
inspect the Los Angeles earthquake disaster, there was no word on when a new
candidate would be named, or even if the administration had compiled a
prospective short list.
The search for a new nominee, led by Mr Mack McLarty, White House chief of
staff, only began last weekend, when the president, still in Europe, was
advised of Mr Inman's intention to withdraw.
The retired admiral said that he had recommended a successor but, given the
embarrassment he has caused, it is unlikely to be given any weight. In
effect Mr Clinton is back to where he was two months ago, when it was first
decided to seek Mr Aspin's resignation.
There is a list of people whose names are invariably mentioned for senior
defence positions and it appears to remain as it was, with the subtraction
of Mr Inman's name.
Generally reckoned to be on it are Mr James Woolsey, currently head of the
CIA; Mr William Perry, now deputy secretary of defence; Mr John Deutch,
Pentagon undersecretary for acquisitions; Mr Norman Augustine, head of
Martin Marietta, the leading defence contractor; Senator Sam Nunn of
Georgia, chairman of the Senate armed service committee; and congressman
Dave McCurdy, the Democrat from Oklahoma.
Also mentioned are retired General Colin Powell, former head of the joint
chiefs of staff, and retired Admiral William Crowe, due to be the next
ambassador in London. Both would require waivers from the law preventing
former military men from serving in the Pentagon before a number of years
have elapsed.
Each may have reasons not to accept any offer. Senator Nunn, for example,
seems far too wedded to his power base on Capitol Hill to want to follow Mr
Aspin's path to the Pentagon. General Powell's politics are a closely
guarded secret, as are any political ambitions he may have.

<TEXT>
Tumbling oil prices helped narrow the US trade gap in November by 6.7 per
cent, to Dollars 10.17bn, the Commerce Department said yesterday, Reuter
reports from Washington. In the first 11 months of last year, the trade gap
stood at an annualised Dollars 118.7bn, its highest level since Dollars
152.1bn, in 1987, the department said.
The merchandise trade deficit for October was Dollars 10.9bn, revised from a
previously reported Dollars 10.46bn. The trade deficit with Japan declined
in November to Dollars 5.72bn before seasonal adjustment, after swelling to
Dollars 6.09bn in October.
The department said imports declined by 1.5 per cent in November to Dollars
50.24bn, due largely to a sharp Dollars 115.6m drop in the cost of oil
imports to Dollars 3.09bn. Exports declined by 0.1 per cent to Dollars
40.07bn, reflecting decreases in industrial supplies and materials.

<TEXT>
CBS may have lost its broadcasting rights for American football, but it has
has reasserted its claims as a top sports television network by winning the
US television rights for the 1998 winter Olympics.
The network was due to announce yesterday it had secured the rights for the
winter games, to be held in Nagano, Japan, with a record bid of Dollars 375m
(Pounds 253.3m). CBS televised the Albertville games in 1992 and will also
broadcast next month's winter Olympics in Lillehammer, for which it paid
around Dollars 295m.
The Lillehammer games could draw enormous attention, as the women's figure
skating contest, already one of the most popular television events, is now
rapidly turning into a made-for-TV melodrama after the attack on Ms Nancy
Kerrigan, one of the top US skaters.
CBS was stunned last month when it lost the rights to broadcast games from
the National Football Conference, the top American football league, to Mr
Rupert Murdoch's Fox Network.

FT  20 JAN 94 / Quake turns Californian dream into a nightmare
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LOS ANGELES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The 'California dream' has turned into a nightmare for many residents of
earthquake-stricken Los Angeles.
Monday's pre-dawn quake and the hundreds of aftershocks that continue to
rock the region have destroyed more than homes and structures. For some,
they have wiped out hope.
About 20,000 people in and around the city are estimated to have slept out
of doors on Tuesday night. Scores of dazed, frightened residents of
Northridge, at the epicentre of the quake, were yesterday fleeing the area
after spending two nights without electricity and water.
Their destinations did not seem to matter. 'I've just got to get out of
here,' said a man hauling a mattress on to the back of a pick-up truck.
Furniture and possessions were strewn across the pavement in front of the
building where he and his family had lived.
The death toll rose to 45 after two more victims were found, crushed to
death in their bed in a home in Santa Monica. About 4,800 people were
reported to have been injured.
Flat dwellers seemed to have taken the brunt of the earthquake's deadly
toll. The Meadows Apartments in Northridge, where 16 people were crushed to
death, had become a grisly attraction.
Dozens of similar buildings in surrounding areas were also seriously
damaged. Tilted at precarious angles, broken open by the quake's jolt, they
threatened to collapse with the next strong aftershock.
Incongruous signs - Now Renting and For Lease - still fluttered outside,
even as residents struggled to gather their belongings into cars, trailers
and rented vans. Removal vans were everywhere, double parked on residential
streets, blocking traffic.
Gas leaks remained a fear. Several residential streets in Northridge were
cordoned off by police on Tuesday. Evacuated residents left signs - 'gas
leak' - and personal messages telling where they had gone. Dense smoke
blackened the sky a few miles east, providing pungent evidence of the
danger.
Whole streets of shops were boarded up with plywood. 'Open soon. Big sale,'
was scrawled on one.
A hardware store did a brisk trade, evidence that some, at least, were
determined to put the pieces back together themselves. The half-demolished
Pacific Contractors School for builders offered little encouragement to
those who sought professional assistance.
At the Northridge Fashion Mall, a large shopping centre, people gathered to
gaze at the collapsed multi-storey car park and a Bullocks department store
that appeared to be a write-off. National Guardsmen were stationed outside,
not, they said, to prevent looting but to ensure nobody went too close to
the damaged buildings.
Santa Monica was hard hit as was Simi Valley, the site of the notorious
first trial of the policemen who beat black motorist Rodney King. The
officers' acquittal sparked riots in Los Angeles.
In Studio City, north of Hollywood, homes were destroyed and hundreds of
businesses wrecked.
Elsewhere garden walls collapsed, leaving rubble across the street. It is a
small inconvenience, perhaps, but one that deprived people of privacy as
they camped out in their gardens.
Robbed of control over their lives, people seemed to take out their
frustrations on the streets. At traffic lights, blacked-out by power cuts,
drivers played a deadly game of 'chicken', with predictable results.
Los Angeles commuters were trapped for hours in massive traffic jams
yesterday morning as the ravaged city struggled to return to some semblance
of normality. For most this was the first day back at work since the
earthquake.
For residents of the Santa Clarita Valley, to the north of Los Angeles, a
one-hour commute turned into a three or even four-hour nightmare. With the
main freeway linking the suburban region to the city closed by earthquake
damage, they were forced on to an alternative route, only to have that
partially closed by rock slides following another strong aftershock.
Traffic started to back up as early as 4.30am, according to the California
Highway Patrol (CHP), and by 8.30am many who had started their journeys in
the dark were still on the road.
Although seven highways have been closed by earthquake damage, most freeway
overpasses showed no signs of structural damage. But all would have to be
inspected, officials said, raising the prospect of further problems.
The CHP urged travellers to avoid visiting southern California. 'If you
don't know your way around, you will find yourself in trouble. Even for
people who do know the area, driving is a trying experience,' an official
said.
Damage to the region's water supply systems was one of the most worrying
problems, officials said. Close to 100,000 homes and businesses were without
running water. The Department of Water and Power said three aqueducts had
been ruptured and two pumping plants damaged. There were also many broken
water mains.

   SAO PAULO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Brazil's stalled constitutional review finally resumed yesterday and the
first proposed amendments, including changes to the presidential term, could
be voted on today.
The review, which had been on hold since October because of a corruption
scandal in Congress, is likely to make significant changes to the country's
creaking political system. But amendments to modernise the economy are more
controversial and face considerable opposition.
Mr Nelson Jobim, the review's co-ordinator, has prepared the first tranche
of proposals from an original list of 18,000 suggestions. His proposals
include a cut in the presidential term from five to four years and allowing
holders of executive positions to seek re-election while still in office.
At present, leaders have to resign six months before elections while
presidents and governors cannot hold the same office in consecutive periods.
This system, designed to reduce the advantages of incumbency, has usually
weakened the last year of an elected official's term. 'They only govern for
two years, the rest of the time they are learning to govern or politicking
for the next elections,' according to Mr Jobim.
Other proposed changes include an end to Brazil's compulsory voting laws and
stricter rules to prevent congressmen switching party affiliation mid-term.
Congressional immunity, which is extremely broad and has allowed some
congressmen to escape criminal charges, would in future only extend to
guaranteeing freedom of speech and association. Analysts agree that all
these changes would make small but important changes to the way Brazil is
governed.
Brazil's monthly inflation rate edged through the psychologically important
40 per cent mark in the period between December 16 and January 15, according
to one of the main organisations which track price rises.

<TEXT>
Plutonium may be one of the most toxic substances on earth, but it is safe
enough to drink, says the Japanese government, which is promoting plutonium
before the launch in April of Monju, the country's first fast breeder
reactor.
A cartoon video made last year by Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development
(PNC), an affiliate of the Science and Technology Agency, shows Pluto, an
atom-shaped cartoon character, informing a boy taking gulps from a jug that
drinking water containing plutonium is harmless to the body since it is not
easily absorbed by the stomach and intestines.
The government has been trying to reverse the negative image of nuclear
power which spread among ordinary Japanese since the wave of international
criticism over a shipment of plutonium from France in 1992, and Russia's
dumping of nuclear waste in the Sea of Japan last October.
The video, however, intended for a teenage audience, has alarmed
environmental groups which claim the explanation is highly misleading.
An official at PNC said although the video explained that plutonium was
hazardous to the human body if it was taken into the lungs or absorbed by
the bones, 'we didn't want people to be too scared of plutonium'.
Meanwhile, Japan's nine electricity companies yesterday officially approved
the construction of Monju's successor.
The companies expect the construction of the fast breeder reactor, almost
three times as powerful as Monju, to start early next century, although
plans for financing have yet to be finalised and the site decided on.
The move came as 11 leading US anti-nuclear groups urged the companies to
give up the plutonium programme.

FT  20 JAN 94 / ANC plans shake-up in healthcare system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR

<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG

<TEXT>
The African National Congress said yesterday it planned a big shake-up in
South Africa's healthcare system, with the private sector to be
'discouraged' in favour of a substantial expansion of the public sector.
ANC officials yesterday published a draft national health plan which calls
for private sector healthcare to be brought under the direct control of the
state, which may take steps such as capping the salaries of doctors in the
private sector and regulating their fees to ensure that 'profit is not the
major incentive of practitioners'. The plan also moots a new national
insurance tax.
The aim is to 'fundamentally correct the imbalances of the past', with
whites and wealthy blacks enjoying first-world standard healthcare and most
blacks receiving sub-standard care. However, any move that would jeopardise
the quality of healthcare available from the private sector could
substantially accelerate an already growing trend of white emigration. South
African whites have been used to a high standard of healthcare since 1967
when Dr Christiaan Barnard performed the world's first heart transplant in
Cape Town.
The plan will further exacerbate concerns about the ANC's plans for state
intervention in the post-apartheid economy, ahead of a big economic policy
conference due to be held by the organisation from tomorrow to Sunday.
'We must drastically review how we use our resources,' Ms Cheryl Carolus,
ANC national working committee member in charge of health told reporters in
Johannesburg, saying the state was the most efficient provider of
healthcare. 'Huge problems have been created by thinking that the market can
regulate healthcare,' she said, adding central government had to play a more
dynamic role.
She said the ANC was merely following an international healthcare trend:
'There is international recognition of the central responsibility the
government has in providing healthcare.'

FT  20 JAN 94 / Japan's move over bidding hailed by US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, yesterday hailed Japanese
plans to reform its bidding process in its Dollars 20bn (Pounds 13.4bn) a
year public sector construction market as 'an historic step forward' and
abandoned plans to impose sanctions in the dispute.
'I hope that this positive step sets the stage for concluding meaningful
framework agreements prior to the February 11 meeting between President
Clinton and Prime Minister Hosokawa,' he said.
The US and Japan had agreed at the Tokyo summit to reach agreements, using
'quantitative and qualitative indicators' to measure results, in time for
the bilateral meeting. However, administration officials have been warning
of slow progress.
In a speech this week in Frankfurt, Mr Jeffrey Garten, commerce department
undersecretary, said little progress had been made on issues, such as
government procurement in telecommunications, medical equipment, insurance
and automotive trade.
'We are not seeking to 'manage' our trade,' he said. 'It is more accurate to
say that we are trying to open the Japanese market by seeking to have it
'un-managed'.'
The construction pact contains agreement to track foreign participation
using 'indicators' such as the number of overseas contracts granted and the
value of the contracts. The two sides will have regular annual meetings to
evaluate progress.
In the framework talks, Japanese negotiators have been reluctant to agree to
any supposition about imports on the grounds that 'expectations' agreed in
past semiconductor and car parts pacts have been interpreted by the US side
as market share commitments.
The 'action plan' Tokyo devised gives the US most of what it has demanded
during the years of frustration over the inability of US companies to win
Japanese government construction contracts.
Mr Kantor said there would be 'a lag time' before the contracts won by
foreign companies is felt in their home economies. But he saw this as a
boost for foreign participation in a Dollars 1,000bn infrastructure market
planned in Asia.
Reuter adds from Beijing: US Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen plans to meet
Mr Hosokawa in Tokyo on Sunday to discuss economic framework talks, a US
Treasury Department spokeswoman said yesterday.

FT  20 JAN 94 / Telecoms chief's death shocks Hong Kong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hong Kong's business community was shocked yesterday by the announcement
that Mr Michael Gale, chief executive of Hongkong Telecom, had died suddenly
on Monday evening, Simon Holberton writes.
Mr Gale, 53, died in a local hospital to which he had been admitted last
week for a back operation, of a heart attack. He is survived by a wife and
two children.
Lord Young, executive chairman of Cable and Wireless and chairman of
Hongkong Telecom, a subsidiary, said Mr Gale had brought 'enormous wisdom
and experience' to bear in the performance of his duties.
Mrs Anson Chan, acting governor of Hong Kong, described Mr Gale as one of
the colony's most dynamic and respected citizens.
Hongkong Telecom had planned to announce yesterday that Mr Gale was to be
made the company's deputy chairman. He was to relinquish the chief
executive's role to devote more time to the development of Cable and
Wireless' business interests in Asia.
The company went ahead, however, with the planned announcement that Mr Linus
Cheung had been appointed chief executive. Mr Cheung will take up his duties
at the beginning of May.
He is currently deputy managing director of Cathay Pacific Airways
responsible for the airline's worldwide commercial activities and the most
senior Chinese executive at the airline. His job will be taken by Mr Simon
Heale.
Mr Cheung's appointment was seen as serving a number of interests. With Hong
Kong returning to Chinese sovereignty in 1997 it was seen as politic to have
a Chinese executive at the helm.
He is seen as an effective ambassador for Hongkong Telecom both in the
colony and, importantly, in China, where the company has ambitious plans for
ex-pansion.
Hongkong Telecom has long held that if China is to meet its ambitious plans
for telecommunications development, Beijing will have to permit foreign
investment in the operation of regional telecommunications networks. It is
working closely with telecommunications authorities in both Guangdong and
Fujian provinces.

FT  20 JAN 94 / Right-winger hints at 'looming' violence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
South Africa's most prominent right-wing leader, Gen Constand Viljoen,
yesterday warned that conservative Afrikaners would use violence to bolster
their demand for an ethnic homeland, reflecting an apparent shift in
right-wing strategy toward the greater use of violence.
Gen Viljoen, who has long tried to moderate the actions of his more radical
right-wing colleagues, warned: 'sometimes you have to use a little bit of
violence to prevent further big violence and clashes. There is a clash
looming in our country'. He said the right could prevent next April's
elections altogether if it decided on a boycott.
Gen Viljoen was speaking as the deadline approached for changes to the new
constitution aimed at accommodating the demand for Afrikaner
self-determination. All changes are due to be agreed by next Monday.
Negotiators from the right-wing Freedom Alliance were meeting the African
National Congress and the government to discuss possible changes, but
conservative Afrikaner leaders said they expected little from the talks.
The Afrikaner Volksfront, the umbrella group which Gen Viljoen heads, plans
to declare unilateral independence from South Africa next Saturday unless
its demands are met. It will declare its own 'transitional authority' to
rival the multi-racial Transitional Executive Council set up in December to
oversee the run-up to all-race elections.
ANC leader Nelson Mandela said Gen Viljoen's statements were 'very
regrettable.' Though he sympathised with minority fears, he would never
contemplate a separate state for Afrikaners, though the ANC could accept a
state where Afrikaners exercise autonomy so long as all people in it had the
same citizenship and voting rights.
The secretary-general of the Commonwealth invited post-apartheid South
Africa yesterday to rejoin the association after a break of 33 years, Reuter
reports.

FT  20 JAN 94 / Laos starts to wake up to its energetic neighbours - How
south-east Asia's poorest country is being caught up in the region's growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A casual glance at the national accounts of Laos might give the impression
the country is in sub-Saharan Africa rather than south-east Asia.
Laos imports twice as much as it exports; it is dependent on the assistance
of the International Monetary Fund and other foreign donors; and it is one
of the poorest countries in the world, with an annual per capita gross
domestic product of about Dollars 230 (Pounds 154). Total GDP is Dollars 1bn
a year, less than the turnover of a large corporation in neighbouring
Thailand.
Laos's 4.4m inhabitants are known more for their charm than their
industriousness. Lao rice farmers have a reputation in this dynamic region
for lying down, closing their eyes and listening to their crops growing in
fertile paddy fields.
In towns such as Luang Prabang, Morris Minors and 40-year-old Mercedes
Benzes share the streets with more recent arrivals from Japan. In the
capital, Vientiane, stallholders in the market are trying to sell
old-fashioned Soviet cameras and hi-fi systems as well as Japanese
refrigerators.
Laos, however, is changing fast. Even if it wanted to, this once forgotten
corner of Indo-china could hardly escape the effects of the frenzied
economic growth across its borders in China, Thailand and Vietnam.
Landlocked Laos is already a commercial crossroads of sorts. It levies a
Dollars 1,300 transit fee for new luxury cars - the Toyota Lexus is the
latest favourite - on their way to the tycoons of China's Yunnan province
from ports in the Gulf of Thailand.
In the past such trade was hindered by the difficulty of crossing the Mekong
river, the appalling state of Laos's roads, and the uneasy relationship
between Thailand and the communist government of the Lao People's
Revolutionary party.
These days Thai-Lao relations are much improved, Australia has built the
first bridge across the lower Mekong near Vientiane - a Dollars 30m
structure due to open in April - and other donors are financing construction
of the road to China.
Even the building work is a novelty in a country where 85 per cent of the
population depend on subsistence agriculture and have to forage for food in
the forests if their crops are damaged by drought.
Abandoned by the disintegrating Soviet Union in the 1980s, Laos's socialist
rulers (they have forsaken the communist label and dropped the hammer and
sickle from the flag) have encouraged foreign investment as well as foreign
aid. The 'New Economic Mechanism' is the Lao code phrase for capitalism.
As in Laos's long-time ally Vietnam, the ruling party is in an ideological
vacuum. Officially, the government of Mr Khamtay Siphandon says that the
one-party system will stay for ever. State radio blares out the officially
approved news from street corners.
The increasingly prosperous inhabitants of Vientiane, however, watch Thai
television broadcasts (Thai and Lao languages are similar) or programmes
beamed by satellite from Star TV in Hong Kong. They want to learn English
and they go to discotheques.
The government is concerned about the social, environmental and political
dangers of foreign - especially Thai - influence and economic
liberalisation. It has therefore moved cautiously, but it has moved
nonetheless.
Moribund state companies are being privatised or closed. Sensing that the
inaccessibility of Laos and its small population make it a relatively
unattractive prospect for investors, the government has gone further than
its neighbours and allowed 100 per cent foreign ownership of companies.
Clothing produced in more than 50 new factories has overtaken
hydroelectricity as the country's main export, although there are plans for
foreign investors to build hundreds of millions of dollars worth of new
dams, increase electricity output 10-fold and sell 1,500MW to Thailand by
the end of the decade.
Timber processing is also thriving. Hunt Oil and Enterprise Oil are
searching for oil and gas. Newmont of the US and CRA Exploration of
Australia are looking for gold. Shinawatra of Thailand has won a Dollars 63m
contract to install telephone networks and a satellite earth station.
Tourism is increasing. Some former refugees, Lao-Americans and
Lao-Australians, are returning as investors.
Foreign investment, much of it from other Asian countries such as Taiwan,
Singapore and Thailand, is still pouring in at a rate of some Dollars 150m a
year, and the economy is growing rapidly: 7 per cent in 1992 and about the
same again in 1993. In these two important respects, the statistics show
that Laos is a poor country in south-east Asia rather than a poor country in
Africa.

FT  20 JAN 94 / Bentsen warns China over its MFN status
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US Treasury secretary, said yesterday China had not made
sufficient progress on human rights to warrant US renewal of its Most
Favoured Nation trading status, but he indicated that Washington was
nevertheless anxious to forge closer economic ties with Beijing.
Mr Bentsen is the most senior representative of the Clinton administration
to visit China. His presence in the Chinese capital is clearly designed to
be part of a new US thrust to improve working relations dogged by bickering
over human rights and arms disputes.
'It's really time to re-engage China on economic issues. We need to help
China reform. We need a forum to address our bilateral concerns,' Mr Bentsen
told reporters after meeting Prime Minister Li Peng.
Describing the human rights issue as 'basic to our relationship,' the US
official said 'there has been progress, but so far it hasn't gone far
enough'.
President Clinton is obliged by mid-year to rule on whether China has made
sufficient improvements in its human rights behaviour to justify MFN
renewal. Mr Clinton said last year that China would need to make
'significant progress'.
Mr Bentsen's visit to China follows a review of US-China policy and comes
after the meeting last November between Mr Clinton and Chinese President
Jiang Zemin in Seattle at an Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) forum
summit.
The Treasury secretary, who will co-chair a bilateral economic forum
tomorrow, said that among his objectives in Beijing was to persuade China of
the need to continue opening its markets, and also to demonstrate support
for economic reforms.
The two countries are reviving a joint economic committee which last met in
1987 to pursue issues of mutual concern. Washington has been pressing the
Chinese on questions such as abuse of intellectual property rights,
especially the pirating of compact discs.
Mr Bentsen is also likely to express concern about a widening trade gap.
Chinese exports to the US last year exceeded imports by Dollars 25bn (Pounds
16.7bn), prompting protests from Congress leaders. China's trade surplus
with the US is exceeded only by Japan's.
Mr Bentsen's visit came just two days after the US and China signed a
three-year textile agreement, averting a serious trade dispute. The US
threatened to slash Chinese textile imports, but in the end agreed to an
effective freeze at present levels.

FT  20 JAN 94 / 'Foreign investment' fuelled China boom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL, Asia Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
China said yesterday that its boom had been fuelled by a record Dollars 27bn
(Pounds 18bn) of foreign investment last year and that it was confident
measures to slow the economic growth rate were proving effective.
The investment total made China 'the country attracting the largest sum of
foreign capital in a single year,' said Mr Chen Yuan, deputy governor of the
People's Bank of China, the central bank.
He gave no breakdown of the figure, which compared with an inflow of Dollars
11bn in 1992, itself more than double the total of 1991.
Mr Chen said steps taken last year, including higher interest rates and
curbs on bank lending to finance real estate speculation, had been intended
to produce 'structural adjustment, not an across-the-board retrenchment.
'We aimed at a 'soft landing.' We think we are getting there,' Mr Chen said
in a speech delivered by Mr Ma Yuzhen, China's ambassador to Britain, to a
London conference organised by Thornton, the fund management group. Mr Chen
was detained by meetings in Beijing.
He was unusually candid about the debate in Beijing over the need to slow
growth, admitting that 'there are still dissenting views on whether we
prescribed the right medication, at the right time, with the right dosage.'
Business people and high growth regions of China felt the measures were too
harsh, while 'the IMF people and World Bank people warned of the dangerous
and unpleasant consequences of not being firm against inflation or other
maladies of the economy,' Mr Chen said.
Mr Zhu Rongji, vice-premier in charge of the economy and central bank
governor, indicated that moves to restore financial order would be
maintained. Problems such as over-investment in fixed assets and rapid money
supply growth 'had not been basically solved,' he said on state television
yesterday. 'The pressure for inflation could rise at any time.'
China is aiming to slow the economy to a 9 per cent growth rate in 1994 from
13 per cent rates in each of 1992 and 1993, and to cut inflation to about 12
per cent from about 17 per cent. Mr Chen said, however, that the slowing
measures were only intended as a 'stop-gap' while China tackled the 'root
cause' of its problems, which he described as the slow pace of reform of
state enterprises and of the means of macro-economic control.
'Controlling economic growth rates is easy, we have done that before more
than once, but we cannot solve the underlying problem and bring economic
development on to a rapid, sustainable and healthy course without tackling
the root cause,' he said.
Under way were reorganisation of the corporate system into limited liability
companies, with amalgamations encouraged and unworkable enterprises allowed
to go bankrupt. Banking, tax, financial market and currency reforms were
also in progress.
Under new tax reforms, enterprise taxes were unified at 33 per cent,
personal income tax rates were also unified, and VAT introduced. The
treasury in Beijing would receive tariffs, consumption taxes and state
enterprise income taxes, while local governments would receive business and
local enterprise taxes, personal income taxes and land taxes.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Indian share prices fell yesterday after income tax inspectors announced the
extension of a long-running probe into the affairs of Mr Harshad Mehta, the
stockbroker at the centre of the 1992 securities market scandal.
The Bombay Stock Exchange index fell 125.11 points to 3,825.91 amid reports
of panic selling of blocks of shares which investors feared might become
subject to the investigation. Stockbrokers said that the market had in any
case been ripe for a fall after a 54 per cent rise since early November
prompted by large-scale foreign buying.
The income tax inspectors' investigation began in 1992 after Mr Mehta was
arrested for his alleged involvement in the Rs42bn (Pounds 900m) scandal
which rocked the Bombay securities market. Mr Mehta and others were accused
of trading illegally in the inter-bank securities market in order to siphon
funds into the stock market.
Last October, trading was disrupted when it emerged the tax authorities had
frozen dealings in blocks of stock which they said were being held by others
on Mr Mehta's behalf.
The authorities then specified blocks of shares in nine leading companies
held by 134 individuals and companies. Yesterday they added shares of a
further 20 companies held by 608 individuals and companies.

FT  20 JAN 94 / Nigerian central bank probe ordered
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Nigeria's military ruler General Sani Abacha yesterday established a panel
to investigate the central bank and told it to find out whether the
institution was to blame for the country's economic woes.
'It has. . . become necessary to find out whether the Central Bank of
Nigeria (CBN) has been a culprit or a victim in the unfortunate sequences
that have culminated in our present economic troubles,' Gen Abacha said.
The establishment of the seven-member panel of inquiry led by an economist,
Mr Pius Okigbo, comes after the government last week unveiled the 1994
budget which placed greater responsibility on the CBN for the management of
Nigeria's scarce foreign exchange.
Many financial analysts doubt whether the central bank has the capacity to
implement and police the policies effectively.
