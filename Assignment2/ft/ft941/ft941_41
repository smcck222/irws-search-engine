FT  20 JAN 94 / World Trade News: EU leaves banana offer on the table
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission said yesterday that its offer of greater access to
the banana market in the European Union for Latin American producers
remained on the table until February 15 in spite of a damning report by a
Gatt panel.
The Commission was divided on the issue with Mr Rene Steichen, agriculture
commissioner, pushing to keep the offer open while Sir Leon Brittan, trade
commissioner, wanted to withdraw. Keeping the offer open would contradict
earlier threats made in a letter from Mr Steichen and Sir Leon that the
offer would be withdrawn if Latin American producers continued with their
Gatt complaint.
Some European countries appeared unhappy with the Commission's apparent
about-turn. In addition, Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, is
reported to be protesting to the Commission over strong-arm tactics used in
encouraging Latin American producers to agree to the new banana deal.
Latin American countries finally decided late on Tuesday to reject the EU's
offer of greater access to the banana market after support from Costa Rica
crumbled.
The latest offer by the EU to eight Latin American producers would allow
them to export 2.1m tonnes of bananas to the EU this year as opposed to 2m
tonnes last year.
It would also increase quota allocations for the Latin Americans, chiefly
benefiting Costa Rica which would see its share of the 2.1m tonne access
rise to 23.4 per cent from 19 per cent in 1992.
A group of five Latin American countries have complained to Gatt about the
EU's banana regime which favours African, Caribbean and Pacific producers. A
first panel report by Gatt was released to complainants on Tuesday.
The report found that the EU's banana arrangements are inconsistent with
Gatt rules: in particular the 20 per cent tariffs charged, discrimination
between producers such as those from Latin American countries and ACP
countries and the licensing regime. The report is unlikely to be adopted but
it puts EU countries in a difficult position. Some member states are
pressing for changes to the banana regime.

FT  20 JAN 94 / World Trade News: Japanese drug production falls

<TEXT>
Japanese domestic pharmaceuticals production registered its first fall in
seven years during 1992, according to the latest data published by the Japan
Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association. The trade body blamed government
imposed price cuts and distribution system reforms for the 2.2 per cent fall
to Y5,574bn (Pounds 33.3bn).
The growing strength of overseas groups in Japan and the continuing
international weakness of Japanese companies helped the country register the
world's largest trade deficit in medicines during 1992, worth Y246.8bn.
Exports increased 15.5 per cent to Y183.3bn.
The largest export market was the US, worth Y41bn, followed by Germany
(Y17.9bn), Belgium (Y15bn), China (Y14bn), France (Y13bn), South Korea
(Y11bn), and Italy (Y10.7bn).
Only four Japanese companies generated more than 10 per cent of their sales
overseas during the year to March 1993. These were Yamanouchi (29 per cent),
Fujisawa (24.5 per cent), Tanabe (17.7 per cent) and Takeda (10.2 per cent).
Imports rose 4.3 per cent to Y430bn. Germany was the largest importer
generating sales of Y106bn, followed by the US (Y80bn), the UK (Y48bn),
Switzerland (Y46bn) and Sweden (Y26bn).
Japanese drugs groups have also been investing heavily in research and
development during recent years with the aim of creating world-class
medicines. In 1992 they spent Y590bn on R&amp;D, an increase of 14.3 per cent on
the previous year. Smaller companies accounted for most of the rise. Ten
years ago Japanese groups invested only Y239bn on R&amp;D.

FT  20 JAN 94 / World Trade News: Driven to 'think global and act local' / A
look at Mercedes-Benz's commercial vehicle strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mercedes-Benz was investing in the North American Free Trade Area before the
company knew whether talks between the US, Canada and Mexico would succeed,
according to Mr Bernd Gottschalk, head of the company's commercial vehicles
division.
Whether it was accident or design which led to the late-1980s purchase of
Freightliner trucks in the US and the opening of Mexican capacity now making
12,000 buses and trucks a year, he does not say. But Nafta has encouraged a
strategy towards positioning the company to take advantage of what he calls
'market conglomerates' or regional market groupings which have yet to come
into being.
He is already preparing for Mercosur, the proposed common market comprising
Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay and he has posted watch on the Asia
Pacific Economic Co-operation group. If the world is to evolve into clusters
of trading neighbours, Mercedes-Benz intends to be prepared.
The company started preparing early for the arrival of Mercosur, laying
plans to restructure its Latin American manufacturing and at the same time
breaking into the regional market for vans. The task began last year with
exports of vans from Spain to Argentina and Brazil.
Meanwhile, capacity is being prepared in Argentina for the construction,
starting in 1996, of a new van, the T1N, which is due to start production
shortly in Dusseldorf. Of the 15,000 start-up production, Mr Gottschalk
expects most will be shipped into Brazil. 'Our Argentine factories will in
future concentrate on vans and gearboxes while buses and trucks will come
from Brazil.'
Driven to globalisation by high export costs and widely different market
needs, Mercedes commercial vehicles is already one of the most international
of the Daimler-Benz group's manufacturing businesses. As Mr Gottschalk says,
DM10bn of his DM25bn (Pounds 9.7bn) annual turnover stems from production
sites outside Europe.
While the Mercosur arrangements represent a refinement of an established
global investment policy, there is more foreign spending to come.
In Europe, where Mercedes claims 30 per cent of the market for trucks over 6
tonnes and up to 12 per cent of van sales, Mr Gottschalk points out that
future growth is strictly governed by expected economic expansion of 2 or 3
per cent a year.
In China, he notes, Mercedes has 0.1 per cent of a market likely to expand
by 8 to 10 per cent a year. In south-east Asia and other developing regions,
market shares fluctuate between 0.5 and 1 per cent.
'We need new ways to enter these markets,' he says. Opening capacity, based
on the 'think global, act local' tenet, developed by his predecessor Mr
Helmut Werner, is part of the answer. 'We have to enlarge the philosophy.'
This process, entailing knitting together the group's products and
production sites into a global logistical network, has already started.
Buses currently produced with a Beijing partner are built on a chassis from
Mercedes do Brasil. New capacity planned for Shanghai will build a bus based
on a current Turkish model.
But the concept will be fully tested this summer at the company's Indonesian
subsidiary, PT. GMM, selected to pilot production of a new light 'component'
truck, the MB 700. Co-ordinated through a new regional logistics centre in
Singapore; engines will be shipped in from Brazil, axles and drive trains
will come from India. Japan will supply power steering and body parts will
arrive from Spain.
The truck will also provide supplies for Thailand and Taiwan. Mr Gottschalk
also foresees the model coming closer to home. Turkey, he says, is an ideal
production platform for central Asia.
But he is reluctant to discuss prospects for building 'component' trucks
within Germany, an idea which would spell the end of many more domestic
jobs. He admits that with around 50 per cent of all parts made within
domestic factories 'we do a lot more than we should.' His short-term target
is to reduce vertical integration to 45 per cent. 'To go further than that
we would need to change our whole production structure,' he adds.
'We are trying to be more international than any of our competitors. This is
a new concept for the company. It requires new motivation, and we are in the
process of convincing our German workforce,' he says. 'I never believed in
the world car, and the world truck is a myth.'

FT  20 JAN 94 / World Trade News: Unctad report urges market regulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, the main UN forum on
development issues, is urging developing countries to improve the regulation
and efficiency of domestic stock markets so as to tap the huge flows of
foreign capital seeking high returns in emerging markets.
This represents a big switch of policy for Unctad, which has in the past
favoured loan finance from governments and banks for third world
industrialisation.
It reflects growing signs that foreign portfolio equity investment (FPEI) is
becoming an increasingly important source of external finance for developing
countries, and one that appears to be sustainable in the long term.
In a report, Unctad notes that as a percentage of total long-term net
resource flows FPEI has risen from 4 per cent in 1989 to 9 per cent in 1992.
World Bank figures, which are on the conservative side, show that gross FPEI
flows to developing nations rose from Dollars 3.5bn in 1989 to Dollars 13bn
in 1992, before slipping to Dollars 11bn (Pounds 7.4bn) in 1993. FPEI is a
welcome source of external finance, especially since it is not
debt-creating, Unctad says.
Global investors have tended to take a long-term view and foreign equity
flows have not shown large fluctuations. However, the report admits that
FPEI tends to increase market volatility, which is an argument for opening
domestic markets gradually.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US farmers are pressing the Clinton administration to impose emergency curbs
on the flood of cheap Canadian wheat imports now entering the US.
With many grain elevators bulging with Canadian wheat, US farmers have begun
to take action. In Montana recently, farmers blockaded delivery of Canadian
wheat to a grain elevator with parked trucks.
'We never had wheat coming across before the flawed free trade agreement
with Canada,' said a spokesman for the US Wheat Associates. 'You wouldn't
expect it to come across at cheaper than US prices.'
US and Canadian negotiators have been trying to reach an agreement on
disputes in five farm sectors: wheat, peanut butter, sugar and sugar
products, poultry and dairy. Mr Ralph Goodale, Canada's agriculture
minister, said it was possible that agreement could be reached this week.
Meanwhile, President Clinton has asked the US International Trade Commission
to investigate the wheat imports.

FT  20 JAN 94 / French recovery hits bumpy patch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The uneven nature of France's economic recovery was yesterday underlined by
industrial production figures, released by Insee, the official statistics
agency. In November last year industrial production rose by 0.6 per cent
over its level in October following a month-on-month drop of 0.7 per cent.
Despite see-sawing and conflicting indications of an economic upturn, the
government is adhering to its forecast of 1.4 per cent growth for this year,
while busily reviewing its options if the economy looks like falling far
short of this.
Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister, yesterday said the credibility
of the government's forecast had been reinforced by a Bank of France survey
of industrialists in December who 'confirmed the improvement in industrial
production detected in November'.
Insee is predicting that output in the fourth quarter of 1994 will show a
0.3 per cent rise over the third quarter. The agency forecasts an average
0.4 per cent output rise in the first two quarters of this year.
After Prime Minister Edouard Balladur discussed the situation with three of
his economic ministers yesterday, Mr Nicolas Sarkozy, the budget minister
and official government spokesman, said 'encouraging prospects' had been
identified, and that no new measures would be announced before a special
February 3 ministerial seminar. Mr Balladur is to hold similar discussions
on health insurance reform today and on unemployment next week.
This flurry of meetings is prompted partly by Mr Balladur's desire to regain
political momentum after last week's setback to his education reform, and
partly out of genuine uncertainty about the economy and worry over rising
unemployment.

US officials were yesterday putting a brave face on the emerging policies of
Russian President Boris Yeltsin, but admitting surprise that President Bill
Clinton's apparent successes in Moscow last week should have been so quickly
called into question.
The resignation of Mr Yegor Gaidar from the Russian government has been seen
as contradicting the whole tone of the Moscow summit, during which Mr
Clinton emphasised the need to press ahead with economic reform.
US officials are now pinning their hopes to the prospect of Mr Boris
Fyodorov, the finance minister and another economic reformer, staying in the
Russian government.
Such concerns over the pace of economic reform have been accompanied by
rising anxiety over the continued presence of Russian troops in the Baltic
states of Latvia and Estonia.
Clinton administration officials were this week taken aback by the
suggestion by Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the foreign minister, that it would be
dangerous for Russia to withdraw all its troops from the territories of the
former Soviet Union. Mr Clinton had pressed Mr Yeltsin at the Moscow summit
for a swift withdrawal of troops from Estonia and Latvia, and believed he
had received assurances from Mr Yeltsin that this would happen.
Mr Michael McCurry, a State Department spokesman, said that Mr Kozyrev's
comments were 'certainly at odds with statements signed by President Yeltsin
in Moscow'.
'We have told the Russian government repeatedly that we expect prompt
withdrawal of all Russian troops from Estonia and Latvia,' he said.

FT  20 JAN 94 / Bosnia partition talks collapse

   GENEVA, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Talks among Bosnia's three warring parties last night collapsed, with the
Bosnian government under increased pressure to endorse a deal after Croatia
and Serb-led Yugoslavia agreed to establish low-level diplomatic relations.
Lord Owen, the European Union mediator, said the warring communities would
go back to 'fight with no real prospects of coming together in a
constructive frame of getting a peace agreement'.
He said agreement on partition remained deadlocked on the same points -
demands for the restoration of a string of towns throughout Bosnia, which
were mostly Moslem before the outbreak of war.
Under the modest accord, signed by the foreign ministers of Croatia and
Yugoslavia, the two countries will set up representative offices in their
respective capitals by February 15. While proclaiming the declaration 'a
major step towards the normalisation of relations between Croatia and
Serbia', Mr Franjo Tudjman, the Croatian president, was disappointed by the
refusal of Mr Slobodan Milosevic, his Serbian counterpart, to extend full
diplomatic recognition of Croatia within its borders.
The agreement failed to address the most serious point of contention, the
fact that Serbs have set up their own state, of Krajina, on a third of
Croatian territory. The Krajina Serbs yesterday said Croatia could sign
international agreements 'only for the territory that it controls'.
Diplomats said the restoration of communication and transport links would be
top priority. However, similar agreements put forward since 1991 have
collapsed.
Mr Mohamed Sacirbey, Bosnia's ambassador to the UN, expressed the Moslem-led
government's fear of a Serbo-Croat carve-up at their expense. 'We hope this
does not signal a further alliance of war against our country,' he said,
adding that Croats should decide 'whether they are victims in this war or
whether they are opportunistic aggressors'.
Mr Alija Izetbegovic, the Bosnian president, said there had been no progress
in yesterday's talks. He stuck to his demands for the return of territory in
eastern and western Bosnia seized by Serb forces over 22 months of war.
In sessions, Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, the UN mediator,
discussed the creation of an international arbitration commission to settle
territorial disputes. But Lord Owen said the Moslems had rejected such a
proposal which would effectively sanction the military status quo until the
commission determined which ethnic community should control a contested
town.
France was yesterday considering a successor to General Jean Cot, who is to
relinquish his command of United Nations forces in ex-Yugoslavia at the
request of Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, by March 31,
writes David Buchan in Paris. As the largest provider of UN troops in the
former Yugoslavia, it is for France to propose a replacement.

FT  20 JAN 94 / Political uncertainty leaves the rouble without a prop:
Rouble set for further falls - Brussels thinks again on aide / Anxiety over
Baltic states - US expresses surprise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
A dam has burst for the rouble, with its fall from 1,200 to 1,607 against
the dollar in less than three weeks.
The pressure had been building for months, thanks to the widening
differential between the Russian inflation rate, of between 12 and 20 per
cent a month in the second half of last year, and the stability of the
Russian currency against the dollar.
But what broke the wall was the political crisis caused by the refusal of Mr
Yegor Gaidar and Mr Boris Fyodorov, the most prominent reformers in the
outgoing cabinet, to serve in the next one.
According to some reports yesterday, Mr Fyodorov might after all be prepared
to serve as finance minister in the new cabinet. Until his position
clarifies, the pressure on the rouble and the Russian financial system is
likely to continue.
The banks are now very jittery about the future for economic reform - it was
their movement out of roubles and into more stable currencies on the
inter-bank market that triggered the rouble's most recent slide. The
government will need to deliver a far more coherent economic policy to
regain the confidence of its financial institutions. Nor will the structural
need for a realignment in the currency, thanks to high inflation, be easily
addressed.
Yesterday, Moscow's heavily barred exchange points were surrounded by small
crowds, with wads of roubles in their handbags and pockets.
Just off Pushkin Square, outside an exchange that had run out of money, a
cashier was screaming at the queue, who were screaming at her. In the lobby
of the upmarket Slavyanskaya Hotel, where President Bill Clinton stayed last
week, the branch of Dialog Bank had also run out of hard currency.
By the end of the afternoon, most points in the centres appeared to be
closed - with signs advertising the fact that they had run out of dollars,
an implicit recognition that no one wanted to buy roubles.
Most analysts were not yesterday predicting a complete collapse of the
currency. There is still demand for roubles - the more so because cash
transactions, from January 1, cannot be in dollars. Wages must be paid,
purchases made, and for many, the dollar is still unfamiliar, even if
stable.
'This has been coming for some time,' said one analyst. 'Sooner or later the
difference between the growing inflation rate and the dollar rate would have
had to work through, and the political crisis made it sooner'. This analyst
had worked out that, had the rouble devalued parallel with inflation, it
would now be trading at around 3,500 to the dollar - though he did not
expect it to sink so low.
It is possible a full-scale panic could now emerge: the central bank, which
intervened yesterday and the day before to limit the fall to around 100
roubles, could allow the rouble to sink, or be unable to stop it though
intervention. The crowds changing money are not vast, but they are
significant and could grow.
Whatever the outcome of the current political crisis, the structural
pressure on the rouble is likely to remain for some time. Inflation is now
thought to be very high - as high, according to the daily Sevodnya, as it
was at the beginning of 1992, when a raft of prices were suddenly
liberalised. Even as the triumph of last December, when it was brought down
to the level of 12 per cent a month, was being trumpeted, prices zipped up
in the week between December 27 and January 3, by at least 7 per cent.
Prices are now on course to end the month more than 30 per cent higher than
a month earlier.
Spending decisions just before, and very soon after, the December 12
elections could exacerbate the situation. Those made before included
assistance to the coal industry and to agriculture, as well as increases to
pensions and the minimum wage. Those made after include the payment of part
of the Rbs6,000-7,000bn in unpaid wages and other government commitments,
slashed by Mr Fyodorov in the last quarter of last year and now up for
payment.
There have also been one-off spending commitments, such as the refurbishment
of the shelled White House (set to cost Dollars 70m); to the new
parliamentary centre (at around Dollars 500m) and the as yet unknown cost of
the coming agreement on economic union between Belarus and Russia.
Moscow's bankers, lacking hard currency, are beginning to worry that they
may not survive the crisis. Mr Alexei Obozintsev, deputy head of Tokobank,
said yesterday: 'Yeltsin is the only hope left, he's the only reformer we
have. He must act now.'
However, the classic reaction of a central bank to such a crisis - higher
interest rates - has not been announced and is not foreshadowed.

FT  20 JAN 94 / Brussels shies away from big aid packages
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission yesterday signalled that it was re-examining how
best to keep alive prospects for economic and political reform in Russia.
Officials said that Brussels was leaning toward more aid for training and
other micro-economic measures aimed at encouraging private enterprise in
Russia, rather than multi-billion dollar macro-economic stabilisation
packages co-ordinated by the International Monetary Fund.
This reflects growing sentiment that the EU should focus more on practical
measures at municipal and regional level, especially now the hand of the
economic reformers in Moscow appears to be weakened.
Sir Leon Brittan, chief EU trade negotiator, outlined the new thinking in
talks three days ago in Brussels with Mr Ivan Silayev, the Russian
ambassador to the European Union.
'He told the ambassador that we only support President Yeltsin because he is
a reformer, not because we simply want to support Yeltsin,' said one
official.
Between 1990 and 1993, the EU contributed almost three-quarters of world aid
 -Ecu52.4bn (Pounds 41.23bn) - to Russia and the newly independent former
Soviet republics, much more than the US and Japan. The Commission itself
supplied Ecu3.5 bn, largely through specially targeted aid programmes.
Mr Henning Christophersen, economics commissioner, said this week that
western aid to Russia should be broadened. 'We should not forget how
important it is for the reform programme to get the private sector to work
in a more efficient way.'
In a speech last Friday, Sir Leon called for aid efforts to include more
social programmes and spending on infrastructure so that the average Russian
citizen recognised his stake in economic reform.
The new focus may provoke misgivings in the Clinton administration which -
after some hesitation - has reaffirmed its faith in centrally-guided reforms
based on lowering inflation and the budget deficit. President Clinton's
message in his recent trip to Moscow was 'more reform in Russia and more
money'.
Negotiations between Moscow and Brussels have been stalled since the
political and economic power struggle. Brussels officials are braced for an
even tougher Russian stance, even though the outstanding obstacles are
relatively few - notably, access to the Russian banking sector and the rules
governing the trade of uranium between the EU and Russia.

FT  20 JAN 94 / Moscow backpedals in row over Baltic troops
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Russian Foreign Ministry yesterday assured western diplomats that
remarks by Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, that Russian
troops would stay in the Baltics had been reported out of context.
However, doubts remain about Mr Kozyrev's - and the Russian government's -
intentions. 'This was clearly meant to be some sort of signal,' said a
senior western diplomat yesterday. 'But it's not clear what, since the
signals vary depending on the part of the government they come from.'
Mr Kozyrev, who addressed ambassadors and senior officials of the foreign,
defence and interior ministries on Tuesday, had been quoted as saying that
Russian troops should remain in the former Soviet republics, including the
Baltic states, to avoid a security vacuum and to protect Russian speakers in
these states.
Reports of his remarks caused protests from the Baltic states.
Lithuania said it was strange that such a speech was made immediately after
the meeting of the presidents of the US and Russia and at the time when the
new Russian parliament opened. Presidents Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton
signed an understanding on the Baltics, which included a Russian commitment
to complete troop withdrawals.
Mr Georgy Karasin, the foreign office's chief spokesman, told the Interfax
news agency yesterday that he had been using the words 'presence' and
'withdrawal' (of troops) in the 'broadest possible sense'.
However, western diplomats believe that the permission to the agencies to
report the speech, and the harsher tone taken towards the Baltics, sends a
signal to these states and to the world that the attitude continues to
harden - especially since the Yeltsin administration sees a need to steal
some of the thunder from the patriotic right in parliament.

FT  20 JAN 94 / Croats and Serbs form new ties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Croatia and Serb-led Yugoslavia yesterday agreed to establish low-level
diplomatic relations, stepping up pressure on the Bosnian government to
endorse a deal on the republic's partition.
Under the modest accord, signed by the foreign ministers of Croatia and
Yugoslavia, the two countries will set up representative offices in their
respective capitals by February 15. While proclaiming the declaration 'a
major step towards the normalisation of relations between Croatia and
Serbia', Mr Franjo Tudjman, the Croatian president, was disappointed by the
refusal of Mr Slobodan Milosevic, his Serbian counterpart, to extend full
diplomatic recognition of Croatia within its borders.
The agreement failed to address the most serious point of contention, the
fact that Serbs have set up their own state which occupies one-third of
Croatian territory.
Diplomats said the restoration of communication and transport links would be
top priority. However, similar agreements put forward since 1991 have
collapsed.
Mr Mohamed Sacirbey, Bosnia's ambassador to the United Nations, expressed
the Moslem-led government's fear of a Serbo-Croat carve-up at their expense.
.'We hope this does not signal a further alliance of war against our
country,' he said, adding that Croats should decide 'whether they are
victims in this war or whether they are opportunistic aggressors'.
Meanwhile, talks among the three warring parties on the division of Bosnia
remained deadlocked as Mr Alija Izetbegovic, the Bosnian president, stuck to
demands for the return of territory in eastern and western Bosnia, seized by
Serb forces over 22 months of war.
In other sessions, Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, international
mediators, discussed the creation of an international arbitration commission
to settle territorial disputes, such as Zvornik and Visegrad, Serb-held
towns in eastern Bosnia where Moslems used to comprise the majority.
In a surprise move the Bosnian spokesman yesterday announced that Mr
Izetbegovic would back the arbitration proposal. It would effectively
sanction the military status quo until the commission determined which
ethnic community should control a contested town.
Serb leaders did not immediately comment on the proposal, which could win
their endorsement even though they have opposed international involvement in
the past.
The French government was yesterday considering a successor to General Jean
Cot, who is to relinquish his command of United Nations forces in
ex-Yugoslavia at the request of Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN
secretary-general, by March 31, writes David Buchan in Paris.
As the largest provider of UN troops in the former Yugoslavia, it is for
France to propose replacing General Cot with another French general -
rumoured to be General Bertrand de Lapresle.

FT  20 JAN 94 / Hurd seeks to deepen ties between Turkey and EU
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ANKARA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Douglas Hurd, Britain's foreign secretary, yesterday promised an
initiative to deepen ties between Turkey and Europe, in a move which Greece
promptly attacked as in breach of European Union foreign and security
policy.
Mr Hurd, who arrived in Ankara yesterday, was due to deliver a speech on
Europe and Turkey, ahead of talks today with both his Turkish counterpart,
and Mr Klaus Kinkel, the German foreign minister.
With the Germans joining the talks, Turkey has an opportunity to air
concerns about being isolated in the process of European integration, a
discussion which has often been difficult to hold in the EU because of the
Greek veto. The Anglo-German initiative is the first joint action to
co-operate in areas of common concern.
Turkey, a Nato member, has had an agreement of association with the EU since
1963 and applied for full membership in 1987 but was rejected in 1989.
Relations have since been strained over concern on human rights, Cyprus and
Greece's use of its veto as an EU member to block financial support for
Turkey.
Mr Hurd's visit coincides with the start of the six-month presidency of the
EU by Greece, Turkey's long-time rival. In Athens a Greek government
spokesman said the meeting breached the foreign and security policy outlined
by the Twelve at the Maastricht summit in 1992.
In the unlikely prospect of an early decision on Ankara's application for
full EU membership, the UK is seeking new ways to cement Turkey's relations
with Europe. Ankara fears losing ground to applicants from Efta and former
communist states of east Europe.
In talks yesterday with his opposite number, Mr Hikmet Cetin, and separately
with Prime Minister Tansu Ciller, Mr Hurd touched on a range of topics from
Cyprus, Turkish worries about Russian intentions in the Caucasus, to Turkish
concerns over Moslems in Bosnia. 'Turkey should continue to be fully
involved in the evolving arrangements for European defence,' Mr Hurd said
last night, in a clear attempt to ease Turkish concern at the offer of
associate, rather than full, membership of the Western European Union
defence organisation.

FT  20 JAN 94 / Enel chief faces power station fraud charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Franco Viezzoli, the head of Enel, Italy's electricity authority, was
yesterday arrested on charges of alleged serious fraud, abuse of office and
manipulation of bids relating to the construction of a power station at
Gioia Tauro in southern Calabria.
He was arrested with 10 members of Enel in a police operation relating to
the alleged rigging of bids for the power plant and the involvement of the
'ndrangheta, the Calabrian mafia. Among the Enel executives were Mr Guido
Gallizioli, the deputy director, as well as Mr Alberto Negroni, former
managing director.
A total of 39 arrest warrants were issued covering local and national
contractors, including Mr Lorenzo Panzavolta, the former head of
Calcestruzzi, the Ferruzzi group's construction arm. Those arrested include
those suspected of operating front companies for the leading local mafia
families, the Piromalli and Pesce.
Since 1989 magistrates in Calabria have been investigating the construction
of Enel's power plant at Gioia Tauro, the site of an unbuilt steel complex.
In 1990 work was stopped because contractors were suspected to have been
infiltrated by the local mafia. Enel sought to restart the project and the
go-ahead with new guidelines was given last November.
Enel said yesterday it hoped the matter would be clarified as soon as
possible.
As a result of magistrates' investigations into bribes and illicit payments
to contractors, evidence has emerged of alleged corruption in at least two
Enel power station contracts - Brindisi in the south and Montalto near Rome.
But this is the first time executives have been charged.
In a separate development, Ravenna magistrates have decided to broaden the
charges against the Ferruzzi family and former managers of the group to
include conspiracy to commit a crime. This is the same charge as that
levelled against criminal organisations and it is the first time magistrates
have directed it against those running an industrial concern.
Those affected include Mr Arturo Ferruzzi, the former chairman, Ms
Alessandra Ferruzzi, his sister and wife of Mr Carlo Sama, former head of
Ferruzzi's main industrial arm, Montedison, who was also indicted with the
new charge; Mr Giuseppe Garofano, former chairman of Montedison; Mr Giuseppe
Berlini, the Swiss-based head of the Ferruzzi family's overseas operations,
and Mr Sergio Cragnotti, the former right-hand man of the late Raul Gardini
while he was running the Ferruzzi family's business.
It is not clear how this will affect Milan magistrates' well-advanced
investigation into the Ferruzzi-Montedison group.

FT  20 JAN 94 / BA protest over aid for Air France
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Airways yesterday launched a vigorous attack on Air France, urging
the European Commission to force the French state-owned flag carrier to
repay a FFr1.5bn (Pounds 170m) capital injection, saying it constituted a
subsidy in contravention of the Treaty of Rome.
The UK airline's attack comes as an EU commission is due to recommend a
policy on state aid to ailing European national airlines, many of which are
seeking support from their governments.
Both BA and the UK government have campaigned against additional state aid
to financially troubled European state carriers which they argue are
severely distorting the European airline market.
BA's objection to the Air France refinancing package before the EU follows
Brussels' approval for earlier government injections to Air France of
FFr5.84bn in 1991 and 1992.
The privatised UK carrier is worried that the French government will soon
seek approval for further aid to Air France, totalling more than FFr5bn as
part of the latest rescue package for the troubled French carrier.
Air France last night rejected BA's claims and insisted that the FFr1.5bn
injection involved convertible bonds and other paper issued under normal
market conditions. It also stated that the earlier FFr5.84bn it had received
involved FFr2bn in a government capital injection approved by the EU as not
consisting of a state subsidy, with the remainder raised on the French
financial market.
Mr David Holmes, BA's head of government and industry affairs, said the
FFr1.5bn aid 'was not a commercial investment'.

FT  20 JAN 94 / Impolite in the pub but fine on the train
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With an estimated one in 20 people now in possession of a mobile telephone,
the network operator Cellnet yesterday attempted to address the urge felt by
the remaining 19 to place the nearest mobile, if not its user, under the
wheel of a passing bus.
Mobile telephone etiquette, Cellnet recognises, is an underdeveloped field.
In a booklet entitled Mobile Manners, Cellnet says: 'Many of the nuances of
contemporary politeness - eating peas off the back of a fork, sending thank
you notes, not smoking while eating - are steeped in a long tradition. The
owner of a mobile phone who wishes to use it considerately and thoughtfully
will be negotiating relatively uncharted territory.'
Do not, Cellnet advises its customers, stop in the middle of the pavement to
speak on your mobile. Switch off your telephone while at the theatre.
Cellnet believes the rudeness of mobile users has been exaggerated. 'How
many people can honestly admit to having heard a mobile phone go off in a
restaurant?' Probably about 19 out of 20.
But Cellnet, clearly with an eye to ensuring its customers remain in
sufficiently good health to pay their bills, does have definite views about
receiving calls in a pub. 'Best to switch off,' it says.
So much for etiquette. The rest of the guide peddles the advantages of the
mobile, as well as encouraging behaviour calculated to incite the squirting
of Superglue on telephone earpieces.
Persuading train travellers to retire to the connecting space between
carriages before using their mobiles would have been a substantial
contribution to the new etiquette.
Instead, Cellnet trills: 'On British Rail, the mobile phone is accepted as
the ubiquitous business accessory. As the train cruises effortlessly through
the countryside, receivers chirrup gently, business people thrash out sales
figures with those back in the office, examine financial projections and
verbally re-run the previous night's inter-departmental football match.'
And ignore fellow shoppers' glares as you phone home from the checkout queue
to make sure you have remembered everything. 'They're waiting for the
cashier to give them a 10 pence piece in their change so they can join the
queue for a payphone.'

Firebombs ignited in two stores in Co Londonderry last night. Earlier, six

attacks were thought to be the work of the IRA.

FT  20 JAN 94 / Russian economy's prospects hinge on crisis talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Hopes of restoring confidence in the rouble and the Russian economy hinged
last night on the possibility that the reformist finance minister Mr Boris
Fyodorov might agree to stay on in the new government.
After three days of crisis talks between President Boris Yeltsin and Mr
Viktor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, there were conflicting reports
about Mr Fyodorov's position. While Interfax news agency said he would
remain in the government, the minister still appeared to be standing by
pre-conditions for staying on.
He told the independent radio station Ekho Moskvy last night: 'I am not
withdrawing my demands. I am not about to take any post if my conditions are
not accepted.'
These terms include a ministerial rank commensurate with the central
position he accords to finance, and a cabinet commitment to a radical reform
policy.
According to Interfax, Mr Chernomyrdin, a political centrist, had refused to
accept Mr Fyodorov's conditions, although the minister had dropped a demand
that Mr Viktor Gerashchenko be relieved of his post as central bank
chairman.
Interfax also said that Mr Alexander Shokhin, like Mr Fyodorov a deputy
premier in the present government, had accepted the post of economics
minister. The indications were that Mr Oleg Soskovets, who is close to Mr
Chernomyrdin and has taken a moderate path on reform, would retain his title
as first deputy prime minister in the new cabinet with overall
responsibility for industrial policy and possibly the economy.
The doubts over Mr Fyodorov's future confirmed indications that forming a
government was growing more difficult, as President Yeltsin fought to retain
both him and a moderate reformer in Mr Shokhin at the levers of the
country's economy.
The markets are reacting badly to the sidelining of leading reformers. Amid
a rapidly worsening financial position, the rouble yesterday again lost more
than Rbs100 to the dollar to stand at Rbs1,607.
Signs of panic began to appear in the banking community and the population.
Queues again formed to exchange roubles for dollars in Moscow.
The possibility that Mr Fyodorov might serve in the new cabinet indicates
the continued commitment by the government and the president to at least the
appearance of economic reform. It also shows the split in the liberal ranks
after the weekend resignation of Mr Yegor Gaidar, the first deputy prime
minister and leading reformer.

FT  20 JAN 94 / Red tape bill to target hundreds of regulations: Big savings
predicted for industry - Fears over new powers for ministers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday announced a sweeping attack on red tape, aimed at
abolishing or changing 450 items of regulation. Areas covered include shop
opening hours, children in pubs, building society lending and the
streamlining of the law on mergers. There will also be legislation to allow
the contracting out of public services in areas where it is presently
illegal.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said the de-regulation
and contracting out bill was 'the biggest bonfire of controls that has taken
place in modern times in this country'. It would save industry 'hundreds of
millions of pounds, at a very modest assumption', he said.
At Westminster, the bill was immediately attacked because of the powers it
would give ministers to amend or repeal laws without primary legislation.
Downing Street officials admitted the measure - originally flagged as an
important part of a legislative programme designed to unite the Conservative
party - would be 'a difficult bill to get through'. But they said the prime
minister was confident of the government's ability to do so.
The bill contains a requirement for ministers to wait 40 days between laying
a draft order before parliament and submitting a final draft for
parliamentary debate. The government said this interim period would allow
for additional parliamentary scrutiny. It suggested that new scrutiny
committees could be established in the Commons and the Lords to perform this
task.
Mr Heseltine said there were 55 pieces of legislation that would be
appropriate for the use of the new powers. A further 22 would need primary
legislation. He said: 'This is the first stage of a deregulation initiative.
It is very important to recognise there will be subsequent stages.'
Mr Francis Maude, a junior Foreign Office minister before losing his seat at
the last election, has been appointed head of a de-regulation taskforce to
carry the programme forward.
Mr Heseltine said the measures were intended to increase the competitiveness
of UK industry. Government departments introducing legislation would have to
consult two or three typical small firms about its effect.
Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry spokesman, said 'ministers must not
be allowed to smuggle in lower standards under the cloak of cutting red
tape'.

FT  20 JAN 94 / Shares surge on interest rate hopes: Lower than expected
retail sales and inflation fuel expectations of a base rate cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, EMMA TUCKER and PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Interest rate fever swept the financial markets yesterday after news of
lower than expected retail sales and inflation in December revived hopes of
a cut in base rates from 5.5 per cent.
Equities soared and closed at new highs, led by shares in medium-sized
companies. Frantic buying pushed the FT-SE Mid 250 index up 3.4 per cent and
the blue chip FT-SE 100 up 1 per cent.
Prices of government gilt-edged stock staged a strong advance of about 1 per
cent. Sterling fell, dropping 1 3/4 pfennigs in London, as investors
reasoned that yesterday's evidence of a slowing recovery might persuade Mr
Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and the Bank of England to reverse their
decision last week to hold interest rates.
Retail sales fell in volume by a seasonally adjusted 0.2 per cent last month
compared with November. Although the Central Statistical Office said the
year-on-year increase, at 4 per cent, was the highest since July, the news
surprised the City which had been expecting a more robust rise following
reports from some of the bigger retailers of buoyant Christmas sales.
Interest rate hopes were further fuelled by yesterday's announcement of the
retail prices index for December. Although the 'headline' rate of inflation
jumped to 1.9 per cent from 1.4 per cent in November, in part due to Budget
tax changes, the rise was less than expected and meant that the headline
rate had remained below 2 per cent for a full calendar year for the first
time since 1946.
An increase to 2.7 per cent from 2.5 per cent in underlying inflation, which
excludes mortgage interest payments, added to the City's belief that
inflation is under control.
However, Treasury ministers gave no encouragement to hopes of lower interest
rates yesterday. Mr Clarke said he was satisfied with the recovery, which
was steady and strengthening.
Mr Stephen Dorrell, the financial secretary to the Treasury, later told BBC
radio's World At One programme that the government would set interest rates
to deliver stable prices and continued good control of inflation.
'The overwhelming lesson of our own economic history must surely be that if
you don't deliver a stable monetary environment here at home, then any
attempt to build a sustainable recovery is built on sand,' he said.
Today financial markets will have further evidence of a possible slowdown in
the pace of recovery to digest. The latest survey of manufacturing and
service companies from the British Chambers of Commerce, published
overnight, said that growth flattened in the final quarter of last year. It
warned that recent employment gains could be reversed.
The regional consumer survey by Gallup and Business Strategies, released
today, highlighted widespread pessimism among consumers about prospects for
their finances this year. It showed that increases in spending are
continuing, but with little or no further acceleration.
While interest rate hopes were the main spur behind yesterday's market
movements, other factors contributed to the surge in equities. Strong
options-related buying of medium-sized companies, worth an estimated Pounds
1bn, collided with stock shortages among market makers to push the FT-SE Mid
250 index up 135.5 points to 4,148.8, making yesterday's 38.1 point gain to
3,475.1 in the FT-SE 100 index appear modest.

FT  19 JAN 94 / International Company News: Restructuring scheme for TAP-Air
Portugal agreed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER WISE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LISBON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Portuguese government has approved a restructuring plan for TAP-Air
Portugal, the state-owned airline. The strategy involves injecting Es180bn
(Dollars 1bn) into the debt-ridden company, reducing the workforce by 2,400
people and seeking a strategic foreign partner.
The approval of the plan ends months of speculation over the future of the
airline. Mr Joaquim Ferreira do Amaral, minister for public works, transport
and communications, said: 'The agreement is bad news for many competitors
who predicted TAP would be forced to close down.'
The state will absorb part of TAP's debt by injecting Es180bn into the
company in four tranches over the next four years. TAP's accumulated debt
reached Es124.4bn in 1993 and operating losses rose to Es35bn, the worst
result in the company's history.
Under the plan, TAP is forecast to return to profits in 1996, with a
forecast net profit of Es300m, growing to Es12.7bn in 1997.
From 1997, when TAP's debt is forecast to have fallen to Es114.5bn, the
company's earnings should be sufficient to cover its own debt liabilities,
according to Mr Ferreira do Amaral.
The airline's staff level of 9,500 people will be cut to 7,110 by 1997. This
implies the loss of 800 jobs in 1994 compared with forecasts that the
company would dismiss 2,000 workers this year.
Wage costs from 1994 to 1997 are estimated at Es15bn.
TAP will abolish all of its flights to North America except to New York and
will drop flights on 15 or 16 secondary routes in Europe, according to the
plan.
But the airline will retain its present structure without spinning off
passenger and baggage handling and aircraft maintenance into separate
companies as envisaged in earlier proposals.
TAP will seek a foreign partner with the main aim of ensuring coverage of
the routes to North America that it is abandoning. Contacts have already
reported to have been made with the US companies Delta Airlines and United
Airlines.
'We have created the conditions by which TAP will be able to enter into an
international partnership without being in a subordinate position,' said Mr
Ferreira do Amaral.
'TAP will now be able to co-operate and associate with other airlines on
equal terms.'
Mr Ferreira do Amaral will travel to Brussels on January 27 to discuss the
restructuring plan with the European Commission.
The key point at issue will be whether the proposals to inject state capital
into TAP contravene European competition laws.

FT  19 JAN 94 / International Company News: Interactive TV move for Dutch
group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KPN, the Dutch telecommunications company which is due to be privatised
before the end of June, has made its first move into interactive television
by agreeing to take a 50 per cent stake in Teleworld, a fast-growing Dutch
company with teletext activities in 10 countries.
The investment will also mean that KPN will be joining forces in interactive
television with Philips, Europe's largest television manufacturer, which
already owns 43.7 per cent of the company and is poised to raise this to 50
per cent.
KPN will be buying its shares in Teleworld from the company's founder Mr
Peter Schouten, who currently owns 54 per cent of the capital. The
transformation of Teleworld into a 50/50 joint venture between KPN's
telecommunications arm PTT Telecom and Philips will also involve the buy-out
of a few smaller shareholders.
Teleworld, which was established in 1990 and now has turnover of Fl 40m
(Dollars 20.5m) and a workforce of 130, is active in nine countries in north
western Europe, including the UK, and in Malaysia. Its activities include
the provision of interactive games and information services on a teletext
basis for commercial television operators.

FT  19 JAN 94 / International Company News: Hagemeyer up 20% to Fl 122m

<TEXT>
Hagemeyer, the Dutch-based international trading group, said preliminary
results for 1993 show a 20 per cent rise in net profit before extraordinary
items to about Fl 122.5m (Dollars 68m) from Fl 102.2m in 1992.
Total net profit, including a previously reported Fl 42m extraordinary gain
on the sale of land in Singapore, rose by more than 55 per cent to Fl 161m
from Fl 103.1m.
Hagemeyer, which is 63 per cent-owned by First Pacific of Hong Kong, said
sales rose to more than Fl 3.9bn from Fl 3.4bn in 1992, and it predicted a
further rise to above Fl 4.5bn for the current year.
'The upward trend in earnings is expected to continue,' the company said.
Final figures for 1993 are scheduled to be published on February 24.
For 1994, the company expected to book more than Fl 75m in extraordinary
profit from an amicable agreement with Matsushita of Japan that it would
stop importing and distributing the Japanese company's products in
Singapore, starting in April.
Matsushita plans to integrate Hagemeyer's distribution activities for the
National, Panasonic and Technics brands into its own regional marketing and
sales company.
The changes in Singapore will have no effect on Hagemeyer's agency
relationship with Matsushita in the Netherlands or its relationship with
JVC, which is majority-owned by Matsushita, in Malaysia, Australia and New
Zealand.
Hagemeyer said it planned to use the extraordinary gain in 1994 to buy out
ABN-Amro Bank's 50 per cent holding in a joint venture set up in late 1993
to finance Hagemeyer's acquisition of Newey &amp; Eyre, one of Britain's largest
electrotechnical wholesalers, from BTR.
The move to buy out the financing vehicle had been expected, but the
extraordinary gain has helped accelerate the timing of Hagemeyer's full
consolidation of Newey &amp; Eyre.

<TEXT>
Societe Generale de Belgique, the diversified Belgian holding company,
appeared yesterday to have added to its war chest for possible acquisitions
by disclosing the sale of 4.1m of its shares in its French parent, Compagnie
Financiere de Suez.
The Suez group said 3.2m of the shares had been bought at around the stock
market price by Goldman Sachs and Banque Indosuez for sale to international
investors. At yesterday's Paris close of FFr 345.30, this sale in Suez would
give the Belgian holding company about FFr1.4bn (Dollars 237.2m).
SGB has brought its cross-holding stake in Suez down to 1.5 per cent from
4.5 per cent, a level which it said it did not intend to change in the
coming months. With its recent sales of shares in CBR, the Belgian cement
company, and in Union Miniere, SGB has lifted liquidity to make possible
purchases.

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan Airlines is to cut its workforce by 5,000 and halve investment, as
part of a four-year restructuring aimed at returning the company to profit.
Yesterday it was presenting its unions with a plan to reduce its workforce
of almost 22,000 to 17,000 by the end of fiscal 1997 through voluntary
retirement, curtailment of new hirings and transfers to subsidiaries.
Restructuring at the airline, Japan's largest, which last year reported a
Y54.9bn (Dollars 508m) pre-tax loss, will cut capital spending to Y440bn
from a planned Y840bn in the next four years. In addition, it aims to cut a
further Y100bn from costs in the next fiscal year. Wages, which were limited
to a 1 per cent increase last year, could be frozen this year. For the
second year running JAL may not hire new stewardesses.
JAL has been hurt by a downturn in business and first-class travel as a
result of Japan's economic slowdown, increased competition on international
routes, particularly from lower-cost US airlines, and a high cost structure.
The restructuring reflects a growing recognition by the group - which has
often been criticised for being an oversized high-cost company - that it
must lower costs and raise its international competitiveness if it is to
survive.
The move was welcomed on the Tokyo stock market where JAL's share price rose
Y10 on the news to close at Y640.
Cuts in capital spending will range across all areas from aircraft to
investment in facilities at the New Kansai International Airport scheduled
to open in September.
Orders for aircraft have been rescheduled so JAL will be taking delivery of
28 aircraft, six fewer than planned.
JAL will order smaller aircraft to raise its share of the domestic market.
The latest restructuring follows a survival plan introduced last year and
extends measures JAL has already adopted. It also plans to maximise savings
by moving more operations to low-cost off-shore bases and extending the use
of low-cost subsidiaries on low-yield routes.
The union representing cabin crew criticised the moves. It said it could not
accept a plan which made employees pay for management failures.

FT  19 JAN 94 / Bentsen hints on Vietnam trade embargo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM BARNES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BANGKOK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US Treasury secretary, suggested yesterday in Bangkok that
there could be an early end to the US trade embargo against Vietnam.
The embargo has isolated Vietnam for 30 years and Mr Bentsen said people
like him wanted to 'get it done; get it behind us'.
Speaking to Thai bankers he said Hanoi had made progress in accounting for
US servicemen missing in action or held as prisoners of war and that a
'strategy of engagement' might be the best way forward.
US officials said that American bankers in the region had told Mr Bentsen
the time had come to end a policy that only served to boost US trade
competitors. Mr Bentsen also said he was 'encouraged' by statements by
leading US legislators such as Democratic Senator John Kerry, who has
indicated that he would support dropping the embargo.
Mr Kerry ended a visit to Hanoi earlier this week and praised the Vietnamese
authorities for their co-operation in resolving the 'missing-in-action'
(MIA) issue. After watching 100 US and Vietnamese soldiers excavate for the
remains of MIAs at the weekend, Mr Kelly said 'all of the signs are moving
in the right direction'
Admiral Charles Larson, currently in Vietnam, is the highest-ranking US
military officer to visit the country since the war ended. Admiral Larson,
commander-in-chief of Pacific Forces, is trying to determine the fate of
2,239 US servicemen still listed as missing.
A US trade embargo has been in place against North Vietnam since 1964; this
was extended to the whole country in 1975 when Communist forces defeated the
US-backed forces in the south.
Last year the US eased restrictions to allow Vietnam to borrow from the
World Bank and the International Monetary Fund and to allow US companies to
bid for projects financed by these institutions.
Mr Bentsen leaves today for China on the last leg of his three-country tour
to encourage Asian nations to open their booming economies to US companies
and exports. He will be the most senior member of the Clinton administration
to visit China. His tour started in Indonesia.

<TEXT>
The French nuclear safety authority yesterday approved the restarting of the
accident-prone Superphenix fast breeder reactor, after three years of safety
repairs and inquiries. The final decision lies with the government, and
ministers are not expected to pronounce for several months.
Conceived in the 1970s as a panacea for energy shortages and nuclear waste,
the reactor was designed to take plutonium byproduct from ordinary reactors
and to produce more fuel than it consumed. But instead the Superphenix, the
only full size 1,200MW fast breeder in the world, has become a costly white
elephant. Completed in 1986 near Lyon at a cost of FFr29bn (Dollars 4.96bn),
it has run at full power for only 174 days.

FT  19 JAN 94 / Economic tide turns in Hungary

<TEXT>
Hungary's government yesterday signalled an end to four years of recession
by declaring in strong terms that recovery was under way.
'Something is moving,' said Mr Ivan Szabo, finance minister, in his new
year's economic report. 'Every indicator shows that some kind of growth has
started.'
Budapest's optimism adds to the growing consensus that eastern Europe is
turning up economically. Poland's GDP grew 4 per cent in 1993, making it
Europe's fastest growing economy, and that momentum is expected to continue
in 1994.
The influential Vienna Institute for Comparative Economic Studies forecast
recovery for eastern Europe in 1994 and the region's stock markets,
glamourised by the fashion for emerging markets, are booming.
Mr Szabo said Hungary's industrial production rose 3-4 per cent in 1993,
while infrastructure investment made the construction industry particularly
lively. The conclusion of land reform in the first half of this year should
allow a recovery in agriculture, which held back the economy in 1993.
The government had forecast that GDP would fall by 0-3 per cent in 1993 and
remain stable in 1994. But a surge in tax revenues from the Christmas
shopping season might prompt a revision of output estimates, Mr Szabo said.
Higher than expected receipts from value-added, income and company taxes
also allowed the central budget to close with a deficit which at Ft200bn
(Pounds 1.3bn) was considerably below independent forecasts.

FT  19 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Anglia TV bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Announcement of a bid for Anglia, the television company, by MAI, the
financial services group, boosted the media sector as investors re-examined
takeover prospects elsewhere.
The Pounds 292m offer values Anglia at 'not less than 637p' a share which,
according to some analysts' calculations, puts it on a premium prospective
p/e of 31.65 times earnings. However, an analyst argued that as long as MAI
could cut costs by Pounds 5m it would make money on the deal. Anglia shares
jumped 180 to 664p, while MAI gained 31 at 315p.
Several analysts suggested that Anglia shareholders got the best of the
deal. They were also eagerly awaiting a response from LWT, which is fighting
off a much lower bid from Granada. There was a feeling that Granada might
have to stump up more money or look at another company - possibly Scottish
Television.
Reflecting that, Granada closed unchanged at 552p after being 9 off at one
stage, while Scottish advanced 25 to 491p and LWT climbed 7 to 675p. HTV,
also seen as a takeover candidate, rose 8 to 119p.
Reuters Holdings receded 34 to 1886p after US house Merrill Lynch turned
more cautious on technical grounds.
Pharmaceuticals group Zeneca was knocked back 12 to 827p as agency broker
James Capel turned seller of the stock and cut its forecast for 1994 profits
by Pounds 25m to Pounds 775m.
London International Group rose 4 to 166p on hopes of an offer for its
troubled photo processing arm. Photo-Me Inter-national, the world's leading
photo-booth manufacturer and operator, said it had reached an advanced stage
in talks to purchase a business with complementary activities.
The latest upsurge in the Hong Kong market, coupled with various broker
recommendations, triggered strong showings from HSBC and Standard Chartered,
both of which are viewed as classic Pacific Rim plays.
Standard, which NatWest Securities labelled a trading buy this week, climbed
38 to 1203p, while HSBC responded to excellent figures from its Bank of East
Asia subsidiary and news that Peregrine, one of the most influential of the
Hong Kong broking houses, had issued a covered warrant on HSBC stock. HSBC
settled 44 higher at 947p.
Kleinwort Benson finally erased painful memories of its Premier Consolidated
Oilfields bought deal, which cost the merchant bank dear in financial and
credibility terms. The shares forged ahead 16 to 654p.
Sun Alliance, down 8 at 387p, was among the Footsie's casualties yesterday.
One of the market's most aggressive marketmaking firms was said to have
failed in an attempt to place a block of 3m Sun shares.
Shell rose 10 to 734p on hints that the sale of its Billiton metals division
to South Africa's Gencor has been salvaged after being called off recently.
Rolls-Royce advanced 9 to 173p on good volume of 8.9m after NatWest
Securities took the stock off its sell list. Metals group Johnson Matthey
appreciated 17 to 568p, boosted by a recommendation from Credit Lyonnais
Laing in a 137-page research document on prospects for the engineering
sector up to 1996. In the review, analyst Mr Paul Compton also urges
investors to buy Rolls-Royce and GKN, 2 1/2 firmer at 571 1/2 p.
The rumoured rights issue from Stanley Leisure arrived, but encouraging
results held the share price fall to 2 at 333p.
There was intense speculation ahead of this morning's Christmas trading
statement from Tesco. Some suggested that the group would announce a one-off
provision of around Pounds 80m for property write-downs. Interest in the
statement has been intensified by the recent price war. Tesco shares slipped
a half-penny to 236 1/2 p.
Turnover in Sears hit 26m following a large placing. The shares added 1 1/2
at 123 1/2 p.
A UBS buy recommendation drove George Wimpey 11 higher to 219p, while talk
that the big cement companies are pressing for a price increase lifted Blue
Circle 9 to 375p and helped RMC put on 11 at 1048p.
Eastern Electricity's share buy-back news saw the stock rise 20 1/2 to 664
1/2 p. London Electricity, however, was the best performing rec, closing 28
stronger at 659p after a Panmure Gordon buy note.

Electrical retailers Dixons and Kingfisher fell heavily as the market took
stock of implications of a potentially damaging official inquiry into
extended warranties.
It is the second official probe in a week to hit the two groups, and follows
news that the Monopolies and Mergers Commission is to investigate the
pricing of video games, one of the biggest selling items for the two
companies.
But stores analysts said this latest inquiry is more worrying in view of the
proportion of profits made from extended warranties - guarantees sold with
electrical appliances.
If the issue is referred to the MMC, and it rules against the retailers, BZW
estimates that Dixons' entire profits - forecast at around Pounds 75m for
this year - could be wiped out.
Dixons shares, hit badly two weeks ago by a profits warning, fell a further
16 to 212p in hefty turnover of 15m. Kingfisher, which owns the Comet chain,
lost 16 1/2 at 706 1/2 p.

Continued fears that British Aerospace may announce provisions of around
Pounds 200m with its next set of results, due to problems at its turbo props
division, once again made it the day's worst performer in FT-SE 100 Index.
Sentiment was also weakened by switching from BAe into Rolls-Royce. Mr Brian
Newman at Henderson Crosthwaite, a long time bull, denied that he had turned
a seller of BAe, which yesterday tumbled 23 to 391p.
Late reports suggested that India had signed a long- awaited Dollars 1.9bn
order for 66 of BAe's Hawk aircraft, but there was no confirmation.

There were said to have been a number of market stories driving Enterprise
Oil shares sharply higher yesterday.
The stock price, a poor performer in the FT-SE 100 and the oil sector
recently, jumped 13 to 462p as the market responded to talk that Elf
Aquitaine, the French state-owned oil company, had put the long-rumoured
sale of its 10 per cent stake in Enterprise Oil on to the back burner.
Worries about the possible sale of Elf's stake in Enterprise have proved a
drag on the latter's share price.
The French group was said to have indicated its preference to sell some of
its other holdings, such as its stakes in Generale des Eaux and Bidermann
International.

FT  19 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Second line stocks surge as rate
hopes revive - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Renewed confidence in prospects for an early cut in UK base rates,
buttressed by strength in British government bonds and in the short sterling
futures contract, brought further gains in equities in London yesterday.
The focus for demand again lay among the market's second line and smaller
capitalised stocks, where investors sought to identify the earnings
prospects which have largely been assimilated in market ratings on the
Footsie's 100 listed issues. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index bounded ahead by 64.5
points to yet another new high of 4,013.3.
Technical factors remained very important in equities, with the shortage of
stock which has plagued the blue chips shifting to the smaller capitalised
stocks. Having been obliged to sell stock to eager investors in the morning,
marketmakers then had the almost impossible task of finding stock for future
delivery.
Comfortable assumptions that base rate cuts would be held back until spring
were suddenly challenged as sterling moved higher against the German D-Mark.
Confidence in the UK bond market built considerably towards the close on the
announcement that the planned bond auction would be smaller than expected.
The FT-SE 100 Share Index closed just under its best with a gain of 29.2 at
3,437, within nine points of the level reached earlier this month but still
25 points under the all-time high of late December. But the pace of advance
in the Footsie 100 Index has been outstripped by that of the FT-SE Mid 250
Index this week as investors, both institutional and private, have sought
out companies likely to benefit from further economic recovery, and for
share prices in which these prospects are not yet fully reflected. High
valuations of prospective earnings in the UK market have unsettled some
investors.
Traders pointed out that the Footsie may now be at the top of its latest
trading range. A survey of the distributive sector published yesterday by
the Confederation of British Industry indicated successful retail sales over
Christmas and the new year, underlining the progress of economic recovery.
Mr Ian Harnett at Strauss Turnbull commented that that the strength of
sterling now provides the chief justification for a base rate cut. Interest
rate hopes will be challenged this morning by publication of the retail
price index (RPI) and also the official retail sales data for last month.
The stock market is expecting a year on year RPI gain of 3 per cent, and a
similar retail sales gain of perhaps 2.4 per cent. Gains in excess of either
of these predictions will raise the spectre of inflation.
The stress on second line stocks was indicated by market volume details
showing that non-Footsie stocks made up around 68 per cent of yesterday's
total of 964.9m shares through the Seaq network. Monday's Seaq volume of
808.1m shares was worth Pounds 1.59bn at retail level.
Equities closed in confident mood, with sterling's strength failing to upset
the blue chip export stocks, and Wall Street helping London with a gain of
5.07 Dow points in early trading. Media stocks stood out, with the Pounds
292m agreed bid for Anglia keeping the domestic TV sector on the alert.
Our report on Monday morning that BZW, the UK investment bank, had raised
its year-end Footsie forecast to 3,900 was incorrect; BZW's forecast remains
at 3,600.

FT  19 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A squeeze in stock index futures sent the March Footsie contract sharply
forward to a strong finish, after a dull and tentative start, writes Joel
Kibazo.
Dealers in the March contract on the FT-SE 100 reported a shaky opening to
the session as the contract traded at 3,413 characterised by sideways
movements, though little selling was reported.
Renewed talk of a reduction in UK base rates was heard mid-morning just as
several leading institutions had decided to start picking up stock, and the
combination of the two factors saw March move slowly forward. Sentiment was
boosted by firm trading in the fixed interest markets.
The positive sentiment gathered pace during the afternoon with the firm
opening on Wall Street, but it was strong demand from both institutions and
independent traders (locals) as they covered short positions that brought a
squeeze in March towards the end of the session.
March closed at 3,460, up 45 on the previous session and 15 points ahead of
its fair value premium to cash of about 5 points. Volume improved to 13,048
contracts.
There was also a slight improvement in turnover in the traded options. The
day's total volume was 45,803 contracts of which 17,299 lots were dealt in
the FT-SE 100 option and 5,121 in the Euro FT-SE 100 option.
Hanson led the league table among the stock options, finishing with a total
of 2,607 lots. It was followed by Land Securities at 2,093 and Abbey
National at 2,079 following a big trade by Kleinwort Benson. Other active
stocks included Dixons, and Tesco.

Brazilian equities retreated from earlier highs, following Monday's 8.5 per

likely after strong gains in the first half of January.
The Bovespa index ended 766, or 1.3 per cent, up on the day at 60,571.
Volume was Cr120bn, the highest this month. Some of Brazil's brokerages and
banks, however, had difficulty trading as a result of a power blackout in
Sao Paulo's financial centre.

FT  19 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Chrysler results help sustain
Dow at record
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US stocks were little changed in largely featureless trading yesterday, but
with the market gaining support from stable bond prices and some better than
expected fourth-quarter results, writes Martin Dickson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended unchanged at 3,870.29, although
maintaining Monday's record close. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 edged up 0.95
to 474.25 and the Nasdaq composite gained 0.84 at 793.02. NYSE volume was
fairly heavy at 309.7m shares and advances outscored falls by 1,198 to 892.
Apart from a dip at the opening, the Dow spent the day in positive
territory, at one time gaining nearly 10 points, but gave up the advance
towards the close.
Sentiment was helped in the morning by stronger than expected results from
Chrysler, the car manufacturer, which reported fourth-quarter earnings per
share of Dollars 2.11, compared to forecasts of around Dollars 1.60.
Chrysler closed Dollars  3/4 higher at Dollars 62 1/2 and the figures buoyed
the rest of the automobile sector, General Motors adding Dollars 1 3/8 at
Dollars 62 1/8 and Ford Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 68 5/8 .
A large number of money centre and super-regional banks also reported
yesterday, and their figures were generally ahead of expectation and showed
a strong improvement in asset quality. However, share prices mostly dipped
on profit-taking. Wells Fargo lost Dollars 2 3/8 at Dollars 133 3/4 ,
Nationsbank Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 49 1/4 , Chemical Banking Dollars 1 at
Dollars 40 1/2 and Citicorp Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 40 7/8 , but Chase
Manhattan firmed Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 35 3/4 .
Trading was also enlivened by a revised takeover bid for Paramount
Communications from Viacom, which slightly raised the cash it is offering
for 50.1 per cent of the company and also improved features of the
securities it is offering for the remaining 49.9 per cent.
Analysts said the new terms appeared to make its bid competitive with the
higher offer on the table from QVC Network and was likely to keep the
takeover battle alive until the February 1 date set by Paramount for final
offers.
Viacom's non-voting 'B' shares, which form the major part of its package of
securities, fell Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 37 3/4 , while QVC dipped Dollars
 1/2 to Dollars 43. Paramount rose Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 80. Blockbuster
Entertainment, which has agreed to be acquired by Viacom as part of the
Paramount bid, held at Dollars 28.
Drugs group Eli Lilly advanced Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 61 5/8 after
announcing plans to divest its medical device and diagnostics businesses and
take Dollars 1.2bn of restructuring and other charges in the fourth quarter.
Controls group Honeywell shed Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 32 3/4 after reporting
fourth-quarter earnings of 85 cents a share, up from 79 cents, while
Grumman, the defence group, rose Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 42 5/8 on
announcing plans to cut operating costs by nearly Dollars 600m over the next
three years.

Toronto rose afresh to set another record high. The TSE 300 index ended 17.7
up at 4,561.9 as rises led declines by 444 to 369 after volume of 73.5m
shares. Financial services remained strong, adding 1.14 per cent at 3,553.1.

FT  19 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Foreigners take profits in
Frankfurt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Contrasting stories were seen, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT continued its downward path as more foreign investors decided the
time had come to take profits. The DAX index slid a further 23.54 to
2,113.84. After hours trading saw the Ibis indicative index rise to
2,130.34. Turnover was DM9.1bn.
The weaker currency and bond markets also contributed to the day's gloom as
prospects for a rate cut receded.
Porsche dropped DM8 to DM830, in line with the market trend, after the car
maker said that it would omit its divided and would see a group loss of up
to DM150m in 1993/94, but breaking even in 1994/95.
By contrast Continental, the tyre manufacturer, added DM2.50 to DM257.50
helped by dollar strength.
ZURICH put in another strong performance, the SMI index adding 26.4 to
3,037.5, with chemicals companies providing the impetus.
Roche certificates added SFr115 to SFr6,555 after news that a new anti-aids
product had successfully completed its first two trials in the US and was
about to begin its third phase of tests. Ciba added SFr17 to SFr725.
Among the insurers, Swiss Re put on SFr6 to SFr696 on the view that Monday's
mark down, after news of the Los Angeles earthquake, had been overdone.
Winterthur continued to benefit from its link with Commerzbank in the German
insurance market. The registered shares put on SFr11 to SFr797.
SMH saw a further rally, after recent losses, the bearers adding SFr8 to
SFr218. Ascom, the troubled telecommunications shed SFr5 to SFr1,370 after
it confirmed that the 1993 deficit would be greater than 1992's SFr46m loss.
AMSTERDAM improved given good gains in heavyweight stocks such as Unilever,
up Fl 3.50 to Fl 227.80, while Hoogovens showed a strong spurt, gaining Fl
2.20 to Fl 56.30, which market sources attributed to a note put out
yesterday by Merrill Lynch.
The AEX index gained 2.23 to 425.16.
PARIS closed the day stronger after a choppy day's trading. The CAC-40 index
ended 12.57 higher at 2,247.35 in turnover of FFr5.2bn.
Suez was heavily traded, closing down FFr3.70 at FFr345.30, following
reports that substantial stakes were being placed. Elf went in the opposite
direction, up FFr5 to FFr403.20, on reports that it was to sell stakes in
holdings.
MILAN was steady after Monday's strong start to the monthly account and the
Comit index rose 2.10 to 617.40.
James Capel commented that the market's immediate response to the calling of
the general election had been favourable on hopes for a clearer outlook for
government policy. However, the broker did not expect the election to be a
major factor driving the market over the next two months, given the
difficulty of assessing the likely composition of the new government.
Montedison ran into profit-taking, shedding L7.60 to L954.10, in turnover of
85.5m shares, still high but sharply down from Monday's 155m.
Olivetti eased L12 to L2,254 after reaching an accord with union groups late
on Monday and showing share price gains earlier in the session.
STOCKHOLM fell back modestly following the recent forward surge. The
Affarsvarlden general index slipped just 0.8 to 1,545.1. Turnover decreased
to SKr3.6bn.
Electrolux and Volvo bucked the downward trend with the former's B shares up
SKr9 to SKr347 on expectations of an improvement in the white good's market.
Volvo B's added SKr2 to SKr665 ahead of today's shareholder's meeting.
MADRID posted a record close as gains in bonds and futures inspired late
buying by investment funds and foreign investors that pushed the general
index 2.20 higher to 338.36.
The construction and electrical sectors posted some of the biggest rises.
Asland rose Pta140 or 6.7 per cent to Pta2,220 while Endesa added Pta110 to
Pta7,580. Sarrio, the paper group, surged Pta60 or 15 per cent to Pta460.
ISTANBUL tumbled 6.1 per cent on profit-taking following the market's recent
high levels. The composite index lost 1,686.26 to 27,907.01, adding to its
decline of some 10 per cent over the last three sessions. Turnover was
TL5,300bn.
The falls have been exacerbated by last week's downgrading of the country's
debt over the worsening budget and trade deficits; but also by worries over
the 40 per cent rise in the index since the beginning of the year.

FT  19 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei dips as Taiwan
tumbles 2.9 per cent

<TEXT>
Share prices fluctuated in a narrow range amid arbitrage selling and
profit-taking by corporations, and the Nikkei average finally closed lower
in spite of buying by foreign investors, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue average finished 210.82, or 1.1 per cent, down at the day's
low of 18,514.55. The session's high was 18,810.28. The Topix index of all
first section stocks lost 4.52 at 1,511.39, but in London the ISE/Nikkei 50
index added 4.31 at 1,251.07.
After opening firmer, the Nikkei soon lost steam on selling for arbitrage
unwinding. The index rebounded in mid-morning trading in line with a
stronger futures market, before falling on selling by corporate investors
wanting to realise profits ahead of the March book closing.
Losers outnumbered gainers by 583 to 399, with 178 issues unchanged. Volume
remained flat, at 280m shares.
Investors remained cautious ahead of the upper house vote on the political
reform bill today. Overseas investors, who have supported the recent rally,
also scaled back their purchases. But in spite of the Nikkei's decline,
traders took comfort in advances in Nippon Telegraph and Telephone and East
Japan Railway, both considered important benchmarks for market sentiment.
NTT gained Y6,000 at Y839,000, rising for the 14th consecutive day on a
report that the government will invest in next generation telecom networks
using optical fibres. JR East climbed Y7,000 to Y483,000 on buying by
financial institutions.
Construction companies were weak following the arrest of executives at
Ohbayashi due to their alleged involvement in a bribery scandal. Obayashi
dropped Y25 to Y618 and Shimizu retreated Y28 to Y815.
Profit-taking depressed high-technology issues. Matsushita Electric
Industrial fell Y20 to Y1,560 and Sony Y100 to Y5,830. Automobile shares
were also weak, Toyota Motor losing Y30 at Y1,830 and Honda Motor slipping
Y10 to Y1,620.
Japan Airlines firmed Y10 to Y640 as investors were encouraged by its
restructuring programme, which includes staff cuts through attrition and
transfers. All Nippon Airways moved up Y10 to Y1,100. Oki Electric, which
also announced a restructuring plan, appreciated Y5 to Y584.
In Osaka, the OSE average dipped 110.86 to 20,601.00 in volume of 45.8m
shares.
Roundup
Pacific Rim markets took divergent routes.
TAIWAN finished with a 2.9 per cent fall on a late wave of heavy selling
after the market failed to sustain early gains.
The weighted index, which scored an intraday high of 6,179, ended a net
178.50 off at 5,876.43. Turnover was again high, totalling TDollars 98.83bn
against Monday's TDollars 105.02bn.
The market remains vulnerable to profit-taking as sentiment has been
dampened by the weekend news that authorities had shelved a proposal to
raise the Dollars 5bn ceiling on foreign investment in the market.
Investors were also worried by growing market talk that the central bank
might tighten monetary policy slightly after the Chinese New Year in early
February.
HONG KONG moved sharply higher after news of a Sino-US textile accord and on
anticipation of strong corporate results, although profit-taking dragged
prices off their peaks.
The Hang Seng index closed 224.77, or 2.1 per cent, higher at 11,017.69, but
off a late-afternoon peak of 11,218.24.
AUSTRALIA slipped off its early highs to finish lower on the day on
profit-taking, leaving the All Ordinaries index 6.1 down at 2,232.1.
SEOUL saw a technical rebound, as blue chip manufacturing issues and shares
with low p/e ratios pushed the market up. The composite index rose 9.81 to
873.06.
SINGAPORE closed mixed in tepid trading as the market consolidated last
week's sharp volatility. Malaysian shares traded over the counter continued
to be weak, still reeling from last week's sell-offs.
The Straits Times Industrial index edged forward 3.37 to 2,280.41.
KUALA LUMPUR recovered from the day's lows to close slightly higher on
balance as investors picked up stocks made cheaper by the recent correction.
The composite index was finally 6.08 points up at 1,110.22, after touching
1,085.56 in the morning.
BOMBAY finished lower on unsubstantiated rumours of an impending rise in
petroleum prices, and continuing settlement problems in the Ahmedabad stock
exchange. The BSE 30-share index receded 69.85 to 3,951.02.
NEW ZEALAND continued to move ahead, reassured by the December quarter
consumer price index, which proved in line with expectations. The NZSE-40
capital index ended 6.43 higher at 2,248.40.
BANGKOK edged higher as investors consolidated their positions. The SET
index put on 2.92 at 1,477.03.
MANILA rose slightly as selling pressure eased and buyers sought shares at
the lower prices. The market index added 0.44 at 2,910.97.

FT  19 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets: Jordan finds incentive in Middle East
peace talks - James Whittington tracks Amman stock market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES WHITTINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Some of the richest traders on Jordan's stock exchange see themselves as
political analysts rather than market specialists. Which perhaps explains
why the Amman Financial Market - with 110 listed companies and a
capitalisation of JD3.5bn (Dollars 5bn) - often reacts so vigorously to each
small step in the Middle East peace process.
An economic pact signed between Jordan and the Palestine Liberation
Organisation earlier this month boosted shares by 3.17 per cent in one day.
The general price index, which had been languishing at around 158 throughout
December, shot up to 170.67 on the day after the agreement was signed, while
the value of trade was up to JD10.7m from a JD2m average a month earlier.
Admittedly, the market dropped by around 8 points when the local press
pointed out the agreement meant very little in real terms. Within a few
days, the self-appointed analysts cashed in their winnings and the price
index jolted down to 164, where it has remained. Yesterday the index closed
at 164.46.
Such knee-jerk trading gives a taste of the year ahead. The bourse will have
plenty of politics to chew over as the Middle East peace process creeps
slowly forward. And it will continue to attract foreign interest as one of
the most profitable and well-developed open markets in the region.
Buoyed by two successive years of strong real economic growth, sustained
government commitment to International Monetary Fund reforms, and high
liquidity, the market's index rose by 30 per cent in 1992 and was a further
23 per cent up by the end of last year. Market turnover in 1993 was JD968m,
and on the basis of earnings, the overall price/earnings ratio was 21.7.
While the government and its agencies hold substantial stakes in many
Jordanian companies, notably in tourism and minerals companies, it is
nevertheless among the most highly traded markets in the region.
Mr Miles Morland of Blakeney Consultants in London, a specialist on Middle
East markets, reckons that at least half of total issued stock is tradeable,
which is far higher than the regional average. As important, in Mr Morland's
view, is the degree of local participation: he estimates there are around
100,000 players. 'It has a broad domestic investor base and is thought of as
a natural home for savings,' he says.
Such buoyancy is attracting considerable outside interest. Official figures
show at least 15 per cent of the market is non-Jordanian, mostly in the
hands of Gulf Arabs. Only 2 to 3 per cent is judged to be held by non-Arabs.
But this should change as more western investors turn their attention to the
Middle East in light of last year's success on other regional emerging
markets.
Ten leading institutions, including Lehman Brothers, Goldman Sachs, Baring
Securities and Citicorp, recently won approval to trade on the Amman
Financial Market and, according to Mr Dan Smaller of Lehman Brothers, the
market can expect 'substantial' inward investment during 1994.
'The peace process has taken away a big risk. Even if the details of peace
take time to negotiate, the breakthrough has removed a big obstacle,' he
says, adding that he expects Lehman to commit up to Dollars 25m to the
market during the first quarter of this year.
Non-Arab foreign investors must obtain approval from the prime minister's
office in Amman before trading. Local brokers say this takes a matter of
weeks, although it has been known to take months because of the kingdom's
vague investment law and objections from the previous parliament over
foreign ownership of local companies. But this should change in 1994.
Mr Umayya Toukan, the director general of Jordan's bourse, says amendments
to the law will explicitly encourage foreign investment in the market and
the new parliament will be more favourable to this than its predecessor.
The standard restriction for non-Jordanians is that foreigners are not
allowed to own more than 49 per cent of most businesses. But capital and
dividends can be easily repatriated as long as foreign currency brought in
was declared for original investment.
While relatively high gains can be made on Jordan's desert bourse, it is not
for the faint-hearted. Not only is there a dearth of information on listed
companies, but trading arrangements badly need updating: a new and
computerised building is planned to replace the present souk-like trading
floor.

FT  19 JAN 94 / Markets Report: Dollars slips in volatile trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar failed yesterday to build on recent rises against the D-Mark and
the yen, retreating against both currencies in fairly volatile trading,
writes Philip Gawith.
The dollar and most other leading currencies were firmer against the D-Mark
in early trading. Analysts and dealers said the tone of the Bundesbank's
latest monthly report, which held out little hope of an early cut in German
interest rates to speed growth, had not helped the German currency. But
dollar sales by European central banks and worries about US-Japanese trade
tensions sapped the dollar's strength in afternoon trading.
The dollar finished London trading at DM1.7487, down from an earlier high of
around DM1.7540 and Monday's close of DM1.7553. In New York it ended at
DM1.7465.
Mr Avinash Persaud, head of currency research at JP Morgan (Europe), said
the dollar, after breaking through last year's high of DM1.7480, might have
been expected to attract new investors at this level. He cited two main
reasons for its failure to rise further.
First, the sale of dollars by European central banks for reserve management
purposes: banks had to repay by the end of January heavy borrowings they
made from the Bundesbank in the ERM crisis of last August, Mr Persaud said.
They were taking advantage of recent dollar strength to buy cheap D-Marks.
A second factor was the weakness over the past few days of the dollar
against the yen which may be capping the advance of the dollar in other
markets. The dollar closed in London at Y110.75, down from Y111.08 on
Monday. In New York it finished at Y110.79.
Mr Mark Austin of Hongkong and Shanghai Banking said this was a function of
the apparent lack of progress between the US and Japan in talks aimed at
curbing the trade deficit with Japan, particularly in relation to the US.
The latest indication of discord on the trade front came on Monday evening
when US Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen expressed concern about lack of
progress in ongoing framework talks on trade.
At the start of the new year, many operators were betting on strong dollar
gains against the yen. However, the Bentsen comment and those of other US
officials expressing dissatisfaction with trade developments have prompted a
number of them to turn bearish on the dollar. Some dealers suggested that
the US would now try to talk up the yen.
Moreover, as Mr Adrian Cunningham, currency economist at UBS in London,
pointed out, market expectations were that Japanese trade figures later this
week would show an increase in Japan's surplus. This was putting upward
pressure on the yen. However, this was expected to be short-lived if the
Japanese government announces a stimulatory fiscal package later this week.
The market will look to tomorrow's US November merchandise trade figures for
direction on the dollar and yen. The US trade gap is expected to have edged
up slightly to Dollars 10.55bn in November from Dollars 10.5bn in October.
Market participants took a bearish view of the D-Mark in spite of
yesterday's gains.
'The longer they delay cutting rates, the deeper the German recession will
get,' said Mr Cunningham of UBS, referring to the Bundesbank. 'The D-Mark is
in a lose-lose situation at the moment.'
Mr Steve Hannah, head of research at IBJ International, commented: 'I do not
think we will see any big moves until Thursday when the Bundesbank council
meets. Everybody accepts that German interest rates have still got a lot
further to fall this year, but nobody is quite sure when.'
Although the market is not expecting a rates cut, Mr Hannah said he would
not be surprised if there were a cut since there had not been a reduction in
official rates since October and some movement was becoming overdue. 'I do
not think it would be inconsistent for them at this stage to cut rates. I
think it is quite possible,' he said. Denmark's central bank yesterday said
it would lower its discount and key deposit rates to 5.75 per cent from 6
per cent, effective today.
Mr Austin of HK Bank said the cut followed recent comments by the central
bank governor that he saw no reasons why Danish interest rates should not
fall as low as 3 per cent. However, Mr Austin added that it was unlikely
that any other European countries would follow the Danish lead.
The D-Mark's rebound left sterling slightly easier at DM2.618 after a quiet
day, against Monday's DM2.6184. But the pound rose to Dollars 1.4972 from
Dollars 1.4918.
On the London money market, the Bank of England forecast a liquidity
shortage of Pounds 950m early in the day, later revised upwards to Pounds
1.1bn. The Bank did not operate in the early round and its overall
assistance was only Pounds 782m, of which about Pounds 510m was late
assistance at unspecified rates.
The rouble fell to a new low of 1,504 to the dollar from 1,402 on fears of
economic turmoil after the weekend resignation of the reforming minister
Yegor Gaidar.
A dealer from Stolichny Bank in Moscow was quoted as saying: 'The rouble has
nowhere to go but down. The economy is already in a mess, with or without
Gaidar.'
In the German money markets yesterday, the Bundesbank confirmed the repo at
a fixed rate of 6 per cent, a clear signal, said Mr Hannah, that monetary
policy is on hold.

FT  19 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Taking the heat out of diamond
fever - The Australian Stock Exchange's new code for reporting discoveries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Diamonds, always a girl's best friend, have in recent months also become a
stock market speculator's dream. So much so that the Australian Stock
Exchange has quietly adopted a new reporting code for diamond exploration
results, mineral resources and ore reserves.
This has been devised by the Joint Ore Reserves Committee - a
standard-setting body formed in the nickel boom days of the early-1970s and
backed by the Australian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, the Australian
Mining Industry Council, and the Australian Institute of Geoscientists.
The code, says the committee, represents the first time anyone has attempted
to standardise the way in which diamond discoveries should be reported and
ensure that investors are given a reasonable idea of the commercial
significance of exploration results. The problem is simple: diamonds, by
their nature, are easy to find, but discovering a large-scale,
economically-viable diamond resource is another matter entirely.
'To the best of my knowledge, it's also the first time such a standard has
been adopted by a stock exchange,' adds Mr Ray Schoer, director of
operations at the ASX. The Australian exchange, however, may not be out on a
limb for long: the JORC reports inquiries and requests for copies of the
code from both the US and Canada, where a diamond rush has been under way
for a couple of years.
Laudable though the initiative may be, it comes not a moment too soon. Two
recent incidents in Australia have demonstrated all-too-clearly the
volatility which can surround diamond-related stocks.
The first was Great Central Mines, a Melbourne-based exploration business
whose shares jumped from around the ADollars 7 to as much as Dollars 19 last
spring, capitalising the loss-making company at a staggering ADollars
1bn-plus.
That performance was influenced by a discovery of 'microdiamonds' in the
Greater Nabberu region of Western Australia, which GCM's chairman and
managing director, Mr Joseph Gutnick, described as 'significant' but was
judged uneconomic by the company's joint venture partner, Stockdale
Prospecting, a subsidiary of De Beers, the South African mining house.
Today the twinkle has faded. GCM's shares are back in the ADollars
9.50-Dollars 10 range, despite some institutional support in the wake of a
rather more substantial gold discovery.
The second instance of runaway diamond shares occured only last month, and
concerned Cambridge Gulf Exploration, a stockmarket newcomer. Cambridge
shares, which had been issued at 25 cents in July, surged above ADollars 4
in mid-December on news that the company had found diamonds in the Bonaparte
Gulf, off Western Australia. When Cambridge released the details of this
discovery - stemming from a small sample of sea-bed gravel - the ASX
demanded more information about the sampling methods, the location of the
discovery, and so on. Today, the shares are trading at about ADollars 2.20.
But, while GCM and Cambridge have grabbed the headlines, one JORC member
says that the lack of guidelines on diamond-related reporting was a much
more fundamental problem. 'GCM and Cambridge were just a manifestations of
the fact that diamonds were becoming hot news. But a dozen other companies,
perfectly straightforward, were also unsure how to present their results'.
In essence, the new code aims to ensure that anyone reporting diamond
exploration results gives investors some clues as to the commercial
significance of the find. It carries a cautionary note, for example, stating
that diamond valuations 'have only been considered reliable on parcels of at
least 2,000 carats of diamonds from a single deposit'. 'Valuations placed on
a small number of diamonds from exploration samples become meaningless and
are likely to be misleading,' it continues.
The code goes on to require details of the professional valuation experience
of anyone reporting on a parcel of diamonds; to set out sampling information
required; to insist that reports of indicator minerals be prepared 'by a
suitably qualified person; and formally to define 'microdiamonds' as those
being less than 0.4mm in size and weighing less than 0.001 carats.
'By definition, pre-resource mineralisation must be considered to be
mineralisation of significance,' states the code. 'The occurence of
individual diamonds or microdiamonds in surficial desposits or from
inadequately-sized samples from a primary or secondary rock source would not
usually qualify as pre-resource mineralisation'. In short, while the outback
may glitter, that, in itself, does not mean anything of substance.
For all practical purposes, says Mr Schoer, the new strictures come into
effect immediately. Existing listing rules demand that the market be kept
informed. So, citing this broad requirement, the ASX will require
exploration companies to meet the best practice levels set down in the code.
Analysts are generally grateful. 'I think it will be a great help to
investors,' says Mr David Kauler at Pru-Bache, for example. 'I think it is
fair to say that there is a problem in industry reporting, especially with
the junior explorers. This will go a long way to improving the quality of
the results.'

report
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
London Metal Exchange base metal markets mostly edged lower yesterday
following the recent bull run.
ALUMINIUM prices marked time for much of the session as investors awaited
news from the multilateral talks in Brussels on stemming the present
oversupply. The talks are continuing today and may be extended if no
conclusion is reached. At the LME the three months aluminium price ended
kerb trading at Dollars 1,208.50 a tonne, down Dollars 7.50 on the day.
ZINC kept its rise going, the three months position putting on Dollars 5 to
close at Dollars 1,039.50 a tonne, as the market continued to ignore the
inexorable rise in LME warehouse stocks. Traders explained that speculative
interest was being sucked into the market by the perception that smelter
cutbacks would happen soon.
At the London precious metals market spot SILVER lost 6 cents of Monday's
13-cent rise to close at 525.5 cents a troy ounce and gold fell Dollars 1.25
to Dollars 391.25 an ounce after recoiling from stiff resistance at Dollars
393.
Chartists said there was support for silver at Dollars 5.25 an ounce and
although the market was becoming overbought.
London COCOA futures closed lower, erasing some of the gains made over the
previous few days, while COFFEE recouped early losses.

FT  19 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Guyana's gold output boosted
sharply by new mine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES

<DATELINE>
   KINGSTON, JAMAICA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Guyana's gold production last year reached 296,940 ounces, almost four times
the 1992 level. The increase was the result of output from a new mine which
began production a year ago.
The Omai mine, which is owned by Cambior Incorporated and Golden Star
Resources of Canada and the Guyana government, produced 209,000 ounces in
its first year, with traditional miners producing the rest.
Gold production in the English-speaking republic in South America is
expected to increase this year, with government officials forecasting
production of 250,000 ounces from the Omai mine and 100,000 ounces from
traditional miners.
The mine, a USDollars 152m investment, with open pits over 16 square miles,
is expected to yield 1.9m ounces over ten years.
Guyana's other major commodities did not fare as well. Bauxite ore
production last year fell to 873,000 tonnes, 3.6 per cent less than 1992
production.
Officials said that the decline was caused by the flooding of some mines by
unexpectedly heavy rains. But they have forecast a better performance in
1994 because of 'administrative improvements' in the industry. Minproc of
Australia has been given a contract by the Guyanese government to manage the
state-owned bauxite industry.
Sugar production fell last year by 4,000 tonnes to 243,000 tonnes, but the
country was able to meet in export quota commitments of 165,000 tonnes to
the European Union, and 15,000 tonnes to the US the officials said.

FT  19 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Omani minister to press on with
non-Opec tour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Efforts to prop up weak oil prices by co-ordinating a worldwide cut in
output by major producing countries are to resume in the next few days
despite few signs of any significant progress.
Traders yesterday reacted sceptically to news that Mr Said bin Ahmad, the
Omani oil minister, would resume his tour of producers outside the
Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries. In late London trading the
benchmark Brent Blend fell briefly below Dollars 13.75 a barrel, compared
with Monday's closing price of Dollars 14.09.
Mr Shanfari met his Saudi counterpart, Mr Hisham Nazir, in Riyadh yesterday
to review the results of his recent visits to a number of independent oil
producers. A statement said the two men discussed the 'ways and means that
lead to safeguarding the balance in the market'.
Mr Shanfari said that 'within days' he would visit those producers not
included in his original tour. It included stops in the UK and Norway, the
two independent producers whose rising North Sea output over the past year
has been singled out by some Opec members as undermining their attempts to
steady oil markets.
Both governments have said they would not participate in any co-ordinated
cuts.
Saudi Arabia, the world's largest exporter, has steadfastly rejected any
production cuts from its present Opec quota of 8m barrels a day unless
non-Opec producers also participate.

FT  19 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: BHP begins talks on marketing
Canadian find
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BHP Minerals has begun talks with the international diamond trade on ways to
market output from the Australian group's potential new mine in northern
Canada.
The discussions reinforce optimism that BHP and its Canadian partner, Dia
Met Minerals, will press ahead later this year with construction of a mine
in the Lac de Gras area, 300 km north-east of Yellowknife, capital of the
Northwest Territories.
Mr Hugo Dummett, BHP's director of exploration in North America, says that,
'if all goes according to schedule', the property could be in production by
1997.
Mr Dummett adds that BHP has held discussions 'with everyone in the
marketplace', including De Beers' London-based Central Selling Organisation,
which organises the cartel that controls the world rough (uncut)diamond
trade. He says, however, that so far 'no commitment has been made to
anybody'.
BHP says that it has assured other players that it recognises the delicate
balance of the market and that it will act 'responsibly' in marketing stones
from the Lac de Gras deposit. Analysts expect that at least a portion of the
mine's production will be channelled through the CSO.
A final decision on the mine and on the distribution of its production will
not be made until completion of a bulk-sampling programme, which is about to
get under way. BHP has imported a 10-tonne bulk-sampling plant from South
Africa and has set up a 112-person camp at the site. The plant will test at
least 8,500 tonnes of rock from at least two of the most promising
kimberlite pipes.
Mr John Lydall, analyst at First Marathon Securities in Toronto, predicts
that, based on exploration results from 15 of the 26 pipes discovered so
far, the Lac de Gras property could generate 'substantially' more cash flow
than even American Barrick's flagship Goldstrike gold mine in Nevada.
According to estimates by diamond appraisers in London and Antwerp, the
value of the most recent Lac de Gras samples equates to USDollars 140 per
tonne of mined material. Assuming mining and processing costs of about
Dollars 27.50 a tonne, Mr Lydall calculates a gross profit margin of some
Dollars 12.50 a tonne. This would translate into a pre-tax cash flow of
Dollars 1.7m a day from a mine with a daily throughput of 15,000 tonnes.
Mr John Hainey, analyst at Canaccord Capital in Toronto, tentatively
predicted in a recent report that four or five kimberlite pipes would be
developed at Lac de Gras.

FT  19 JAN 94 / Government Bonds: Gilts rally on signs of falling borrowing
requirement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE and MARTIN DICKSON

<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UK government bonds rallied more than a point at the long end yesterday in
response to the Bank of England's announcement that it will auction Pounds
2.75bn of 6 1/4 per cent Treasury stock due 2010 on January 26. The size of
the auction was well below market expectations of between Pounds 3bn and
Pounds 3.25bn, while the maturity and the coupon came as no surprise.
Analysts interpreted the smaller amount of stock on offer as a sign that the
funding requirement was falling, and that future auctions were more likely
to raise in the region of Pounds 2.75bn to Pounds 3bn. In the past year,
auctions have ranged from Pounds 3bn to Pounds 3.5bn.
The Bank's decision to set the partly-paid element in March added weight to
this view.
The 8 3/4 per cent gilt due 2017 rose 1 1/16 point to 126 11/32 , while at
the shorter end, the 6 per cent gilt due 1999 rose  11/32 point to 101 5/32
. The long gilt future rose  27/32 to 119.02.
Although there was not a great deal of activity yesterday, analysts were
optimistic that the recent buyers' strike was coming to an end. They said
favourable news about inflation - the retail prices index for December is
due to be published today - would also encourage buyers.
The mood on other European government bond markets also improved yesterday
after a shaky start to trading. Most showed gains in late trading. German
government bonds rose  1/4 point, as the market awaited tomorrow's
Bundesbank council meeting.
Danish government bonds rose by as much as a  1/2 point from the day's lows
following the Danish national bank's decision to cut the discount and key
deposit rates to 5.75 per cent from 6 per cent. They ended the day around a
 1/4 point higher.
Analysts said that although the cut in interest rates had been widely
expected, it still had a positive impact on bond prices because it
underlined the favourable outlook for the Danish bond market.
One analyst at a Danish bank in London noted that the yield differential
between 10-year benchmark Danish and German government bonds now stood at
less than 30 basis points. Analysts expect the differential to narrow
further.
Japanese government bonds and futures continued to weaken as the market
remained gloomy about the government's intentions regarding its fiscal
package. Worries about trade tensions between the US and Japan added to the
market's woes, analysts said.
The March contract broke below the technical support level of 115 in Tokyo,
losing 1 1/4 points to 114.95, but rebounded to 115.15 in London trading.
Liffe reported that its Japanese government bond futures contract set a new
daily record of 6,565 contracts yesterday, beating its previous daily record
of 5,574 contracts set last May.
The No 157 benchmark Japanese government bond fell just under a  1/4 point
to 105.53 in Tokyo, and continued to lose ground in London trading.
US Government bonds made small gains at the longer end in light and largely
directionless trading yesterday, as the market awaited fresh economic
statistics later in the week.
The benchmark 30-year Treasury issue ended the day at 99 13/16 , up 5/16 ,
to yield 6.259, while the 10-year issue was up  3/16 at 100 13/32 to yield
5.685.
Volume was light at the market opened after Monday's Martin Luther King Day
holiday and may also have been slowed by the Los Angeles earthquake.
The day began with a soft tone and small initial losses, but then saw modest
gains in afternoon trading, which dealers attributed partly to short
covering.
However, traders remained jittery about the economic outlook following a run
of better-than-expected statistics late last week, which hit bond prices
hard. The market was also concerned about today's announcement by the
Treasury of details of its next auction of two- and five-year notes.

FT  19 JAN 94 / International Bonds: Sweden Dollars 2bn deal steals
limelight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Eurobond sector saw another deluge of issues, absorbing some Dollars
2.4bn of US dollar floating-rate notes (FRNs), several sterling issues, and
an assortment of other currencies.
Grabbing the limelight in the dollar FRN sector was the Kingdom of Sweden's
Dollars 2bn issue of seven-year notes via CS First Boston and UBS. The notes
pay a coupon of three-month Libor less 12.5 basis points, and were sold at a
fixed re-offer price of 99.75 to yield some 8 basis points below Libor.
While the lead managers reported demand from European and far eastern
accounts, there was a general consensus that the deal was no 'blow-out,' and
would take some time to place.
Some syndicate managers attributed this to the pricing, which they said was
on the tight side.
'It would have worked better around Libor minus six,' said one primary
dealer in London. Another trader pointed out that most central banks, which
tend to be keen buyers of sovereign FRNs, cannot buy paper with maturities
exceeding five years, implying the deal would take some time to place.
However, the deal's status as a new seven-year benchmark and its five-year
call protection are seen to help, allowing the issue to be broadly placed in
coming weeks.
Meanwhile, a Dollars 150m 10-year floater for CS First Boston was one of the
day's success stories. The notes, which have a 5 per cent floor and pay a
coupon of six-month Libor less 12.5 basis points, were snapped up by
continental European retail accounts and ended at 100 5/8 bid, well above
their par issue price.
The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development issued Dollars 200m of
one-year 'range-floaters' via Merrill Lynch. The notes are structured so
that interest only accrues when three-month Libor falls within a specific
range during certain dates.
The day's two straight US dollar bonds were deemed to be aggressively priced
and met with a lukewarm reception.
General Electric Capital Corporation issued Dollars 250m of 6 per cent
10-year bonds via Deutsche Bank. At the re-offer price of 99.819, the bonds
yielded 21 basis points over the relevant Treasury bond, which was
considered too tight by most traders.
'Something in the high 20s would have been more appropriate,' said one
trader. After the syndicate broke, the spread widened slightly.
Another Dollars 250m of three-year bonds for DSL Bank via ABN Amro got a
similarly cool reception, yielding only 13 basis points over the
corresponding Treasury note at issue.
Traders pointed out that the new US three-year notes, to be auctioned in
February, will make the DSL paper look even more expensive as it will yield
roughly the same as the new US notes.
Meanwhile, British Gas launched the first-ever 50-year Eurosterling bond. It
issued Pounds 200m of 7 1/8 per cent bonds due 2044 via CS First Boston. The
bonds were priced to yield some 50 basis points over the 8 3/4 per cent gilt
due 2017 at issue.
Buoyed by the gilt market rally, but also by strong investor demand, the
bonds ended the day at 99.40 bid, yielding 49 basis points over the long
gilt, the lead manager said.
In the domestic sterling market, Dudley Metropolitan Borough Council issued
Pounds 100m of 25-year 7 per cent bonds via UBS. The bonds were priced to
yield some 65 basis points over the long gilt due 2017.
The deal follows recent issues by the City of Salford and Leicester City
Council.
The first-ever Swedish krone global bond will feature prominently on today's
new issue calendar. Swedish Export Credit (SEK) is expected to launch
SKr2.5bn of 7.4-year bonds via Merrill Lynch, yielding between 10 and 15
basis points over the 13 per cent Swedish government bonds due 2001.

FT  19 JAN 94 / International Capital Markets: OMLX sets launch date for Mid
250 contract
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
OMLX, the London-based equity derivatives exchange, will launch its FT-SE
Mid 250 futures and options on February 4, ahead of rival contracts planned
by the London International Financial Futures &amp; Options Exchange (Liffe).
The exchange has also appointed 10 marketmakers and four designated brokers.
They are required to make prices continuously in the contracts, but there is
no obligation to quote prices at a pre-determined bid/offer spread.
The FT-SE Mid 250, which consists of medium-sized UK stocks, has
substantially outperformed the more widely followed FT-SE 100 index in the
past 12 months.
Liffe says it is still preparing the ground for its own FT-SE 250 contracts.
The specifications for the OMLX contracts will be similar to those for
Liffe's existing FT-SE 100 contracts, except that the value of each index
point will be Pounds 10 rather than Pounds 25. This means that with the
FT-SE 250 index at 4,000 points, the nominal value of the futures contract
would be Pounds 40,000.
OMLX announced last week that, as well as standard contracts, it would
launch 'flex' or flexible contracts which can be tailored to individual
requirements. The exchange fees will be the same as for the FT-SE 100
contracts.

FT  19 JAN 94 / International Company News: AGF chairman's challenge in
countdown to sell-off - John Ridding examines a key appointment in the
French insurance sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Antoine Jeancourt-Galignani was yesterday appointed as the new chairman
of Assurances Generales de France, one of the country's largest insurance
groups, and a candidate for privatisation this year.
Mr Jeancourt-Galignani, who moves to AGF from the head of Banque Indosuez,
will succeed Mr Michel Albert, who was appointed earlier this month as one
of the six lay members of the monetary policy council of the Bank of France.
The expected change at the head of AGF is the latest step in a reshuffle of
chairmen at state-owned groups slated for privatisation by the centre-right
government of Mr Edouard Balladur.
Mr Michel Pebereau was appointed as head of Banque Nationale de Paris prior
to its privatisation last October, while Mr Philippe Jaffre and Mr Jacques
Friedmann have respectively taken charge of Elf-Aquitaine, the oil group,
and Union des Assurances de Paris, France's biggest insurance group.
Like Mr Pebereau and Mr Jaffre, the new AGF chairman is a graduate of
France's elite Ecole Nationale d'Administration and started his career in
the Tresor, the country's financial administration. But his latest
appointment is not considered to be politically motivated, and is more a
reflection of his financial background and his experience of privatisation
while at Banque Indosuez. The investment bank has advised the government on
several privatisation issues.
Since joining Banque Indosuez in 1979, Mr Jeancourt-Galignani has
established a reputation as a respected financier. He failed, however, to
secure the chairmanship of Cie de Suez, the bank's parent company.
Mr Jeancourt-Galignani will now focus on the preparation of AGF's
privatisation. The sale of the insurance group is expected to follow that of
Elf-Aquitaine and UAP and could take place in the second half of the year.
AGF has proved relatively resilient in the face of the French recession. In
the first half of last year, the group reported net profits of FFr1.4bn
(Dollars 235m), although Mr Albert warned of a more difficult second half.
The insurance group has also made progress in resolving outstanding
problems. In particular, a government-backed recovery plan has been
concluded for Comptoir des Entrepreneurs, the loss-making property bank in
which AGF has a 30 per cent stake.
'Its property-related problems are being sorted out,' said one industry
analyst in Paris.
The prospect of privatisation could also prompt the establishment of a
partnership with Credit Lyonnais, the state-owned bank. Industry observers
in Paris argue that Credit Lyonnais could become one of AGF's core of stable
long term investors after privatisation, creating a strategic alliance
similar to the relationship between BNP and UAP.
Mr Jeancourt-Galignani's departure also raises questions about strategy at
Suez. Banque Indosuez has traditionally enjoyed a high level of independence
from its parent company, but Mr Gerard Worms, Suez chairman, has indicated
that he wants to create a more-centralised financial services group and
could use Mr Galignani's exit to bring Indosuez under stronger central
control.

FT  19 JAN 94 / International Company News: Gold Fields ahead at mid-term to
R143m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

<TEXT>
Gold Fields of South Africa, the mining house whose investments include
holdings in some of the country's richest gold mines, reported a 5 per cent
improvement in pre-tax profit to R143m (Dollars 42m) in the half-year to
December 31 from R136m the previous year. The interim dividend is maintained
at 70 cents a share.
The group looks set to arrest a four-year slide in earnings by the year-end
in June as the recovery in the gold price in 1993 translated into sharply
higher dividend receipts from its gold mining investments.
The turnround in the gold market also masks the disappointing performance of
the group's R1.7bn developing Northam Platinum mine and struggling base
metal operations, knocked by the downward drift in copper, lead and zinc
prices for much of the past year.
Investment income rose to R133m from R115m, more than making up for a
decline in interest receipts on the group's lower cash reserves.
Costs and expenditure were flat at R86m including exploration spending of
R19m, of which one-third was spent on the group's recently-acquired gold
mining interests in Ghana, Ecuador and Venezuela. With a negligible tax
provision of R5m against R12m last year, after-tax income was up at R138m
against R124m.
Mr Robin Plumbridge, chairman, said he was confident of a modest improvement
in bottom line profit at the year end from the R287m reported last year with
the rise in interim distributable profit to R132m from R118m.
The 'surprising strength' of the gold market as prices returned to Dollars
390 in December boded well for the year ahead as it seemed the price spike
to more than Dollars 400 in mid-93 had not done sustained damage to demand
for gold from jewellers.
He was optimistic the group's loss-making copper mines would ride out the
trough in metal prices.

Brother Industries, the typewriter manufacturer and Japan's largest sewing
machine maker, yesterday reported pre-tax profits for the year to November
20 down 45 per cent to Y603m (Dollars 5m) from Y1.09bn.
The Nagoya-based group said the results had been pulled down by the weak
Japanese and European economies.
Turnover fell to Y144.5bn from Y160.8bn, a drop of 10.1 per cent. Domestic
sales were particularly weak, down 19.5 per cent to Y41.41bn.
Exports, whose value was undermined by the strength of the yen, fell 5.7 per
cent to Y103bn. European demand had been poor, said the company.
Net profits for the year dropped 12.2 per cent from Y826m to Y725m. Earnings
per share fell from Y3.08 to Y2.7.
The group, which initiated a cost-cutting programme in June last year, is
maintaining its dividend at Y7.5 per share for the year. It predicted
pre-tax profits for the 12 months beginning 21 November 1993 of Y1.2bn on
sales of Y131.5bn. Net profits would be Y600m.
Last year Brother transferred production of its portable typewriters from
Japan to the US.

FT  19 JAN 94 / International Company News: Mixed results for Anglovaal gold
mines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MATTHEW CURTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lower gold revenue and a push to increase tonnage by the gold mines owned by
the Anglovaal group brought mixed results in the quarter ended in December,
writes Matthew Curtin. Aggregate after-tax income eased to R67.1m from
R67.5m in the previous three months.
Heavyweight producer Hartebeestfontein turned in a solid quarter to increase
tonnage without sacrificing underground grades. Gold output climbed to
7,342kg from 7,118kg but the combination of lower gold revenue and higher
working costs cut working profit to R102.3m from R107.8m. After-tax profit
rose slightly to R57.5m from R56.3m because of a smaller tax bill and
improved non-mining income.
Loraine, Anglovaal's marginal gold mine, saw working profit crumble to
R2.07m from R4.75m despite an increase in the average gold price received.
Eastern Transvaal Consolidated Mines reported after-tax profit of R6.1m
compared with R4.8m.

FT  19 JAN 94 / International Company News: Bank of East Asia marks
anniversary with 47% surge
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Bank of East Asia, Hong Kong's third largest listed bank, yesterday marked
its 75th anniversary by unveiling a 47 per cent rise in 1993 net earnings to
HKDollars 1bn (USDollars 129m) from HKDollars 685.2m in 1992.
Analysts in Hong Kong had expected the bank to present something special for
its anniversary, but the results published left analysts gasping. The
consensus of expectations was for profits to be about 25 per cent ahead of
the previous year.
Bank of East Asia said that its earnings were supported by stable interest
margins, persistently strong demand for bank loans, and gains in fee-earning
business.
Mr David Li, chief executive, said operations in Hong Kong and China had put
in a very strong performance last year. Offshore operations, with the
exception of the branch in New York, had also performed well.
Mr Li said he expected growing pressure on margins in Hong Kong this year.
He said he expected to see a contraction in interest margins and a
commensurate rise in the cost of bank funds.
Mr Li said, however, that growth in earnings would be stable for banks in
Hong Kong which were expected to rely more on non-interest income than in
the past. This would be the case for Bank of East Asia which would also
benefit from property sales during the year, he said.
Bank of East Asia's explanation of its success over the past year met with
some scepticism among brokers who noted that the result was struck after an
unspecified transfer to secret inner reserves.
According to Mr Steven Li, banking analyst with Jardine Fleming: 'There is
no doubt in my mind that their banking results were not up 47 per cent in
the year.'
He said he thought that earnings from securities trading and property
development helped buoy the result. The transfer the bank made to inner
reserves in 1993 might have been a lot smaller than in 1992.
The bank said it would pay a special cash bonus of 10 HK cents a share. A
final dividend of 62.5 HK cents a share took total dividends for the year to
90 HK cents a share - up 35 per cent on 1992. Directors also recommended a
one-for-four share bonus.

FT  19 JAN 94 / International Company News: Earnings at BCI likely to match
year earlier
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Banca Commerciale Italiana, the Italian bank expected to be privatised next
month, should report 1993 net earnings in line with 1992.
BCI is not due to release figures about last year's performance until a
board meeting next week to examine preliminary parent company results.
However, analysts forecast that net profits for the entire group will not
differ much from the L218.5bn (Dollars 128m) made in 1992.
That prediction, which includes the likelihood of a maintained dividend,
comes despite sharply higher provisions and tax charges in 1993. Last year's
results are also unlikely to benefit from big extraordinary gains.
The loan book at BCI, which lends to some of Italy's biggest companies, has
been badly hit by the recession. Prominent among last year's corporate
casualties was Ferruzzi, to which the bank is believed to have lent about
L600bn.
BCI will also face substantially higher taxes because it has now used all
the extraordinary tax breaks which boosted earnings in recent years.
However, Mr Sergio Siglienti, chairman, said matters were more than
compensated by a sharp rise in fee income, reflected in results for the
first nine months of 1993, when pre-tax profits soared to L585.3bn from
L267.6bn. Fee income had grown 'dramatically,' notably on securities.
Mr Siglienti denied the privatisation would be affected by the general
elections on March 27.
He forecast privatisation would trigger some streamlining of the bank's
structure, with the possible removal of one of the bank's three layers of
holding companies and a closer relationship with the three small retail
banks it controls in Italy.
Internationally, he revealed BCI is negotiating to buy out its partners in
Banque Sudameris of Paris.

<TEXT>
Mr Jean-Pierre Capron, head of RVI, the trucks and buses operations of
Renault, the French state-owned vehicle group, is leaving the company at the
end of next month to take up a new job, Renault said yesterday.
He will be replaced by Mr Shemaya Levy, currently managing director of the
European operations of RVI.
Renault officials said that Mr Capron's departure, which has been rumoured
for several weeks, was not related to the failure of the planned merger
between Renault and Volvo of Sweden.
Mr Capron was not due to form part of the five-member executive board to run
the merged vehicle group and has been linked with a series of posts in
French industry over recent months, including the chairmanship of Bull, the
computer group.
The change at the top of RVI, however, comes at a sensitive time for the
group. The collapse of the merger has removed one of the central elements of
Renault's strategy and has raised questions about the future of industrial
co-operation with Volvo.
The two groups aimed to share the rising costs of product development in
trucks and buses as well as in cars and sealed their alliance through a
series of cross-shareholdings. RVI said that the future of the industrial
alliance would not be clear until discussion with the new management at the
Swedish group.
Mr Capron, who devoted much of his time to developing the alliance with
Volvo, also helped steer RVI through depressed international trucks markets.
RVI, which fell into loss in 1992, is expected to announce another loss for
1993, although industry analysts believe it will be substantially less than
the FFr1.6bn (Dollars 269m) suffered the previous year. Despite the downturn
in the industry, however, RVI said that it managed to increase its share of
the French and European truck market last year.
Mr Louis Schweitzer, Renault chairman, praised Mr Capron who, he said, had
'guided RVI through an unprecedented crisis in the market'. He added that Mr
Capron had implemented a recovery plan at Mack Trucks, the group's US
subsidiary. A Renault spokesman said that the US group was on target to
break even by mid-year.

<TEXT>
Alcan Australia, a 73 per cent subsidiary of Alcan, revealed it had returned
to the black during the second half of 1993, leaving it with a tiny ADollars
772,000 (USDollars 537,342) profit after tax for the full year.
This compares with an after-tax loss of ADollars 15.5m in 1992, and was
reached on sales up 10.5 per cent, at ADollars 636.5m.
However, Alcan said much of this advance was due to sales of metal purchased
from third parties. The underlying increase in revenue from Alcan products
was around 3 per cent last year, with volumes rising by about 2 per cent.
At the operating level, Alcan still showed a ADollars 7.1m loss for the
year, with the second-half profit of ADollars 4.31m failing to outweigh the
first-half deficit of ADollars 11.4m. At the net level, however, the
second-half surplus of ADollars 3.73m was slightly more than the first half
loss of ADollars 2.95m.
Alcan, noting the market remained 'very competitive', said the improvement
stemmed from increased productivity and associated cost reductions. The
overall profitability, it added, came from downstream fabricating businesses
 -especially the extrusion division. By contrast, 'decreasing tariffs and
competition from imports have adversely affected pricing for sheet products
and the profitability of the sheet division'.
The figures include abnormal items of ADollars 6.8m, compared with ADollars
5.3m last time, partly covering redundancy costs and relocation expenses.

McDonald's Corporation, the international hamburger restaurant chain, said
it intends to buy back Dollars 1bn of common stock within the next three
years, funded primarily by excess cash flow.
Since 1983, the company has bought back stock worth nearly Dollars 2.2bn.
Mr Jack Greenberg, chief financial officer, said the repurchases would
enhance shareholder returns, but would not dent the equity base needed to
support future growth worldwide.
McDonald's recently announced that it would accelerate its global restaurant
expansion, constructing 900 to 1,200 new stores annually, with about
two-thirds outside the US. It currently has 14,000 restaurants in 70
countries, with nearly 80 per cent independently owned by local franchisees.

Grupo Financiero Banamex-Accival (Banacci), Mexico's largest financial
group, reported a 35 per cent increase in total profits to 3.59bn new pesos
(Dollars 1.16bn) last year, after a big increase in gains from money-market
and equity trading.
Banacci's profits include 861m pesos of unrealised gains on securities
trading. Banacci said that adjusting for income tax and profit sharing,
profits would be Dollars 3.21bn, 21 per cent up on 1992.
The profits of Banacci's subsidiaries - which exclude the group's unrealised
gains from securities trading - reached 2.68bn pesos last year, just 1 per
cent more than last year. Banamex, the group's bank and largest subsidiary,
reported total net income of 2.36bn pesos last year, 2.5 per cent lower than
1993.
For the fourth quarter, Banacci reported profits, including unrealised
securities gains, of 1.36bn pesos, 39 per cent up on the same period last
year. Banamex achieved profits of 626m pesos, compared with 743m pesos in
the same quarter last year.
It blamed Banamex's drop in profits on Mexico's weak economy last year, lack
of liquidity and its aggressive increase in provisions for loan losses. Last
year Banamex provided for 2.97bn pesos for loan losses.
Mr Stefano Natella of CS First Boston said Banamex's results were positive,
particularly the growth in fee income, the increase in margins, and control
of costs.

Eli Lilly, the US drugs group, announced one-off charges of Dollars 1.2bn
before tax and said it planned to spin off its medical devices and
diagnostics businesses, which account for around 20 per cent of sales.
The moves signal an attempt by Mr Randall Tobias, the former AT&amp;T
vice-chairman brought in to head the company last June, to concentrate
Lilly's resources on its drugs business. Lilly has suffered from imminent
patent expiries on some of its biggest drugs, and a widespread belief that
it will not introduce any significant drugs in the near term.
It is more dependent on the slowing US market - from which it derives
two-thirds of sales - than most of its rivals, and it has been slow in
adapting its sales and marketing activities to the managed care
organisations which are starting to dominate the US healthcare market.
On the decision to spin off the devices and diagnostics businesses, Mr
Tobias said: 'It's a matter of strategic fit and focus - these are very,
very different businesses.'
The stock market applauded the move, pushing Lilly's share price up Dollars
1 3/4 to Dollars 61 5/8 .
The businesses to be shed accounted for estimated sales of Dollars 1.25bn
last year, out of a total of some Dollars 6.4bn. Analysts' estimates put
their value at anything between Dollars 1.5bn and Dollars 3bn.
Lilly said it may float the businesses, sell them, or issue shares in them
to its existing shareholders.
It plans to put six of the nine businesses into a new holding company,
shares in which would be either floated or issued to existing Lilly
shareholders. The outcome would depend on tax considerations, the state of
the stock market, and the attractiveness of any offers for individual
businesses.
The remaining three businesses will also be sold, though the timing will
depend partly on the resolution of undertakings Lilly made when it acquired
the businesses.
Lilly also reported fourth-quarter charges of Dollars 1.2bn before tax, of
which Dollars 540m was the result of a voluntary retirement programme under
which 2,600 people have already left.
It also announced a Dollars 370m charge for rationalisation of some
manufacturing operations and for changes to its 'distribution strategies',
and a Dollars 290m write-down of some manufacturing assets and acquired
intangible assets.

Sun Microsystems, the US market leader in computer workstations, yesterday
reported an 80 per cent rise in second-quarter net income.
The company made Dollars 43.8m, or 46 cents a share, up from Dollars 24.1m,
or 23 cents, a year before, on revenues up 8 per cent at Dollars 1.13bn. The
earnings were broadly in line with market expectations.
Mr Kevin Melia, chief financial officer, said: 'Sun's successful new product
offerings and the resulting strength in the high-end product mix, as well as
our continued focus on cost management, helped increase gross margins from
last year's level.'
For the six months, Sun reported net income of Dollars 60.4m, or 62 cents a
share, up from Dollars 28.9m, or 28 cents, on revenues 10 per cent higher at
Dollars 2.09bn.

Alcan Aluminium, one of the world's biggest producers, blamed the world
aluminium glut for a fourth-quarter loss of USDollars 36m, or 17 cents a
share, including a rationalisation charge of Dollars 25m.
This compares with a loss of Dollars 56m, or 29 cents ,in the 1992 quarter,
including Dollars 49m of special charges. Revenues in the latest quarter
were down slightly at Dollars 1.8bn.
Alcan's loss for the full year was Dollars 104m, or 54 cents, against a loss
of Dollars 112m, or 60 cents. Special charges were Dollars 37m, compared
with Dollars 58m. Revenues were again down slightly, at Dollars 7.23bn.
Mr Jacques Bougie, president, blamed exports from the former Soviet Union
for the overcapacity crisis. LME spot ingot prices touched a new low (after
inflation) of 46 US cents a pound last month. The price has since risen - it
stood at 54.5 cents earlier this week - on hopes of an international deal on
production cuts.
Alcan last week decided to close temporarily another 156,000 tonnes of ingot
capacity in north America, Brazil and the UK. Fabricated product volumes
reached new highs in the fourth quarter and 1993, but prices fell. Ingot
shipments were lower in the fourth quarter but higher for the year. Prices,
however, weakened.
Operating results benefited from cost reductions and lower interest
expenses. The year-on-year losses were reduced in Canada, Latin America and
the Pacific area, but were higher in the US, Europe and elsewhere.

<TEXT>
Standard and Poor's yesterday lowered ratings on Japan's 'big four' brokers,
writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
Senior debt rating at Nomura Securities was lowered to double-A from
double-A plus. Daiwa Securities' short-term debt rating was lowered to A-1
from A-1 plus. Nikko Securities' long-term debt has been reduced to A from
A-plus, while short-term debt at Nikko Europe was cut to A-1 from A-1 plus.
The A-1 short-term rating of Nikko Bank (UK) is under review. Senior debt at
Yamaichi Securities was lowered to A1 from A.
The US credit agency cited the negative impact of low stock market turnover
and limited new equity offerings. It also pointed to continuing financial
liberalisation and the consequent lowering of barriers between the banking
and securities industries. This will increase competition and squeeze the
brokers' profit margins, S&amp;P said.

Ceske Energeticke Zavody (CEZ), the partially-privatised Czech energy group
and one of the country's largest companies, expects pre-tax profits of
Kcs18.5bn (Dollars 620m) for 1993, according to preliminary figures.
Operating revenues are expected to be Kcs49bn, against expenditures of
Kcs30.5bn. There are no comparable figures for 1992.
CEZ is one of the most popular stocks on the Czech market, and considered a
blue-chip investment by foreign analysts. Investment funds and individual
investors secured 33 per cent of the company's stock during the the first
wave of voucher privatisation, completed shortly before last summer.
Another tranche of shares will be sold this year within the second round of
voucher privatisation.
The National Property Fund (NPF), an institution established to oversee
privatisations and manage the state's shareholdings, still holds 67 per cent
of CEZ's share capital. However, Mr Tomas Jezek, NPF chairman, recently
suggested it may reduce its stake to 51 per cent this year.
CEZ has a quasi monopoly of power generation in the Czech Republic - there
are a few small power plants run by municipalities - with no significant
competitor on the domestic market. It has large investment plans to
modernise production and improve environmental controls.
Since trading began in July, the price of CEZ shares has risen dramatically,
from Kcs645 per share to Kcs2,050 at the close on last Thursday's session of
the Prague stock exchange. (The exchange has two sessions a week, on Tuesday
and Thursday.) At that price, the company's market value would be about
Kcs102bn.
Since 1992, the company has spent Dollars 50m from a World Bank loan to help
finance desulphurisation at several power plants. Investment this year is
expected to be Kcs30bn, with Kcs8bn spent on desulphurisation, and about
Kcs11bn on completing the nuclear power plant at Temelin, in southern
Bohemia.
Last year, CEZ exported electricity worth Kcs1.5bn, mainly to Italy and
Austria.

FT  19 JAN 94 / International Company News: Ontario Hydro to write off at
least CDollars 3bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ontario Hydro, north America's biggest power utility, is to take write-offs
totalling between CDollars 2.9bn and CDollars 3.5bn (Dollars 2.63bn), to be
charged against 1993 income.
The write-offs are part of a shake-up which started a year ago following the
appointment of Mr Maurice Strong, former secretary-general of the United
Nations Environment Programme, as chairman.
Mr Strong has cut a swathe through the government-owned utility with the aim
of transforming it from a bureaucratic, financially-stretched organisation
into an operation run along business lines.
Ms Eleanor Clitheroe, chief financial officer, said the charges give the
utility 'a clean slate to proceed with its debt reduction programme'. The
aim is to reduce Hydro's heavy debt burden, currently about CDollars 35bn,
by at least one-third over the next decade.
The write-offs, announced this week, are roughly double the figure projected
six months ago. They include the cost of cancelling long-term uranium
contracts negotiated with Denison Mines and Rio Algom at prices far above
present market levels, and a write-off of surplus generating capacity.
Details of the capacity write-downs have yet to be determined.
Ms Clitheroe said that by taking the write-offs in one lump, Hydro will
boost 1994 income from CDollars 250m to CDollars 600m. Due to lower costs
and improved operating performance, it now estimates its operations
virtually broke even last year, compared with earlier forecasts of a
CDollars 200m operating loss.

FT  19 JAN 94 / International Company News: US banks cast off 1980s debt
problems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Fourth-quarter figures yesterday from a batch of the US's biggest commercial
banks carried a clear message: the industry has moved faster than expected
in putting the bad-debt problems of the late-1980s behind it.
Net income at seven big banks which reported results yesterday either met or
beat analysts' most optimistic forecasts, with Citicorp and Chase Manhattan
producing the biggest earnings surprises.
Less clear, though, is the answer to a question which continues to overhang
bank share prices: how can the banks hope to grow their earnings in future?
According to yesterday's figures, most banks hardly expanded their loan
books last year, and lending margins came under pressure in some cases.
The record profits from trading in foreign exchange and other financial
markets in the middle of last year were not repeated, although trading
income still remains at high.
Citicorp experienced the most marked improvement in asset quality, reporting
a Dollars 571m provision in the fourth quarter, down from Dollars 980m in
the same period of 1992 and taking total provisions for the year to Dollars
2.6bn.
This was a big factor in lifting net income in the fourth quarter to Dollars
575m, or Dollars 1.06 a share, after previously announced one-off items,
which included a restructuring charge of Dollars 445m.
Citicorp's results, broad details of which had been released last week, also
benefited from stronger than expected earnings growth, particularly from its
operations in developing countries.
The consumer banking business in the developing countries reported net
income of Dollars 150m in the fourth quarter, up from Dollars 109m the year
before, while in the developed markets it rose to Dollars 228m from Dollars
154m. Net income from wholesale banking, through the global finance
division, jumped to Dollars 247m from Dollars 117m in the developing
countries, and to Dollars 275m from Dollars 189m in developed markets.
Trading profits slipped during the period, as foreign exchange income fell
to Dollars 158m from Dollars 264m the corresponding period.
Citicorp's strong earnings rebound, which took its profits for the year to a
record Dollars 1.92bn (Dollars 2.2bn after accounting changes), also boosted
its Tier 1 capital ratio to 6.5 per cent, up from 4.9 per cent a year ago.
The results prompted Moody's, the credit rating agency, to announce that it
may upgrade the bank, whose long-term debt is rated A2. The review will
concentrate on the bank's long-term earnings potential.
Chase Manhattan also comfortably exceeded expectations, as fourth-quarter
figures were lifted by profits on disposals of distressed assets. Chase
reported net income for the period of Dollars 313m, or Dollars 1.53 a share,
up from Dollars 169m, or 87 cents, the year before.
Provisions for the year as a whole rose, due to a special Dollars 566m
charge taken early in 1993 against loans held for accelerated sale. These
charges proved over-cautious: the bank made net gains of Dollars 215m in the
fourth quarter of the year from asset sales, which was included as 'other
revenue'.
Income from trading activities rose to Dollars 167m from Dollars 114m in the
same period of 1992, though it remained below the Dollars 186m of the third
quarter. The bank reported that trading in emerging markets securities had
bolstered income in the latest period.
Chase made greater headway during the year than other big banks in
strengthening its net interest margin, though this was in part due to
profits from the sale of Brazilian and Argentine bonds which others reported
as non-interest items. The margin, at 4.33 per cent, would have been 4.15
per cent had it not been for this factor. The net interest margin was likely
to decline in the coming year as short-term US interest rates rise, the bank
said.
Chemical Banking reported fourth-quarter net income of Dollars 347m, or
Dollars 1.23 a share, up from Dollars 197m, or 64 cents, the year before,
putting it ahead of expectations.
The advance was largely due to a rise in non-interest income, due to gains
on Argentine and Brazilian debt and profits on venture capital investments.
These items boosted 'other non-interest income' for the period to Dollars
236m from Dollars 9m, and for the year as a whole to Dollars 710m from
Dollars 190m.
On the other hand, the bank's net interest margin slipped in the fourth
quarter to 3.65 per cent, from 4.01 per cent a year before. This reflected a
higher level of lower-yielding liquid assets, and lower returns on
securities holdings, the bank said.
NationsBank reported net income for the fourth quarter of Dollars 373m, or
Dollars 1.37 a share, up from Dollars 234m, or 92 cents, the year before.
However, its net interest margin came under pressure during the period,
sliding to 3.77 per cent from 4.23 per cent in the previous period and
confirming expectations that lending margins for all banks, which remain at
historically high levels, are likely to fall as competition to lend picks
up.
NationsBank reported loan growth of 10 per cent before acquisitions, pushing
total loans for the year up 16 per cent to Dollars 79bn. As lending margins
declined, return on capital for the year as a whole slipped slightly, to 15
per cent.
BancOne also reported growing loan demand, and that lending margins had
begun to decline somewhat.
Mr John McCoy, head of the Ohio-based bank, said consumer lending had
increased 24 per cent during the year, while commercial lending was up 4 per
cent.
For the year as a whole, lending margins rose to 6.29 per cent, from 5.98
per cent the year before. During the latest quarter, though, the margin fell
to 6.07 per cent, from 6.22 per cent in the third quarter of 1993. Without
the bank's activities in the swaps markets, the margin would have been 5.38
per cent.
Net income for the fourth quarter was Dollars 286m, or 82 cents a share,
compared with Dollars 206m, or 59 cents, a year before.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Chicago Board of Trade and Bloomberg, the financial information group,
are to join forces to provide the CBoT with an electronic foothold in the
huge cash market for US government securities.
The CBoT has highly successful futures and options contracts on US Treasury
bonds and notes, and for the past two years has sought to augment this with
a move into the underlying cash markets.
It has attempted to launch Chicago Board Brokerages, an electronic exchange
for cash instruments. But the venture has yet to receive approval from the
US Securities and Exchange Commission.
The CBoT now hopes to team up with New York-based Bloomberg to offer
electronic government securities trading to its members and member firms on
Bloomberg terminals around the world. Trades would be cleared by another
CBoT subsidiary, the Clearing Corporation for Options and Securities.
The venture would compete directly with New York's established government
securities broker-dealer industry. Before the venture can proceed, the
exchange must first gain status as a registered broker-dealer from the
National Association of Securities Dealers and its securities clearing arm
must also gain SEC approval.
Mr Patrick Arbor, CBoT chairman, met SEC chairman Mr Arthur Levitt last week
and described the meeting as encouraging.

The airline left the market in 1989 when it underwent a Dollars 3.65bn
leveraged buy-out. It narrowly escaped bankruptcy last year by persuading
employees to accept an equity stake in return for labour concessions.

Bowater, the US newsprint manufacturer, saw operating losses rise to Dollars
19.8m in the fourth quarter, up from Dollars 12.5m a year earlier.
During the quarter, the group sold 68,000 acres of landholdings for an
extraordinary gain of Dollars 48.9m. Including the gain, Bowater reported
net fourth-quarter income of Dollars 4.9m, or 12 cents a share. This
compares with a net loss of Dollars 20.9m, or 59 cents, in the fourth
quarter of 1992.
Sales in the latest quarter were Dollars 340.4m, down from Dollars 363.2m a
year ago.
Mr Anthony Gammie, chairman, said sluggish demand and excess consumer
inventories kept prices for newsprint and coated papers depressed. Although
pulp prices declined during the quarter, Bowater has announced price
increases for early 1994.
'We are encouraged by the 2.1 per cent increase in US newsprint consumption
in November 1993, and hope this improvement will continue into 1994. We also
hope that the newsprint price increase announced for March 1 will go into
effect,' Gammie said.
For the year, Bowater recorded a net loss of Dollars 64.5m, or Dollars 1.84
a share, on sales of Dollars 1.35bn, compared with a loss before accounting
charges of Dollars 92.9m, or Dollars 2.64, on sales of Dollars 1.36bn in
fiscal 1992.

FT  19 JAN 94 / International Company News: Grumman to cut 500 jobs in move
to reduce costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Grumman, the smallest US military aircraft maker, yesterday announced plans
to cut its 15m sq ft of factory, office and warehouse space by nearly a
third over the next two years in the latest of a series of cost-cutting
moves.
The plans involve closing all five of its factories on Long Island, New
York, resulting in the loss of 500 jobs from the workforce of 17,900 this
year.
They will also bring a pre-tax charge of Dollars 84m against 1993 profits,
but should cut operating costs by an estimated Dollars 600m over the next
three years.
Grumman said 1993 earnings, excluding the Dollars 84m charge, were expected
to be at least in line with the previous year's Dollars 3.49 a share for
continuing operations. The figures are due out next week.
Like other US defence contractors, Grumman is faced with a declining market
because of shrinking US defence spending. It once made military aircraft
such as the F-14 Tomcat and A-6 Intruder, but the only aircraft it builds
today is the E-2C Hawkeye early warning system.
The company has been trying to counter the loss of defence contract work by
exploiting its systems integration know-how with projects such as the Joint
Stars airborne early warning system, which uses converted Boeing 707s. It
has also been trying hard to cut costs, reducing its workforce from a peak
of nearly 34,000 in 1987.
The biggest component of the latest cost-cutting plan will be the closure of
the historic Calverton aircraft plant on Long Island that makes the E-2C.
Production will move to Grumman's St Augustine plant in Florida by the end
of next year.
Mr Renso Caporali, chairman, said the cuts would leave Grumman better placed
to succeed in a 'shrinking but still substantial' defence market. 'This
restructuring will contribute to long-term earnings and revenue growth,' he
said.

BB Biotech, a Swiss bio-technology investment fund launched last November,
is raising SFr170m (Dollars 114m) in a warrant rights issue.
Mr Martin Bisang, a director of Bank am Bellevue in Zurich which manages the
fund, said the issue was in response to strong demand for the fund's shares.
At yesterday's close of SFr2,830, the shares were at a 7 per cent premium to
net asset value.
BB Biotech, which raised SFr325m in November, is already one of the largest
biotechnology funds. Most of its investment is concentrated in four US
companies: Alza, Amgen, Biogen and Genentech.
Shareholders will receive one warrant for every share held, and two warrants
will entitle the holder to buy one new share at the net asset value on
February 28.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits at Thyssen Industrie, the capital goods division of west
Germany's biggest steel and engineering conglomerate, fell to DM104m
(Dollars 59m) for the fiscal year ending September 30 1993, against DM460m
the previous year.
The company said that while foreign business, especially in the US, was
booming, the continued slump in domestic orders was hampering profits.
Turnover for the year fell by 7 per cent to DM8.1bn. Foreign sales, which
represent 40 per cent of turnover, climbed by 19 per cent but sales in
Germany were down 13 per cent, the company said.
The sharpest drop was in the vehicle spare parts divisions, which represent
about a fourth of the group's turnover.
Other divisions, including engineering products for the energy sector and
chemicals, remained in the black although they also recorded declining
profits.
Orders for the whole group dropped by 9 per cent to DM7.7bn. In Germany,
orders were down 16 per cent against a 21 per cent rise abroad.
The company said it would continue to reduce its workforce in 1994, with a
further 2,400 redundancies planned in Germany. Nearly 4,000 people were laid
off the previous year, bringing the payroll in Germany to 32,430. The group
employs 44,867 people world-wide.

FT  19 JAN 94 / International Company News: Elf earnings plunge to FFr1.1bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Elf Aquitaine, the French oil group to be privatised within the next few
weeks, yesterday announced a sharp drop in net profits last year to FFr1.1bn
(Dollars 186.4m) from FFr6.2bn in 1992.
The results, in line with forecasts made last year by Mr Philippe Jaffre,
chairman, included net exceptional charges of FFr2bn. These were largely the
result of a write-down in some oil and gas assets, mainly in the North Sea,
restructuring costs in the group's chemicals activities and charges against
some financial investments.
The charges partly reflect Mr Jaffre's policy of cleaning up the accounts
and disposing of non-core financial assets ahead of privatisation. The
government is due to launch the sale of most of its 51 per cent stake within
the next few days.
The privatisation of Elf, the largest operation so far in the government's
plans to sell 21 publicly owned groups, is expected to raise between FFr35bn
and FFr40bn. Analysts in Paris are forecasting a price of about FFr380 a
share, compared with yesterday's closing price of FFr408.
The government is planning to retain about 13 per cent of the shares in Elf,
with a further 10 per cent of the group's shares to be reserved by a core of
stable shareholders. These are expected to include some of the country's
largest financial and industrial groups, such as Union des Assurances de
Paris and Renault.
Analysts argue that investors are likely to be encouraged by the prospect of
a recovery in profits at Elf this year. But they caution that improvement
will be gradual given the weak state of the European economy and the fact
that the oil price remains below Dollars 14 per barrel for the benchmark
Brent crude.
In 1993, according to Elf: 'The worsening economic situation, particularly
in Europe and the steep drop in crude oil weighed heavily on the group.'
Refining margins increased slightly, from Dollars 2.8 a barrel to just over
Dollars 3 during the year, but excess capacity, depressed demand and intense
competition in marketing continued to affect the sector. In chemicals,
prices were depressed by reduced demand, while the group's healthcare and
pharmaceuticals division was affected by cuts in public health spending.
The result of these various factors was a fall in operating profits to
FFr6.5bn last year from FFr12bn in 1992. Turnover rose to FFr210bn from
FFr200.6bn in 1992. The group said it would maintain its dividend at FFr13
per share.
The debt burden increased, partly as a result of acquisitions and increased
investments.

FT  19 JAN 94 / International Company News: Meeting on Banesto postponed

<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A meeting between the governor of the Bank of Spain and the chairmen of
Spain's top banks to discuss the future of Banesto was postponed yesterday
as Price Waterhouse, the accounting firm, continued a fresh audit of the
troubled bank.
The central bank had called the chairmen of the main banks - Argentaria,
Bilbao Vizcaya (BBV), Central Hispano (BCH), Santander and Popular - to a
meeting on Friday to discuss a possible restructuring plan for Banesto.
The meeting will take place on Tuesday. Although the central bank would not
comment on the change, one of the banks said it appeared that more data was
required about Banesto before any rescue plan could be discussed in detail.
The Bank of Spain estimated the over-valuation of assets at Banesto at
Pta503bn (Dollars 3.5bn) when it intervened to replace the bank's management
three weeks ago. However, the Price Waterhouse audit is expected to produce
a higher estimate.
Price Waterhouse has been asked to examine Banesto's loans below a threshold
of Pta250m, which was the limit observed by the central bank's inspectors.
This has raised the likelihood of the accounting firm discovering additional
problems.

FT  19 JAN 94 / International Company News: Volvo prepares to elect new
management team
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
An era will be launched at Volvo today. Shareholders will elect a chairman
and board to pick up the pieces left when Sweden's leading manufacturer tore
up a plan to merge with France's Renault, prompting the resignation of Mr
Pehr Gyllenhammar, chairman.
There is little trace of the trauma caused by the anti-merger revolt, at
least among Volvo's shareholders. Volvo's share price has vaulted upwards
since the deal was scrapped as Swedish investors see a resurgence of profits
and wager that the company can carve out an independent future in the motor
industry.
Yesterday, Volvo's most-traded B shares closed at SKr665, up from SKr539 at
the turn of the year. This is a far cry from the lows below SKr400 in the
turbulent weeks before the merger broke down on December 2.
The extraordinary meeting in Gothenberg will confirm Mr Bert-Olof Svanholm
of Asea Brown Boveri, the Swiss-Swedish engineering group, to succeed Mr
Gyllenhammar, who led the company for more than two decades.
He and six others are being proposed for the board by a group of Swedish
institutional shareholders which control more than 40 per cent of Volvo's
voting capital. The group includes the chief instigators of the revolt
against Mr Gyllenhammar and the Renault deal.
The six include Mr Soren Gyll, the chief executive who led a last-minute
management revolt against the merger, and Mr Louis Schweitzer, the chairman
and chief executive of Renault. The French group remains a 10 per cent
shareholder in Volvo and partner in a three-year alliance that the merger
was intended to succeed.
The remaining new members are all heavyweights of Sweden's industrial and
financial establishment: Mr Bjorn Svedberg, president of Skandinaviska
Enskilda Banken and chairman of Ericsson, Mr Per-Olof Ericsson, head of the
engineering group Sandvik, Mr Tom Hedelius, chairman of Handelsbanken, and
Mr Hakan Frisinger, a former Volvo executive and merger critic.
Shareholders will be anxious to hear from Mr Svanholm and Mr Gyll about
Volvo's strategy although Volvo played down expectations of important
announcements. The alliance with Renault must be clarified.
Mr Gyll has said the two companies should work together. But he says the
most ambitious projects, such as plans to develop jointly new models, are
unlikely to go ahead. The question is whether Volvo and Renault can
dismantle their complex cross-shareholdings, and if they do, where Volvo
will turn for a long-term vehicle co-operation deal that it admits it will
need.
Mr Gyll said Volvo would concentrate more closely on its core car and truck
operations, a shift in emphasis away from the diversified portfolio built up
by Mr Gyllenhammar. The speculation in Sweden is that Volvo will move first
to sell non-core assets, such as its investment companies, to raise capital
to finance vehicle developments, rather than opting for a share issue.
Volvo seems to have a breathing space in which the new board can work
through these issues. The fruits of three years of cost-cutting, a steep
fall in the value of the Swedish krona, rising sales of its cars in the US
and signs of a turnround in the home market, have led analysts to predict
1993 profits of around SKr2bn (Dollars 247m), with big profits growth in
both 1994 and 1995.

FT  19 JAN 94 / International Company News: TAP restructure gains approval
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER WISE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LISBON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Lisbon government has approved a restructuring plan for TAP-Air
Portugal, the state-owned airline. The strategy involves injecting Es180bn
(Dollars 1bn) into the debt-ridden company, reducing the workforce by 2,400
people and seeking a foreign partner.
The approval of the plan ends months of speculation over the future of the
airline. Mr Joaquim Ferreira do Amaral, minister for public works, transport
and communications, said: 'The agreement is bad news for many competitors
who predicted TAP would be forced to close down.'
The state will absorb part of TAP's debt by injecting Es180bn into the
company in four tranches over the next four years. TAP's accumulated debt
reached Es124.4bn in 1993 and operating losses rose to Es35bn, the worst
result in the company's history.
Under the plan, TAP is forecast to return to profits in 1996, with a
forecast net profit Es300m, growing to Es12.7bn in 1997. From 1997, when
TAP's debt is forecast to have fallen to Es114.5bn, the company's earnings
should be sufficient to cover its own debt liabilities, according to Mr
Ferreira do Amaral.
The airline's staff level of 9,500 people will be cut to 7,110 by 1997. This
implies the loss of 800 jobs in 1994 compared with forecasts that the
company would dismiss 2,000 workers this year.
TAP will abolish all of its flights to North America except to New York and
will drop flights on 15 or 16 secondary routes in Europe.

Japan Airlines, Japan's largest airline which is struggling to return to
profitability, is reducing its workforce by about 5,000 people over four
years and slashing investment in the period to about half of what it had
planned.
JAL said yesterday it was presenting its unions with a plan to reduce its
workforce of almost 22,000 people to 17,000 by the end of fiscal 1997
through voluntary retirement, curtailment of new hirings and transfers to
subsidiaries.
The airline, which last year reported a Y54.9bn (Dollars 508m) pre-tax loss,
will cut capital expenditure to Y440bn from a planned Y840bn in the next
four years. JAL aims to cut a further Y100bn out of costs in the next fiscal
year. Wages, limited to a 1 per cent increase last year, could be frozen
this year and JAL may not hire new stewardesses for the second year running.
The measures, to be implemented under a four-year restructuring plan, are
aimed at ensuring the company's survival amid a difficult market
environment. JAL has been hurt by a downturn in business and first-class
travel as a result of Japan's economic slowdown, increased competition on
international routes, particularly from lower-cost US airlines and a
high-cost structure.
The move was welcomed on the Tokyo stock market where JAL's share price rose
Y10 on the news to close at Y640.
Cuts in capital spending will range across all areas from aircraft to
investment in facilities at the New Kansai International Airport scheduled
to open in September. Orders for aircraft have been rescheduled so that JAL
will be taking delivery of 28 aircraft, six fewer than planned.
JAL will order smaller aircraft to raise its share of the domestic market.
The company's union representing cabin crew criticised the moves: 'We cannot
accept their plan' which makes employees pay for management failures.

Hagemeyer, the Dutch-based international trading group, said preliminary
results for 1993 show a 20 per cent rise in net profit before extraordinary
items to about Fl 122.5m (Dollars 68m) from Fl 102.2m in 1992.
Total net profit, including a previously reported Fl 42m extraordinary gain
on the sale of land in Singapore, rose by more than 55 per cent to Fl 161m
from Fl 103.1m.
Hagemeyer, which is 63 per cent-owned by First Pacific of Hong Kong, said
sales rose to more than Fl 3.9bn from Fl 3.4bn in 1992, and it predicted a
further rise to above Fl 4.5bn for the current year.
'The upward trend in earnings is expected to continue,' the company said.
Final figures for 1993 are scheduled to be published on February 24.
For 1994, the company expected to book more than Fl 75m in extraordinary
profit from an amicable agreement with Matsushita of Japan that it would
stop importing and distributing the Japanese company's products in
Singapore, starting in April.
Matsushita plans to integrate Hagemeyer's distribution activities for the
National, Panasonic and Technics brands into its own regional marketing and
sales company.

FT  19 JAN 94 / International Company News: Porsche expects profit this year

<TEXT>
Porsche, the luxury sports car maker, will return to profit by Christmas
after three years of heavy losses, according to Mr Wendelin Wiedeking, chief
executive.
Announcing a deficit of DM115m (Dollars 67.6m) for the six months to the end
of January, he said the full-year short-fall would be about DM150m.
The company, which lost more than DM300m in the past two years combined,
would start making decent profits by 1997 at the latest, Mr Wiedeking
claimed. By then its new models, the Boxster two-seater and the 996,
successor to the 911, will be on the market.
The company, which will launch a capital-raising exercise shortly, said
consolidated group equity fell to DM386m last year from DM634m in 1991-92 as
a result of the DM240m net loss. Net liquid assets declined to DM344m from
DM614m.
The Porsche and Piech families which own the group will subscribe to half
the planned DM20m issue in the form of common stock, maintaining their
absolute control, while the balance will come in the form of preferred stock
for other investors. US, Swiss and UK investors held an 'amazing volume' of
preference shares, according to Mr Walter Gnauert, finance director.
Mr Wiedeking based his optimistic forecasts on cost-cutting measures, and an
increase in orders for the new 911 Carrera. Production would rise in the
current year to 16,000 Porsche cars compared with 12,500 last year and more
than 32,000 in 1989-90. The company would build a further 2,000 vehicles on
contract for Mercedes-Benz and Audi.
More than 4,000 orders had been booked for the Carrera since its launch last
autumn. The Stuttgart plant was making 55 a day by the turn of the year and
output would reach the target of 72 a day by March, Mr Wiedeking said.
However, he said production of the four-cylinder 968, popular in the US and
the UK, was 'not in line with our plans' at 12 cars a day, while output of
the eight-cylinder 928 GTS was down to three a day.
In the last full year, to the end of July 1993, the group workforce had been
cut by 15 per cent to 7,100 people, reducing personnel costs by some DM130m.

FT  19 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Dawson Holdings rises to Pounds 3.8m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Dawson Holdings, the international journal distributor, lifted pre-tax
profits from Pounds 3.01m to Pounds 3.83m for the year ended September 30,
on turnover 9 per cent higher at Pounds 119.9m.
However, the company warned that curtailed price increases and the fact that
most efficiency savings had already been made, meant it did not expect to
show an improvement in profits next year.
Dawson said the worldwide library market suffered intense cost pressures.
Despite continued success in integrating units and winning new business in
the EU, the US, the Middle East and China, it did not forecast a real
increase in profit from its traditional businesses next year.
Earnings per share climbed from 55p to 72p and the year's dividend is 26p
(24p) with an unchanged 18p final.

FT  19 JAN 94 / UK Company News: HunterPrint to cut costs in bid to
eliminate losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HunterPrint, the specialist printing company, has embarked on a Pounds 3m
cost-cutting programme in a bid to reduce losses and improve gearing.
The Corby-based group announced the move yesterday after warning that
difficult trading conditions were continuing to hamper its performance.
In the year to September 1993, the company incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds
3.2m, compared with a restated deficit of Pounds 12.2m.
Although the losses represented a substantial upturn on the 1992 results,
the improvement was undermined by an exceptional Pounds 1.2m charge to cover
the cost of disposing of surplus property assets.
Turnover, meanwhile, fell by 3 per cent to Pounds 50.8m (Pounds 52.2m).
Losses per share came out at 6.7p (68p).
The group's difficulties were highlighted by its admission that year-end
borrowing of Pounds 17.9m was higher than expected in spite of cost-cutting
and the completion of two refinancing packages in recent years.
Gearing exceeded forecast levels because the group had invested Pounds 6.2m
in plant and facilities, including three second hand presses.
Mr Tony Caplin, chief executive, said the presses were needed to ensure
capacity for Pounds 10m of new orders to print supplements for Associated
Newspapers, the Guardian Media Group and Mirror Group Newspapers.
Income from the new orders, however, was not generated in time to influence
the 1993 figures.
Printing demand from other customers remained 'low and erratic' as
advertising expenditure continued to decline, Mr Caplin added.
'There is no guarantee of a market recovery in 1994; even with the level and
nature of contract orders, the company remains vulnerable in the current
competitive pricing of spot market work.'
His caution has increased uncertainty over the business, which has failed to
revive its fortunes despite raising Pounds 18.3m through a placing and offer
as part of its last refinancing package in December 1992.
Since then the share price has fallen sharply from a high of 50p. It closed
down 2p yesterday at 25p after the company said it had no distributable
reserves to pay a dividend on either its convertible preference or ordinary
shares.

Denmans Electrical attributed the 33 per cent expansion in annual profits,
announced yesterday, to an all-round improvement across its market areas.
On turnover ahead 7 per cent to Pounds 38.4m, pre-tax profits for the 12
months to end-September jumped from Pounds 1.52m to Pounds 2.03m. Mr Arnold
Denman, chairman, said the sales increase 'represented real growth in a flat
market with no price inflation'.
The shares were marked 55p higher at 528p.
The wholesale operation, expanded since the year-end to 45 branches with the
acquisition of Palmer Riley, made progress amid 'signs that the long
recession in the electrical wholesale market is now ending.'
A proposed final dividend of 4.5p brings the total for year to 6.4p (6.1p),
payable from earnings of 30.74p (23.73p) per share.

FT  19 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Supplying parts to consolidate the market -
Finelist, where a young team is leading the flotation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Distributing automotive parts during a recession sounds a daunting prospect,
but this harsh trading environment has nurtured one of the youngest
executive teams to seek a listing in the current wave of flotations.
Finelist, which will be floated next month with a market value of about
Pounds 25m, is led by Mr Chris Swan, 35, executive chairman. Mr Sadhana
Reddy, the finance director, is another corporate youngster at the age of
33. While a chartered accountant with Peat Marwick he advised Mr Swan when
he took control in 1991, and joined Finelist in early 1992.
However, more City experience comes in the shape of Mr Brian North, a former
executive of Burton and Thorn EMI, who joined as non-executive deputy
chairman in 1992. He is a director of various private and public companies,
including Haden MacLellan and Baris Holdings. The group intends to appoint
another non-executive director and an operations director.
Finelist says it has made rapid progress in a fragmented market by stressing
high levels of service to garages, computerising stock and financial
controls and emphasising staff training and motivation.
The company has 73 outlets, including 25 franchises, trading principally
under the Autela name. About 18 months ago it had 48 outlets.
Turnover has grown from Pounds 11.6m in 1990 to Pounds 16m in the year to
June 30 1993, with operating profits increasing from Pounds 500,000 to
Pounds 1.2m. The prospectus will forecast pre-tax profits almost doubling to
Pounds 2m in the present year to June.
The flotation will raise between Pounds 5m and Pounds 6m of new money, which
will be used for expansion. The group has an initial target of 120 outlets.
Mr Swan, who will own between 15 per cent and 18 per cent of the equity
after flotation, said: 'We are going to expand through acquisition. We could
expand by another 20 sites without materially increasing overheads.'
The first areas identified for expansion are along the M4 corridor, the east
Midlands and the Borders. Last April the group entered west London by paying
Pounds 500,000 for Willow Vale, a chain of five outlets. It hopes to expand
around the M25 using the Willow Vale name, which has also been applied to LH
Codd's four north Devon sites bought last July for Pounds 950,000.
The Autela business was the subject of a management buy-out in 1989 from BBA
Group, which had acquired it with the rest of Automotive Products in 1971.
Mr Swan was part of the initial buy-out team and then took full control with
a second buy-out, backed by 3i and NatWest Ventures, of the other directors.
It offers free delivery of parts in under an hour to customers within seven
miles of a branch. It also offers a no-quibble, 12-month guarantee of any
component, backed by the manufacturer, whether or not the part was faulty.
Mr Swan says: 'The trick is to make significant margin out of it to make it
profitable. We're a service provider and we can charge for it. A garage
owner gets his customer's car off the ramp and will pay accordingly.'
Finelist's gross profit margins have increased from 13.8 per cent in 1990 to
18.6 per cent in 1993, and at the operating level from 4.5 per cent to 7.5
per cent.
It has invested in a Tridex computer system, which provides branches with an
electronic catalogue listing 208,000 component parts. Even inexperienced
staff can, within seconds, establish the availability and customer-specific
price of any part, and any related sales opportunities.
The group does not use a central warehouse, relying on just-in-time delivery
from the manufacturers and its own stocks. The average outlet would hold
30,000-40,000 parts, and can obtain components from anywhere in the group.
It is this industry-wide trend towards computerised stock control, plus the
advantageous terms on which Finelist can buy components from manufacturers,
which convinces Mr Swan that the automotive distribution sector is ripe for
consolidation.
The group estimates that the UK has 2,400 outlets, a quarter of which are
operated by the three national chains - Brown Brothers (part of Dana UK),
Edmunds Walker (part of Unipart) and Partco, an unquoted Coventry-based
group.
Mr Swan believes many family-owned businesses are struggling to compete.
They have to rely on paper catalogues to keep track of the increasing number
of components in demand, which reflects the greater variety of models on the
road.
As well as making more small cash acquisitions, Mr Swan said the group would
be prepared to issue paper for a larger acquisition before the end of year.
BZW is acting as brokers to the flotation, which is being sponsored by
NatWest Markets Corporate Finance.

FT  19 JAN 94 / UK Company News: How to distribute the cash mountains - A
poser facing the regional electricity companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is the kind of predicament which most companies can only dream of. Some
of Britain's electricity distributors have so much money that they do not
know what to do with it.
This week Eastern Electricity, one of the 12 regional electricity companies
in England and Wales, has shown one way by starting to buy back some of the
shares issued when it was privatised, along with the other 11, three years
ago.
This will reduce the company's cash pile, Pounds 90m and growing, and
increase the earnings of the shares which remain in issue. It also pleased
the City which yesterday marked up the company's and the sector's shares.
Further, and more radical, balance sheet restructuring in the sector is
inevitable as companies get to grips with the welcome but complex problems
presented by generating far more profit and cash than the government
imagined at flotation.
At the end of this financial year in March, several of the companies will be
cash positive and the sector as a whole may have net cash.
Changes from April 1995 in regulatory controls covering their distribution
businesses may dent the growth but some analysts believe that, even if the
changes are radical, the companies will continue to generate cash for at
least several years.
Hoarding it would be inefficient. Utility companies with strong, predictable
and safe earnings can afford to have, and would benefit from, higher debt
than most companies. Debt should be even more attractive in times of low
interest rates.
'Many of the recs are over-capitalised,' says one analyst. 'Put simply the
cost of the equity is about 8 per cent, if you assume yield of 4 per cent
and about 4 per cent for real dividend growth. The cost of debt in the
market would be about 7 per cent.'
Mr Bob Turgoose, a partner with Price Waterhouse and a specialist in the
electricity sector, says creating large cash piles is unlikely to be
welcomed by shareholders. 'The recs would begin to look like banks and that
is not what investors have bought shares in them for.
'Providing the companies can invest the money well they will get better
returns elsewhere. Electricity companies could lift their gearing levels
considerably without anyone batting an eyelid.'
The recs' rude financial health stems in part from their unexpected progress
in cutting staff and costs but also from the relatively generous terms on
which they were floated by the government.
'The more complicated a business the better chance it had in the
privatisation process,' says Mr Nigel Hawkins, analyst at Hoare Govett.
'Thus electricity fared far better than water.'
Although Professor Stephen Littlechild, the industry regulator, has
signalled he will considerably tighten price controls in the forthcoming
review, there are doubts about how tough he can be.
'There is strength in numbers,' says Mr Hawkins. 'There will be huge debates
about whether he is treating all the recs fairly but Prof Littlechild would
have bigger problems still if he also adopted a strict approach.
'But to stop positive cash flows he is going to have to be pretty vicious.
Most of the companies have a fair amount tucked away in their back pockets
for future cost reductions.'
Even if the review results in the distribution cash flow drying up, some
analysts believe the recs could still be cash positive overall, in part
because of likely improvements to the supply businesses' debt collection
processes.
The recs have two main options for dealing with their cash surpluses. The
first is to take the familiar but dangerous path of diversification. Finding
areas for investment will not be easy.
Difficulties experienced by some of the water companies in diversifying have
left the market wary. Among utilities, investors tend to favour the
cautious.
Most of the recs have entered or are looking at the gas supply business
following the government's opening up of that market. Some, including
Midlands Electricity, are looking at investing in generation projects abroad
but the opportunities are limited and commitments so far are minimal.
'The problem with cash piles is that they increase pressure to buy something
you may later regret,' says one chief executive.
The second option is to pay back some of the cash to shareholders. Share
buy-backs are the most obvious route. So far East Midlands, which has
permission to buy 5 per cent of its stock, and Swalec are the only companies
to have shareholder approval, and several recs are likely to ask for
shareholder approval at annual meetings later this year.
A simpler payback method would be to increase dividends to shareholders.
That could be achieved by lifting the increases by even more in real terms
than the 6 per cent or so minimal a year that analysts are expecting
post-1995.
But this has its dangers, especially as the next general election approaches
and the chances of a victorious Labour party imposing a windfall profits tax
on electricity companies increases. Some rec executives are therefore
beginning to consider privately a large, one-off dividend.
Unlike Ofwat, the water regulator, Prof Littlechild has raised no objections
to high dividend increases.
However, none of the companies are likely to do anything radical before Prof
Littlechild completes his distribution review. Even Eastern appears to be
merely testing the water, having bought less than 1 per cent of its shares.

FT  19 JAN 94 / UK Company News: ICI India sells fertiliser operations for
Pounds 25m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ICI India, the Indian affiliate of ICI, the British diversified chemicals
group which is undergoing large-scale restructuring, is selling its
fertiliser operations for about Pounds 25m.
The company yesterday announced the move, which followed the disposal of a
49 per cent stake in its polyester fibres business for Pounds 16m last year.
ICI India, 51 per cent-owned by ICI, is responding to pressures created by
the Indian government's economic liberalisation programme, launched in 1991,
which is driving companies to reorganise their activities and concentrate
resources on operations which appear to have the best potential and sell
others.
The fertiliser division is a substantial part of ICI India, accounting for
40 per cent of total turnover of Rs9.8bn (Pounds 209.4m) for the year to
last March. Fibres made up a further 13 per cent. ICI India said the sales
would leave the group free to focus on its remaining business including
explosives, paints and chemical catalysts. No further big disposals were
planned.
The company denied that the disposals showed any lack of confidence in
India's reforms. 'Our view is that the chances mean we must focus on
businesses and really go for the products where we are strong,' said a
senior official.
ICI India is selling the fertiliser business to the GP Goenka group, a
diversified chemicals and agricultural products combine. In addition to the
purchase price, ICI India is to receive outstanding fertiliser production
subsidy payments from the Indian government of about Pounds 20m.
The stake in the fibres operations was sold to companies linked to Reliance
Industries, India's largest chemicals group.

FT  19 JAN 94 / UK Company News: YRM deficit rises to Pounds 1.2m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In his first statement since taking over as chairman of YRM, the building
design consultancy, Mr Tony Hunt unveiled an increase in losses from Pounds
498,000 to Pounds 1.19m pre-tax for the half year to end-October.
Losses per share emerged at 8.15p (2.78p) and the interim dividend is
omitted - 0.5p was paid previously but the final was passed as the full year
deficit reached Pounds 1.98m.
With all areas of business suffering 'extremely difficult' trading
conditions turnover fell from Pounds 7.89m to Pounds 5.5m.
Mr Hunt said, however, that the rebuilding in the City of London had brought
work for most divisions and that in Berlin, instructions had been received
for refurbishment work on a chain of hotels.

FT  19 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Proteus link prompts 42p share price rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Proteus International, the USM-traded computer-aided molecular modelling
group, has signed an agreement with American Home Products to design and
develop bio-logicals and pharmaceu-ticals as animal vaccines and
therapeutics for the global market.
The news prompted a 42p rise in Proteus shares to 472p.
The alliance with AHP, the world's fourth largest pharmaceutical company
ranked by total sales and the third largest in veterinary products, is
intended to be a multi-product joint venture that will con-centrate on a
wide range of potential animal health products - including lytic peptides as
enhancers of and substitutes for current antibiotics.
AHP has an animal health product range of some 200 products. It had total
sales of about Dollars 8bn (Pounds 5.4bn) in 1992, of which Dollars 4.5bn
was in human and animal pharmaceuticals.
Under the terms of the agreement Proteus becomes the research arm of Fort
Dodge Laboratories, the centre of AHP's animal healthcare activities.
At present, the worldwide market for surgical neutering of dogs and cats
alone is over Dollars 700m a year. Proteus's immunocastration product, which
will be available through AHP, could 'greatly increase' the size of this
market.

FT  19 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Lookers shares leap as profits treble to
Pounds 5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Lookers leapt 31p to 229p yesterday as the Manchester-based motor
dealer announced pre-tax profits more than trebled in the year to September
30.
Profits expanded from Pounds 1.63m to Pounds 5.01m on turnover up from
Pounds 332.7m to Pounds 363.3m.
Mr William Martindale, chairman, said that the main engine of growth was the
increased level of new and used cars sales in the volume car segment. The
agricultural division continued to recover strongly, he added, since the
devaluation of the green pound.
Lookers' sales of new cars - at about 17,500 - represented a 20 per cent
advance over last time: this in turn was 8 percentage points higher than the
national increase of 12 per cent. Sales of used cars - at about 15,000 -
represented a rise of 14 per cent over last time.
Mr Martindale said that in the case of both new and used cars, margins had
risen. He said that his salespeople had 'worked really hard' and that there
had been many promotions to achieve the sales. Further, the group had
managed to prevent the overhead level rising.
Car prices would not rise in the UK, said Mr Martindale, while the current
competition persisted. With the Continent in recession, the UK was the only
expanding car market and therefore was targeted by all manufacturers.
Lookers has 10 Vauxhall franchises, and nine Rover. Among others, it also
has four Nissan, three Ford, VAG, Renault and Toyota, and two Seat, Hyundai
and Land Rover.
The profit included a Pounds 452,000 surplus from the sale of 51 per cent of
Lookers Planned Motoring, the contract hire business, to Woodchester Credit
Lyonnais, Lookers' 29.8 per cent shareholder.
Earnings vaulted to 12.3p (0.1p) per share and the final dividend is lifted
to 4.5p (4.2p) for a 6.5p (6.2p) total.

FT  19 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Zeneca to build plant in China
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Zeneca announced plans yesterday to build a Dollars 40m (Pounds 27m)
herbicide plant in China. The company has signed a memorandum of
understanding with China's Chemical Industry ministry and is now looking for
a site and a joint venture partner.
Zeneca, which demerged from ICI last year, said it expects the plant to be
on stream by the start of 1996. It will be able to make 3,000 tonnes
annually of Paraquat, the active ingredient in some of the company's
herbicides.
Zeneca does not reveal its world output of the chemical, but the new plant
would join others in the UK, US, Brazil, Japan, Thailand and Malaysia. A new
UK plant is planned to produce 8,000 tonnes a year.
China is one of the fastest growing markets with demand for non-selective
herbicides such as Paraquat having doubled in the past four years.
'Rising prosperity in China will increase the demand for food in terms of
both quantity and quality,' said Mr Gordon Barker, business director of
Zeneca Agrochemicals. 'This demand will be met by greater use of modern
methods of agricultural production.'
This is the second announcement in a week by Zeneca of expansion in China.
On January 13 it announced the launch of its diprivane anaesthetic.
Wood Mackenzie, the stockbroker, estimates the world market for paraquat at
Dollars 460m a year.

<TEXT>
Alexanders Holdings, the Glasgow-based Ford main dealer, achieved a pre-tax
profit of Pounds 512,000 for the year to end-September, against a deficit of
Pounds 691,000.
The recovery was struck on turnover down from Pounds 88.8m to Pounds 87.2m,
and provided the first tangible evidence of improving fortunes for the
company, according to Mrs Aleksandra Clayton, chairman.
Alexanders' Ford main dealerships raised total new vehicle sales by 6 per
cent over the previous year, while the parts operations continued to
strengthen.
Used vehicle sales, however, suffered from the general collapse of prices
during the last quarter of 1992.
A single dividend of 0.5p (nil) is proposed, payable from earnings per share
of 1.25p (1.39p losses).

FT  19 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Stanley Leisure jumps 52% and calls for
Pounds 21m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stanley Leisure, the betting shops and casino chain, yesterday announced a
52 per cent rise in interim pre-tax profits and launched a rights issue to
raise Pounds 21.1m net of expenses.
The proceeds of the issue will be used to reduce borrowings and enable the
group to take advantage of further acquisition opportunities.
Mr Leonard Steinberg, chairman, said the group was moving up from the
'second division to the first division' in its markets. He pointed out that
there were 40 chains of 10 or more betting shops, with a total of some 1,000
shops, which could become takeover targets.
Stanley's pre-tax profits rose to Pounds 5.36m for the six months to October
31, compared with Pounds 3.53m. Turnover increased from Pounds 108.5m to
Pounds 131m.
The group now claims to be the fourth largest UK bookmaker, with 401 shops
following last year's Pounds 6m acquisition of the Selwyn Demmy chain. It
also has 18 casinos, making it the third biggest UK operator.
The cash call will comprise the issue 7.98m new shares at 275p a share on a
3-for-17 basis underwritten by Hambros. Brokers to the issue are de Zoete &amp;
Bevan.
Mr Steinberg will not take up his rights entitlement. That will reduce his
holding in the company from 30.4 per cent to 25.9 per cent of the enlarged
share capital.
Group borrowings were Pounds 35.5m on December 19, giving gearing of 36.7
per cent. After the rights issue, borrowings will be reduced to Pounds
14.5m, and gearing to 15 per cent.
The shares closed yesterday at 333p, down 2p.
The average stake at the betting shops rose by 7 per cent, from Pounds 3.42
to Pounds 3.66. Figures for the division were helped both by acquisitions
and by the introduction of evening opening at the betting shops, the group
said. Average spend in the casinos rose to Pounds 86 (Pounds 82).
Earnings per share rose from 5.48p to 8.34p. An interim dividend of 1.75p
(1.52p) is declared. The group also forecast a final dividend of 3.5p,
making a 5.25p (4.32p) total for the year ending May 1.
COMMENT
Stanley Leisure may be in the gambling business, but there is little of the
gambler in this management which has made slow but sure progress in a tricky
sector. Mr Steinberg is quick to stamp on any suggestion of more ambitious
expansion plans, but the rights issue will put the group in a strong
position to continue with the acquisition policy that has stood shareholders
in good stead so far. Full year profits of Pounds 11m would put the group on
a p/e of 20 - not cheap, but probably a safe bet.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Windsor, the insurance broker which specialises in sports, leisure and
contingency insurance, yesterday announced a 75 per cent increase in
operating profits for the year to September 30, but incurred pre-tax losses
of Pounds 1.11m after provisions and charges of Pounds 1.82m.
Losses per share - reported under FRS 3 - were 3.93p against earnings of
1.69p.
Some Pounds 1.7m in provisions were incurred as a result of writing down the
market value of an investment property - a 25,000 sq ft office block - in
Hemel Hempstead to Pounds 1.5m.
Windsor has now lost more than Pounds 2m on the property which it acquired
in 1989.
Mr Mike Eagles, chief executive, who has headed an extensive reorganisation
since he joined the group in 1991, said he was now confident about selling
the property.
He pointed to a strong underlying growth in business, especially in areas
like professional indemnity, and a 10 per cent growth in revenues to Pounds
8.4m.

Fortune Oil, the London-quoted energy company partly owned by Chinese state
interests, has entered into a Pounds 5.5m joint venture to sell liquefied
petroleum gas in southern China.
The 25-year agreement is with ZGC, a local gas company in Zhanjiang, a
coastal city of some 3m inhabitants in Guangdong province, which borders
Hong Kong. Vitol Energy, one of Fortune's main shareholders, is also
involved. Fortune's share of the investment will be about Pounds 1.5m.
The company was created last year via the acquisition by Blackland Oil, a
former USM company, of Kingsleigh Petroleum of Hong Kong. It was the London
market's first 'red chip' company with direct Chinese state ownership.

FT  19 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Siemens UK sees recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK subsidiary of Siemens, the German electronics giant, forecast a
strong recovery in profits this year, in contrast to last week's surprise
warning from the parent company of a fall in profits of up to 15 per cent
worldwide.
UK sales of semiconductors were up 60 per cent last year, in the context of
a market increase of 40 per cent, said Mr Juergen Gehrels, UK chief
executive. 'Semiconductors are an economic indicator, an early warning
system,' he said. 'This is further proof that the UK is coming out of
recession.' In the first quarter of the current year, semiconductor sales
had doubled.
In the year to end-September, Siemens UK achieved its target of Pounds 1bn
sales, 14 per cent up on the year before. Including the completion of the
Killingholme power station, valued at Pounds 245m, sales reached Pounds
1.25bn. The UK operation was marginally profitable overall, Siemens said,
before including profits from its minority holding in the GPT
telecommunications business.
Mr Gehrels said some divisions had remained in loss, including Siemens
Plessey Systems and the Osram lighting business. However, the Siemens
Nixdorf computer business returned to profit. All divisions would be in
profit this year, he said.
ACT Group has sold ACT Cablestream, its network communications solutions,
products and services business, to Siemens UK.
The sale fits in with the group's strategy to focus on its financial
software products and software and services activities.
Consideration is Pounds 5m, of which Pounds 4.5m was paid on completion with
an adjustable balance, relating to net assets, of up to Pounds 2.5m.

The consideration is made up of an initial Pounds 3.5m cash and a further
profit-related Pounds 700,000.
Part of the initial payment will be satisfied by a vendor placing of 2.1m
shares at 149p each to raise about Pounds 3.1m, before expenses.
Bradstock is raising a further Pounds 3m by a placing of 2m shares, again at
149p. A large part of the proceeds will be used for repayment of Yarrow
Young's debt.
Both placings have been underwritten. Bradstock shares closed 3p lower at
153p.
In total, shares to be issued will amount to about 7.5 per cent of
Bradstock's existing share capital. It is expected that the effect of the
acquisition and placings on earnings per share in the year to September 30
1994 will be broadly neutral.
In the year to May 31 1993 Yarrow Young reported turnover of Pounds 2.6m
(Pounds 2.5m) for pre-tax profit of Pounds 176,000 (Pounds 61,000). Net
liabilities at the end of the period were Pounds 1.9m.

FT  19 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Last significant US asset of MCC sold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Price Waterhouse, joint administrators to Maxwell Communication Corporation,
yesterday agreed the sale of Standard Rate &amp; Data Service, the last of MCC's
significant assets in the US.
Standard Rate &amp; Data, which has annual turnover of between Dollars 30m
(Pounds 20m) and Dollars 35m, is the market leader for finding and pricing
advertising space in US newspapers and magazines and on radio. The price is
thought to be between Dollars 50m and Dollars 70m.
Price Waterhouse has signed a letter of intent with a group of private
investors, who will be financed in part by Continental Illinois Venture
Corporation. They hope to complete the deal by the end of March.
The sale will bring the total realised from MCC's US assets to more than
Dollars 1.5bn.
Mr Alan Jamieson, one of the joint administrators, said Price Waterhouse
would be writing to all MCC creditors setting out the detailed realisations
and dividend prospects.
He said the latest sale had helped to knock the bottom off the 22p-43p in
the pound range estimated last year. An additional 9p could emerge from
successful litigation.

FT  19 JAN 94 / Chrysler beats all forecasts at Dollars 777m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Chrysler, the US carmaker enjoying strong growth in market share with the
help of popular new products, yesterday reported that fourth quarter
earnings had more than doubled, easily beating Wall Street expectations.
The smallest of Detroit's Big Three manufacturers, and the first to report
year-end figures, had net earnings of Dollars 777m, or Dollars 2.11 a share,
compared with Dollars 356m, or Dollars 1.12 a share, in the same period of
1992. Sales for the quarter totalled Dollars 12bn, up from Dollars 10.2bn.
The mean Wall Street forecast was for earnings per share of about Dollars
1.60. Chrysler shares rose Dollars  3/4 to close at Dollars 62 1/2 .
The results underscore Chrysler's remarkable recovery since the early 1990s,
when it was financially stretched, losing market share and entering a
recession, with its shares hovering at little more than Dollars 10.
Its turnround is due to tight control of costs, more efficient methods of
developing products, and a range of new vehicles, including the Jeep Grand
Cherokee and the sleek LH series of family-sized saloon cars.
The company now makes substantially more money per vehicle in North America
than Ford Motor, while General Motors is losing money in the region.
Chrysler said yesterday its pre-tax profit per vehicle averaged Dollars
1,335 in 1993 and Dollars 1,727 in the fourth quarter.
Chrysler's North American car and light truck market share rose to 14.8 per
cent in 1993, up from 13.4 per cent in 1992, while its sales increased 19
per cent to 2.27m units. The company has only a small presence outside the
US, but its international sales rose 45 per cent to 106,000 units, helped by
increased European sales of mini-vans and Jeeps.
Mr Robert Eaton, chairman, said Chrysler's priority was to keep up its
momentum. It still faced important challenges. 'The economic recovery in the
US continues at a slow pace and our balance sheet still is not where we want
it to be.'
Chrysler reported a full-year net loss of Dollars 2.55bn, or Dollars 7.62 a
share, after taking Dollars 5bn of charges for changes in methods of
accounting for employee benefits. At a pre-tax level, 1993 profits totalled
Dollars 3.8bn, compared with Dollars 934m, and the previous record of
Dollars 2.4bn set in 1984.

FT  19 JAN 94 / MAI bids Pounds 292m for Anglia TV
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The consolidation of ITV into larger more powerful groupings continued
yesterday with MAI's agreed Pounds 292m bid for Anglia Television. MAI, the
financial services and marketing group, controls Meridian Broadcasting,
which covers the south of England.
The bid - which sent Anglia's shares up 180p to 664p yesterday - is the
third for an ITV company since November 24, when National Heritage secretary
Mr Peter Brooke first proposed relaxing the rules on ITV ownership. The
three bids, including the hostile Granada bid for London Weekend Television,
have totalled more than Pounds 1.75bn in cash and shares.
If Granada takes over LWT, it means that three men - Mr Michael Green of
Carlton Communications whose offer for Central has gone unconditional, Mr
Gerry Robinson, chief executive of Granada, and Lord Hollick, chief
executive of MAI - will dominate the ITV system. Together the three enlarged
groups would account for about 70 per cent of total ITV advertising.
Sir Peter Gibbings, Anglia's chairman, said: 'It was not if but when (the
company would be taken over) and by whom - the most important of all.'
A takeover by MAI has been likely since Anglia rejected a joint deal with
LWT to take over Yorkshire-Tyne Tees, splitting the target's two licences.
MAI's Pounds 292m bid values each Anglia share at about 637p. For each share
it is offering 357p in cash and 2.667 new MAI convertible preference shares,
with a cash alternative. Anglia shareholders will be entitled to receive a
second interim dividend of 8p.
The deal pushed up share prices in other ITV companies. Carlton rose 39p,
Central 67p and Scottish 25p.
Both Mr Robinson, of Granada, and Sir Christopher Bland, chairman of LWT,
took comfort from the MAI-Anglia deal.
'There is going to be consolidation. There are going to be big blocks and
LWT on its own is not going to be one of the major players,' said Mr
Robinson, who may have to improve the terms of Granada's bid, currently
worth about Pounds 670m.
Sir Christopher commented: 'It's greatly to our advantage. Granada now has
no chance of success at today's price.' The LWT chairman pointed out that
the revaluation of ITV shares continued and there was now one fewer company
to buy.
Attention may now move to the remaining free-standing ITV companies of any
size: Scottish and HTV, the ITV company for Wales and the west.
Yorkshire-Tyne Tees may only be interesting to a predator outside the ITV
system because it owns the maximum of two licences.
MAI's enlarged broadcasting division will be chaired by Lord Hollick. Mr
David McCall, who will remain chief executive of Anglia, will be deputy
chairman and join the MAI board.
Lord Hollick said: 'We will be looking right across the range of the
business to achieve savings.' However, any job losses are likely to be in
areas such as administration, with programme production expanded.
Rather like the Carlton-Central takeover, the MAI-Anglia deal brings
together a publisher broadcaster in Meridian, which commissions rather than
makes its programmes, with a studio-based producer.
MAI is also talking to Time Warner, of the US, over a possible bid for the
UK's new national Channel 5.

FT  19 JAN 94 / BTR to raise Pounds 66m by Canadian stake sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BTR, the industrial conglomerate, is to raise about Pounds 66m from the sale
of its 59 per cent stake in Hawker Siddeley Canada, as it continues to
refocus on its core industrial manufacturing businesses.
This follows the disposal in recent months of two wholesale and distribution
companies for a total of Pounds 245.5m, and the announcement of the
flotation of Graham Group on the London Stock Exchange.
Hawker Siddeley Canada, part of BTR's Pounds 1.55bn acquisition of the
Hawker Siddeley group in late 1991, is involved in businesses ranging from
industrial maintenance and transportation leasing to mining contracting and
some manufacturing.
BTR said the company no longer fitted into its strategy of focusing on pure
industrial manufacturing, currently accounting for about 85 per cent of
sales.
BTR owns 4.82m ordinary shares in Hawker Siddeley Canada, a Toronto-listed
company. The shares will be sold through a fully underwritten placement led
by RBC Dominion, at a price to be finalised shortly. Based on Monday's
closing price of CDollars 27, the placement will raise CDollars 130m.
Mr Alan Jackson, BTR's chief executive, said the Canadian subsidiary had
shareholders' funds of CDollars 240m and no borrowings, apart from
non-recourse debt from its leasing operations.
Analysts believe the latest sale should end an aggressive run of disposals,
which has left the group with a clearer structure and a stronger balance
sheet.
BTR had gearing estimated at 60 per cent in December 1993. With the cash
proceeds from the flotation of Graham Group, the sale of Hawker Siddeley
Canada and the exercise of 1993-1994 warrants, this figure could fall to
around 40 per cent this year. The management demonstrated its comfort with
current gearing levels in December through the purchase of US manufacturer
Rexnord for Dollars 420m (Pounds 283m) cash plus the assumption of Dollars
400m debt.
The group's share price closed 9 1/2 p higher at 374p.

FT  19 JAN 94 / British Gas issues first 50-year Eurobond
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Gas yesterday issued the first ever 50-year Eurosterling bond,
taking advantage of low long-term UK interest rates.
The company's decision to issue extra-long bonds was motivated by its desire
to offer a novel investment vehicle to yield-hungry investors while securing
low funding costs for itself, according to Mr Arthur Burgess, British Gas's
treasurer.
'Long UK interest rates are around their lowest levels for the last 30 years
and we wanted to lock in those low rates for the long term,' said Mr
Burgess. He believes long-term rates are close to bottoming, and while UK
gilt yields may still slip further, 'issuing spreads (relative to gilt
yields) will probably widen out, so corporates won't be able to issue much
more cheaply than they can now'. He said the maturity was also chosen for
its novelty value. 'We could have tapped the 25 or 30-year sector, but we
preferred to go further out on the yield curve to distinguish ourselves from
competing paper,' he said.
The main buyers of the bonds were UK life insurance companies and pension
funds which like to match their long-term assets and liabilities. Some
overseas demand for the paper was also reported, with investors attracted by
the relatively high yields compared with government and corporate bonds in
other European markets, as well as scope for further sterling appreciation.
British Gas issued Pounds 200m of 7 1/8 per cent bonds maturing in February
2044 via CS First Boston. Buoyed by the gilt market rally, but also by
strong investor demand, the bonds ended the day at 99.40 bid, well above
their 98.74 re-offer price, yielding 49 basis points over the long gilt due
2017.
Many observers expect more long-dated bond issues in the near future. 'The
risk for borrowers is that, if they wait too long, they may miss an
opportunity to lock in low funding rates,' said a market analyst at a London
investment bank. Following the successful British Gas issue, he expects to
see 'a few more copycat issues from UK companies, though they have to be
very strong double-A rated names'. British Gas is rated AA2 by Moody's and
AA-plus by Standard &amp; Poor's.

FT  19 JAN 94 / Dubious statistics for cross-border travel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Investors are crossing borders at an unheard of rate, but how far should
they go in diversifying their portfolios? At the moment US pension funds,
for instance, appear to be in the process of implementing a major shift in
their overseas equity exposure, which may have risen by 3 percentage points
last year to 8 or 9 per cent. If they want to raise their exposure to 15 per
cent the present outflows could persist for another two years.
If investors everywhere were to invest in each others' markets, the flows
would more or less cancel out. But at the moment the US is in the lead and
is swamping smaller markets, while many continental European countries
restrict their institutions' overseas exposure to modest proportions like 5
and 10 per cent.
British institutions have been seriously travelling this global road for
longer than the Americans. When foreign exchange controls were abolished in
1979 the overseas exposure of UK pension funds was about 5 per cent, but it
soon reached 15 per cent and each consensus target appears to have been
pushed higher. The end-1993 exposure, including foreign currency bonds, was
almost 30 per cent.
A recent paper from Foreign &amp; Colonial suggested that the exposure should
climb further over the next 20 years, to 40 per cent. Well, you would expect
a global manager to say something of the sort. But the UK investor in
equities might notice that the return on the domestic market over the past
10 years has exceeded that seen externally by a significant margin - an
annual average of 18.7 against 14.4 per cent. Is global investment such a
good idea?
There are all sorts of justifications for investing overseas. US mutual fund
investors have been succumbing over the past year or so to the most basic
motive of chasing the highest short-term returns. Institutional investors
are more strongly influenced by statistical arguments based on risk and
return: diversification across markets which have low correlation can reduce
volatility for a given rate of return.
However, the mathematics does not give a consistent answer. Over the past 10
years the evidence suggests that a minimum risk UK institutional equity
portfolio would have 70 per cent in the UK and 30 per cent overseas. But
over 20 years the answer is quite different, indicating an overseas
weighting of no less than 80 per cent. There is also the problem that the
major markets are likely to be much more closely correlated in future,
precisely because of greater overlap of investors.
The fund manager Paul Woolley developed a matching theory whereby pension
funds should seek a currency exposure comparable to the imported proportion
in the basket of goods consumed by the typical pensioner. Although the fine
print of this was hazy, it supported the principle that investors in small
countries should naturally seek a much higher overseas weighting than their
counterparts in large countries which are economically more self-sufficient.
Now F &amp; C is putting forward yet another argument, a growth-chasing one.
Pension fund investors should concentrate upon high growth 'emerging
markets' to which they should commit perhaps 20 per cent of their assets,
while severely deweighting mature economic regions such as continental
western Europe. But although this argument may look just about respectable
during the latest emerging markets boom, scheme sponsors may worry about
crashes and revolutions.
In any case, fixation on national markets and indices is surely a trap. What
matters in the long run is the source of the dividends and earnings growth.
From the point of view of international exposure, is there much difference
for a US investor between shareholdings in, say, Exxon and Royal Dutch?
Surely portfolio theory should focus on where the underlying profits are
generated rather than on where the shares are listed. Shares should become
differentiated more logically, between big international blue chips and
generally smaller capitalisation domestic companies, more directly
responsive to local economic conditions.
On the basis of underlying earnings British institutional equity portfolios
already have an overseas exposure of around 40 per cent. But admittedly,
little of it is in those currently exciting emerging markets.

FT  19 JAN 94 / Death toll mounts as LA counts quake cost: Louise Kehoe
tours a city afraid to go home
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It wasn't the 'Big One' that California has been dreading - but that was no
comfort to the thousands of Los Angelenos who spent Monday night in tent
cities that sprang up in parks and open areas of the San Fernando Valley, to
the north-west of the city.
For many yesterday, going home was not an option. At least 1,000 buildings
are believed to have been structurally damaged, making them uninhabitable.
Interiors have been wrecked in thousands more.
Although basic services have been restored to some areas, about 300,000
homes are still without electricity and 100,000 have no running water.
Telephones that went dead after the initial quake are working again in most
areas, but services remain limited, with local calls especially difficult.
It is fear, however, that is keeping many people from their homes.
Aftershocks come by the minute. Most are mild tremors but some, such as the
4.7 roller that hit in the middle of yesterday morning, rock buildings and
rattle windows. The jolts may continue for days or weeks.
'We could sleep in the apartment tonight, but we're not taking the risk,'
said Mr Juan Magallanes, who drove his van on to the baseball diamond at a
local park. The Red Cross and others have set up dozens of shelters in
schools and recreation centres, providing camp beds, food and bottled water.
The White House said President Bill Clinton would visit the affected areas
today.
The death toll yesterday had risen to 34, with uncounted thousands of
injured. In Northridge, 20 miles north-west of the city centre and at the
epicentre of Monday's pre-dawn quake, 16 people died in the Meadows
apartment building. 'All the bodies we found were in bed. They didn't have a
chance to wake up,' a city firefighter said at the scene. The National Guard
and police stood guard outside the wrecked building yesterday morning,
deterring sightseers.
A dusk-to-dawn curfew was loosely enforced across the city on Monday night
and about 75 people were arrested for crimes such as looting. 'We were
prepared for a whole lot (of trouble) but we didn't get it,' the police
department said.
Schools remained closed and police chief Willie Williams called on
businesses to close to reduce traffic on damaged highways. However, roads
from the San Fernando Valley to the city centre were jammed as commuters
struggled to find alternative routes.
Skyscrapers in the city centre were barely damaged by the quake and tourist
attractions such as Disneyland and Universal Studios were also unscathed.
In the worst-hit San Fernando Valley, residents swapped stories of narrow
escapes and courageous rescues. 'Three homes collapsed on the next hill,'
said Mr Neil Dickson, an actor who lives in Studio City. 'Our neighbours
across the street dragged the people out alive, but they have nothing left.'
At the Northridge shopping centre, a multi-storey car park collapsed,
crushing a maintenance worker. Freeing him, which took nine hours, became a
television drama adding to the intensity of 24-hour coverage carried by
several stations.
Unlike Hollywood productions, however, this drama has no neat ending.
Picking up the pieces in Los Angeles will be a lengthy process. Many
quake-weary residents have yet to find the energy to begin.

FT  19 JAN 94 / Pro Ned sold off to European headhunting company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pro Ned, the Bank of England-backed organisation which encourages the
appointment of corporate non-executive directors, has been sold to a leading
European headhunting firm and to its own management.
The Bank, which has been the prime sponsor of Pro Ned along with the
Confederation of British Industry, the Institutional Shareholders Committee
and the London Stock Exchange among others, will no longer be involved in
specific projects to improve the governance of UK companies.
'All of those broad areas of corporate governance we still believe in,' a
Bank spokesman said. 'Achieving that goal through this particular
organisation is less overwhelming than it was 10 or 12 years ago.'
Egon Zehnder International, based in Zurich, is to be the new owner of Pro
Ned along with the organisation's three managing directors. Sir Adrian
Cadbury will remain as chairman for a further year but will not become a
partner.
Demand for independent non-executive directors on corporate boards has
increased since the recommendations of a committee headed by Sir Adrian were
released. The report suggested that each board have at least two
non-executives independent of management.
Last August, the Bank of England is said to have approached several
executive search firms about a possible purchase of Pro Ned.
Although Pro Ned has a high public profile because it has championed the
cause of corporate governance, it has failed to market its search services
as do commercial executive search firms. It has also suffered from the image
of an inbred organisation. 'It has always been thought of as a 'jobs for the
boys' organisation,' said one of its sponsors.
The sponsors chose Egon Zehnder because it seemed to have the 'culture and
fit' and had pledged to continue to promote a role for non-executive
directors of UK and European companies. It will also maintain modest fees
for small and medium-sized companies seeking independent non-executives.

FT  19 JAN 94 / Peers warn Howard of need for changes to police bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN and KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government was warned last night that it faces embarrassing defeats in
the the House of Lords unless it initiates radical changes in the bill to
improve the effectiveness of magistrates' courts and the police.
Lord Taylor of Gosforth, the Lord Chief Justice, led demands for amendments
to proposals in the police and magistrates' courts bill to subject
magistrates' clerks to fixed contracts and performance-related pay. He said
this could have 'no place' in a judicial context.
Viscount Whitelaw, a former Conservative home secretary, was joined by Lord
Callaghan, the former Labour prime minister, in attacking provisions which
could open the way for a nationally controlled police force.
In a BBC interview, Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, said he had 'listened
with care' to the criticisms made by the Lords but held out no prospect of
significant concessions.
Lord Whitelaw looked for the changes which would 'inevitably' be made to the
bill to produce a measure likely to attract cross-party support.
Lord Callaghan told Lord Mackay of Clashfern, the Lord Chancellor, that to
secure cabinet approval for the changes required by the Lords he would have
to battle hard against Mr Michael Howard, 'a wilful and ambitious home
secretary'.
Opening the second reading debate, Lord Mackay dismissed as 'groundless'
fears that it would lead to the independent advice given by magistrates'
clerks being undermined.
Ominously for the government, his assurances made little impression on Lord
Taylor, who described the provision authorising the appointment of new
officials to manage the offices of justices' clerks as 'chilling'. He
maintained that the government's decision to include words in the bill
proclaiming judicial independence could not constitute a guarantee, even if
printed in capital letters.
He said peers would be failing in their duty if they allowed a bill to pass
which gave the impression that the advice magistrates received, or the
judicial decisions made by their clerks, were no longer a matter of their
own discretion.
Lord Whitelaw underlined the importance of maintaining public confidence in
the impartiality of the police and condemned the provision enabling the home
secretary to appoint the chairman of each police authority.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
British Gas's 50-year sterling bond issue looks like a clever piece of
opportunism. The government has been unwilling to issue long-dated gilts,
leaving life insurers hungry for assets which are a match for very
long-dated liabilities such as deferred pensions. Yet 50-year liabilities
are few and far between for even the largest life office. That points to
strictly limited demand for similar securities. With gilt yields the lowest
for a generation, though, other companies must be tempted to try their luck.
After all, Walt Disney persuaded US investors to suspend their disbelief
last year and lend it money for a full century.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Rumblings in the undergrowth have put pressure on British Aerospace's shares
recently, though it is hard to see why. The company was always likely to
rationalise its turbo-prop aircraft operations once new banking covenants
were in place. So announcing a Pounds 200m write-off to pay for the
reorganisation along with BAe's full-year figures would cause little real
surprise. Equally, the apparently dashed hope of a new European transport
aircraft is little more than a rather unlikely kite which has been flying
for some time.
More plausibly, fund managers are simply taking profits in one of last
year's most spectacular recovery stocks. Yet looking a little further out,
there are reasons to be optimistic. The low point of the defence orders
cycle has been passed, and Rover's profits are now finally starting to flow.
BAe may still offer better opportunities than the Rolls-Royce bolt hole into
which some shareholders are diving.

FT  19 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: BTR
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Winter must be fading fast if BTR's sudden spurt of spring cleaning is any
guide. The company's declared strategy is to concentrate on industrial
manufacturing businesses where it has a strongly focused presence. Owning a
majority stake in a lucky dip of Canadian manufacturing operations
presumably does not fit that bill. Grahams Builders Merchants is equally
surplus to requirements and, by the same logic, BTR's other distribution
businesses must be edging towards the door.
The disposals also conserve cash, as did the enhanced scrip dividend, though
since gearing is expected to fall to 40 per cent this year, that seems
unlikely to be the prime motivation. Still, even after tidying up, a large
cash bid looks some way off, as does a paper deal given BTR's de-rating
relative to the market over the past year.
The purchase of Rexnord shows that smaller acquisitions are still possible.
Since the group is apparently not yet quite as Mr Alan Jackson, the chief
executive, would like it, such smaller scale shuffling may well continue.
That seems reasonable. But BTR has made much of its strength in buying and
managing businesses. Shareholders made nervous by change may not like to see
the company develop too much of a taste for jobbing assets.

FT  19 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Elf Aquitaine
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
While yesterday's large fall in full-year profits at Elf Aquitaine is a
gloomy preamble to privatisation, the stock market was primed to expect the
worst. The combination of a weak oil price and European recession was always
going to be painful. The asset writedowns which cloud the figures look like
a classic case of deck-clearing before new shareholders are invited aboard.
With large exploration and production interests - and production rising
through the middle of the decade - Elf should be well placed to benefit from
any upturn in the oil price.
Other parts of the empire are more difficult to judge. Overcapacity in
petrochemicals is likely to hold back Elf's plastics interests, even as
economic recovery takes hold. Petrol retailing in France faces intense
competition as hypermarkets muscle in. That points to more restructuring if
Mr Philippe Jaffre, who took over as chairman in August, is prepared to use
the freedom of privatisation. With gearing approaching 50 per cent, he might
also question the logic of maintaining Elf Aquitaine's portfolio of
shareholdings. Yesterday's writedown of financial assets may not be the
last.
Measured against cash flow, Elf Aquitaine looks cheap compared with other
big oil companies. But that has been true for some years without prompting a
re-rating of the shares. A yield over 4.5 per cent amounts to a more
persuasive argument for taking the plunge. Since the company accounts for
around 8 per cent of the CAC-40 share index, international investors with a
hunger for French equities may be unable to resist.

FT  19 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: MAI covers the Angles
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MAI's agreed bid for Anglia further stirs the pot about the value of media
assets, given the full price being paid. The minimum offer price of 637p is
32 per cent higher than Anglia's previous close and more than three times
its 1992 low. It represents an exit multiple of about 37 times Anglia's
forecast 1993 earnings.
Even so, MAI does not expect the deal to dilute earnings in its first full
year. From the outside, it is difficult to judge whether that is realistic.
Anglia does have cash on its balance sheet and has valuable investments in
radio, BSB loan stock and the Village Roadshow. Once those are excluded, the
earnings multiple drops to a plain expensive 27 times. MAI can achieve
unspecified cost savings by part-merging Anglia with its majority-owned
Meridian franchise. The two stations can wave at each other across the
Thames estuary, which should yield savings in regional programming and
transmission. But those potential savings may prove less than the margin for
error in forecast revenues. The rhetoric used to justify the price sounds
worryingly reminiscent of that used in the 1980s to explain the value of
advertising agencies.
Still, Lord Hollick has a well-deserved reputation for corporate miserliness
and has had a chance to scour Anglia's books. Part funding the deal with
convertible preference shares also lends greater financial flexibility. The
bid must reflect on Granada's tussle with LWT. It strengthens Granada's
arguments about industry consolidation. But it also raises expectations that
it will have to pay a touch more.

FT  19 JAN 94 / Upbeat sounds in Motown: The Big Three US carmakers are
enjoying a renaissance in their expanding home market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The outside temperatures are sub-zero, and ice floes are drifting down the
Detroit River, but inside the US motor industry the heat is on.
By implementing 'massive structural changes', US automakers have turned the
tables on their foreign rivals and brought about 'nothing less than the
renaissance of the American automobile industry', says Mr Helmut Werner,
chief executive of Mercedes-Benz.
While sales continue to plunge in west Europe and Japan, demand for new
vehicles is rising in North America, where the domestic US producers are
making the biggest gains, in particular in light trucks, traditionally their
strongest market. The previously all-conquering Japanese carmakers have lost
market share in the US for the past two years in succession.
Japanese and European vehicle producers are also losing money as the big
three US carmakers - General Motors, Ford and Chrysler - are back in the
black, to an enthusiastic reception on Wall Street.
The share prices of the Big Three began to climb back from the depths in
early 1992, but the pace became hectic last year. In recent days prices have
again reached new peaks, as financial analysts returned to New York from
last week's Detroit motor show convinced that the best of the recovery is
still to come.
The surge has been led by Chrysler, the smallest of the US carmakers, which
was virtually written off as a serious competitor in the world industry at
the start of the 1990s. The Chrysler share price has risen sixfold in the
past three years, jumping from a low of Dollars 9.38 at the end of 1990 to
close at Dollars 62 1/2 on Tuesday.
Yesterday the company announced a record pre-tax profit of Dollars 3.8bn for
1993, four times the Dollars 934m earned in 1992. As recently as 1991 it
suffered a pre-tax loss of Dollars 910m.
The company has been rejuvenated since the end of the 1980s by a drastic
restructuring and a series of successful product launches. 'Right now we are
having a lot of fun,' says Mr Robert Eaton, Chrysler chairman and chief
executive. 'We were the first automaker to recognise that basic changes were
taking place in our industry, and we were the first to prepare for them.
'We began by cutting costs and eliminating waste while preserving future
product spending. We sold non-automotive assets. And we began to get lean.
But as we trimmed our workforce, we also reorganised into (chassis) platform
teams that design cars faster and more efficiently.'
Chrysler increased its US car and light truck sales by 19.9 per cent last
year to 2.047m in a market that rose by 8 per cent. It raised its market
share to 14.7 per cent, the highest level for 23 years, and its latest
products such as the Dodge Stratus/Chrysler Cirrus large family car range,
unveiled at the Detroit show, are yet to reach the market.
While Chrysler's rise from the ashes has been the most striking aspect of
the recovery of confidence in Motown, Ford, the second-largest US player,
has also made impressive progress in its home market. It boosted its share
of the US light vehicle market - cars and light trucks - to 25.6 per cent
last year, its highest level since 1978, and accounted for five of the 10
best-selling vehicles in the US last year.
'The recession is behind us,' says Mr Alex Trotman, Ford chairman and chief
executive. 'There has been steady economic growth for several quarters and
there will be more growth in 1994 with low interest rates and low
inflation.'
The US new vehicle market rose by 8 per cent last year to 14.2m, the highest
level since 1989, and US industry leaders are forecasting further gains this
year to 15m-15.2m.
At General Motors, the leading US vehicle maker, it is still too early for
celebration, but the stumbling giant of the world auto industry appears to
be seeing some light at the end of the tunnel for its North American
automotive operations.
GM remains the high-cost US producer and its balance sheet is still weak,
but the group's new management team, installed following a boardroom coup in
1992, has at least stopped the bleeding in North America. Mr Jack Smith, GM
chief executive, insists that the strategies are now in place that will
allow GM 'ultimately' to reassert its leadership of the world industry.
GM at least achieved an operating break-even on its North American
automotive operations in 1993 before interest, tax and special items, which
represented a turnround of more than Dollars 10bn from the horrendous losses
of the previous two years. The new target is to achieve at least a
break-even at the net level in 1994.
'GM's unrivalled size and success made it easy for us to ignore the
significance of change and the signs of potential future problems,' admits
Mr Smith. 'The lesson we have learnt is that for unrivalled leaders, success
itself breeds the roots of complacency, myopia, and ultimately, decline.'
GM's biggest cost reductions in the short term - Dollars 4bn between the end
of 1990 and the end of 1993 - have been achieved by consolidating 27 North
American purchasing units into one.
The shock waves of GM's drastic moves to cut purchasing costs - led
initially by the now notorious Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, who moved
last year to Volkswagen - are still reverberating through the US components
industry, however. 'The scar tissue does not heal very fast. Trust must
still be rebuilt,' says the chief executive of one leading US automotive
supplier.
The drive to cut purchasing costs was GM's short-term panic response to its
financial crisis. More significant for the long term, it is seeking
radically to restructure and rationalise its product development and
engineering operations in North America to reduce costs and lead times and
to introduce more common processes, systems and parts.
The target is to reduce the total number of its passenger car chassis
platforms in North America (excluding its Saturn small car) from 12 in 1991
to only five by the end of the decade.
'We know we won't get there overnight,' admits Mr Smith. It is taking time
to turn round the cumbersome GM bureaucracy, but belatedly the company is
trying to acquire the agility that has been discovered by Chrysler.
GM is already benefiting, however, from one aspect of the current recovery
in the North American market, namely the surge in demand for light trucks -
the pick-ups, four-wheel-drive sports/utilities and minivans or
multi-purpose vehicles (MPVs) - that US consumers are increasingly buying in
preference to traditional passenger cars. GM has had to move to three-shift,
round-the-clock assembly at some truck plants to meet demand.
Light trucks now account for 40 per cent of US passenger vehicle demand, and
it is a sector still dominated by the Big Three. While new car sales rose by
4 per cent to 8.5m last year - still way below the peak of 11.46m in 1986 -
light truck sales jumped 16 per cent to a record 5.7m.
Americans' love affair with trucks dates from the 1970s and early 1980s,
when successive oil crises forced US vehicle makers to start building
smaller, less powerful cars. Mr Roy Roberts, general manager of General
Motors' GMC Truck, says that trucks continued to offer 'the performance and
power that customers wanted', but he admits that US producers have
underestimated the strength of demand.
'The sheer size of this infatuation with trucks has caught us somewhat
off-guard. The industry has struggled to find the capacity to meet the
demand. Right now we have excess capacity for cars and not enough for
trucks.'
The dominance of the US industry in this sector is greatly helped by a 25
per cent tariff on several categories of light trucks imports, which has
helped to keep its Japanese rivals at bay.
Japanese vehicle makers, which had carved out a share of 25.7 per cent of
the US light vehicle market by 1991, are now under pressure on many fronts
in the US. Most important, they have been forced to increase prices much
faster than their US rivals to compensate for the appreciation in the value
of the yen. Their market share fell last year to 23.1 per cent.
The resurgence in the US auto industry's fortunes has not been achieved
easily, however, and Mr Trotman warns that the world's vehicle makers still
face 'a severe dogfight. Some producers are not going to survive.'
The US industry, so recently itself on the critical list, must now fight to
hold its edge. 'We aren't smiling about the problems they are having in
Japan,' says Mr Eaton. 'They'll be back . . . If we let ourselves get caught
up in the euphoria of the moment we'll never get where we want to go. And we
have a long way to go.'

FT  19 JAN 94 / Leading Article: BES, EIS and other carrots
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Part of the received wisdom about the British financial system since the
1930s is that small and medium-sized companies are starved of funds. A
recurring feature of British budgets over the same period has been the
unveiling of new fiscal and financial incentives for investment in the small
business sector. Mr Kenneth Clarke's November budget was no exception. The
question is whether the successor to the Business Expansion Scheme (BES),
the Enterprise Investment Scheme, along with the forthcoming introduction of
Venture Capital Trusts, will make any more difference than previous
initiatives; and, indeed, whether the whole approach is not fundamentally
misconceived.
It is easy enough to make the case that the fiscal and financial systems
contain a bias against the small end of the corporate spectrum. For much of
the time since it was introduced in 1965, capital gains tax has been a
powerful disincentive to potential owner-managers and investors. Its present
40 per cent level is one of the highest in the developed world. In practice
it can be higher still, since losses cannot be carried back or offset
against other taxes. Because the tax is charged on realisation, it has a
locking-in effect that distorts investment decisions.
Capital gains tax has thus reinforced the existing fiscal bias to
institutional investment, whereby a majority of company securities are owned
by insurance companies and pension funds. For them, the effort of managing
unquoted investments is disproportionate to the reward; all the more so with
difficult types of venture capital such as start-ups. Moreover, insurance
company solvency regulations tend to penalise unquoted investments. So, too,
does the maturity of occupational pension schemes. With cash flow only
marginally covering pension payments, fund managers have to pay greater
attention to the liquidity of their investments.
Problem area
The banks, meanwhile, find the bottom end of the corporate spectrum a
problem area - witness their huge recent provisions against small business
lending. Specialist institutions such as 3I have done their bit. Yet the
debate about a financing gap continues.
The BES undoubtedly removed much of the fiscal disincentive to invest in
unquoted companies. Relief was available both on the investment made, and on
income and capital gains. The same will be true, with variations, in the
Enterprise Investment Scheme, but with no relief available for investment in
rented housing and a new opportunity for investors to become paid directors,
or 'business angels'. The charge to capital gains on other investments will
be deferred if the proceeds are invested in qualifying companies. When the
consultative document on Venture Capital Trusts appears shortly there will
no doubt be reliefs of comparable attraction.
Below average
Yet the striking thing about the BES is how little investors prospered from
the relief. On some estimates only 20 per cent of the 1,300 publicly funded
companies set up under the scheme returned any cash to their investors. That
suggests that, if the tax relief really did encourage additional investment
in unquoted companies, it was chiefly in projects with below average
prospects of showing economic returns. Meanwhile, private individuals have
been encouraged to shun quoted shares in favour of unquoted ones.
This is symptomatic of a more fundamental problem about the taxation of
savings that successive chancellors have ducked. Income, which is the
central element of the present tax base, is hard to define. When the rates
of tax on income and capital gains are substantially aligned, as they have
been since the 1988 budget, investment decisions may be less distorted. But
the accretion of new reliefs and restrictions immediately makes a nonsense
of the genuflection to fiscal neutrality.
The best answer would be to move to an expenditure tax, since this
eliminates, inter alia, the need to make the difficult distinction between
capital and revenue. That, in effect, is how pension funds are now taxed.
Extending the principle to the whole tax base would provide a more coherent
set of incentives for savings, investment and enterprise. It is overdue for
a more sympathetic hearing from the Treasury.

FT  19 JAN 94 / Leading Article: Job-search in Germany
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Slow off the mark they may have been, but it is hard to fault the efforts of
chancellor Helmut Kohl and his Christian Democrat colleagues in their search
for solutions to Germany's growing economic crisis. There is nothing like an
election year to focus the minds of incumbent politicians. Yesterday the
governing coalition agreed to another batch of public spending cuts and an
'Action Programme' to speed job creation. This 30-point plan, which includes
a dose of privatisation and deregulation, looks like being the main element
in the coalition's election platform.
Ideally, the coalition would have gone to the polls with a recovery well
under way. The best it can probably hope for, after the largest annual fall
in output since the second world war, is that the economy will not continue
to deteriorate in 1994. But unemployment in western Germany is now 2.5m -
8.1 per cent of the working population and still rising. Millions more east
Germans are in either official or disguised unemployment. The risk of
electoral disaster for the government and success for parties of the far
right is real.
Macroeconomic policy remains far from growth-inducing. The Bundesbank shows
little sign of accelerating the snail-like pace of interest rate cuts,
despite overwhelming evidence that monetary policy is too tight and that
fiscal policy is also contractionary. The recent data suggest that economics
minister Gunter Rexrodt's official forecast of 1 to 1.5 per cent growth this
year is wishful thinking. The zero growth prediction of the government's
independent economic advisers looks much nearer the mark.
What the coalition can do is appear to be trying to affect the
employment-intensity of growth. Hence the package of deregulatory measures
designed to make it easier to hire part-time workers, to enable companies to
hire the long-term unemployed by undercuting minimum wages, to legalise
private employment agencies and to clamp down on companies which employ
illegal immigrants.
Modest dose
In short, the German government has proposed a modest dose of
Anglo-American-style 'flexibility'. The proposals, following the European
Commission's recent employment white paper, have a decidedly Delorsian tinge
which should make it harder for the Social Democratic Party to oppose them
outright. Moreover, the mood of the German unions is also shifting. The
recent wage deal in the chemicals industry involves a modest 2 per cent wage
rise and accepted plant-level bargaining over the working week within a 35
to 40 hour range.
Low wages
The structure of Germany's labour market also suggests that the potential
for more rapid job creation exists. The Anglo-American experience in the
1980s suggests that liberalising employment regulations encourages companies
to hire more women, young people and immigrants to work part-time for
relatively low wages in the service sector. Germany has fewer women in work
than either the US or UK, a lower proportion of part-time jobs, a smaller
service sector and a more compressed wage distribution.
Yet US and British experience shows that relatively rapid growth of service
sector employment can co-exist with stubborn male unemployment. While women
are going out to work, relatively unskilled men are left waiting hopelessly
for the return of their old industrial jobs. Germany avoided large-scale
job-shedding in the 1980s, but industry is now reducing employment at a
rapid rate.
Since German manufacturing starts with a much higher share of total
employment than other developed countries, male employment has
correspondingly further to fall.
How far depends, in part, on the stance of macroeconomic policy. The longer
the Bundesbank uses a high exchange rate to bear down indirectly on service
sector inflation, the greater the damage to industry. That service sector
inflation has fallen by over 2 percentage points since the summer suggests a
cut in short-term rates is now overdue.
Even so, Germany will emerge from this recession with a much large number of
long-term unemployed males, especially in the east. This year's election may
be too soon for the far right to exploit their unease. But the threat will
remain.

William Waldegrave, the British cabinet minister charged with clearing away
the cobwebs of secrecy in Whitehall, has a problem. His elegant room in the
Cabinet Office contains a large, impregnable steel safe. Does it contain
some of Whitehall's darkest secrets? He has no idea; he can't open it
because the key has mysteriously disappeared.
The Cabinet Office could take a leaf out of the Treasury's book. The
instructions for changing the combinations on the locks to that ministry's
safes are so complicated that hardly anybody bothers. Most prefer to retain
the safes' original, identical numbers.
No wonder the Treasury gave up budget purdah.

What would Hong Kong be without ostentatious displays of wealth and
connections? C K Ma, chairman of the Oriental Press Group, plumbed new
depths last night in his launch party for the Eastern Express, an English
language daily.
Ma, 37, enticed a few hundred guests to come along and watch video messages
from Ronald Reagan and George Bush. More predictably governor Chris Patten
put in a personal appearance. Paul Keating, prime minister of Australia,
Ma's adopted country, sent a note.
Champagne, Iranian caviar, and lobster were topped off by guests receiving
gift packs - including a copy of the new newspaper and a titanium and gold
Tiffany's propelling ball-point pen - from an immaculately turned out army
of young women.
Like the heirs of Jardine and Matheson, Ma has gone far to live down his
family's past association with drug trafficking. His uncle Sik-yu was known
as 'White Powder Ma'; his father Ma Sik-chun dominated the heroin trade in
the 1960s and beyond. Both fled to Taiwan in 1974, where White Powder Ma
died in 1992.

The decision to privatise Pro Ned, which specialises in finding
non-executive directors, is rather sad. It may be a rather sleepy
organisation but it did provide a sizeable reservoir of non-executive
directors where small companies could fish without being charged exorbitant
fees by the big headhunters.
Sir Adrian Cadbury, who chaired the committee on corporate governance, will
continue as chairman of the new venture, a partnership with Egon Zehnder
International. But he is only going to stay for a year or so and after that
he says he is severing his ties with the City. His term as a director of the
Bank of England, where he has been since 1970, expires at the end of next
month.
Sir Adrian's impending departure from City life perhaps explains the timing
of Pro Ned's latest move.

FT  19 JAN 94 / Observer: The Rovelli revels
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Even in today's Italy, where recession and corruption scandals have caused
many family fortunes to shrink, some have managed to survive. The Rovelli
clan is one such. Nino Rovelli, it may be recalled, was the aggressive
tycoon whose petrochemicals empire collapsed in 1979. But this week his five
direct heirs have received a handsome cheque for L678bn.
The cheque represents the final settlement of a 15-year legal battle
involving 12 separate hearings waged by the Rovellis against financial
institutions. They were accused of failing to take proper account of the
Rovellis' petrochemicals flagship, Sir, when some L4,000bn of debt was
called in. The battle with IMI, the treasury-controlled financial services
group now about to be privatised, was particularly bitter. Just before Nino
Rovelli died two years ago he was reportedly willing to settle for L250bn;
IMI then thought it might get better terms.
The settlement now agreed is the largest ever such pay-out - even more so
once a L330bn tax deduction is added on. IMI has long set aside covering
funds; nevertheless, the Rovelli cheque looks pretty large beside the
L2,200bn shortly to be raised from offering 30 per cent of its stock.
The cheque goes to Rovelli's widow, Primarosa, and their four children. Now
based in Switzerland, the family has yet to say how it will spend the lucre.

FT  19 JAN 94 / Personal View: If I were a government minister . . .
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BONFIELD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I was recently discussing the state of the information technology industry
in the UK with a trade and industry minister. I had already said that I had
not come to seek money - this puts ministers at their ease - but that I
thought it was time the DTI, indeed the government, showed leadership with
regard to some of the major issues facing industry.
These discussions often cause me to consider what I would do if I were in
the other person's shoes. How would I behave if I were a DTI minister?
Clearly, I would need to make some broad assumptions: I would be in a
government promoting healthy markets, rather than 'picking winners'; the
government would remain committed to sound money, low inflation and low
interest rates; and it would be playing a positive role in Europe.
The principal areas of consideration are:
Competition: First and foremost, the government's role is to ensure that
there are a few, simple, transparent and consistent rules designed to
promote a competitive business environment.
These should be applied lightly but unfailingly. Since competition has to be
seen in a European Union context, the government must vigorously advocate
similar rules in those areas where it is appropriate to have an EU-wide
policy - for example, state aid.
Trade policy: The UK is still a leading trading nation. It needs open
markets for its goods, services and capital investment. Conversely, the UK's
market must be fully open too. We must continue to promote open markets in
the EU and in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
But we have a particular responsibility towards our neighbours in central
and eastern Europe. It seems bizarre that we maintain aid programmes - such
as the UK Know How Fund and the EU's Phare programme  - designed to improve
their industries, while at the same time denying them full access to our
markets.
Technological Base: To be competitive, Britain needs to invest continually
in its technological base. This means that the DTI and Office of Science and
Technology must share a single, clear vision for the UK as a technology
provider and innovator.
The government should mobilise all the considerable science and technology
talent in this country behind improving the competitiveness of UK industry.
Programmes to encourage innovation and engineering excellence will provide
measurable benefits for industry, higher education and society as a whole.
The process of nurturing engineering and science talent must start in the
schools. The aim would be to develop fine, well-rounded individuals who
would strive to be winners.
Best practice: Globalisation of markets continues apace. To ensure the UK
stays genuinely competitive, its companies need to benchmark themselves
against the strongest competitors.
As a minister I would do everything possible to promote benchmarking: for
example, using mechanisms such as the DTI innovation unit. I would work with
the Training and Enterprise Councils to find better ways of transferring
technological innovation and best practice throughout the business
community, linking up with the DTI one-stop shop concept.
People: None of the above will happen unless we have highly skilled,
motivated people. Britain needs to put more power behind the Investors in
People programme.
By insisting that large companies should be accredited as Investors in
People before they can bid for government business, overnight a large
percentage of UK-based companies could be motivated to stop pussy-footing
over training. After all, the UK's lack of skilled labour and its effect on
its national competitiveness are not new phenomena - royal commissions have
identified it as a big issue as far back as 1884.
Finally, on the basis that the government should also take the medicine it
so freely dispenses to industry, I would implement Investors in People
policies throughout government service and back them up with
performance-related pay schemes. To eliminate unnecessary red tape,
'bureaucracy reduction' would be one of the performance measures and, of
course, government would be run as a total quality management operation.
This approach would enable the DTI and industry - 'our customers' - to speak
the same language. Customer satisfaction could be measured by, perhaps,
looking at export performance and job creation figures; or perhaps it should
be assumed that the general election is the ultimate expression of 'customer
satisfaction'?

FT  19 JAN 94 / The FT Interview: Self-reliant streak to jack of all trades
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Mr John Jackson was a schoolboy, one of his teachers said to him:
'Jackson, if you're not careful, you'll become an absolutely useless
dilettante.'
Mr Jackson, 64, who became chairman of Ladbroke at the beginning of this
year, sternly denies any charges of dilettantism. Whether studying plants,
butterflies, walking in the Himalayas or running companies, he insists that
each task gets his full attention.
Nevertheless, as the chairman of seven quoted groups and London solicitors
Mishcon de Reya, the director of several other companies, and part owner of
the magazine History Today, he is open to the charge that he cannot possibly
master them all.
Mr Jackson is part of a small group of UK businessmen who have become
professional chairmen and non-executive directors. After 28 years with the
British subsidiary of Philips, the Dutch electronics group, he realised he
would rise no higher than the UK board and decided to look for non-executive
appointments. Philips gave him an office, a secretary and a parking space.
His current chairmanships include: Graseby, the electronics group; Celltech,
the biotechnology company; Howden, the engineering group; Brown &amp; Jackson,
owner of the Poundstretcher discount retail chain; Wyndeham Press, a
printing and packaging company; and the computer services concern,
SD-Scicon. He is also a director of marketing services group WPP, among
others.
By his own admission, chairing a company is a full-time job. He says: 'A
chairman is neither executive or non-executive. He's a chairman 24 hours a
day.'
How can all his companies get 24 hours a day? By managing his time
rigorously, he can ensure that each company gets sufficient attention, he
insists. Mr Philip Swinstead, founder of SD-Scicon, says: 'He has this
fantastic ability to compartmentalise his mind and switch with each
telephone call to another compartment.'
As to Mr Jackson being useless, shareholders in Ladbroke - whose interests
include betting shops, Hilton International hotels and the Texas Homecare
do-it-yourself chain - currently think otherwise.
Mr Jackson earlier this month achieved what many despairing Ladbroke
observers had considered impossible: he persuaded Mr Cyril Stein, head of
the company for nearly four decades, to step down from the board.
While few dispute Mr Stein's role in building up Ladbroke from a small
high-society betting agent to its current status as an employer of 53,000
people, many had tired of the group's secretiveness. One analyst recalls a
results presentation when Mr Stein accepted three questions and then led the
board out of the room.
Last September, Ladbroke said Mr Stein would step down as chairman at the
end of 1993 but would remain a non-executive director for three years. Mr
Jackson, then vice-chairman, would become chairman.
Almost immediately, it became clear the arrangement would not work. Mr
Stein, who was ill when Mr Jackson announced the change, telephoned the FT
from his sick bed to say he would still play a leading role in the group's
decision-making.
There was similar confusion over who was in charge late last year when
Ladbroke made contradictory announcements about whether it would take
advantage of the new foreign income dividend scheme. Unlike conventional
dividends, foreign income dividends do not carry a tax credit which pension
fund investors can claim. Pension fund shareholders' annoyance caused the
share price to fall.
Mr Jackson does not regret the original plan for Mr Stein to remain on the
board. He says: 'I thought it could work. I knew Cyril as being a man of
very strong character who was capable of disciplining himself. What I didn't
know was whether he would or whether the outside world would give him a
chance to.
'The outside world can make life difficult for someone trying to cope with a
situation of this kind. It's not malice or wickedness. I think well-meaning
people said things to Cyril that made life difficult for him. There were
people who made remarks like: 'What are you going to do now, Cyril?' '
How did Mr Jackson persuade Mr Stein to give up his non-executive post on
the board as well as the chairmanship? Mr Swinstead says he can guess how Mr
Jackson persuaded Mr Stein to go: 'I've seen him take tough decisions. I've
seen him turn around to someone and say: 'This isn't working. I'm upset,
you're upset.' With a smile on his face.' In dealing with Mr Stein, Mr
Swinstead thinks, 'John will have worked away, he will have gone on and on
until eventually the unassailable logic of the situation will have got
through'.
Is that how it happened? Mr Jackson says it became clear in the last months
of 1993 that Mr Stein was going to find it painful not to have the last
word. 'A great deal of harm might have been done to the company and to him.
It wasn't difficult to come to the conclusion that there should be a clean
break.'
He adds: 'Many people who have created great companies find it difficult to
distinguish between themselves and the company.'
Mr Jackson could not be more different. A constant theme of his conversation
is an obsession with self-sufficiency, with not being indissolubly linked
with a particular company. For example, at Mishcon de Reya, where he has his
office, he insists on paying rent.
He traces his interest in self-reliance back to his father's unemployment.
Before Mr Jackson was born, his father had worked in Mozambique on a
cotton-planting scheme and had come down with blackwater fever.
'He and my mother and my brother and I lived in the (English) West Country
in a fisherman's house. We survived by taking in lodgers and living off the
sea and allotments. It taught me a hell of a lot about looking after
myself,' he says.
'That view of life was reinforced during the second world war. It showed me
how you could be self-reliant and live with other people in a community. One
of the great effects of the war was that it brought people together.'
In the 1970s, he devised an exercise in self-sufficiency for his own family:
for six years, on borrowed land in Kent, the Jacksons produced their own
meat, milk, eggs, vegetables and some fruit. They produced a surplus, which
they sold to old age pensioners at reduced prices.
Self-sufficiency cuts both ways. He believes companies need to know when to
tell the chairman to go. 'The chairman must be the one member of the board
sackable at one second's notice. If he's not doing his job properly, his
colleagues should get rid of him.'
So far, Mr Jackson has been given credit for making Ladbroke more
approachable. When, with Mr Stein ill in bed, Mr Jackson announced the
group's half-year results last September, analysts recall that he asked one
of them whether he was happy with an answer a director had given him. The
analyst said he wasn't. Mr Jackson asked the director for more details. It
is a sign of the suspicion in which Ladbroke had been held that this was
seen as the beginning of a new dawn.
Mr Jackson says the group intends to dispose of its substantial property
portfolio, a particular interest of Mr Stein. The group is also considering
changing its name. When the Texas chain is more profitable, the group will
decide whether it should be retained or sold. Ladbroke's board will have to
decide whether to cut its dividend, a move resisted by Mr Stein but regarded
by the City as an essential token of the group's prudence and realism.
The City has long feared that Ladbroke's reticence concealed a dark
accounting secret. That suspicion is starting to fade. Mr Jackson now needs
to dispel it entirely.

FT  19 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Nigerian government has not abandoned
economic reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Prof JIDE OSUNTOKUN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Permit me to comment on your article 'Nigeria turns away from market
economy' (January 12). It is not true that Nigeria has abandoned economic
reforms. Neither can this present government be accused of abandoning the
policy of transparency and financial accountability. The present government
headed by General Abacha is in fact conducting in-house probes of key
ministries whose functions impact on the economy of Nigeria and is thereby
setting the standards of probity and accountability by which this government
will be judged by its successor.
The present policy of fixing the rate of the Naira is needed to ensure the
financial stability necessary for economic development. Our government's
decision to reduce interest rates from the prevailing 45 per cent to between
12 to 15 per cent, coupled with controlled and judicious use of foreign
exchange, would lead to an increase in capacity utilisation in our
industrial sector from the present level of 35 per cent.
We witnessed in the recent past uncontrolled capital flight as a result of
wholesale liberalisation of the banking sector. All the so-called merchant
banks were nothing other than foreign exchange traders with little or no
interest in production. You will agree the interest rate regime is not the
only element of a policy of structural adjustment.
It is true that producer prices of various export commodities may fall
because of our decision to fix the Naira rate. However, the anticipated
decline in the inflation rate would obviate the effect of this fall. It is
certainly better to bring down inflation through increased production in all
sectors of the economy rather than encourage trading in paper money which
the interest rate hitherto prevailing encouraged.
As for the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, we have done
virtually everything they wanted us to do in the last 10 years without the
promised financial assistance. We have put in place a solid policy including
cutting bureaucracy, privatisation, abolition of Commodity Boards,
increasing the cost of energy by 500 per cent and reducing all social
welfare costs. Also, we are presently embarking on measures to ensure
transparency and accountability in government. The IMF and the World Bank
must accept that a doctrinaire approach to economic development has never
worked anywhere, as can be seen in the collapse of the economies in Russia
and eastern Europe and those of most countries in Africa, with attendant
social cost and political instability. Nigeria hopes the international
community will assist in making us a good partner of our trading partners.

FT  19 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Dangers posed by a larger rouble zone
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Prof STEVE H HANKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your editorial, 'Gaidar departs' (January 17), reports that one reason
for Mr Yegor Gaidar's unexpected departure from the Yeltsin camp was his
objection to the Russian-Belarus economic merger. You correctly conclude
that the resulting monetary union poses a serious problem for Russia because
the control of rouble credits will be more difficult.
Your exclusive concern with the well-being of Russia and its reformers fails
to show the real dangers posed by an enlargement of the rouble zone,
however. Since last March, when officials of the Yeltsin government told
leaders in eastern Europe not to bother building large embassies in Kiev,
Ukraine, because they would be downgraded to consular sections within 16
months, the Yeltsin government's objective of reconstituting the former
Soviet Union has been transparent. On January 7, when you reported that
Belarus and Tajikistan had been reincorporated into the rouble zone, it
became clear the zone would provide Russia with the instrument to put the
Soviet Union back together again.
With the exception of Estonia, which followed our advice (see: Rahareform
Vabale Eestile: Valautafondi Lahendus, Tartu, Estonia: Tartu Ulikool, 1992)
and adopted a currency board-like system in June 1992, the independence of
the republics of the former Soviet Union is threatened. They are vulnerable
to Russian rouble-zone meddling. This is because western institutions and
advisers have blindly counselled republics that central banks were the only
institutions suited to solving the republics' currency problems. As you
reported on January 7 ('Tajikistan swaps Soviet roubles for Russian ones'),
this western strategy has been a disaster. Indeed, the failure of central
banking in the republics has provided the ever-opportunistic Russian
government with the opening it needs to swallow up the republics without
firing a shot.
The currency board system is the only way republics of the former Soviet
Union can ensure stable currencies and their sovereignty. Lithuania, like
Estonia, has realised this. Its government passed a draft law on Credibility
of the Litas on December 15 1993. If approved by the parliament, Lithuania
will have a currency board which will insulate it from predatory tactics.

FT  19 JAN 94 / Blocs on the horizon: The notion of an 'east Asian economic
caucus' is gaining ground
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In Nineteen Eighty-four George Orwell imagined the world of the late-20th
century divided into three blocs: Oceania, Eurasia and Eastasia. Basically
similar in their domestic totalitarian systems, they nonetheless flourished
by depicting each other as deeply alien, hostile and threatening. At any
given moment two of the blocs would be allied against the third, but every
now and then the alliances would suddenly be reversed, preserving a rough
but unstable balance.
The actual late-20th century, whatever its other faults, has so far been
mercifully unlike Orwell's vision. Yet the spectre of 'blocism' continues to
haunt us. Time and again we are warned of the danger that, having disposed
of the cold war, the industrialised world will now arrange itself into three
great regional trading blocs, dominated by Japan, the European Union and the
US; and that all other countries will have to attach themselves to one or
other of these blocs if they are to survive econom-ically.
The EU raised this spectre first. Its common external tariff, and its
delegation of negotiating power in trade matters to a single, supranational
authority, made it look a bit like a bloc. Plans for the single market, when
first announced in the mid-1980s, prompted much talk of 'fortress Europe' in
other parts of the world, even though what was involved was the removal of
internal non-tariff barriers and few if any new barriers to external trade
were erected.
Now the North American Free Trade Agreement, even though it stops far short
of a common market, let alone a political union, has aroused similar fears
and suspicions in Asia. And of course the rest of us, well aware that east
Asia is much the fastest expanding market in the world today, are anxiously
on the look-out for signs that east Asia might be closed to us, with Japan
seeking once again to turn it into a private hunting ground.
The spectre loomed extra large in the closing stages of the Uruguay Round of
the Gatt trade liberalisation talks, when mothers took to scaring their
children with warnings that unless they took their free-trade medicine at
bed-time they would wake up in a cold, unfriendly three-bloc world.
Specially recalcitrant children had to be scared with creepy variations in
the plot.
Last November, for instance, C. Fred Bergsten, a leading US economist, told
a European audience that they should realise the alternative to success in
the Gatt talks was not a three- but a two-bloc world, with the US and Asia
ganging up against the Europeans.
Shortly before Mr Bergsten's warning, Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of
state, had delivered a similar message, reminding western Europe that it was
'no longer the dominant area of the world'. The main evidence for this
proposition seemed to be that 'there is a lot of criticism coming from
western Europe, but I don't see or hear it coming from Asia'.
Mr Christopher should listen more carefully. There is a rising tide of
criticism from Asia, not perhaps of his personal performance, but of the US
and indeed of 'the west'. Malaysian prime minister Mahathir Mohamad is the
best-known critic, but Mr Lee Kuan Yew, former prime minister of Singapore,
is not far behind. Such leaders think that Asia now has more to teach the
west, about virtues such as 'discipline, loyalty and diligence', than to
learn from it about democracy or human rights.
Mr Mahathir has for years been campaigning for an 'east Asian economic
caucus', so far without much success: he was alone in his boycott of the
recent Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation summit in Seattle. Japan has
firmly refused Mr Mahathir's invitations to take the lead in any kind of
economic bloc. It is all the more interesting, therefore, to find that Mr
Mahathir's ideas are taken seriously by Mr Ogura Kazuo, head of the economic
affairs bureau in the Japanese foreign ministry, who last July called for 'a
new concept of Asia', or 'Asian restoration'.
This emerging regional consciousness is underpinned by a strong sense of
economic achievement, and also by rapidly strengthening economic ties within
the region. In a paper prepared for last weekend's UK-Japan 2000 Group
conference, Mr Eiichi Matsumoto, a former vice-chairman of the Bank of
Tokyo, points out that 'Japan is increasingly replacing the US as an
absorber of Asian manufacturing products', while the fast-growing Asian
countries themselves 'now mutually absorb their manufacturing products in an
enhanced intra-regional trade'.
Yet 'Asia' as a region is even less clearly defined than 'Europe'. It
usually denotes the Pacific rim countries, inhabited by people with yellow
or brown skin and a Confucian or Buddhist cultural heritage, overlaid in
some cases with Christianity or Islam. South Korea, Japan, China,
Philippines, Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia are
clearly core members, but in some contexts India and/or Australia can also
be included.
The formation of these countries into any kind of bloc remains highly
implausible, and so long as they remain the world's most dynamic exporters
they can have little interest in such an arrangement. What does seem likely
is that Asians will be more prone to define themselves as such in political
and cultural terms. Like Europeans since the 1960s and for much the same
reason - a combination of economic success with an awkward feeling of
political inferiority and cultural insecurity - they will seek, in
schizophrenic fashion, both to 'stand up to' the US and to retain it as ally
and trading partner.

FT  19 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Incomprehensible and unfair tax
proposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN A NEWMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, More than 400 pages of tax legislation have just been published
affecting almost all businesses in the UK. While it would hypocritical of me
to complain about the necessity for most businesses to seek professional
guidance, I must point out that on any grounds the new tax law is
over-complex and even the professionals cannot understand it.
I can give two examples. The transitional proposals in Schedule 18 on the
new system of taxing more than 3m self-employed people are incomprehensible
and inexplicable. They are also glaringly unfair. Similarly, the treatment
of foreign exchange and other financial instruments, which affect a large
number of companies trading outside the UK, is very difficult to present
clearly to a businessman.
This is bad enough. But there were matters announced in the Budget that are
deregulatory. One was the firm commitment to relax audit requirements for
some limited companies. This repeal, which might decrease the workload, has
no draft legislation as yet. The Department of Trade and Industry advises
that a further consultative document will be issued shortly. Our clients are
unable to understand why their companies pay more taxes immediately but
cannot benefit from audit relaxation from December 31 1993. Another
regulatory matter was to move the National Insurance base into alignment
with the Pay-As-You-Earn tax base. This is being dealt with by further
consultation and legislation which, if anything, widens the divide with no
clear time stated.
Am only I disillusioned at how the government has ignored the need for fair
legislation, simply expressed?

FT  19 JAN 94 / Arts: Power shift becomes Oleanna - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A spectacular change of cast makes David Mamet's Oleanna look an even better
play than when it had its British premiere at the Royal Court last July.
There can be no higher praise than that.
The principal talent still lies in the writing. Nothing in Mamet's text is
redundant. The lines are short and frequently, but never pointlessly,
interrupted.
Here are two characters - a male professor and a not very bright female
student - failing to understand each other. With the new cast there is a
change in the balance of power.
There is an additional gain. The juxtaposition of the student's sense of
social inferiority and the professor's relative affluence, self-confidence
and security has become much clearer.
When I first saw Harold Pinter's production at the Court, I noted that it
was about much more than the current debate on political correctness. It was
about McCarthyism, liberalism and academic freedom over the ages.
I wrote, perhaps wrongly, that the gender clash was incidental to the theme:
the student might just as well have been male.
Now I am not so sure, for the great merit of Oleanna is that it can be
played in all sorts of ways.
Here the social side is much stronger. The student has worked hard to get to
college in the first place, and is probably the first member of her family
to have done so. She has read the professor's book in order to write her
essay. True, she doesn't understand it, but she expects to be taught and
given the rewards of a university education.
What she sees is a professor who seems at least as interested in buying a
new house and securing his tenure as teaching his subject. Moreover, he has
troubles with his wife and his telephone scarcely stops ringing.
It does so, almost fatally at the end of the first act when the student is
just beginning to become articulate.
By the start of act two, there has been a complete reversal of roles.
The girl has been to her campus committee and is pursuing a case against the
professor not only for sexual harassment, but also for relying on
unacceptable texts.
The student's perceptions are, of course, a travesty of the truth. The
professor is going out of his way to help her. Nevertheless, at her age and
with her background, it is the perceptions that count, and he does in a way
seem slightly smug and patronising.
None of that was so plain when the play first appeared. Not for the first
time I think that Pinter's direction has improved with repeated
performances.
The timing of the lines - and the interruptions - has become immaculate.
Just as important, the new cast is more fitted to the roles and thus allow
greater scope for ambiguity about who is more at fault.
In the original production David Suchet was a rather diffident professor who
would never hurt a fly except under extreme provocation. He tended to go
round apologising for himself. He has been succeeded by Denis Lawson. No-one
would use the word diffident about him. Lawson is tall, dark and handsome
with blow-dryed hair, oozes charm and knows it. All that makes the
perception of a sexual advance more plausible.
Again, in the original version the student as played by Lia Williams was a
mousy, reticent figure who seemed to have been put up to her complaints by
the campus committee.
Michelle Fairley is quite different. She seems to be acting in her own
right. Sometimes in the second act she seems frightening, not because she is
a timid girl who has been frightened into assertiveness, but because she is
genuinely frightening and believes what she is saying. Note the sting in the
way she seeks to turn the tables on the professor when making a (quite
false) distinction between allegations and facts.
None of that is to cast aspersions on the earlier performers. It is a
tribute to the play and the production. No doubt another team could play it
another way again, and one hopes that will happen. Here, in the gender war,
Lawson and Fairley come out on pretty well equal terms.
But that is only my impression. Oleanna is so good precisely because others
can reach different conclusions.

FT  19 JAN 94 / Arts: Roll fulfills early promise - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In 1963, at the tender age of 17, Michael Roll won the first Leeds piano
competition. After that his career developed erratically - there is a
revealing examination of this, and the progress of subsequent Leeds winners,
in Wendy Thompson's riveting 1990 history of the competition (published by
Faber) - and in recent years he seems to have cut a low profile on the
London musical scene.
The full house for Sunday's Queen Elizabeth Hall recital showed, however,
that Roll has not lost contact with the London piano-loving public. Not
having heard him play for some years, I must confess to being entirely
unprepared for the authority he demonstrated throughout the concert. Mea
culpa] In a programme of Classical masterworks - Beethoven's Op. 26 Sonata
and 'Eroica' Variations in the first half, the mighty Schubert B flat Sonata
in the second - Roll established from the first note his genuine,
concentrated and absolutely distinctive command of instrument and music.
This stamp of personal authority could be recognised in the sound-world the
pianist creates, with its crystalline pianissimos, forcefully delineated
attack leading to sharp-edged yet not brutal climaxes and incisive
articulation. Every note is scanned to justify its place in the larger
musical scheme, every figuration-pattern to provide more than mere textural
underlay.
In the variation-structures of both Beethoven works, this produced a sense
of unfolding adventure that carried with it an exhilaration, a feeling of
'going somewhere' by no means commonly achieved. Occasionally it also
resulted, I felt, in an over-insistent quality to Roll's phrase-shapes: the
middle episodes of the 'Eroica' Variations seemed too self-conscious in
their punctuation to disgorge the full measure of pawky good humour.
But this response should be understood as a matter of personal preference
rather than criticism; on its own terms the authority of Roll's Beethoven
brooks no argument. His Schubert likewise: the tremor of unease filtering
out from under the melodies was sustained and built upon in a manner that
allowed the last movement to attain its place as a genuine, and utterly
invigorating, completion to the whole edifice.
It was not a consoling Schubert reading. Questions were left
thought-provokingly open at the end. This alone provided an impressive token
of Mr Roll's mature mastery.

FT  19 JAN 94 / Arts: Brecht's fragmentary Fatzer - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fatzer, the hero of a play that Brecht neither published nor finished, is an
innocent non-conformist. Not that he is eccentric. Simply, he insists, 'I
can't go on doing what is fine for me and does harm to you'; and a choral
commentator remarks that he is not a 'mind-of-the-masses man.' Yes, an
archetypal Brecht hero; and his dissent links him to other such heroes of
German drama as Woyzeck. All around him you see society at its most brutish.
Evil flowers naturally; sex is an unfeeling and animal function; aggression
is everywhere.
After Brecht's death, the 'Fatzer' fragments were arranged into a montage by
the German playwright Heiner Muller, and now the Gate Theatre is presenting
them as translated and directed by Marc von Hemming. The main impression
this version leaves, however, is not of content but style.
The play has seven performers. At any time in the action, two or three of
them are standing at lecterns on the periphery of the stage. They don
spectacles, and at regular intervals chant a kind of chorale that either
tells us what will happen or comments on what did happen. Sometimes their
text sounds Biblical, sometimes like a Greek chorus, sometimes in
word-cycles almost worthy of Gertrude Stein. But they chant it like Daleks.
Brechtian humanity is missing.
Meanwhile the scenes that occur in the centre of the stage show us society
reduced to its most empty. Men, when asked where they have come from, answer
'Wherever we've come from, think of it as Hell's back yard.' When one woman
says to another 'Have you no shame?', the other replies 'How would I know? I
haven't had it touched in years.' Everyone seems to be commenting on
themselves even while they are in the middle of things. Brechtian irony is
never absent. But the text keeps drawing attention to its own literary style
 -'I am to them a foot, no more,/ That dangles from its ankle, dead . . .' -
and the actors keep end-stopping in mid-sentence to show us how Brecht's
language consists of lines.
There are also expressionist effects that strike me as un-Brechtian. The set
is composed of barren earth. Early on, the two women are seen lying,
immobile and face down, on this earth; when they make efforts to rise, they
promptly fall back splat to the ground. This obvious metaphor, straight out
of the German movement theatre of such people as Pina Bausch - as are the
heeled shoes the women wear - is too leaden to succeed in Brecht, as are
several other heavy symbols.
Should Brechtian theatre be alienating to this degree? And should alienation
be this boring? For oh, this production keeps hitting you like a dull cosh -
for 90 minutes, with no interval. The seven actors belong to Primitive
Science, a company founded by von Henning last year and focusing on
20th-century European theatre. The production makes you feel less like a
theatregoer than a student.
At the Gate Theatre, W11. Ends February 5.

FT  19 JAN 94 / Arts: A trip down Quantity Street - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY

<TEXT>
Still they come, the new series for the 1994 new year season. In the whole
history of British television - scarcely a half century, admittedly - there
cannot ever have been so many series launched in such a short period.
Television is still expanding, and even though none of the programmes
mentioned here today was provided by a cable or satellite company (apart
from news and sport the amount of original material coming from these new
sources is virtually nil, which may explain why their share of total viewing
is still only 6.5 per cent across the nation as a whole) the development of
cable and satellite has nevertheless intensified the competition among
terrestrial broadcasters. So has the government's tough attitude towards the
BBC and its insistence that ITV be run like a whelk stall.
The result, even if you leave aside such trivia as game shows and soap
operas, is a cascade of new programmes so intense that it makes logistical
problems for a column such as this. In the past two weeks in this space I
have reviewed, however briefly, the drama series Broadway Stories,
Smokescreen, A Dark Adapted Eye, The New Adventures Of Superman and 99-1;
the comedies Health And Efficiency and Comic Asides - The High Life; the
factual series Art Of Conducting, Auction and Nomads Of The Wind; and
Jonathan Meades' brilliant but uncategorisable Further Abroad.
Still queueing for review are the following series, none of them fresh
batches of old titles, all of them genuinely brand new:
Family Watch presented by the oleaginous Robert Kilroy-Silk.
Network First which ITV is putting in place of such memorable documentary
series as First Tuesday and Viewpoint.
An American comedy called Flying Blind which contained in the opening
episode the lines 'That's my idea, a communion wafer with a sort of toffee
flavour' and 'You mean that my ability to delay my orgasm for two hours
counts for nothing?' Try it tonight at 12.10 on C4.
Scotland Yard, a documentary series indistinguishable from the last six
about the police.
Just A Minute which may be enjoyed by those who liked it on radio, though
perhaps not.
The Great British Garden Show which is equally concerned with flower and
vegetable shows and gardening.
A bizarre American conjuring series called The Unpleasant World Of Penn And
Teller.
A series on Scottish arts called The Bigger Picture presented by Billy
Connolly.
John Mortimer's drama series set in a London auction house, Under The
Hammer.
All Quiet On The Preston Front, a drama series about the Territorial Army.
A Channel 4 documentary series about police in Pakistan, Karachi Kops.
A BBC1 current affairs series with the unnecessarily pessimistic title
Living With The Enemy about parents and teenage children.
Another BBC1 drama series, this time featuring management recruitment:
Headhunters.
A half-hour magazine programme which attempts to handle complex concepts
such as Big Bang theory in a popular manner, probably doomed: Big Science.
Yet another transfer from BBC Radio, Fantasy Football League, in which
'celebrities' act as managers and 'buy' soccer players, gaining points
according to what these players do in real life: narcoleptically boring
except to football's version of train spotters.
A drama series called NYPD Blue which has the most explicit sex scenes to
emerge from American television, and
A slow, underpowered and old fashioned comedy vehicle for Penelope Keith,
Law And Disorder, in which she plays a barrister.
Then of course there is the BBC2 drama, set in a small town in the 19th
century, in which everyone gallops around on horses though the railroad is
coming: the locomotive steams to the end of the line to deliver the sleepers
for the next bit. The town is riven by factions made up of the banker and
his cronies, landowners, and a young doctor with modern ideas who has just
ridden in from the east. The women, who wear bonnets and bustles and ride
side-saddle, are treated as mindless little things waiting for a handsome
stranger to arrive on the stagecoach, and the men congregate in the saloon
to gamble and drink. Not the wild west, of course, but Middlemarch.
The parallels are not merely coincidental. Americans have used the western
as a means of considering their national heritage, social structures,
political difficulties, sexual mores, and collective ambitions. Judging from
the opening episode of this adaptation by Andrew Davies, Middlemarch will
prove to have many of the same concerns.
It looks wonderful: from the heath scene in the opening shot which was
worthy of Constable, to the honeymoon scenes in Rome, from the costumes to
the hospital interiors, this is the BBC at its most painstaking and
authentic. Some of the country's best actors - Michael Hordern, Patrick
Malahide, Elizabeth Spriggs - are as good as you would expect, and the
unknowns - especially Juliet Aubrey as Dorothea - are better than we are
entitled to expect and will not be unknown for long.
Davies, whose position as top drama adaptor on British television is
currently unassailable, has managed to make it sound as though Eliot wrote
the dialogue for television. This is, in other words, a splendid example of
what we are always being told the BBC ought to be doing. And yet . . . in
the past Davies has created his own series such as A Very Peculiar Practice,
and if ever it came to a choice between another adaptation from 19th century
literature and a Davies original I would not need to ponder a second before
opting for the Davies.
The list above is not even exhaustive, so we can hardly complain about the
amount of new material we are being offered; probably no audience anywhere
has ever been offered more. Yet we can and should protest about the type of
material. Staying with drama as our example, there is a bleak absence of
passion, personal communication, and vision. However high the production
values in Under The Hammer, All Quiet On The Preston Front, 99-1,
Headhunters and NYPD Blue - and they are mostly very high indeed - these are
all clearly formula works which have been created to win ratings.
Though there was certainly pleasure in watching this week's yarn in Under
The Hammer, about a puritanical wife who chucked the nude-adorned silver
salt into the lake in Cromwell's time and today's killjoy wife who followed
with the Petrus '61 (all topped off by John Wells' cosy little cameo as the
obit vulture) you could never mistake it for something that Mortimer felt he
had to write . . . unless of course his accountant insisted.
Similarly with NYPD Blue, and the story of the ageing cop with an obsession
and a dangerously regular date with a prostitute, there was never any sense
that creator Steve Bochco had any purpose more serious than repeating the
success of his previous series, Hill Street Blues. It is slick and watchable
and passes an hour effortlessly, but it has no challenge to make, nothing
fresh to say, no determination to engage with the viewer.
As for Headhunters and All Quiet On The Preston Front, they look as though
they could have been made to fulfil quotas. We have had dramas built around
oil men, bankers, psychologists (and of course policemen; 99-1 is yet
another police series which, contrary to the impression conveyed by Episode
1, appears now to be simply more of the same old crime guff) and somebody at
the BBC must have flicked through a careers book and realised there had
never been a series about headhunters. Unfortunately the most interesting
aspect of the opening episode was Francesca Annis's accent which swung
alarmingly from French to American and back.
Drama series about life in the Army and the RAF have also appeared in the
last couple of years, so the Territorial Army hardly comes as a surprise.
But All Quiet On The Preston Front is another series which shows no
indication of a desire to do more than attract good ratings.
More television may be better than less if it means more choice, but in this
new age of market driven broadcasting it seems ominously clear that the
increase in quantity is going to be at the cost of quality.

For once the waterfall of publicity preceding a new series is justified. The
Day Today is yet another example of Radio 4 serving as a forcing house for
television comedy. The radio series 'On The Hour' is wickedly funny because
it mocks other programes not for their content but their style. It does this
with such accuracy that the listeners' reaction programme, Feedback, has
received letters of complaint which assume 'On The Hour' is the real thing,
whatever the week's target: news, sport, religion and so on. Now producers
Armando Ianucci and Chris Morris and impressionist/comedian Steve Coogan
have brought the idea to television and tonight's targets include sports
round-ups and those ghastly 'video boobs' programmes (9.00 BBC2).
That is followed by Part 2 of Middlemarch in which Dorothea's marriage,
doomed from the outset, gets stickier, and young Dr Lydgate discovers his
enemies when he becomes head of the fever hospital (9.30 BBC2). Building
Sights USA at 8.50 on BBC2 features Frank Lloyd Wright's 'Ennis-Brown
House'.

FT  19 JAN 94 / People: Sir Christopher adds to his collection
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Christopher Harding, the former chairman of British Nuclear Fuels, will
be able to indulge his passion for collecting egg cups in his new job as
chairman of the Prince's Youth Business Trust.
The Prince of Wales has asked Sir Christopher to take on the chairmanship of
the PYBT which helps young unemployed people start their own businesses. To
mark the appointment the PYBT has invited its young entrepreneurs to make an
egg cup for the new chairman. So far over 30 have accepted the challenge.
Sir Christopher, 54, takes over in June from Sir Allen Sheppard, chairman of
Grand Metropolitan, who has done the job for four years.
Although the PYBT is one of at least ten philanthropic ventures sponsored by
the Prince of Wales, it is felt to be the one closest to his heart. He has
described it as the 'largest seed corn agency in the world'. It spends about
Pounds 9m a year helping 3,000 young people with direct financial support.
It also assists a further 25,000 by counselling and 7,000 in continuing
care. It has a staff of 220 and 5,000 part-time volunteers. Sir Christopher
hopes to double the number of young people the PYBT helps start up in
business.
Sir Christopher has been on the PYBT's advisory council since 1988. However,
his decision to add yet another chairmanship to his increasingly busy
schedule is slightly surprising given that only last week he said he would
be reducing some of his other commitments following his appointment as
chairman of Legal &amp; General. He is already non-executive chairman of BET and
Newarthill and sits on the boards of Hanson, English China Clays, Slough
Estates, GEC and joined the board of the Post Office last month.

<TEXT>
Brian Pearse, who steps down as chief executive of Midland Bank next March,
and Malcolm Bates, deputy managing director of GEC, have joined the
government-sponsored Private Finance Working Group which was set up at the
end of last year.
The addition of the two new names to a body whose aim is to coax private
sector investment into public sector projects will help calm initial fears
that the body would be dominated by civil servants. Eurotunnel's Sir
Alastair Morton, who chairs the new group, has also decided not to invite
any financial advisers from the City to sit on the group. He says he did not
want to inhibit the flow of views from as wide a variety of City sources as
possible.
Apart from Sir Alastair, Pearse and Bates, the other members of the group
are: Howard Davies, CBI director general; Allan Gormly, chief executive
Trafalgar House; Pen Kent, associate director Bank of England; Sheila
Masters, partner KPMG Peat Marwick; Neville Simms, chief executive Tarmac;
Bob Dobbie, head of the Department of Trade and Industry's industrial
competitiveness division; Gordon Greenshields, director of finance NHS
management executive; Peter Mackay, secretary Scottish Office industry
department; Steve Robson, deputy secretary (industry) HM Treasury; David
Rowlands, principal finance officer Department of Transport, and Eugene
Turton, deputy secretary (housing and urban) Department of the Environment.

FT  19 JAN 94 / Business and the Environment: Finns on a limb - Finland's
forestry industry is taking a beating over its management methods
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Finland's forestry and paper industry has been shaken by accusations from
abroad that its forest management methods are destructive and its paper
mills environmentally unfriendly.
Last November, an article in Der Spiegel, the German news weekly, entitled
'Plunderers in the north' sent shock waves through the business community
and the government. It suggested that Finland, Canada, Alaska and Russia
were ravaging their ancient forests with mechanical tree harvesters.
Finland's forestry industry, not surprisingly, has rejected the accusations
against it. And there are mutterings in Helsinki about 'environmental
imperialism' by countries which seek to impose standards on others. Finland,
people point out, has had a forestry conservation law on its statute books
for decades.
But Finns also have enough experience of the suddenness and force of
environmental campaigns to know that their largest industry - wood, pulp and
paper products account for 36 per cent of Finnish exports - would be in
serious danger if these claims gained strength, particularly since they
affect every stage of the paper-making process.
'The market pressures are driven by feelings, not facts,' says Heikki Sara,
senior vice-president of United Paper Mills, one of the country's biggest
paper companies. 'It is very important for us to have equal and predictable
regulation. This is a very capital intensive business and it takes years to
change.'
The tremors have reached Jyvaskyla, a forestry town in central Finland
where, as in most of the country, the bulk of the forest is owned by private
individuals, but where unemployment is 20 per cent, making any attack on
forestry a threatening prospect.
Kaj Karlsson, director of the woodlands department of Metsaliitto, a large
forestry co-operative, says it is pointless for foreign critics to demand
that Finland protect its ancient forests. 'There is hardly any original
forest left in Finland,' he says. 'That was cut down long ago. What we have
now is new growth forest.'
Pauli Ahola, a private farmer who owns 360 hectares, fears foreign pressures
will lead to a ban on clearcutting. The alternative - harvesting by thinning
 -would be much more laborious and would render his business uneconomical,
particularly with timber prices at their current depressed levels.
Even so, the government recently extended protection to 23,000 hectares of
state-owned old growth forest. But it cannot afford to extend this to
private farms because there is no money to compensate the owners for lost
production.
A point laboured by the Finnish forestry industry is that the replanting
rate exceeds the annual harvest by a large margin, and that Finland now has
more forest than at any time in its recorded history. But Tony Juniper,
habitats campaigner at Friends of the Earth, says it is not sufficient to
look at sustainability only in terms of whether the forest stock is growing.
Finland's forest management methods, with their replacement of the original
growth with trees for industrial use, have threatened species and reduced
bio-diversity, he says.
Down the road from Ahola's farm, at the large Kangas paper mill, Pasi
Ahonen, the customer service manager, is anxious to keep his share of the
German market, where environmentalists have demonstrated outside publishing
houses suspected of using non-environmental paper. His company has invested
heavily in cleaning up its plant and reducing the use of chlorine as a
bleaching agent to meet foreign demands.
'To get into the German market, you have to be totally chlorine-free,' he
says. 'But that adds 5 to 10 per cent to the cost.' Until recently,
chlorine-free paper commanded a price premium in the central European
market. But recession has wiped that out.
But while production methods have been attacked, they can, at least, be
remedied. A more deadly threat to Finland's paper industry comes from
foreign pressure to raise the share of recycled paper. For example, the
European Union recently agreed recycling targets, and Belgium is introducing
an eco-tax to promote re-use of waste products.
This not only threatens to undercut Finland's leading export product -
virgin pulp paper - but also challenges it to get hold of enough recycled
paper to plough back into production to meet other countries' content
requirements. With a population of only 5m, but enough paper production to
supply a country eight times its size, locally generated waste paper meets
only a fraction of industry needs.
Ironically, therefore, Finland now imports waste paper from abroad. One
Finnish company, the state-owned Enso-Gutzeit, has even built a recycled
newsprint plant in Germany in order to be closer to the supply of waste
paper.
Pertti Laine, the vice-president for industrial and environmental policy at
the Finnish Forest Industries Federation, says that recycling is now the
biggest economic issue for the industry. He is supporting a campaign to
promote incineration as an acceptable alternative to recycling or
landfilling. Frequent recycling quickly wears out pulp fibres and adds to
costs - and you are still left with a waste problem, he says.
On his desk is a brown-grey block of what looks like rubber. It is
compressed paper, the product of a technology to transform waste paper into
a usable fuel. Paper has almost the same calorific value as coal, he says,
and produces carbon to grow more trees. 'The Finnish plan is not cradle to
grave, but cradle to cradle,' he says, using the environmentalist's product
life cycle terminology. Finland claims to be one of the few countries in the
world which absorbs nearly all the carbon it produces.
However, the industry's attempts to rebut criticism have yet to convince the
sceptics. Heidi Hautula, one of the 10 Green Party members of parliament,
says the Spiegel article gave a much-needed impetus for change. 'Up to now,
the industry was only concerned with its image. Now it sees a need for
action,' she says.
She also wants action from the government: a redrafting of the forestry law
to cover leisure uses and protect bio-diversity, limitations on the use of
ploughing and pesticides, and so on. Her position is sensitive because such
measures would add to the industry's cost and regulatory burden at this
difficult period.

FT  19 JAN 94 / Business and the Environment: Germans question suppliers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Germany's publishers are stepping into the environmental fray after pressure
from campaigners to improve the management of forests from which trees are
cut to make paper for newspapers and magazines.
Late last year, Axel Springer - publisher of Bild, the daily tabloid, Die
Welt and several big regional newspapers and national magazines - fired off
a lengthy questionnaire to its paper suppliers on their forest management
policies.
The subjects covered by the 17 questions included tree cutting methods, use
of insecticides, species protection and bio-diversity, and forest ownership.
The answers yielded information which Springer, the biggest newspaper
concern in Germany, has published in a 140-page document for its readers and
advertisers.
Springer's action, unique in Germany, followed a campaign by the Hamburg
office of Greenpeace which opposes many of the practices of the paper
suppliers, especially clear-cutting. Greenpeace says it welcomes Springer's
initiative and expects others to follow suit.
Publishers like Springer are aware of their readers' concern about
environmental issues. Its questionnaire was aimed at communicating the
strength of this feeling to its suppliers in Finland, Sweden, Norway,
Austria, Germany and Canada.
All answered the questionnaire, in which Springer made no threats about
future contracts. 'When an important paper buyer does something like this,
it sends out signals,' says Florian Nehm, Springer's environmental
representative.
The company will draw up other questionnaires on such aspects of papermaking
as plant emissions and use of chemicals.
Publicly, the papermakers have reacted calmly. 'I can understand the action
of the Springer company very well, being under such pressure from
Greenpeace,' says Knut Kringstad, responsible for environmental affairs at
Norske Skog, the Norwegian paper manufacturer. 'It was a very natural thing
to ask suppliers how they run their forests.'

FT  19 JAN 94 / Business and the Environment: Castle casts a chemical spell
 -A UK cement maker is turning waste into fuel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Close to Pendle Hill, the bare limestone outcrop where the celebrated
Lancashire witches are purported to have cast their spells, Britain's second
largest cement manufacturer has been working on its own brew.
Castle Cement, which supplies about 3m tonnes of cement annually in the UK -
about a quarter of the country's production - has developed a formula to
turn waste industrial chemicals into a safe fuel at its Ribblesdale works.
The fuel is used to fire kilns which bake limestone and clay to produce a
clinker which is ground to produce cement.
Castle says its new product, called Cemfuel, could cut its energy costs by
up to 30 per cent. It has reduced the company's sulphur dioxide emissions by
20 per cent and nitrogen oxides by 50 per cent.
In spite of some local protests about burning a fuel derived from chemical
waste, the process has been approved by the pollution inspectorate, which
has been involved with the project throughout. Peter Weller, general manager
for Castle in charge of the development, says there has been no increase in
halogens, metallic and hydrocarbon emissions or dioxins as a result of the
experiment.
The company, which has invested Pounds 1.5m in the project, expects a
pay-back within three years. It says that US companies, which have developed
similar formulae, burn up to 80 per cent industrial wastes in their kilns,
although it does not expect to achieve this rate in the UK.
The waste chemicals used in Cemfuel are hydrocarbons, including solvents,
mostly produced by pharmaceutical, chemical, paint and printing ink
companies. The fuel is supplied to Castle's recipe by the solvent recovery
companies Solrec, CMR and Safety-Kleen. The cement company is paid to use
the fuel. If the waste materials were not converted to Cemfuel they would
have to be disposed of expensively by being burned in an incinerator or
buried at a landfill site.
Cement kilns operate at more than 1,400'C compared with 1,100'C for waste
incinerators. Tests initially involved the company burning 25 per cent
Cemfuel to 75 per cent traditional coal fuel. It is now experimenting by
burning half waste-derived fuel to half coal.
Cement manufacturers have worked hard in recent years to reduce costs by
closing uneconomic plants and cutting labour forces. Filter presses have
been introduced to remove the higher water content found in chalk which had
made it more costly to process than limestone.
Sophisticated electronic temperature and moisture controls have also been
installed to reduce manufacturing costs during the worst recession to hit
the UK construction industry for more than half a century.
Energy accounts for a quarter of the price of a tonne of cement, prompting
companies to investigate alternative fuels in a bid to reduce overheads
further. Castle has also used petroleum coke, widely used in the US as a
substitute for coal. German cement manufacturers burn a wide range of
detritus in kilns including domestic waste, says Castle. Paper sludge is
burned in Denmark while some US companies burn rice husks.
Castle, which is owned jointly by Aker of Norway and Euroc of Sweden, says
that chemical industry waste has the potential to supply up to 150,000
tonnes a year of the new fuel, although it does not expect it will be able
to obtain all of this.
Castle consumes about 400,000 tonnes of solid fuel annually. In total, UK
cement manufacturers burn about 2m tonnes a year. Weller says: 'The aim has
been to reduce costs in the most environmentally beneficial way possible. It
is very pleasing that we have been able to achieve this objective so
successfully.
'There are a number of possible fuels which could be used in kilns.
Continuity of supply is as important as the energy and environmental
efficiency of the fuel.'

Halifax, the UK's largest society, announced last September that it was

The society, which used headhunters in its search for a managing director

FT  19 JAN 94 / Jobs: Turn of the tide is confirmed - Why changes in
executive employment may cause upheavals in housing and pensions markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Three cheers are nowhere near enough for the Jobs column's present writer to
call for this morning. The reason is that, with only two weeks to go before
giving way to my successor and heading for retirement, I would much rather
hand over on a rising tide than on the ebb.
Hence the breathless hush that awaited the latest executive-demand
statistics was not due entirely to my addicted smoking. Five solid years of
decline in the United Kingdom market are scarcely conducive to optimism, and
though July-to-September last year had shown an upturn, it was slight enough
to have been blotted out by a renewed plunge in October-December.
Then up came the new figures from the M S L International consultancy, and .
. . Whoopee]
The results, which refer only to job-offers which are advertised in UK
national journals, are summarised in the table alongside. First we have the
number of posts offered in eight broad types of executive work. The broadest
by far is the 'Others' category which sweeps together such people as buyers,
company legal staff, economists and variegated consultants. Each opening is
counted as one, by the way, no matter how many times the advertisement for
it appears. Next comes the annual total, which is broken down below into the
quarterly tallies.
As may be seen, the tide is rising, albeit from much the lowest low recorded
since MSL began its three-monthly checks on the advertised demand 35 years
back. Even so, it is not only the increased total which provides
encouragement; more is to be found in the counts for the separate types of
work above it.
What prompted my previous scepticism about a sustained rise was that the
small upturn shown by the September figures was fuelled by year-on-year
increases in only two of the eight work categories: sales and marketing, and
computing. All the rest were still sliding downwards.
Now, happily, the position has been reversed with six on the rise and only
two sinking, of which production has plummeted to only about a quarter of
the record high of 7,589 which it reached in 1988. But there is less cause
for gloom in the still falling counts for personnel shown by the table,
which probably underestimate the true strength of demand. That is because -
unlike other categories, in which the national journals checked by MSL are
the standard medium for advertising executive-level vacancies - most
openings in personnel are offered through the professional press.
Moreover, there are further heartening signs in the separate counts MSL
makes of demand in four particular industrial sectors. All were up last year
on their 1992 figures. The smallest of the increases was just over 8 per
cent to 774 jobs in energy and related industries, compared with 17 per cent
to 579 posts in what used to be termed 'food, drink and tobacco', but in the
interests of political correctness has now been reduced to 'food and drink'.
Retailing did better with a 58 per cent rise, even though to only 758
openings in total. Best of the lot was the high-tech field which leapt by 83
per cent to 1,847.
On the whole, therefore, it looks as though my successor will be bringing
you cheerier news than I have done this past half-decade. Nevertheless,
while it's to be hoped that the demand will never again plumb such depths, I
doubt that it will ever again rise to even near the 40,202 tally of 1988. My
suspicion is that, in the UK at least, executive employment has undergone
severe and permanent shrinkage, whose ramifications will be far-reaching.
One close observer who agrees - seeing housing and pensions, particularly,
as likely to feel the effects - is Jack Daniels. He is director of the
careers service at the University of St Andrews, and over the years the Jobs
column has come to regard him as Britain's foremost salesman of the services
of new graduates.
The reason is that, although his ancient university has the disadvantages of
being small and off the beaten track except for golfers, its degree-winners
have consistently done better in the jobs market than those of the great
majority of the other UK universities. But he tells me that St Andrews's
consistent success conceals radical changes in the pattern of graduate
recruitment.
One of them is that short-term contracts, often of only a year, are fast
replacing the open-ended employment that used to be the rule. Meanwhile
degree-winners have less chance of any job with a big organisation straight
after university. Instead they are increasingly having to make their way in
the world for a couple of years on their own resources, since fewer and
fewer employers will consider them until they have already had work
experience.
'That means a drop, not just in the number joining pensions schemes in their
early 20s, but in the number with the steady income expectations needed for
a mortgage,' said Mr Daniels. 'So there might soon be a trend away from
home-ownership in favour of rented accommodation, and what effects might
that have on the housing market?'
The Jobs column groaned inwardly . . . thinking of the house that it will
soon need to sell on moving out of London.

FT  19 JAN 94 / Management: Whistleblower's cautionary tale - Jim Smith's
allegation of contracting irregularities was vindicated, yet he lost
everything
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The parliamentary report paper is yellowing with age, but Jim Smith
treasures its contents as if they referred to events which happened
yesterday. The text outlines his efforts to expose defence contracting
irregularities that helped the UK government recover more than Pounds 1m in
over-paid profits and led to changes in contracting procedures that saved
millions more.
Smith has little else to treasure. Identified as a whistleblower, he is now
a corporate outcast because he used insider knowledge, gained as a director,
to alert authorities to questionable practices at his company.
When his allegations of excess profiteering from defence contracts were
highlighted by the Public Accounts Committee in the mid-1980s he was hopeful
of receiving some compensation and picking up the pieces of a shattered
career.
Today he is penniless, evicted from his home of 20 years, ostracised by
companies that once courted his talents, ignored by a government that valued
his help and all but forgotten by the professional bodies to which he
belonged.
'I did what I knew to be professionally and ethically right. I cannot halt
the suffering. Losing the house was terrible,' he says.
Smith's story is particularly relevant at a time when there is growing
anxiety in the UK about unethical corporate behaviour. Public Concern at
Work, the recently established charity which advises whistleblowers, said in
a report this week that a third of the calls to its office during its first
month of operation concerned corruption and potential fraud.
Smith's case demonstrates that even when an individual's claim is vindicated
and he is supported by apparently powerful organisations, he can still be
abandoned and forgotten. At one stage in his campaign for government
compensation, for instance, he had the support of more than 300 MPs who
signed an early day motion calling for government compensation. That
all-party support and the recommendation for compensation from the PAC,
however, failed to move the Ministry of Defence, which had benefited most
from his actions.
The Institute of Directors (IoD) - of which he is a member - and his
professional body, the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (Cima),
also backed him but the campaigning subsequently ran out of steam.
Smith's fate seemed unimaginable 42 years ago when, as a young
school-leaver, he joined the family company that became Ferranti
International as a trainee accountant. Within four years he was working with
senior directors planning the company's financial future.
He became expert at methods of defence contracting and helped the company
over one of its most difficult times in the 1960s when it was forced to pay
back excess profits on a contract for Bloodhound missiles. In that case,
Smith believes the profits had been fairly earned but the company was
anxious to keep on friendly terms with the MoD. 'I learned then what damage
could be done to a company by an inquiry into its costing methods,' he says.
After joining the board of a US-owned, UK-based defence company he first
encountered what he considered unethical behaviour. He had raised about
Pounds 1m through the MoD's progress payments system to help company
cashflow on specific contracts, but the US parent wanted to use the cash
elsewhere. Smith alerted the MoD and the payments were postponed.
By this time he had left to set up a company doctoring service which advised
companies on cash flow. In 1974 he was approached by John Heywood, an
ex-management colleague at Ferranti who had become the chief executive of
the Horstmann Gear Group. Smith helped the group purchase a UK defence
company, Aish, based in Poole, Dorset, and became a director in the same
year. Shortly afterwards, he found evidence of over-pricing in a contract
won by Aish. He insisted that it was rectified and the figures adjusted in
the accounts. He estimated the company would have to pay back Pounds 1m to
the MoD.
Smith says his approach had the support of Heywood, Aish's chairman, who he
says also wanted him to make the position clear to the MoD. The chairman was
absent on sick leave, however, in June 1981, when Smith was called to a
group board meeting to ratify a set of accounts which did not allow for the
overpayment. 'When I refused they frog-marched me out of the building, held
in an arm lock. I was instantly dismissed,' he said.
Aish told the PAC that Smith was made redundant because his specialist
expertise was no longer needed and that Smith had lost an unfair dismissal
claim - and subsequent appeal - at an industrial tribunal. The company also
said it had approached the MoD about the excess profits before the ministry
was passed evidence by Smith.
Heywood, the one man in the company powerful enough to persuade the board to
reverse its decision, died three weeks after the meeting. By this time Smith
had met with MoD officials and outlined the problem contracts. He says the
company only admitted the overpricing two years later when the tribunal was
about to hear his unfair dismissal claim.
This last point was accepted when Smith took his case to the PAC in
parliament. His stance was vindicated when it published a report supporting
his action and calling for a 'hot line' to encourage whistleblowers to
report malpractice in defence contracts. Aish repaid Pounds 421,000 to the
MoD and a further Pounds 600,000 was deducted during price renegotiations.
An MoD investigation in 1983 decided there was insufficient evidence of
criminal activity and that it was a matter for contractual redress.
The MoD may have tightened its procedures but it did nothing to help Smith.
He says his former customers no longer used him as a consultant for fear
that it could upset their relationship with the MoD. 'As soon as you are
branded a whistleblower you have an uphill battle to be compensated because
people think you are a sneak but that wasn't the case at all for me. It was
the people who did the dirty on me that forced the issue. I had been tasked
to ensure they did not do anything amiss. I did the right thing.'
Losing the industrial tribunal, unusually heard in camera, was perhaps the
most severe of Smith's setbacks. Another blow was evidence from MoD
officials refuting his contention that he had raised the matter a year
before any approach by the company. The discrepancy in the evidence was
never reconciled. Nevertheless, Sir Gordon Downey, then comptroller and
auditor general in 1985, concluded: 'Mr Smith's allegations clearly had a
significant impact on the volume and effectiveness of MoD's post costing
activity with this firm.'
There remains a feeling among some who helped Smith at the time that he was
badly treated but that avenues which might have put right the wrongs have
been exhausted. Andrew Hutchinson, principal research officer at the IoD,
said his organisation tried to help Smith. He says: 'We did our best to
encourage his creditors to be reasonably lenient with him on the grounds
that he had been put into this position through acting on principle.'
He adds: 'I could see no particular reason to suppose that the situation was
anything other than what he had alleged. It had all the appearance to me of
a fairly good civil service snow job.'
Cima admits it might have done more to help. A note left by an official in
the case file says: 'The institute was simply not in a position to champion
Smith's cause.' Bunny Warren, assistant secretary, who was not an official
at the time, says the institute was not wealthy enough. 'He was up against a
big company which would have been prepared to take senior legal advice and
be represented to make sure they didn't lose the case.' He says the
institute provided loans and grants to Smith and was unlikely to pursue them
for repayment. It is also paying a weekly sum that is kept low so that it
does not affect payment of his state benefit. 'If you look at it in the hard
light of day I suppose we should have done more,' says Warren.
The only new interest now comes from Public Concern, which wants to revive
government interest in Smith's case. Guy Dehn, director of Public Concern,
says: 'If anyone in the US had done what he did they would have been paid a
very large sum of money. They certainly wouldn't have been dismissed and
ruined.'
Smith's experience, though, is not untypical of whistleblowers. In perhaps
the most famous example, Stanley Adams was awarded Pounds 200,000
compensation from the European Commission after he exposed illegal
price-fixing by Hoffman La Roche. His whistleblowing led to a suspended
one-year jail sentence under Swiss industrial espionage laws in 1976 after
the suicide of his wife who had feared a much more severe sentence.
According to a survey of 87 whistleblowers in the US six years ago some 17
per cent of them lost their homes, 8 per cent filed for bankruptcy, 15 per
cent filed for divorce and 10 per cent attempted suicide.
Aish itself was sold by Horstmann and became Widney-Aish. Michael Windsor,
current executive chairman of Horstmann, says he knows little about the
case, but comments that no good had come of it for the company.

FT  19 JAN 94 / Management: Consult across Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Judging by the latest UK Management Consultancies Association survey, the
market for consultants continues to mirror economic recovery. But what sort
of work are clients demanding?
One admittedly anecdotal answer was offered this week at a meeting in London
of the members of ECN, an alliance of eight national management consultancy
companies with offices in 10 European countries. ECN, whose combined fee
income of about Pounds 50m last year puts it among the top 20 European
players, claims mutual servicing of customers among its companies,
multinational projects and the exchange of know-how make it more than just a
routine consultants' lunch club.
What was striking at the meeting was the different regional experience. The
two Scandinavian firms, for example - Carta Corporate Advisers of Stockholm
and Sami of Helsinki - have found that there is a strong strategic bias in
their territories as companies seek to expand internationally. This was not
the picture elsewhere in Europe.
In Germany, said IBB International of Cologne, the demand for expertise in
linking organisations from east and west after unification is now tailing
off. 'Cost optimisation' work of the kind familiar to the UK in the early
1990s is of greater interest.
In France and the Benelux countries clients are increasingly seeking to
quantify the returns from using consultancy services. In France there is
growing interest in innovation, while the significance of the public sector
has increased in the Benelux countries.
As for the UK - where the ECN member is the accountancy firm Stoy Hayward -
managing director Michael Grunberg says the 'catchphrase remains process
re-design', though he says people differ on whether this refers to
incremental improvements or a complete re-design.

FT  19 JAN 94 / Car sales forecast to surge in 1990s
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Car sales will be boosted strongly during the 1990s by an increase in the
total of single-person households and the numbers of cars per household, a
MORI poll of more than 1,700 motorists indicates.
Motorists' buying intentions over the next two years, examined by MORI as
part of its research for the annual Lex Report on Motoring, indicate a
relatively quick return to annual sales of more than 2m cars last seen at
the end of the 1980s. The record of 2.3m car sales in 1989 may be broken by
the end of the decade.
After 1989 the UK market underwent its steepest postwar recession, plunging
to 1.59m within two years. It recovered more strongly than expected last
year to 1.78m.
Lex Service, the vehicle importer and distributor that controls more than
100 dealers in the UK, yesterday launched its annual report by predicting
growth to 1.9m sales this year.
MORI's findings reinforce a belief at Lex that this year's recovery could
again outpace expectations to reach sales of 2m. MORI's research found that,
for the first time in three years, surveyed drivers expected the number of
cars in their households to rise. Some 40 per cent of households currently
have more than one car. If MORI's research is borne out, the average will
rise from 1.54 cars per household now to 1.6 in two years time. When the
increase in the number of households is included, there is the potential for
700,000 extra sales per year on top of 1.5m replacement car sales.
The report finds little evidence of a shift away from company cars as a
result of the tax changes due on April 6.

FT  19 JAN 94 / Mirror special offers rapped
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Advertising Standards Authority yesterday criticised Mirror Group
Newspapers for misleading readers over special offers designed to increase
newspaper sales.
The authority's monthly report, published yesterday, details three
complaints upheld against the Daily Mirror, bringing the total of similar
complaints upheld against the group to eight during the past 12 months.
Mirror Group's 'continuing failure to conform to the requirements' of the
British Codes of Advertising and Sales Promotion Practice was 'deprecated'
by the authority. It said it was important for newspapers and magazines to
stick to the codes because publishers were part of the system of advertising
control.
The first of the latest complaints concerned a front-page item that stated:
'Big Mac free for every reader'. The promotion did not make it clear to
readers before they bought the newspaper that they would have to collect
tokens over several days, the authority said.
The second complaint concerned an offer of four free bottles of Sol beer. It
had not been made clear that tokens had to be collected, the authority said,
or that they had to be redeemed at Asda stores.
The third complaint was over an offer of 100,000 free tickets to see the
film Jurassic Park. The authority said the offer had failed to explain how
the tickets would be allocated.
Mirror Group argued that readers would understand that the first two offers
would be subject to further conditions, and that promotional material in the
third made clear that not all those applying would receive free tickets.
A claim by the Health Education Authority that rainforest trees are burnt in
the growth and production of tobacco was 'inadequately substantiated', the
Advertising Standards Authority ruled.
The claim, which appeared in advertisements in the HEA's youth magazine, was
objected to by the Tobacco Advisory Council and the International Tobacco
Growers' Association.

FT  19 JAN 94 / UK to share in Hercules project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE and PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lockheed, the US aerospace group, said yesterday UK companies would make up
to 15 per cent of its proposed new version of the veteran Hercules transport
aircraft, the C-130J.
Launching a campaign to secure a Royal Air Force order for 30 new Hercules
for Pounds 750m-Pounds 900m, it said the UK share would be roughly the same
as on the rival European project, the Future Large Aircraft.
British Aerospace is lobbying for government backing for the European
venture.
Lockheed and its UK partners estimate the UK would obtain Pounds 1.2bn of
work from the C-130J programme on a 'conservative' forecast of 400 sales
worldwide, 'significantly more' than the value of the UK purchase. They
claim the programme would support 1,500 British jobs in the high-technology
industry.
The RAF has about 60 older-model Hercules. The Ministry of Defence, which is
expected to decide by the end of the year whether to refurbish or replace
half of this fleet, is due to invite a formal bid from Lockheed shortly.
Lockheed has so far signed up 18 UK companies for the project, including
GEC-Marconi, Hunting, Westland, Lucas and the TI subsidiary Dowty, which
will manufacture the propellers.
The UK companies have already invested about Pounds 70m in the programme, in
which Lockheed is investing about Pounds 200m.
Lockheed is looking to the UK as the lead customer for the four-engined
aircraft, which is outwardly similar to the previous Hercules in service
since the 1960s.
Other customers include Australia, with an initial requirement of 12 new
aircraft, New Zealand and Saudi Arabia. The US is also believed to have a
requirement for about 250 aircraft to replace older Hercules transports.
British Aerospace, which fears it will be forced out of the European FLA
project if the UK government continues to refuse to back it, is understood
to have declined an invitation to join the Lockheed programme.
However, Mr Gordon Williams, chairman of Hunting Aviation, part of the
Lockheed consortium, said yesterday the C-130J project was not in conflict
with the FLA.
The European aircraft would be a contender to replace the second batch of
RAF aircraft, he said, but would not be available until about 2003. The
Lockheed aircraft was 'the only realistic contender' for the first batch,
expected to be required in 1996, he said.
The new C-130J would have a 35 per cent greater range than its predecessor.

FT  19 JAN 94 / Farmers seek new path to market: Deborah Hargreaves hears
why the potato board is under fire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Graham Solari, a West Midlands farmer, lavishes tender loving care on the
3,000 tonnes of early potatoes he grows each year to ensure they attain high
standards. He takes equal pride in knowing what his customers want.
'We've spent two years talking to our customers: they want white potatoes
that look nice, are fresh and are the right shape,' he says.
Mr Solari describes his tubers as 'canting' potatoes, an old Black Country
expression. 'It means you can put the potatoes on to boil, hang out your
washing and cant to the neighbour for an hour, and when you're back the
potato is still boiling away and hasn't disintegrated.'
He is proud of his own marketing skills and is adamant he needs no
centralised body to do the job for him. He is one of at least 400 producers
who have signed a petition calling for an immediate end to Britain's Potato
Marketing Board.
Changes to the potato board, which has controlled production for 60 years,
were announced in November by Mrs Gillian Shephard, agriculture minister.
She said the board would be phased out over three years, but in the meantime
it would act as a central research and marketing agency.
But a growing number of farmers want the board abolished now. 'There's
nothing the board does for me that I can't do better myself,' says Mr
Solari, who pays Pounds 5,000 a year for membership out of his Pounds
320,000 turnover on potatoes.
The rebel growers have collected enough names in opposition to the board to
force it to hold a national poll on its future. They hope this will be held
within weeks.
Mr Solari thinks farmers should become closer to consumers themselves rather
than relying on a central agency to do it for them.
He says: 'There are a lot of smaller producers who think that, in some
magical way, the potato board will rescue them if they're inefficient.
That's just not going to happen.'
Mr Solari has this year's seed potatoes sitting in plastic trays in
insulated buildings on his 150 acres. Each stage of their growth is
carefully monitored.
Mr Solari uses 13 workers and a potato harvester to grade, sort and pack the
potatoes, en route, in the hope they remain as fresh as possible when they
arrive in the shops.
Last year he made a good profit but the drive for quality came after a loss
in 1992 when the market was oversupplied. 'We cut back our production by
1,000 tonnes to make sure we could concentrate more on quality,' he says.

FT  19 JAN 94 / TUC complains over union rights
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain is likely to be condemned by this year's conference of the
International Labour Organisation in Geneva over alleged breaches of
international conventions on union rights, the Trades Union Congress said
yesterday.
The latest complaint from the TUC concerns clauses in the Trade Union Reform
and Employment Rights Act that came into force last autumn.
Mr John Monks, TUC general secretary, has written to the ILO arguing that
the act violates its convention 87 on freedom of association by imposing an
obligation on a union to admit individuals or groups to membership whether
it wants to accept them or not. He also complains about the act's provisions
that further limit the right to strike.
The second complaint covers the recent failure of the government to reach an
agreement with civil service unions to lift the 10-year ban on unions at the
government's GCHQ communications headquarters at Cheltenham.

FT  19 JAN 94 / Society resumes pension transfers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Yorkshire Building Society, the 12th-largest society in the UK, is
re-entering the pension transfers market with a service offering customers
independent actuarial advice, Alison Smith writes.
The service, which will be available from the end of this month, comes
against a background of widespread failure across the financial services
industry to comply with regulatory requirements in cases where people
transferred savings out of occupational pensions schemes into private plans.
A study by accountants KPMG Peat Marwick for the Securities and Investments
Board, the City's chief watchdog, found that regulatory guidelines were
breached in nine out of 10 pension transfer cases.
Yorkshire's service will link the society with Buck Consultants, an
independent firm of actuaries. Under the arrangement, Yorkshire will make
the initial contact with a customer and will then take him or her through a
questionnaire.
For a flat fee of Pounds 75, Buck will then assess the benefits from the
occupational scheme and the investment returns required for higher benefits.
It will then prepare an actuarial report to go to both customer and building
society. This will include a statement recommending whether the customer
should take the transfer value or not. If the advice is to transfer out of
the scheme into a personal plan, Yorkshire, which is one of the few larger
societies to act as an independent financial adviser, would hope to advise
the customer.
Buck said its usual fee for a similar service would be about Pounds 150.

FT  19 JAN 94 / Aid for Malaysia 'was linked to arms sale'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Written evidence suggesting Mrs Margaret Thatcher's government linked a big
aid package to Malaysia with the sale of British arms has been unearthed in
Whitehall in the wake of the political row over the Pergau dam project.
Mr John Major yesterday vigorously defended his role in giving final
approval in 1991 to the financing of the controversial project to build a
Pounds 300m hydro-electricity station on the banks of Malaysia's Pergau
river.
Earlier this week Sir Timothy Lankester, permanent secretary at the Overseas
Development Administration, said he had opposed the decision as a waste of
taxpayers' money.
But he was overruled by Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, following
consultations between Mr Hurd and Mr Major. They were advised by government
lawyers that the deal did not involve a breach in the law, which prevents
overseas aid being used directly to purchase arms.
In 1989 the Thatcher government agreed to finance the Pergau project a few
months after signing a Pounds 1bn framework accord on military sales. The
Foreign Office has consistently denied that the two deals were linked.
Government policy prohibits any link between aid offers and weapons
contracts.
But it emerged yesterday that while the denials have been accurate in a
strict sense, the government did in early 1988 tie the offer of a large aid
package to the prospective arms deal. The Pergau scheme, though not
mentioned specifically at the time, was eventually financed from this
package.
Documents detailing the link have been uncovered by officials in the
Ministry of Defence and the Foreign Office. Other minutes detail direct
contacts between Downing Street and the Malaysian government.
The papers, potentially deeply embarrassing, pre-date a formal letter sent
to the Malaysian government in July 1988 which said the offer of aid and the
prospective arms deal were not tied together.
It is understood that the letter, sent by Lord Younger, then defence
secretary, reflected official concern that the earlier papers represented a
breach of government policy.
Civil servants had been particularly alarmed by the relaxed attitude about
any link adopted to the issue by officials in Mrs Thatcher's Downing Street
office. The letter was sent to provide a public defence against charges that
the rules had been broken.
Mounting criticism of the deal raised the possibility yesterday that the
Commons foreign affairs committee may launch an investigation. The public
accounts committee is already conducting its own inquiry but its powers and
remit have so far prevented it from exploring in detail the links between
aid and arms sales to Malaysia.
Mr Major made clear in the Commons yesterday that he had felt it impossible
to renege on an agreement signed by his predecessor. He also defended it as
vital to Britain's industry and exports.
Mr Peter Shore, a Labour member of the foreign affairs committee, said that
the affair was 'bound to be raised at the next meeting of the foreign
affairs committee'.
He said that Mr David Howell, the committee's chairman, had reported to the
committee that he would be unable to take part in any sessions on the Pergau
dam project because he is an adviser to one of the companies involved.

FT  19 JAN 94 / Treasury to face critics from industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Senior Treasury officials are to meet 70 industrialists next month to answer
charges that they are too secretive and have become divorced from the
business community.
The private meeting has been arranged for the Treasury by the Whitehall and
Industry Group, a little-known charity funded by the government and 64 big
companies.
It comes as part of a broad effort by the Treasury to seek better contacts
with business people after criticism that it had made mistakes in economic
policy partly because it has not known enough about the world outside
Whitehall.
On the agenda will be ways of ensuring Treasury officials understand how
economic policies affect companies - for example in investment allowances
and efforts to attract private capital into government programmes. Senior
Treasury officials think this process can be achieved by more swapping of
staff between Whitehall and business.
The gathering at the Institution of Civil Engineers in London is being
billed as a no-holds-barred session in which participants will be asked to
speak bluntly.
Among those attending are Mr Robert Armitage, finance director of the UK
division of US drugs company Merck, Mr John Mayo, finance director of
Zeneca, Mr Keith Todd, ICL finance director, and Mr Clive Hopkins, finance
director of Shell UK. Other companies being represented include Marks and
Spencer, Kingfisher, IBM, British Petroleum, Royal Bank of Scotland, British
Aerospace, and Texaco.
The Treasury case will be put by a quartet of top officials led by Sir Terry
Burns, permanent secretary.
Mr Christopher Haskins, the chairman of Northern Foods, who has attacked the
Treasury as being cut off from industry, will give an address aimed at
pulling together criticism of the department.
Others to speak include Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the
Treasury, Mr Rupert Pennant-Rea, deputy governor of the Bank of England, and
Mr John Watts, Tory chairman of the Commons Treasury and civil service
committee.
The other Treasury officials who have agreed to face a possibly hostile
audience include chief economic adviser Mr Alan Budd, and Mr Andrew Turnbull
and Mr Steve Robson, in charge of public spending and industry respectively.

FT  19 JAN 94 / Pay freezes may affect 2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nearly 2m employees may be covered by pay freezes, the Confederation of
British Industry says.
The CBI's latest Employment Affairs Report says its pay databank suggests
that a quarter of manufacturers and a sixth of service companies are
operating pay freezes.
The organisation also stresses that there is little sign of 'catching-up'
awards when freezes end. Settlements after a pay standstill, at 2.1 per cent
in the private sector, compare with an average of 3.4 per cent for all
settlements last year.
The CBI cites several cases - including a distributor and retailer in the
south-east with a turnover of Pounds 100m and 1,200 employees. The
distributor had to cut costs as trade dwindled, and introduced a 12-month
wage freeze.
The CBI said: 'The freeze was followed by a 1.5 per cent award but there was
no element of catch-up.' Job vacancies at executive level rose sharply in
the fourth quarter of last year, according to the latest jobs survey by MSL,
the recruitment consultants. Recruitment for high-technology jobs was up by
142 per cent compared with the fourth quarter of 1992, while there was
growth of 156 per cent in retailing management jobs.

FT  19 JAN 94 / Shop crime hits morale and profit: 1.2m customers and 28,000
staff detained in connection with offences
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Retailers' profits would have been 23 per cent higher last year without the
growing problem of retail crime, the British Retail Consortium said
yesterday.
The consortium, which represents 90 per cent of UK retailers, said its first
comprehensive survey of retail crime revealed that the true cost of crime to
retailers was about Pounds 2bn a year.
That was more than the cost of running the magistrates' courts system for a
year, and almost twice the annual cost of running the Crown Prosecution
Service.
The survey found a total of 2.1m criminal incidents in the retail industry
including 1.5m customer thefts. The consortium warned that 'small retailers'
profitability and morale can often be so affected by crime that continued
trading is no longer viable'.
The 120,000 incidents of criminal damage - or 54 for every 100 shops -
compares with only eight in 100 individuals who have their cars vandalised
each year, and seven in 100 whose homes are vandalised.
The survey's other main findings included:
Almost 3,700 arson attacks.
More than 14,400 robberies.
More than 31,000 incidents of theft or fraud by staff. Pounds 21.7m losses
to retailers through fraud using payment cards, cheque cards and other
means.
More than 7,000 incidents of terrorism, including confirmed incidents and
hoaxes.
Incidence of burglary was highest for grocery stores (95 per 100 stores).
Retailers detained 1.2m customers and 28,000 staff in connection with
crimes, but dealt with 450,000 of these themselves, without passing them on
to the police.
Many retailers do not bother to hand over shoplifters because of the slim
chance of a conviction under the present system. But the consortium said the
answer was not necessarily tougher laws or a clampdown on shoplifters.
'If every shop thief was handed over to the police, the whole criminal
justice system would grind to a halt,' said Mr James Mays, director-general.
He added that there were ways in which retailers could improve their
co-operation with the Crown Prosecution Service to increase the arrest rate
of persistent and professional shoplifters, and make sure they were
'prosecuted to the full extent of the law'.

FT  19 JAN 94 / Advertising Standards Authority rules HEA claim
'inadequately substantiated'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A claim by the Health Education Authority that rainforest trees are burnt in
the growth and production of tobacco was 'inadequately substantiated', the
Advertising Standards Authority ruled in its monthly report.
The claim, which appeared in advertisements in the HEA's youth magazine, was
objected to by the Tobacco Advisory Council and the International Tobacco
Growers' Association. The HEA said it had evidence that some
tobacco-producing countries were responsible for de-forestation.
Last month a complaint to the Advertising Standards Authority from the HEA
led to Imperial Tobacco, the Hanson subsidiary, scrapping its advertising
campaign for Embassy Regal cigarettes.

FT  19 JAN 94 / Scottish industry in upbeat mood
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The mood of businesses in Scotland is continuing to improve as the Scottish
economy emerges gently from recession, says the latest quarterly Scottish
Chambers Business Survey.
The manufacturing and wholesale sectors reported the fastest rises in demand
in the last quarter of 1993 compared with the previous one. The construction
industry also showed increased optimism, while retailing and tourism were
more cautious about prospects.
Orders taken by manufacturing companies rose, especially from the domestic
market, a further sign that the Scottish economy is improving.
Scotland suffered far less than southern England in the recession.
Unemployment, now 9.2 per cent on a seasonally adjusted basis, fell below
the UK average two years ago for the first time since records began in the
1920s. It remained lower last year.
The survey, which is analysed by the Fraser of Allander Institute of
Strathclyde University, the economic forecasting body, showed investment by
manufacturers in plant and machinery continuing to rise.
Employment fell in most sectors in the fourth quarter of 1993 and
recruitment also dropped, though this is normal for the time of year. There
was even evidence that companies had difficulty recruiting labour in some
sectors, and little sign of them increasing their training provisions.
The downward trend in employment in the financial sector, which has been
consistent over the past three years, became steeper in the last three
months of 1993. The decline in employment affected full-time staff much more
severely than part-time or temporary staff, the Fraser of Allander Institute
said.

FT  19 JAN 94 / Building society returns to pension transfers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Yorkshire Building Society is re-entering the pension transfers market with
a service offering customers independent actuarial advice.
The new service, which will be available from the end of this month, comes
against a background of widespread failure across the financial services
industry to comply with regulatory requirements in cases where people
transferred savings out of occupational pensions schemes into private plans.
A study by accountants KPMG Peat Marwick for the Securities and Investments
Board, the City's chief watchdog, found that regulatory guidelines were
breached in nine out of 10 pension transfer cases.
Yorkshire's service will link the society with Buck Consultants, an
independent firm of actuaries.
Under the arrangement, which has been worked out over the past six months or
so, Yorkshire will make the initial contact with a customer and will then
take him or her through a questionnaire.
For a flat fee of Pounds 75, Buck will then assess the benefits from the
occupational scheme and the investment returns required for higher benefits.
It will then prepare an actuarial report to go to both customer and building
society. This will include a statement recommending whether the customer
should take the transfer value or not. If the advice is to transfer out of
the scheme into a personal plan, Yorkshire, which is one of the few larger
societies to act as an independent financial adviser, would hope to advise
the customer.
Their usual fee for a similar service would be about Pounds 150, Buck said.
Mr Derek Roberts, Yorkshire chief executive, said yesterday that the society
hoped 'to bring some order to the marketplace'. He believes that people are
more likely to trust advice from a society than from elsewhere in the
financial services industry.
Yorkshire, the 12th-largest society in the UK, has given financial advice to
around 50,000 customers, but has only 300 pension transfer cases. Its
customer base is about 1m. It stopped writing pensions transfer business
early last year.
Yorkshire decided to re-enter the market because the question of what to do
with a pension from previous employment loomed so large in its discussions
with customers about personal pensions.
One of the issues thrown up by the inquiry into pension transfers has been
that sales agents and advisers seek enough information about the
occupational scheme, on issues such as discretionary benefits, to ensure
that they can give proper advice on whether a customer should take a
transfer.

FT  19 JAN 94 / Rail freight wins Pounds 43m aid package
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A package of measures designed to improve the viability of rail freight and
to encourage private operators to run freight services is to be announced by
the government today.
Grants to encourage companies to set up private freight terminals and to
switch freight from road to rail are to be increased fourfold to Pounds 43m
over the next three years.
The government is also to auction off surplus freight locomotives and
rolling stock to companies which want to enter the freight market.
Details of the government's plans will be unveiled by Mr Roger Freeman,
transport minister, in a speech to the Chartered Institute of Trans-port.
Mr Freeman is also expected to announce that a regulation raising the
permitted weight of lorries delivering to rail terminals from 38 gross
tonnes to 44 gross tonnes will be put to parliament before the end of
January. It should become law by the time freight shipments begin through
the Channel tunnel in March.
The total grants of Pounds 43m to boost rail-freight shipments start at
Pounds 13.3m in 1994-95 and rise to Pounds 15.4m in 1996-97. This money
comprises the freight-facilities grant, an existing subsidy to help private
operators set up rail terminals, and the track access grant, a new subsidy
to help rail-freight operators meet charges for the use of track.
The freight-facilities grant, which was previously applied to freight
removed from urban roads and single-lane carriageways, has been extended to
cover dual carriageways and motorways. It will be calculated on the basis of
5p per lorry mile saved.
The Rail Freight Group, a lobbying organisation representing nearly 100
users of rail freight, transport companies and equipment manufacturers,
welcomed the increase in grant but questioned the wisdom of spreading it
fairly equally over the three years.
The group said that if the first year's access grant were fully taken up,
and committed for subsequent years, there would be none available for
companies applying in years two and three.
It also said the decision to extend the scheme to motorways was welcome,
though the mileage allowance was only half of what it had been hoping for.
The auctioning of surplus BR stock was also crucial to the entry of new
freight operators, the group said. But it was important that usable assets
were put up for sale and not just locomotives and rolling stock which were
ready to be scrapped.
Freightliner, British Rail's loss-making domestic container business which
has been offered for sale, has attracted a good level of interest from
potential private buyers, Mr Freeman said. Government subsidies to this
company would continue.
Trainload Freight, the profitable BR division which ships basic commodities
such as coal, steel and building aggregates, is to be split into three
regional divisions from April, transformed into companies in September and
privatised in 1995.

FT  19 JAN 94 / Record payout for RSI injury
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A former Inland Revenue typist has been awarded a record Pounds 79,000 in
compensation after losing her job because of repetitive strain injury.
The out-of-court settlement agreed with lawyers acting for the Inland
Revenue Staff Federation comes after a High Court judge ruled last year that
RSI was 'meaningless'.
Mrs Kathleen Harris, 47, from west London, was forced to leave her Pounds
11,000-a-year job in July after suffering for two years from tennis elbow,
which she claimed was brought on by using an electric typewriter.
She is now registered as disabled and is unable to do housework such as
ironing, vacuuming and cleaning.
'She can't even pick up a 1lb bag of sugar,' said Mr Simon Allen, a
solicitor acting for the union. He said the case had established that RSI
genuinely existed as a term for a number of work-related injuries.
The union has 150 more Revenue cases in the pipeline.
In an October ruling, rejecting a claim for damages by a Reuters journalist,
Judge John Prosser suggested the term RSI had 'no place in the medical
books'.
IRSF general secretary Mr Clive Brooke, announcing the compensation award
yesterday, said the settlement was a 'strong rebuttal of the mistaken view
that RSI is just something in the mind'. He added: 'The judge is out of
touch with the pain and reality of life that many workers are suffering.'
Mrs Harris said: 'I just hope it helps other people with the same problem.'
Her case, said Mr Allen, was related to posture, a lack of breaks from
typing between 13,000 and 16,000 key strokes an hour and the general
inadequacy of her furniture.
Mr Brooke blamed the injuries on a tendency in typing pools for managers to
'crack whips'. He said: 'We believe much of this stems from increasing
drives by employers for more and more output and higher and higher
productivity. There is a role for trade unions to ensure that those who seek
profitability regardless of the consequences on their employees should be
constrained.'
The previous highest settlement for an RSI case was an award of Pounds
59,000 in 1992 to a former Vauxhall machine operator. A TUC analysis last
month showed that unions had won Pounds 118,000 for RSI sufferers in
November and December.
The Revenue said it had been making efforts to improve furniture and had
begun educating staff about ergonomics.
Dr Peter Buckle, head of ergonomics at the University of Surrey, said the
settlement highlighted the fact that the Reuters case was a 'bad judgment'.
The settlement would relight some of the cases that had been 'doused' after
Judge Prosser's remarks, he said.

FT  19 JAN 94 / Hurd to address Foreign Office staff on job cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER, Diplomatic Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, is taking the unprecedented step of
addressing a meeting of his department's entire London-based staff to try to
reassure them about the size of redundancies, career prospects and pay.
About 1,000 people are expected to attend next Monday's meeting, said to be
the first of its kind in the Foreign Office.
It is due to be held in the Durbar Court, the restoration of which was
undertaken under Mr Hurd's predecessor, Sir Geoffrey Howe, now Lord Howe.
The court has been used mainly for diplomatic receptions.
The meeting is taking place at the request of the Diplomatic Service's
Whitley Council, which represents the various trade unions and has expressed
increasing anxiety about the future of the staff at a time of financial
retrenchment in all government departments.
The Foreign Office was characteristically vague about details, saying only
that Mr Hurd had agreed to give 'a general address to the staff which will
focus in part on management and administrative issues'.
It is no secret, however, that the department will have to make staff cuts
as a result of financial constraints imposed by the Treasury, and the
planned cuts have had a demoralising influence. Other developments, such as
the market-testing programme of several Foreign Office departments to see
whether they could operate as privatised agencies, has also worried staff.
Though the meeting has been billed as a general address by the foreign
secretary, it would be surprising if civil servants did not take the
opportunity of asking Mr Hurd some searching, and possibly embarrassing
questions about career prospects and pay.

FT  19 JAN 94 / National curriculum cost total of Pounds 469m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Implementing the national curriculum in England and Wales cost the
government Pounds 469m from its introduction in 1988 until April last year,
it was revealed yesterday.
Since Sir Ron Dearing, chairman of the Schools Curriculum and Assessment
Authority, started his review last April about Pounds 35m has been spent on
attempting to implement national curriculum tests, which were widely
boycotted by teachers' unions.
Sir Ron has now recommended radical reductions in the curriculum's content.
It is to be cut by 20 per cent up to the age of 14 and virtually abandoned
after that.
Mr John Patten, the education secretary, said in a written parliamentary
answer that the total cost was Pounds 469m.
This included almost Pounds 100m attributed to the National Curriculum
Council, which devised the curriculum, and to the Schools Examination and
Assessment Council, which devised the tests to assess it.
Most of the planned tests have now been abandoned, and children will only
face compulsory testing on the core subjects of English, mathematics and
science at the ages of seven, 11 and 14.
Mrs Ann Taylor, shadow education secretary, claimed this meant that more
than Pounds 500m had been wasted.
She said: 'The Dearing process has been a costly exercise in finding out
what we already knew: that the Tory national curriculum was nothing of the
sort. It was an attempt to impose a national syllabus and has involved waste
on a massive scale.'
The bulk of the expenditure was paid to schools directly in grants for the
general education support programme.
However, these costings do not include any estimate of the cost in terms of
lost teacher time spent filling in 'tick-lists' for pupil assessments rather
than teaching. Sir Ron has urged teachers to 'burn their tick-lists'.

FT  19 JAN 94 / Cleveland to be replaced by four unitary councils
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS and CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cleveland County Council is to be abolished and replaced by four all-purpose
unitary authorities, Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, announced
yesterday.
Local businesses reacted furiously to the move, which is the first formal
decision to be made by the government on restructuring a mainland county
since the review of English local government structure was announced by Mr
Michael Heseltine, then environment secretary, in 1991.
Mr Gummer said the new structure would 'bring the benefits of unitary local
authorities to Cleveland: better service delivery, more efficient and
effective local government and - most importantly - one door to knock on,
making the council as accountable as possible to local people'.
Sir Ian Wrigglesworth, northern region chairman of the Confederation of
British Industry, said: 'Businesses won't have to knock on one door, but on
three council doors in the Teesside conurbation, and the doors of quite a
number of joint organisations which will run services across the whole
Teesside area.'
Ratepayers, he said, would have to pay the bill for a less efficient system
than could have been put in place. The CBI has lobbied for three districts
to be merged to form a Teesside unitary council, with Hartlepool left as an
independent unitary authority.
The leaders of all three political parties on Cleveland County Council
renewed their call for Teessiders to 'rise up in protest' at an 'impending
disaster'. The announcement was welcomed by the four Cleveland district
councils.
The option chosen by Mr Gummer is in line with the recommendation by Sir
John Banham, chairman of the Local Government Commission.
Cleveland County Council has already applied for judicial review of Sir
John's recommendations, claiming they are 'ill-considered, unwanted and
expensive'.

FT  19 JAN 94 / National curriculum cost Pounds 469m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Implementing the national curriculum in England and Wales cost the
government Pounds 469m from its introduction in 1988 until April last year,
it was revealed yesterday.
Since Sir Ron Dearing started his review of the curriculum last April, about
Pounds 35m has been spent on attempting to implement national curriculum
tests, which were widely boycotted by teachers' unions.
Sir Ron has now recommended radical reductions in the curriculum's content.
It is to be cut by 20 per cent up to the age of 14 and virtually abandoned
after that.
Mr John Patten, the education secretary, said in a written parliamentary
answer that the total cost was Pounds 469m.
This included almost Pounds 100m attributed to the National Curriculum
Council, which devised the curriculum, and to the Schools Examination and
Assessment Council, which devised the tests to assess it.
Most of the planned tests have now been abandoned, and children will only
face compulsory testing on the core subjects of English, mathematics and
science at the ages of seven, 11 and 14.
Mrs Ann Taylor, shadow education secretary, claimed this meant that more
than Pounds 500m had been wasted.
She said: 'The Dearing process has been a costly exercise in finding out
what we already knew: that the Tory national curriculum was nothing of the
sort. It was an attempt to impose a national syllabus and has involved waste
on a massive scale.
'Mr John Major claims to be going back to basics. Sir Ron has gone back to
the drawing board. John Patten, for all our sakes, should go back to the
back benches.'
The bulk of the expenditure was paid to schools directly in grants for the
general education support programme.
However, these costings do not include any estimate of the cost in terms of
lost teacher time spent filling in 'tick-lists' for pupil assessments rather
than teaching.
Sir Ron said he was shocked by the 'tick-list' system which required a
typical teacher to make 20,000 separate reports on pupils each year. He
urged teachers to 'burn their tick-lists'.
Sir Ron will answer questions from the Commons education select committee
today, where the question of the cost of the national curriculum is likely
to be raised again.
Baroness Blatch, the education minister, said Labour and the Liberal
Democrats 'arrogantly dismiss our emphasis on the basics in education as
'the product of fanatical doctrine' - that's how out of touch they are with
the aspirations and instincts of the British people'.
She said the government had employed 'bold, imaginative and much-needed
reforms'.

FT  19 JAN 94 / Westminster suspends policy on house sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS, STEWART DALBY and PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Westminster council yesterday suspended its 'designated sales' housing
policy following last week's allegation that councillors and officials had
'gerrymandered' the 1990 election.
Mr Miles Young, Conservative leader of the council, said he was 'erring on
the side of over-scrupulousness' but hoped to bring in a new designated
sales scheme soon.
Mr Neale Coleman, a former Labour councillor who co-ordinated the campaign
against the policy, said that over-scrupulousness was 'a recent discovery by
Westminster's Conservative group'.
An emergency meeting of the council has been scheduled for January 25 to
discuss the report, but Mr Young said the debate was 'likely' to take place
in camera.
The meeting has been called because the council has been told by the Audit
Commission that the composition of its committees is constitutionally
'defective'. The work of all committees, central to policymaking by
councillors, has been suspended, and the council must reconstitute them at
Tuesday's meeting.
So far, the suspension of designated sales is an 'executive action' taken by
Mr Merv Montacute, the council's managing director, and must be endorsed by
the council meeting.
Mr Peter Bradley, Labour's deputy leader on the council, attacked the
decision to hold the meeting in camera. He said: 'This is a matter of
unprecedented public interest, and we should be able to find a mechanism
through which as much of this can be debated publicly as possible. Many of
these issues have arisen precisely because there was inadequate public
scrutiny of Dame Shirley Porter and other Conservative councillors.'
The ruling Conservative group on the council also announced that Ms Judith
Warner, one of the 10 councillors and officials the auditor said in his
provisional view should be surcharged for involvement in the affair, has
resigned as chairman of the education committee 'to devote her time and
energy to clearing her name'.
Mr Young, who was not recommended for surcharge by the auditor, said: 'I and
my colleagues strongly believe in designated sales as an arm of our overall
housing strategy. However, a detailed reading of the district auditor's
report raises so many new and fundamental legal issues for us that I believe
the scrupulous response must be to review the basis of the policy as it is
currently constituted.'
Labour believes that the policy will not return. Mr Coleman, a former Labour
councillor, said: 'Clearly they have read the same documents as we have.
They know the game is up. The case that the policy was unlawful is
overwhelming beyond words.'
The council also announced that it had severed contacts on housing matters
with Mr Jeremy Sullivan, the lawyer who has advised the authority since 1987
on its controversial council house sales policy.
A spokesman for Mr Sullivan said the lawyer could be affected by a
'potential conflict of interest' if he continued to act on behalf of the
council during the continuing inquiry by the district auditor. However, Mr
Sullivan will continue to work for the council on other cases, and
Westminster made clear that they still had full confidence in him.

FT  19 JAN 94 / Major mounts counter-attack
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major yesterday sought to deflect continuing attacks on his
government's moral standing by accusing the opposition of spreading 'smear
and innuendo' without regard for truth.
The allegations followed claims by Mr David Winnick, Labour MP for Walsall
North, that voters were concerned about 'financial sleaze' prompted by
government policies.
'The one 'back to basics' attitude people so desperately want - crave for -
is simply the restoring of integrity to public life,' Mr Winnick told MPs at
question time.
Mr Major said Labour MPs should 'look at their own colleagues, who spread
smear and innuendo on a week-by-week basis with complete disregard for the
truth.
'Smear and innuendo are the hallmark of political cowardice and they have
become the trademark of the opposition,' he told cheering Conservative MPs.
The prime minister's supporters said his comments marked the beginning of a
determined attempt to regain the political initiative after the
embarrassments of the past two weeks.
Officials released a list of seven alleged Labour smears from a file kept by
researchers at Conservative Central Office.
The most serious relates to claims by Mr Clive Soley, a Labour backbencher,
that the Saudi royal family made a Pounds 7m donation to Conservative party
funds via Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary.
The allegation, which was made under the protection of parliamentary
privilege, has never been repeated outside the Commons.
A senior Conservative official said Mr Major had been angered by opposition
attacks on the government's moral standing, including a weekend interview in
which Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, described ministers as 'ruthless,
arrogant, hypocritical and deceitful'.
The official said that the alleged smears were 'clear examples' of the
Labour party making allegations without evidence.
The list, however, was dismissed as 'pathetic nonsense' by Labour. Officials
said there would be no relaxation of attempts to embarrass the government.
Mr Frank Dobson, Labour's transport spokesman, renewed claims that Sir
Norman Fowler, Conservative party chairman, had refused to answer questions
about the relationship between Mr Gerry Malone, the party's deputy chairman,
and Mr Asil Nadir, fugitive head of the collapsed Polly Peck empire.
Mr Dobson released a letter to Sir Norman seeking confirmation that Mr
Malone had a meeting with Mr Nadir while he was on bail pending trial on
theft charges.

FT  19 JAN 94 / Rules on relocating homeless to ease
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government will tomorrow publish plans for easing the requirement on
local authorities to rehouse homeless families in permanent accommodation.
Under the proposals, homeless single mothers with children would no longer
be given priority for local-authority or housing-association homes.
Councils would instead be able to house homeless families in temporary
accommodation such as flats owned by private landlords. Local authority and
housing association homes would be allocated to those in greatest need,
including those already housed who need larger accommodation.
The move follows a promise to review the allocation of housing to the
homeless made by Sir George Young, housing minister, at the Conservative
party conference in October.
Sir George told the conference that it was hard to explain to a young couple
who wait for a home before starting a family 'that they cannot be rehoused
ahead of the unmarried teenager expecting her first, probably unplanned,
child'.
Speaking at a housing debate organised by Roof magazine, Sir George
yesterday repeated the government's commitment to providing a safety net for
vulnerable people such as homeless single mothers.
But he said that homelessness should not necessarily mean priority for
getting local authority or housing association homes.
Increasing the supply of housing for rent was the key to tackling
homelessness, the minister said. He added: 'I see no reason why the private
sector shouldn't play a far greater role in helping the homeless.'
The plans were condemned as 'indecent, unpleasant and amoral' by Mr Jack
Straw, Labour's environment spokesman. He said they were an attempt to
punish those the government believed had acted irresponsibly.

FT  19 JAN 94 / Bank angers playwright
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Playwright Arnold Wesker, whose TV productions have included Menace and
Thieves in the Night, will soon have enough material for a gripping yarn
about high-street banking.
Mr Wesker, whose other works have included Sullied Hand and One More Ride on
the Merry-Go-Round, was appalled to be charged Pounds 90.29 by his bank for
paying into his London account a total of Pounds 600 transferred from
France.
The playwright has written to Mr Laurence Shurman, the banking ombudsman,
about his treatment by the Finsbury Park, London, branch of National
Westminster, where he has banked for 35 years.
'I've got a good record with the bank and it seems crazy that they've
charged so much: at the least they should have warned me it would cost this
amount to pay three cheques of Pounds 200 each into my account,' said Mr
Wesker.
Mr Wesker's tale of woe follows allegations from small businesses in recent
years of bad treatment by the main clearing banks. On Monday, Mr Eddie
George, governor of the Bank of England, said antagonism between the two
groups was easing, though the banks had sometimes been guilty of
'insensitivity'.
NatWest kept Pounds 45.56 of the Pounds 90.29 it charged Mr Wesker, with the
rest paying for the services of the two French banks, Credit Lyonnais and
Credit Mutuel, whose cheques were used in the transaction.
NatWest admitted the charges were high but said they were 'fair' and
'reflected the costs of fiddling with little bits of paper'. Of the total
taken, Pounds 30 was accounted for by NatWest's standard commission for
currency transactions, Pounds 5.56 by postal charges and Pounds 10 by a
handling fee.

FT  19 JAN 94 / Those other Ulster talks are on again: How attention is
shifting to an internal political settlement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With the UK-Irish peace initiative stalled, the delicate talks process aimed
at securing an internal political settlement in Northern Ireland is poised
to re-emerge from the shadows to which it has been consigned since November.
The talks, co-ordinated by Mr Michael Ancram, the Northern Ireland minister,
and involving Ulster's four main constitutional parties, have inevitably
fallen out of the spotlight while it seemed the Downing Street declaration
might persuade the IRA to renounce violence.
But now that the government has concluded that the odds are against an early
end to the 25-year republican campaign - clearing the way for Sinn Fein, the
IRA's political wing, to enter the political process - this order of
priorities is about to change.
This was signalled last week when Mr Ancram began a new round of bilateral
meetings, seeing a delegation from the largest party in the province, the
Ulster Unionists.
Yesterday he saw senior Alliance party members. Next week he is due to meet
the mainly Roman Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party.
The message to republican leaders is clear. Their hesitancy over the joint
declaration will not be allowed to delay efforts to piece together a
political settlement. After yesterday's meeting Dr John Alderdice, leader of
the Alliance party, added his voice to those calling for the government not
to wait for Sinn Fein.
Those familiar with the talks say the focus of the minister's efforts is to
pin down an agenda that would permit participants to move on from the
current time-consuming bilateral format - disparaged by some as 'blind-date
politics' - to round-table discussions.
It will not be easy. Ministers have said in the past that a resumption of
round-table talks would be counter-productive until agreement is achievable.
An earlier round-table talks process broke up without success in 1992.
The hardline Democratic Unionist party has said it will not return to the
talks process, bilateral or otherwise, until the meetings between Mr John
Hume, the SDLP leader, and Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, end.
Sinn Fein, as might be expected, is scathing about the exercise's prospects
of success. Mr Tom Hartley, the party's national chairman, says: 'I don't
think the dynamic for change can be found any more in those sorts of talks.'
Mr Ancram is thought to have identified a certain amount of common ground on
structures for devolved government in the province, including an 85-member
Ulster assembly. But less headway has been made on 'strand two' of the talks
 -how to handle relations between the province and the Irish Republic.
Ulster Unionists are keen for efforts to be focused on setting this assembly
up. But the SDLP is unlikely to consent to this without agreement on
north/south relations, and on strand three - relations between the two
governments.
Mr Hume is said to have received assurances last week that the talks process
would continue to embrace all three sets of relationships. But London is
still waiting for a paper setting out Dublin's ideas on strands two and
three which it requested last September.

FT  19 JAN 94 / Cabinet briefed on de-regulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
No fewer than 14 cabinet ministers are to attend a de-regulation seminar at
Downing Street this morning in a meeting that should assure the government's
de-regulation bill of a high-profile send-off.
The bill, to be published today, has been flagged as one of the main
elements of a legislative programme designed to unite the Conservative party
after last year's Maastricht-related traumas.
Downing Street said last night that the high turnout of cabinet heavyweights
 -headed by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Michael Heseltine,
trade and industry secretary - expected at today's meeting reflected the
'great importance' the government attached to de-regulation.
The bill, which will run to just under 100 clauses, is expected to give the
Department of Trade and Industry sweeping powers to repeal hundreds of
regulatory measures without primary legislation.
This has already led to controversy, with Mr Heseltine forced to reassure
MPs that the measures would not undermine parliament's authority.
There is expected to be provision for establishing some form of scrutiny
procedure, probably by MPs. The DTI has said there are no plans to 'avoid
public scrutiny' through the use of orders in crown procedures.
Today's meeting, to be chaired by Mr John Major, the prime minister, will
also be attended by the chairmen of the eight business task forces charged
with identifying regulations that could be scrapped after the contents of
the bill are published.

FT  19 JAN 94 / TV advertising rules to change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Independent Television Commission has decided to allow a system of
'Chinese walls' in television advertising sales following the spate of ITV
merger proposals.
This means, for example, that if Granada succeeds in taking over London
Weekend Television, it will still be able to own LWT's sales house Laser and
its 50 per cent stake in The Time Exchange, subject to stringent conditions.
The Time Exchange sells advertising for Granada, Scottish, Grampian and
Border. Laser sells for LWT and Yorkshire-Tyne Tees - in which Pearson,
owner of the Financial Times, has a stake.
Together the two sales houses account for about 40 per cent of total ITV
revenue, far in excess of the ITC's present 25 per cent limit.
A joint ownership, the ITC warns, would be possible only if neither Granada
nor LWT exercised any control over The Time Exchange nor had a director on
its board. No one from either company could even discuss business deals with
The Time Exchange. The ITC has written to four TV companies involved in
takeovers - Carlton Communications, Central Independent Television, Granada
and LWT - and intends to write to the two latest contenders MAI and Anglia,
spelling out conditions for advertising sales in future.
Copies of the letters have been sent to the Office of Fair Trading and could
be influential in the OFT's attitude to Granada's hostile bid for LWT. One
of the central issues is the effect on advertising sales of a Granada-LWT
deal.
The Incorporated Society of British Advertisers has written to the OFT
expressing concern about any further concentration in the selling of ITV
airtime. Mr Michael Grade, chief executive of Channel 4, is sceptical about
whether 'Chinese walls' can work effectively.
Last week the ITC announced a review of advertising sales rules.

FT  19 JAN 94 / Imro registration system changes
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Imro, the self-regulating body for the fund management industry, yesterday
issued a consultation document proposing rules that require individuals
employed by member firms to register individually with it.
The system is aimed at identifying individuals who are either incompetent or
who have been dismissed by their employer for wrongdoing, and preventing
them from finding employment with another firm. 'Imro believes that
investors will be better protected against wrongdoing and incompetence and
that members too will benefit through the identification and, where
necessary, removal of individuals who cannot meet the required standards,'
the body said.
The document, which invites comment by February 25, describes the mechanisms
by which individual registration will be introduced and the changes needed.
Imro said it was 'aware of the need to avoid unnecessary bureaucracy and
costs and will introduce the system with the minimum amount of complexity
and paperwork'.

FT  19 JAN 94 / Education bill faces fresh Tory protest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's education bill ran into further difficulties yesterday when
a prominent rightwing Tory MP complained that parts of the legislation
affecting student unions were not clear enough, James Blitz writes.
Mr Graham Riddick, parliamentary private secretary to Mr John MacGregor,
transport secretary, confirmed that he had written to ministers at the
Department for Education to say that the bill did not properly put into
effect the 'voluntary principle' affecting student unions.
The principle - which would allow all students to decide whether they wanted
to join a union - is strongly supported by Tory backbenchers.
However, in a letter seen by the Financial Times, Mr Riddick claims that the
bill fails to put the measure properly into effect.
The legislation, which would also create a teacher-training agency, has
faced difficulties in the Lords because many Tory peers feel that it
infringes the rights of student unions to form political organisations and
spend money as they wish.
Mr Riddick believes that the government should establish a 'Facilities
Association' which would provide core services, such as student catering,
welfare and sports facilities.
He believes that colleges would then have to 'permit the establishment of a
separate student union, to which all students should have the right
individually to belong or not to belong.'

FT  19 JAN 94 / Financial watchdog is unruffled
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The board of the Personal Investment Authority, the proposed new watchdog
for retail financial services, yesterday underlined its determination to
press ahead with the corporate governance plans that last week prompted one
of its directors to resign.
After a meeting at which it discussed the planned budget for its first year,
the board also appeared likely to retain the systems of existing bodies for
deciding what membership fees organisations should pay, instead of creating
a new basis for calculating subscriptions.
Estimates of the first-year costs are around Pounds 30m. This would suggest
higher subscription fees than those paid to existing regulators.
The PIA took the opportunity of announcing the appointment of two more
public interest directors, Sir John Bailey and Sir Terry Heiser. This
confirms that the 19-strong board will contain only nine people currently
practising within the industry, as had been planned.
It was this decision that led to the resignation from the proposed authority
of Mr Jim Stretton, deputy managing director of Standard Life, and the
statement from Standard Life that it withdrew its support from the PIA and
would favour statutory regulation.
Sir John Bailey, a former Treasury solicitor, is a director of Lautro, the
self-regulatory organisation for the life assurance industry. He chairs the
inquiry into the auditing of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce
International.
Sir Terry Heiser, a former permanent secretary of the environment
department, holds a number of non-executive directorships, including Abbey
National and Smith New Court.
Two more public interest directors have still to be recruited.
Yesterday's meeting also agreed proposals on monitoring, enforcement and
acceptance by the new regulator, which is due to come into force around the
middle of the year. The board will meet next week to discuss a draft of the
PIA prospectus.
The prospectus, to be published next month, must be approved by the
Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog, in order for
the PIA to be recognised as a regulator.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Irish government is expected to approve amendments to extradition
legislation, closing legal loopholes that have blocked the extradition of
IRA suspects to the UK from the Irish Republic.
Government officials said yesterday the cabinet would approve the amendments
this week, and that the new bill would be published before the Dail, the
parliament, resumes next week.
Extradition has been a source of friction between the British and Irish
governments in recent years, in spite of moves to tighten the laws in the
republic in 1987. For example, the possession of non-automatic firearms, as
opposed to their use, is currently a non-extraditable offence in the
republic. This was used as a successful defence in the Supreme Court two
years ago by two IRA convicts who won an appeal against their extradition to
Northern Ireland after their prison terms in the republic.
In 1991 there was a political furore in Ireland after Mr Desmond Ellis, an
IRA suspect, was extradited to the UK on charges of having conspired in the
UK to cause explosions. When no evidence was presented in court that he had
ever been in the UK, the charges were changed, breaching established
extradition procedures.

FT  19 JAN 94 / Damage in quake may far exceed Dollars 7bn high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US insurance industry warned yesterday property damage from the Los
Angeles earthquake could far exceed the record Dollars 7bn (Pounds 4.70bn)
from the 1989 San Francisco earthquake.
'The area affected is larger, more expensive homes were damaged and a larger
number of businesses were hurt,' said Ms Rhonda Ruch of A M Best.
'While we have no numbers available yet, we feel the total property damage
will far exceed Dollars 7bn and insured losses will be greater than Dollars
1bn, which is about the amount of damage caused by the San Francisco
earthquake,' she said.
However, Lloyd's of London underwriters yesterday played down the likely
impact on their business. Lloyd's said the 'final total of insured losses to
be eventually borne by the market will not have a major impact.'
One underwriter who specialises in catastrophe reinsurance for US companies
said: 'I am very relaxed about it.' The majority of Lloyd's underwriters
tend to specialise in high-level catastrophe covers. These policies would be
triggered only if an insured loss were big enough to lead US insurance
companies to claim on their own reinsurance.
'It really needs to be a loss of Dollars 5bn or more for it to have an
impact in London,' said one underwriter. Insured losses are expected to be
limited partly because of the limited take-up of earthquake cover by Los
Angeles residents. In turn reinsurers are optimistic their share of the loss
will be minimal, partly because some big US insurers have tended to buy less
reinsurance protection in recent years.
Since hurricanes Hugo and Andrew in 1989 and 1992, London underwriters
restricted the scope of coverage offered - excluding power lines, for
example, from their policies.
In contrast to the generally relaxed attitude at Lloyd's, one underwriter
sounded a note of caution, recalling that Hurricane Andrew, where losses
were originally estimated at Dollars 3bn, eventually cost insurance markets
more than Dollars 16bn.

FT  19 JAN 94 / World Trade News: Gatt condemns EU over bananas - Import
regime under fire as Latin Americans refuse to drop complaint
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A potentially embarrassing report criticising Europe's controversial banana
import regime was released last night by the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade after the collapse of negotiations intended to persuade Latin
American complainants to withdraw their backing from the report.
Contents of the report are unlikely to be made public for 30 days, but
participants confirmed yesterday that the Gatt report condemns the European
Union's preferential trading arrangements with former colonies.
The five Latin American states which last year brought a formal complaint to
the Gatt over Europe's banana import regime - Costa Rica, Colombia,
Venezuela, Nicaragua and Guatemala - have come under intense pressure from
the EU to drop their complaint. Over the past four days, all but Guatemala
appeared inclined to bow to EU pressure, which was linked to offers of
improved quota access to Europe's protected banana market.
However, at the eleventh hour the Latin Americans backed away from
compromise when it emerged it would lead to deep divisions among them.
Apart from Guatemala - which accounts for a tiny 1.5 per cent of EU banana
imports and has remained adamantly opposed to the EU proposals, it emerged
yesterday that Costa Rica, which accounts for 20 per cent of EU imports, was
also paralysed ahead of general elections on February 6.
One Latin American negotiator yesterday voiced regret that no compromise had
been possible: 'A solution is still necessary,' he said. 'If time conspired
against agreement today, then we must still aim to find a solution in the
month ahead.'
It was unclear yesterday whether the EU would keep on the table an offer
made in December to give Latin American suppliers improved quota access to
its banana market. Letters written to Latin American ministers in recent
days insisted that the offer would be withdrawn if compromise was not
reached before the Gatt panel report was released.
The deadline for releasing the report passed at the weekend. Gatt officials
agreed to delay for two days as the EU and Latin Americans sought
compromise.
A hard-hitting first panel report on the EU banana import regime was
released in July last year. This upheld Latin American complaints and ruled
that the Lome convention of preferential trading arrangements between EU
members and their former colonies could not be defended as a free trade
agreement or a customs union.
Negotiators have insisted that a Gatt ruling in favour of the Latin
Americans would be embarrassing, but otherwise a pyrrhic victory, since the
report is unlikely ever to be adopted. Gatt's rules require that a dispute
panel report is supported by all Gatt contracting parties before adoption.

FT  19 JAN 94 / Economic aftershock for City of Angels: Worst disruption may
be yet to come
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LOS ANGELES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The City of Angels seems to be bedeviled. Monday's vicious earthquake added
to the troubles of a region that has already seen its economy severely hit
by defence cuts, violent race riots in 1992 and devastating fires last
summer.
'We are a resilient people,' Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan declared in
the wake of Monday's quake, which hit 6.6 on the Richter scale and left at
least 34 dead, thousands injured and as many as 15,000 displaced from their
homes.
But as he urged residents to 'keep cool' while more than 200 aftershocks
rocked buildings and frayed nerves, the full magnitude of the earthquake's
impact was beginning to emerge.
Collapsed freeways and bridges, buckled roads, landslides and ruptured gas
and water mains have crippled the transport system of a city that relies,
possibly more than any other, upon the car. Nearly 3m vehicles use the 616
miles of freeway in Los Angeles during an average evening rush hour.
Yesterday, as many residents ventured out of their neighbourhoods for the
first time since the earthquake, huge traffic jams quickly built up.
However, with many businesses and virtually all schools and public offices
closed, commuter traffic was much lighter than normal.
Despite desperate efforts by local and state officials, it may be 'at least
a year' before portions of main highways can be rebuilt, California Governor
Pete Wilson acknowledged.
Even this estimate is probably too optimistic. In the San Francisco region
of northern California, which suffered a quake of 7.1 on the Richter scale
in 1989, portions of city freeways remain closed while repairs continue more
than four years after the event.
Unlike San Francisco, Los Angeles has little public transport to fall back
on. Rail lines were buckled by the quake, halting train services for
residents of the hard-hit San Fernando Valley.
The city's fledgling subway system covers only 4.4 miles in the downtown
area and was yesterday closed for inspection. Commuters who routinely have
coped with jammed highways now face the prospect of long-term gridlock.
Five inter-state motorways have been seriously damaged. 'You're talking
about millions and millions of vehicles and travellers who will be
impacted,' said Mr Jim Drago of the California department of transportation.
The Santa Monica freeway, a big east-west artery through the city and one of
the most heavily travelled motorways in the country, was severely damaged
when an overpass collapsed onto the street below.
The earthquake also destroyed an arching intersection of two big freeways in
the San Fernando Valley, to the north west of the city. The Golden State
freeway, the primary north-south route in the state, collapsed onto another
highway, crushing several cars.
Questions remain about why so many roads, supposedly built to stand severe
earthquakes, should have collapsed. So far there are few answers, but the
state faces massive costs if it is to strengthen the system further.
The quake's destructive force could have a serious long-term impact on the
region's already battered economy. In the past year, job losses in southern
California roughly equalled those of all the US's other states combined,
said Mr Robert Arnold, a senior economist at the centre for the continuing
study of the California economy.
The freeway disruption can only make matters worse, said Ms Genevieve
Giuliano, a transport expert at the University of Southern California. 'It's
a huge problem for commercial traffic. The fact that so many places are
affected will interrupt commerce in all sorts of ways.'
Long distance truckers, who carry freight to and from Los Angeles, said that
the damage would add two hours or more to their journeys, raising costs
significantly.
Although damage from the quake is largely limited to the north-west section
of Los Angeles, nobody in the city has escaped its wrath. At Los Angeles
International Airport yesterday, airlines struggled to maintain their
schedules with many staff members unable to get to work.
The tourist trade, normally a pillar of the local economy, is expected to be
hit hard. The earthquake could be yet another deterrent to visitors who have
seen the city scarred by fires and riots.
Water and electricity supplies, although restored in many areas, remain
uncertain. All residents have been warned to boil tap water for drinking.
With most shops closed, obtaining basic supplies remains difficult.
Some inevitably profit from others' losses. Roving crews were charging shops
and businesses as much as Dollars 1,000 to board up broken windows.
Already, insurance companies have posted claims adjusters in the region. As
many as 60 per cent of residents of the affected regions lack any earthquake
insurance, according to the Personal Insurance Federation of California.
Since the 1989 San Francisco quake, state measures have been enacted to
ensure that earthquake insurance is more widely available in California.
However, its cost has risen sharply and the extent of coverage available has
been limited, deterring many home and business owners.
With insurance payouts not expected to cover much of the damage, the
prospects for a short-term economic recovery seem bleak. In Oakland, hard
hit by the San Francisco quake, many damaged commercial buildings were
simply abandoned by their owners. 'Once people realise that buildings aren't
coming back and customers start to leave, you get a cycle of decline,' said
Mr Ezra Rapport, Oakland deputy city manager.
The one big hope for Los Angeles is federal aid. City and state officials
have been encouraged by President Bill Clinton's promises to assist the
region and are now hoping for a multi-billion infusion of funds from
Washington.

FT  19 JAN 94 / World Trade News: Iran gas deal eludes Italian consortium
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A L2,000bn (Pounds 791m) plan by an Italo-Japanese-Russian consortium to
develop Iran's South Pars gas field has fallen through because Sace, the
Italian export credit guarantee organisation, has refused to cover the deal.
Roughly half the contract was to be carried out by Italian companies led by
Saipem, the engineering and pipeline subsidiary of Eni, the state oil
concern.
The Japanese and Russian partners included Mitsubishi and Machinoimport.
Together they have failed to come up with the required 85 per cent of the
financing, and the National Iranian Oil Company, responsible for the
remainder of the funds, has dropped the project - at least temporarily.
Sace declined to extend further cover to Iran, where its current exposure is
over L6,000bn.
The collapse of the deal underlines the changing role of Sace in providing
cover for large overseas projects in countries with political risk.
In the past Sace has been a passive arm of Italian foreign and industrial
policy. The organisation was especially used to backing big
engineering/public works contracts in countries from which Italy imported
oil and gas. Particular beneficiaries were state-owned groups in the Iri
holding company and subsidiaries of Eni.
Within the past year, Sace's management has been shaken up following the
involvement of senior executives in corruption scandals. In tandem the
organisation has moved to impose tougher risk criteria and expand its three
categories of country risk to five in line with other EU members.
Effective control has moved to the treasury. The politically-controlled
committee supervising its activity, Cipes, has been abolished as part of the
Ciampi government's reform of public administration.

FT  19 JAN 94 / World Trade News: Hopes for house kit imports
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Japan hopes to reduce its Dollars 60bn (Pounds 40bn) trade surplus with the
US by importing North American wooden house kits, Paul Abrahams reports. The
Japan External Trade Organisation (Jetro) is sending a 70-strong team to the
North American west coast to encourage manufacturers of ready-to-assemble
houses to try the Japanese market.
'The initiative's aim is not only to redress some of the trade surplus, but
also to improve the quality of life in Japan,' said Mr Shusaku Hirano,
Jetro's director of import promotion. North American wooden housing was
believed to last twice as long as Japanese equivalents, he said, and their
sound-proofing and insulation were said to be better.
American housing would have to be adapted to the Japanese market, however.
Besides instructions in Japanese, the kits required aluminium or steel
shielding to cover the wooden window frames. These cannot be exposed to the
elements under Japanese construction regulations.
Even if Japanese consumers take to American homes, it will be an uphill task
to cut the trade deficit. Of the 1.48m housing starts in Japan last year,
only about 50,000 used North American methods, and of these no more than
2,500 were imported, Jetro says.

FT  19 JAN 94 / World Trade News: US in drive over Tokyo copper tariffs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US copper producers still hope for the removal of tariff barriers that have
allowed Japan to build up one of the world's strongest copper smelting and
refining industries, even though it has no copper mines.
The issue is expected to be pressed in the next few weeks by US officials
who have expressed growing frustration over what they see as Japan's failure
to take action to close its trade surplus with the US. They feel there is an
opportunity to agree a bilateral deal during the run-up to the February 11
meeting in Washington between US President Bill Clinton and Mr Morihiro
Hosokawa, Japanese prime minister.
Japan's import tariffs, equivalent to about 8.5 per cent, and the 1 per cent
US duty were almost swept away during the recent General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade talks as progress was made towards zero duties on all
non-ferrous metals.
But negotiations on this issue ended in chaos and recriminations after the
European Union refused to cut its 6 per cent tariff on aluminium and Japan
withdrew its offer to remove copper duties.
The US non-ferrous metal producers committee, in recent talks with Mr Micky
Kantor, the US trade representative, claimed the Japanese duties injured the
world's more efficient producers. They seriously hindered imports of refined
copper to Japan and raised the copper price in Japan above world market
levels.
This gave Japanese copper producers a protected base from which to export
aggressively to third countries - and allowed Japanese smelters to offer
higher prices for copper scrap and copper concentrate (an intermediate
material) which are imported to Japan duty-free.
Japan dominates the world copper concentrate market, importing about
two-thirds of all the material traded internationally, said the US
organisation.
This dominant position also gave Japan a disproportionate influence in the
financing of new copper mines anywhere in the world because owners usually
needed a contract with a Japanese smelter before they could obtain finance.

FT  19 JAN 94 / Reagan and Bush 'knew of Iran-Contra plot'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
An independent investigation into the Iran-Contra conspiracy says former
President Ronald Reagan 'set the stage' for illegal activities but 'found no
credible evidence' that he violated any criminal statute.
Mr Lawrence Walsh, the special counsel appointed to examine the Iran-Contra
affair, said in his final report that Mr Reagan had 'knowingly participated
or at least acquiesced in' a cover-up after the conspiracy came to light.
Iran-Contra, the worst scandal of the Reagan presidency, was a plot led by
Colonel Oliver North, a member of the White House National Security Council
staff, to sell arms to Iran in an attempt to bring Iranian influence to bear
on the terrorist groups holding US hostages in Lebanon.
At the same time the scheme diverted money to the Contra rebels in Nicaragua
in defiance of a congressional ban on such aid.
Mr Walsh said former President George Bush, while he was Mr Reagan's
vice-president, was also fully aware of Iranian arms sales, 'contrary to his
public pronouncements', but again found no evidence that he broke any law.
The Iran-Contra investigation has been ridiculed by Republicans for its
Dollars 35m (Pounds 23.6m) cost, seven-year duration and meagre results.
Lawyers representing some of the main participants have criticised many
aspects of Mr Walsh's investigation, and had tried in vain to persuade the
appeals court which oversees the independent counsel to eliminate large
portions of his report.
In a statement yesterday, Mr Reagan called the report 'little more than a
self-administered pat on the back and a vehicle for baseless accusations
that (Mr Walsh) could never have proved in court'.
Although 11 of the Iran-Contra conspirators were convicted, the two most
significant convictions, of Colonel North and Admiral John Poindexter, his
superior at the White House, were overturned on the grounds that they had
earlier obtained immunity in exchange for testifying to Congress.
Others, including Mr Caspar Weinberger, former defence secretary, and Mr
Robert McFarlane, former national security adviser, were pardoned by Mr Bush
shortly before he left office last year. Only one Iran-Contra defendant
served any time in prison.
In a press conference yesterday Mr Walsh said many of those who took part in
the 1985-86 conspiracy had high motives, including Mr Reagan. 'He may have
been wilful but he thought he was serving his country in what he did,' Mr
Walsh said.
He was less forgiving of Mr Bush. 'I think President Bush will always have
to answer for his pardons. That was a most unjustifiable act,' Mr Walsh
said.
However, the report's impact might have been greater had Mr Bush won the
1992 election. As it is, the only conspirator still prominent in politics is
Mr North, who is seeking a seat in the Senate.
The report concludes that the sale of arms to Iran violated declared US
policy and may have violated the Arms Export Control Act, while the
provision of support for the Contras violated the Boland amendment banning
aid to military activities in Nicaragua.

FT  19 JAN 94 / Venezuela bank loss may reach Dollars 500m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Losses at Banco Latino, Venezuela's second largest commercial bank, which
was taken over by the government after closing its doors last week, may be
as much as Dollars 500m (Pounds 337.8m), according to Venezuelan bankers.
There was no official confirmation of the figure but it began to circulate
privately after monetary officials took their first, quick look at Latino's
books last weekend before deciding on full state intervention.
According to the bankers, it was the size of the apparent losses that
deterred other Venezuelan banks from stepping in to save the bank, which
reported assets of Dollars 1.9bn at the middle of last year.
Other disconcerting elements surfaced as the government began the task of
taking over the bank's management, deciding when to re-open and examining
the books. For one thing, the government's bank deposit guarantee fund has
33 per cent of its total resources, or Dollars 160m, on deposit at Banco
Latino itself. It is not clear if these funds can be used in the short term.
Moreover, bankers are worried that the freezing of Latino's resources could
cause serious problems at other Venezuelan banks, especially at two
financial institutions where Latino had large equity stakes and strong
business relationships.
Last week Banco Maracaibo, an important commercial bank, disclosed it had
purchased shares that Latino previously had held in the institution. Latino
reportedly had 38 per cent of Maracaibo's stock, but no details on the sale
were made public.
However, according to bankers, the international ramifications should be
modest: Latino has no public debt outstanding and bank credit lines to it
were said to be modest.
Government investigators are looking into Latino's offshore holdings, which
could amount to over Dollars 600m, according to one Venezuelan banker.
Bankers said the practice of dumping non-performing loans into offshore
subsidiaries has not been uncommon. Attention is concentrated on the bank's
Curacao subsidiary.
The bank also has a 51-per-cent-owned joint venture in the Netherlands
Antilles with ING Bank of the Netherlands - the Interunion Bank (Antilles),
a Miami-based US subsidiary and an office in Colombia.
A decision by the Venezuelan government to delay application of an unpopular
value added tax has split the cabinet and caused widespread confusion among
merchants and consumers.
The finance minister, Mr Carlos Rafael Silva, strongly opposed the decision
and offered his resignation on Monday but President Ramon Velasquez refused
to accept it.

FT  19 JAN 94 / Malaysia bemused at UK aid row: The events that led to a
boost for British exports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The furore in Britain over allegations that the Thatcher administration  -
and Mr John Major, the present prime minister - had agreed to large amounts
of aid for Malaysia in return for multi-million-dollar agreements to buy
British weaponry has been greeted with quiet bemusement in Kuala Lumpur.
When the allegations first surfaced late last year Mr Najib Tun Razak,
Malaysian defence minister, described them as 'baseless'. But officials in
Malaysia privately admit that a 1988 memorandum of understanding on defence
signed between the two countries was a catalyst for better relations.
In the early 1980s Dr Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysian prime minister, piqued at
what he perceived to be British high-handedness on issues ranging from trade
matters to higher fees for Malaysian students studying in Britain,
instituted a 'Buy British Last' policy.
But that has changed. In recent years British companies have won a
substantial share of business in Malaysia's fast growing economy. Not only
have British companies made an estimated Pounds 1.3bn of defence sales to
Malaysia under the memorandum: British officials calculate civil projects
have been worth substantially more than that amount for British companies.
When Mr Major visited Kuala Lumpur last September he announced that British
companies were negotiating contracts in Malaysia worth Dollars 1bn (Pounds
675m), which would secure 25,000 jobs in Britain.
The controversy centres on a UK government decision two years ago to sign a
Dollars 234m aid package for building a dam on the Pergau river, in the
north of Malaysia.
The decision was made against the advice of Britain's Overseas Development
Administration (ODA). There have been repeated allegations in Britain that
the aid package was directly linked to the defence memorandum - which could
be illegal under the 1966 Overseas Aid Act.
Earlier this week a ODA official told the House of Commons public accounts
committee Mr Major had taken the final decision on the aid deal.
Malaysian officials reject suggestions - first aired publicly in a report by
the British auditor general last October - that the Pergau project is
uneconomic and will result in Malaysian consumers having to pay more for
electricity.
Tenaga Nasional, partly privatised Malaysian electricity utility, has
repeatedly said Pergau is a sound project and there has never no suggestion
that, as a result of Pergau, electricity charges would rise.
Mr Samy Vellu, minister of energy, said from Malaysia's point of view, the
deal had been a good one. Last year's fall in the pound against the
Malaysian dollar had made the project cheaper. He told Malaysian MPs it did
not matter if others had lost - as long as Malaysia got the better deal.
But Pergau has, from the beginning, been a controversial project, with
Malaysian opposition MPs questioning the scale and cost of the project and
its environmental impact. The 600MW plant and dam at Pergau will cost an
estimated MDollars 1.8bn (Pounds 450m at current exchange rates).
There have also been questions about the process whereby Balfour Beatty, the
British civil engineering company, was awarded the bulk of the work at
Pergau. (Balfour Beatty is also a member of an Anglo-Japanese consortium
involved in work on a MDollars 8bn international airport being built outside
Kuala Lumpur.)
Work on Pergau is believed to be 60 per cent complete.

FT  19 JAN 94 / Nigeria hit by new currency regulations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ADAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LAGOS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Nigeria's official economy is near to standstill following currency rules in
last week's budget which fixed the naira exchange rate at 22 to the dollar
and banned sale of export proceeds at the parallel rate of about 45 to the
dollar, writes Paul Adams in Lagos.
Banks and industry are unable to deal in foreign exchange until the central
bank of Nigeria issues guidelines governing the rate and allocation of
foreign exchange.
The Central Bank of Nigeria yesterday postponed a meeting that was to have
defined the rules. No explanation was given but some senior officials doubt
that the bank is ready to regulate the system whereby it allocates scarce
foreign exchange at an overvalued rate to the commercial and merchant banks
with strict guidelines for their distribution to priority customers, mainly
manufacturing and agricultural companies.
The biggest casualty could be investment by multinational oil companies
which produce most of Nigeria's 1.8m barrels a day.
Oil accounted for nearly 90 per cent of last year's export earnings.
The oil majors bring in between Dollars 700m and Dollars 1bn a year for
existing operations. Before the budget, they exchanged dollars at the
parallel rate, about N45 to the dollar, but the N22 exchange rate has
doubled the funding cost of local operations. They are also suffering late
payment by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation for its 60 per cent
share of operating costs.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein is suing his former ambassador to Canada, who
defected to the UK in August, claiming Mr Hisham Al-Shawi wrongfully took
Iraqi funds from the embassy.
Writs were issued in the royal court of Jersey yesterday for recovery of
Pounds 280,000, plus damages and costs.
The writ named two other defendants, Mr Harith Sami Swadi and Mr Naif Khadem
Shnyien, and Midland Bank was cited as a party to the action.
The action arises from Mr Al-Shawi's decision at the time of his defection
to place cash held for operational expenses at the Ottawa embassy in a
Jersey trust fund until the Hussein regime was brought down.
Mr Al-Shawi said at the time that the funds were being expropriated 'to
ensure that they are not used to further sustain a regime that has treated
its people so vilely'.
Iraq claims that Mr Al-Shawi took CDollars 345,153 (Pounds 175,000) and
USDollars 155,950 (Pounds 105,000) from the embassy.
The writ claims that a lesser sum was transferred to a trust account in
Jersey.
Iraq is seeking to freeze the funds and and Mr Al-Shawi's own assets to the
value of Pounds 320,000, to cover costs.
The UK Home Office is considering his application for political asylum,
along with that of Mr Hamed Alwan Al-Jubouri, former ambassador to Tunisia.

FT  19 JAN 94 / Move on Israeli bank shares sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Avraham Shochat, Israel's minister of finance, said yesterday the
government would issue the tender for the sale of Bank Leumi, Israel's
second largest banking group, within a month.
Mr Shochat said a controlling stake, defined by the government as at least
20 per cent of the shares, would be sold to local or foreign investors in
Bank Leumi and, later in the year, in Bank Hapoalim, Israel's biggest bank.
The sale of ownership in Bank Hapoalim would depend on the speed of the sale
in Bank Leumi.
In 1992 Bank Leumi reported consolidated net profits of Dollars 76m (Pounds
51m) from total consolidated assets of Dollars 28bn.
For the same period Bank Hapoalim reported net profits of Dollars 90m from
assets of Dollars 36bn.
Last year the government began selling shares through the Tel Aviv stock
exchange in the banks, both of which were taken over by the government in
1983 after a share manipulation scandal.

<TEXT>
Syria expressed its disappointment yesterday at Israel's reaction to the
summit meeting on Sunday between President Hafez al-Assad and US President
Bill Clinton, and said it cast doubt on the Jewish state's willingness to
make peace.
After the meeting in Geneva, Mr Assad said Syria had made a strategic choice
to seek peace with Israel and was ready for a full normalisation of
relations with all its neighbours.
'We are surprised by the contradictory reactions in Israel,' Mr Farouq
al-Shara'a, Syria's foreign minister, said on arriving in Amman to brief
Crown Prince Hassan of Jordan on the outcome of the summit.
'We were expecting a big welcome to what was announced in the wake of the
summit between the two presidents,' he said.
'Instead of that we are hearing statements on a referendum and demands for
more. All of this makes us doubt the real intentions of the Israelis in
achieving a just peace.'
Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, yesterday confirmed his support
for an eventual referendum on peace with Syria in what was seen as an
attempt to put pressure on Damascus and win over domestic opposition ahead
of peace talks which are due to resume next week.
Israeli ministers, who are deeply divided on the issue, emphasised that a
choice on whether to call a referendum or hold national elections on
territorial concessions to Syria would only be considered once a peace
agreement had been finalised and initialled.
Political analysts said Mr Rabin, in raising the referendum possibility, was
more concerned with sending a message to Syria that Damascus would have to
be more flexible and conciliatory to win over a sceptical Israeli public.
Mr Rabin, they said, was also playing a domestic political gambit to
marginalise the opposition both inside and outside his Labour party,
encourage the Shas party to rejoin the weak coalition and calm the 13,000
Golan settlers to enable the government to negotiate without facing a
nationwide campaign against the peace talks.
Mr Rabin said: 'If and when we come to a draft of a peace treaty between
Syria - and it demands a painful price, perhaps beyond what the residents of
Israel expect - if, I emphasise if and when, in my opinion it will have to
be brought to a referendum.'
President Assad has consistently demanded an Israeli commitment to a full
withdrawal from the occupied Golan Heights, and he repeated this basic
objective during more than five hours of talks with Mr Clinton.
The Israeli proposal for a referendum was certain to be viewed with the
deepest suspicion in Damascus because it would mean that whatever deal was
ultimately negotiated could be subsequently overturned.
Under such a scheme, Mr Assad would be obliged to commit himself, without a
parallel guarantee from Israel.
Syrian officials have stressed that future negotiations with Israel, due to
resume next week in Washington, would be meaningless without an
understanding that Israel would acknowledge ultimate Syrian sovereignty over
the Golan.

FT  19 JAN 94 / Recession claims record failures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japanese corporate failures fell in number last year, but collapses
specifically linked to the recession hit a record high, said a leading
credit research agency.
Corporate failures provoked by falling sales, heavy debts or bad loans, rose
to a record 8,543 cases in 1993 or nearly 61 per cent of the year's total of
14,041 bankruptcies, according to Teikoku Databank. The overall total showed
a 0.9 per cent decline on 1992, the first drop for three years, an
indication that Japan might be near the bottom of its recession.
Among last year's most prominent collapses were Muramoto Construction, which
became the country's largest post-war corporate failure with debts of Y590bn
(Pounds 3.5bn); Nikkatsu, a film producer; and KYC Machine Industry, a maker
of construction equipment. Despite these high-profile collapses, the number
of failures with liabilities of more than Y100bn fell from 10 in 1992 to six
last year. Construction was worst hit sector with 2,868 failures, followed
by manufacturing industry with 2,591.
Another sign that the worst might be nearly over came with a 23 per cent
year-on-year rise in private sector orders of machinery in November,
reported by the government's Economic Planning Agency.
Machinery orders are a bell-weather of corporate capital spending in the six
to nine months ahead, but the November rise is only a partial recovery from
the record 31.1 per cent drop in the previous month. Further recovery in
December might indicate a real improvement, said the EPA. However,
industrial production continued to be sluggish this month, the EPA warned in
its latest survey yesterday.

FT  19 JAN 94 / Burmese junta to strengthen its power
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Demoralised Burmese opposition leaders said yesterday there was little they
could do to stop the military junta securing a new constitution that would
give the armed forces a dominant role in future governments, writes Victor
Mallet in Rangoon.
Burma's ruling generals, known collectively as the State Law and Order
Restoration Council (Slorc), moved a step closer to their goal of
constitutional power with the opening in Rangoon of the latest session of a
national convention to draft the constitution.
The Slorc - which jailed opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi more than four
years ago and ignored the results of the 1990 election won overwhelmingly by
her party, the National League for Democracy (NLD) - has already engineered
a series of 'constitutional objectives' which include a leading role for the
military.
Most of the outspoken NLD members who might have been delegates at the
convention have been imprisoned, exiled or disqualified; others have been
cowed into submission and silence by threats of jail and worse.
One NLD delegate, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation,
expressed concern that the armed forces were adopting tactics like those of
the military in Indonesia to entrench and legitimise their influence.
'There is no discussion here,' he said in the convention hall. 'It goes
according to their (the armed forces') will. They say it's settled.'
Asked why the emasculated NLD bothered to continue, the official replied:
'What alternative is there? We have to keep our political platform. If we
fail to attend this, most probably they will disband our party.'
He acknowledged, however, that the remnants of the NLD could achieve 'more
or less nothing'.
Burma's armed forces appear to be in a stronger position than they have
enjoyed for several years.
Ethnic rebel groups along the borders have agreed to negotiate ceasefires
after decades of fighting, and the economy, with the help of Thai,
Singaporean and other investors, has started to recover after a long period
of stagnation and decline.

FT  19 JAN 94 / Prosecutors step up action against bribery
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Public prosecutors yesterday stepped up their purge against political
bribery in the construction industry by arresting two senior executives of
Obayashi, Japan's fourth largest contractor.
The arrests coincide with the publication of government plans to reduce
barriers to foreign competition in the construction market, including the
much-criticised practice of bid-rigging.
The two men arrested are Mr Koreaki Hagiwara, a vice-president of Obayashi
and Mr Juichi Konishi, in charge of a branch office in the northern city of
Sendai.
They are suspected of paying a former Sendai mayor, Mr Toru Ishii, Y10m
(Pounds 60,000) to get a contract for a waste incineration plant.
The cash was channelled in late 1992 to the local branch of the then ruling
Liberal Democratic party, prosecutors believe.
Mr Ishii has admitted receiving cash from four other construction companies.
Obayashi is the seventh leading contractor to be drawn into the widening net
of the inquiry.
It has become the biggest corruption scandal since the second world war,
with the arrest of more than 30 people, including two regional governors and
two city mayors.
The construction industry is believed to have been a prime source of illicit
funds for leading political parties, public distaste for which contributed
to the LDP's election defeat last July after 38 years in power.
The new coalition government is attempting this week to overcome LDP
opposition to get parliamentary agreement on proposals to curb political
funding and redraw the electoral system. Yet the Tokyo prosecutor's office,
which initiated this investigation, has so far stopped short of arresting a
national politician or bureaucrat.
There is mounting speculation, however, that the office might soon hit a
national target since the appointment late last year of the celebrated
investigator, Mr Yusuke Yoshinaga, as prosecutor-general.
The government's appointment of Mr Yoshinaga, a leading figure in exposing
the Lockheed bribery scandals of the 1970s, is seen as an attempt to beef up
the inquiry, which had appeared to be losing impetus.
A former prime minister and two former cabinet ministers, on both sides of
the house, are under suspicion, according to political commentators and
lawyers in Tokyo.

FT  19 JAN 94 / Japan adopts public works bidding plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Japanese government yesterday adopted a long-awaited programme to
increase the transparency of the country's bidding system for public works
projects and improve access to the market for foreign contractors.
The move, which is expected to help avert sanctions by the US against Japan
for its failure to open its public works market to foreign companies, comes
just two days before a US deadline for a decision on whether to impose
sanctions against Japan.
Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, Japanese prime minister, hailed the measure as
introducing an 'historic' change in Japan's public sector works. Mr Tsutomu
Hata, foreign minister, called on his fellow ministers to support the
implementation of the measures which he said were 'internationally
appropriate' and in line with the agreement reached in the Uruguay Round of
trade talks.
Despite official enthusiasm, the plan is widely regarded in Japan as
insufficient to change the close relationships between Japanese construction
companies and public sector institutions and the collusive and exclusive
business practices that characterise the country's construction market.
It is unclear whether the programme will be seen as adequate in Washington.
A US trade official said yesterday that the plan was being reviewed by an
inter-agency committee which will make its views known tomorrow, the
sanctions deadline.
The plan, to be implemented in April, calls for the adoption of an open and
competitive bidding system for public works projects sponsored by the
central government and public corporations which are valued at SDR4.5m
(special drawing rights) - Pounds 41.53m - and for those sponsored by
prefectures and specified cities which are valued at more than SDR15m.
For design and consulting services, the area of most interest to foreign
firms, the thresholds above which an open bidding system will be the rule
are SDR450,000 for central government projects and SDR1.5m for prefectural
governments.
More transparent guidelines on public tendering are to be drawn up by
Japan's Fair Trade Commission and the experience of foreign companies
outside Japan will be taken into account in evaluating the eligibility of
foreign companies to bid for projects.
Under Japan's present system, only companies which have been designated by
the projects' sponsors are eligible to bid for a contract.
Penalties against unfair practices will also be strengthened in response to
criticism that past penalties have been too weak. Japan and the US will
continue to assess progress by foreign companies in winning public works
contracts.
The plan opens a substantial proportion of Japanese public works projects to
open bidding.
Widespread implementation of the new measures will depend to a large extent
on the size of the penalties against illicit practices which will be decided
later this year.

FT  19 JAN 94 / South Korean groups target core businesses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
South Korea's 30 largest conglomerates, or chaebol, yesterday completed the
selection of their main business sectors as part of a government policy to
reduce the size of the sprawling business groups.
The core industries selected will receive funding benefits under the
country's tightly-regulated financial system. They include relaxation of
credit controls, and priority government approval for issuing bonds abroad
and raising capital on the domestic stock market.
The government will also provide research and development support to
high-tech companies and ease restrictions on land purchases.
It is the latest of several so far unsuccessful government attempts to
persuade the chaebol to streamline their operations and specialise in a few
industries.
Officials have long argued that the chaebol have diversified into too many
unrelated industries, which is harming their efficiency and global
competitiveness.
They have for example, spent capital on expanding their industrial empires
in intense competition with one another rather than on developing products
through higher research spending.
The expansion of the chaebol was fed by cheap government loans as the
country rapidly industrialised in the past three decades, although the state
has tried to reduce financing in recent years.
The 10 largest chaebol, including Hyundai, Samsung, Lucky-Goldstar and
Daewoo, were asked by the government to select three core industrial sectors
and the next 20 were ordered to pick two sectors to develop. Non-core
industrial sectors will be subject to strict credit restrictions.
The plan bears some similarity to the last chaebol policy, introduced in
1991, which stipulated that the 30 leading conglomerates had to select three
core industries, which would then receive unrestricted bank loans. But that
programme failed to reduce the size of the chaebol or fulfil the
government's hope that they would select their most advanced industries.
Instead, the designated core companies were often those needing the most
capital investments, such as the troubled petrochemical industry, or ones
with the heaviest debts.
The government this time tried to correct some of those problems by
proposing that core companies must meet certain conditions to qualify.
Selected companies, for example, must already account for at least 10 per
cent of group sales, which would indicate that they are already competitive.
But the new list of core companies still bears a strong resemblance to the
ones picked three years ago.
Chemical companies emerged as the largest group of core companies, with 22
being selected, including 13 in the petrochemical area.
Other favoured industries included food and beverage (11), motor vehicles
(9), energy (9), machinery (6), electronics (6), steel (6) and non-metal
minerals (5).
In the service sector, 24 companies engaged in trade, distribution and
transportation industries were selected; 12 more were in construction.
The government may have difficulty in preventing the business groups from
using the core companies to funnel funds they obtain to non-core industries,
a problem that afflicted the previous policy

FT  19 JAN 94 / Russians to stay in Baltics, says Kozyrev
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, indicated yesterday that
Russian troops would stay in the Baltics in spite of commitments, repeated
at the US-Russian summit last week, to withdraw them as soon as possible.
Mr Kozyrev told a conference on Russian policy towards the countries of the
Commonwealth of Independent States and the Baltic states that complete
withdrawal of troops 'from this region' would be against Russia's interests
 -because it would create a security vacuum and because it would leave
ethnic Russians undefended. Both Tass and Interfax news agencies indicated
that Mr Kozyrev had included the Baltic countries in his remarks on the
troop pull-out.
'We should not withdraw from these regions which have been in the sphere of
Russian interests for centuries and we should not fear these words,' Tass
quoted him as saying.
In Washington, a State Department spokesman said clarification might be
sought as the remarks were at odds with statements by President Boris
Yeltsin during President Bill Clinton's recent visit to Moscow.
The remarks, if confirmed as applying to the Baltic states of Estonia and
Latvia (Russian troops have already left Lithuania), will stir alarm in
those countries. They have long warned that Russian commitments to pull out
troops were hostage to political shifts in Moscow. The remarks are
surprising from a liberal minister like Mr Kozyrev.
In identifying the protection of ethnic Russians in the former Soviet states
as 'one of Moscow's main strategic interests', he is stealing some of the
rhetoric of Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky's Liberal Democratic party and
delivering a pointed warning to Estonia and Latvia, where citizenship laws
have withheld voting rights from non-ethnic Balts until language and other
criteria are met.
Russia has military bases in all former Soviet states except Lithuania and
Azerbaijan. Areas of tension apart from the Baltics include Moldova, where
the 14th Army under General Lebed guards the Russian-speaking population in
the Trans Dnestr region, and Ukraine, where ownership of the Black Sea fleet
in its Crimean bases is in contention between Russia and Ukraine - a
contention which would be increased by the election of a president of Crimea
who favours union with Russia, as now seems likely.

FT  19 JAN 94 / Hurd will visit Bosnia as decision nears on presence of
British troops
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Douglas Hurd, Britain's foreign secretary, confirmed yesterday that he
would visit Bosnia on Friday to assess the situation of the British troops
serving with the UN protection force.
The visit appears to be smoothing the way for a possible decision on a
withdrawal of the troops, just five weeks ahead of an informal deadline set
by Mr Hurd for such a decision.
British officials yesterday stressed that the fact-finding visit, which has
replaced a visit to Greece, had come at Mr Hurd's own initiative and had
only been surrounded by secrecy for security reasons.
The officials denied that a decision had already been taken about the
troops, and stressed that a withdrawal would depend on the current peace
talks in Geneva.
However, pessimism about the prospects for peace prevailed in Geneva after a
day of bilateral talks among the heads of the three warring communities and
separate meetings with Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, the
international mediators.
Without concealing their contempt for their Moslem adversaries, Serb leaders
last night said they were close to cementing an alliance with their Croat
counterparts. Such a union would amount to a Serb-Croat carve-up of Bosnia,
leaving the Moslems without a homeland.
They also indicated that they would renege on their promise to surrender
land if Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic failed to endorse an agreement
on the republic's partition.
Mr Radovan Karadzic, Bosnian Serb leader, accused his Moslem foes of wanting
'more war' by posing new demands. In closed-door meetings, the Serbian
delegation raised the stakes by threatening to proclaim as permanent the
current borders of their self-styled state, which, after 22 months of war,
comprises 70 per cent of Bosnia.
In a scathing indictment, Mr Haris Silajdzic, the Bosnian prime minister,
described the partition talks as 'futile', accusing the international
community of 'supporting fascist aggression' on Bosnia at the expense of a
'multicultural, multi-ethnic state'
The toughened stance, suggesting that they do not take seriously the threats
of Nato air strikes against Serbian targets, was agreed at a session of the
Serbian 'parliament' on Monday in Bosnia.
UN officials said yesterday that Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN
secretary-general, had asked Mr Yasushi Akashi, his special envoy in former
Yugoslavia, to draft concrete plans to open up the airport in Tuzla, the
biggest Bosnian stronghold, in an effort to renew pressure on the Bosnian
Serbs.
Mr Akashi also said yesterday he had not ruled out the use of air power, as
threatened last week at the Nato summit. But a diplomat admitted air strikes
were not 'high on the agenda at this time'.

FT  19 JAN 94 / Bonn unveils its plan to open up labour market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Germany's government yesterday unveiled far-reaching measures intended to
deregulate the labour market, promote new businesses and stem rising
unemployment.
Key measures include the legalisation of private employment agencies to end
the state monopoly on job placing, special inducements for long-term
unemployed to take seasonal jobs or low-paid work in the community, and
moves to promote more part-time work in both state and private sectors.
At the same time, the government plans to cut the wages paid to workers on
so-called job creation schemes, where thousands who would otherwise have
been unemployed (especially in east Germany) have been kept in their
factories with state subsidies. In future they will only get 80 per cent of
their former wages.
The plan was instantly attacked by the opposition Social Democratic party as
a dangerous initiative to create different classes of labour: the qualified,
unqualified, and the long-term unemployed.
Only on promoting more part-time working do both sides of the political
establishment apparently agree.
The programme was approved yesterday by leaders of the three partners in
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government, along with a new package of budget
cuts, totalling DM5bn (Pounds 1.9bn), intended to keep the 1994 government
deficit below DM70bn.
Key measures in the 30-point programme, drawn up by the Economics Ministry,
include better start-up incentives for small-time entrepreneurs, among them
low-interest rate loans from the state's Bank for Reconstruction.
There will also be special measures to encourage the unemployed to set
themselves up as self-employed, guaranteeing them a transitional period of
six months' unemployment benefit while they do so.
Similar incentives will be introduced to encourage the long-term unemployed
to take seasonal jobs, by allowing them to keep part of their unemployment
benefit, or to take jobs serving their local communities.
The thinking behind the government proposal is to create greater flexibility
and mobility in finding jobs for workers. However trade unions and the SPD
are bitterly opposed, on the grounds that private agencies will cream off
the best jobs and workers, leaving the rest to compete in a second-class
state-run labour market.
The government plan also aims to clamp down on illegal employers of cheap
foreign workers, above all in the construction industry. Fines will be
introduced for principal contractors who allow their sub-contractors to
employ such workers, and the employers themselves will be banned from
tendering for future public sector contracts.

FT  19 JAN 94 / Brussels discord on drug price controls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Martin Bangemann, European Union industry commissioner, is coming under
increasing pressure from Commission colleagues to tone down a long-awaited
report calling for the phasing out of direct price controls on
pharmaceuticals.
In its draft report on the industry, the Commission's industry directorate
suggests that EU governments should do away with such controls, and look for
alternative ways of limiting health expenditure.
But some other commissioners - notably Mr Padraig Flynn, health commissioner
 -have asked for further internal discussions on the issue.
The report, now unlikely to be tabled until the end of next month, would not
tie the hands of governments, but opponents believe it could be used as a
weapon by an industry fighting to escape controls.
It concludes that price controls have hampered innovation, and thus the
long-term growth of the industry. In recent months, big drug companies have
dismissed European governments' efforts to curb drugs bills as ineffective
and counter-productive.
In November, the president of Elf-Sanofi, France's second largest drugs
group, warned that drug prices in France had been too low for too long. He
urged the government to pay higher prices for innovative products, offset by
lower prices for older drugs.

FT  19 JAN 94 / EU takes Italy to court over stock exchange rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission has finally lost patience with the Italian
government and opened a European Court case against Rome, for failing to
change discriminatory stock exchange rules.
Last June, Brussels promised to take action in the European Court of Justice
if the rules - which force foreign stockbrokers to set up special offices in
Italy - were not changed by January 15.
The Commission confirmed yesterday that the rules had not been changed and
that a complaint had been lodged with the Court in Luxembourg - three years
after the Commission's first letter of complaint to the Italian government.
The final decision was taken by one of Italy's two commissioners in
Brussels, Mr Raniero Vanni d'Archirafi, who is responsible for financial
services. 'He was convinced we had to do it,' said a spokeswoman.
Italian officials said yesterday the government had promised to push through
a parliamentary decision on the so-called SIMs law - named after the Societa
di Intermediazione Mobiliare, the new type of securities house it created -
by the end of June. 'Now the Commission has introduced this letter (to the
court), we shall wait and see what the court decides. We don't consider
ourselves any longer bound by our commitment (of June 30),' said a
Brussels-based diplomat.
The official explained that changes to the SIMs law had been tabled as part
of legislation aimed at translating European directives and rulings into
Italian law. But a vote on the draft legislation had been held up by
pre-election turmoil in the parliament. He added that Rome had objected on
principle to the Commission's attempt to put pressure on national
parliamentary procedure.
The UK government formally complained to Brussels about the SIMs law in
September 1991, arguing that it was an unacceptable barrier to freedom of
establishment and free provision of services in the union. The rules cover
equity trading on the domestic market and sale of securities of any type to
Italian investors other than SIMs or banks.
Italy's failure to change the rules may come as a surprise as most opponents
of the SIMs law had begun to detect a change of heart in Rome, following the
adoption of directives liberalising securities trading last year.

FT  19 JAN 94 / Bundesbank firm on interest rate policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The German Bundesbank yesterday rejected calls for a more aggressive policy
of interest rate cuts to promote economic recovery, insisting that its money
supply target for 1994 would leave ample room for growth.
The central bank also ruled out any early move to a European Union-wide
system of monetary targeting as both premature and unjustified.
In its latest monthly report, the Bundesbank spelt out in detail the
reasoning behind its new target 'corridor' for money supply, which sets the
growth of the broad M3 measure of money supply at 4-6 per cent this year,
compared with 4.5-6.5 per cent in 1993.
As usual, the report was scrupulously careful not to give any indication of
the bank's likely decision on interest rates at its next fortnightly
meeting, which takes place in Frankfurt tomorrow.
'The Bundesbank will continue to explore carefully its room for manoeuvre in
interest rate policy, resulting from the development of money supply and the
whole economic environment,' it said.
It flatly rejected both 'a forced policy of interest rate cuts to revive the
economy' and 'any attempt to solve the German economy's problems through a
devaluation of the D-Mark, caused by interest rate cuts'.
The bank's analysis concludes that the extraordinary factors which caused
money supply to grow well outside its target corridor for the past two years
have now been largely left behind. Thus the chances of keeping within the
1994 guidelines are much improved.
Those special factors included the effects of German unification, the
large-scale interventions by European central banks on the currency markets,
the inverse interest rate structure with long-term rates below short-term,
and the introduction of a German withholding tax on investment income.
'The long-term relationship between money supply and the movement of prices
still exists in Germany, in spite of the problems of unification,' it said.
The M3 measure of money supply, including short-term deposits and savings
accounts as well as current accounts and cash in circulation, remained the
best guide for a policy of monetary stability, rather than the alternative
of interest rates and the interest rate structure.
The tighter money supply target for 1994 should not be seen as a signal for
a more restrictive monetary policy, the report said. It reflected rather a
lower forecast for the growth of the production potential of the German
economy this year - down from 3 per cent in 1993 to 2.5 per cent.
The target is also based on a 'price norm' of 2 per cent inflation,
underlining the bank's determination to maintain its medium-term measure for
monetary stability. Inflation in east Germany, which has reflected a series
of 'administered' price increases in housing rents and other charges, would
come much closer to west German inflation this year, it said.
On the question of a EU-wide money supply target, coinciding with the start
of phase two of European economic and monetary union on January 1, the bank
said it would 'lack any firm foundation.'

FT  19 JAN 94 / Italy's DC party becomes Popular
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Italy's Christian Democrats (DCs) yesterday transformed themselves into the
Popular party, in an effort to distance the party from the discredit of
years of corrupt rule under successive Christian Democrat governments.
The bulk of the party followed Mr Mino Martinazzoli, the outgoing Christian
Democrat leader, in forming the new political group. However, a small
minority decided against the move and set up on their own, calling
themselves the Centre Christian Democrats, in a split related more to
personalities than to ideology.
The break-up of the Christian Democratic party, which was founded in 1942,
underlines the problems faced by politicians seeking to mould disparate
forces of the centre into credible alliances to fight the general elections
on March 27.
Matters are likely to be complicated further if Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the
media magnate, decides to enter the fray.
He is reported to be close to announcing his decision to stand as a
parliamentary candidate either in Milan or Rome, backed by the series of
political clubs he has founded up and down the country.
The clubs are called Forza Italia - literally 'Go on Italy', the exhortation
used by football crowds and based on his Milan team's supporters' club.
The fact that he has held back from a decision for so long indicates that he
is under pressure from both the business community and the political
establishment to refrain from direct involvement.
Yesterday, the Ciampi government bowed to a rising tide of protest about the
election day coinciding with the Jewish Passover. As a concession the
government is now expected to reintroduce, on an exceptional basis, voting
over two days.
One-day voting was part of last August's electoral reform.

FT  19 JAN 94 / Switzerland catches no chill being out in the cold: The
benefits of staying outside the EEA have outweighed the disadvantages so
far,
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
one looking at the maps of western Europe published to mark the creation of
the European Economic Area on January 1 cannot help but notice an anomaly.
There it is - Switzerland - smack in the middle of western Europe, but the
only country in the region not to have joined the world's largest free trade
area.
A year ago, most economic pundits, both inside and outside the country,
warned that the arrogant Swiss would pay heavily for their rejection of EEA
membership in a December 1992 referendum.
Today, the Swiss appear to be having the last laugh. The country's role as a
financial haven has enjoyed a new lease on life in the past year and any
trade disadvantages arising from remaining outside the EEA may well be
offset by benefits from the Uruguay Round multilateral trade accord and the
planned introduction of value added tax.
Switzerland has avoided having to pay Ecu174m (Pounds 137m) to the European
Union's cohesion fund, its share of the donation the countries in the
European Free Trade Association agreed to make as a condition of forming the
EEA.
Moreover, current negative trends, such as low investment, rising
unemployment and weak exports, can be attributed to factors unrelated to EEA
membership, such as increasing competition from eastern European countries
or the depressed state of key export markets, especially Germany.
'I am not unhappy with the situation at all,' says Mr Hans Kaufmann, chief
economist at Bank Julius Baer in Zurich. Other economists acknowledge that
Switzerland has not suffered much yet, but believe the country faces a tough
future. Some 60 per cent of its exports are sent into the EEA.
'There are already signs of passive discrimination against Swiss exports to
EEA countries,' says Mr Alois Bischofberger, chief economist of Credit
Suisse, 'and it is becoming more difficult for Swiss to get work permits in
Germany.'
Mr Christophe Kollreuter, head of the Basle Business Cycle Research Group
(BAK), fears that when business investment recovers, Switzerland will fare
much worse than member countries. He believes Swiss manufacturers will
prefer to put their new plants inside the EEA.
Mr Kaufmann, however, argues that EEA-based companies may want to set up
offices in convenient, independent Switzerland so their international
activities are beyond EEA jurisdiction.
Certainly some international investors were relieved that the long arm of
Brussels would not soon be reaching into their Swiss bank accounts. It is
hard to assess the extent to which the EEA rejection influenced the huge
flow of foreign funds into safe-haven Swiss banks last year. The main causes
seem to have been the turbulence in the European monetary system, tax
increases in Germany and political tensions in Italy. But, whatever the
cause, the inflow allowed Swiss interest rates to fall more quickly than
those in Germany, helping to ease recessionary forces in the country.
Mr Kaufmann says that even if Switzerland's independence accounted for only
a tenth of the foreign private capital placed in the country, that would be
enough to add some SFr700m (Pounds 322m) of value to the economy: 'It would
not be easy to make that up elsewhere.'
The costs of new barriers to exporting to the EEA could also be largely
offset by the introduction of value added tax next year. VAT will replace a
turnover tax that has penalised exporters; Mr Kaufmann estimates it will add
1-2 per cent to manufacturers' export margins.
One fear arising from the EEA rejection was that the European Union would
refuse to negotiate bilateral trade deals with Switzerland. But last month,
the two concluded an agreement on rules of origin, giving Switzerland about
90 per cent of the advantages of EEA membership in the area of customs and
tariffs.
This agreement proves to some extent the argument of anti-EEA Swiss that the
Union has no interest in making life difficult for its second largest
trading partner. But Swiss trade officials point out that this was a case
that enabled both sides to avoid immense amounts of red tape.
They expect things will not be so easy over issues where Switzerland is the
supplicant, as in seeking equal rights for Swissair in EEA open skies.
Such potential problems, however, are not enough to create a sense of
urgency about reversing last year's momentous decision; opinion polls
indicate that a small majority would still vote to stay out.
In a recent foreign policy white paper, the government foresaw no new
initiatives in the near future. At the least, it would wait for referendums
on joining the EU expected in the next year or so in Austria, Sweden,
Finland and Norway. Depending on their outcomes, Switzerland might want to
try again to join the EEA or might apply directly for European Union
membership.

Most industries in Switzerland expect sales and production to rise this year
for the first time in three years, but margins will continue to be squeezed,
according to a recent survey of 2,300 companies by Union Bank of
Switzerland. Capital spending this year should stabilise at last year's
level, UBS said. 'All in all there are clear signs of an economic
turnaround. But a strong recovery is not yet in sight,' it concluded.

FT  19 JAN 94 / UK retailers hit by Pounds 2bn cost of crime last year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Crime cost UK retailers Pounds 2bn last year and knocked about a quarter off
their profits, according to the first comprehensive survey of the problem,
published yesterday.
The British Retail Consortium said retailers lost Pounds 560m through
recorded crimes in the financial year 1992-93, based on a survey of 54,000
shops accounting for almost half of all UK retail sales. The figures do not
include police, court and other costs.
Retailers also lost Pounds 1bn of goods through unrecorded crimes, and spent
Pounds 370m on anti-crime measures. Shops apprehended 1.2m customers in
connection with crimes - of whom more than 700,000 were referred to the
police - and some 28,000 of their own staff.
'External' crime, including customer theft, burglary, arson and robbery,
comprised 54 per cent of the total cost, while 'internal' crime such as
staff theft accounted for 27 per cent. Crime prevention accounted for 19 per
cent.
The problem of retail crime was highlighted last year by Mr Stanley Kalms,
chairman of Dixons, who said shops were having to adopt 'vigilante' tactics.
Mr Keith Ackroyd, chairman of the consortium, said the problem was growing.
'Crime is one of the most serious and costly problems faced by the industry,
in terms of direct losses of product, of the cost of preventative measures
and in the increase of violence and injury to staff,' he said.
'Ultimately it is the consumer and society at large that bears these costs.'
The BRC will use the data to develop a programme to counter crime.

FT  19 JAN 94 / Russian economy worsens as rouble drops by 7.3%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The frail Russian economy tottered yesterday as its currency plunged 7.3 per
cent, inflation turned upward and a struggle over the membership and the
policies of the new government intensified.
On Moscow's interbank currency exchange the rouble, which has slid 25 per
cent this month, traded at Rbs1,504 to the dollar, down Rbs102 from Monday.
On the streets, the US currency was changing hands at up to Rbs1,700 as
queues formed at exchange offices.
The inflation rate reached 12 per cent for the first two weeks of January
alone, it emerged. It is on course for more than 20 per cent for the whole
of this month after a much trumpeted fall to a monthly 12 per cent in
December.
Mr Boris Fyodorov, the most prominent liberal cabinet member whose fate is
still unknown, refused the finance minister post after it was offered to him
without his present rank of deputy premier. He sent a stinging letter to
President Boris Yeltsin accusing prime minister Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin's
government of 'sliding into communism' and refusing to 'act as a veil for
its policies'. He repeated that he would not serve while Mr Viktor
Gerashchenko remained chairman of the central bank or if Mr Alexander
Zaveryukha, a deputy premier and member of the pro-communist Agrarian party,
was confirmed in his post. He also demanded guarantees that reform would
continue.
Unconfirmed reports on the radio station Ekho Moskvy said that Mr Yeltsin -
who was locked for most of the day in a meeting with Mr Chernomyrdin
described by his press secretary as 'not easy' - had proposed replacing Mr
Gerashchenko. This would presumably allow Mr Fyodorov to remain in
government, possibly as first deputy prime minister - the post vacated by Mr
Yegor Gaidar, the leading economic reformer who resigned at the weekend.
Mr Alexander Shokhin, an original member of the radical Gaidar team who now
takes a moderate stance, told reporters yesterday at the State Duma, the
lower house of parliament, that he had been offered the post of economics
minister or of minister for the Commonwealth of Independent States. He was
considering the offers.
Mutual recriminations are now flying among the leading members of the
Russia's Choice party, headed by Mr Gaidar, following the defection from it
of Mr Fyodorov and Mr Andrei Makarov to the Union of December 12. This was
formed after the parliamentary election by liberal independent deputies
headed by Mrs Irina Khakamada. Mr Sergei Yushenkov, a senior member of
Russia's Choice, said that Mr Fyodorov's move 'raised ethical questions'
since he was elected on the Russia's Choice ticket.
From the other side of the political spectrum Mr Sergei Baburin, a leading
nationalist deputy, said that 'Gaidar's departure will complete the
transition of Russia's Choice from government to opposition'.

FT  19 JAN 94 / Setback for Clinton over new defence secretary: Inman
withdraws as nominee citing 'partisan' attack by Dole
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Another key appointment by US president Bill Clinton crashed dramatically
yesterday when Mr Bobby Ray Inman, the former admiral he picked to take over
as defence secretary, withdrew as nominee.
Mr Inman, a former intelligence officer, said he could not stand the
'distortions of my record, my character and my reputation' involved in
winning confirmation from the Senate. He blamed Senator Robert Dole, the
leader of the opposition Republicans in the Senate, who he claimed had
'directed a partisan response to my nomination'.
The withdrawal is a crushing blow for Mr Clinton, who had hoped to improve
his administration's decision-making structure when replacing Mr Les Aspin,
the intellectual former congressman who is due to step down as defence
secretary tomorrow.
Now Mr Clinton must not only start again to search for a defence secretary,
but will also face questions about his judgment in picking an apparently
thin-skinned and self-centred man for the Pentagon.
Mr Clinton has had many setbacks with his appointments, the most damaging
being the Nannygate controversy over Ms Zoe Baird, his choice for
attorney-general, who had employed an illegal immigrant as a nanny and
failed to pay appropriate taxes.
In an extraordinary press conference yesterday in his home town of Austin,
Texas, Mr Inman claimed he had heard of a deal between Mr Dole and Mr
William Safire, the New York Times columnist, for Mr Dole to mount an attack
on Mr Inman. Mr Safire would return the favour by focusing on the Whitewater
financial imbroglio surrounding the Clintons, for which the president last
week requested the appointment of an independent counsel.
'Whether it's true or not, I believed it was true on the 6th (of January)
and that's the day I made up my mind that I don't need this,' Mr Inman said,
adding that he had delayed his decision because of the death of Mr Clinton's
mother and the president's subsequent trip to the Nato summit and Moscow.
Mr Dole yesterday denied that he had planned to lead any concerted
opposition to Mr Inman's confirmation. 'I have no idea what's gotten into
Bobby Inman, or what partisan response to his nomination he is talking
about,' he said in a statement issued yesterday afternoon.
Mr Inman also delivered a long justification of his financial relationship
with his housekeeper, on whose pay he had not made the required social
security and tax payments. He had already raised eyebrows with his
performance at the White House ceremony to announce his nomination. There,
he announced that he had voted for then President George Bush in the 1992
election, and gave the impression that he had interviewed Mr Clinton for the
job rather than vice versa.
Senator John McCain, a Republican member of the armed services committee who
would have conducted Mr Inman's confirmation hearings, said all his
Republican colleagues on the committee had supported the nomination. He
rejected Mr Inman's theory of a plan by Senator Dole. Many potential
government officials have complained about the rigours of the confirmation
process, but most of those unwilling to undergo such gruelling hearings do
not accept nomination.

FT  19 JAN 94 / Viacom raises bid for Paramount
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Viacom, the cable television company, yesterday kept alive its hopes of
winning the Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.7bn) takeover battle for film group
Paramount Communications by slightly raising the cash in its bid and
significantly improving the package of securities offered to shareholders.
Analysts said Viacom appeared to have raised its offer to roughly the same
level as rival bidder QVC Network, paving the way for a further burst of
bidding later in the month, before the February 1 deadline set by Paramount
for final offers.
The new terms came four days before the close of the current tender offers
from the two bidders. If Viacom had not raised its bid it would have risked
QVC gaining over 50 per cent of Paramount's shares in the tender offer as
until yesterday morning analysts valued QVC's bid at Dollars 10.1bn and
Viacom's at Dollars 9.3bn.
Viacom claimed its new bid was worth Dollars 10.5bn and said the offer was
'at the highest level that it believes would be in the interests' of its
shareholders and those of Paramount or Blockbuster Entertainment.
Blockbuster agreed earlier this month to merge with Viacom.
Analysts valued it at anywhere from Dollars 10bn to Dollars 10.3bn, or
Dollars 82 to Dollars 87 a share, compared with a QVC offer worth Dollars 84
to Dollars 85 a share. 'This clearly makes the Viacom bid competitive with
QVC, if not downright better,' said Mr Frederick Moran of Salomon Brothers.
The board of Paramount, which has been recommending QVC's bid to
shareholders, said it would meet this week to consider the new offer. Viacom
has increased from Dollars 105 a share to Dollars 107 the amount it is
offering for 50.1 per cent of Paramount's stock. That compares with Dollars
92 a share from QVC.
It also improved the package of securities on offer for the remaining 49.9
per cent. The main elements of the offer are unchanged: 0.93065 of a share
of Viacom's non-voting class B stock, which has fallen sharply in market
value during the bid and closed yesterday at Dollars 37 3/4 , down Dollars 1
3/8 , and 0.30408 of a share of preferred stock for each Paramount share.
However, Viacom has added warrants to buy its shares to the package and also
placed a floor of Dollars 48 a share under its B shares by offering
Paramount stockholders so-called contingent value rights. These would give
investors the right to receive, on the first anniversary of a
Paramount-Viacom merger, the amount of cash - up to Dollars 10 a share - by
which the B shares traded below Dollars 48.

FT  19 JAN 94 / Major says Labour to blame for 'smear and innuendo'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Westminster was mired in smear and counter-smear last night after Mr John
Major accused Labour of conducting a campaign of innuendo against the
government and Lord Justice Scott demanded clarification of the prime
minister's evidence to the arms for Iraq inquiry.
A day after giving his evidence, Mr Major sought to build on a positive
Conservative response to his performance by going on the offensive for the
first time in several weeks.
The prime minister told the Commons at question time that Labour MPs were
spreading 'smear and innuendo on a week to week basis with a complete
disregard for the truth'.
Downing Street said Mr Major had responded spontaneously to attacks on the
government's integrity and the credibility of his back to basics campaign.
But a senior Conservative official quickly released a list of seven alleged
Labour smears, suggesting Mr Major's response was an attempt to draw Labour
into the debate on the government's moral standing.
Mr John Smith, Labour leader, dismissed the prime minister's claims as a
'pathetic' response to opposition attacks on the 'hypocrisy and deceit' of
the government's taxation policies.
In the Commons, Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, attacked
the moral standing of Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary to the
treasury, for 'undermining the institutions' of postwar Britain.
Mr Frank Dobson, Labour's transport spokesman, renewed allegations about the
relationship between Mr Gerry Malone, the Tory party's deputy chairman, and
Mr Asil Nadir, fugitive head of the collapsed Polly Peck.
In a letter to Mr Major, Lord Justice Scott asked him to name a civil
servant who deleted a reference to a 'minor modification' in government arms
sales guidelines in a briefing note submitted to the prime minister.
The document in which the deletion occurs could prove significant if the
inquiry establishes it involved an attempt to mislead parliament or
contradicted Mr Major's statement that he played no part in forming or
amending the guidelines.
Mr Major suggested on Monday that the alteration may have been made by
someone who was unaware that the guidelines had been changed. This was
dismissed by the judge as a 'pretty improbable speculation'. The person who
made the alteration would surely have asked what was meant by 'minor
modification' before deleting it, he said.

FT  18 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Court Cavendish ahead despite interest
hedge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Court Cavendish, the nursing home operator which was one of a handful of
companies to disappoint the market in initial trading when it floated last
year, reported pre-tax profits ahead from Pounds 86,000 to Pounds 450,000
for the six months to October 31, in spite of a Pounds 600,000 exceptional
charge for an interest hedge.
In July, the shares failed to hold their issue price of 225p and fell to
207p by the close of first day dealings.
Yesterday, the shares rose 1p on the figures to close at 251p.
The board declared an interim dividend of 1.35p, payable from earnings after
exceptionals of 2.34p (1.79p).
Turnover on continuing activities rose to Pounds 7.17m (Pounds 6.87m).
Acquisitions contributed Pounds 287,000.
Net interest charges fell to Pounds 285,000 (Pounds 1.38m) as borrowings of
Pounds 24.7m were paid down with flotation proceeds of Pounds 38.6m. Cash
and deposits were Pounds 11.5m (Pounds 669,000) at the half-way stage.
The company is aiming to reach 3,000 beds at a rate of 500 beds a year for
the next three to five years, spending between Pounds 12m and Pounds 15m a
year. Initial expansion will be funded by the flotation proceeds and debt.
COMMENT
In a rising market, the shares are now trading above the issue price,
reflecting the company's success in mollifying institutions. Concerns, not
least about the quality of the management, have been soothed by assurances
about acquisition policy and trips around the homes. Analysts have been
encouraged by the 17 per cent gross return achieved on Pounds 11.6m of
assets purchased since the float. The return should hold up when the company
turns to debt finance in the next two years or so. The company says
going back to shareholders for more equity finance is a long-term
option. The forecast of Pounds 3.1m for the full year gives a rating of
17.  This looks high in a sub-sector rated at 20.8 and populated by
companies with better track records.

FT  18 JAN 94 / Central banker puts case for foreign control
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Israel's central bank governor has urged foreign investors to take a
controlling stake in some of the commercial banks which will be sold by the
government this year.
In an interview, Mr Jacob Frenkel trumpeted last year's breakthrough in
Israel's banking sector as the government took measures to restructure the
industry, encourage more competition, reduce concentration of ownership and
begin selling off the country's leading banks taken over in 1983 after a
share manipulation scandal.
'I would like to see a controlling interest in at least some of our banks by
foreign investors because international competition is the best recipe to
increase competition in the market,' Mr Frenkel said.
Mr Avraham Shochat, minister of finance, is expected to announce today the
government's go-ahead for the sale this year of ownership in Bank Hapoalim
and Bank Leumi, the country's two largest banking groups.
The government has defined a controlling stake as at least 20 per cent of
the shares and is expected to sell Bank Leumi first, allowing investors who
fail to buy Leumi to bid for Hapoalim later.
Last year the government sold blocks of shares in both banks through the Tel
Aviv stock exchange.
'The development of the Middle East in the peace era depends on the capacity
to develop efficient and effective intermediation mechanisms that will
channel finance and investment,' said Mr Frenkel.
'Any foreign investor looking at the Middle East will see Israel favourably
because we have established property rights, a legal system, a market
system, macro-economic stability and a strategy that is built on a
multi-year process of economic reform.'
The governor said 1993 had also been a watershed year in macro-economics as
the impact of the government's policy shift away from growth led by public
sector housing had been felt. Despite the 'drastic cut in public housing'
the economy had grown 3.5 per cent with industrial exports up 18 per cent
and unemployment down from 11.2 per cent to 10.4 per cent.
Mr Frenkel predicted the economy would grow at higher levels this year. The
Bank of Israel, he said, was determined to achieve its inflation target of 8
per cent for 1994. He strongly defended the recent hike in interest rates to
11.5 per cent, criticised by the Finance Ministry, saying it was essential
to curb inflation which rose last year by 11.2 per cent.
He said the reason for high inflation in 1993 was housing prices which grew
last year by 23.7 per cent as a result of the cut in public housing
construction, economic expansion and continued immigration. Inflation,
excluding housing, was 7.6 per cent last year.
The governor said privatisation would be speeded up this year. The
government has pledged to sell shares in companies such as El Al, the state
airline, and Israel Chemicals and plans to raise Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds
1.01bn) from the divestiture programme. 'I am convinced that the political
will, especially on the part of the prime minister, to see privatisation
move forward is absolute and not hesitating,' he said.
Mr Frenkel, however, warned that the budget deficit target for 1994 of less
than 3 per cent of gross domestic product might be difficult to achieve as
the government had to pay the unbudgeted costs of the peace process such as
the redeployment of Israeli troops in the occupied Gaza Strip and West Bank.
The first official Israeli economic delegation to visit Morocco returned
yesterday after a five-day tour of Rabat, Casablanca and Marrakech, marking
a breakthrough in Israeli-Moroccan relations.
The delegation, including senior businessmen in banking, industry and
tourism, met the Moroccan prime minister, six economic ministers, the heads
of the employers' and manufacturers' associations and leading Moroccan
companies.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Renault Agriculture, the farm machinery division of the French state-owned
motor vehicle group, yesterday announced a series of agreements aimed at
strengthening its position in the depressed farm equipment market.
The French group has agreed with John Deere of the US to exchange tractors
and diesel engines in the French market. It has also concluded an accord
with Massey Ferguson, the farm equipment group owned by Varity of the US, to
establish a joint design, development and manufacturing subsidiary and a
joint purchasing operation.
Under the terms of the agreement with John Deere, the world's largest
manufacturer of farm equipment, Renault Agriculture will receive diesel
engines from the US company's factory in Saran, south of Paris. In return,
Renault will supply tractors equipped with John Deere engines to the US
group. These will be sold under the John Deere marque.
Renault declined to disclose the volumes concerned, but said the agreement
with John Deere would satisfy a large proportion of its demand for engines.
It said the deal would allow the two companies to operate at their French
factories at 'a high level of activity'.
The agreement with Massey Ferguson involves the creation of a joint
subsidiary for development and manufacture in the areas of mechanical
engineering, hydraulics and electronics. The subsidiary, to be jointly owned
and managed by each of the partners, will be based at Beauvais, north of
Paris. It will concentrate on the development and manufacture of
transmissions.
The two companies will also establish a common purchasing body.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Proton, the Malaysian car manufacturer, has won its first export order in
Indonesia. Under a memorandum of understanding signed in Jakarta, Indonesia
will import between 1,500 and 3,000 Protons, which will be used as taxis.
The Proton sale forms part of a complex trade and investment deal being
negotiated between Malaysia and Indonesia.
Under agreements signed during a visit to Indonesia last week by Mr Anwar
Ibrahim, Malaysia's deputy prime minister and finance minister, Malaysia
will contribute Dollars 50m to a joint venture capital company which will
seek to develop small and medium-scale industries in Indonesia.
Negotiations are also under way on the possible sale to Malaysia of a number
of Indonesian transport aircraft, made by the state owned Industri Pesawat
Terban Nusantara, while Malaysia hopes to sell its own light trainer
aircraft to Jakarta.
Malaysia has said it is investigating the manufacture of Proton components
in Indonesia in order to avoid Indonesian car import duties of more than 200
per cent.
PT Citra Lamtoro, a company controlled by Mrs Hardijanti Rukmana, the
daughter of Indonesian President Suharto, is to import the Protons into
Indonesia.
A brother of Mrs Rukmana is already involved in car assembly operations in
Indonesia while another brother is part of an Indonesian group which
recently purchased the Lamborghini car company from Chrysler of the US.

<TEXT>
The US-Turkish company United BMB and Germany's Siemens have signed a
Dollars 581m contract to build a 950MW natural gas-fired power plant in the
former Soviet republic of Kazakhstan, writes Steve LeVine in Istanbul.
Company officials said the deal involved no cash. The Caspian Sea republic
has granted the two companies three proven oilfields that, over a 10-year
period, are expected to make up the contract price plus interest and the
cost of oilfield development. About 30 test wells have been drilled in the
fields, located in the Aktubinsk region, and they are estimated to contain
60m tonnes of recoverable oil, according to BMB's chairman, Mr Ali Riza
Bozkurt.
The consortium, to be led by Siemens, will build the combined-cycle plant,
capable of operating on natural gas or kerosene, over a three-year period in
Aktubinsk. United BMB will build the plant, and Siemens will supply the
technology, including turbines and electrical equipment. Construction is to
begin after the consortium and its government partner choose an oil company
to help develop the field, after which a production-sharing agreement must
be signed with Kazakhstan.

FT  18 JAN 94 / Greek demand could delay accession deal

The current Greek presidency of the European Union wants to limit the amount
of regional aid offered to the remote areas of Sweden, Finland, Austria and
Norway, in a proposal which threatens to complicate the closing stages of
these countries' already difficult negotiations on EU entry.
European Commission negotiators in November offered each of the four
applicants the highest level of EU structural aid - so-called objective 1
status - for their most disadvantaged regions.
Athens wants a clear delineation between some Ecu100bn (Dollars 112bn) in EU
funds available in 1994-9 to the poorest regions - such as Greece itself,
Portugal, Ireland and Spain - and structural aid to Nordic and Alpine
regions whose average income is above the normal objective 1 eligibility
threshold. Greece itself should get more than Ecu19bn in EU regional aid in
1994-99.
While it is not yet clear whether the Greek presidency's proposal, presented
in a confidential paper, will gain the support of its partners, the mere
suggestion that the northern areas of the Nordic countries could come off
worse inside Europe could harden already sceptical opinion in those
countries against EU entry. The Greek proposal says that a 'transitional'
and 'additional ad hoc effort' should be made 'in a limited number of areas'
in the four countries, to take account of their harsh climate and
remoteness.
It calls for a new and separate transitional fund to finance regional aid in
a number of these areas. The proposal would exclude Norrbotten, Sweden's
northern-most province, and two of Norway's four northern counties, from
objective 1 status, the treasure trove of regional policy.
Athens says these and the Etela-Pohjanma area of eastern Finland should be
'funded separately (over and above) from the existing funds of the (EU
regional policy) regulation, which are to be distributed solely among the
existing 12 member states'.

Support for Swedish and Norwegian membership of the EU has begun to increase
for the first time in many months, according to latest opinion polls, writes
Christopher Brown-Humes in Stockholm. In Sweden, 34 per cent of voters are
in favour compared with 26 per cent in December. In Norway, support for the
Yes camp has risen by three percentage points to 33 per cent.

FT  18 JAN 94 / Bosnia Serbs threaten 'all-out war'
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The leaders of Bosnia's warring communities resume partition talks in Geneva
today against a backdrop of intensified fighting and few positive
indications of an imminent end to the war.
In another sign that the prospects for agreement are bleak, Mr Radovan
Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, told the assembly of his self-styled Serb
state that the Moslems would be faced with 'all-out war' if the fresh round
of peace talks failed to yield an agreement.
His threats were aimed at Mr Alija Izetbegovic, Bosnia's president, who,
apparently emboldened by recent military victories against Croat forces,
last week reiterated his pledge to regain control of land which was mostly
populated by Moslems before the Serbian onslaught. Croat and Bosnian
officials yesterday met following a Croatian proposal to create a
confederation with their Moslem adversaries once a deal was reached.
Croatian President Franjo Tudjman is trying to convince Mr Izetbegovic that
the restoration of the Croat-Moslem alliance would help assure the future of
a rump Moslem state. Mr Tudjman and his Serbian counterpart, Mr Slobodan
Milosevic, were due to join today's talks.
In Geneva, UN officials were reported to have rejected the use of air
strikes against Serb targets as proposed under a Nato initiative. Following
his fact-finding mission on the feasibility of air strikes, Mr Yasushi
Akashi, the UN special envoy, met leading UN political and aid officials. He
came out against the use of air power to open the airport in Tuzla, the
biggest government stronghold, and to secure the rotation of Canadian
peace-keepers in Srebrenica, the Moslem enclave in eastern Bosnia.
He reportedly indicated that the use of air support would stop the passage
of overland aid convoys to Tuzla and said that agreement in principle had
been reached to allow Dutch troops to relieve the Canadian company in
Srebrenica.

<TEXT>
Germany's largest union, IG Metall, yesterday warned it might strike this
year and the leader of the largest public services union, the OeTV, said pay
talks would be very difficult, Reuter reports from Frankfurt.
The two unions, which will negotiate wage deals for almost 7m workers, are
under fire from employers who say wage freezes are essential to counter
problems caused by Germany's worst postwar recession.
Mr Walter Riester, deputy president of the IG Metall engineering union,
said: 'It is possible that we will not be able to manage without a strike.'
IG Metall has claimed a 5.5 per cent pay rise for 1994, while public
servants want 4 per cent.

FT  18 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Reuters strong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
News and financial information agency Reuters Holdings pushed forward in
response to positive weekend press comment over last week's announcement of
US expansion. Acquisition of the Quotron equity dealing arm of US bank
Citicorp saw the Reuters share price up 41 at best before being dragged back
by US selling to close a net 18 ahead at 1920p.
Most analysts recommend the stock up to at least Pounds 20 a share, with the
more bullish seeing it hit Pounds 22 to reflect an American Depositary
Receipt price of Dollars 100.
There is also growing conviction that Reuters will shortly announce a share
split, probably with end-of-year figures on February 8, in order to make the
stock more attractive.
The earthquake in Los Angeles rumbled through sections of the insurance
community, with BAT Industries and Willis Corroon the two groups to suffer
from nervousness over heavy claims.
Tobacco-to-insurance conglomerate BAT has a US subsidiary called Farmers.
Although Farmers merely manages mutual underwriting pools and has very
little exposure, BAT shares declined 5 1/2 to 521p.
Meanwhile, insurance broker Willis Corroon, which has a US associate that
does place earthquake insurance, dipped 4 to 229p. However, insurance
analysts said few property owners in the San Fernando valley took out
subsidiary premiums to cover earthquakes.
Food retailers managed to stay in mostly positive territory, continuing
their strong new year run. BZW, one of the leading houses in the sector,
yesterday reiterated its neutral stance, a move which was taken as a
positive signal, given the one-way flow of negative news undermining the
sector in the past 12 months.
With peace breaking out in the niggling price war, BZW said that price
stability between the supermarket protaganists is now a 'real possibility'.
The broker forecasts the sector to outperform the market by 10 per cent in
the first quarter.
Yesterday Kwik Save moved ahead 6 to 624p, Argyll 2 to 303p and Nurdin &amp;
Peacock 11 to 200p. However, J. Sainsbury, which moved on to the BZW buy
list, slipped 2 to 476p.
Television group Carlton Communications jumped 20 to 971p after it was
announced that the company had received acceptances for 78.4 per cent of the
shares in Central Independent Television by Friday afternoon and the offer
was unconditional.
Acquisition of Central will render Carlton the biggest independent
television group in the UK and remove worries over competition in its video
production side. Central shares rose 17 to 2980p.
Speculation of a rights issue at Stanley Leisure, the gambling and gaming
group, found some support among leisure analysts, who pointed out that the
acquisitive company's shares were at an all-time high. Yesterday they put on
a further 2 to 335p in spite of the cash call rumours.
'It is preparing a war chest,' said one seasoned hand, with small betting
chains said to be in the company's sights rather than one large acquisition.
Figures showing subdued inflation and talk of interest rate cuts, both in
the UK and Germany, lifted several building and property stocks.
Among construction companies, Banner Homes rose 12 to 159p, Wilson Bowden 13
to 520p, Bryant Group 5 to 182p, Persimmon 12 to 345p, John Laing 4 to 333p,
Barratt Developments 14 to 252p, John Mowlem 8 to 155p and Taylor Woodrow 6
to 161p.
Building materials groups were also firm. Marley moved forward 7 to 205p,
Ibstock Johnsen 5 to 90p, Tarmac 8 to 196p and Pilkington 6 to 192p. Adding
to the positive tone, British cement producers said conditions looked to
favour an increase in cement prices this year. Rugby Group climbed 7 to
326p, but Blue Circle retreated after an initial burst and closed unchanged
at 366p.
Costain was lifted by speculation that Hanson may be eyeing its US coal
interests, finishing 3 1/2 up at 36 1/2 p.
Bank note printer De La Rue was held back to a rise of 3 at 914p as one
broker recommended a switch into Bowater, up 12 at 510p.
Spirits and brewing group Guinness was the worst performing Footsie stock as
a number of brokers expressed caution over the company's trading outlook.
Analysts said recent meetings with the company have done little to dispel
concern over its prospective dull earnings flow.
Yesterday, SG Warburg and Nomura were among those said to be making negative
comments on the stock, which closed 11 down at 463p.
Whisky producer Burn Stewart was recommended by NatWest Securities and the
shares gained 6 at 125p.
BZW trimmed its forecasts for Unilever on worries over US detergents, among
other things, and the broker retained its 'hold' stance due to the low yield
and slack earnings per share growth. However, reiterating its positive
stance, Strauss Turnbull pointed out the stock's undemanding rating and
recent underperformance. The shares closed 10 ahead at 1175p.
Conglomerate Tomkins was the best performer among FT-SE 100 stocks,
advancing 12 to 267p, after Hoare Govett turned buyer of the stock, having
previously had an 'undervalue' rating on it.
BTR, which has underperformed the market in recent sessions, improved 5 to
365p after it confirmed plans to seek a listing on the LSE for Graham Group,
which comprises its two distribution businesses. Volume was 5.8m.
Clayton, which said on Friday that it was in talks that could lead to a bid
for the company, jumped another 42 to 145p as further developments were
awaited.

FT  18 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Provision worries hit BAe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fears that British Aerospace may include provisions of around Pounds 200m in
its next set of results saw the shares decline by 2.6 per cent, one of the
worst performers in the FT-SE 100 Index. Talk in the market suggested that
BAe would be making the provisions because of continuing problems at its
troubled regional jets division, following the failure of talks last year
with Taiwan Aerospace Corporation for a proposed joint venture.
Sentiment was further damaged by suggestions that Saudi Arabia may
renegotiate the lucrative contract for Hawk aircraft; and weekend press
reports that the UK government may replace its transport fleet with US
Lockheed aircraft instead of a European rival.
BAe is part of a consortium developing the European alternative. The shares
gave up 10 to 414p in trade of 2.5m.

FT  18 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first day of the new equity account brought a calmer session in the
derivatives sector, with reduced volume in the traded options and futures
trading in a tight range, writes Joel Kibazo.
Aggressive buying at the opening of the session saw the March contract on
the FT-SE 100 advance strongly to 3,439. This turned out to be the day's
peak for the early interest soon waned leaving the contract to drift lower
by mid-morning, pulling the underlying cash market lower.
March traded in a 20 point range for the next few hours before a
disappointing Wall Street brought further selling of the contract.
It finished at 3,415, down 10 on Friday's close and at a two-point discount
to its fair value premium to cash which fell to 5 points on this account.
Volume at 10,497 lots was down on recent levels.
Turnover in traded options also fell back sharply closing at 42,559
contracts against 57,439 trades on Friday. That sharp decline in the total
was in part brought about by reduced business in the FT-SE 100 options which
saw volume of only 11,041 contracts. Friday's turnover in the FT-SE 100
options had been a healthy 23,233 lots. However active trading was seen in
the Euro FT-SE 100 option in which 6,244 lots were dealt.
Dealers said a single house had bought the 'call spread' in Asda accounting
for the day's volume of 5,764 lots which made it the most actively traded
stock option. It was followed by British Gas at 2,295 contracts. Some 2,070
lots were dealt in Hanson, and 1,321 in Argyll Group. Other active trades
included Tesco, SmithKline Beecham and Commercial Union.

FT  18 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Second line stocks continue to
outperform - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London's equity market built on last Friday's outstanding performance, but
closed well below the day's highs in the wake of a stuttering opening by
Wall Street.
The US market was hit at the outset of trading by news of an earthquake
affecting much of Los Angeles.
Nevertheless, the FT-SE 100 Index remained strongly in positive territory
after further encouraging news on the UK economy in the form of better than
expected producer prices and output numbers for December, plus industrial
production figures for November.
Significantly, dealers highlighted another strong showing by the stock
market's second-line issues as a powerful indicator of the underlying
confidence in UK markets. Some determined buying across the board drove
second-rank stocks sharply higher and pushed the FT-SE Mid 250 Index up 33.1
to an all-time peak of 3,948.8.
Turnover in London markets showed no signs of flagging after the recent long
run of exceptionally high volumes. Yesterday saw 808.3m shares change hands,
with non-Footsie stocks accounting for 556.8m shares, or 68.8 per cent of
the total.
Figures released yesterday showed that the value of business in the equity
market last Friday was worth Pounds 2.03bn, well above recent levels.
Share prices rose from the outset of trading, driven by renewed buying of
the March future on the Footsie, said to have been executed by some of the
big US investment banks. It was pointed out, however, that the US houses
often act for leading UK institutions.
And dealers also said there were strong indications that at least one of the
powerful Scottish institutions had plunged into the market last Friday.
The early futures-inspired surge quickly ran out of steam, however, and it
was buying, sometimes low key, in the cash market that sustained share
prices and kept them in positive territory.
The FT-SE 100 Index rose more than seven points during the first hour of
trading, before slipping back in mid-morning and then staging another strong
upward move which saw it reach a session peak of 3,421.1. Thereafter, prices
drifted back, influenced by the US earthquake news, to close a net 7.2 ahead
at 3,407.8.
Some of the leading marketmakers said they were taken by surprise by last
Friday's burst of buying interest, which they said was the result of sector
rotation and the recent realignment of fund managers' asset allocations. But
most remained confident that the market is underpinned by expected interest
rate cuts. 'If sterling continues to rise then rate cuts are definitely on
the agenda,' said one. Others adopted a much more cautious line, however.
'The market feels heavy at Footsie 3,400; it is hard work from here
onwards,' said another.
Insurance issues were among the market's best performers early in the
session but came off their best levels after the earthquake disaster news.
But other financial stocks continued to attract sizeable support, notably
the merchant banks, where those with big stock market operations were well
to the fore. SG Warburg and Kleinwort Benson were outstanding.
Oil shares were mixed in spite of the sharp rise in crude oil prices, which
responded to the cold snap in the US and lingering hopes that an emergency
Opec meeting could still occur.

FT  18 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow finishes steady ahead of
corporate news
</HEADLINE>

Wall Street
US blue chips were looking a shade firmer by the close in New York as the
market marked time ahead of a slew of corporate results due today, writes
Richard Waters in New York.
Following its 25-point climb on Friday to a record high, the Dow Jones
Industrial Average blue chip indicator initially receded on profit-taking,
before inching ahead to 3,870.29, up 3.09 on the day. But the more broadly
based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was still down 1.61 at the close at 473.30. The
Nasdaq composite lost 0.13 at 792.18.
Largely as a result of the Martin Luther King holiday in the US yesterday,
which closed banks and government offices, trading volume on the New York SE
was moderate, totalling 234m shares.
The holiday closed the government bond market and in the process robbed the
stock market of one potential driving force behind share prices. The
Treasury bond market had ended the previous week in nervous mood, with the
yield on the benchmark 30-year long bond at 6.3 per cent.
Shares in property/casualty insurers suffered as investors expressed fears
about potential losses from the earthquake which hit southern California
before dawn yesterday. Allstate, reckoned to be one of the biggest insurers
in California, fell Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 28 3/8 before recovering
slightly to Dollars 28 5/8 . Gryphon, an insurer which specialises in
earthquake insurance, lost Dollars 1 at one stage to trade at Dollars 12 7/8
before rallying to Dollars 13 3/8 .
Elsewhere, with little specific company news to focus on, the market
continued to position itself for the onset of the reporting season, with a
clutch of the largest banks due today, as well as Chrysler.
First Chicago chose to bring forward the announcement of its results to
yesterday to avoid the rush and in the process confirmed the bullish tone
for banks set last week by JP Morgan and Citicorp. Its earnings per share
for the fourth quarter were well ahead of market expectations, helping to
push its shares up Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 43 1/4 , though they later fell
back to Dollars 42 3/8 .
After the run-up in its shares at the end of last week, Citicorp receded
Dollars 1 to Dollars 41 1/8 , though it remains close to its 12-month high.

Toronto stocks climbed to a fourth consecutive record close, with the TSE
300 index ending 1.2 per cent higher and moderately below the session's
peak.
The index was finally 55.1 ahead at 4,544.2 after hitting 4,555.8. The
run-up was fuelled by sharp gains in golds, financial services, base metals,
consumer products, conglomerates and paper and forestry stocks. Volume was
heavy at 71.7m shares valued at CDollars 931.1m.

FT  18 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei edges lower as
Pacific Basin consolidates
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Uncertainty over the fate of the government's political reform bill prompted
profit-taking, and the Nikkei average receded 1.3 per cent in light trading,
writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue index closed 248.33 down at 18,725.37. The Topix index lost
9.71 at 1,515.91, but in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index firmed 2.18 to
1,256.37.
The Nikkei opened at the day's high of 18,911.89 and retreated to the
session's low of 18,646.06 in the morning.
Traders also blamed the fall on weakness in the bond market. The yield on
the No 157 10-year benchmark finished at 3.205 per cent, the highest for 1
1/2 months.
Worries of oversupply, caused by last week's announcement by the Ministry of
Finance that it would sell bonds outright for the first time in 11 years to
finance the forthcoming economic stimulus package, triggered profit-taking.
The Finance Ministry, which usually sells bonds with repurchase agreements,
is expected to supply the market with some Y900bn in outright bonds.
Volume shrank to 280m shares from 468m, falling below the 300m mark for the
first time in eight trading days. Declines led advances by 701 to 333, with
133 issues unchanged.
In spite of the fall in share prices on the first section, the second
section saw continued firm demand from short-term investors. The second
section index advanced 17.64 to 2,017.36, rising for the 13th consecutive
day to recover the 2,000 level for the first time since November 16 last
year.
Bank stocks were lower on arbitrage selling. Industrial Bank of Japan lost
Y30 to Y2,870 and Fuji Bank declined Y40 to Y1,960.
Profit-taking depressed gas companies, which had previously gained ground on
hopes of higher profits due to industry restructuring. Tokyo Gas slipped Y10
to Y540.
Buying by foreign investors supported Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, which
firmed Y13,000 to Y833,000, and East Japan Railway, Y7,000 higher at
Y476,000.
Sega Enterprises jumped Y320 to Y9,500 on reports that the video game maker
has tied up with Microsoft, of the US, to develop game programs.
In Osaka, the OSE average declined 75.25 to 20,711.86 in volume of 47.2m
shares.
Roundup
The region saw a less active day's trading than for some time.
HONG KONG ended a featureless session slightly higher, the Hang Seng index
gaining 18.67 at 10,792.9, as turnover drifted back to HKDollars 5.6bn, its
lowest level in three weeks.
Bank shares did well on expectations that Bank of East Asia would report
good earnings today. HSBC Holdings moved up HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 108 and
Hang Seng Bank added 50 cents at HKDollars 72.
SEOUL lost ground for the third consecutive session, the composite stock
index shedding 5.40 to 863.25.
Reports that Sungkyong had given up its second mobile telecom bid and would
try to buy stakes in the existing network boosted the shares of other
companies involved in the project.
Yukong and Kolon International went the day's limit up, adding Won1,300 each
to close at Won36,500 and Won33,500 respectively.
TAIWAN saw the weighted index swing widely, after a 5.6 per cent gain on
Saturday, closing 12.19 off at 6,054.93. Turnover was TDollars 105bn.
Reports that a proposal to raise the Dollars 5bn ceiling on combined foreign
investment in the market had been postponed dampened sentiment.
Among financial stocks, China Trust rose by its daily 7 per cent limit to
TDollars 74.50 and ICBC surged TDollars 4 to TDollars 81.50 in heavy trade.
Among the banks, First Commercial advanced TDollars 12 to TDollars 231.
SINGAPORE fell back in a consolidation phase. The Straits Times Industrial
index lost 25.82, or 1.12 per cent, to 2,277.04. Volume came to 275.7m
shares as declines led gains by 314 to 40.
KUALA LUMPUR reversed Friday's strong gains and the composite index fell
30.0, or 2.65 per cent, to 1,104.14. Turnover amounted to MDollars 1.7bn.
AUSTRALIA ended the session at its highest level since 1987 as the All
Ordinaries index climbed 31.8, or 1.4 per cent, to 2,238.2. Turnover
totalled ADollars 679m.
News Corp followed Friday's rise of 51 cents with another 44-cent gain to
ADollars 10.20.
Westpac saw 20.6m shares traded and moved ahead 7 cents to ADollars 4.82.
Elsewhere in the banks sector, NAB advanced 28 cents to ADollars 12.38, CBA
was 4 cents higher at ADollars 9.20 and ANZ firmed 2 cents to ADollars 5.02.
BHP put on 38 cents at ADollars 18.70 after its petroleum unit said that oil
production from the Griffin project was expected to peak at 80,000 b/pd.
NEW ZEALAND increased its performance to set its highest level since October
1989. The NZSE-40 capital index rose 15.97 to 2,241.96.
Fletcher Challenge added 8 cents at NZDollars 3.48 and Carter Holt Harvey 4
cents at NZDollars 3.84.
BANGKOK declined nearly 3 per cent, led by weakness in the finance, property
and banking sectors. The SET index lost 42.56 at 1,474.11.
Communication issues were down in spite of expectations of gains ahead of
today's listing of Shinawatra Satellite. TelecomAsia shed Bt7 to Bt127.
BOMBAY saw profit-taking erode early gains, but the BSE index still ended
84.17 higher at a provisional 4,022.91.
KARACHI finished at a record high, the KSE index adding 14.90 at 2,405.42.

FT  18 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Rate cut hopes help Stockholm
up 2.5% to peak
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Most of the senior markets continued their downward movement, writes Our
Markets Staff.
STOCKHOLM finished 2.5 per cent ahead at a record high with unusually strong
demand spurring turnover to an all-time peak. The Affarsvarlden index rose
37.7 to 1,545.9 in turnover of SKr3.94bn.
Mr Peter Tron of Unibank said that selective buying of index heavyweights
and expectations of an interest rate cut by the Riksbank on Thursday were
behind the rise.
The advance was a continuation of last week's rally and followed a strong
performance throughout last year.
Bikuben Securities, which believes that Stockholm has the potential to be
the Scandinavian outperformer this year, says that rises will be based on
lower interest rates and corporate earnings growth, which is a direct result
of the depreciation of the local currency.
Among issues hitting new highs, Volvo B shares soared SKr31 to SKr658 in
heavy trade, partly on revised earnings forecasts by brokerages and upbeat
press comment.
Strong US demand pushed Ericsson SKr29 higher to SKr379.
Forest sector shares showed the biggest gains, backed by news that prices on
several key products will be raised during the spring. MoDo, the pulp and
paper group leapt SKr22 to SKr345, while Stora, Europe's largest forest
products group, added SKr25 to SKr467.
FRANKFURT was modestly lower across the board pressured by a 1.8 per cent
loss in Daimler, down DM15 at DM805.
The DAX index eased 4.44 to 2,137.38, but retreated sharply in the after
market, with the Ibis indicated index losing a further 35.5 to 2,115.56.
Turnover was DM8.8bn.
Kleinwort Benson, in its latest European handbook, notes that it is now
recommending an overweight position in France relative to Germany. This
assessment is based on the view that Germany remains vulnerable to a
withdrawal of US money, while French corporate earnings are less vulnerable
to downgrades than German companies.
Metallgesellschaft was the day's major winner, coming back DM27 or 12.6 per
cent to DM241 following the successful outcome of weekend talks among the
creditor banks. Another of last week's losers, Siemens, eased DM1.00 to
DM720.50.
Commerzbank firmed DM1.80 to DM376.50 on news of a tie-up with Winterthur
Insurance of Switzerland.
ZURICH finished firmer but off earlier highs after news about the Los
Angeles earthquake made for uncertain trading. The SMI index added 20.5 to
3,011 after an earlier high of 3,026.7.
Insurers were especially hit by news of the earthquake, with Swiss Re
registered shares falling SFr14 to SFr690.
However, Winterthur registered shares, which were sought on news about the
venture with Commerzbank, ended SFr9 firmer at SFr786, but off an earlier
high at 805.
Shares in SMH continued their recovery which began late last week. The
registered shares surged SFr10 to SFr210, and the bearer added SFr29 to
SFr979. Elsewhere in industrials, Alusuisse registered shares added SFr11 or
1.8 per cent to SFr632 and Holderbank bearers rose SFr40 or 4.4 per cent to
SFr943.
PARIS weakened steadily during the afternoon in line with Germany so that
the CAC-40 index ended 27.47 down at 2,234.78. Turnover eased to FFr4.5bn
from FFr5.5bn.
Outside of the index Eurotunnel dipped FFr2.90 to FFr50.70 on reports that
UK and French construction companies are claiming up to Pounds 1bn which
they claim has been unpaid by the tunnel operator.
AMSTERDAM was helped higher by a substantial gain seen in Boskalis, although
volume in the stock was reported to have been low, the shares rising Fl 3.00
or 6.4 per cent to Fl 49.50. The AEX index gained 2.31 to 422.93.
In contrast BolsWessanen slipped Fl 1.10 to Fl 44.80 as some investors
reacted negatively to results which came out at the end of last week.
MILAN made a confident start to the new monthly account with the weekend
announcement that elections will be held on March 27 resolving a major
political uncertainty. The Comit index rose 12.44 or 2.1 per cent to 615.30.
Montedison led the charge amongst blue chips, gaining nearly L52.70 or 5.7
per cent to L961.70 in massive volume of 155.7m shares. Olivetti also gained
sharply, up L102 to L2,267 on speculation about its chances of winning the
race for Italy's second cellular telephone licence, bidding for which closed
on Saturday.
Elsewhere, optimism over the IMI privatisation helped sentiment but Banca
Commerciale Italiana dipped L37 to L4,738 amid arbitrage selling ahead of
its planned privatisation set for late February.

FT  18 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets: German pessimism is 'overdone'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The extreme volatility of south-east Asian markets, where investors
scrambled to bank some profits after the recent phenomenal rises,
overshadowed the markets last week.
Sharply divergent trends, however, were also seen in Europe.
Germany was the Continent's big loser as the Metallgesellschaft rescue saga
rumbled on. Nikko Securities says that some strong, non-German selling was
seen amid the uncertainty and the unspecified earnings implications for the
major German banks that would have resulted from a failure of the rescue
effort.
In addition, the Siemens results, and more importantly the earnings outlook
they have given, indicated that the earnings forecasts generally adhered to
are probably too optimistic.
UBS takes the view, however, that last week's swing from optimism to
pessimism, which took the DAX index down to 2,141.82 on Friday, went too
far. 'With still a chance of a cut in the leading interest rates this week
and support from a strong dollar, we expect the market to stabilise around
the 2,150 to 2,175 level.'
Finland, Europe's top performing market last year with a 91 per cent climb
in the HEX index, was also last week's best performer, as measured by the
FT-Actuaries World Index.
Strong foreign demand, particularly from US investors, was seen in the
forestry sec-tor in response to the outlook for lower interest rates, the
stronger markka, and optimism that this year will see positive economic
growth for the first time since 1990.
The advance also accompanied the run-up to Sunday's first round in the
coun-try's presidential election, which resulted in two pro-European Union
candidates winning through to the sec-ond and decisive round on February 6.
In the Far East, Tokyo remained on the upward track as renewed foreign
demand encouraged local investors back into the market. Elsewhere, it was a
hectic week of switchback trading during which daily swings of 5 per cent
and more were common. Kuala Lumpur was the week's biggest loser, with even a
9.25 per cent upward bounce on Friday unable to erase all of the losses
suffered earlier in the week.

FT  18 JAN 94 / Markets Report: Dollars and Pounds remain strong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar and sterling dom-inated currency trading yesterday in a session
made quiet by the partial US holiday in honour of Martin Luther King, writes
Philip Gawith.
The pound took heart from an encouraging batch of UK economic data during
London trading and recovered from small early losses caused by profit-taking
after last week's strong gains. The dollar moved to its highest level
against the D-Mark since August 1991. Investors avoided the D-Mark, largely
because of disenchantment about Germany's economic prospects and worries
about developments in Russia.
The dollar ended around its highest level of the day against the D-Mark
after a quiet European session. However, it eased slightly against the yen
and was barely changed at the close against sterling.
In London, the US currency's close of DM1.7553 was nearly  1/2 pfennig up
from Friday's finish. It slipped against the yen to Y111.08 from Friday's
Y111.215. Sterling finished at Dollars 1.4918, near to London's Dollars
1.4921 level before the weekend. In New York, the dollar ended at DM1.7525
and Y111.13 and the pound at Dollars 1.4935.
Yesterday's quiet trading did not deter some observers from predicting
strong further gains for the dollar. Mr Norbert Walter, chief economist at
Deutsche Bank AG, was reported as forecasting that the dollar would rise
into a corridor between DM1.80 and DM1.85 in the second quarter and remain
there until 1995. However, in remarks to a capital markets seminar, he added
that he expected the Bundesbank and US Federal Reserve would intervene to
sell dollars if the dollar/D-Mark rate topped DM1.85.
Sterling put in another robust performance, closing at DM2.6184 compared
with DM2,6118 on Friday. It started the day at DM2.605 after a spate of
unfavourable stories about the weakness of the government prompted selling
in Asia. But it touched DM2.62 in mid-morning in London after the release of
favourable industrial production and producer price data.
Analysts said the UK output data were bullish for sterling because they
reflected good growth and so supported the government's reluctance last week
to cut interest rates. Although the output price index for UK manufactured
products rose by 0.5 per cent between November and December, and so was
above the 0.3 per cent consensus forecast, economists were reassured that
inflationary pressures were subdued because prices excluding food, drink,
tobacco and petrol increased by only 0.1 per cent.
However, according to Mr Brian Martin of Citibank, the market is beginning
to wonder about the impact of sterling's strength on UK export prospects. He
said recent CBI figures which showed export order books falling suggested
that if the pound strengthened much more it would harm exports. He said he
felt the government would try to stem the rise were the pound to reach the
DM2.65 level.
The D-Mark was generally softer in late European trading as investors took
precautionary positions ahead of Thursday's Bundesbank council meeting. Many
analysts do not expect the central bank to alter interest rates this week,
but few doubt that monetary policy will be relaxed in the coming weeks.
'There is little enthusiasm for the D-Mark at the moment,' said one US
trader in London. 'Although the odds seem stacked against a German rate cut
this week, a prevailing air of gloom about the German economy makes it a
risky play.'
Mr Chris Turner, a currency strategist of Barclays de Zoete Wedd, said he
doubted that the Bundesbank would cut rates as it was sensitive to the
recent rate of decline of the D-Mark. However, Citibank's Mr Martin said he
did not feel that the D-Mark would decline much further as other European
governments were relying on exports to stimulate economic recovery and would
not want their currencies to strengthen too much against it.
The resignation of Mr Yegor Gaidar, the chief Russian economic reformer,
also weighed on the German currency because of Germany's relative proximity
to Russia and in spite of Germany's limited economic links with the former
Soviet Union.
The rouble fell victim to Russia's deepening political crisis yesterday,
tumbling 3.5 per cent in Moscow to a record low of 1,402 to the dollar on
fears that economic reforms would grind to a halt.
Dealers said the currency, which has already fallen 12 per cent this year,
would continue its steep decline. Banks were alarmed by the weekend
departure of Mr Gaidar, who refused to join the new government. Some Moscow
based bankers forecast that the rouble was likely to fall to 1,500 to the
dollar this month.
The Australian dollar was a focus of attention in London as it breached a
resistance level of 69.25 US cents. BZW's Mr Turner said this reflected the
recent increase in commodity prices and a strong flow of funds into
Australian equities. The Australian dollar closed yesterday at USDollars
0.6961, up from Friday's USDollars 0.6899.
UK money markets were quiet yesterday. The initial shortage of Pounds 450m
was revised upwards to Pounds 600m and the Bank of England provided the UK
money market with Pounds 615m of assistance. With much liquidity in the
market, overnight rates touched 2 per cent at one stage before moving back
up towards 5 1/2 per cent.

FT  18 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmer's Viewpoint): A season
of flood, mud and misery - Seeds are perishing and sugar-beets remain
unharvested in Britain's sodden fields
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID RICHARDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Apart from a few snow showers there has been no precipitation of any
significance in Norfolk for four days, but the lawn outside the office
window of my farmhouse is flooded in several places to a depth of two to
three inches. It has been like that for at least six weeks and as I write I
can see that the pair of blackbirds who have recently adopted the largest
puddle as their bathing place are back for their morning dip.
Beyond the garden hedge is a field of wheat - at least that is what was
planted at the end of November after the sugar-beet had been lifted from the
already wet land. The seeds did not go in at all well and by no means all
have so far germinated. The soil was saturated by 30 inches of rain during
the six months before planting (compared with a long-term annual average of
23 inches per year) and I was not very optimistic at the time.
In the event almost continuous rain since the beginning of December has
'puddled' on the surface and in some places, such as the inevitable tractor
wheel marks made during cultivations and planting, water has been lying ever
since. It is highly unlikely that seeds beneath these mini-floods will have
survived. Moreover, in a low corner on the far wide of the field about half
an acre is flooded to a depth of several inches. We tried clearing drains
and ditches that might allow the water to run away but to no avail. The soil
is saturated and cannot take any more - that area must now be considered a
total write off.
At the back of the farmyard there are lambs on a meadow. But it does not
look much like a meadow at present. In fact there is more mud than grass -
the inevitable result of tiny hooves on saturated land together with the
wheelings of the tractor and trailer used to deliver roots for the lambs to
eat.
I am at least thankful that we do not have outdoor pigs on this farm. After
a series of mild, dry winters, and attracted by the relative economy of
keeping pigs outside, without expensive buildings, many farmers have adopted
outdoor systems. Some have put pigs on to land that is frankly unsuitable.
Only sandy, free-draining soils are really appropriate.
But this winter is illustrating why many pig farmers, myself included,
brought our pigs inside, off inappropriate land, many years ago. For pigs
are far harder on the land than sheep. Quite apart from their habit of
'rooting' the soil with their snouts, they carry several times as much
weight as sheep on feet that are not much bigger.
When the land is as wet as it is now pigs sink up to their bellies. Indeed
they find it difficult to get around at all in deep mud and it is even worse
when that mud freezes into a landscape as hard and abrasive as petrified
volcanic lava.
Furthermore pigs have no woolly coats to keep them warm and dry during the
worst excesses of winter. I feel sorry for them and for those who have to
look after them under such conditions.
But my greatest immediate worry is for 30 acres of unharvested sugar-beet.
They should of course, have been harvested long ago, in line with the
recommendation by British Sugar, the monopoly processor of all UK beet, that
roots should be lifted and piled way before Christmas.
That is what we usually try to do; but last season, a heavy national crop
and the decision of British Sugar to extend the processing season in order
to make better use of its factories, meant that some of our November-lifted
roots were still on the farm until the end of February. By that time some of
them had gone rotten and British Sugar refused to accept them. Indeed we had
to sort hundreds of tonnes by hand to remove the rotten ones and sell the
rejects at a low price for sheep and cattle feed.
Needless to say we wanted to avoid a repeat of that experience and when the
same situation appeared to be building up again - in other words that
British Sugar might again extend processing until the end of February or
beyond - we, along with a great many other sugar-beet growers, decided to
take the risk of leaving some lifting until the new year. The reasoning
behind this was that the beets keep a lot better in the soil than in a heap.
Unfortunately we reckoned without the rain and at the last count some 5 per
cent of the national sugar-beet crop remained in the ground. In Norfolk,
where I farm, the figure was 12 per cent.
Sugar-beet growers are now battling to recover what they can of the crop in
the full knowledge that they are unlikely to harvest it all. The contractor
who lifts our beet, for instance, last week spent two and a half days
digging his machine out of a bog on one of our fields - a bog that had never
been there before.
At a potential value of about Pounds 600 an acre the 30 acres at risk on our
farm are worth Pounds 20,000. But the land on which they are growing is
scheduled for set-aside in 1994. To qualify for the arable area payment on
that land we should, according to EU regulations, have cleared the land by
January 15. It was therefore with great relief that we learned last weekend
that the minister of agriculture, Mrs Gillian Shephard, has succeeded in
persuading officials in Brussels to extend the deadline to the end of
February.
Now the battle with the elements is to get as many beets as possible lifted
and delivered to processing factories before they are closed, probably
during the third week in February, by British Sugar - the company that got
us into this mess in the first place.

FT  18 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Suppliers braced for aluminium
output cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Suppliers of bauxite and alumina, the main raw materials for aluminium, are
bracing themselves to face some of the worst market conditions in living
memory if talks, starting in Brussels today, for co-ordinate cuts in
international aluminium production are successful.
Even without more cuts by aluminium producers, western world alumina is
heading for a supply surplus of more than 1m tonnes in 1994 and next year
compared with demand of about 34m tonnes, says Mr Tim Armstrong at the CRU
International research organisation. 'If substantial (aluminium) cuts are
agreed, the market for alumina (aluminium oxide) and bauxite (aluminium ore)
will be appalling. Prices will go to historically low levels and stay there
for a couple of years.'
Trade representatives from Australia, Canada, the European Union, Norway,
Russia and the US start two days of negotiations this week and hope to agree
terms for a reduction in world annual aluminium output of up to 2m tonnes to
help bring supply and demand back into balance.
Australia is by far the biggest producer of aluminium's raw materials, with
an annual capacity of about 42m tonnes of bauxite and 13m tonnes of alumina,
according to Billiton-Enthoven Metals, part of the Royal Dutch/Shell group.
Other big bauxite suppliers include Guinea in Africa, about 16.3m tonnes;
Jamaica, 11m tonnes; and Brazil 10.3m tonnes. Jamaica also features among
the foremost alumina producers, with annual capacity of 3.5m tonnes, not far
short of the 5m tonnes in North America. (It requires about two tonnes of
bauxite to produce one tonne of alumina and about two tonnes of alumina to
produce one tonne of aluminium).
Most bauxite and alumina is sold via long-term contracts but the spot market
price, which peaked at USDollars 700 a tonne in 1988, averaged between
Dollars 180 and Dollars 200 last year and is now down at Dollars 140.
Mr Armstrong said that CRU's latest report* showed that demand from the
Commonwealth of Independent States had helped buoy up international bauxite
and alumina prices in the past two years at a time when aluminium prices
crashed to all-time lows because of an unexpected surge in exports from the
former Soviet Union.
Now the alumina refiners were feeling the full impact of aluminium output
cuts announced by western producers last year.

FT  18 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Base metals prices extend rally
 -Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Base metals prices continued last week's rally at the London Metal Exchange
yesterday before settling back under pressure from profit-taking.
As speculative activity remained predominant the three months COPPER price
hit a four-month high of Dollars 1,860 a tonne at one point and finished at
Dollars 1,845, still up Dollars 19 from Friday's kerb close.
In the ALUMINIUM market traders jockeyed for position ahead of today's
crucial multilateral talks in Brussels on curbing the present glut. The
three months price hit a 5 1/2 -month high of Dollars 1,231 a tonne as talk
circulated that other producers might follow the output cut announced by
Alcan of Canada last Thursday. But the price sagged to end the kerb session
at Dollars 1,215.50 a tonne, up Dollars 10.50 from Friday.
Among the other metals NICKEL prices hit 8 1/2 -month highs but failed to
break resistance at Dollars 6,000 a tonne and the LEAD market proved unable
to extend its gains beyond the 14 1/2 -month highs seen in the morning. ZINC
absorbed a bout of profit-taking to finish Dollars 8 up at Dollars 1,033 a
tonne in the three months position.
At the London bullion market SILVER continued to set the pace with an early
rise to a 5-month high of 534 cents a troy ounce. It edged back to close 13
cents up on balance at 531.5 cents.
London's cocoa and coffee futures markets both ended the day quietly firm,
but traders said the limited interest meant prices remained within existing
ranges. At the London Commodity Exchange the May COCOA position closed at
Pounds 937 a tonne, up Pounds 7, while March COFFEE gained Dollars 10 at
1,199 a tonne.
Traders said continuing concern over Ivory Coast shipments was underpinning
the cocoa market but noted that the marketing board and shippers were
expected to meet this week to sort out problems resulting from last week's
devaluation of the CFA franc.
Coffee's rise lacked any real momentum, traders said, and light Far East
producer selling was again capping the March price at around Dollars 1,200 a
tonne, the top end of its recent range. 'I can't see it breaking through
just yet,' one said.

FT  18 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indian tea industry believes
record crop gathered in 1993
</HEADLINE>

Industry estimates put India's 1993 tea output at an all-time high of over
750m kg, compared with 703.9m in 1992, when all major tea growing countries
suffered major setbacks.
Aided by favourable weather in every production centre, India, according to
the country's Tea Board, had harvested a crop of 715m kg by the end of
November, up 49m kg over the corresponding period of the previous year.
'Since the weather in December was quite good, the production last month
must have been more than 40m kg. Generally, India produces around 40m kg of
tea in December,' said Mr HM Parekh, chairman of J. Thomas, India's biggest
tea broking firm.
Mr HP Barooah, chairman of Indian Tea Association, agreed with the
production estimate. While the two south Indian states of Tamil Nadu and
Kerala had made a significant contribution to the improvement in production,
Assam and West Bengal in the north had recorded handsome gains. 'Not only
had India produced a record quantity of tea, but there also had been an
improvement in the quality of tea grown in the north Indian gardens. It is
time the south Indian tea estates gave attention to the quality aspect,'
said Mr Parekh.
Almost the extra production in 1993 had been in the form of CTC (cut, tear
and curl) tea, for which demand is growing steadily both within and outside
the country.
Despite the marked improvement in production, said Mr Parekh, the industry
realised much better prices for all kinds of teas last year. At the Calcutta
auction, CTC tea fetched an average price of Rs52.54 (Pounds 1.12) a
kilogram, up from Rs41.83 in 1992. At Rs55.76 a kilogram, orthodox tea was
dearer by Rs12.73. The Darjeeling tea price rose by nearly Rs17 to Rs94.52 a
kilogram.
As a result, the majority of tea companies earned handsome profits during
1993. According to industry officials, the strong rise in domestic demand,
particularly for quality tea, and the improvement in exports contributed to
the rise in auction prices.
'We think, India's tea export last year rose to about 200m kg from 173m kg.
This happened as the Commonwealth of Independent States stepped up its
purchase by 30m kg to 80m kg. But less Indian tea had been shipped to the
UK,' said Mr Parekh. While the export of tea to Poland had been maintained
at 14.5m kg, shipments to Egypt and Iran had declined. The United Arab
Emirates, however, had bought more.
It is too early for the industry officials to make any forecast for the
current year's tea crop as plucking in north India does not get fully into
gear until March. They are, however, worried that north India had not
received any rains since October. 'North India must receive a few showers
now for the March tea production to be good,' they said.

There was improved demand for landed, with emphasis on better liquoring

particularly pd's, but prices were 2 to 6p easier with quality, while plain
sorts were again neglected. Bright and good medium east Africans often
gained several pence but plainer descriptions were irregular and barely
steady. Ceylons met good but selective demand with better sorts firm and
lower quality teas tending easier. Offshore: good general demand. Brighter

FT  18 JAN 94 / Government Bonds: Gilts end stronger as traders digest price
data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE and TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK government bonds dipped yesterday on the release of higher-than-expected
producer price data for December, but quickly bounced back when it became
clear the underlying trend was lower year-on-year. They ended the day about
a  1/4 point higher, with an equal performance along the yield curve.
'The market was reassured by the numbers since they showed that price
inflation is still falling,' said Mr Simon Briscoe at S. G. Warburg. He said
the figures provided a favourable background for the retail prices index,
which will be published tomorrow.
The Bank of England is due to announce details of its gilts auction this
afternoon. The market widely expects the Bank to opt for a 2010 maturity, in
the middle of its 2008-2012 range, thereby establishing a new 15-year
benchmark. Analysts expect the auction to raise between Pounds 3bn and
Pounds 3.5bn, with a yield on the stock of around 6 1/2 per cent.
German government bonds eased in quiet trading as investors retreated to the
sidelines ahead of the Bundesbank's fortnightly council meeting on Thursday.
The holiday in the US also dampened activity. The March bund future on Liffe
fell 0.12 point to 100.53 in moderate volume.
Analysts said the recent fall in the D-Mark against the dollar had reduced
the chances of a cut in German interest rates this week. There was also
little evidence of a slowing in M3 growth. 'The Bundesbank has to have
something on which to hang the rate cut,' said Mr Richard Reid, chief
economist at UBS in Frankfurt.
However, the release of preliminary cost of living data for January later
this week could provide the market with a fresh direction, he added.
Italian government bonds gained  1/4 point, bucking the downward trend
elsewhere in continental Europe, as the market took comfort from the fact
that Mr Carlo Ciampi will stay on as caretaker prime minister in the run-up
to elections, called for March 27.
Without this, there could have been a 'political vacuum which would have
prompted a big sell-off', said Mr Andrew Roberts, a bond analyst at UBS in
London.
However, he warned the market was likely to become more volatile in the
run-up to the elections, particularly if some of Italy's more marginal
political parties start to make a strong showing in opinion polls. Although
the market currently takes the view that crucial economic reforms are
already in place, the economic policies of some of the smaller parties
remain unclear.
Mr Roberts is recommending that clients switch from Italy to Spain, although
he says the outlook for Italy remains favourable in the longer term.
Japanese government bonds and futures remained weak due to supply concerns
in the market following the Trust Fund Bureau's announcement that it intends
to sell Y900bn of its 10-year bond holdings over the next three months.
Fears that the government's fiscal package might be larger than expected,
and that there will be no early easing in the discount rate, also depressed
the market, said Mr Nigel Richardson, head of bond research at Yamaichi
International in London.
The yield on the benchmark No 157 bond rose to 3.27 per cent yesterday from
3.16 per cent on Friday. Bond analysts noted the yield was below 3 per cent
only one week ago. The March contract closed at 116.20 in Tokyo, down from
116.90 on Friday, and slipped further to 115.67 in London trading.
Mr David Knee, economist at Daiwa Europe, said there was not a great deal of
selling in the cash market, since investors were opting to hedge their
positions rather than sell their cash holdings.
US bond markets were closed yesterday.

encouraged by strong economic growth prospects and relatively high yields,
according to a survey published yesterday by Euromoney Publications*.
While Mexico, Chile and Argentina are considered among the most developed of
the emerging Latin American markets, the smaller markets of Uruguay, Panama,
Costa Rica and Bolivia are expected to attract increasing attention over the
next five years.
Some investors, though, voiced concerns over logistics, noting problems with
executing trades and with diversification. 'Overall, investors seemed most
concerned about the poor execution capacity of Latin American equity markets
and the relatively weak price-to-book values/ratios.
'Economic and political risk, historically the main obstacles to investment
in Latin America, were seen as less of a worry than the lack of liquidity
and adequate diversification,' the report says.
The survey is based on questionnaires sent to more than 110 international
investors around the world, who were selected on the basis that more than 5
per cent of funds under management were invested in Latin America.
Overall, survey participants invested 23.24 per cent of their funds in Latin
America in mid-1993, and expect their total exposure to be 23.97 per cent by
mid-1995, representing an increase of 3 per cent.
Mexico is likely to maintain its position as the main recipient of foreign
capital. However, its overall share is likely to decline as part of a
general move away from the developed, highly-capitalised markets towards
growing, under-capitalised markets such as Colombia and Brazil.
Currently over 80 per cent of investment in Latin America is in the form of
either debt or equity, with debt instruments accounting for 43.05 per cent
and equity 42.10 per cent.
Investors expect this emphasis to change, predicting that equities will be
46.68 per cent of total investment in Latin America, against 39.62 per cent
for debt by mid-1995.
'This movement is a reflection of the developments of the two markets. For,
while the yield spread between Latin debt and US Treasuries has gradually
tightened, return on equity investments has often increased,' the report
says.
'In addition, with equity widely perceived as more risky than debt, the
switch to equities can be seen as a sign of increased investor confidence in
the region's growing economic stability.'
Investors described Mexico as the most attractive Latin American country for
equity investment, awarding it high marks for company quality, research and
liquidity, while Peru was seen as the least attractive.

FT  18 JAN 94 / International Bonds: Dixons leads slow day with Dollars 100m
offering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With US markets closed, the Eurobond market caught its breath after last
week's record-breaking flood of supply, and saw only a handful of new
issues.
Dixons Group, the UK consumer electronics and domestic appliances retailer,
was the first UK non-financial corporate borrower to tap the Euro sterling
sector in months, raising Dollars 100m of 10-year bonds via Samuel Montagu.
The bonds, priced to yield 140 basis points over gilts at the re-offer price
of 99.30, ended the day at 99.40 bid, yielding some 137 basis points over
gilts. Most of the paper had been pre-placed by the lead manager last week,
ensuring the issue went smoothly.
The dollar floating-rate note (FRN) sector saw Dollars 100m of five-year
notes for the Cassa di Risparmio di Verona and Dollars 75m two-year notes
for Commerzbank International.
The Cassa di Risparmio deal was reported to have met with healthy demand,
especially from banks, which like to hold floating-rate assets to match
their liabilities.
The Commerzbank floater, structured so that interest only accrues when Libor
falls within a specific range at certain times, was harder to place, partly
because the borrower was Commerzbank's Luxembourg subsidiary, one trader
said.
Alcatel Alsthom, the French-based engineering, transport and
telecommunications group, issued FFr2bn of 10-year bonds via Societe
Generale.
Despite a profit warning from the company's chairman which caused its share
price to slide by 12 per cent last week, the deal met with demand from a
broad range of European investors.
The bonds were priced to yield 36 basis points over the benchmark 10-year
OAT, and while the price came off in line with the underlying bond market,
the spread remained constant.
Meanwhile, market participants are gearing up for another raft of large
issues in coming weeks.
On Friday, Mexico's Banco Nacional de Comercio Exterior (Bancomext) is
expected to issue a Dollars 1bn global bond via Goldman Sachs and Merrill
Lynch. Market talk indicates a yield spread over US Treasuries of some
150-165 basis points. A roadshow for the issuer will be held in London
today.
China is expected to launch a Dollars 1bn issue of 10-year global bonds via
Merrill Lynch, following a series of investor presentations due to start
tomorrow in Hong Kong.
Rumours of a Dollars 1.5bn FRN for the Canadian Province of Ontario remained
on the boil, while Lloyds Bank was said to have postponed its planned Pounds
300m 25-year sterling bond after the details of the deal had been widely
leaked in the market.
Elsewhere, Swedish Export Credit is said to be planning the first Swedish
krone global bond, with Merrill Lynch tipped as lead manager for the
SKr2.0bn deal.

Malta Freeport Corporation (MFC) is to raise up to Dollars 250m in
international capital markets to finance the development of a new container
terminal. The financing will be guaranteed by the Republic of Malta.
The government and MFC hope to get the debt rated by Moody's and Standard
and Poor's, the US credit rating agencies. A Maltese issuer has never before
sought a rating outside Malta.
MFC has engaged Bankers Trust to arrange the financing. It hopes to conclude
the deal before the end of June.
The new terminal will handle 500,000 containers. This will double the
overall capacity of the free port zone, situated on the island's south
coast.
The terminal shipped 288,000 containers in 1993 and predicts a further rise
to 400,000 this year.

FT  18 JAN 94 / International Company News: Sunkyong seeks to take control
of Korean Mobile Telecom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON

<DATELINE>
   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sunkyong, South Korea's fifth-largest conglomerate, is to drop out of a
proposed consortium to operate the country's second cellular telephone
network and hopes instead to become the main shareholder in Korean Mobile
Telecom.
Forty-four per cent of KMT, the only existing cellular telephone operator,
will be sold by auction next week by Korean Telecom, the state-supported
telecommunications agency, as part of a privatisation programme.
Sunkyong won the licence to operate the second mobile telephone project in
1992, but was forced to give it up after allegations of nepotism under the
previous government of President Roh Tae-woo.
Allegations of official favouritism have continued; last December the
government appointed the Federation of Korean Industries, the country's main
business organisation whose head is Sunkyong chairman, Mr Chey Jong-hyon, to
form a consortium for the new mobile telecom network by the end of February.
Mr Chey said Sunkyong was abandoning the second mobile telecom project to
remove suspicions about the biased selection of its partners.
Analysts estimate that Sunkyong will have to spend Won300bn (Dollars 369m)
to gain a controlling stake in KMT, which is one of the favourite Korean
stocks among foreign investors. It has been trading with a premium as high
as 95 per cent among foreign investors on the over-the-counter market after
its 10 per cent foreign shareholding limit was filled in 1992.
The high premium reflects the growth potential for the cellular telephone
market in Korea, which has seen an annual doubling in subscribers during the
past few years.
Sunkyong's decision to bid for KMT will affect the strategy of other Korean
companies wanting to enter the mobile telephone market. Pohang Iron and
Steel, the country's leading steelmaker, and Kolon, a textile group, were
also expected to bid for control of KMT.

FT  18 JAN 94 / International Company News: Alcan blames glut for losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GIBBENS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MONTREAL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Alcan Aluminium, one of the world's biggest aluminium producers, blamed the
world aluminium glut for a fourth-quarter loss of USDollars 36m, or 17 cents
a share, including a rationalisation charge of USDollars 25m.
This compared with a Dollars 56m loss equal to 29 cents a share in the 1992
quarter, including Dollars 49m of special charges. Revenues in the latest
quarter were Dollars 1.8bn, down slightly.
Alcan's loss for all 1993 was Dollars 104m, or 54 cents a share, against a
loss of Dollars 112m, or 60 cents. Special charges were Dollars 37m against
Dollars 58m. Revenues were down slightly at Dollars 7.23bn.
Mr Jacques Bougie, president, blamed massive CIS exports for creating the
overcapacity crisis. LME spot ingot prices touched a new low (after
inflation) of 46 US cents per pound in December. The price has since risen
to 54.5 US cents yesterday on hopes of an international agreement on global
production cutbacks.
Alcan last week decided to close temporarily another 156,000 tonnes of ingot
capacity in north America, Brazil and Britain.
Fabricated product volumes hit new highs in the fourth quarter and 1993, but
prices fell through the year. Ingot shipments were lower in the fourth
quarter but higher for the year, but prices weakened.
But Alcan's operating results benefited from cost reductions and lower
interest costs. The year-to-year losses were reduced in Canada, Latin
America and the Pacific area, but were higher in the US, Europe and
elsewhere.

in final quarter

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Fourth-quarter profits at Union Carbide were comfortably ahead of market
expectations, thanks to falling debt and the effects of cost-cutting, the US
chemicals group said.
Although its full results will not be released until the middle of next
week, the company said earnings per share for the period would be about 25
cents, higher than most market estimates. It earned 23 cents a share in the
previous three months, and 12 cents a share in the fourth quarter of 1992.
Union Carbide said margins for some of its major products were lower than a
year earlier, reflecting the continuing overcapacity in the chemicals
industry. However, earnings were higher due to lower fixed costs and
interest expense.
The company has been pushing through a cost reduction programme designed to
save around Dollars 400m a year, and had previously projected interest costs
last year of around Dollars 75m, down from Dollars 140m in 1991.

FT  18 JAN 94 / International Company News: Ontario Hydro to write off
CDollars 3bn to cover shake-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ontario Hydro, North America's biggest power utility, has decided to swallow
several doses of bitter medicine in one gulp with write-offs totalling
between CDollars 2.9bn and CDollars 3.5bn (Dollars 2.63bn) to be charged
against 1993 income.
The write-offs are part of a top-to-bottom shake-up which was put in motion
a year ago after the appointment of Mr Maurice Strong, former
secretary-general of the United Nations Environment Programme, as chairman.
Mr Strong has cut a swathe through the government-owned utility with the aim
of transforming it from a bureaucratic, financially-stretched organisation
into an operation run along business lines.
Ms Eleanor Clitheroe, chief financial officer, said the charges give the
utility 'a clean slate to proceed with its debt reduction programme'. The
aim is to reduce Hydro's heavy debt burden, currently about CDollars 35bn,
by at least one-third over the next decade.
The write-offs announced yesterday are roughly double the figure projected
six months ago. They include the cost of cancelling long-term uranium
contracts negotiated with Denison Mines and Rio Algom at prices far above
present market levels, and a write-off of surplus generating capacity.
Details of the capacity write-downs have yet to be determined.
Ms Clitheroe said that by taking the write-offs in one lump, Hydro will
boost its 1994 income from CDollars 250m to CDollars 600m. Thanks to lower
costs and improved operating performance, it now estimates that its
operations virtually broke even last year, compared with earlier forecasts
of a CDollars 200m operating loss.
Hydro's problems came to a head after growing resistance from its customers
to steep electricity price rises, which averaged 7.3 per cent a year between
1988 and 1992. Mr Strong has promised to freeze power rates this year.

FT  18 JAN 94 / International Company News: Chrysler boosts Jeep production
in Beijing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Beijing Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Beijing Jeep, Chrysler's Chinese joint venture, plans to more than double
production to an annual 200,000 Jeeps by early next century.
Present production of the Jeep Cherokee off-road vehicle and military-style
Jeep is about 80,000 units annually. The Sino-US venture will spend Yn2.1bn
(Dollars 241m) over the next five years to upgrade Beijing's plant to meet
international competition.
Chrysler owns 42 per cent of the Beijing venture. It plans to build 20,000
Jeep Cherokees and 50,000 traditional semi-military Beijing Jeeps in 1994.
Sales of the Jeep Cherokee fell below its 35,000 target last year with only
20,000 sold, largely due to a government-imposed credit squeeze.
'A production target doesn't mean much to me,' said Mr Fu Deru, the plant's
spokesman. 'The most important question is how many units can you sell.
We've already acquired a production capacity that could churn out more than
the market could consume.'
In the past decade Beijing Jeep has produced 354,000 jeeps including 70,000
Cherokees, earning Yn1.07bn in profits. Sixty per cent of Cherokee
components are now made in China.
China recently lowered its vehicle import tariff from 220 per cent to 150
per cent and lifted controls on car purchases. The move is expected to
enliven China's car market, which has been severely restricted with little
opportunity for private ownership.
China has so far allowed eight foreign vehicle companies to set up joint
venture plants, with Germany's 50 per cent-owned Volkswagen Shanghai venture
the largest. Other producers are lobbying the Chinese government to enter
the quickly expanding China car market.
China produced 1.18m motor vehicles last year, and sales reached 1.17m. The
plan for 1994 is 1.3m; Chinese officials say they want to keep the vehicle
growth rate at 10 per cent a year.

FT  18 JAN 94 / International Company News: French new towns plan bond issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Nine of France's post-war 'new towns' plan to join forces and issue FFr2-3bn
worth of bonds later this year to refinance high-cost bank debt.
The move would mark the first real entry into the international capital
markets for the new towns, set up in the last 20 years chiefly around Paris
but also near Lyon, Marseilles and Lille.
Mr Jacques Guyard, mayor of Evry and president of the Association of Leaders
of the New Towns, said yesterday that in addition to the bond issues, the
new municipalities wanted to diversify their annual borrowing of FFr8-900m
in order to get better rates.
Some German savings banks had already shown interest in lending to France's
new towns, and Mr Guyard hoped that other foreign institutions would follow.
Over the past 15 years, the new towns have amassed debt of FFr11bn (Dollars
1.88bn), which costs on average one-third of their annual budgets.
The newly-privatised Credit Local de France has virtually been the monopoly
lender to the new towns.
Mr Guyard said that to attract international investors and lenders, 'we
might form ourselves into a mutual organisation, or perhaps we might sign
separate contracts negotiated together'.

FT  18 JAN 94 / International Company News: China to raise more capital in
West
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China is set for aggressive capital raising in Western markets following its
registration with the US Securities Exchange Commission to issue some
Dollars 1bn in global bonds.
Merrill Lynch, in association with major securities houses and banks, will
market the dollar-denominated notes to be issued by China's Ministry of
Finance to help finance the country's vast infrastructure requirements.
The global bonds will mark the Chinese government's first entry to the US
market since the Communist revolution, although a state-owned corporation
issued Dollars 250m worth of paper to US buyers last July.
China's demand for capital to finance its modernisation drive is almost
insatiable, and a successful global bond issue is certain to be followed by
further forays into world markets.
The country's ability to sell debt securities was recently enhanced by an
upgrading of its credit rating. In September Moody's raised its debt rating
to A3 from Baa1, while Standard &amp; Poor's rate China's outstanding debt
triple-B.
China's Ministry of Finance last October tapped the 'dragon bond' market in
Hong Kong, issuing Dollars 300m of 10-year bonds, targetted mainly at Asian
institutional investors. Earlier the ministry issued Y30bn (Dollars 3bn) of
five-year Eurobonds.
The China International Trust and Investment Corporation (CITIC) showed the
way for Chinese institutions seeking to raise capital in the US. Its Dollars
250m issue of 10-year bonds, launched last year, met strong demand.
The forthcoming global bond is expected to receive a warm welcome,
especially from Asian investors, but also from the US and Europe, where
yield-hungry investors are keen to buy liquid bonds offering a substantial
yield pick-up.
China's dragon bond was launched at an 88-basis-point spread over US
Treasuries, and given the liquidity of the forthcoming global bond, some
market participants say the deal could offer a slightly tighter spread.
The dragon bond widened slightly to 86 basis points on the bid price
yesterday as word over the China global bond spread through the market.

Pacific BBA, the plastics and automotive supplies group which became
Australian-owned after the UK-based BBA Group sold its 57 per cent interest
last year, is buying a minority stake in Dynaplast, an Indonesian plastics
company, as part of a plan to move into the Indonesian market, writes Nikki
Tait.
BBA said it had been working with Dynaplast, which is listed on the Jakarta
stock exchange, for the past 18 months, and plans had been agreed for the
introduction of BBA products into that area. BBA said its position as a
shareholder in Dynaplast 'confirms ongoing support and the availability of .
. . technology for Dynaplast'. BBA is paying about ADollars 6m (USDollars
4m) for an 8.1 per cent interest.

<TEXT>
Highlands Gold, the Papua New Guinea-based mining company in which
Australia's MIM Holdings holds a majority stake, yesterday reported a 44.8
per cent fall in earnings in the six months to December 12, to K12.1m
(USDollars 12.3m), writes Nikki Tait. Sales revenue was down to K53.5m from
K71.4m.
Results in the second quarter comprised a net profit of K4.6m compared with
just over K9m in the same period of 1992.
The figures reflect Highlands' reduction in interest in the Porgera gold
mine, to 25 per cent from 30 per cent. Highlands' share of production from
the Porgera mine provided sales of 144,417 ounces of gold at an average
realised price of USDollars 363 per ounce during the six-month period
(compared with 194,500 ounces at USDollars 363 in the same period of 1992).
The total contribution from Porgera to group sales was K51.6m.

FT  18 JAN 94 / International Company News: AMP lifts income to ADollars 8bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Australian Mutual Provident Society, one of Australia's largest
institutions and owner of the Pearl and London Life, UK life offices, said
yesterday premium income increased by only a small amount in 1993, to about
ADollars 8bn (USDollars 5.3m). However, this masks a 4 per cent fall in
premiums and new savings in Australia, to about ADollars 3.8bn, while the
two UK life offices saw a 10 per cent increase, to ADollars 3.2bn. Premiums
and new savings income from New Zealand-based operations declined, by 8 per
cent to ADollars 602m, writes Nikki Tait.
The AMP, which will not release full results for 1993 until April, said the
declines in Australia and New Zealand reflected 'the impact of the recession
on consumers who were less willing to enter into long-term financial
commitments'. The institution, which has seen its once-commanding position
in the Australian fund management business come under competitive attack,
added that annual operating costs had been cut by about ADollars 200m, and
were 'moving steadily towards becoming a broader-based worldwide insurance
and saving organisation'.

Aztec Mining Company, the Australian mining house facing an unwanted

Investments, yesterday said record gold output of almost 40,000 ounces was
achieved by its Bounty Gold Mine in Western Australia in the three months
ended December 25, a 32 per cent increase over the previous quarter, writes
Nikki Tait in Sydney.
The company said the increased production contributed to a 28 per cent
reduction in operating cost per ounce of gold compared with the previous
quarter. It reported that its Woodcutters Zinc Mine yielded 22,268 tonnes of
zinc and lead concentrates but would be 'well-positioned to double
production in the event of sustained metal price increases'.

FT  18 JAN 94 / International Company News: Sunkyong seeks control of Korean
Mobile Telecom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON

<DATELINE>
   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sunkyong, South Korea's fifth-largest conglomerate, is to drop out of a
proposed consortium to operate the country's second cellular telephone
network and hopes instead to become the main shareholder in Korean Mobile
Telecom (KMT).
Forty-four per cent of KMT, the only existing cellular telephone operator,
will be sold by auction next week by Korean Telecom, the state-supported
telecommunications agency, as part of a privatisation programme.
Sunkyong won the licence to operate the second mobile telephone project in
1992, but was forced to give it up after allegations of nepotism under the
previous government of President Roh Tae-woo.
Allegations of official favouritism have continued; last December the
government appointed the Federation of Korean Industries, the country's main
business organisation whose head is Sunkyong chairman, Mr Chey Jong-hyon, to
form a consortium for the new mobile telecom network by the end of February.
Mr Chey said Sunkyong was abandoning the second mobile telecom project to
remove suspicions about the biased selection of its partners.
Analysts estimate that Sunkyong will have to spend Won300bn (Dollars 369m)
to gain a controlling stake in KMT, which is one of the favourite Korean
stocks among foreign investors. It has been trading with a premium as high
as 95 per cent among foreign investors on the over-the-counter market after
its 10 per cent foreign shareholding limit was filled in 1992.
The high premium reflects the growth potential for the cellular telephone
market in Korea, which has seen an annual doubling in subscribers during the
last few years.
Sunkyong's decision to bid for KMT will affect the strategy of other Korean
companies wanting to enter the mobile telephone market. Pohang Iron and
Steel, the country's leading steelmaker, and Kolon, a textile group, were
also expected to bid for control of KMT.
But analysts believe the departure of Sunkyong from the second mobile
telecom project will persuade them to take over that network instead, and
avoid a costly bidding war for KMT. Both companies competed against Sunkyong
for the second cellular network contract in 1992.
KMT is the second state-owned telecommunications company to be privatised
recently. In November Korea Telecom sold its controlling interest in Dacom,
its only competitor in international telecommunications services, to the
Tongyang group.

FT  18 JAN 94 / International Company News: Investcorp posts profits up 7%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Investcorp, the Bahrain-based international merchant bank, which last year
took over Gucci, the luxury goods company, yesterday announced a 7.3 per
cent increase in full-year post-tax profits to Dollars 67.3m, after making
six acquisitions during 1993.
Investcorp was established 11 years ago by 335 founding shareholders from
Arab countries. It was intended as a vehicle to channel private wealth from
the region into established businesses in developed countries.
The bank continued its tradition of making an annual cash dividend payment
of Pounds 15m to shareholders. This has been held constant since its
foundation at 15 per cent of the Dollars 100m capital paid in by founding
shareholders.
Among the bank's deals in the US during the year were the acquisition of
Camelot Music, for which it is thought to have paid more than Dollars 350m,
and Circle K, the fourth-largest chain of convenience stores.
In Europe, it arranged the acquisition of Thorn Lighting from Thorn EMI for
Pounds 162m (Dollars 239.8m). It also paid Dollars 170m to raise its stake
and those of its clients in Gucci from 50 per cent to complete ownership.
Mr Elia Hallack, co-chief operating officer, said that the bank's capital
investment activities had an exceptional year because two of six large deals
had been started in 1992. But he believed there was strong potential this
year.
He said that trading activities had been 'disappointing'. However, the bank
intended to continue developing them.

Rubbermaid, the Ohio-based plastic and rubber consumer products group,
yesterday signed a joint venture agreement with Richell, a privately-owned
Toyama-based company and one of Japan's leading manufacturers of household
products.
Richell will put its home and leisure products division, with a Dollars 60m
turover, into the venture, leaving the parent to run a garden business.
Rubbermaid will initially hold 40 per cent, with the option of lifting its
stake to 51 per cent by the year-end. Mr Lawrence Blackburn, vice-president
of the international household products division, said such a move was
highly likely.
Rubbermaid's acquisition is part of a strategy to increase overseas sales
from its present 15 per cent of turnover to 25 per cent by the end of the
decade. As part of this strategy, the company formed a joint venture in 1990
with DSM of the Netherlands, and Mr Blackburn said it was looking to expand
in the Pacific rim and Latin America.

FT  18 JAN 94 / International Company News: Bank of Montreal lifts payout
for quarter

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Bank of Montreal, one of Canada's top three banks, has raised its quarterly
dividend, reflecting its own strong performance and the favourable outlook
for Canada's big six banks as a group.
Then bank yesterday said its dividend will climb to 30 cents a share from 28
cents. The higher dividend will be payable on February 25 to shareholders
registered by February 8. Earlier, Bank of Nova Scotia lifted its quarterly
payout from 29 to 30 cents.
Bank shares have climbed steeply on the Toronto stock exchange in recent
months in anticipation of stronger lending volumes and declining loan
losses. Shares of Bank of Nova Scotia, which posted the highest return on
equity among the six banks last year, were trading at CDollars 32.38
yesterday, up from last year's low of CDollars 21.88.
Bank of Montreal has posted record earnings for the past four years. Mr
Matthew Barrett, chairman, told the annual meeting yesterday that BMO aimed
to be the first bank providing a full range of services across both the US
and Canada.
Mr Barrett warned that unless Canadian banks were willing to compete head-on
with US banks south of the border, they should resign themselves to being
regional banks, 'and perhaps not even independent regional banks'.
Canadian banks 'sooner or later can expect to face much more intense
competition from American banks right here in Canada', Mr Barrett said. 'We
intend to engage the US competition on their own ground long before they
cast their eyes northward.'
The bank has said it plans to invest CDollars 1bn (USDollars 700m) in a bid
to triple the market share of Harris Bankcorp, its Chicago-based subsidiary.
Mr Barrett said that Harris was now worth USDollars 2bn, nearly four times
the acquisition price in 1984.
He said the bank would also strengthen its presence in Mexico and rapidly
expand its seven-branch network in south-east Asia. Harris and the bank's
Canadian securities unit Nesbit Thomson together would form a continental
investment bank, he said.

FT  18 JAN 94 / International Company News: Battle joined for Brazil's
telecom market - AT&amp;T's attempt to break into the supply monopoly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK MCCURRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT&amp;T, the US telecommunications group, is attempting to fight its way into
Brazil's traditionally protectionist equipment supply market but it is
meeting fierce opposition from the local operations of its rivals NEC,
Ericsson and Siemens.
They maintain that AT&amp;T's move is a 'predatory invasion' and are putting up
stiff resistance to the US group's entry.
The struggle is regarded as a microcosm of the debate on breaking the
country's telecommunications monopoly. The case has provoked controversy,
partly because under past military regimes telecommunications was one of
Brazil's most sensitive areas and the government insisted on protecting
locally based technology.
The dispute centres on a contract for 55 switching centres, capable of
providing 720,000 new telephone lines, offered for tender by Telebras, the
state-controlled telecom company, last November.
A surprise last-minute bid from AT&amp;T Network Systems do Brasil, a joint
venture between AT&amp;T and a local company, sparked official complaints and
legal action from NEC do Brasil, Ericsson Telecomunicacoes and Equitel, a
Siemens-linked company, prompting President Itamar Franco to suspend the
tender. AT&amp;T's bid is thought to be substantially lower than the three
locally based companies.
Brazil's telecom equipment market is worth about Dollars 2bn a year but,
with a backlog of 10m lines due to under investment by Telebras, it could
reach Dollars 5bn-Dollars 7bn by the end of the decade.
'This is just too big a market for us to give up. They might succeed in
blocking us temporarily but we're not going away,' says Mr Antonio Carlos
Gil, president of AT&amp;T Networks Systems do Brasil.
According to Mr Sergio Goldman, research director at brokerage house Baring
Securities Brasil, Telebras spends Dollars 3,000 in capital investment for
each line installed, compared with Dollars 2,000 in Mexico and Dollars 1,000
in Chile. At least some of that difference is due to higher equipment costs,
he says.
'Increasing competition in equipment supply will lower costs but some of the
companies are unwilling to accept this competition and unfortunately they
are influencing the government,' says Mr Goldman.
Telebras's estimated capital spending of Dollars 3.2bn last year is regarded
as half of what needs to be spent if demand is to be met and Brazil's very
low ratio of 7.4 phone lines per 100 inhabitants, less than Mexico and
Argentina, significantly expanded.
Locally based companies argue that they invested in Brazilian production in
return for a protected market. This system was abolished by former President
Fernando Collor in 1990, and they now find themselves threatened by cheaper
imports.
Mr Verner Dittmer, president of Equitel, accepts that Brazil cannot ignore
the world trend towards opening markets: 'I'm in favour of competition but
the opening must be gradual. Even in the US there is protection for local
industry against predatory invasion.'
Mr Gilberto Garbi, president of NEC do Brasil, says other foreign companies,
such as Alcatel of France, have entered the market since the abolition of
the market reserve but have done so by establishing a local manufacturing
base. 'The problem with AT&amp;T is the way it wants to come in, just importing
and not contributing to local jobs,' he says.
The local companies have threatened to shut down their Brazilian plants and
import if AT&amp;T gets the contract.
Mr Gil of AT&amp;T Network Systems says the company intends to assemble imported
components at its plant in the free-trade zone of Manaus and later
manufacture electronic boards there. But he stresses that production will
take place 'where it is best for our business plan'.
In a move apparently supporting the locally based companies and critical of
Telebras, President Franco suspended the bid indefinitely on December 8,
calling for a full investigation of AT&amp;T's Network Systems' bid paperwork.
He said the tender would be cancelled if any irregularity were discovered by
the Telebras inquiry.
Shortly afterwards the government issued ordinances offering substantial tax
incentives for locally made telecom equipment.
For switching centres, local content must be 85 per cent in 1994 to qualify
for the fiscal benefits, while AT&amp;T's equipment is initially expected to
contain 35 per cent local content. The industry and commerce minister
defended the measures, arguing that locally based companies needed more time
to adapt to international competition.
Mr Gil says AT&amp;T Network Systems is studying 'a number of options' in
response to the measures, including speeding up its investment plans and
possibly moving its production from Manaus to Curitiba in the south east of
Brazil.
The new measures will not affect the current contract unless the bid is
cancelled and re-tendered, but Mr Garbi of NEC believes it is '99 per cent
likely' that the government will cancel the bid and hold it again under the
new rules.
Even if AT&amp;T loses this battle, in the longer term the market seems likely
to be opened.
Finance minister Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso's proposals to amend the
constitution and allow some kind of privatisation of Telebras's local
service monopoly to be discussed in the pending constitutional review point
to more competition.
According to Mr Goldman, the current Telebras row provided another good
reason for privatisation 'because a privatised company would not have the
same political pressures and would buy from whoever it wanted'.

desk-top range

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Hewlett-Packard, which last year overtook Digital Equipment to become the
second-largest US computer company behind IBM, will today launch two product
lines to expand in the corporate computing market.
HP will announce an enterprise desktop computer combining the high
performance of a scientific workstation with the lower cost and software
standards of personal computers. The company will introduce a line of
network servers, priced to compete with PC servers but offering performance
that competes with mini-computers.
The new computers, based on a low-cost version of HP's PA-Risc
microprocessor chip, are aggressively priced. The desktop machines, which
start at Dollars 3,995, will compete with high-end PCs. The new HP servers,
which range in price from Dollars 7,569 to Dollars 14,919, outperform PC
servers while undercutting the price of mini-computers, such as the IBM
AS/400.
HP's new computers are aimed at companies adopting the client server
networked computing model.
'These are the machines needed by companies that are re-engineering their
businesses,' says Mr Willem Roelants, general manager of HP's computer
systems operations. 'The fundamental idea of re-engineering is to give
employees tools so that one person can complete a job, such as a customer
transaction, without having to pass it on to several different people in
different departments.'
Sales of enterprise workstations are rising sharply according to a market
report issued last week by Frost and Sullivan, the US market research group.
World sales were expected to reach Dollars 25bn per year by 1999, the
researchers predicted.
HP's challenge in the enterprise workstation market is to displace high-end
PCs. To do so, it will offer software compatibility with programs designed
for the Microsoft Windows environment as well as UNIX applications. HP will
introduce multi-media programs for video and voice applications.
HP has designed its new desktop and server computers so that they can run
Microsoft's new Windows NT operating system.
Lotus Development, Applix and Clarity have developed programs for the new HP
desktop machines.
The new HP desktop computers will run standard PC programs and UNIX
application programs.

Local private broadcasters have strengthened their chances of winning
Poland's first national commercial television licence after three days of
public hearings which ended yesterday.
The companies are competing in Warsaw for the 10-year licence against
multinationals such as the Bertelsmann group of Germany, Compagnie
Luxembourgeoise de Telediffusion (CLT) and Time Warner of the US, which have
put in bids with local partners.
The tone of the local applications contrasted with the bid from Bertelsmann,
which has offered to invest Dollars 200m and makes little secret of the fact
that it intends to control the venture.
Time Warner, Capital Cities-ABC and CNN, which are making a joint bid, have
taken a cautious approach with an overall initial investment worth Dollars
12m in their project valued at Dollars 50m. The group estimates that the
project requires the construction of transmission equipment by Nexus, a UK
company, worth Dollars 37m.
By Polish law, foreign shareholdings in broadcast companies are limited to
33 per cent. The hearings saw Polsat, a 100 per cent locally owned station
which is already broadcasting into Poland via satellite from Hilversum in
Holland, arguing that the new channel should stay in Polish hands.
The argument was echoed by Antena Polska, another applicant, which is
controlled by ZPR, a privatised entertainment group which owns Superexpress,
a profitable Warsaw daily, as well as a local radio station and several
gambling establishments.
The two groups which could merge to strengthen their bid, contend that the
financing of around Dollars 70m needed for the channel can be raised on
local capital markets while management expertise and programming can be
brought in from abroad.
The arguments appeared to be favourably received by the Radio and TV
Council, a broadcast media regulatory body established under laws passed
last year which removed the state's monopoly over the airwaves. A decision
on the licence is due next month.

FT  18 JAN 94 / International Company News: British banks criticise Basle
proposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British banks have become the latest group to criticise proposals from
international supervisors to make them set aside extra capital to cover
risks in foreign exchange, securities and derivatives trading.
The British Bankers' Association has told the Basle-based committee of
international bank supervisors that its proposals are too conservative and
will reduce banks' motivation to develop sophisticated risk management.
It describes as 'deeply disappointing' and 'frankly puzzling' the fact that
the proposals do not reward banks which have better monitoring systems with
reduced capital charges.
It also criticises the level of capital which the Basle supervisors propose
should be set aside to cover equity and equity derivatives positions, and
says the proposals may put banks at a competitive disadvantage to securities
firms.
The response follows a critical report from the Institute of International
Finance, representing 175 international banks, which said that the proposals
could undermine the clarity of capital rules covering credit risks.
EU banks, which will have to comply with both the EU capital adequacy
directive and Basle rules, will find the regulatory regime 'a bit messy'
unless the two are harmonised, said the association.
It is also critical of the Basle proposal for banks to make an 8 per cent
capital charge for equity positions unless they are liquid and
well-diversified, when the capital charge falls to 2 per cent. It says these
charges - double those under the EU directive - are too conservative. A 2
per cent charge on index futures and options arbitraged against a matched
cash position is described as 'certainly not justified'.
The association criticises the Basle approach of adding a capital charge for
market risk to that of a counterparty credit exposure, arguing that a market
movement cannot simultaneously increase both types of risk.
It says there is a danger that trading business will be driven to
competitors 'by a regime that imposes onerous costs on the banking
industry'.

Allied-Signal of the US has signed an agreement to acquire the seat belt
business of Gilardini, an Italian automotive supplier that is majority-owned
by Fiat, agencies report from Southfield, Michigan.
Terms of the agreement, expected to be made final on January 31, were not
disclosed.
Allied-Signal said the unit has sales of about Dollars 34m.
The US group, which also serves the aerospace sector, said it had signed
agreements to supply Fiat with air bags, seat belts and pre-tensioners,
devices that limit forward movement in a crash.
Allied-Signal also signed a three-way venture with Sequa's Atlantic Research
and Gilardini's BPD Defensa e Spazio of Italy to supply advanced air bag
inflators to European manufacturers.
The venture will be based in Colleferro, Italy, and initially will supply
Fiat in Italy and Opel in Germany.
Each company owns one third of the venture. It is scheduled to begin pilot
production in late 1994 and will be able to produce more than 2m inflators
annually.

FT  18 JAN 94 / International Company News: Bank Austria tries to force the
pace / A look at attempts to reform a savings banking sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK BLUM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The long-awaited reorganisation of Austria's savings banks sector looks set
to begin within weeks following growing pressure for action from two of the
country's leading financial institutions.
Conflicting interests and fear of change had stalled attempts at reform for
the sector, which almost everyone in Austria agrees needs restructuring to
reflect developments in the past two decades. During this time the number of
savings institutions has declined by half while the number of branches
quadrupled.
Mergers have altered the balance of forces within the sector, which is
dominated by the city of Vienna's Zentralsparkasse savings bank (now part of
Bank Austria since it merged with the Landerbank in 1991), the Erste
Osterreichische Spar-Casse, the second largest savings bank, and the five
biggest provincial savings banks, with the smaller banks fighting to
preserve their independence.
After years of fruitless discussions and broken deadlines for agreement,
Bank Austria, the country's largest commercial and savings bank, and the
Erste warned this month that either the savings banks agree to Erste's
proposals for restructuring the sector, or they will impose their own
solution through a reorganisation of GiroCredit, the savings banks' clearing
institution, in which they jointly hold more than 52 per cent.
Mr Rene Alfons Haiden, Bank Austria chairman and chief executive, said a
decision must be made by the end of February at the latest. The alternatives
are:
Bank Austria sells about two thirds of its 31 per cent stake in GiroCredit
to a consortium comprising the Erste, Austria Collegialitat Versicherung (a
leading insurance company) and the savings banks.
Erste, which already owns about 21 per cent of GiroCredit, would buy an
extra 10 per cent, making it the largest single shareholder. These shares
plus all the shares in GiroCredit held by the savings banks would be
transferred to a new holding company which would own GiroCredit. The holding
company would gradually build up stakes in its participating banks.
Failing agreement, Mr Haiden said the alternative is for Bank Austria and
Erste together to act jointly as majority shareholders in GiroCredit,
forcing changes on its supervisory and management boards, and a reassessment
of its tasks and priorities. 'We have some thoughts about a possible future
strategy for GiroCredit,' said Mr Haiden.
The proposals hang or fall on a reorganisation of the shareholding structure
of GiroCredit, which is owned by the savings banks and was established in
1937 to manage the funds of its affiliates and serve as a clearing
institution for the whole sector.
The problem is that GiroCredit has out-grown its original responsibilities
by developing banking activities that increasingly compete with those of
other banks, including some of its own shareholders. 'GiroCredit has built
itself up as a commercial and investment bank and it is a fierce competitor
(against) our bank or the Erste. It doesn't make sense,' Mr Haiden said.
The reorganisation would help to refocus GiroCredit's banking activities,
lead to considerable cost savings among the banks through synergies, and
protect savings banks against foreign or domestic predators.
'It would be an important step to keep the savings bank sector intact, to
avoid savings being sold to banks outside the savings banks sector,' says Mr
Reinhard Ortner, executive board member at Erste.
In the past, a large number of small and medium-sized savings institutions
had small stakes in GiroCredit, which was able to dominate them, but as a
result of mergers and consolidation, the seven largest savings banks now
account for about 85 per cent of total business turnover for the savings
banks.
The large savings banks have no need for an institution like GiroCredit but
the small banks need it more than in the past. 'GiroCredit should improve
and deepen its relations with these savings banks,' Mr Haiden said.
Mr Hans Haumer, GiroCredit chairman, hopes the holding company will be
approved. 'It will end three years of uncertainty, and give a significant
impulse to our activities. In the medium term it will create synergies in
close co-operation with Erste and there will be significant gains in
efficiency for the whole sector.'
Failure would be a setback for GiroCredit, but he believes a solution will
be found. 'A foreign bank could be a possibility (as a partner),' he says.
The small savings banks have been lukewarm about the proposals, fearing they
will lose more control over GiroCredit and be dominated by Erste. Only a
handful bothered to answer a letter outlining Erste's proposals.
'The direct influence of small savings banks in GiroCredit is not that
strong now. A holding company will give them at least as much influence as
they have now,' Mr Ortner said. But he insisted 'the ball is in their
court'.

FT  18 JAN 94 / International Company News: Alexander &amp; Alexander in moves
to replace chief
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Non-executive directors of Alexander &amp; Alexander have acted to replace Mr
Tinsley Irvin, the US insurance brokers' long-time chairman and chief
executive, after a succession of mishaps and disappointing results at the
group.
Mr Irvin has stepped down immediately as chairman and will be replaced as
chief executive once a replacement from outside the group has been found.
The move follows a special board meeting on Friday to consider the
management of the group.
Mr Irvin said he and the board had agreed that 'significant changes in
leadership' were necessary 'in order to accelerate the pace of change and
effect improvements in operations and earnings.'
He added: 'Some of the old ways we do business must also change.'
Two months ago, Alexander &amp; Alexander, the world's second-largest insurance
broker after Marsh &amp; McLennan, restated earnings back to 1991 when it
discovered that its Alexander Consulting Group arm had been overstating its
revenues.
Earlier last year, the group had to take a special Dollars 157.5m charge to
cover indemnity costs related mainly to a business it had sold some years
previously.
Mr Robert Boni, a former chairman of Armco, the steel company, has taken
over as chairman and will head a committee of non-executive directors
charged with finding a new chief executive for the group.
Efforts would be made to lift the company's revenues, cut its costs and
improve organisation controls, Mr Boni said. He paid tribute to the
accomplishments Mr Irvin had achieved, adding that he had brought the
company through a turbulent period.
Mr Irvin became chief executive in 1987, as the US broker was recovering
from fraud losses it suffered in Alexander Howden, the Lloyd's insurance
broker it had acquired in 1982. He became chairman a year later.
The company said it would divide these two roles in the future.
Alexander &amp; Alexander has suffered from flagging profits in its large US
retail insurance broking operations, as well as from a disappointing record
from its international acquisitions. These include Alexander Howden and, in
1985, Canadian broker Reed Stenhouse. Mr Irvin, 60, had been with the
company since 1953, and will remain a director.

FT  18 JAN 94 / International Company News: Commerzbank links with
Winterthur
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WINTERTHUR
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Winterthur Insurance is to take control of DBV Versicherung from
Commerzbank, a move which will make the Swiss group the 10th largest primary
insurer in Germany by premium income.
Winterthur, which has been seeking for several years to build up a
substantial presence in Germany, will pay Commerzbank a combination of cash
and shares for a 75 per cent interest in the holding company which has a
50.1 per cent stake in DBV. Winterthur will also transfer its own German
insurance businesses to the holding.
Mr Peter Spalti, Winterthur chairman, said that no offer would be made to
the minority shareholders of DBV, as there would be no change in the direct
ownership of the Frankfurt-quoted group.
Commerzbank will retain a minority 25 per cent in the enlarged holding. Both
it and DBV-Winterthur will exploit each other's sales networks for banking
and insurance products.
Mr Spalti said that the takeover would transform Winterthur, the Swiss
market leader, into a truly European group.
The company already has a substantial stake in the UK through its Churchill
motor insurance subsidiary and Provident Life, but earns less than a 10th of
its premium income in Germany.
The combined 1993 premium income of DBV and Winterthur's German operations
was about DM4.9bn (Dollars 2.8bn).
Nearly 60 per cent of DBV's DM3.4bn premium income last year came from life
insurance; 27 per cent from health insurance; and the rest from non-life
insurance.
Winterthur's subsidiaries in Germany earned DM1.5bn in premiums, some
two-thirds of which from non-life business.
Mr Manfred Broska, chief executive of DBV, will continue to lead the
enlarged group. Mr Broska said that the German insurance market was going
through a difficult period, because of recession and liberalisation.
However, he said he was confident that DBV, with its connections with
Commerzbank and Winterthur, was well placed to succeed.
Mr Broska said that the group expected to achieve a satisfactory result for
1993 and that there was room for another dividend increase. In 1992, it had
net income of DM32.6m and paid a dividend of DM8 per share.
Mr Spalti said Commerzbank would acquire a less than 5 per cent stake in
Winterthur as a result of the takeover and that Mr Martin Kohlhaussen,
Commerzbank's chairman, would join the Winterthur board.

FT  18 JAN 94 / International Company News: IMI bullish on foreign demand
for share issue
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Istituto Mobiliare Italiano, the Italian treasury-controlled financial
services group which is due to be privatised this month, believes foreign
institutions would like to buy about three times the amount of shares
allocated to them.
Soundings by SG Warburg, the UK merchant bank, and IMI, which are together
co-ordinating the privatisation, have so far indicated foreign institutions
want to buy almost 300m shares.
The offer, to raise up to L2,200bn (Dollars 1.29bn), involves selling 200m
shares - a third of IMI's capital. About half will go abroad, some 75m to
Italian private investors and the balance to Italian institutions. Pricing
will be revealed on January 29 and the sale will start two days later.
The bullish oversubscription forecast, made by a senior official, came on
the first day of roadshows to illustrate the deal to international
investors.
Mr Mario Draghi, the director general of the treasury, which directly or
indirectly holds about 90 per cent of the shares being sold, said the state
would dispose of its entire stake within a number of years. Following the
privatisation, it will hold about 30 per cent of IMI against just over 60
per cent at present.
Mr Draghi warned that a bigger first tranche would risk swamping the market
ahead of other privatisations, beginning with Banca Commerciale Italiana on
February 28.
However, some analysts believe the caution stems partly from concern to stop
Cariplo, the Milan-based savings bank, gaining control of IMI too cheaply.
Cariplo already has 8 per cent of IMI and has said it will raise its stake
to the 10 per cent limit.
However, that limit is only valid until October 1996, after which it could
be abolished provided enough big shareholders agree. In that case, Cariplo,
which tried unsuccessfully to buy IMI directly from the treasury last year,
might attempt to raise its stake further.

FT  18 JAN 94 / International Company News: German banks to contribute more
to Metallgesellschaft
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank, the two biggest banks in Germany, have
agreed to increase their contribution to the Metallgesellschaft rescue
package by a total of DM300m (Dollars 177m), it emerged yesterday .
It is understood that foreign banks will be given the chance to scale down
their contribution to the rights issue element of the package to only a
fraction of the original proposal, a move which served to placate foreign
bankers' objections to acquiring new shares in the Frankfurt-based mining,
metals and industrial conglomerate.
Metallgesellschaft granted these concessions on Saturday during talks which
ended by securing the DM3.4bn rescue package.
The bail-out averted the threat of bankruptcy which hung over the group last
week, serving to trigger a sharp rise in MG's share price yesterday. The
shares rose 12.5 per cent to close DM27 up at DM241.
The deal has three elements:
A DM1.4bn rights issue. MG's core shareholders - a group which include
Deutsche and Dresdner, the Emirate of Kuwait, Daimler-Benz and the Allianz
insurance group - will contribute 62 per cent of these funds.
It was originally proposed that creditor banks subscribe to the remaining 38
per cent in proportion to their credit exposure.
This caused grave problems for foreign banks and it is understood that the
German banking community has undertaken to take up 85 per cent of the
balance. Bankers said yesterday that this left foreign banks' contribution
at 10 per cent of the level first proposed.
DM700m of fresh credit. Deutsche and Dresdner are understood to have agreed
to contribute DM100m each to this, thus reversing their original position
that they should not be required to contribute any further funds after
providing DM1.5bn in emergency credits last month.
Bankers will convert DM1.3bn of bank debt into junior convertible stock.
Following Saturday's negotiations, Deutsche and Dresdner have each
contributed an extra DM50m to this element of the package, leading to an 8
per cent improvement in the terms for other banks.
These securities will be convertible into MG ordinary shares at a price of
DM250 as of 1996.
Bankers expressed relief yesterday that the refinancing had been successful.
They said the package may remove the need to make provisions against their
loans to MG, whereas they would have had to write off up to half their loans
if the group had been declared insolvent.
MG said yesterday that Mr Kajo Neukirchen, chief executive, would outline
his strategy for the future of the group in February.
Shareholders will vote on the refinancing proposals at a special meeting
convened for February 24.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Reg Vardy, the multi-franchise motor retail group, has acquired three sites
from KPMG Peat Marwick, the administrative receiver for Swithland Motors,
the failed Midlands-based group.
The sites - in Woodgate and Blackbird Road, Leicester and Hall Green,
Birmingham - are to be extensively redeveloped before opening as franchised
dealerships in the spring.
Fiat and Alfa Romeo will be represented at Hall Green and one of the
Leicester locations, while Vardy may relocate its Audi Volkswagen
dealerships to the other newly acquired site.
The deal takes Vardy's dealership total to 29 - of which 26 are operational
 -and comes two weeks after it acquired a sizeable Toyota/Lexus franchise in
Newcastle upon Tyne.

FT  18 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Scottish fund managers with an eye on
expansion - James Buxton examines the differing approaches as Edinburgh
chases the US business hard
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Iain Watt is in no doubt about it. 'I'd be a liar if I said that being
Scottish wasn't an asset in marketing ourselves in the US,' he says. 'We
capitalise on the respectability of Edinburgh.
Mr Watt is chief executive of Edinburgh Fund Managers, the quoted investment
management company based in the Scottish capital. It is now opening a small
office in Atlanta, Georgia, to tap the US market for fund management
services.
As US pension funds diversify from their historical concentration on North
American stock exchanges - nearly Dollars 50bn (Pounds 33.7bn) of pension
fund assets flowed out of the US in the first half of 1993 alone - British
fund managers are winning some of the international fund management business
being generated, because of their experience in overseas markets, especially
in east Asia.
Edinburgh, Britain's main centre of fund management expertise after London,
is chasing the US business hard. Fund managers such as Dunedin, Baillie
Gifford and Martin Currie each have more than Dollars 1bn of US pension fund
money under management. While all the Scottish fund managers make the
investment decisions at head office, they differ in the way they operate in
the US, and in whether or not they play the Scottish card.
EFM currently manages only Dollars 200m on behalf of US clients and Mr Watt
admits that its initial approach to the US market was wrong. For six years
it was in a joint venture with Wilmington Trust, a US fund manager. 'The
joint venture just confused the clients,' says Mr Watt. Last month it was
dissolved.
The company has now learned the lesson absorbed six years ago by Dunedin
which, with Dollars 1.7bn worth of US money under management, is probably by
a short head the most successful Scottish fund manager in the US. 'If
someone else does your marketing for you, you don't do yourself justice,'
says Mr Alan Kemp, deputy chief executive.
Dunedin, 50 per cent owned by the British Linen Bank, part of Bank of
Scotland, now has an office in Chicago employing five people to service
clients. But presentations to the pension fund consultants who choose the
fund managers are made by senior executives who fly out from Scotland.
Mr Kemp says that it requires long lead times to make progress in the US
fund management market. 'It can take several years for the consultants to
feel comfortable with you. But after a certain point the money begins to
flow.
Dunedin, he says, owes much of its success to its investment record in
Japanese and other east Asian markets, which is where it places most of the
money it raises in the US. 'The US fund management market is highly
professional and consultants are ruthless about performance. They really
dismantle you.
Even though a remarkable number of Americans claim some Scottish ancestry or
have an affection for Scotland, Mr Kemp says Dunedin does not stress its
Scottishness. 'They're not going to award you a fund management contract
just because you're wearing a kilt.
At Baillie Gifford, Mr Ross Lidstone, marketing director for US pension
funds, agrees. 'I don't think people pick Scottish fund managers because
they are Scottish.
'We sell ourselves as international investment managers who happen to be
located in Scotland. But we do stress the advantages of being in Edinburgh:
I see those as low staff turnover (the clients like to see the same people),
and expertise based on international fund management going back to the 19th
century.
Baillie Gifford does not have an office in the US, doing all its marketing
on visits from Scotland and inviting the clients to Edinburgh. 'Americans
like to see the home office of the fund manager and meet a wider selection
of people in the firm. They couldn't do that at an office in Chicago.'
Baillie Gifford took about five years to make an impact in the US where it
began operating in 1983. But last year alone, however, it gained Dollars
500m of new business and took in Dollars 200m from existing clients,
bringing its US total up to Dollars 1.6bn - more than a tenth of the
company's total funds under management of Pounds 10.1bn, or Dollars 14.9bn.
At Martin Currie Mr James Dawnay, marketing director, says the company has
been rebuilding its US operations since 1990, having started there in the
1970s before turning away to the UK pension market.
'We've grown dramatically in the US in the past 18 months and now manage
about Dollars 1.4bn from there, using a marketing group in Connecticut to
open doors for us. We don't hype up Edinburgh and Scotland but it helps
differentiate us from London. What we sell is our ability to manage global
equity portfolios with a bias towards smaller markets.'
Murray Johnstone, the Glasgow-based fund manager which recently sold itself
to United Asset Management of the US, handles its US operations through
Murray Johnstone International, with an office in Chicago. Murray Johnstone
International is a smaller participant in the US fund management market than
the big three Edinburgh houses, but has pushed up its assets under
management from Dollars 230m in 1990 to about Dollars 800m.
Ivory &amp; Sime, the quoted Edinburgh fund management house which is now doing
better after a few years of internal turmoil, manages Dollars 600m of US
money, half of it from pension funds. It has a joint venture called Ivory &amp;
Sime International in Chatham, New Jersey, with a US partner.
Mr George Walker, marketing director, admits Ivory &amp; Sime had suffered in
the US from the rapidly changing faces of its managers, but says things have
stabilised in the last few years. 'Americans do like to see the same face,'
he acknowledges.

FT  18 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Dalepak hit by frozen food side
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As forewarned in October, Dalepak Foods broke even for its opening six
months with profits for the period to end-October working through at just
Pounds 29,000 at the pre-tax level.
The profits setback, down from Pounds 1.6m previously, was struck from
turnover some 10 per cent lower at Pounds 19.19m.
Interest payable rose by Pounds 21,000 to Pounds 151,000 due to the high
level of capital expenditure in the previous year.
Earnings per share declined to 0.16p (9.3p) and the interim dividend is cut
by 1p to 0.5p.
The shares slipped 6p to 139p.
Mr Michael Abrahams, chairman of the North Yorkshire-based frozen foods and
ready made meals manufacturer, blamed the profits downturn on the main
frozen foods business which suffered a 13 per cent fall in turnover.
Lower selling prices, due to retailer price pressure, accounted for 4 per
cent of the fall, while curtailment of promotional activity at unprofitable
prices accounted for 9 per cent.
He pointed out that sterling's devaluation in 1992 had added 11 per cent to
raw material costs which could not be recovered because of a highly
competitive retail food market and weak consumer demand.
The frozen foods division ended the half year with a trading loss.
Price increases have been implemented on some products in the division to
recover margins, the pace of product development has been accelerated and
costs reduced throughout the business.
Mr Abrahams said these initiatives were starting to show through, and he
anticipated improved results in the second half.
At the period-end gearing stood at 31.7 per cent, compared with 39.8 per
cent in April. It was expected to rise 'modestly' towards the end of the
year.

FT  18 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Colorvision in red as market share suffers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Colorvision, the Liverpool-based television and video retailer, fell into
losses of Pounds 1.26m pre-tax in the 26 weeks to September 30, against
profits of Pounds 153,000.
Mr Neville Michaelson, chairman, said that following his warning that there
had been no improvement in sales in the first quarter, trading deteriorated
in the next three months, traditionally the quietest time of the year.
He added that market share had fallen in core markets. He blamed
inconsistent marketing campaigns, concentration of senior management on
superstore development and over-emphasis on cost savings in operational
management.
The shares lost 17p yesterday to close at 98p.
However, Mr Michaelson added that remedial action had been taken and with
third quarter sales 7.4 per cent ahead of the comparable period, market
share and gross margins recovered.
During December the company opened a second superstore in Liverpool. And Mr
Michaelson said that since he had last reported two more high street stores
had opened but two store concessions had closed.
That took the number of outlets, including the superstores, to 90.
Turnover for the first half was Pounds 26m (Pounds 26.7m). Losses per share
came out at 4p (0.5p earnings).
However, in view of the improved second half trading the interim dividend is
held at 2.5p and the board expects to be able to maintain the total for the
year at 5.6p.

FT  18 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Triton Energy bids for UK minority
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Triton Energy, the ind-ependent US oil and gas company, yesterday made an
offer equivalent to 37 1/2 p for the shares of UK-based Triton Europe that
it does not already own.
The offer values Triton Europe at Pounds 30.9m. Triton Energy already owns
59.47 per cent of the company, which wrote down the value of its oil and gas
properties by Pounds 41m last September.
Triton Europe's main interest lies in the Paris basin, which has been
suffering from declining production. It incurred a loss of Pounds 50m for
the year to May 31.
The consideration will be satisfied by the issue of new unlisted 5 per cent
convertible preferred stock in Triton Energy.
The shares closed yesterday at 33p, up 13p.
The independent directors are recommending the offer. Mr Bill Smith, one of
the independent directors, said the company's exploration had proved
unsuccessful and there was no liquidity in the shares.
The three largest minority shareholders - Provident Mutual, Legal &amp; General
and LL Capital Partners - intend to vote in favour. The three own or control
18.3 per cent of the company, or just over 45 per cent of the shares not
owned by Triton Energy.
Shareholders can also elect to receive cash up to a maximum of Dollars
10,000 each subject to a maximum cash outlay by Triton Energy of Dollars 2m
(Pounds 1.3m).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Soundtracs rose 7p to 80p yesterday after the USM-traded
professional electronic audio equipment and loudspeaker group announced a 76
per cent jump in annual pre-tax profits as it benefited from the
introduction of new products.
Mr Todd Wells, chairman, said the increase - from Pounds 350,385 to Pounds
615,587 - was achieved despite the market remaining 'highly competitive,
fragmented and difficult in such key territories as Japan and central
Europe'.
Research and development expenditure, written off as it incurs, now accounts
for some 6.7 per cent of revenue.
Three new mixing consoles are scheduled for the current year.
Turnover for the 12 months to November 6 improved 34 per cent to Pounds
5.51m (Pounds 4.11m).
Earnings per share emerged at 4.09p (2.45p) and a proposed fiinal dividend
of 1.48p brings the total for the year to 2.4p (2.2p).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Aerospace Engineering, the precision product manufacturer for the aerospace
and electronics industries, lifted pre-tax profits from Pounds 109,000 to
Pounds 127,000 for the six months ended October 31.
Turnover was from continuing operations and totalled Pounds 7.72m against
Pounds 13.6m last time which took in Pounds 5.03m from discontinued
operations.
Operating profits for the half year were substantially lower at Pounds
313,000, against Pounds 689,000. The pre-tax figure was helped by a Pounds
50,000 profit on a property disposal and lower interest of Pounds 236,000,
compared with Pounds 580,000. Comparatives have been adjusted in accordance
with FRS 3.
Earnings per share were 0.12p (0.19p) while the interim dividend is
maintained at 0.25p.
Mr John Davis, chairman, said the pace of recovery was slower than desired
and 'consequently the current year continues to be difficult'.
He pointed out that the performance in the aerospace sector had been mixed,
while within the electronics division, sales of microwave and conventional
circuit boards continued to be strongly influenced by the new European GSM
market for digital cellular phones.

Shares in Thorntons rose 11p to 193p yesterday as the chocolate maker and
retailer reported improved sales for the 28 weeks to January 8 1994.
Total UK retail sales, including franchise, increased by 9.1 per cent to

In the four weeks prior to Christmas they showed a 13.6 per cent rise over
the comparable period.
Commercial sales for the 28 weeks were ahead 16.5 per cent at Pounds 11.4m.
In France, however, where the Thorntons businesses have undergone a
restructuring following a period of accumulating losses, the directors said
that sales were slightly lower at Pounds 2.2m.

FT  18 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Chiroscience set to raise Pounds 35m -
Flotation will provide fresh funds for research and development
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chiroscience, the pharmaceuticals company, yesterday said it would raise
Pounds 35m from its forthcoming flotation.
More than 80 per cent of the new capital will be used to expand research and
development at the Cambridge-based group, which is expected to have a market
capitalisation of Pounds 100m.
Mr Peter Keen, finance director, said the float would allow the company to
concentrate on the development of single isomer drugs - its core business
strategy. If successful, such drugs could give Chiroscience a turnover of
about Dollars 100m (Pounds 68m) by the end of the decade, he added.
The company based its estimates on industry forecasts which suggest demand
for single isomer products could account for more than half of all
pharmaceutical output by 2000.
Demand is expected to increase because, unlike most organic drugs currently
on the market, the new drugs do not have pairs of isomers - molecular
compounds which have identical structures but which can produce different
effects.
Ensuring patients get only the isomer they need from drugs can be vital. One
isomer of thalidomide, for example, cures morning sickness; the other can
cause foetal deformity.
Mr Chris Evans, chief scientific officer at Chiroscience, said: 'Our
programme is to get rid of the isomers which don't fit in.'
To that end the company has pursued three business areas: manufacturing
single isomer compounds for companies such as Glaxo, Wellcome and Abbott;
developing single isomer versions of existing drugs; and producing new
pharmaceutical products from its research arm.
Mr Keen said supply contracts with large manufacturers would offset losses
incurred by research costs. However, Chiroscience does not expect to make a
profit before 1998.
In the six months to August 1993, the company incurred a pre-tax loss of
Pounds 1.37m, although its manufacturing business generated sales of Pounds
1.34m.
In spite of the losses, Mr Keen said he was confident that the 45 per cent
public offer would be a success.
Terms of the placing and offer for sale are to be announced on January 27.

FT  18 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Butte Mining puts value on litigation
claims
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Butte Mining, the UK-quoted company whose main activity is prosecuting US
lawsuits - it is seeking damages from former managers and promoters  -
estimates that, if it succeeds with its maximum claim for nearly Dollars 1bn
(Pounds 600m), this would be worth 129p a share.
Yesterday Butte shares, which languished at 2 3/4 p at the beginning of
1994, moved up  1/4 p to 4 3/4 p.
In the annual report, Mr David Lloyd-Jacob, chairman, includes estimates of
how much the litigation might bring shareholders - estimates are made
complex because others have first call on some of the proceeds.
For example, Deutsch &amp; Frey, its US contingent-fee attorney, is entitled to
one third of the gross proceeds from the litigation while the management
team is entitled to a further 5.25 per cent, but of that 4.5 per cent would
be paid only on proceeds above Pounds 15m.
Mr Lloyd-Jacob suggests that, assuming the number of Butte's issued shares
remains at 287m and the exchange rate is Dollars 1.5 to the Pounds , an
award of Dollars 100m would be worth 12p a share; one of Dollars 200m would
be worth 25p a share; one of Dollars 300m, 38p; Dollars 400m, 51p; Dollars
500m, 64p; Dollars 600m, 77p; Dollars 700m, 90p; Dollars 800m, 103p; and
Dollars 900m, 116p.
The US lawsuits are expected to come to trial within two years, says Mr
Lloyd-Jacob, and the prospects for significant awards are 'excellent.'
Mr Lloyd-Jacob says that in 1993 executives deferred their salaries and
'sometimes paid (Butte's) bills themselves. He was paid only Pounds 12,500
of his Pounds 50,000 entitlement.

FT  18 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Peel tops Pounds 2m with help from port
side
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Peel Holdings, the Man-chester-based property group, yesterday reported a
rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.64m to Pounds 2.21m for the six months
to September 30.
Mr John Whitaker, chairman, said the property leasing market remained
extremely competitive and the company was only marginally increasing
property development activities, despite more favourable market conditions.
Turnover increased to Pounds 33m (Pounds 32.2m) boosted by Pounds 4.4m from
land disposals and net rental income of Pounds 20.1m.
In the second half of the year the company will accrue an additional Pounds
880,000 as a result of the expiry of rent free agreements and from upward
rent reviews.
Losses per share emerged at 0.61p (0.95p) but the interim dividend is lifted
to 1.3p (1p) reflecting expectations of a stronger second half.
Manchester Ship Canal's port operations contributed Pounds 2.5m at the
operating level. The operations are seasonable and should record a higher
contribution in the second half.
Analysts also expect an improved performance from Peel's core property
business.
The company last year won a six year battle to buy out the minority
shareholders of Manchester Ship Canal in order to realise some of the
redevelopment value of the company's substantial land bank.
Peel is proposing the Pounds 200m construction of a commercial centre on a
300-acre site next to the canal, but planning permission is still being
blocked by eight local authorities, which are appealing a court ruling
allowing the project to go ahead.
Peel's debt levels remain high with net debt marginally increasing from its
March 1993 figure of Pounds 336m. Analysts forecast year-end gearing of
about 100 per cent.
Net interest of Pounds 17.5m (Pounds 19.4m) in the first half, compared with
operating profit of Pounds 19.8m (Pounds 21.1m).

FT  18 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Pittencrieff splits activities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pittencrieff yesterday announced plans to split its oil and gas interests
from the rapidly growing mobile communications operation based in the US.
The company proposes to offer shareholders the choice to vote for a simple
demerger with a cash alternative, or to allow the mobile communications
subsidiary to buy the parent's 54 per cent interest in it.
The quoted company in the UK will then be liquidated, which will protect the
company from capital gains tax arising on the transactions. The oil and gas
division will be relisted under a new name.
Pittencrieff last year floated off 46 per cent of Pittencrieff
Communications, earning Dollars 68m (Pounds 46m) net of expenses.
Mr Terry Heneaghan, chairman, said the oil and gas division had been
inhibiting the 'frantic pace' of growth in the communications business, and
vice versa. 'Neither could issue stock while they were linked because the
value of each of the two parts was more than that of the whole'.
Mr Heneaghan said Pittencrieff hoped to return to the market with an
acquisition. It is also likely that it will seek to raise funds through a
placing or share issue.
The details are expected to be completed by March, with the full demerger or
sale concluded in the summer.

FT  18 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Carclo advances to Pounds 5.19m - Existing
businesses decline but Arthur Lee buy exceeds forecasts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Carclo Engineering Group yesterday announced a 41 per cent increase in
interim pre-tax profit, reflecting a better than expected performance from
Arthur Lee, the engineering group it acquired in June 1993.
Mr John Ewart, chairman, said that order books were significantly fuller
than last year, although margins remained under pressure in its core card
clothing division.
Turnover for the six months to September 30 advanced to Pounds 65.6m (Pounds
40.7m) with a contribution of Pounds 23.8m from Arthur Lee. Pre-tax profits
amounted to Pounds 5.19m (Pounds 3.68m).
Earnings per share increased by 0.6p to 6.9p and an interim dividend of 1.9p
(1.8p) is declared.
Arthur Lee's operating profit during the period more than doubled to Pounds
3.34m (Pounds 1.35m), of which Pounds 1.47m related to the period before
acquisition, leaving a contribution of Pounds 1.87m to operating profits.
Mr Ewart said the result was 'better than any pre-acquisition forecasts'.
This contrasted with the performance of the existing businesses. The card
clothing division suffered a 12 per cent drop in operating profit to Pounds
1.35m (Pounds 1.53m), primarily due to the economic downturn in continental
Europe, where it operates three factories.
General engineering contributed a lower Pounds 928,000 (Pounds 1.16m); wire
division profits, however, increased to Pounds 868,000 (Pounds 754,000). The
RSR division improved to Pounds 390,000 (Pounds 353,000).
Bruntons, the wire manufacturing subsidiary which is being reorganised
following the merger with Arthur Lee, has picked up contracts worth more
than Pounds 4m for the Tsing Ma bridge linking Hong Kong with its new
airport.
Carclo also announced it had sold its 16.6 per cent stake in Bombay-listed
Indian Card Clothing for Pounds 1.2m.
COMMENT
The merger with Arthur Lee has proven well-timed, as it has coincided with
stagnant earnings from the core businesses. By comparison, Lee had a strong
performance in all three divisions, particularly Lee Steel Strip, which
helped steel profits jump from Pounds 700,000 to Pounds 2.15m. There should
be more to come, as the synergistic benefits from the acquisition have yet
to come through into group earnings. The companies are merging head offices
and restructuring their wire manufacturing divisions. Lee will remain the
engine for growth for the current year, but in 1994-95 the core Carclo
businesses should benefit from an estimated Pounds 7m in capital expenditure
during the current financial year. Full-year profits are likely to top
Pounds 12m, for a prospective p/e of 19. This suggests that the extent of
the current earnings upswing is written into the share price.

FT  18 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Amersham speeds up US acquisition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Amersham International, the UK health science group, announced yesterday it
was speeding up its acquisition of United States Biochemical, the
privately-owned supplier of pharmaceutical and biotechnology reagents.
Last March Amersham paid Dollars 52m (Pounds 35m) for the Cleveland-based
company and agreed to pay a further Dollars 17.25m over three years,
depending on sales of USB products.
Since then the UK group has realised that it could make considerable cost
savings by integrating USB's North American business with its own life
science operations.
Mr Kirk Stephenson, finance director, said yesterday: 'We have decided to
streamline our North American operations. The tidying up can be done now
rather than later.'
Amersham staff in Chicago will oversee a combined sales, orders and
distribution department for the two companies, while USB's existing
manufacturing and research workforce are to remain with the subsidiary.
Rather than pay Dollars 17.25m over three years, the company said it would
satisfy the deferred instalments with an immediate Dollars 10m fixed
payment.
The transaction involves a Dollars 5.72m cash payment and the issue of
286,557 Amersham ordinary shares to USB's owners.
As part of the deal, which will be completed tomorrow, the owners of USB
have agreed to retain their Amersham shares until April 1996.

FT  18 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Beverley holders approve deals to eliminate
debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER and MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shareholders in Beverley Group, the engineering concern, yesterday approved
the sale of a group of properties and businesses to a vehicle controlled by
the company's executive directors.
The company, which says the transactions, including the sale of a cash rich
subsidiary for Pounds 1, are designed to eliminate debt, has now embarked on
an acquisition programme. The first purchase is likely to be announced by
the end of March.
Mr Colin Robinson, chairman, said Beverley was now in a net cash position.
It would seek to double its size through an acquisition, which would be
funded through some form of equity capital raising.
About 15 private shareholders attended the extraordinary meeting in Bristol
to vote on the proposals. These called for the sale of Gall Thomson Marine,
the group's most profitable subsidiary, to Villiers, an independent
USM-quoted company, for Pounds 4m.
The second resolution proposed the sale of two subsidiaries for Pounds 1
each to Woodlands Grange Engineering, the executive directors' privately
owned company. One of the companies being sold was left with Pounds 237,000
in cash, the amount which Beverley said it would cost to make the business's
employees redundant. Debt of Pounds 812,000 owed by the second company to
the quoted parent was written off and bank borrowings of Pounds 359,000
repaid.
All the shareholders present voted in favour, although some proxy votes had
been cast against the sales to executive directors. Mr Robinson said as
there had been no need for a poll, the proxies had not been counted. The
executive directors involved in the transactions did not vote.
One institutional investor said that although there had been initial
concerns over the transactions with directors the benefits had 'outweighed
the hit that we as shareholders would have had to take if they had not gone
through'.

FT  18 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Ratners shareholder wins damages
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON and MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A US arbitration panel has ordered underwriter CS First Boston to pay
Dollars 37,500 (Pounds 25,100) to an American fund which invested in
preferred stock of Ratners, the British jewellery group now known as Signet,
not long before Ratners' credit rating was downgraded.
It is the first case to be settled of several pending against CS First
Boston and fellow underwriter Goldman Sachs over an issue of Ratners auction
market preferred shares in 1991. There is also one case against Signet
itself.
The fund, CMB Realty Trust, bought Dollars 200,000 of the Ratners issue and
had sought damages of Dollars 200,000, claiming First Boston had
misrepresented the shares as a 'safe and secure investment with a very
decent yield.'
A panel from the National Association of Securities Dealers made no comment
in making the award. It rejected CMB's request that CS First Boston void the
trade and return its money.
Signet shares rose 1p to 33 1/2 p yesterday.
The suit against Signet from Glamorgan Coal, a US investor, is not expected
to come to court for some time. In its 1993 accounts Signet said it did not
consider that the claim would have a 'significant effect' on the company's
finances. Yesterday Signet said the position had not changed since the
accounts were published.
Signet issued two tranches of auction market preferred shares in the US, the
second in 1991, totalling Dollars 250m. Regular auctions of the shares set
the interest rate on them and they are redeemable only at the company's
option.
When the group's financial difficulties deepened, the credit rating on the
shares dropped and auctions failed, meaning that a fall-back rate of
interest was set on Dollars 200m of the total. This is updated every four
weeks, and is set at 250 per cent of a benchmark US commercial paper rate.
Signet stopped paying the interest on the shares in January 1992. This has
been rolled up since and now totals Pounds 65m.
Signet cannot pay dividends on its ordinary shares until the interest on the
preference shares has been paid. In the 1993 accounts there was a loss on
distributable reserves of Pounds 65.9m. A capital restructuring is expected
to address these losses.
Mr James McAdam said last July that before a capital restructuring could be
considered, the group had to 'get the trading line right'. Last week it
published sales figures covering the crucial Christmas period, which Mr
McAdam said indicated a return to profits was likely in the financial year
ending this month.

FT  18 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Albert Fisher makes Dollars 25m fresh
produce purchase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Albert Fisher, the food processing and distribution group, is paying up to
Dollars 25m (Pounds 17m) for certain assets of Fresh Western Marketing, a
Californian supplier of fresh produce.
Fresh Western operates under the River Ranch brand. Through relationships
with growers and joint ventures it grows, stores and distributes a variety
of produce to the retail sector and food service distributors across the US.
Albert Fisher said that as well as being a leading supplier of salad mixes,
Fresh Western also brought to the group patented technology for extending
produce shelf life.
This used a two-way breathable membrane to control the flow of oxygen and
carbon dioxide into and out of the sealed package, thereby considerably
extending the life of certain items of fresh produce as well as other food
products and flowers.
Albert Fisher said the acquisition was expected to enhance earnings in its
first year. The initial cash payment will be about Dollars 7.8m, the book
value of the net assets acquired. The profit-related deferred consideration
is payable in cash to a maximum Dollars 25m.
Fresh Western's turnover in 1993 was about Dollars 200m, of which about 25
per cent was exported, principally to east Asia, for an estimated pre-tax
profit of Dollars 4.5m.
Mr Stephen Walls, chairman of Albert Fisher, said: 'The addition of Fresh
Western's technology, markets, produce expertise and grower connections
represents an important extension to our capabilities in the fast-growing
prepared salad markets for retail and food service customers.
'The operations complement the Albert Fisher North American distribution and
regional processing companies in produce range, procurement, services and
markets.'

Sir Antony Pilkington, chairman of the Pilkington glass group, has exercised
options and sold the shares, taking a profit of nearly Pounds 60,000 before
expenses.
Sir Antony bought 128,500 shares last Friday by exercising options at 139
2/3 p. He sold the same number of shares the same day at 185 1/2 p, giving a
gross profit of Pounds 58,900.
The deal leaves his holding of shares held beneficially at a little less
than 1m, representing 0.1 per cent of the total shares in issue. He is also
listed as a non-beneficial owner of shares held in trusts.

FT  18 JAN 94 / Nokia and Hewlett in alliance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nokia, the Finnish tele-communications manufacturer, has joined forces with
Hewlett-Packard, the US electronics group, to develop the next generation of
telecoms infrastructure.
They have forged a strategic alliance to develop 'intelligent network'
systems. The move underlines the convergence of computing and telecoms.
Intelligent networks use advanced electronics to provide new services such
as freephone, personal numbering and call forwarding.
The alliance pools Nokia's telecoms expertise with Hewlett-Packard's
computing platforms. The value of the deal is undisclosed, but 'several
hundred' employees will be involved.
Nokia, the world's second largest manufacturer of infrastructure for
cellular networks, is keen to broaden its telecoms business, which last year
accounted for nearly half its Dollars 3.1bn (Pounds 2bn) turnover. It will
take responsibility for marketing and sales, expected to start later this
year. Research and development will be carried out at Nokia's base at Espoo,
Finland, and Hewlett-Packard's European centre at Grenoble, France.
For Hewlett-Packard, the venture is one of several recent moves into
mainstream telecoms. A year ago it launched a venture with Ericsson, the
Swedish telecoms manufacturer, to provide network management systems.
It also has links with Northern Telecom of Canada.
Ovum, the London-based consultants, estimate annual expenditure on
intelligent network systems could reach Dollars 5bn in Europe by 2000. By
then, these services are expected to account for 10-15 per cent of
call-charge revenue, up from 3 per cent.
Mr Matti Alahuhta, president of Nokia Telecommunications, said: 'It was an
obvious step for us to seek a long-term agreement with Hewlett-Packard, a
leader in open-systems computing which also has a strong commitment to the
telecom industry.'
Mr Jeremy Ledger, a UK analyst with the consultancy Dataquest, said the deal
was 'a notable stage in the convergence of different IT sectors in a field
where the market opportunities are strong and growing'.

FT  18 JAN 94 / Reuters' news flurry dispels mature image: UK business
information group's aggressive return to the acquisition trail has cheered
analysts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Reuters Holdings may have bought a loss-making business from Citicorp, the
US bank, yet the deal has done nothing but good for the business information
group's share price. Since it was announced last Thursday, the shares have
gained 95p, closing yesterday at a new high of 1920p.
The purchase of the data service business fulfils a long-held aim of Reuters
 -expansion in US equity markets - and confirms that the UK-based company is
not just sitting back on its position in the global financial markets, where
it has long dominated foreign exchange trading.
Quotron is the latest in a flurry of acquisitions since July, when Reuters
spent half its cash mountain on a Pounds 350m share repurchase scheme.
Analysts who were concerned last year that Reuters was facing mature markets
have been cheered by the group's aggressive return to the acquisition trail.
They say the group's record and prospects also compare well with other media
companies in a sector which has been uprated recently.
Some Reuters acquisitions - such as last month's Dollars 121.5m (Pounds
81.4m) cash purchase of Teknekron Software Systems, a Californian software
supplier and systems integrator - are obvious additions to the core
business. Other smaller deals represent a 'testing of the water' in emerging
areas such as multimedia products.
Mr Rob Rowley, Reuters' finance director, heads a small team which for the
past 18 months has been looking at new business opportunities. The brief
from Mr Peter Job, Reuters' chief executive, was a rigorous appraisal of
which of the group's skills had the most value.
Mr Rowley says: 'We used to be heavily involved in engineering, designing
our own hardware. Increasingly, we buy off the shelf because we can buy
things in more cheaply than making them ourselves. We don't want to be in
the low-added-value end of the business.'
An example of Reuters' more speculative approach is last month's decision to
take a Dollars 3m minority stake in AdValue Media technologies, a private
New York company which markets interactive transaction services to
advertising agencies, sales representatives and media outlets. It was the
first deal struck since the formation of Reuters NewMedia, a US-based
subsidiary operating in emerging markets for multimedia products. Mr Rowley
says of AdValue: 'It is involved in real-time changes in bookings and
transactions, an environment we were familiar with.'
Reuters has identified television as a potential contributor to its core
financial business and as a route into new business areas. The group
increased its television interests in 1992 by taking full control of
Visnews, the international TV news agency. Last week Reuters announced it
would launch a financial TV service for the foreign exchange market around
the middle of this year. Traders will have important news events delivered
digitally to their trading screens.
However - just as in its financial business - Reuters would rather not
become over-committed to any particular hardware. Mr Rowley says: 'It would
be easy to spend Pounds 200m on a cable TV company - but on a 10-year view,
cable will become a utility. We try to avoid looking into the technological
void and instead concentrate on developing good products.'
He believes that growing familiarity with personal computers has made them
more important than television. 'If people become PC-expert at work, they
are more likely to use them at home. We aim to exploit these high-value
opportunities.'
This interest in what products will appeal to prosperous, professional
customers helps explain Reuters' recent Pounds 13.3m acquisition of VAMP
Health, a private UK company which provides computer services to about 2,000
general practitioners. Mr Rowley says: 'Computers in UK doctors' surgeries
is a somewhat limited market, but we'll learn about an industry before we
invest large sums of money in it.'
When Reuters announced its share repurchase scheme last year, Mr Job said:
'We have absorbed two messages from shareholders: they want us to continue
to invest in the business, but they don't want us to invest just for the
sake of investing.'
Reuters says most of the group's larger acquisitions in the 1980s were
relatively successful - such as Instinet, the computerised share trading
system, and Rich, the designer of communication systems for trading rooms.
But Mr Rowley concedes 'we picked up a few scars along the way. We need to
be careful of personality.' He added: 'In the 1980s there was a Reuters
culture that we had to own or have effective control - we're much more
open-minded now.'
Mr Rowley says group capital expenditure was up last year and will grow
further, involving both acquisitions and organic growth. 'We have lots of
ideas, not necessarily multimedia. Our existing markets are still very
exciting. One way people stay ahead is by constantly innovating.'
Reuters would certainly invest more in Globex, its electronic futures
trading system, if and when the wrangling between the participating
international futures markets is sorted out. The UK group has also been
promising to respond to the challenge from the products of Bloomberg, the US
group which has done so well in the fixed-interest market.
However, Mr Rowley has no fears over Reuters' survival in a world which
might be dominated by multimedia giants. Recent rumours that it might be a
target for takeover by Reed-Elsevier were quickly denied by the Anglo-Dutch
publishing group.
Mr Rowley merely points out that Reuters' independence is guaranteed by a
single 'founder's share', created when the company was floated in 1984. A
link-up with a newspaper and magazine publishers such as Reed-Elsevier would
take Reuters closer to the mass market - not the differentiated, high-value
areas which the group is determined to keep in focus. He says: 'We've no
feel of being threatened - we're used to working in an open environment.'

FT  18 JAN 94 / Eastern first to buy back shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Eastern Electricity yesterday became the first regional electricity company
to buy back some of its shares since the industry's privatisation three
years ago.
It spent about Pounds 7.7m buying 1.2m shares - 0.4 per cent of the equity.
It said it intended to buy back up to 5 per cent.
The move, announced after the close of trading yesterday, is expected to set
a trend in the sector, although some companies will await the outcome of a
regulatory review of power distribution before following Eastern's lead.
Analysts said the move was likely to have a positive effect on shares in the
12 regional power distributors.
An increasing number of companies are seeking shareholders' permission to
buy back shares, although few have carried it out. Those with strong cash
inflows and net cash, but limited growth opportunities, are among those most
likely to do so.
Eastern won approval to buy back up to 13.5m shares at its annual meeting
last August. It has about Pounds 90m cash, which at the current price of
644p is slightly more than what would be needed to buy back all 13.5m.
Mr Eric Anstee, finance director, said the buy-back would have a 'mildly
positive' effect on earnings per share.
Putting the cash on deposit attracted a rate of 5 per cent, although tax
reduced this to 3 per cent. The yield on the shares was close to 4 per cent.
The company also wanted to give a signal to its 400,000 shareholders that
the shares represented good value, he said.
Many shareholders in the regional companies are thought to be considering
sales after receiving one bonus share for every 10 they hold to reward them
for loyalty since flotation. Bonus certificates are being sent out this
week.
Mr Nick Pink, analyst at SG Warburg Securities, said he expected other
regional companies to follow Eastern's lead. 'The stock market is very wary
of them using surplus cash to diversify. It makes more sense for them to buy
back shares.'
Eastern is one of only two of the regional electricity companies which have
shareholder authority to buy back shares, the other being Swalec, serving
south Wales. Others are expected to seek approval shortly.

FT  18 JAN 94 / Blockbuster buys stake in Virgin games subsidiary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Blockbuster Entertainment, the world's largest video rental company, has
bought 19.9 per cent of Virgin Interactive Entertainment, part of Mr Richard
Branson's Virgin Group.
The Virgin subsidiary develops games software for the Nintendo and Sega
systems, as well as for other manufacturers. The company's recent products
include games based on the films of Aladdin and the Jungle Book.
Blockbuster will pay for the VIE stake with shares of an approximate market
value of Dollars 30m (Pounds 20m). It has also received options to buy
additional shares.
VIE, which has sold more than 13m copies of its products since mid-1990,
last year sold a 16.2 per cent stake to Hasbro, the US toy company.
It is thought that the Virgin subsidiary, which has been selling interactive
software since 1983, will eventually be floated as a separate company in the
US.
Virgin, which refused to comment on the eventual flotation, said the
Blockbuster deal would ensure its presence in the field of multimedia
entertainment. Blockbuster earlier this month announced a Dollars 8.4bn
merger with Viacom, the US cable television company which is bidding for
Paramount Communications.
Virgin said the link with Blockbuster and Viacom would mean that it could
deliver games and music videos directly to people's homes. 'This is a
building block in the multimedia world of the future. With Blockbuster and
Viacom merging to create a cable company, we could squirt videos or Phil
Collins' greatest hits down the line.'
Virgin already has a joint venture with Blockbuster, announced in 1992, to
build music megastores, which also sell games, in Europe, the US and
Australia. Blockbuster has 3,593 video stores in nine countries and 511
music outlets, including 20 megastores in the joint venture with Virgin.
Virgin said it had followed different strategies with various companies to
widen the scope of its games business. Apart from offering Blockbuster and
Hasbro equity stakes in VIE, the company had concluded licensing agreements
with the Walt Disney Corporation to turn its films into games.

FT  18 JAN 94 / US arm of Lucas to pay reparations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lucas Industries, the British-based motor and aerospace components group,
said yesterday it expected to pay reparations for supplying allegedly faulty
equipment to the US forces.
The company said a settlement was likely to avoid court proceedings over
claims that a US subsidiary, Lucas AUL, supplied defective missile launching
components and military radios that failed to meet specifications.
US prosecutors are expected to seek criminal charges in the missile case,
which US federal authorities have been investigating since 1992.
However, Lucas said the US authorities had made clear there was no link
between this case and investigations into 'friendly fire' deaths during the
Gulf conflict three years ago.
The equipment is for launching Maverick air-to-ground missiles, which caused
two of the worst incidents of the war. But Lucas said it believed that the
US Air Force A-10 aircraft involved in the incidents were equipped by a
different supplier.
Seven US marines were killed in a light armoured vehicle on January 29,
1991. On February 26, during the Allied land offensive, nine British
soldiers died when their Warrior vehicles were hit, also by Maverick
missiles.
Lucas took over AUL from private owners in December 1986 as part of a series
of US acquisitions in defence electronics. The radio business became part of
Lucas AUL in 1989.
The British group said it had been co-operating with investigations into
test procedures at the US subsidiary for the past 18 months. Many of these
procedures were already in place when it took over the US companies, it
said. The contracts with the Pentagon also dated from before the
acquisitions.
Lucas added that it had already made 'appropriate' provisions to cover
likely payments arising from the US investigations. It indicated that it
expected to reach a settlement somewhat lower than the Dollars 20m (Pounds
13.4m) which prosecutors have been reported to be seeking.
The UK group, which has defence sales of around Pounds 100m in the US, said
the 'ultimate sanction' would be to have its Pentagon contracts withdrawn
but this measure was rarely invoked.

FT  18 JAN 94 / Yeltsin 'to continue reform' without Gaidar

<TEXT>
President Boris Yeltsin yesterday accepted the resignation of Mr Yegor
Gaidar, the Russian government's leading economic reformer, but said he
would continue bold economic and political reforms in spite of widespread
fears to the contrary.
'I would like particularly to stress the unchangeability of the president's
course towards deep and democratic reform of Russian society, its economy
and political institutions,' Mr Yeltsin's spokesman said.
However, Mr Boris Fyodorov, the other prominent reformer in the government,
later announced he had been asked to stay on as finance minister but without
his present rank as a deputy prime minister. He said he was still deciding
how to respond.
But the removal of Mr Fyodorov's other title appeared to bury suggestions
that Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, prime minister, would make every effort to
retain him as a symbol of continuity for the country and for western
creditors and aid donors.
Russia's Choice, the electoral bloc led by Mr Gaidar, said yesterday that Mr
Gaidar's resignation as first deputy prime minister would help place
responsibil- ity for hyperinflationary policies and other 'dangerous'
decisions squarely on Mr Chernomyrdin.
Mr Fyodorov was also said to be considering leaving Russia's Choice. His
resignation from either the bloc or the government would leave the field
clear for Russia's Choice to go into open opposition while Mr Chernomyrdin
attempts to woo Communists, some ultra-nationalists and an ill-defined
centre ground.
Mr Gennady Ziuganov, leader of the Communist party, welcomed Mr Gaidar's
departure and said he would co-operate with any government which abandoned
policies that had impoverished the nation. His reaction was echoed by the
other powerful anti-liberal parties in the new State Duma, or lower chamber.
Mr Yeltsin is due to meet Mr Chernomyrdin today to discuss the final shape
of the government. There is now little doubt that it will be dominated by
former heads of state industry whose priority is to pump money into ailing
farms and industrial enterprises. The rouble fell to a new low yesterday in
response to Mr Gaidar's departure.
From Russia's Choice only Mr Anatoly Chubais, confirmed as deputy prime
minister to complete a privatisation programme, and Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the
foreign minister, who has adjusted his policies to growing nationalist
sentiment at home, are likely to remain in government.

FT  18 JAN 94 / Malaysian dam project termed 'abuse' of aid: Major agreed
deal against official's advice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major took the final decision to sign an aid deal with the Malaysian
government which a top Whitehall official described yesterday as an 'abuse'
of taxpayers' money.
The aid programme, to build a hydroelectric dam on Malaysia's Pergau river,
has cost the British government more than Pounds 300m and is the largest
expenditure ever incurred on a single project by the Overseas Development
Administration.
However, Sir Timothy Lankester, the permanent secretary at the ODA, told MPs
yesterday that in early 1991 he repeatedly advised ministers not to sign the
deal because the dam would be uneconomic until 2005 and would have a
detrimental impact on the Malaysian economy.
The project has since been described by the National Audit Office, the
government's accountancy watchdog, as 'a very bad buy', while Labour MPs
claim that the aid was part of an illegal deal by which Malaysia bought
Pounds 1bn of defence equipment. Sir Timothy told the House of Commons
public accounts committee yesterday: 'It was an abuse of the aid programme
in terms that it is an uneconomic project.'
He said that he had sent 'many memoranda' to Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign
secretary, not to go ahead with the project but that, in February 1991, 'the
final decision was taken in consultation with the current prime minister'.
The preliminary decision to agree a deal with the Malaysian government was
first initiated by Lady Thatcher, when she was prime minister, in the summer
of 1988.
Ministers later realised that the costs of the project were far greater than
had been incurred on any comparable ODA programme. But in a statement made
to the public accounts committee yesterday, Mr Hurd said the deal needed to
be carried through 'because of earlier commitments' that had been made.
He also said the project had led to a significant increase in UK exports to
Malaysia.
However, there have been repeated allegations that the aid programme was
linked to a decision taken by Malaysia in 1988 to buy Pounds 1bn worth of
defence equipment. A formal link between the two deals could be illegal
under the 1966 Overseas Aid Act, but ministers have repeatedly claimed that
the two were unconnected.
Sir Timothy told MPs that, as a permanent secretary, he had taken the highly
unusual step of formally overruling the deal and demanding that Mr Hurd give
him a special 'direction' to 'sign the cheques' for it.
Under that procedure, Sir Timothy would have incurred no formal
responsibility for the decision.
He also disclosed that ODA officials undertook an appraisal mission to
Malaysia in 1989 which lasted only two days. Sir Timothy said that 'a more
substantial appraisal' was required. However, ministers at the Department of
Trade and Industry had put pressure on the ODA to come to a decision quickly
because of 'the commercial and industrial context'.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Eastern Electricity's decision to buy up to 5 per cent of its shares is a
small but significant admission of the regional companies' embarrassing
riches. The RECs are heading rapidly towards net cash, and even a harsh
review of their price caps is unlikely to stop cash generation completely.
Funding utilities with equity alone is expensive. While share buy backs
help, a much more radical restructuring is needed to get the RECs back on to
a sensible footing. Interestingly, the regulator cited cost of capital as an
issue he will consider in his current price review. If the RECs do not
produce plans to gear up, return excess funds to shareholders and cut bills
to customers, the regulator may do it for them.

FT  18 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Albert Fisher
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It could almost be the old days at Albert Fisher. An ambitious management
with a strategic plan buys a US company with a patchy earnings record for a
little cash and a large deferred payment. Since Fisher suffered second
degree burns playing with that particular box of matches, it is surprising
that the new management is prepared to give it another whirl. Nor is it
encouraging to hear the acquisition described as earnings enhancing,
calculated on the initial payment only.
Fisher's balance sheet is not particularly stretched, so the full price
could have been paid now. On the other hand the company will have to
refinance its convertible shares this year, pushing gearing over 30 per
cent. Presumably a rights issue is ruled out at the current rating, so
perhaps Fisher simply wants to stay flexible. Yet if it is to finance its
ambitions to graduate from commodity apples to sliced salads it cannot do so
on the never never. The proposition that commodity risk can be taken out of
the business by going up market was always questionable. If it is to be
tried, at least the bet should be paid for in advance.

<TEXT>
Reports that the government may be prepared to invest up to Pounds 1.5bn of
public funds in the Channel tunnel rail link provide further confirmation
that a sea change may indeed be sweeping through Whitehall. Such numbers,
though, must be treated with scepticism, given that the talks between the
public and private sectors are at such an early stage. It would be bizarre
if the government chose to publicise the precise level of its funding
commitment in advance. That would only weaken the Treasury's negotiating
hand. The suspicion must be that the headline number may include the costs
the government has already sunk into Eurostar's new train sets and into
upgrading existing rail lines. It is far from clear how much new money will
be forthcoming.
However, considerable public generosity will be required to prime the pump
and entice the private sector into participating in the project. The link
may be a political imperative but the government will have to work in a
competitive global marketplace for capital and skills. Perhaps Sir Alastair
Morton's private finance working group, which meets again today, can help
ginger up Whitehall thinking some more.

FT  18 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Reuters
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Reuters is currently standing at the confluence of several investment
streams and is in danger of being swept away in the flood. The shares are
washing up against the Pounds 20 mark, which must make a share split a real
possibility. The purchase of Quotron has provided the immediate cause for
the rise. But the buoyancy of the world's financial markets and the
re-rating of media sectors on both sides of the Atlantic, thanks to
multi-media induced intoxication, provide the underlying rationale.
The cancellation rate for Reuters' trading screens has reduced as a result
of currency turmoil and surging markets. The growth of emerging economies
has also fuelled demand for new screens, helping to swell Reuters' terminal
base, which had stalled at around 200,000. Reuters is also seeking to expand
into new markets, through the provision of on-line information services to
the advertising and medical markets, although few of these projects are
likely to yield substantial returns in the immediate future.
The step-up in the rate of acquisitions and the working capital demands of
installing new screens make it unlikely that Reuters will repeat its share
repurchase scheme. The tax credits which facilitated that scheme have also
been exhausted. Reuters' attractions therefore rely wholly on its earnings
prospects, which investors have dangerously over-egged before. Still,
Reuters' rating remains well below its 1987 peak.

FT  18 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Tokyo takes stock
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The last time international investors took a shine to Japanese equities  -
towards the end of 1991 - the results were anything but pleasing, as the
market continued to slide. Two years on, foreign institutions are prepared
to give Tokyo another shot. The 17 per cent rise in the Nikkei average from
the depths plumbed in November has been fuelled by overseas buying. Taking
profits in over-heated Asian markets such as Hong Kong or Malaysia and
reinvesting in Tokyo is a common strategy.
Measured against bond yields hovering around 3 per cent the Nikkei hardly
looks stretched. But investing in Japanese equities is an act of faith. Even
if Mr Morihiro Hosokawa's coalition can push political reform through
parliament this week, there is no guarantee it will be able to agree an
economic package of stature. Three rounds of fiscal stimulus have failed to
kick-start the economy. A more imaginative approach, probably including
personal tax cuts, is required.
With Mr Hosokawa due to meet President Clinton in Washington next month,
failure to deliver a stimulus would create friction over Japan's trade
surplus. The gentle depreciation of the yen against the dollar, from Y101
last August to Y111 yesterday, has brought relief for Japanese exporters.
The stock market has been led higher by the big consumer electronics
companies, which points to selective buying of exporters. Unless Japan acts
to stimulate domestic demand, though, the US may again be tempted to talk
the yen up as a way of tackling trade.

FT  18 JAN 94 / How to get the drop-outs back in: David Goodhart examines
the UK's options for tackling unemployment among unskilled young men
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unskilled men are not wanted by UK employers. Displaced by machines, women
and the cheaper labour of workers in developing countries, nearly one in
three of them does not have a job.
Such men - and the young unskilled in particular - spoil the picture of
falling registered unemployment, which last week dipped beneath 10 per cent
for the first time in 18 months.
According to Mr Jonathan Wads-worth, an economist at the London School of
Economics, 18.2 per cent of low-skill males (with only CSEs below grade 1 or
no formal qualifications) are now unemployed compared with only 5 per cent
of graduates. But the figure for low-skill males, he says, understates the
problem as many older unskilled workers have left the labour market
altogether by, for instance, signing up for long-term sickness benefit.
Between 1977 and 1991, the proportion of low-skill men with jobs fell from
88 per cent to 67 per cent.
The extent of this collapse in demand for low-skilled men has only recently
caught the attention of policymakers; anxiety in Whitehall has been prompted
at least partly by fears that a growing, semi-permanent underclass is
fuelling rising crime.
Concern has been deepened by a belief that unskilled male unemployment is no
longer cyclical, as it has been in the past. During the 1980s experts
believed that if such workers could be kept in touch with the labour market
through temporary work schemes they would find a job when the economy picked
up.
But many of the relatively well-paid, 'good jobs' that unskilled men used to
do - in the steel industry or docks - have disappeared for good. Employment
growth over the past two decades has been in less well-paid, often part-time
jobs in the service sector. While service-sector employment grew by 22 per
cent in the 1980s, industrial employment fell by 31.2 per cent. As a result
of this switch, men are twice as likely as women to be made redundant, and
two-thirds of men made redundant are under 35, according to an Employment
Department study last week.
Displaced unskilled men are reluctant to take low-paid 'women's jobs' for
reasons of pride or because pay rates are too low to justify coming off
social security. In any case employers usually prefer to take on women,
because they are generally more productive and flexible.
At the same time, unskilled young men are finding other doors closing. In
the early postwar decades, the armed forces recruited up to 10 per cent of
16-year-old male school-leavers every year, but now take only a few hundred.
For many of the most disadvantaged young men in Britain, the army had
provided self-esteem, social skills and, where needed, high-quality remedial
education.
With conventional employment routes blocked, a growing number of young men
earns an income and gains a sense of worth through crime or drugs. 'A lot of
young men who once got their social values from the army are now getting
them in prison,' says Ms Vivien Stern, director of the National Association
for the Care and Resettlement of Offenders (Nacro).
Several US studies have established a link between rising numbers of young
males outside the labour market and rising crime. In the UK, Mr David Pyle,
a Leicester university expert on the economics of crime, says that the
crime-unemployment link is difficult to prove, but he has estimated a 10 per
cent increase in unemployment leads to an 8.5 per cent increase in burglary.
Male youth unemployment - although currently more than 20 per cent - has not
been a focus of national attention since the early 1980s, when an outbreak
of inner-city riots prompted fears for a generation of youth without work.
That is partly because absolute numbers are lower, thanks to the slower
birth rate in the 1970s, and more young people are staying on at school.
But many experts believe that the danger of long-term exclusion for these
young men is now much greater. 'A minority of young men have always been
involved in crime or antisocial behaviour. In the past they settled down
into apprenticeships, jobs or marriage, and became law-abiding citizens.
Fewer are now doing that,' says Ms Pamela Meadows, director of the Policy
Studies Institute, the UK think-tank.
Government attempts to catch the young male drop-outs have had mixed
results. Ministers want every 16- to 19-year-old to be either in full-time
education or training, or in a job leading to a qualification. Skills
training, combined with a big expansion of further education, is clearly
part of the answer when the proportion of low-skilled jobs is falling so
rapidly, from 60 per cent to 35 per cent since 1979, says Mr Wadsworth of
the LSE.
In November, the government unveiled its new apprenticeship initiative,
aimed at finding high-quality training places for 40,000 young people a year
by 1996. But Whitehall officials acknowledge that for others the two main
existing training schemes - Youth Training and Training for Work for adults
 -often provide neither adequate training nor 'real' work. Moreover, many
young people are not covered at all: a recent study by Tyneside Training and
Enterprise Council found that nearly 10 per cent of all school-leavers in
Newcastle were dropping out of the system altogether.
For this disaffected and poorly educated minority, many of the
training-linked job-creation solutions seem inappropriate, at least as the
first step, because they do not seem to lead to anything.
What are the alternatives? One option, with which the government is
experimenting in a dozen pilot schemes, is to try to price the low-skilled
unemployed into real jobs. Some of these pilots, such as the 'Workstart'
scheme, subsidise employers' labour costs, so workers can be paid a wage
that gives them an incentive to come off benefit. Such schemes are in line
with European Commission ideas for cutting employers' social security costs
for the low skilled.
Other pilots, such as the 'portfolio worker scheme', try to encourage
adjustment to the growth in part-time employment by financially supporting
unemployed workers as they build up a portfolio of two or three part-time
jobs, rather than wait for a suitable full-time vacancy. Full Employment UK,
the jobs consultancy, is working on a similar plan which will offer
volunteers three days' work a week for three months in growing small
businesses, in the hope that a proper job will be offered at the end.
An alternative, more traditional option for helping the low-skilled
unemployed is for the government to become an 'employer of last resort', by
funding infrastructure projects, such as road building. But such schemes can
be costly.
Also likely to be ruled out on grounds of expense, is a return to the 1980s
Community Programme which created 250,000 jobs a year but, because it paid
close to the rate for the job, incurred an annual cost of more than Pounds
1bn.
Nevertheless, the government is interested in less ambitious community work
schemes. A new version, Community Action, launched last year, will give
priority to unemployed 18- to 24-year-olds and hopes to provide 90,000
part-time work places at a cost of Pounds 120m a year. But it is expected to
pay a wage only a little higher than unemployment benefit, and is therefore
unlikely to fill all the places.
The problem is familiar. With most of the Pounds 2.5bn spent by the
government each year on measures for the unemployed still committed to
training schemes, the money available for the alternatives of pricing the
unemployed back into work or creating community jobs is limited.
A radical alternative being canvassed by some employment experts - mostly in
private because of the political sensitivities - is to create some sort of
'peace corps', or civilian national service, for those young people who by
choice or accident slip through the training net.
Ms Stern of Nacro agrees there is a danger of stigma becoming attached to
such a scheme if it was reserved only for people at the bottom of the heap.
But she believes there is a need for a national project which combines
discipline, self-discovery and community work, borrowing from the schemes
for inner-city youth run by the Prince of Wales' Trust.
Crucially, says Ms Stern, such a scheme should appeal to young men raised in
a tough street culture. 'Such people despise half-baked training schemes.
Far better to have something like a 'youth action force', perhaps run by a
glamorous local institution like a football club, which would inject a sense
of fun and purpose,' she says.
Though Nacro has no blueprint to offer, it has had local successes finding
jobs in the performing arts and music industries for former young offenders.
Nacro believes more imagination is required to tap the skills of young
drop-outs.
So far there is no sign of any political party backing a compulsory
programme of civilian national service. As a half-way measure, ministers
might consider withdrawing benefit from any unemployed person under 25 who
refuses to join an approved project in the voluntary sector, such as those
teaching entrepreneurship on deprived housing estates.
That too would cost money - which the government does not have. But if
ministers do not find an alternative means of intervening effectively to
equip unskilled youths with the ability to get on in mainstream society,
many of today's unemployed will become an even greater burden on government
resources later in their lives.

FT  18 JAN 94 / Leading Article: Two-speed link
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The British government's vacillation over building a fast rail link to the
Channel tunnel has given a new meaning to the term 'two-speed Europe'. When
the tunnel opens in May, trains from Paris to Calais will travel at 180mph
but complete the journey from Dover to London at about 47mph. Last year,
France's President Francois Mitterrand rightly poked fun at the UK's
slow-coach approach.
Now it appears ministers are finally prepared to commit whatever public
funds are needed to make the project financially viable for private
investment. A beauty contest to choose the private partner will start
shortly. Though the link will still not be ready until 2002, this
determination to form a genuine partnership with the private sector is
welcome.
The government's original error was to think the private sector could handle
the Pounds 3bn project on its own. Public sector funds are needed because
the link will have social benefits that cannot easily be turned into
profitable business. Active government involvement will also be vital to
overcome legislative and regulatory hurdles.
Nevertheless, the government's idea of using the private sector to build the
link was not wholly misconceived. Competitive private enterprise is better
suited to design, build and operate such projects than the public sector.
Involving private investors should also minimise the burden on the public
purse.
Ministers' current idea of a joint venture between public and private
sectors could provide the best of both worlds. But such a partnership will
not be easy to manage. For a start, government should smarten up its
negotiating act. Off-the-record suggestions that the public sector would put
up Pounds 1bn-Pounds 1.5bn are not helpful, as they could merely encourage
contractors to inflate their profit margins. The purpose of competitive
tendering should be to get the best value for money for taxpayers.
Even more tricky will be to allocate risk clearly between the public and
private sectors. Will government compensate the private partner if
legislation to authorise the link is delayed or safety regulations are
tightened? Ministers will need to answer such questions carefully if they
are to avoid destructive wrangles in the future.
Making a success of the fast rail link is not simply an important goal in
its own right. Given its status as a flagship project, it will have
repercussions for the government's wider initiative for attracting private
capital for public infrastructure. Success with the Channel link will
convince companies that they can do business with government.

FT  18 JAN 94 / Leading Article: Business and the banks
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There is always a risk in economic and financial policy that ministers and
central bankers will respond to the last crisis but one while ignoring the
signs of crises to come. The debate about the relationship between the banks
and small business in Britain is a case in point.
Bankers can never expect to be popular. But the widespread disillusionment
now felt by small business over high bank charges and high-handed behaviour
is primarily a reflection of the unusual structure of the last economic
cycle. Individual banks and bankers are no doubt at fault - there can be no
respectable excuse for charging for the bank manager's time when the client
has paid for the banker's lunch. But as the Governor of the Bank of England
rightly indicated yesterday, banks are less to blame for the troubles of
small business than those responsible for wayward macroeconomic management.
In the recession of the early 1980s big business suffered disproportionately
because a brutal monetary squeeze was administered chiefly through an
overvalued exchange rate. The non-tradeable sector of the economy, in which
the majority of small businesses operate, escaped relatively lightly. In the
latest recession the squeeze was imparted mainly through a sharp increase in
interest rates, which caused nominal house prices to fall for the first time
since the second world war. Since most small businesses in Britain are
overborrowed and their borrowings are often secured on their owners' homes,
this unprecedented double disinflationary shock was devastating.
Against such a background it is galling for small business to see banks
widening their margins as they seek to restore profitability and bolster
capital, especially in the light of the banks' high-profile lending blunders
in commercial property and elsewhere. Yet it is important to remember that
small business lending is not notably profitable for the banks. As the
governor has pointed out, the high street banks have had to provide Pounds
3bn against a small business loan book of Pounds 45bn over the past
two-and-a-half years. It is the personal customer, not small business, who
has been cross-subsidising the banks' less profitable operations in recent
years; and it is the personal customer who has recently been most heavily
mugged, as a result of mis-selling by the banks' overenthusiastic army of
pensions salesmen.
It follows from all this that the first priority in addressing the concerns
of small business should be to improve the conduct of monetary policy. The
second should be to acknowledge that the macroeconomic record in Britain
does not inspire confidence and that the small business balance sheet needs
better fire-proofing. That points to a number of long-touted remedies: more
equity, more fixed-term, fixed-rate lending in place of overdrafts that can
be withdrawn on demand and more emphasis on cash flow instead of collateral
in lending.
Much of this is happening already. The sudden end to the postwar pattern of
net disinvestment in equities by the personal sector can only be helpful: a
less institutional capital market is one in which so-called business angels
will thrive. At the top end of the scale a buoyant equity market has
facilitated a flow of fresh capital into small quoted companies. Lower down,
fixed rate lending is growing fast in the new disinflationary climate. Banks
have surplus capital and are anxious to lend again. The margins, admittedly,
look fat. But as bank profits recover, competition tends to reassert itself.
The Office of Fair Trading should be on the look out for any market failure
here.

FT  18 JAN 94 / Many hands light on work - Chris Tighe canvasses the jobless
on training schemes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Training schemes? They're crap.'
Darren Chow, 25, unemployed, father of one baby with another due in March,
is a scheme veteran: he has been on five since leaving school with two CSEs
but has never had a 'proper job'. 'At the end of the training, I just got
hoyed (thrown) back on the dole. They don't get you into work.'
Benwell, the area of Newcastle in which Chow lives, once housed thousands of
families whose male breadwinners worked at the vast Vickers engineering
complex and other heavy industrial works along the River Tyne. Today,
Vickers remains but, like most of the new workplaces along the river, it now
employs not masses of labourers but a highly trained, skilled elite.
Chow has picked up Youth Training qualifications as a painter and decorator,
a City and Guilds in catering from a year at college and a criminal record -
14 months in prison for attacking an inspector on Tyneside's Metro network.
This month he starts at a Job Club, a government-sponsored initiative to
help the unemployed find work. If it proves fruitless, he plans to return to
college for more catering training. 'I've kept out of trouble for two and
half years; I can't afford to get into trouble now with my children,' he
says. 'I'd be a better lad today if I'd got a job.'
Along the road, brothers Trevor and Phillip Donnelly, 22 and 23, are walking
home from the Netto discount supermarket. 'I've been on two YTs and three
ETs (employment training schemes) and I still haven't got a job,' says
Trevor. 'The first YT was at a butchery. They had us sweeping floors. It was
rubbish. It was six months before they'd let you scrub the blocks.'
His latest scheme gave him forklift truck-driving experience, but no job. He
has been on the dole a year. 'I might take another scheme just to get out of
the house.'
Phillip, jobless for nine months, has had one proper job - a short-term
contract as a hospital domestic. His mother fixed that up. A hospital
cleaner, she is the only one in the family of seven working.
Neither Trevor nor Phillip has ever been in trouble. 'I just sit in the
house, play the guitar,' says Phillip. 'You just get sick, bored.' After
surviving on Pounds 69 each a fortnight, they would be happy to earn Pounds
100 a week. 'I'm not asking for wads of money,' says Trevor.
Disillusion with training schemes is widespread. But Newcastle's West End
offers a scheme giving real prospects of work for unskilled men. The
government-funded Newcastle City Challenge urban regeneration initiative has
employed Larry Watt, an experienced construction project manager, to
persuade companies to which it awards building contracts to recruit local
people to work on site.
His job is not easy; many contractors believe trainees lack skills. But Watt
is dogged, and the West End trainees he offers do have skills: they have
attended a Tyneside scheme run by Jarvis, the construction company, which
offers 39 weeks of concentrated training, including site experience, in
bricklaying or joinery, and a National Vocational Qualification.
So far 50 West End men have taken up this scheme. Half are now employed and
the rest are still in training with Jarvis. For some such as 29-year-old
Steven Wilson, now on site placement and about to hear whether the
contractor is to employ him, it has helped surmount a history of school
truancy, patchy employment and a criminal record.
For others like Robert Oxley, 25, employed by a contractor improving the
West End estate where he lives, it has been the chance to gain a job and
joinery skills.
'It's up to employers to give people a chance,' he says. 'There needs be
better quality of training, and better prospects. It's no good having a lot
of training if there are no prospects at the end of it.'

FT  18 JAN 94 / Leading Article: Testing Mr Assad
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Syria, under President Hafez al-Assad, has long prided itself on
representing the true, beating heart of Arab nationalism. While the late
President Sadat of Egypt, and most recently Mr Yassir Arafat, the chairman
of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, broke Arab ranks to secure or seek
a separate deal with Israel, the Syrians remained constant in their
determination to force Israel into a just and comprehensive peace that
satisfied all Arab aspirations.
That, at least, is how the regime in Damascus has sought to portray itself.
So, when President Assad says in public, and in the presence of US President
Bill Clinton, that Syria has made a strategic choice for peace and is
prepared to establish normal relations with all its neighbours, the
international community and Israel should pay attention.
Not surprisingly, Mr Clinton and his advisers sought to place the most
positive, even generous, interpretation on Mr Assad's statements in Geneva
on Sunday. Mr Assad has not survived in the Middle East for so long without
measuring his actions and words with consummate care. But he has now said in
public what had been demanded from him by both Israel and the US, and has
thus gone some way towards answering the accusation that he was doing
nothing to prepare the Syrian people for the possibility of peace.
The price demanded by Mr Assad is, in large part, well known and formed the
basis on which Syria attended the opening of the peace process in Madrid
more than two years ago. Mr Assad will accept nothing less that the full
implementation of UN Security Council resolutions 242 and 338 which, for
him, means a total Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights seized in the
1967 war. But Mr Assad also demands an independent state for the
Palestinians and wants the Israelis to withdraw from south Lebanon. He
believes that the only durable solution is one which equally resolves all
those issues, a view echoed in Geneva by Mr Clinton.
There is but one way for Israel to test Mr Assad's statements and the depth
of his commitment to his Arab negotiating partners. And that is by
announcing a willingness to acknowledge Syrian sovereignty over the Golan
Heights, in return for a far more specific commitment from Mr Assad on the
normalisation of relations with Israel. Such a move would require a
politically courageous step from Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister.
But until he takes it, Israel's leaders cannot be sure whether another, and
perhaps the best, opportunity for Middle East peace is being allowed to go
begging.

Who says the Swiss have no sense of humour? Jean-Pascal Delamuraz, the
Euro-fanatic Swiss economics minister proves the contrary, and now claims to
have a sympathiser in heaven.
He tells of the German, Italian and Swiss foreign ministers having brief
audiences with God. The Italian asks when his country will finally be rid of
the mafia. 'It will be in 10 years,' says God. 'Oh dear, I'll no longer be
in office then,' responds the minister. The German asks when the neo-Nazis
will disappear. 'In 15 years,' intones the deity; the German minister also
regrets he won't be in office then.
The Swiss then asks when Switzerland will join the EU. 'By then I will no
longer be in office,' comes the reply.

The executive search profession was unimpressed by the first episode of the
BBC's Headhunters drama on Sunday night; TV reviewers panned it too. The
Daily Mail's said it was as 'thrilling as a tour round a processed pea
factory'. Apart from cameo appearances by Andrew Neil - editor of The Sunday
Times - and jazz singer George Melly, all the characters were a little
stiff.
But the story line - what happens when a headhunter poaches a team of
hot-shot entertainment lawyers from a fuddy-duddy law firm - is not utterly
daft.
After all, Russell Reynolds, one of the flashier international headhunters,
has just poached Roddy Gow, a former chief executive of Goddard Kay Rogers,
a smaller and more conservative firm which is still recovering from the
untimely death in an air accident of one of its founders David Kay.
Rather a case of kitsch, not art, imitating life.

Sounds like Mike Robinson, the 44-year-old chief executive of Bristol city
council, has landed one of the best-paid jobs in British housing. The
normally well-informed Housing Associations Weekly says Robinson is to head
the non-profit-making body being set up to take charge of the Ministry of
Defence's housing stock.
As usual, the MoD remains tight-lipped, but Robinson is believed to have got
the Pounds 100,000 plus job of looking after the 69,000 service homes. They
are being transferred to a private housing trust which will be more than
twice as big as the largest housing association, the North British.
The attractions for the government are obvious. It raises over Pounds 500m
and no longer has to worry about the increasing burden of making the rundown
properties fit for our troops to live in.
However, not all housing associations are going to welcome the arrival of
such a big player at a time when they are already competing for a much
smaller pot of public money. And even if the new trust is refused official
hand-outs, it will be seeking a lot of money from the City - thus crowding
out less well-connected housing bodies. Another government initiative which
has backfired?

Bang goes one of the perks of the job of being the CBI's chief economist.
The Treasury is not going to replace Andrew Sentance, the CBI representative
on its panel of independent economic forecasters, following his move to the
London Business School.
The group is about half way through its two-year term of advising Alan Budd,
the government's chief economist, and has achieved a harmony of sorts after
some initial tantrums.
One suggestion was that a new member might upset this delicate balance
especially as the next round of consultation and forecasting is due to start
early next month.
However, the CBI might reflect that it is largely to blame for losing its
place in what has been an unexpectedly influential group because it has
taken so long to find a successor for Sentance. Meanwhile, the Treasury, by
failing to appoint a talented female economist to the vacant post, has
missed a trick in its campaign to stop people referring to the group as the
'wise men'.

Those who feel that airline flights leave them feeling more dead than alive
should consider linking up with USAir, which has started a frequent flyer
programme for the existentially-challenged, otherwise known as deceased.
USAir now offers funeral directors one free round trip flight in the US for
every 30 bodies they ship on the company's flights. It's big business; no
less than 3 per cent of USAir's cargo traffic consists of the transport of
corpses. The airline - which claims to be the number one carrier to the
pension paradise of Florida - is particularly active flying the remains of
retirees back home.
The programme is part of USAir's Tender Loving Care scheme, launched last
October. It's obviously working; custom has increased by 30 per cent since
it was started. USAir, whose public relations staff imaginatively describes
this niche market as 'healthy and profitable', says it carries several
thousand bodies each month.

Sir, I can reassure both Mr I G Baillie and Mr J H Shimmins (Letters,
January 13). There will be no reduction in the number of smaller premium
bond prizes when the Pounds 1m jackpot prize is introduced in April.
The overall size of the prize fund has been increased to accommodate the new
structure for prizes in the Pounds 5,000 to Pounds 1m range. And we will
continue to pay out more than 185,000 of the smaller value prizes of Pounds
50, Pounds 100, Pounds 500 and Pounds 1,000.
So the chances of winning have not become more remote as Mr Shimmins
suggests. The odds of any single Pounds 1 bond winning a prize in any
monthly draw remain unchanged at 15,000 to one, but there will be more money
to be won.

FT  18 JAN 94 / Steering in rough seas: Portuguese prime minister Anibal
Cavaco Silva talks to David Marsh and Peter Wise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH and PETER WISE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Portugal and its prime minister, Mr Anibal Cavaco Silva, can thank the
European Union for a great deal. Financial transfers from Brussels to the
second-poorest member state (after Greece) in the last two years amounted to
about Dollars 3bn a year, close to 4 per cent of gross domestic product, and
are due to double by 1999.
The funds, designed to cushion the impact of rapid structural change in the
Portuguese economy, are rolling in at a difficult time. Mr Cavaco Silva
calls it the 'worst period' since his centre-right government took office in
1985. Under the impact of the Europe-wide recession, Portugal last year
suffered its first economic contraction for 10 years, with GDP falling by an
estimated 0.5 to 1 percentage point. Officially-registered unemployment has
risen to 6.2 per cent of the labour force, against 4.5 per cent a year ago.
At the same time, Portugal's ambition to be a fully fledged member of
economic and monetary union by the end of the century have been hit by
currency unrest and devaluation in the last 12 months.
In an interview last week in his palm tree-surrounded residence in the
centre of Lisbon, Mr Cavaco Silva, a prickly economist who is the EU's fifth
longest-serving prime minister, put a brave face on his problems. 'We have
to prepare the Portuguese economy for a new phase. It's not easy . . . This
is a real challenge. But I'm doing what I am convinced is in the interest of
the country.'
To increase competitiveness and pave the way for an anticipated 1.5 to 2 per
cent rise in GDP this year, Mr Cavaco Silva wants many Portuguese workers to
accept wage increases well below the 6 per cent inflation rate. The squeeze
is being felt above all in the public sector, where employees are due to
stage a one-day strike on January 25 to protest against a proposed wage
freeze.
The austerity is part of Mr Cavaco Silva's efforts to cut the budget
deficit, which rose to 8.5 per cent of GDP last year, well beyond the
original forecast of 4.6 per cent. Pointing to tough pay rounds in Germany,
France or Spain, Mr Cavaco Silva says: 'Look at wage costs abroad. We cannot
pay more (in percentage increases) than they do.'
Since Portugal joined the Community in 1986, it has made rapid strides to
catch up with other member states. Despite flagging output growth in 1991
and 1992, Portugal between 1985 and 1992 achieved annual average GDP
expansion of 3.7 per cent, 1 percentage point above the EU average.
Privatisation, particularly in the banking sector, has reversed some of the
state takeovers implemented by the post-revolutionary communist government
in 1974-75 - contributing to a general strengthening of government finances.
Mr Cavaco Silva pledges to continue privatisation sales, but admits the
political sensitivity of the planned sell-off in the telecommunications
sector. To guard against foreign shareholders building up a dominant stake,
the government wants to restrict the initial disposal to between 20 and 30
per cent of the single state company which will emerge later this year from
a restructuring of the three publicly owned telecommunications concerns.
With a general election due in October 1995, the prime minister faces a
testing time in the next two years. His job has been made more difficult by
a quickening in the pace of global economic competition. There are three
main reasons for this:
As a condition for part of the increase in transfers from Brussels, Portugal
has accelerated the dismantling of protection for agriculture. This has been
necessary as part of a shift towards relying more on industry. Only 12 per
cent of the labour force now works on the land, compared with 22 per cent in
1985. Competition has increased from countries in eastern and central Europe
offering low wage costs and investment opportunities for foreign companies.
Lisbon plays down the idea that Portugal is losing foreign investment to the
Czech Republic or Hungary. However, the economic threat from the east is one
reason the government rules out a firm timetable for the former communist
states to join the EU.
The relatively firm exchange rate since Portugal joined the exchange rate
mechanism in 1992 has added to pressure on companies to cut costs. Portugal
devalued the escudo twice - in November 1992 and May 1993 - when the Spanish
peseta came under speculative attack, and was forced, like most other ERM
members, to move to 15 per cent fluctuation bands in August. However, strong
foreign buying has brought the escudo back to July's level against the
D-Mark.
Declaring that industrialists can no longer rely on devaluation to boost
foreign sales, Mr Cavaco Silva says: 'The government is not going to help
inefficient enterprises to survive. They must look to new factors of
competition - not just to low wages, but to quality and marketing.'
Last month's Uruguay Round conclusion of the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade will, Mr Cavaco Silva says, intensify pressure on Portuguese
business to modernise. Towards the end of the negotiations, Portugal voiced
concern about the impact of trade liberalisation on textiles, which make up
30 per cent of its exports. However, Mr Cavaco Silva now says the trade deal
 -like the escudo policy - will have a positive impact by 'changing the
mentality of (Portuguese) entrepreneurs'.
With 21 months before the general election, Mr Cav-aco Silva's Social
Democrat party is riding relatively high in the opinion polls, even though
it won only 34 per cent of the vote in December's municipal elections.
Mr Cavaco Silva brushes aside signs of tension with Mr Mario Soares,
Portugal's veteran Socialist president, who has started a well-publicised
offensive against the government's economic and social policies. Mr Cavaco
Silva - well aware that Mr Soares' is a largely honorific office - suggests
the criticism has been stage-managed by the president's Socialist
'entourage'.
He professes no great desire to take over from Mr Soares at the next
presidential election in January 1996. He does, however, say he will stay on
as prime minister only if his party wins another absolute parliamentary
majority in October next year. He would have few qualms, he claims, about
returning to university: 'I liked my job as a professor.'
If he remains at the helm, steering Portugal through the next phase of
European integration to the end of the century will be an arduous task. The
country has to reform its economic structures with redoubled energy.
Otherwise, as Europe's centre of gravity moves eastwards and northwards,
Portugal will again suffer from its location on Europe's south-west
periphery.

FT  18 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Bond scheme could remove 'black hole'
of CAP spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr TERRY WYNN, MEP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your headline, 'Steichen says no more farm reform needed' (January 7),
is misleading and worried those of us who would like to see a more radical
reform of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). The Commission may feel that
the cereals sector should not need further adjustment before 1996 but the
sugar, wine and beef sectors will need to be reformed before then.
It is not even clear whether we can pay for the existing reforms and the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade-imposed price reductions within the
current legally binding agricultural spending ceiling. The Brussels European
summit of December 1993 said clearly that if Gatt put further pressure on
the reformed CAP, it would take the necessary steps (namely, to compensate
farmers for price reductions) while respecting the decisions of the
Edinburgh Council to stay within the agricultural guideline (the legally
binding budgetary ceiling). We need to ask ourselves what 'taking the
necessary steps while respecting the guideline' means.
It can only mean one of two things. Either member states take the money from
their own pockets and therefore begin to re-nationalise the CAP, which would
be unthinkable, or they accept a way of re-reforming the CAP which does not
break the budget. The only way to do this is through compensation in the
form of one-off, transferable bonds, which would compensate for price
reductions and give farmers a time-limited, annual income or a lump sum
allowing them to invest or diversify. Either way they could plan for the
future. Economists have calculated that this would save the EC budget Pounds
3.8bn a year.
European taxpayers are paying Pounds 28bn this year for the CAP. It would be
better spent on proper food, rural, and environment policies. The 'bond'
scheme is the mechanism which can lead towards this, and free us from the
black hole of CAP spending.

FT  18 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Franc zone move will hit public
investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr J TOPOROWSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your excellent report on the CFA (Communaute Financiere Africaine)
franc devaluation ('IMF persuades French Africa to go for growth', January
13) omitted two important points in the franc zone devaluation debate.
First, the fixed exchange rate against the French franc was originally to
provide monetary stability and relatively low prices for imported investment
goods.
In contrast to the rest of Africa, the zone has achieved a record of
remarkable monetary stability. It is unfortunate that successive French
governments preferred to stock their ex-colonies with arms and kept in power
elites which preferred relatively cheap imported luxury goods to
industrialisation.
Second, with African franc zone countries now committed to orthodox
'adjustment' policies, it is highly unlikely the International Monetary
Fund's grip on public finances will allow public investment on a sufficient
scale to secure sustained economic growth. The temporary economic
accelerations the World Bank and IMF have managed to engineer in Ghana and
Nigeria were obtained in part because they were able to export to erstwhile
hard currency markets in neighbouring franc zone countries. In addition to
the inflationary shock that franc zone countries will experience, their
neighbours will suffer from reduced regional export markets. Economic
stagnation in west Africa will exacerbate tensions in its embryonic economic
union Ecowas (Economic Community of West African States).

FT  18 JAN 94 / It is a moral issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Douglas Hurd would do us all a service if he could overcome his natural
shyness and get to know Mr Michael Portillo. The foreign secretary and the
chief secretary to the Treasury meet one another in cabinet, and presumably
elsewhere, but they are not close friends. Perhaps they should be. They are,
after all, both Conservatives.
They are not alike. There is no meeting of minds. In a continental European
country they would belong to different parties, the senior of the pair
perhaps a Christian Democrat, the junior more probably a liberal
nationalist. One difference is of particular importance. Mr Hurd will be 64
in March. Mr Portillo is nearly a quarter of a century younger. The former
has had one shot at the prime ministership; the latter is still preparing,
ever more assiduously, for his own climb up the greasy pole.
They do, however, have one thing in common. Unlike the general run of their
colleagues, both are men of substance. Few would disagree with this
characterisation of the foreign secretary. Many remain to be convinced that
Mr Portillo deserves his reputation as a class act. He is, it will be
objected, untested. He has not yet been put in charge of a large spending
department. True, but he stands out as more able, more coherent, than many
who have.
This is of some importance. Where there is so much dross, every glister of
true metal, however dim, is valuable. Britain's cabinet is exceptionally
undistinguished. You do not need all the fingers of one hand to number the
ministers who deserve to be taken seriously. Ask senior officials and
players of the political game to suggest who does and you will find that Mr
Portillo and Mr Hurd very nearly complete the list. That is one good reason
to promote a discourse between them, but there is another.
Politics everywhere has become debased. Many of its practitioners are
adrift, cut off from intellectual, ideological, religious or ethical
moorings. Parties of the left are floundering just as much as those on the
right. Like the Conservatives, Labour exists only to seek office. This is
most obviously a consequence of the collapse of communism, but the roots of
the problem go deeper. The discipline of what was once called political
economy, and is now described as economics, has become amoral, a series of
algebraic abstractions designed by the most expensive witch-doctors in
history. The more abstruse their equations, the less they tell us.
This would have horrified Adam Smith, who was a professor of moral
philosophy, or John Maynard Keynes, whose principal purpose, like that of
Karl Marx, was to improve the condition of society. It might have troubled
F. A. Hayek, whose morally driven deconstruction of collectivist modes of
thought laid the foundations of late 20th century anarchic individualism.
All would doubtless have felt obliged to agree that while cash flow is fine
on paper, we carry something more in our hearts. If there is public disquiet
at the political process it may be because economics has failed us. The cult
of the customer has begun to be seen as imperfect.
Neither Mr Hurd nor Mr Portillo would pretend to be qualified to make up for
deficiencies in the theory of contemporary capitalism, but both have the
merit that they appear to be aware that something is missing. 'Right across
the democratic world,' said Mr Hurd on Friday, 'there is a feeling that
politicians have lost touch with those whom they serve.' He instanced Italy,
France, Germany, Japan, Canada the US and even Britain as countries in which
this mood could be detected. 'Tories are not simply interested in piling up
wealth in individual pockets,' he asserted at another point in his speech.
'Our policies aim to improve the well-being of individuals and families, but
also of the community as a whole.' The Labour party could promise no less.
Mr Portillo seeks to fill in the blanks by proclamation. 'Our mission must
be to rebuild national confidence and self-belief,' he said on Friday. 'We
need to assert the value and the quality of the British way of life and of
British institutions.' A cynical poison had been spread by pessimists. Too
many politicians, academics, churchmen, authors, commentators and
journalists exhibited the symptoms of what the young pretender called a 'new
British disease' - the 'self-destructive sickness of national cynicism'. The
result was loss of respect for the crown, the Church, Parliament. If these
were not respected neither would be 'law, judges or policemen, nor
professors nor teachers nor social workers, nor bosses, managers or
foremen'.
The standard-bearer of the Tory right was not at his most prudent when he
penned those words. It was his heroine, Lady Thatcher, who aimed the
fiercest arrows at the bishops; she, it seemed at the time, who controlled
royal tours; the erstwhile prime minister herself whose rule by overwhelming
majority diminished the House of Commons.
During the 1980s Thatcherites de-professionalised the professors, destroyed
the sense of vocation of teachers and nurses, and poured scorn on social
workers. The civic infrastructure was systematically destroyed; anything
with a tradition was regarded as a vested interest to be 'taken on' and,
ultimately, 'privatised'. The gods in the Tory right's political pantheon
infected the decade with the false belief that everything good is bought and
sold, while nothing that does not have a price is of value.
Now that same rightwing faction is panicking. What has happened to the
nuclear family? To responsibility? To reverence for authority? 'Social
disorder follows when respect breaks down,' said Mr Portillo. He might more
accurately have said that, if for 14 years you preach disrespect for
everything save the profit and loss account, the result is the 1990s. Mr
Hurd knows better. Why he hangs in there as foreign secretary is a mystery.
Doubtless he is motivated by an old-fashioned sense of duty. He should try
to convey the wisdom of his years to Mr Portillo. They could arrange a quiet
dinner, and a long talk into the night. They will not invent a new form of
capitalism that is less nihilistic in its effect than the extreme
Anglo-American smash-everything model, but, together, they might begin,
however dimly, to comprehend the problem. We could then start moving again,
in the only direction available to us: forwards.

FT  18 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Right balance for investment
regulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MICHAEL BRYANT and Mr MARK RITTNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It is all too easy to accuse the life industry, particularly the
Prudential and now Standard Life, of rocking the Personal Investment
Authority boat and consequently its efforts to achieve effective regulation
of the retail investment sector. A row about whether industry interests, or
consumer interests, should have a majority on the new PIA board may seem to
many to be akin to the 'angels dancing on a pin' debate.
But the dispute is a symptom of a wider industry concern: either investment
regulation is on a statutory basis in the UK, with proper reporting and
accountability to Parliament, or regulation should be by the industry itself
 -it is already paying for it - with the ability for consumers, and their
representatives, to criticise publicly, and have unrestricted access to the
Securities and Investments Board, if they believe that the industry's own
attempts at regulation are ineffective.
An eminent retired civil servant, Sir Kenneth Clucas, with no axe to grind,
concluded that a self-regulatory body with a balance between product
providers, independent advisers and consumers, with no one sector having
predominance, was in the best interests of retail investment regulation. He
came to that conclusion in the knowledge that the primary regulator, SIB,
already had a majority of public interest members and, at the end of the
day, SIB is the ultimate arbiter of self-regulating organisations'
developments.
It is Andrew Large, the SIB chairman, who has chosen to overthrow this
delicate balance which is a fundamental constituent of self-regulation
within a statutory framework.
So it is not Jim Stretton of Standard Life who is upsetting the regulatory
applecart: he is merely pursuing the logic of self-regulation and
emphasising that Mr Large's course has no ultimate destination other than
statutory regulation with accountability to Parliament.

FT  18 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Company bidding to run national
lottery 'truly independent'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Sir CHRISTOPHER BENSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Lex asks if Ladbroke Group can disinterestedly 'run betting shops,
football pools and the lottery' ('National lottery', January 11). Quite
simply, the answer is yes. Ladbroke will be only a one-third equity investor
in Games for Good Causes, the consortium company established to bid for the
main operator's licence of the national lottery. The company is truly
independent and free-standing, with no managerial or operational
relationship with Ladbroke or Vernons and with strong representation from
non-executive directors to emphasise our commitment to Cadbury
recommendations on corporate governance.
Our approach is wholly consistent with the tone and content of indications
given by both government and the regulator with respect to the structure of
ownership and control of any prospective operator.
The particular contribution of Ladbroke, in terms of the extensive knowledge
and experience available within Vernons Pools as a result of successfully
running regulated mass market games in the UK, represents a unique and
directly relevant attribute which has been incorporated into our bid
proposals.
Should we be successful in our application, the consortium company will then
be obliged, under its licence commitments, to operate effectively and
responsibly and, in particular, to compete strongly against a variety of
existing forms of consumer spending, of which certain betting and gaming
activities form only a part.

FT  18 JAN 94 / Arts: Belated homage to a fallen star - William Packer pays
tribute to the troubled genius of John Minton
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
John Minton was always something of a star. His rackety Soho life through
the 1940s and '50s, his heavy drinking and frustrated homosexuality, to say
nothing of his final despairing act of suicide in 1957, have all combined to
confer a certain tragic glamour upon him.
He was only 40 at his death, yet by then his work was in all the collections
and it has continued as a staple of the modern British market. It would be
wrong to think of his reputation as having sunk into obscurity, in need of
rescue and revival: re-assessment, yes indeed; restoration, no.
The only real surprise is that we have had to wait so long for any proper
retrospective study of his achievement. Why this should be the case, and why
such a show was not put on long ago by the Tate perhaps, or the Arts
Council, is another story, albeit the neatest paradigm of curatorial
prejudice and received wisdom in 40 years. It is enough, for the moment, to
be thankful for the initiative of the admirable Oriel 31 Davies Memorial
Gallery of Newtown in mid-Wales in prompting this elegant, celebratory
selection of paintings and graphic work made by Dr Frances Spalding,
Minton's biographer, and showing at the Royal College of Art in London.
The circumstances of the life are, for once, very much to the point,
although the work must be trusted to speak for itself. His more mundane
commitments, to teaching and to commissioned illustration and design, have
their own story to tell.
Here was an artist as conspicuously successful as any of his contemporaries,
and with private means. The Royal College is the perfect place for this
celebration of his life's work, for he taught in the painting school up to
the time of his death. It would seem that he continued there by choice
rather than the necessity that, historically, has forced so many British
artists to teach for a living. Did he need the social community and
reassurance of the college to keep him going, to tell him he was not a
failure?
The trouble is that after a time, for a true artist at least, teaching may
come to fuel those very doubts and insecurities it once helped to assuage,
deflecting him from that central activity to which he urges others on so
persuasively, resolving his own ambition vicariously in youthful successes.
Anything is better than settling down in the studio, alone, to resolve the
impossible. Meanwhile his students seem set on the rejection of all he
believes in. By the mid-1950s abstract expressionism was sweeping in from
New York, setting Minton at the college in famous confrontation with the
likes of Richard Smith and Robyn Denny. Students sometimes seem a ruthless
and ungrateful lot.
Minton's illustration, advertising and graphic work gave him his wider
audience, and here again the effect upon him was similar, if not quite the
same; a willed device to keep him from the work that was properly his own,
the creature of someone else's deadline. His graphic facility was as
impressive as it was distinctive, his decorative judgment impeccable, his
imaginative illustration full of life and wit - the show's lower gallery is
full of it.
Yet to turn there to the handful of life drawings, that we might expect to
be the purest, most basic demonstration of his gift, is to be disappointed.
The accuracy of hand and eye is undoubted, and yet there is a quality to it
not of easy command and engrossed observation, but of stylistic
self-consciousness, mannered and inhibited.
Upstairs with the paintings, the case is more varied but essentially the
same. Just as with the draughtsman, we find a painter of manifest gifts, who
at intervals produced works of idiosyncratic beauty and true authority. The
design is always sound, the drawing strong, the painted surface always rich
in substance and never dull.
Here indeed is a substantial body of work, yet there is to it, for all its
qualities, a sense of irresolution and distraction. A theme is taken up only
to be left off, a manner adopted only to be abandoned. Brave gestures are
made, none braver than the late essays in latterday history painting in the
grand manner, the Death of Nelson and the Gamblers at the foot of the Cross.
Failures they may be, but bravely so and better than many a lesser painter's
masterpieces. It was Turner's lasting ambition, too, to be remembered as the
greatest of History Painters.
This is all most difficult, as though Minton is to be celebrated by the very
quality of his failure. Should he have reconciled himself to a career as a
graphic artist? Of course not. Should he have stuck to the darkly
Chirico-esque neo-romanticism of the deserted wartime street-scapes by which
he first became known, or his later, brighter, more-mannered Cornish
harbours and Thames-side wharves? Well, an artist must grow. What about the
portraits and full-length figures in the studio? Of their kind, that of the
critic, Neville Wallis, is the most accomplished, that of Kevin Maybury, the
most formally complex and psychologically intense he ever did.
Would that there were more. Who can say he should have done less teaching,
or that his work would have gone further without it? There are those who
require conflict and frustration in their lives and work. The tension
manifest in everything he did is what makes Minton the truest neo-romantic
of them all. It is only his premature death that we should regret.

FT  18 JAN 94 / Arts: Prokofiev's 'Fiery Angel'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Among the many artistic effects of glasnost, few have been as extraordinary
as the way in which the Kirov Opera has been galvanising opera worldwide.
Not only has the Kirov company made influential tours to London, New York
and other Western cities, but its individual members are also making regular
appearances with Western troupes. And, with their help, certain Russian
operas are becoming more widely known in the West.
Prokofiev's Fiery Angel is a case in point. Suddenly it has become the
property of Galina Gorchakova and Sergei Leiferkus. They performed it at the
1991 Albert Hall Proms, and again in 1992 in David Freeman's staging - a
co-production between Covent Garden and the Kirov. The central role of
Renata is notoriously taxing, but it has become Gorchakova's international
calling-card. After she and Leiferkus sang Renata and Ruprecht in London -
conducted, both at the Albert Hall and at Covent Garden, by Edward Downes -
they sang it in New York as part of the Kirov's 1992 season at the Met, with
Valery Gergiev conducting. Now, in a new production by Giancarlo Cobelli,
conducted by Riccardo Chailly, they are singing it at La Scala, Milan.
Let me say at once that I doubt whether any lesser singers could keep me in
an opera house for the length of this awkward opera. The Fiery Angel - or
L'Angelo di fuoco - is on one level a drama of remarkable psychic
possession; Renata and Ruprecht are like characters out of Dostoyevsky. On
another level, however, it is terribly static. And the musical modernism of
Prokofiev's vocal writing, though always intense and alert, is strangely
externalised. We want to enter the nervous systems of the haunted Renata and
her obsessively loyal knight Ruprecht, but the music keeps us out.
Cobelli's La Scala staging could hardly be less like Freeman's. The basic
story is told in terms of fairly straight-forward realism in the front half
of the stage, while distant visions show the symbolic characters of whom we
hear: the fiery angel, Renata herself as a young girl. Gradually, the real
and unreal worlds become more and more mixed and confused.
I am grateful for the degree to which the story's basic historical setting
is maintained - nor do I miss those lumbering acrobats, covered in talc, who
so percolated Freeman's staging. (Freeman, however, achieved greater force
in the final scene, when the nuns start baring their breasts. Cobelli's nuns
wear artificial bosoms: which one observes with altogether greater
detachment.) But the opera itself lacks moment-by-moment dramatic tension,
and neither staging can solve this problem.
Chailly's conducting is of the highest order, combining power, intensity and
beauty. Every vocal line is clear and the international cast is fused into
an impressive ensemble. Leiferkus, with his wonderful blend of virile
integrity and stern psychological force, remains an ideal Ruprecht. And it
is a thrill simply to hear the exceptional clarity of his diction. You feel
that no other singer in the world could make so much simply from singing
Renata's name; he gives it ardour and urgency, while at the same time
enouncing it as firmly as if he were engraving it on marble.
As for Gorchakova, I am as obsessed with her as Ruprecht is with Renata. Her
voice is huge, dark and heroic; and, as she wields it in marvellously
sweeping phrases, it makes an incomparable effect in a large opera house. I
use the word 'incomparable' advisedly; never in live performance have I
heard a voice that has so excited me. I hope that La Scala soon can hear her
in other Russian roles.
And, remembering that Leiferkus is now as well known here in French and
Italian music as in Russian, may we hope that we can soon hear Gorchakova
sing Verdi? She has sung Trovatore and Force of Destiny in Russia. Glasnost
should work two ways. These Russians singers have much to reveal to us of
their own heritage, but the Western repertory can help reveal them yet
further, both to us and to themselves.
Prokofiev's L'Angelo di Fuoco, sung in Russian, continues in repertory at La
Scala until January 28

FT  18 JAN 94 / Arts: Old Master sales set the auction houses off to a good
start
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If optimism is the life blood of the art market, 1994 got off to the perfect
start in New York last week when Old Master pictures, not the easiest
objects to sell to the uncultured rich, did remarkably well. Christie's sale
brought in Dollars 15m. (Pounds 10m.) and was 90 per cent sold, with a still
life by Van Huysum far exceeding its Dollars 1.5m. estimate at Dollars 2.6m.
Sotheby's did equally well. There were doubts about the the late Peter Jay
Sharp's collection, not about the quality but the fact that Sharp had bought
them in the previous ten years to furnish his Park Avenue apartment and
consequently they were not entirely fresh on the market. In the event
connoisseurship told, and 68 of the 77 lots offered sold, for a collective
Dollars 19.3m, with less than 5 per cent bought in by value.
The general Old Master sale at Sotheby's on Friday totalled Dollars 13.7m
and was 75 per cent sold. A view of the Ducal Palace in Venice by Canaletto
made Dollars 1.4m as against an Dollars 800,000 top estimate, and a view by
John Cleveley the Elder of Royal yachts on the Thames at Greenwich sold for
Dollars 552,500, a record for the 18th century artist and way ahead of the
Dollars 150,000 top estimate.
DeDe Brooks, the new chief executive at Sotheby's, said yesterday that the
company had returned to profit in the final quarter of 1993. The year's
turnover of Dollars 1.3b was still well below the record Dollars 2.9b of
1989 but the corner had been turned. The strong demand for jewels was a key
factor. They contributed Dollars 200m as against Dollars 260m for the
traditional money maker, Impressionist and Modern art. In 1989 jewels were
worth Dollars 150m. and Impressionist and Modern pictures Dollars 800m.

FT  18 JAN 94 / Arts: Carmina Quartet ripens nicely - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Since its formation ten years ago the Carmina Quartet, basically Swiss but
with a fine American violist, has won steady European acclaim - rare for a
young team in the hallowed string-quartet medium. While the players still
counted as very young, they seemed impressively mature for their years: not
always a good prognosis for later. But the quartet's Wigmore Hall recital on
Saturday, slightly uneven, was greatly encouraging; there was a new
sophistication in its playing, and a febrile new intensity.
It sounded like a not-quite-mature quartet intent upon developing its early
promise into something far richer. A splendid Viennese programme was on
offer: Berg's early, superb op. 3 Quartet (atonal music, but not
'twelve-note') flanked by late Haydn and by Schubert's last, incomparable
work in the medium, D887 in G major.
In the so-called 'Emperor' Quartet from Haydn's op. 76 set, the Carmina
maintained a narrow-gauge precision and delicacy. If there was a perceptible
debit in the jovial-grandeur department, its taut counterpoint held the ear
continuously; and the famous variations on the 'Emperor's Hymn' were treated
as private musings, almost prayerful, taking the closest care with Haydn's
almost-Wagnerian harmonies. It was no surprise, then, that the quartet could
focus Berg's Expressionist chromatics to such electrical purpose. There, I
missed only some broader trailmarks (even at his most intricate, Berg
signposts his music with big gestures) and some extra muscle for the fraught
rhythmic motifs.
With the grand Schubert G major there was suddenly a new, resplendent
Carmina sound. In the context it felt like switching into Cinemascope and
stereo - a public world, not a private one; and yet there were marks of the
players' tenderest attention everywhere. Their performance was crowned by a
Finale that seemed to race brilliantly, insouciantly along, but with the
undertone of harried desperation that other late Schubert finales carry (cf.
above all the 'Great' C major Symphony): something that cannot be faked
histrionically, and only makes itself felt in a rigorously faithful
performance.
One anxious reservation: the Carmina leader must look to his pitch, for it
was worryingly hit-or-miss whenever his part ascended into the ledger-lines.
More than one British quartet of distinction has had an inspirational leader
who blotted its copybook just so, at some real disadvantage to their
collective careers. Chamber-music aficionados tend to have keen ears; one
evening's encounter with casual mistuning can put them off forever.

There is endless bluster in the argument between Britain and China over the
hand-over of Hong Kong, but it is difficult to understand what sort of
constraint the blusterers imagine Britain might employ if we don't get our
way. Should we send a gunboat? Threaten economic sanctions against the 1.2bn
Chinese? Perhaps Brian Barron's report in Assignment will make everything
clear (7.45 BBC2).
The opening programme in C4's series Undercover Britain was a brave but not
wildly dramatic expose of the exploitation of some domestic servants:
employers who don't always say 'Please' may be unpleasant but it is hardly
the end of the world. This week's exercise reports on badger baiting (9.00).
Today's 40 Minutes sounds like one of the less solemn editions of this
series. It is concerned with human hair: those who have it, those who don't
and some who seem to but are borrowing other people's (9.50 BBC2). In
Network First the Duchess of York joins a party of mentally disabled
climbers in the Himalayas (10.40 ITV).

Forte has appointed Patrick Copeland as group director of its hotels.
Copeland, 49, begins work immediately, but his first task will be to help
his new employers buy additional hotels rather than run the ones they have.
Forte is in the midst of an attempt to acquire the right to manage the
Italian-based Ciga group of luxury hotels. The negotiations are at a
delicate stage; Forte has teamed up with George Soros's Quantum Fund in an
attempt to conclude the deal.
Copeland's position does not give him a seat on the main board. He joins an
operational committee, the hotels and restaurants board, on which Rocco
Forte, the group chairman, also sits.
Before joining Forte, Copeland was president of Cinema International
Corporation, the international film distribution and marketing joint venture
owned by MCA/Universal and Paramount Studios. He spent much of his career
with Grand Metropolitan, including a spell as chief executive of
Intercontinental Hotels Worldwide, and replaces Alan Hearn, who becomes

FT  18 JAN 94 / People: Change of chairman at Ashley
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
James White yesterday strongly rebutted the notion that he has been forced
out of his post as chairman of the Ashley Group, which manufactures window
blinds, despite the announcement that he will be making way for Hamish
Grossart after the next board meeting on February 7.
Grossart - described as 'an excellent fellow' by White - is chairman of EFT,
Quality Care Homes and Scottish Highland Hotels. It is understood that
Grossart had been in discussion with the board of Ashley Group for some
weeks before the announced board changes.
White, 56, will remain on the board of the Ashley Group until the end of
February. Tony Orton and Peter Maydon, who serve as non-executive directors,
will also retire then.
The Ashley Group currently has some Pounds 19m of outstanding debt, and it
has yet to settle legal problems relating to the sale of Digsa, the Spanish
food retailing chain it first bought in 1988 and which it sold in May 1993.
'There has been no quarrel,' says White. Despite rumours to the contrary, he
ascribed his departure from the board as the culmination of a process 'that
goes back 15 months', involving the relocation of the company's HQ to
Glasgow. He says: 'Despite being Scottish by origin I have spent 33 years in
the south, and the company needs on-the-spot management.'
White, a former chairman of Bunzl, is also a non-executive director of Lucas
Industries. Bill Macdonald becomes managing director and Robert McNeil
deputy chairman with immediate effect, and John Langlands finance director
with effect from February 14.

FT  18 JAN 94 / Business and the Law: Guarantees can be restricted -
European Court
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Companies selling luxury goods under guarantee in the European Union are
entitled to restrict guarantees to those goods sold through a European
Commission-approved selective distribution network, the European Court of
Justice ruled last week.
The case concerned the sale of Cartier watches sold via selective
distribution networks organised around distributors selected according to
qualitative criteria. The distribution agreements made between Cartier and
the distributors were found by the Commission not to fall foul of Rome
treaty competition rules.
A dispute arose between Cartier and Metro, a German cash and carry chain.
Metro was not an approved Cartier distributor, but nonetheless had sold
Cartier watches bought from third country markets such as Switzerland for
several years. Under Swiss law, approved dealers in selective distribution
networks cannot refuse to supply non-approved dealers.
Cartier watches are sold with a manufacturer's guarantee. However, the
guarantee will only be honoured if there is proof on the guarantee
certificate that the watch was bought from an approved distributor. Metro
claimed such a restriction was contrary to EU competition rules and brought
an action before the Dusseldorf courts, seeking a declaration that Cartier
was lawfully bound to honour guarantees for watches sold within the Metro
network.
After a long series of hearings, involving two appeals to the Court of
Appeal, the lower court referred the issue to the European Court. Under
German law, the main issue was the effectiveness of the distribution
agreement. The Appeal Court had ruled that the restrictions under the
selective distribution agreement relating to guarantees would only be valid
if the agreement was totally effective, in other words was capable of being
completely respected.
The question that was therefore asked of the European Court was whether the
validity of a selective distribution agreement in terms of EU competition
law was put into doubt by the fact that the agreement in question was not
wholly effective in countries outside the Union, thereby leading to a
situation where supposedly protected goods were freely available to
non-authorised dealers for eventual sale within the EU.
The European Court found that the principle which had evolved under German
law, but was practically unknown elsewhere in the EU, did not necessarily
imply that contractual validity was dependent on the total effectiveness of
the obligations in question.
It pointed out that if the validity of selective distribution systems were
submitted to this principle, then the paradoxical result would be that the
most rigid agreements would be treated more favourably than the more
flexible agreements which allowed for parallel trading.
Given that, and the fact that in some member states the application of such
a principle is prohibited, the Court said that a selective distribution
agreement, such as the one in question, was not put in doubt because it was
not totally effective in countries outside the EU.
The Court also examined the question of the validity under EU competition
law of restrictions placed on the grant of guarantees for watches sold by
agreed distri-butors.
The Court first found that a contractual obligation limiting the grant of
guarantees to approved distributors and thus withholding such guarantees
from non-authorised distributors had the same effect as the contractual
restrictions limiting the sale of the products to the approved distributors.
Given that the contractual obligation undertaken by the manufacturer only to
sell the relevant products to approved distributors was legally valid, as
well as the obligation undertaken by the approved distributors only to sell
the products to consumers or other approved distributors, the Court found
that there was no reason to submit the restrictions placed on the grant of
guarantees to a more onerous and strict legal regime.

HSBC Asset Management, the fund management arm of Britain's biggest banking
group, has had to cross the Atlantic to find a new chief investment officer.
Paul Guidone, 36, joins HSBC next month from the Prudential, the US
insurance giant.
For the past three years Guidone (right) has been managing director of
Prudential Diversified Investment Strategies in New Jersey and before that
had worked on the fund management side of the Union Planters banking group
in Tennessee and New York's Equitable Life. During his time at PDI he
doubled the assets under management to Dollars 17bn.
Guidone's post at HSBC is a new one and his arrival marks the completion of
the recruitment of a new management team which began with the arrival of Tim
Ferguson, a former chief executive of County NatWest Securities. Kevin
Gregory, a former finance director of Mountleigh, was recruited to be
finance director and John Bradell was brought in from Storehouse to be group
marketing director.
HSBC Asset Management manages Dollars 28bn of funds and is an amalgamation
of Marinvest, in the US, James Capel Asset Management Group, in the UK and
Europe, and the Wardley Investment Services companies in the Asia Pacific
region.

FT  18 JAN 94 / Business and the Law: Confusion over contracts - Draft
legislation threatens another row in the UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK's Department of Trade and Industry finds itself under fire again over
plans for implementing another piece of European legislation: this time, on
consumer contracts.
The row comes just as the dust is beginning to settle after eleventh-hour
changes were made to the UK commercial agency rules, which left British
companies only 10 days to renegotiate their agency agreements.
The European Directive on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts, which must be
incorporated into UK law by the end of 1994, is designed to extend the
protection of consumers against unfair attempts by suppliers of goods and
services to exclude, or limit their liability to, areas not covered by
current UK legislation.
The extension of the unfair contract terms regime to insurance and financial
services contracts, and to contracts for land in particular, will force
businesses in those sectors to make a time-consuming and possibly expensive
review of all their standard terms and conditions.
Consultation on the draft regulations, which will bring UK law into line
with Europe, ended last Friday. In theory this should leave the DTI
sufficient leeway to produce a final draft in time for businesses to carry
out an orderly review of their consumer contracts before implementation. But
lawyers and consumer organisations fear that the draft regulations are so
flawed and in need of clarification that another fiasco, similar to that
over the commercial agency regulations, cannot be ruled out.
At a general level there is concern that, rather than replacing the rules in
the 1977 Unfair Contract Terms Act (UCTA), the new regulations will run
alongside the current regime. Ms Samantha Mobley, a solicitor with the City
law firm Baker &amp; McKenzie, says the wisdom of this approach is questionable.
'At a time when the government's buzz-word is deregulation, it makes no
sense to impose an additional layer of regulation to existing legislation,'
she says.
Consumer organisations agree. Ms Rebecca Evans, the Consumers' Association's
consumer lawyer, says having two regimes running side-by-side will confuse
traders and consumers. The law will have to be consolidated at some stage,
but it is now clear that the government cannot introduce primary legislation
to replace the 1977 act in time to meet the December 31 deadline.
Consumer organisations are also concerned that the DTI proposes to ignore
enforcement measures set out in the directive. The directive requires
European Union member states to ensure that 'adequate and effective means'
exist for the control of the use of unfair terms in consumer contracts.
Those means must include the granting of legal rights to persons or
organisations with a legitimate interest in protecting consumers - in other
words, consumer organisations must be allowed to bring representative
actions in the courts on behalf of consumers.
This is a dilemma for the DTI, as representative actions are contrary to the
English law principle of privity of contract. The DTI's solution to this
problem is to opt out of this part of the directive. But, again, lawyers
cast doubt on the wisdom of this approach.
The Consumers' Association, the Office of Fair Trading and the National
Consumers Council have all pointed out to the DTI that, because of the
supremacy of EU law over national law, the government cannot ignore part of
a directive that is mandatory.
The European Commission in Brussels has told the Consumers' Association
that, if the UK government fails to provide for representative action in the
regulations, it will take infraction proceedings against the UK at the
European Court in Luxembourg.
According to Ms Evans, consumers need the remedy of representative action.
UCTA has been little used, she says, because consumers are deterred by the
risk and expense of taking court action. 'There should be a power for
consumer organisations to take up the cudgels on behalf of all consumers.'
The other concerns with the draft regulations centre on lack of clarity.
They will, for example, introduce the concept of 'unfairness' into the
English law of contract for the first time. UCTA imposes a general
requirement that exclusion clauses are only valid if 'reasonable'. According
to Ms Mobley, lawyers assume the English courts will interpret the concept
of unfairness as equating with reasonableness under UCTA, but this is not
certain.
She and other lawyers feel the DTI should make this issue clear by spelling
it out in the regulations so that businesses, particularly those with
consumer contracts that have hitherto been exempt from unfair contract terms
rules, will know what standard they are measuring their contract conditions
against when they review them.
In other respects the draft regulations appear to go beyond what the
directive requires. The directive states that it covers terms in contracts
for the supply of goods or services between the supplier and the consumer.
But according to Mr Norman Starritt, a partner of London solicitors Charles
Russell, the DTI's draft regulations do not expressly require that the goods
and services are supplied to the consumer. The regulations would therefore
appear to apply the fairness test not just to contracts for the supply of
goods and services, but also to certain ancillary contracts. These could
include the terms of any standard bank guarantee by a wife of a bank loan to
her husband's business, or a parent's guarantee of a finance lease for a
young person to buy a car.
But it is in the extension of the unfair contract terms regime to sectors
currently exempt, such as contracts for land, insurance and financial
services, that these uncertainties and flaws in the draft regulations are
likely to cause the biggest headache.
The extension of the regime to the financial services industry represents a
substantial departure from the current position under UCTA, where contracts
for the creation or transfer of securities or of any right or interest in
securities are exempted from regulation.
Mr Peter Richards-Carpenter, a partner of Baker &amp; McKenzie, says it is clear
the DTI does not intend the regulations to apply to the creation or issue of
financial securities, as the issuer of a financial security is neither
selling goods nor supplying a service; the security is simply evidence of
indebtedness. But the regulations will apply to the secondary market and to
relations with brokers, to the retail products market and to all other
transactions that manifestly involve the sale or supply of goods, such as
contracts for the issue of commodity futures and options.
The extension of the concept of unfairness to such contracts threatens a
period of uncertainty for the industry. There is bound to be confusion in a
number of instances on what is meant by an unfair term in relation to
financial services contracts, Mr Richards-Carpenter says.
The draft regulations, for example, state that a term will be regarded as
unfair and therefore unenforceable if it causes a 'significant imbalance' in
the parties' rights and obligations arising under the contract to the
detriment of the consumer. It is not clear whether taking a security over
assets would be regarded as unfair, because it gives a right to the provider
on non-performance of the contract by the consumer but no similar right to
the consumer for non-performance by the supplier. Such matters will have to
be tested, he says.
Amid all this uncertainty, one thing is clear: the DTI will have to work
hard to iron out these difficulties if another embarrassing row with
business is to be avoided.

Templeman was until the end of last year an under-secretary at the Inland
Revenue, most recently in charge of the Financial Institutions Division.
He joined Schroder as a director at the start of January, and replaces Eric
Henbrey, who will retire in June as head of the tax department.
Henbrey himself joined Schroder from a job as an inspector of taxes in 1966,
at which time he says there was just a 'trickle' of Revenue staff moving
into the private sector.

UK solicitors' monopoly on the conduct of litigation is under threat from a
new professional body aiming to corner a share of the construction
litigation market. The Institute of Commercial Litigators was formed by five
international firms of construction consultants that already handle
arbitration work - James R. Knowles, Cyril Sweett, Bucknall Austin, Beard
Dove and Tweeds. The institute has applied to the Lord Chancellor's Advisory
Committee for the right of its members to conduct litigation. It plans to
offer clients a faster, cheaper service undercutting solicitors' fees by up
to 50 per cent.
Institute director Patrick Lineen said: 'There is little difference between
complex arbitration and complex litigation.'

to China - Legal Briefs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The former Hong Kong-based steel mill, Shun Fung Ironworks, has won a record
HKDollars 700m in damages from the Hong Kong government in compensation for
the compulsory purchase in 1986 of its Junk Bay site to make way for a new
town. The company had originally claimed HKDollars 1bn for relocating its
business to China and for loss of profits. In June last year the Hong Kong
Lands Tribunal awarded Shun Fung just HKDollars 131m. But the Hong Kong
Court of Appeal overturned the judgment. The court criticised the tribunal
for taking 22 months to hear a case which should have lasted one month and
for producing a 899-page judgment 'full of confusions'. It said Shun Fung
was entitled to relocate
its business and the award was too low.
A delighted Mr Anthony Wood of McKenna &amp; Co, Shun Fung's solicitors, said
the longest hearing and the longest judgment in Hong Kong had now produced
the highest ever award.

FT  18 JAN 94 / Management: A helping hand with BS 5750 - In a Nutshell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
With larger companies increasingly only dealing with suppliers that have
adopted the BS 5750 quality standard, smaller companies may be facing an
inevitable increase in their overheads.
Whatever the benefits might be, BS 5750 can be expensive to implement and
maintain for smaller companies. This may put pressure on the British
Standards Institute to modify the standard for smaller companies.
To discuss the increasingly pressing issues behind BS 5750 and quality, the
Small Business Research Centre at Kingston University is holding a
workshop of consultants, academics and lobby groups on February 16.

FT  18 JAN 94 / Management: Let your pension buy an office - In a Nutshell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The pension industry may be under siege, with the Securities and Investments
Board estimating that more than three quarters of people who took out
personal pensions since 1988 were given 'inadequate advice'.
But there is at least one benefit available that may have been largely
ignored.
According to Personal Pension Management, part of Provident Life,
businessmen and women can use their own pension funds to buy an office for
their businesses.
Their businesses then pay a 'rent' to the pension plan, rather than to a
landlord. The property is sold on retirement and any profit is put into the
pension.
These so-called Self-Invested Personal Pension Plans (SIPPs) are little
known, partly because they are not attractive sales for pension salesmen
working on commission. But they can produce substantial savings for groups
of individuals, such as partners in the same firm, PPM says.

FT  18 JAN 94 / Management: The shape of things to come - The venture
capital industry is lobbying for a better deal on investment trusts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Britain's chancellor announced in his November budget that he would
introduce new venture capital investment trusts, a buzz of excitement spread
through the investment and small business community.
Taken with the new Enterprise Investment Scheme, which replaces the Business
Expansion Scheme, and changes to rules on capital gains tax roll-over
relief, the government at last appeared to be addressing the problems of
private investors who fund smaller companies.
But, as ever, the devil is in the detail. With a consultative document on
the new investment trusts due out at the end of the month, there is some
concern that the Inland Revenue will bind them with overly restrictive rules
to avoid the kind of shenanigans that marked the last years of the BES.
Granted, the future salesmen of the new trusts have an interest in sounding
gloomy to tease more concessions from the government. But even taking their
comments with a healthy pinch of salt, there appears to be a real concern
that tax breaks alone may not make the scheme sufficiently attractive to
justify the high risk of investing in unquoted companies.
Professional investors say excessive Inland Revenue caution could jeopardise
the best attempt any government has yet made to reduce the shortage of
investment capital that has dogged small and medium-sized companies since
the 1930s.
For unquoted companies, properly structured trusts would hold the promise of
an increase in the supply of venture capital. For investors, they would open
up an area of investment that is currently dominated by professional
investors.
The specific attraction for investors in the new style venture capital
investment trusts (VCITs) is that dividends and capital gains on holdings
would be paid free of tax. In this way they would be similar to Personal
Equity Plans.
So what elements does the Association of Investment Trust Companies say need
to be included to make VCITs attractive?
At the time of the budget, the Inland Revenue said a 'substantial
proportion' of the VCITs' assets should be held in unquoted trading
companies. The AITC says this proportion should be 70 per cent - although
the Inland Revenue may be thinking of a higher level. The 30 per cent
balance should be either shares in companies that have gone public after
being held as unquoted investments, the proceeds of sales, or uninvested
cash, the AITC says.
It calls for a relatively long three-year period in which to invest the 70
per cent. And it says trusts should be allowed a generous period in which to
reinvest proceeds of realisations.
'If the venture capital investment trusts became forced sellers (when one of
its investments floated) it would become something of a dampener on the
share price,' says Ernest Fenton, director-general of the AITC.
Crucially, professional investors want recognition that companies seek
funding though a package of financial instruments and do not only want
equity. The AITC and the Inland Revenue appear to agree that qualifying
investments should include loan stock, mezzanine debt instruments,
preference shares and warrants as well as equity.
The AITC firmly believes there should be no limit to the size of the
unquoted company in which the VCITs can invest. 'There is just as much of a
funding gap for larger unquoted companies,' says Fenton.
If investment is restricted to the smallest companies, venture capital
managers might be loathe to launch a trust.
'If the rules for venture capital trusts say we can only invest in very
small companies - ie with sales less than Pounds 1m - we would not be
interested (in setting up an investment trust) and I don't think many people
would be,' says William Eccles, a director of Foreign &amp; Colonial Ventures
which manages a quoted venture capital trust.
Finally, the AITC says it expects the 22 existing venture capital trusts -
with assets of about Pounds 1.6bn and a market capitalisation of about
Pounds 1.3bn - to be allowed to qualify. But it expects that less than 10 of
the existing trusts would qualify under its suggested criteria.
There appears to be considerable common ground between the AITC and Inland
Revenue on the above points. Where they are more likely to part company is
over what the AITC says is necessary to make the trusts attractive enough to
generate investor interest.
'With venture capital you get into illiquid situations,' says Fenton.
'Without further incentives it will be difficult to market these things.'
Among the additional incentives he would like to see are:
Capital gains roll-over relief on profits made on other investments -
whether the sale of ICI shares or a second home - if the profits are
invested in venture capital investment trusts. This postponed CGT liability
to be waived entirely if the investment in the trust is held for five years.
No maximum limit to the amount of investment any individual can make, or a
high limit of at least Pounds 100,000. Investor prudence, the AITC says, is
likely to provide a natural limit. Any losses to be offset against income
tax, as was the case with the Business Start-Up Scheme which preceded the
BES.
Striking the right balance between making the scheme attractive and avoiding
abuse will be a delicate task. The quoted venture capital trusts have had a
poor record relative to the FT-All share index over the last 10 years -
although the category did outperform the Footsie in 1993. Too many
restrictions would not entice investors to risk investing in unquoted
companies, even indirectly, through investment trusts.
But there is a risk if the government makes the regime too liberal. 'The
scheme may get distorted again into a purely tax-saving device and will not
help back smaller companies,' says Eccles.
