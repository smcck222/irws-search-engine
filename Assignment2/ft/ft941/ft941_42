FT  18 JAN 94 / Management: Thin pickings may provide food for thought - The
BES's record is likely to hang heavily over efforts to promote interest in
the Enterprise Investment Scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
It should have been such a jolly event. After nearly six years as investors
in a Business Expansion Scheme that funded the Deals restaurant chain,
shareholders were attending the opening of a third outlet, a finely
converted building in Hammersmith, west London.
But despite the presence of Lord Lichfield, royal photographer, and the
Queen's nephew, Viscount Linley - both large investors in the BES - a cloud
hung over proceedings.
The free champagne at the launch party is about the only return Deals
investors have seen so far. Several have begun to ask - some rather
forcefully - when they might get their money back. And what about a
dividend? With admirable stoicism, one shareholder summed up the extent to
which expectations had slipped. 'At least Deals has survived.'
While this hardly smacks of an ambitious investment target, survival is
indeed an achievement. The fact is that of the 1,300 publicly-funded trading
companies set up under the BES scheme, less than 20 per cent have so far
returned any cash to investors, according to John Spiers, editor of BESt
Investment, which monitors and evaluates the schemes.
It is a record that will hang heavily over efforts to interest investors in
the replacement for the BES, the Enterprise Investment Scheme, announced in
the last budget by Chancellor Kenneth Clarke.
But the record is not entirely bleak. Those who invested in schemes between
1983-85 on the whole got back their gross investment and the benefit of tax
breaks, according to Spiers. But those who invested in the next three years
fared much worse as the recession swept many companies away.
Nevertheless, the successes are notable. The films Leon the Pig Farmer and
Henry V were both critically acclaimed as box office successes and should
give a handsome return to their investors. Takare and Associated Nursing,
two healthcare companies now quoted, also started as BES schemes.
Shares in Resort Hotels, by contrast, are now suspended having been
successfully floated. And Graham Wood, a structural steel producer, went
bust in 1992, although not before it had given its original investors ample
opportunity to sell in the market.
Of the 20 BES companies listed, only about half have survived, according to
Tim Villiers, of the BES Association.
Broadly speaking, the finance bill published last week suggests the new EIS
scheme will be modelled on BES legislation but will remove the opportunity
to invest in property ventures like the assured tenancy scheme.
The legislation remains fiendishly complicated, accountants say, but there
are some positive changes. Investors will be allowed to take an active and
paid role on the boards of the companies in which they invest, bringing in
valuable expertise.
Second, the up-front tax break for the new EIS has been cut to 20 per cent,
though capital gains and dividends are free of tax.
While this is less generous than the 40 per cent tax break allowed under the
old BES, it may mean investors in future take a far closer look at the
underlying investment. Trading company BES schemes were too often supported
for the tax incentives alone.
But the EIS is generating less interest than the Venture Capital Investment
Trusts, announced in the budget (see above). According to Charles Fry, of
Johnson Fry, one of the largest sponsors of BES schemes, the EIS is unlikely
to raise more than Pounds 50m in its first year.

FT  18 JAN 94 / Technology: Europe's newest interpreter - A computer system
which makes decisions based on constantly changing variables
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What do a London-based cancer research fund, Greek tourism, French aerospace
and pollution in Venice have in common?
All four are guinea pigs in a new project, partly funded by the European
Union, to develop a ground-breaking computer-programming language to help
decision-making where thousands of constantly changing variables are
involved.
The four ventures are part of a research project under the EU's Esprit
information technology initiative, combining state and private-sector
bodies. The three-year Ecu3.5m (Pounds 2.7m) venture, now at its half-way
stage, brings together the Munich-based European Computer-industry Research
Centre (ECRC), a joint venture between ICL (British-based and
Japanese-owned), Bull of France and Germany's Siemens, with a variety of
state and private-sector end users.
Sophisticated computer software to process long strings of information in
parallel, as opposed to one piece of data after another, is nothing new. In
meteorology, supercomputers work round the clock to predict weather
patterns, based on huge quantities of data on wind speeds, atmospheric
pressures and a plethora of other variables.
However, computer-based weather forecasting largely involves processing
complex mathematical formulae, explains Alex Herold, a group leader at the
ECRC. What is different about the new venture is that it combines four
distinct types of software writing to produce a result which is closer than
any predecessor to logical human thought. 'Hence the name: Applause -
Applications and Assessment of Parallel Processing using Logic,' he says.
The new language differs from existing products in that it is designed not
only to absorb vast amounts of data, but also to interpret them and draw
appropriate conclusions.
Applause involves combining four programming technologies - logic
programming; constraint programming (in which various conditions are
imposed); parallel processing and database connection - to produce a
high-level programming language for very high performance computers.
If the ECRC cracks the nut, a vast range of applications could unfold. The
new language could assist any group confronted with thousands of variables
and the need for very fast processing to reach real-time decisions based on
potential changes between the factors involved.
If the project succeeds, it would embody the lofty aims of the controversial
Esprit scheme - into which large amounts of money are being pumped by the EU
and individual information technology companies - to marry pure
university-based research with potential commercial applications.
For their work to bear fruit, the Munich researchers must not only develop a
suitable language, but also show that it has practical uses. Only by
developing the software alongside realistic applications can the scheme
realise its full potential. And potential users must be persuaded that the
new language is effective if they are to have the confidence to take it up
for themselves.
Hence the four very different ventures with which the ECRC researchers are
collaborating. All are in different parts of the EU, helping to counter
criticisms that Esprit is tailored exclusively for the EU's richer northern
members. The projects also deliberately cover different disciplines, even if
the underlying software is the same, to build confidence in the new
technology being developed in Munich.
In London, the Imperial Cancer Research Fund is working with the ECRC to use
the software for research on protein synthesis. 'The molecular biologists
and physicists in London are trying to predict the structure of proteins,'
explains Herold. If it works, the software should help the laboratory
researchers analyse how protein molecules react under different
circumstances.
In Athens, the ECRC is working with Expert Systems International, a Greek
software specialist, the Greek National Tourism Organisation and the
University of Athens, to create a database and decision support system for
visitors. Tourists will be able to combine information about their holiday
time, budget and preferences with a vast domestic database.
The co-operation with Dassault in France could hardly be more different. At
the aerospace group's Toulouse works, the project is being tailored to the
needs of a busy aircraft production line, where engineers and production
staff need to work on advance scheduling for future manufacturing needs.
In Venice, the ECRC is co-operating with Systems and Management, a leading
Rome-based software house, to help design a new system for the city's water
authorities to control pollution in one of the world's most beautiful, but
also most contaminated, lagoons.
The relationship between the Venice-based water magistrature and Systems and
Management, predates Applause. The software house had already been working
with ICL on a new language for banking software in high-performance
computing. Separately, in 1991, the magistrature's anti-pollution chief,
Giorgio Ferrari, received long-awaited funding to compile a voluminous
database on the possible sources of pollution in the shallow, overcrowded
lagoon.
'Although everyone complains about the pollution in Venice and the lack of
action, the first laws recognised the need for action back in 1936,' says
Ferrari. 'The problem is that although the law appears very rigid, there is
an ample margin for error. We needed an instrument which would help us
decide if an emission could be damaging, even if it was below the legal
limit, because of its potential impact with other substances in the lagoon.'
Before suggesting changes to the legislation, let alone taking draconian
steps such as revoking licences for local industry, Ferrari needed a
database cataloguing levels of pollution, its sources and the type of
emissions pouring into the waters.
The team has already completed its 'census' of potential pollutants in Porto
Marghera, the big industrial complex near Mestre, Venice's industrial alter
ego on the mainland. Attention has now switched to Venice itself and the
neighbouring island of Murano, famous for its glass-blowers. Both are huge
hazards. 'People forget that in Venice we have no drains,' points out
Ferrari. That means vast quantities of human waste flow into the lagoon
every day, alongside other residues from the thousands of service industries
such as hotels and restaurants which make up Venice. Murano adds other
pollutants such as lead and arsenic, widely used in the glass industry.
The database will be supplemented by frequent chemical analysis of lagoon
water and by a handful of automatic pollution sensor stations now operating
experimentally. More automatic sensors would improve the coverage, but their
installation remains prohibitively expensive, says Giuseppe Sardu, one of
the research directors at Systems and Management.
Huge processing power is required to handle the quantity of information in
the database, and information from the regular water samplings, and take
into account the hydraulic effects caused by the heavy tidal action in the
lagoon.
Once the data has been collected, Ferrari will use it alongside the new ECRC
software. Combined, the two systems should make it possible to forecast
pollution patterns and take decisions on any issues related to water
pollution by simulating the potential environmental impact.
Combining the new software with the established database 'will help us
decide on granting future licences to businesses and, possibly, on revoking
authorisation for others seen to be creating unmanageable pollution', says
Ferrari. No software currently on the market meets such complex needs, he
adds.
If the research proves successful, it is precisely such a commercially
viable product that the ECRC hopes to create. Says Sardu: 'We are already
looking at other applications, and have identified transport fleet
management as one area with considerable potential for the new language,
although full-scale commercial exploitation is still probably two to three
years off.'

FT  18 JAN 94 / Technology: Catching up with bio reactions - An instrument
which speeds up experiments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A new instrument, which follows the progress of biological reactions as they
happen, promises to transform procedures in biomedical research.
Arnold Coffer, who runs the Imperial Cancer Research Fund's protein
isolation and cloning laboratory in London, says Fisons' IAsys biosensor
allows him 'to obtain within minutes information that would previously have
required days of experiments with dozens of test tubes, using radioactive
tracer reagents'.
IAsys owes its existence to a Pounds 620,000 innovation grant from the
Department of Trade and Industry, which partially funded its development
during the late 1980s.
The project involved two UK companies, Fisons and Plessey, with Cambridge
University's Institute of Biotechnology as the academic partner. Fisons
assumed full responsibility for commercialising the research in 1990, after
Plessey's takeover by GEC, and set up a new biosensor company within its
scientific instrument division.
David Fortune, managing director of Fisons Applied Sensor Technology, sees
the project as a classic example of the role government support for
pre-competitive research can play in bringing an important new technology
into existence. Plessey's Caswell research centre contributed its expertise
in transducers and opto-electronics, the Cambridge group its knowledge of
biological surfaces and Fisons its experience in instrumentation.
'The collaboration was essential because Fisons entered without any know-how
in biosensors apart from some scientific dabbling in the mid 1970s,' Fortune
says. 'We wouldn't have been prepared to go into such a speculative new area
if the DTI had not paid half the costs of our working with Chris Lowe and
his group at Cambridge.'
Fortune believes Fisons has emerged with a world-beating technology which is
potentially valuable to about 40,000 laboratories involved in medical,
pharmaceutical and biological research.
'Many hundreds of labs are looking in detail at this technique,' he says.
IAsys can be used to investigate interactions between almost any pair of
biological molecules, including antibody-antigen, protein-protein and
ligand-receptor binding. Pharmaceutical researchers seeking a molecule to
fit into a particular receptor site on a cell can measure both the speed
with which candidate drugs bind to the site and the strength of the
resulting bond.
Coffer's lab is using IAsys for several research projects. One example is
the evaluation of new compounds which block the action of oestrogen hormones
as treatments for breast cancer; the scientists make copies of the protein
that serves as the oestrogen receptor in human cells and then see how
strongly different candidate drugs bind to it.
'I don't think one machine will be sufficient here, now that word is getting
around about what it can do,' Coffer says. 'Maybe two or three would satisfy
the requirements of the ICRF.'
The basis of IAsys is 'optical evanescent wave technology'. In brief, it
uses light to follow the reaction between a pair of compounds. One is
immobilised on the surface of the instrument's transparent cell, which is
coated with dextran gel. A tiny drop of the second chemical is then added.
Any reaction between the two compounds changes the optical properties of the
dextran gel. The instrument detects this by shining a laser beam on to the
surface and measuring the light reflected back.
The only competition to the Pounds 50,000 IAsys is a more expensive optical
biosensor developed by Pharmacia of Sweden, Fortune says. 'It is quite a
heavily patented area and we do not anticipate any further competition for
at least the next three years.'
IAsys will not produce revenue quickly enough to rescue Fisons from its
present financial troubles, but it is just the sort of development the
company needs to return to long-term growth and prosperity.

FT  18 JAN 94 / Airports handle record numbers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fresh evidence of recovery in business and leisure travel came yesterday
with annual traffic figures showing UK airports handled a record number of
people last year.
BAA, the airports group, said passenger numbers at its seven airports,
including London Heathrow and Gatwick, increased 5 per cent last year
compared with 1992 to a record 80.8m. This followed a 6.6 per cent increase
last month over the same month in 1992 when the seven airports handled 5.7m
passengers.
Heathrow saw passenger numbers rise 5.9 per cent to 47.6m last year, while
traffic at Gatwick grew only 1.1 per cent to 20m. This reflects the change
in the London air traffic distribution rules which has led to several
international airlines switching to Heathrow.
Traffic at Stansted increased 14.5 per cent to 2.7m passengers last year,
while the number at Glasgow rose 7.4 per cent to pass the 5m mark for the
first time.
Last month Stansted recorded the strongest growth of 24 per cent compared
with December 1992.
Overall traffic on UK domestic routes rose by 6.4 per cent last month over
December 1992, while the charter market was 7.2 per cent higher. North
Atlantic traffic rose 4 per cent last month while other long-haul traffic
rose 12.4 per cent.

FT  18 JAN 94 / Oil helps industrial output return to pre-recession levels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A sharp increase in oil and gas extraction in November helped bring overall
industrial production back to pre-recession levels, while official figures
published yesterday also pointed to a quickening of manufacturing output.
The Central Statistical Office yesterday reported a 0.4 per cent increase in
seasonally adjusted output in the production industries in November to show
a 3.9 per cent rise on November 1992.
Manufacturing output increased by 0.3 per cent in November and was 2.5 per
cent higher than in November 1992.
Taking three months' figures, considered by the CSO to be a more reliable
guide, overall industrial production increased by 1.2 per cent in September,
October and November compared with the previous three months and was 2.7 per
cent up on the three months to the end of November 1992. Manufacturing
production rose 0.8 per cent in the latest three months compared with the
June-to-August period and was 1.8 per cent higher than in the three months
to November 1992.
The coming on stream of new oil and gas fields as well as cold autumn
weather, which boosted demand for gas and electricity, lifted the production
industries output index to 100.2 in November.
This was its highest level since July 1990, on the eve of the recession, and
slightly higher than the average for 1990 that now serves as the index base.
Manufacturing accounts for nearly 85 per cent of the production industries'
output, which also includes mining, quarrying, oil and gas extraction and
electricity, gas and water supply.
Oil and gas extraction in November was 24 per cent higher than in November
1992. It jumped by 5.8 per cent between October and November, to come close
to its previous record output of May 1987. Oil and gas extraction in the
three months to November was up 2.6 per cent on the previous three months
and 15.8 per cent up on the three months to November 1992.
Output of the electricity, gas and water supply industries was 4.5 per cent
higher in the three months to November compared with the previous three
months and 4.7 per cent up on the same period of 1992. CSO statisticians
said that some 3 percentage points of the growth in electricity and gas
supplied in the latest period reflected the effects of unusually cold
weather in October and November.
Manufacturing output between October and November was boosted by a jump in
chemical production and a rise in tobacco output ahead of the November 30
Budget.
The latest three-month figures pointed to strong output growth in the oil
refining, computer and electronic components industries and in the
production of building materials and vehicles. However, output declined in
older industries such as shipbuilding and mechanical engineering.
CSO statisticians warned that the latest 0.8 per cent three months on three
months increase in manufacturing output could give too favourable a picture
of UK production trends. The late spring bank holiday depressed output in
the three months to the end of August.
Nonetheless, they estimated that manufacturing output was growing at an
underlying annual trend rate of 1.5 per cent in November against 1 per cent
in the previous month while the trend growth rate for the production
industries as a whole was 2.5 per cent.
Other figures released by CSO and the Department of Employment yesterday
revealed a slight upturn in manufacturing productivity growth to 3.6 per
cent in the 12 months to November from 3.3 per cent in the year to October.
However, the year-on-year growth of manufacturing output per head slowed to
3.8 per cent in the three months ended November from 5.3 per cent in the
three months to the end of August.
Unit wage costs in manufacturing rose in the three months ended November,
the first such rise last year.

FT  18 JAN 94 / Business groups welcome Bank's initiative
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lobby groups broadly welcomed Mr Eddie George's call for banks and smaller
businesses to work on improving their understanding of each other's needs.
The Confederation of British Industry, which has 250,000 members, mostly
small companies, said the Bank governor's study would raise the quality of
debate on an issue which was of crucial importance to the economy.
The CBI agreed with the Bank's assertion that smaller companies were far
from blameless and needed to look beyond the traditional overdraft for
long-term financing.
Mr Stan Mendham, chief executive of the Forum of Private Business, which
represents 21,000 smaller companies, said Mr George was acting like a
'super-ombudsman' for smaller businesses. 'The governor has changed the
relationship between banks and their smaller business clients.'
Mr Ian Peters, CBI deputy director for small companies, said surveys of CBI
members showed banks were becoming more responsive to small businesses but
had some way to go.
'The banks have concentrated too much on security-based lending and they
have not based it sufficiently on future cashflow and business plans,' he
said. But smaller businesses were too often comfortable using overdrafts as
a source of long-term finance, and needed to be more willing to issue
equity, and raise finance through factoring, leasing and term loans.
The lobby groups said the government had already gone some way towards
increasing the supply of equity to unquoted companies with the launch of the
Enterprise Investment Scheme and Venture Capital Investment Trusts announced
in the November Budget.

FT  18 JAN 94 / DTI helps to finance late payments to construction industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Department of Trade and Industry is helping to finance measures to
combat late payment in the construction industry, Andrew Taylor writes.
The department is giving Pounds 30,000 to the Federation of Master Builders,
which yesterday launched a code of practice for its 17,500 members to
encourage them and their customers to pay on time.
The federation provides a telephone hot-line to members seeking legal advice
on how to recover money they are owed. It also offers a credit check service
in association with Infocheck, which allows companies to investigate the
payment record of prospective employers, main contractors and
sub-contractors.
Under the voluntary code of practice, members will be expected to agree
payment terms before signing contracts and honour these agreements.
Lord Strathclyde, minister for small businesses, welcomed the code and urged
other trade bodies to follow the federation's example. The grant runs until
November.

FT  18 JAN 94 / George calls for a cut in recriminations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, put it last night,
improving the financing of Britain's 2.5m small companies is 'an amorphous
sort of problem'.
The Bank's paper, following its inquiry among banks and small business
groups last year, does not propose any simple solution. Instead it argues
that the two sides have more in common than is generally thought, and should
work to improve understanding further.
Mr George last night rebutted the notion that banks are to blame for the
55,000 failures among small businesses each year. He argued that a more
stable economy 'would go a very long way to reducing the tensions that have
grown up'.
He had been encouraged by the amount of agreement in spite of the
'exaggerated expectations' of some small businesses and 'insensitivity' of
some banks. The debate should be 'carried forward in a constructive way,
with rather less mutual recrimination'.
The conclusion that the two sides should talk to each other more is
uncontroversial. But Mr George seems to have decided that someone should say
it.
The exercise can be seen as part of Mr George's effort to establish
independence from the Treasury. By setting its own terms, the Bank has
distanced itself from inquiries into loan margins ordered in 1991 and 1993
by Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor.
The Bank reaches seven conclusions, which it says are its own rather than
agreed principles. But it nevertheless tried to ensure that they were backed
by banks and small companies. It held a meeting of all sides last month to
discuss a final draft.
The paper's conclusions are:
Banks are committed to the finance of small business, and are trying to
provide alternatives to lending through overdrafts. Other forms of financing
include medium-term and long-term loans at fixed and floating interest
rates. Bank managers will have to be better trained to assess the right mix
of finance.
Most small companies accept the need to improve financial and management
skills. According to one estimate, just 10 per cent of very small businesses
produce adequate accounts. Some banks may consider offering better terms to
small businesses with well-trained managers.
Late payment of bills remains a significant problem for many small
businesses and may lead to them collapsing. A change of business culture is
needed, and both banks and small companies increasingly support a statutory
right to interest on unpaid bills. The government is consulting on this now.
There should be measures to encourage equity investment in small companies.
Banks may find this costly because of the management expertise required, but
venture capital companies and 'business angels' should be encouraged. A
replacement for the Unlisted Securities Market could be 'valuable'.
There are worries about the impact on small businesses of new legislation
such as the Consumer Credit Act and changes in the insolvency rules. Banks
have argued that if their claim to assets in insolvencies is weakened, this
will make them less likely to lend to small businesses.
Small companies have particular difficulties entering new export markets.
This may be helped by selling unpaid debt at a discount through methods
including factoring and invoice discounting.
All parties involved in the discussions accept that banks are not public
utilities, and need to 'price risk realistically'. The risks and costs
associated with small business lending are relatively high.
One difficulty with these principles is that they are not worded precisely
enough to form targets. Although the British Bankers' Association emphasised
yesterday that the proportion of fixed-term lending was rising, its leaders
said this figure could not be used to measure future progress.
This means that the problem may not only be amorphous, but have an
intangible solution. Mr George appears to think that the initiative will be
judged by whether public acrimony between banks and small businesses has
eased when he re-examines the problem later this year.

FT  18 JAN 94 / Exports up as regions report improved trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT and CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Export orders for east Midlands companies have started to rise again after
declining during the summer, the Association of East Midlands Chambers of
Commerce said yesterday.
The survey was published as the latest report on business performance in
north-east England and Cumbria recorded, for the fourth quarter of 1993, the
highest ever positive balances for home sales, home orders and profits since
the survey began in mid-1990, before the recession hit the area.
In the latest survey of business performance at 353 companies in the east
Midlands, the chambers found 36 per cent of companies reporting an increase
in export orders in December, compared with 27 per cent in September and 38
per cent in June.
But the level of domestic business appears to have flattened out after a
surge of orders last spring. The chambers said 40 per cent of companies had
bigger order books in December than three months before, compared with 42
per cent in September and June and 28 per cent last March.
The east Midlands data illustrate the uneven spread of recovery. Last week,
the west Midlands chambers reported a fall in the number of service
companies increasing export orders, and a small rise in manufacturers with
higher export orders.
However, both regions have large amounts of unused capacity. The east
Midlands chambers reported that 32 per cent of companies were operating at
full capacity, 4 percentage points higher than September but 8 percentage
points lower than June.
Last month, 59 per cent of companies were expecting a rise in turnover, but
only 45 per cent expected a rise in profitability. The main concern of
companies remained a cut in interest rates, the east Midlands chambers said.
Meanwhile, Business Survey North, the quarterly report by the Northern
Development Company, the region's economic regeneration body, said most
companies in north east England and Cumbria appeared to have put recession
behind them. The report was produced in association with the Teesside and
Tyne and Wear Chambers of Commerce.
Following two successive quarterly falls, export sales and orders were up,
plant and machinery investment reached a new peak and training expenditure
rose sharply, in response to continuing skills shortages.
The survey is based on responses from 744 companies, 40 per cent of them
manufacturers. Of the respondents, 21.7 per cent were running at over 90 per
cent capacity, compared with 27.5 per cent in the previous quarter.

FT  18 JAN 94 / Footwear workers set for 2.2% rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wages in footwear manufacturing are set to rise by 2.2 per cent in March,
following an agreement between the British Footwear Manufacturers Federation
and the KFAT footwear and clothing workers' union, Paul Cheeseright writes.
The rise, announced yesterday, is in line with lower settlements. The
Confederation of British Industry said that in the three months to November
average pay rises among manufacturing companies were 2.2 per cent, compared
with 3.9 per cent in the third quarter of 1992.
Union members will be balloted on the deal. Mr David Lambert, union general
president, said he doubted whether there could be further gains by
negotiation.
The rise, covering the 20,000 union members, will be influential in
settlements for the rest of the industry. Pay levels have been set against
the background of harsh competition for the industry, where employment has
fallen by about 10 per cent over the last year.
Retailers are threatening to buy from importers in order to persuade
domestic manufacturers to hold down prices.

FT  18 JAN 94 / High Christmas sales confirmed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first hard evidence that shops and supermarkets enjoyed their best
Christmas and new year since the economy went into recession came in a
survey published yesterday.
Sales volumes increased in December and in the first five days of this month
at the highest year-on-year rate since April 1990, according to a
Confederation of British Industry distributive trades survey.
Mr Sudhir Junankar, the CBI's deputy director of economic affairs, said:
'The optimism among retailers before December proved to be justified last
month. But it is likely that the buoyancy of trade was in part due to keen
pricing by retailers in the run-up to Christmas which successfully attracted
consumers into the high street.'
The survey showed that the rise in sales was broad-based, with only
off-licences reporting volumes down on a year ago. The most notable gains
were recorded by chemists and grocers, with footwear and leather retailers
and booksellers and stationers also reporting above average growth.
Furniture and carpet stores reported modest increases in sales compared with
a year ago.
The balance of retailers reporting an increase in sales compared with a year
ago, less those reporting a decrease, was 34 per cent compared with 23 per
cent in November and minus 4 per cent in December 1992.
But the CBI warned that the rate of sales growth was expected to moderate in
the early part of this year. Expectations for this month were the weakest
since May last year.
Official retail sales figures tomorrow are expected to confirm the pick-up
in consumer spending in December.
Wholesalers were surprised by an increase in sales volumes that was
substantially higher than expected. Orders placed with wholesalers'
suppliers also increased strongly in the year to December, although stock
levels were considered to be excessive.
Christmas results for car traders were less encouraging. Sales last month
were down slightly on a year ago, although the CBI expects a return to
year-on-year growth for traders this month. The expected increase in sales
is the strongest since March last year.
The survey was conducted between December 15 and January 5 and covered
15,000 outlets in retailing, wholesaling and motor trades.

FT  18 JAN 94 / Regions report good trading performances
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT and CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Companies in northern England and the east Midlands have started to put the
recession behind them, according to two surveys yesterday.
Business Survey North, the quarterly report on the north-east and Cumbria,
indicated that the fourth quarter of 1993 had the highest-ever positive
balances for home sales, home orders and profits since the survey began in
mid-1990, before the recession hit the area.
And in a survey of business performance at 353 companies in the east
Midlands, the Association of East Midlands Chambers of Commerce said 36 per
cent of companies reported a rise in export orders in December, compared
with 27 per cent in September and 38 per cent in June.
Business Survey North reported that, following two successive quarterly
falls, export sales and orders were up, plant and machinery investment
reached a new peak, and training expenditure increased sharply in response
to skill shortages.
However, the survey said that improved performance had yet to lead to a
sustained growth in employment, which fell back to the 1993 second-quarter
level and showed little prospect of improvement in the first quarter of
1994.
Business confidence also suffered a setback, possibly, in response to the
extra tax increases announced in the November Budget. But businesses had
growing optimism about the long term.
The increase in home sales, the survey said, bore out anecdotal evidence
that the economy enjoyed a pre-Christmas boost; 51.6 per cent of companies
reported an improvement, and 20.6 per cent a decline. Manufacturers
accounted for most of the improvement.
Predictions of turnover growth reached a record positive balance; 66.7 per
cent of respondents forecast an increase, against 8.8 per cent forecasting
decline.
Meanwhile, in the east Midlands the level of domestic business appears to
have flattened out after a surge of orders last spring.
The east Midlands chambers of commerce said that in December 40 per cent of
companies had order books fatter than three months before. That compares
with 42 per cent in September and June and 28 per cent last March.
However, the region also had plenty of unused capacity: 32 per cent of
companies were operating at full capacity, 4 percentage points more than
September but 8 percentage points less than June.
Last month 59 per cent of companies were expecting a rise in turnover, but
only 45 per cent expected a rise in profitability.

FT  18 JAN 94 / Laws planned for media changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government made clear yesterday that it is determined to create a
legislative framework to cope with the 'multi-media future' - the merging of
industries such as computing, entertainment and telecommunications.
Mr Peter Brooke, the national heritage secretary, speaking two weeks after
announcing a review of cross-media ownership, said the government would be
negligent if it did not create a framework for such changes. A vast new
marketplace was developing and the government was determined to ensure there
were British stallholders, he said. Broadcasting was a national resource of
the greatest importance.
He added: 'I would be negligent in my duty if I looked at purely commercial
arguments at the expense of cultural. Equally, a short-sighted clinging to
the status quo and a failure to recognise the changing needs of the industry
would be self-defeating.'
Newsprint and videotape were powerful weapons and could do great harm 'in
the wrong hands or concentrated too heavily in too few hands'.
Mr Brooke said the UK could look forward to the multi-media future with
confidence because of the strength of its programme-making, its advanced
digital and satellite technology and the 'vibrancy' of its national
newspaper market. The review of cross-media ownership is expected to take at
least six months.

FT  18 JAN 94 / Cash may bring new rail link bids
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Some large contractors that previously had expressed little interest in
bidding for contracts to build the Channel tunnel rail link said yesterday
they would reassess their position after reports that the government was
prepared to provide up to Pounds 1.5bn to encourage private-sector
investment in the Pounds 3bn project.
The reports said the Treasury had changed its view and was now prepared to
countenance a substantial contribution to the project. Previously it had
been thought that only Pounds 300m-Pounds 500m of public-sector money would
be available to build the line.
Construction companies said ministers' disappointment at the low response by
private-sector investors had prompted the rethink on the size of the
public-sector contribution.
Mr Keith Clarke, chief executive of Eurorail, a consortium of Trafalgar
House, BICC and GEC, one of the few groups to have expressed a formal
interest in developing the line, said: 'We have always taken the view that a
substantial non-user grant would be needed to make private investment viable
in such a large and complex project.'
Tarmac, the large UK construction company, has yet to express a formal
interest. It said yesterday that it would be reassessing its position.
Amec, another large construction group in a similar position, said a number
of issues would need to be resolved before it would consider a bid.
John Laing, which is building a privately financed road toll bridge across
the River Severn, said it 'was monitoring the situation'.
At least two other private-sector groups are understood to be considering a
bid. One is thought to be led by Hochtief, a German construction company
with UK interests.
Ove Arup, the UK consulting engineer, is also thought to be considering
forming a consortium to invest in the development.
Eurotunnel, the Channel tunnel operator, confirmed yesterday that it had
received a final bill for Pounds 2.6bn from contractors building the tunnel.
The formal claim from contractors had been submitted as a result of a
request from Eurotunnel and there was no reason why this should prompt legal
action. The Pounds 2.6bn represented Pounds 1.8bn at 1985 prices and 60 per
cent had been paid already, Eurotunnel said.

the courts.
More than 22,000 Names - the individuals whose assets have traditionally
supported the market - have until the middle of next month to accept or
reject the deal announced last month by Lloyd's. But it now seems highly
unlikely that Lloyd's will achieve its target of persuading 70 per cent of
Names - by value of the offer - to accept.
The 3,000 members of the Gooda Walker Action Group - Gooda Names taking
legal action - stood to receive Pounds 220m, 24.4 per cent of the total
compensation on offer, had they accepted.
'We will continue litigation in a determined fashion,' said Mr Michael
Deeny, the action group's chairman. He predicted that legal action would
produce significantly more than the proposed settlement, which is worth only
about 38p in the pound for Gooda Names, and which contained 'deeply
unsatisfactory conditions'.
These included the absence of any provision for 'deterioration' - further
claims against the syndicates which for action-group members could add
Pounds 185m to existing losses of Pounds 580m - and the fact that the
settlement would be paid in the form of credits rather than in cash. A total
of 1,563 group members voted against the offer, with 300 voting for and five
abstentions. As a result all members of the action group are expected to
reject the offer.
More than 4,000 Names were members of seven Gooda Walker syndicates, whose
total losses could eventually reach more than Pounds 1.1bn.
Last week a second large group of lossmaking Names, those on Merrett
syndicate 418 in 1985, indicated they would reject the offer, while a third
large group, the Feltrim Names, is expected to vote down the offer when they
meet on Friday.
At least three of the Gooda Walker and two Feltrim syndicates specialised in
so-called 'spiral' reinsurance, in which Lloyd's syndicates and insurance
companies reinsured each others' high-level catastrophe exposures.
The Gooda Names' legal case alleging negligence by Lloyd's agents is set to
come to court on April 26. Mr Philip Rocher, of Wilde Sapte, the solicitors
handling the group's action, said he expected a decision from the court by
next autumn and an appeal to be heard before the end of 1995. Sir Derek
Spencer, the solicitor-general, assured the Commons yesterday that
allegations of dishonesty in the Lloyd's insurance market would be
rigorously pursued by the regulatory authority and the prosecuting
authorities, Ivor Owen writes. The Serious Fraud Office was pursuing two
cases, and the Crown Prosecution Service one case, he said.

FT  18 JAN 94 / Retired women win gas cash deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sixteen women who were compulsorily retired by British Gas at 60 have won an
Pounds 812,794 out-of-court settlement after pursuing a claim for
discrimination, Lisa Wood writes.
The women, who were retired in 1986, went through the UK courts to the
European Court of Justice and to the House of Lords. In 1992 the Lords ruled
that the women had been discriminated against because they were retired at
60 when men doing the same work were allowed to stay until 65.
The case was remitted by the Lords to the London South Industrial Tribunal
with the case for compensation scheduled to start yesterday. There is no
ceiling on the amount a tribunal can impose.
Unison, the public service union which backed the women's case, said: 'The
company made the offer of Pounds 812,794 which averaged Pounds 50,799 for
each applicant.'
British Gas said that the figures included lost earnings as well as lost
pension. It was pleased the issue had been settled out of court in spite of
the fact that under UK law the retirement age was 60 for women and 65 for
men.

FT  18 JAN 94 / Tougher scrutiny for retail developers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Gummer, envi-ronment secretary, yesterday signalled tougher scrutiny
of planning applications for out-of-town retail developments, with the aim
of 'putting the heart back' into cities.
He told the Town and Country Planning Association's annual seminar on
planning and development control that he had 'decided to take a rather
closer interest in retail proposals outside the main shopping areas of our
main towns and cities'.
Mr Gummer said he had asked the department and its regional offices to
notify him of all developments that would affect the quality of towns and
cities. He added that he would be looking at the response of local
authorities and retailers to the government's planning policy guidance
issued in July. If the guidelines were not being followed he would consider
strengthening them.
The guidelines are aimed at encouraging retail investment in town centres to
slow the drift of retailing from town centres to edge-of-own or out-of-town
shopping centres and superstores. But there has been confusion over how they
should be interpreted.
Mr Tony Baldry, environment minister, sought to end the confusion in
November, when he said the government expected retailers and developers 'to
look first at town centres'.
Mr Gummer has made it clear several times that he feels very strongly about
the need to protect town centres from being damaged by out-of-town retail
developments.
The environment department said yesterday that it was too early to tell
whether the guidelines were having an effect, but added that Mr Gummer
wanted to emphasise that he would strengthen them if necessary.
That would have important implications for out-of-town retail developers,
and for superstore operators who are still spending billions of pounds in
total each year on expansion, mainly into edge-of-town and out-of-town
locations.

FT  18 JAN 94 / Cheaper Times and Sun hold circulation gains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Sun and The Times, the two News International national newspapers which
last year cut their cover prices, continue to hold on to significant
circulation gains.
The Audit Bureau of Circulation said sales of the 20p Sun averaged 3,737,188
in December, up 8.19 per cent compared with the same month last year.
Average sales for the second half of last year were 3,761,733, an increase
of just over 6 per cent.
In December sales of the 30p weekday Times averaged 439,327, a 17 per cent
rise on December 1992. The six-month average - with only four months at 30p
 -was 412,853, a rise of 8.88 per cent.
The increases The Times has achieved could be enough to pay for its price
cut if advertising yields have increased. The paper gets 65 per cent of its
revenue from advertising.
The Sun, which raises about 70 per cent of its revenue from sales, is
unlikely to be close to covering the cost of the cut.
News International is still hoping that ways can be found to push sales of
The Sun back up to 4m.
Meanwhile the Audit Bureau of Circulation figures confirmed the continued
slide of both The Independent and the Independent on Sunday as talks
continued about their future ownership.
The Independent averaged 301,987 in December, down 13.9 per cent on December
1992. The comparable figure for the Independent on Sunday is 335,475, a drop
of 14.76 per cent.

FT  18 JAN 94 / OFT to probe sales of electrical warranties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Neil Hamilton, corporate affairs minister, has asked the Office of Fair
Trading to investigate the sale of extended warranties on electrical goods,
following allegations that consumers were being 'ripped off' by retailers.
In a written question last week, Mr Nigel Griffiths, Labour's consumer
spokesman, claimed electrical stores were selling extended warranties for up
to three times more than manufacturers charged for their own schemes.
Retailers were failing to tell customers that cheaper extended warranties -
which provide additional protection after the expiry of standard product
guarantees - were often available directly from manufacturers.
The OFT confirmed yesterday that the matter had been referred to it by Mr
Hamilton, and it was conducting inquiries with a view to launching an
investigation.
Such an investigation would have important implications for electrical
retailers, and particularly Dixons, the UK's largest, where extended
warranty business is thought to account for up to 10 per cent of sales and
gross profits.
Mr Griffiths said electrical stores were using the sale of warranties to
inflate profits during the recession.
'What is at issue is the failure to spell out to purchasers any alternative
to the stores' own warranty schemes,' he said. 'Stores must not be allowed
to profiteer at the expense of consumers.'
Among examples cited by Mr Griffiths were a branch of Currys, part of the
Dixons group, selling a five-year warranty for a Sony hi-fi system for
Pounds 155, when Sony could provide its own warranty for Pounds 60, and a
branch of Comet, part of the Kingfisher group, charging Pounds 119 for a
five-year warranty for a Sony system, compared with the manufacturer's
Pounds 60.
Mr John Clare, Dixons' chief executive, said retailers' warranties were more
expensive 'because they are different'. Manufacturers' warranties often
covered only the failure of parts - sometimes with important exclusions -
while those offered by retailers included all parts and labour, as well as
accidental damage.
He said: 'Retailers can give better service than manufacturers. We would
often exchange a product with a new one if it was not repairable, or even
replace it with another manufacturer's product.'
Mr Clare added that manufacturers' schemes were sometimes priced
unrealistically.
Kingfisher criticised the proportion of Dixons' profits from extended
warranties during its failed takeover bid in 1990. Dixons no longer
publishes separate results for its financial services division, which
includes extended warranties, but the business is thought to make a gross
profit of about Pounds 30m a year.
One retailing analyst said: 'Extended warranties are part of the cut and
thrust of negotiating over pricing.'

FT  18 JAN 94 / River fish caught up in a Pounds 67m controversy: The
opening of a public inquiry into a south Wales barrage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The twaite shad is an obscure fish but, together with other migratory
species, it will feature prominently at a public inquiry which opens today
into a proposal to build a Pounds 67m barrage across the river Usk in
Newport, south Wales.
The scheme has drawn more than 250 objections from individuals and bodies
such as the National Rivers Authority, Brecon Beacons national park and the
United Usk Fishermen's Association.
They are concerned at the possible effect of the barrage on one of Wales's
most renowned rivers. It includes species such as salmon, sewin, eels and
the shad, described by the NRA as of 'special conservation interest'.
It is the third barrage proposed in south Wales, all with the intention of
encouraging the regeneration of surrounding derelict areas by improving
their appearance.
One across the Tawe at Swansea was completed a year ago. After protracted
parliamentary opposition, work is starting on the Cardiff Bay barrage which
will create a 500-acre freshwater lake.
Newport's barrage is promoted by the borough council and Gwent county
council, and would be funded by the two councils. The barrage, with the
secondary aims of providing a road crossing and flood protection, has the
support of the town's two MPs.
Two enabling bills have been withdrawn, the second time because of a 1992
act which allows the parliamentary process to be sidestepped by a public
inquiry.
The final decision will rest with Mr John Redwood, the Welsh secretary. If
approval is given, construction will start in 1997, with completion in the
year 2000.
There is optimistic talk of the barrage leading to Pounds 300m of investment
and the creation of 5,000 jobs.
Newport has already been successful in attracting companies to business
parks near the M4 and has hopes of winning more when the second Severn
crossing is completed in 1996. But the old docklands area near the town
centre remains largely derelict, with decrepit sheds, scrapyards and
boarded-up shops. At low tide the banks of the Usk are a dismal spectacle of
mud, debris and sewage outlets.
'The town has turned its back on the river,' said Mr Roger Davies, head of
urban development for Newport. He argues that the dereliction reinforces the
image of a 19th-century industrial town.
In contrast, Mr David Jones Powell, a solicitor representing the United Usk
Fishermen's Association, regards the barrage as 'a 20th-century folly'. He
says the fishermen are not opposed to the regeneration of Newport, but a
barrage appears to be a frivolous solution. 'Newport's case seems to be that
mudbanks have put off development but that hasn't happened elsewhere.'
The anglers' concern that migratory species would be deterred, in spite of
the barrage's fish passes, is shared by Powys county council, the
Countryside Council for Wales and Brecon Beacons national park. Authorities
at the park, which covers about 35 miles of the upper Usk, are also worried
about the effect on otters.
In its evidence to the inquiry the NRA will say that migratory fish would
have to negotiate the barrage and then 11 miles of impounded water. The
barrage 'would create an unacceptable risk to the fish stocks and fisheries
of the river, particularly in view of their high conservation, sporting and
commercial value'.
Some anglers believe there is initial evidence that the run of salmon on the
Tawe has been lower since Swansea's barrage opened, although the city
council says it is too early for firm conclusions and it is unaware of any
real problems. The NRA is to publish an interim study of the Tawe's fish
stocks. This could influence the Newport inquiry, which is expected to last
three months.

FT  18 JAN 94 / Truro bus staff to hold third strike vote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The RMT transport union is holding a third postal strike ballot of its 500
members who work for the Western National bus company after facing a court
injunction threatening sequestration of funds and fining of union officials.
Mr Jimmy Knapp, the union's general secretary, has called off a planned
one-day strike tomorrow at the Truro-based company after consulting union
members there.
A High Court judge granted the company an injunction last week after a
second ballot produced only a 188-185 vote in favour of a strike. Western
National said 12 employees had either not received ballot papers or had
received them but not had enough time to return them.
The union said there had been a problem caused by changes of address and the
slowness of postal deliveries over Christmas. The ballot was conducted by
the independent Electoral Ballot Services.
The union had called the second ballot after the first ballot produced a
176-164 vote for a strike. A number of members had failed to receive voting
papers in the first ballot, the union said.
Aslef, the train drivers' union, yesterday decided to call a strike ballot
of its 2,000 members at London Transport after the breakdown of talks on the
introduction of a five-day working week.

FT  18 JAN 94 / Sinn Fein waits for clarification
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sinn Fein will make no formal response to the Downing Street declaration
until it has received the clarification it has demanded from London and
Dublin.
Mr Tom Hartley, Sinn Fein's national chairman, gave the first explicit
confirmation of this stance yesterday, as the party used a Westminster press
conference to publish its version of the contacts between the British
government and republican leaders.
Mr Hartley said: 'Sinn Fein has actually sent a letter to John Major asking
for clarification. I think it is obvious Sinn Fein will not make its
decision until it gets that clarification.'
His remarks leave the UK-Irish peace initiative at an apparent impasse:
London has said repeatedly that no clarification of the joint declaration is
necessary.
Unveiling a dense 47-page document giving details of the dialogue between
Sinn Fein and the British government, Mr Hartley also revealed the
principles enshrined in the so-called Hume-Adams accord.
Mr Hartley referred to three principles agreed by Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn
Fein president, and Mr John Hume, leader of the mainly Catholic Social
Democratic and Labour party, during secret discussions last year. These
were:
That there should be no 'internal' solution (ie within the 'six counties')
to the Irish problem.
That there should be a right of national self-determination for the people
of Ireland as a whole.
That it was 'desirable' for unionists to be on board.
Speaking of 'a period of political flux,' Mr Hartley said he doubted the
Irish situation would ever revert to that before Hume-Adams. 'I think there
is a momentum about Ireland now,' he said. 'In a sense, the logjam has been
broken.'
In its version of the contacts with the British government - which it said
stretched back over 20 years - Sinn Fein again insisted that last year's
series of messages was initiated by London.
An introduction to the dossier - which claims there are further textual
errors and bogus messages in London's version of the exchanges - states: 'In
the early part of 1993, the British government proposed a series of meetings
with Sinn Fein, arguing that an intensive round of such meetings would
result in Irish republicans being convinced that armed struggle was no
longer necessary.
'They requested a two-to-three week undeclared suspension of operations by
the Irish Republican Army to facilitate this. Sinn Fein sought and gained
such a commitment from the IRA.'
Downing Street last night attacked Sinn Fein for trying to divert attention
from its failure to embrace the UK-Irish peace process.

Scotland were brushed aside by Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, in the
Commons last night.
Labour and Liberal Democrat MPs insisted that proposals to replace the
existing 53 district councils, nine regional councils and three island
councils with 28 single-tier authorities were designed to improve the
electoral prospects of the Conservative party.
Mr George Robertson, shadow Scottish secretary, denounced the Local
Government (Scotland) bill as 'shabby, politically corrupt and
anti-democratic'. He said that it would 'increase the dead weight of
bureaucracy'.
The 'politically corrupt, wasteful legislation' would be rejected by voters
in the local elections this May, he said.
Mr Jim Wallace, Liberal Democrat spokesman in the debate, said his party was
in favour of single-tier authorities but was not prepared to support a bill
'motivated by purely party political reasons'.
Mr Lang said MPs and peers would have opportunities to suggest changes to
the local authority boundaries proposed by the government during the later
stages of the bill's passage through parliament.
He accused the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities of burying its head
in the sand by adopting an obstructive attitude to the government's
proposals.

FT  18 JAN 94 / DTI shake-up scraps post of chief scientist
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH and CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Department of Trade and Industry is to abolish the post of chief
scientist as part of a reorganisation of top jobs aimed at improving the
department's work to assist industrial competitiveness.
The announcement was greeted with 'disappointment' by Ms Fiona Steele, head
of technology policy at the Confederation of British Industry, who said the
abolition of the science adviser's job 'diminishes the role of science and
technology right across the government'.
Dr John Mulvey, secretary of the Save British Science campaign, said it
would be 'a serious step backwards' while Dr Lewis Moonie, Labour science
spokesman, called the change 'sadly predictable'.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said the changes marked
'another step in restructuring the department to ensure that it is best
placed to fulfil my principal objective of helping UK business to win in
world markets'.
Under the reorganisation, taking place on March 1, scientific issues will be
dealt with by officials examining broad industrial problems in a revamped
'industrial sponsorship' division. Science and technology currently have
their own separate unit.
The department will not seek a replacement for Mr Geoffrey Robinson, chief
science and technology adviser, who leaves next month after less than two
years.
The department denied that the move devalued the role of science and
technology. 'We are incorporating this area most closely within the rest of
the organisation,' it said.
In recent years the DTI has reduced funding for research and development,
arguing that this is a job for the private sector, and has focused on
promoting good management practice and transfer of existing technologies to
companies.
Mr Alastair Macdonald, a deputy secretary currently in charge of one of the
DTI's industry divisions, will supervise all the department's work in
'sponsoring' specific business sectors.
The department's work on technology transfer and the spreading of management
best-practice will be linked with efforts to assist small and medium-size
enterprises.

FT  18 JAN 94 / Hurd backs Portillo and denies intention to quit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, yesterday firmly backed the sharp
attack launched last week by his cabinet colleague Mr Michael Portillo on
critics of Britain's national institutions.
As ministers continued their struggle to rescue Mr John Major's 'back to
basics' initiative, Mr Hurd also dismissed weekend reports that he had
remained in the government only after a plea from the prime minister.
In a confident performance that reinforced hopes among Conservative MPs that
the recent political storms were beginning to fade, Mr Hurd said: 'If I was
prepared to leave I would have left.'
Speaking on BBC Radio 2's Jimmy Young programme, he added: 'I enjoy what I
do. I seem to have a good deal to do and I have no present intention of
leaving and no one seems to be asking me to do so. In short, I stay.'
Mr Hurd rejected suggestions that the speech by Mr Portillo, chief secretary
to the Treasury, which attacked critics of the Church, monarchy and
parliament, represented another attempt by the Tory right to hijack Mr
Major's call for a return to traditional values.
The foreign secretary said that Mr Portillo, the cabinet's Thatcherite
standard-bearer, had in fact delivered a 'high Tory' speech. The chief
secretary had been saying that 'the business of the Conservative party, of
the Tory party, is to protect and defend the institutions of this country'.
Mr Hurd added: 'There was nothing in it with which I disagreed.'
In another effort to dispel the ambiguity surrounding 'back to basics', Mr
Hurd said there was no doubt that the initiative had a moral element. He
also accepted that there were occasions when acts of personal immorality by
politicians must disqualify them from office.
However, he said each case had to be examined individually: 'I do not think
people want the government to have an inspector in every politician's
bedroom.'

FT  18 JAN 94 / Fresh Tory blood kept off the menu: The prime minister's
performance at the arms-for-Iraq inquiry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
By normal standards Mr John Major's appearance before the Scott inquiry into
arms exports to Iraq was uneventful. By the standards of the last week,
however, it was a triumph.
So low is the government's stock in the wake of the 'back to basics' row
that a poor performance by Mr Major could have been fatal for his
leadership. In the event, he delivered a confident testimony that gave no
ground to critics' claims that he must have known about unpublished changes
to the government's guidelines for arms-related exports to Iraq.
It was not an electrifying spectacle. Baroness Thatcher struck the inquiry
like a lightning bolt. Lord Howe set off a storm that is still rumbling. Mr
Major merely looked in keeping with the grey Monday morning outside.
But spectacle is not everything. If Mr Major rarely looked prime
ministerial, he did occasionally manage to look magisterial.
By the end, even Mr Robin Cook, the shadow trade and industry secretary,
seemed to have accepted that fresh Tory blood was off the menu.
Ms Presiley Baxendale QC, the constitutionally nervous counsel to the
inquiry, did her best to unsettle the prime minister, returning again and
again to questions about what he knew and when he knew it.
But it became clear as the long day wore on that neither Ms Baxendale nor
Lord Justice Scott had any real evidence to counteract Mr Major's assertion
that he knew nothing about alleged changes to the guidelines until November
1992.
Ms Baxendale tried hard. The judge weighed in too, occasionally conducting a
long cross-examination of the prime minister.
But the day belonged to Mr Major. After a weekend studying the documents he
looked well-briefed and aware of the strong points of his case.
He made the most of them. After the Matrix-Churchill trial, he had ordered a
'massive trawl' of government files he had never seen so that he could
respond with accuracy to parliamentary questions; he did not see documents
that spelt out the debate over changes to the guidelines; intelligence
briefings were not passed to him; he was not informed about public interest
immunity certificates signed by other ministers to prevent the release of
government documents during the Matrix-Churchill trial.
It was a defence that defeated the best efforts of the inquiry team. But it
left opposition critics fuming that Mr Major was allowed to get away with
claiming he knew nothing about the arms affair, in spite of holding four
cabinet posts during the period.
Mr Cook said: 'The departments through which he passed appear to have been
stuffed with documents which he never saw, or which he saw but did not read
to the end, or which he read but did not take in.'
In the end, however, Mr Major probably summed up his own evidence most
concisely - while describing his efforts to discover the truth about the
alleged changes to the guidelines.
'Something I was not aware had happened suddenly turned out not to have
happened,' he said. It was a summing up of which even Lord Justice Scott
would have been proud.

FT  18 JAN 94 / Insider dealers fined Pounds 1,500
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two chartered accountants were each fined Pounds 1,500 at Inner London crown
court yesterday after being convicted of insider dealing by using
confidential knowledge of a planned hostile takeover bid.
Mr Ian Morrisey, who works for Hope, Agar and Staines, and Ms Lorelie
Staines, formerly with accountants Kidsons Impey, both persuaded others to
deal in the shares of building products supplier Aaronson Brothers after
learning of a planned takeover bid to be launched by Glunz AG, a German wood
company, the court heard.
Ms Staines's father bought 12,000 shares which were later sold for Pounds
3,000 profit. Mr Morrisey passed the information on to a contact who bought
5,000 shares. Mr Morrisey bought the shares back before the takeover was
announced and later sold them for a Pounds 1,500 profit.
Aaronson shares rose from 50p to 80p after the bid announcement in August
1990.
The pair gained the information about the bid from a friend, Mr Martin
Priddle, an accountant with KPMG Peat Marwick who was later sacked. He 'let
the cat out of the bag' two weeks before the announcement of the bid when he
met Mr Morrisey and Ms Staines at a garden party, prosecuting counsel said.
The prosecution was brought by the Department of Trade and Industry after an
investigation in November 1990.

FT  18 JAN 94 / Heseltine to review local authorities' powers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, yesterday announced
a 'far-reaching' review of local authorities' enforcement functions, after
complaints by business that many responsibilities were duplicated.
The move was welcomed by the Confederation of British Industry. But it could
clash with the review of local government structure in England being
conducted by Sir John Banham for the Department of the Environment.
Sir John's Local Government Commission has been asked by Mr John Gummer, the
environment secretary, to find ways to create all-purpose unitary
authorities to replace the two-tier system of district and county councils.
Mr Gummer has also recommended that the new authorities should not be very
large or remote. However, the DTI's review now appears to be re-examining
this advice.
Mr Heseltine's review will examine ways to minimise the costs to business
and the enforcers in such areas as building and planning control, trading
standards, environmental health, food safety and health and safety.
The DTI said: 'Concern has been expressed by business, including through the
Deregulation Task Forces, about the burdens placed upon them by the number
of different inspectors and enforcers who visit them in unco-ordinated ways
on similar subjects.'
The CBI said: 'We welcome this announcement delightedly. It echoes many of
the concerns we have expressed about duplication. We are concerned that
there should be consistency and not fragmentation of regulatory authorities.
'A lot will depend on what emerges from the Local Government Commission, but
fragmentation has been recommended in Wales.'
The Labour-led Association of County Councils said: 'This is going to
complicate matters for the local government review. We argued before the
Banham review started that the issue of enforcement functions should have
been sorted out first.'
In the Welsh local government reorganisation, trading standards officers are
trying to ensure that trading standards are covered by three large
authorities, although Wales will be split into 21 councils. Each council
would nominate members for the authority covering its area.
The DTI body will include officials from interested departments and
representatives of local authority associations. It must report within 90
days.

FT  18 JAN 94 / New laws promised for media future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government made clear yesterday that it is determined to create a
legislative framework to cope with the 'multi-media future' - the merging of
industries such as computing, entertainment and telecommunications.
Mr Peter Brooke, the national heritage secretary, speaking two weeks after
announcing a review of cross-media ownership, said the government would be
negligent if it did not create a framework for such changes.
A vast new marketplace was developing and the government was determined to
ensure there were British stallholders. Mr Brooke said broadcasting was a
national resource of the greatest importance.
'I would be negligent in my duty if I looked at purely commercial arguments
at the expense of cultural. Equally, a short-sighted clinging to the status
quo and a failure to recognise the changing needs of the industry would be
self-defeating,' he said.
Newsprint and videotape were powerful weapons and could do great harm 'in
the wrong hands or concentrated too heavily in too few hands'.
Mr Brooke said the UK could look forward to the multi-media future with
confidence because of the strength of its programme-making, its advanced
digital and satellite technology and the 'vibrancy' of its national
newspaper market. The review of cross-media ownership is expected to take at
least six months.

<TEXT>
The government plans to review fire safety legislation as part of its
de-regulation programme, Richard Donkin writes.
The Department of Trade and Industry said the review would consist of
examining how enforcement could be improved through better co-ordination
without sacrificing safety standards.
The review team has been asked to identify areas of overlap between bodies -
including local authorities - that are responsible for enforcing
legislation. It has also been asked to look at the practicality of bringing
all policy responsibilities for fire safety together in a single department.

FT  18 JAN 94 / World Trade News: Mercosur states delay decision on common
tariffs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER and JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAO PAULO, BUENOS AIRES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The presidents of the four member countries of Mercosur, Latin America's
largest planned common market, yesterday agreed to postpone a decision on
the full implementation of common external tariffs, the most controversial
dispute dividing them.
The presidents of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay - respectively
Carlos Menem, Itamar Franco, Juan Carlos Wasmosy and Luis Alberto Lacalle -
in Uruguay for their regular biannual summit, said they would try to agree
on tariffs by the end of June, six months later than planned.
This will make it virtually impossible for Mercosur to meet its January 1
deadline to establish a fully-fledged common market, in which goods would
circulate freely while imports from outside the region would be subject to
common external tariffs.
The four have agreed tariffs for trade between themselves and with other
countries for about 85 per cent of goods. These are being steadily lowered
to come into force at the beginning of next year.
However, their failure to agree on external tariffs for sensitive areas like
high-technology goods and chemicals means that integration can be only
partial at this stage. Brazil has demanded high import tariffs to protect
its advanced technology industries, while its smaller, less-industrialised
partners want low tariffs.
Original hopes of bringing down tariffs on these sensitive products to the
lower levels enjoyed by most products by 2001 are also likely to be delayed.
Officials have mentioned a possible five-year delay until 2006 for these
sensitive goods, which also include telecommunications equipment and
computers.
Despite the disagreements on tariffs, which were expected, the four
countries did make headway in important harmonisation measures. The
presidents agreed to recognise the Basle Accord that specifies capital
requirements for banks, harmonise regulations for the securities industry
and simplify as well as co-ordinate customs procedures at border crossings.
The four countries were also due to sign joint investment protection
agreements.
President Itamar Franco used the meeting to call again for Mercosur to
become the base for a free-trade area for the whole of the continent.
Regional rivalries, and uncertainty about Brazil's economic instability,
have led to only lukewarm responses to Brazil's overtures in the past.

FT  18 JAN 94 / World Trade News: Pact freezes Chinese textile exports to US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BEIJING, HONG KONG, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US and China struck a last-minute textile quota agreement yesterday that
effectively freezes Chinese imports to the US at present levels and averts a
serious trade dispute.
Under the agreement, signed in Beijing by special trade representatives,
China's exports to the US market will not be allowed to grow as they have in
the past three years. The move will cost Chinese exporters about Dollars
700m (Pounds 472.9m) and result in a 13 per cent reduction in expected
shipments to the US in 1994-1996.
China also agreed to penalties, proposed by the US, for violations of quota
restrictions.
A senior US trade official, briefing reporters, said the Chinese had agreed
reluctantly to the quota penalties, but had clearly recognised that the row
over illicit trans-shipments, overshipments and false labelling was harming
China's image and trade prospects.
Trans-shipment involves Chinese-manufactured goods being transported through
third countries - such as Malaysia, Hong Kong and the United Arab Emirates -
to disguise their origin.
US officials believe that the value of illegal trans-shipments of textile
items exceeds Dollars 2bn annually.
Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, yesterday welcomed the textile
pact as 'the beginning of a healthier and more productive relationship'
between the US and China.
Mr Henry Tang, textiles chief at the Hong Kong Federation of Industry, said
the three-year agreement was good news for the colony.
'Our position as the major trans-shipment port (for Chinese textiles) is
assured,' Mr Tang said.
The deal was seen as boding well for an agreement to extend China's most
favoured nation (MFN) status by the US administration this year. For Hong
Kong, the extension of MFN is far more important than the current dispute
about trans-shipment irregularities.
Sir Hamish Macleod, Hong Kong financial secretary, said yesterday that
renewal of China's MFN could not be taken for granted. He said that, if
China were to lose its MFN status in the US market, growth in Hong Kong
might be halved from its forecast level of 5 per cent this year.
China's textile exports to the US under the Multi-Fibre Arrangement amounted
to Dollars 4.68bn in 1993. Shipments of silk clothes - the fastest-growing
Chinese garment exports to the US - accounted for a further Dollars 2.5bn.
China's trade surplus with the US reached Dollars 25bn last year, prompting
demands by US Congress members for steps to restrain Chinese imports.
After the signing ceremony, Ms Jennifer Hillman, the chief US negotiator,
said the agreement would 'provide for consistent and orderly growth of
China's textile and textile product exports to the US'.
China dominates textile exports to the US, accounting for 20-25 per cent of
all clothing sold. US textile industry representatives say that illegal
Chinese imports have cost 50,000 US jobs. US customs seized some Dollars
581m of textiles illegally imported into the US since 1991, during the
previous agreement.
Mrs Wu Yi, China's trade minister, expressed satisfaction with the
agreement, appearing relieved that US demands had not been more severe.

ABB Asea Brown Boveri, the leading power engineering group, has won an order
worth more than Dollars 100m (Pounds 67.5m) for a combined heat and power
plant at Gera near Leipzig, reports Ian Rodger in Zurich.
The order, from Kraftwerke Gera, is the seventh ABB has received for
building or refurbishing power plants in eastern Germany since its
integration into the federal republic.
The power station will deliver 76MW of electric power and 250MW of thermal
energy for the local district heating system. ABB will supply two gas
turbines, two steam turbines and the entire electrical plant. The plant is
to be in operation by mid-1996.

FT  18 JAN 94 / World Trade News: Mercedes bus plant in Mexico
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mercedes-Benz is to produce up to 3,000 buses and long-distance coaches a
year at a DM80m (Pounds 31m) plant opened last week at Monterrey in northern
Mexico.
The plant will be operated by Mercedes-Benz Omnibuses Mexico, 85 per cent
owned by the German vehicle-maker's Mexican subsidiary and 15 per cent by
CAIO, a Brazilian coach body-builder. Output will be sold exclusively in the
domestic Mexican market, where Mercedes-Benz already has about a third of
the heavy bus market (above eight tonnes).
Mercedes-Benz will supply chassis for the Monterrey facility from its main
Mexican plant in Santiago Tianguistenco near Mexico City, while the bodies
will be supplied from Brazil by CAIO.
The local content of the buses produced at the factory will be around 60 per
cent. The workforce will rise from around 100 at present to 850 by the end
of the year. Mercedes-Benz has invested Dollars 100m (Pounds 67.5m) in
Mexico in the past five years and is planning to spend another Dollars 100m.

will import 1,500-3,000 Protons, which will be used as taxis.
The Proton sale forms part of a complex trade and investment deal being
negotiated by Malaysia and Indonesia.
Under agreements signed during a visit to Indonesia last week by Mr Anwar
Ibrahim, Malaysia's deputy prime minister and finance minister, Malaysia
will contribute Dollars 50m (Pounds 33m) to a joint venture capital company
which will seek to develop small and medium-scale industries in Indonesia.
There are also talks on a possible sale to Malaysia of Indonesian transport

FT  18 JAN 94 / World Trade News: Brittan warns on protectionism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Leon Brittan, chief EU trade negotiator, yesterday said that moves to
put environmental protection and labour standards at the top of the agenda
for future world trade talks could be a pretext for protectionism.
Cautioning against 'fashionable and politically correct' solutions to trade
problems, Sir Leon distanced himself from recent suggestions made by US
President Bill Clinton during his maiden trip to Europe as head of state.
In an address to the Centre for European Policy Studies one month after the
successful conclusion of the Gatt Uruguay Round, the senior British
commissioner also warned the US against the use of unilateralism in trade
disputes, and against strengthening retaliatory powers under section 301 of
the US Trade Act.
'The US will have to understand that it has committed itself to the
multilateral process that I have described, however tempting domestic policy
considerations may be to resort to unilateral action.'
His words may irritate the Clinton administration, which has pledged to be
'even tougher' in tackling unfair trading practices in the post-Uruguay
Round era. It may also raise hackles in the US Congress, which is due to
consider ratification of the Gatt accord this year.
In his speech, Sir Leon described the agreement last month as just as
significant as the creation of the Gatt itself in 1947. It provided a new
framework for open trade in services, a clear timetable for resolution of
trade disputes, significantly lower tariffs in industrial products, and a
binding agreement to reduce subsidies and protection in farm products. 'It
is more difficult for the law of the jungle to prevail,' he said.
Before leaving for talks in Brussels with Mr Peter Sutherland,
director-general of Gatt, Sir Leon added that it was important to produce
better offers on market access before the February 15 deadline.
He singled out Japan as needing to improve offers on white spirits and
liqueurs, though Tokyo has countered that the EU and US deal on agriculture
and offers on electronics is also unsatisfactory.
On labour standards, Sir Leon expressed concern that it could lead the EU
into unprofitable arguments over human rights and could be hard to
administer. He also noted that the agreements attached to the Nafta
free-trade agreement by the US, Canada and Mexico provided only for
signatories to apply their own rules rather than impose standards from the
outside.

FT  18 JAN 94 / World Trade News: Banana trade talks go to the wire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Negotiations over a Latin American assault on the European Union's
controversial banana import regime are expected to continue today, with
Latin American negotiators at odds with each other, and the European
Commission alarmed that a breakdown will result in publication of a report
damning its preferential trading arrangements with former colonies.
Four of five Latin American banana exporters who brought a complaint against
the EU banana import regime to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
last year agreed at a key meeting in Costa Rica last Thursday to bow to
intense Union pressure to accept Europe's proposed new banana import regime.
However, the fifth - Guatemala - remains resolutely opposed to a settlement.
It has won backing from Ecuador, Panama and Honduras, which are important
banana exporters, but feel they have been sold short in a proposed European
compromise because they are not members of Gatt.
Consensus among the four Latin American countries willing to accept the EU
compromise - Colombia, Costa Rica, Nicaragua and Venezuela - appeared
fragile late yesterday, as it was reported that Nicaragua was unhappy that
Costa Rica and Colombia were the main beneficiaries of compromise.
The Latin Americans were warned in a letter signed by three EU commissioners
last week that the Union's new quota offer would not be improved, and would
be withdrawn if it was not accepted before a Gatt panel report on the Latin
American complaint is published.
Gatt officials yesterday agreed to delay release of the report to this
evening, two days after the deadline for publication, in an effort to allow
negotiators to reach a compromise.

FT  18 JAN 94 / Government takes over Banco Latino: Big losses feared at
Venezuelan bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOSEPH MANN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CARACAS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Venezuelan government yesterday appointed Mr Roger Urbina, the
superintendent of banks, to take full control of the failed Banco Latino,
the country's second largest commercial bank.
The announcement followed a government decision late on Sunday night to
intervene in the troubled institution, an official admission of the bank's
failure. Banco Latino was suspended from the national cheque clearing system
by the central bank last Thursday.
The superintendent and a new government-appointed board will take full
control of the bank, carry out a 90-day study of its financial situation,
and later try to sell it, Mr Urbina said. This means the cash-strapped
government, which has provided financial support for the bank since last
month, will have to pour more money into the institution to pay off
depositors and try to meet other obligations.
Mr Urbina said the bank, which did not open for business on Friday, would
re-open next week and would give priority to claims by holders of small
savings accounts (the equivalent of Dollars 9,345 or less).
There are no public estimates by officials on how high the bank's losses in
Venezuela could go, but they are expected to be substantial and could have a
serious impact on other banks. Aside from affecting tens of thousands of
individual account-holders, the bank's failure has hurt a wide range of
businesses, including private corporations, part of the national oil company
and other government-owned concerns.
According to banking sources, Latino may also have considerable assets at
its offshore bank in Curacao.
The government delayed its decision to take over Latino while it took an
initial look at the books and discussed different options with the bank's
main stockholders and representatives of other big commercial banks. It
rejected options such as leaving the bank in the hands of its former owners
and establishing a pool of funds from other commercial banks to re-float the
institution. Government officials also said they were looking into possible
criminal violations by Banco Latino's board members.

   SAO PAULO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Brazil's Congress yesterday finished three months of hearings into an
alleged corruption network and looked set to recommend expelling 10-30
congressmen tainted by the scandal.
Mr Roberto Magalhaes, in charge of writing the investigation's final report,
is expected to release the document at the weekend. As well as recommending
expulsion or suspension of affected congressmen, the report is likely to
suggest several changes to the law and further investigation into
non-congressional figures who have been implicated. These include three
state governors and several ex-ministers.
The hearings, which at times brought proceedings in the capital Braslia to a
virtual standstill as more politicians were named, stemmed from allegations
of corruption affecting the framing of the government's budget.
It is alleged that, under the scheme, congressmen received 'fees', mainly
from construction companies, in return for approving government spending on
construction projects. Investigation of the bank accounts of implicated
politicians also led to the discovery of other influence-peddling schemes.
It is still unclear whether the most senior politicians to be implicated
will be expelled from Congress.
The investigation won wide public support but lost momentum in recent weeks
as no significant new evidence appeared.

<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton yesterday called for applications from cities and
rural areas seeking to be designated as 'empowerment zones' and to receive
tax breaks and federal grants.
The administration will pick six urban and three rural zones to benefit from
the new privileges of an empowerment zone, including wage credits for
businesses hiring local residents, extra tax write-offs and a 50 per cent
capital gains tax exclusion for small business investments.
Each urban empowerment zone - similar to what used to be called an
enterprise zone under Republican administrations - will also receive Dollars
100m in grants for social services; rural zones will get Dollars 40m each.
In another 95 'enterprise communities', small businesses will be allowed to
issue tax exempt bonds. These communities will also receive federal grants.
Several Indian reservations will also benefit.
'We have to give special attention to those areas that have been left behind
in the ghetto,' Vice-President Al Gore said yesterday at a White House
ceremony to launch the programme, which is expected to cost around Dollars
2.5bn in tax breaks and Dollars 1bn in grants.
The creation of urban enterprise zones was a central element in Mr Clinton's
election campaign, but the plan has been considerably modified by Congress.
Its scope has been reduced and rural communities added to placate powerful
congressional interests.

FT  18 JAN 94 / Liberals take axe to Canadian MPs' perks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Canada's newly-elected Liberal government has sent a symbolic message on the
eve of its first parliamentary session by abolishing some of the lavish
perks traditionally enjoyed by MPs.
In line with the goals of fiscal and social reform which are expected to
form the centrepiece of today's Throne Speech, the government has, among
other things, chopped MPs' CDollars 400 (Pounds 203)-a-year picture-framing
subsidy, imposed a charge for use of the parliamentary gym, and severely
curtailed free air-travel privileges.
Though minor in themselves, these cuts are a pointer to the Liberals'
strategy for outflanking the two regional parties - the separatist Bloc
Quebecois and the prairie-based Reform party - which dominate the opposition
benches.
The BQ won 54 seats, all from Quebec, in last October's general election,
putting it in the incongruous position of being the official opposition.
The Reform Party won 52 seats on a platform which included fiscal restraint,
and a promise of greater accountability by MPs to their constituents. The
Liberals have 177 seats in the new parliament.
Mr Jean Chretien, the prime minister, has indicated that he hopes to take
the wind out of the separatists' sails by emphasising economic and social
issues.
'If they (the BQ) want to talk about the constitution they will have a clean
and clear answer: we're here to solve the problems of unemployment and
economic growth,' Mr Chretien said at the weekend. 'The debate on separation
is not the reason why this Parliament will sit.'
The government will present its first budget next month. Mr Paul Martin,
finance minister, indicated that the tax base may be broadened to help bring
down the budget deficit from an estimated CDollars 45bn this year to around
CDollars 37bn in the year to March 31 1995.
But he said that some of the government's most far-reaching initiatives,
including an overhaul of the social-security system, will only be unveiled
in the 1995 budget.

Colombia's finance minister, Mr Rudolf Hommes, escaped unhurt in a bomb
attack on his armour-plated car yesterday morning. A bodyguard was injured.
The bomb was detonated as the minister's car crossed a flyover in the centre
of Bogota, the Colombian capital. Shrapnel shredded the vehicle's boot and
bent in a door.
Mr Hommes said later he had received death threats but did not know who
from. He has been finance minister for three-and-a-half years, responsible
for opening up the Colombian economy since the beginning of President Cesar
Gaviria's administration. Economic liberalisation and policies to reduce
inflation have become increasingly unpopular, particularly with the
political left.
The attack is being attributed to Communist guerrillas, though no
organisation claimed responsibility immediately. Guerrilla groups are
stepping up action in rural areas with the approach of congressional and
presidential elections, scheduled for March 13 and May 8.
They were blamed for recent bomb attacks in Bogota. On October 7 explosives
hidden at the side of a road were detonated by remote control as a busload
of police drove past. Three officers were killed and 30 injured. Just over
two weeks later a series of small bombs went off early on National Census
Day, killing a beggar.

FT  18 JAN 94 / Bishop at the heart of the struggle: Roots of Mexico's
revolt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Hailed by some as a saviour of Mexican tribal people, and attacked by others
as subversive radical, Bishop Samuel Ruiz of San Cristobal de las Casas has
emerged as the central figure in the search for a negotiated solution to the
uprising in the southern state of Chiapas.
A short man with thick glasses and grey hair, and fluent in tribal
languages, Monsignor Ruiz has been bishop at San Cristobal for the past 34
years. His passionate fight for the rights of indigenous people has pitted
him against the government, powerful local landlords and - most recently -
the country's conservative Catholic hierarchy.
Over the years, Bishop Ruiz, 69, has filled his diocese with a team of
radical priests, deacons and lay teachers fervently committed to the welfare
of indigenous people. A close-knit group which likes to communicate by
private radio, the bishop's followers are the most organised and powerful
force in the Chiapas indigenous community.
The federal government, which first attacked Bishop Ruiz for fuelling the
uprising, now sees his co-operation as critical to a long-term solution. Mr
Manuel Camacho Sols, the government's new commissioner for peace in the
area, last Friday accepted him as the mediator with the rebel Zapatista
guerrillas.
The bishop was nearly removed just two months ago. Mr Girolama Prigione, the
conservative papal nuncio in Mexico City, alleged that the diocese of San
Cristobal was 'full of friction - and not just now, but for the past 20
years, because Don Samuel Ruiz is responsible for grave pastoral, doctrinal
and government errors that conflict with the ministry of the church and
offend the Pope,' according to reports in newspapers.
The nuncio's demand for Bishop Ruiz's resignation was widely held to have
been pushed by Mr Patrocinio Gonzalez Garrido, a hardliner and then the
interior minister. He is a former governor of the state of Chiapas. The
resignation demand brought protest letters from abroad and vociferous
opposition from the tribal people whom Bishop Ruiz has defended.
Now that the pacification of the rebels has become Mexico's top priority,
the bishop's position is secure. He has been endorsed by the country's
leading bishops; Mr Gonzalez was asked to resign last Monday.
The bishop's radical views and his group's influence across the region has
raised questions over his involvement in the uprising. Many find it
difficult to believe that a group so well connected in the local community
could not have participated in the revolt.
Bishop Ruiz, while denying any involvement with the rebels, has called the
Chiapas uprising a 'historic opportunity' to address the oppression of
impoverished indigenous people. In his sermon last Sunday, he referred to
the Zapatista Army of National Liberation as 'brother insurgents'.
'Samuel Ruiz, like any revolutionary, has a way of thinking. It is not
Christian. It is the ideology of a revolutionary Christ, a fighting Christ,'
says Mr Gustavo Armendaris, a prominent businessmen and former minister in
the Chiapas state government, reflecting the view of many well-off people in
San Cristobal. 'He tells the Indians that we stole the land from their
fathers and grandfathers. He has stirred them up.'
Soon after the uprising, the local state government stated that the
'first-hand versions from residents in Ococingo and Las Margaritas indicate
that some Catholic priests and their deacons are tied in with the rebels and
help them with the system of radio communication from the San Cristobal
diocese.'
In the coffee town of El Bosque, two hours drive from San Cristobal, the
local authorities arrested and jailed several lay preachers who they
believed were planning an attack on the town. These work under Father Herve
Camier, a bearded and bespectacled French priest who supports liberation
theology.
Mr Julio Cesar Gonzalez, the town mayor, said: 'We began to hear rumours
that people were going to arrive from the villages where they back
liberation theology and start a revolt, so we started to organise ourselves,
and put the (lay preachers) in jail.
'A few hours later, hundreds of them came running with machetes, knives and
sticks, and freed the prisoners.'
Fr Camier dismisses such accusations, but says of the rebellion: 'It is
legitimate if the results compensate for the loss of life. We would not
choose this road but we do not judge those who do.' He says the catechists -
mainly indigenous lay people - may have kept their support for the rebels
from the priests, so as not to compromise their superiors.
In another town, the local priest, who preferred not to be named,
sympathised more explicitly with the rebels: 'They felt that the only answer
to their problems was to take up arms. They put on a military outfit and
declared war. It was their solution and it was a legal one.'

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Co-operation on defence and security issues between Britain and Japan could
be increased as part of a broader strengthening of the close bilateral
relationship, Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, suggested yesterday,
writes Alexander Nicoll, Asia Editor.
Mr Hurd, addressing a conference in London entitled 'Britain &amp; Japan: The
New Era,' said London and Tokyo had already discussed security. He asked
whether they could 'broaden defence staff talks, expand mutual visits
between service units and generally work for more sharing of experience and
know-how'.
He reiterated Britain's support for Japanese permanent membership of the
United Nations Security Council if it was enlarged.
Both Mr Hurd and Mr Hisashi Owada, an adviser to Mr Tsutomu Hata, Japan's
foreign minister, stressed the need for closer Japanese/European
co-operation as part of a tripartite structure with the US to build the
post-cold war world order.
Mr Owada said strengthening the UN Security Council was 'a problem of great
urgency and of utmost importance from the viewpoint of making it an organ
that can perform a truly central role in the new order based on co-operation
among nations'.

FT  18 JAN 94 / Cambodia delegation for China

The Cambodian government has sent a 40-member delegation to Beijing for a
five-day visit intended to lay to rest 30 years of Chinese support for the
Khmer Rouge, writes Iain Simpson in Phnom Penh.
The delegation, led by the country's two prime ministers, is also expected
to discuss arms sales and other defence issues with its Chinese hosts.
Beijing was the largest source of both political and military support for
the Khmer Rouge during its struggle for control of Cambodia in the 1970s,
after it came to power in 1975 and during the 12-year civil war that
followed its overthrow in 1979.
Thousands of Chinese advisers were sent to Phnom Penh during the radical
faction's four-year reign of the country, when hundreds of thousands of
Cambodians lost their lives to murder, starvation and disease.
Now, the Chinese government wants to show its Cambodian guests and the rest
of the world that those days are over and that Beijing now fully supports
the elected government in Phnom Penh and not the Khmer Rouge guerrillas who
are still fighting to bring the government down.

FT  18 JAN 94 / Zulus warn of resistance to new order: At least 12 people
have been killed in the violence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hundreds of heavily-armed Zulus fired handguns and rifles into the air
outside the seat of the government in Pretoria yesterday as the Zulu
monarch, King Goodwill Zwelithini, met Presidient F W de Klerk inside to
warn of Zulu resistance to the new constitution.
King Goodwill, accompanied by a delegation from the Zulu royal family and
Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, as well as some 15,000 of his followers, issued
what amounted to a final warning that his supporters will not take part in
the April vote unless constitutional changes are made to guarantee ethnic
Zulu self-determination.
As one young man in the crowd began to explain to me the importance of Zulu
self-determination, a shot rang out. The young man repeatedly assured me:
'Don't worry, be happy' as hundreds of men around us shot into the air.
The Pretoria gathering exacerbated high tensions in the townships around
Johannesburg, where fighting took place between mainly Zulu hostel dwellers
urging a work stay-away and township residents who sought to attend work.
Police said at least 12 people were killed, including one stabbed to death
at the rally.
Final constitutional amendments must be agreed by next Monday to be passed
by parliament before the constitution is signed into law on January 31.
After months of fruitless negotiations, officials from Chief Buthelezi's
Inkatha party and other right wing groups will meet the government and
African National Congress tomorrow for a final round of talks aimed at
reaching agreement before the deadline. Inkatha negotiators were last night
not hopeful of a deal.
King Goodwill's statement to President de Klerk insisted that participation
in the elections would mean 'national suicide' for the Zulus because the
constitution did not guarantee sufficient regional autonomy.
'The Zulus cannot accept that any majority in the rest of South Africa has
the right to decide our future.'
He issued a veiled threat of secession, asking: 'If we are not welcome in
the new South Africa through self-determination, then why should we remain
part of that kind of South Africa?'
Inkatha is due to make a final decision on participation in the elections
next weekend.

FT  18 JAN 94 / Gift-giving fails to lift store sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The year-end gift giving season has failed to stimulate sluggish Japanese
consumer spending, according to the latest figures from Tokyo department
stores, writes William Dawkins.
Sales at the 27 stores in and around the Japanese capital fell by 7.6 per
cent in December, against the same month last year, the 22nd monthly fall in
a row, the Japan department store association reported yesterday.
That brought Tokyo stores' total annual sales to Y2,510bn (Pounds 15.1bn),
down 9.6 per cent on 1992. A drop in traditional corporate year-end gift
giving contributed to the December sales decline, but the general trend
testifies to consumers' continued gloom at a time when the outlook for wages
and jobs is poor.
The gap between workers and employers is far wider than usual as the annual
spring wage round nears. The Nikkeiren employers' federation argues that
companies must freeze wages to preserve jobs, but the Rengo national trade
union federation argues that a rise of at least 5 per cent is needed to pull
the economy out of recession.

FT  18 JAN 94 / Bombay share index breaches 4,000 level
</HEADLINE>

   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Bombay Stock Exchange's index of leading stocks yesterday crossed the
psychologically-important 4,000 level for the first time in 21 months amid
hopes that next month's budget will bring new impetus to India's economic
liberalisation, writes Stefan Wagstyl in New Delhi.
Foreign financial institutions, which were admitted to the market only last
year, triggered the rally, which has seen the index rise 54 per cent since
the beginning of November. Yesterday, the index rose 82 points to close at
4020.87.
Shares are now approaching the record levels of the 1991-92 rally which
ended with the Bombay securities market scandal, more than doubling from
their post-scandal lows in the spring of last year, when sentiment was
depressed by the continuing investigation of the scandal and the religious
unrest following the sacking of the Ayodhya mosque.
Foreign investors have bought about Dollars 1bn in Indian equities and
Dollars 1.6bn in Indian companies' overseas issues, most of it since last
summer. Foreign fund managers are buying in the hope that India's reforms
will stimulate economic growth.
Managers of emerging funds are also seeking to diversify from east Asian
markets which could be set for declines after very rapid increases last
year.
Foreign fund managers have not been put off by a dispute between
stockbrokers and the Securities and Exchange Board of India, the markets
watchdog, which led to a two-week strike in December.
The brokers stopped work in protest at the board's order to sell positions
in an informal forward market called badla. The board alleged the forward
market was being used to generate excessive speculative demand for shares.
Despite the brokers' protests, the board has held firm and insists that
existing forward positions must be liquidated by early March. After that, it
proposes to allow forward deals only if they are reported separately from
cash transactions.
The board's efforts are expected to help improve transparency on India's 22
exchanges, including the Bombay exchange, which accounts for two thirds of
all trades.
The campaign against the badla market was spearheaded by Mr GV Ramakrishna,
SEBI's outspoken chairman, who moves to a lower profile position at the
government's Planning Commission.

FT  18 JAN 94 / Unions expect tough pay round: Companies are stiffening
their resolve
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As the first shots in Japan's spring wage offensive were delivered last
week, the country's labour unions braced themselves for what are expected to
be stiff negotiations in the next few months.
Mr Takeshi Nagano, chairman of the Japan Federation of Employers'
Associations (Nikkeiren) said yesterday little could be expected in the way
of wage increases.
'I am worried about whether this spring's labour negotiations can result in
wage increases, or whether we will even be able to support the labour force
(at current levels),' Mr Nagano told a group of businessmen.
The season will be particularly challenging for the Japanese Electrical,
Electronic and Information Union, which represents the country's electronics
and software industries.
As the union covering one of Japan's leading industries, and as one of the
largest unions in Rengo, Japan's Trade Union Confederation, the JEIU's
success or failure will be crucial in determining the outcome of talks for
other unions.
But the difficulty faced by Japan's electronics industry in the face of the
yen's rapid rise and the slump in domestic consumption has meant it will
take more than the usual negotiating skills to wrest favourable terms from
company managements.
The union, which represents 298 company unions and has a membership of
nearly 870,000, is seeking wage rises of 5 per cent, in line with the 5-6
per cent increase being put forward by Rengo.
The 5 per cent rise is a level which the JEIU sees as crucial in raising
real wages, stimulating consumption and leading the country out of its
economic woes.
According to a JEIU survey of member households, real wages fell last year,
while spending rose as a result of higher social security costs.
As a result, the unions also consider an income tax cut essential for
economic recovery and are highly critical of the Finance Ministry's position
that an income tax cut can only be made if there is a rise in the
consumption tax.
'It is against international common sense to increase taxes at a difficult
time like this,' says Mr Yukuo Ajima, bureau director of the JEIU.
The unions' position is being challenged on various fronts, not least by the
Nikkeiren.
The JEIU faces a particularly tough stand from employers, some of whom have
suggested that annual wage rises that are part of the employment contract
may have to be sacrificed this year.
'The electronics industry has been damaged (in the recession), and we expect
(the talks) to be very tough,' complains Mr Ajima.
In a bid to bolster the unions' prospects, Rengo members have discussed the
possibility of changing the order for when wage settlements are made for
each industrial sector.
Such order is crucial, since early settlements set the tone for deals made
for the rest of Japan's labour unions.
If high settlements can be agreed by the first in line, it is easier to
convince management at other industries to follow the lead with good offers.
Traditionally, the JEIU, together with the three other unions representing
Japan's leading industries of car, steel and shipbuilding, have been the
first to reach annual spring wage settlements, an arrangement that suited
the unions while times were good.
But since none of these industries are faring well in Japan's downturn,
union leaders are concerned that they might set a negative tone to overall
talks.
Nevertheless, there are no other candidates for the job, and the JEIU's Mr
Ajima is expecting tough talks ahead in the union's role as standard-bearer.
This year, the difference between the position put forward by the unions and
that maintained by the employers federation is even greater than last year,
when Rengo sought a 7 per cent wage hike.
Few people expect to see tensions rise to dangerous levels over the wage
issue. Japanese labour-management relations have not led to active union
protests for at least the past 10 years.
Nevertheless, Mr Ajima is not ruling out the possibility of strikes just
yet.

FT  18 JAN 94 / Israel cautious over Syrian offer on Golan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Israel reacted cautiously to Syrian peace gestures yesterday after US
officials said Washington believed Syria had broken new ground which held
out the prospect of real progress when both sides resume peace talks next
week.
Israeli officials said Mr Dennis Ross, US Middle East co-ordinator, had
sought to persuade the government that Syrian President Hafez-al-Assad had
given firm guarantees to President Bill Clinton in Geneva on Sunday he would
move to normal relations with Israel, including diplomatic and trade links,
if Israel was prepared to commit itself to Syrian sovereignty over the
entire Golan Heights.
Officials said Mr Ross had also told Israel Mr Clinton and Mr Assad had
discussed the possibility of stationing US troops on the Golan to meet
security and demilitarisation demands.
Mr Ross also reported that Mr Clinton had agreed to press for a public
meeting between Crown Prince Hassan of Jordan and Mr Simon Peres, Israeli
foreign minister, in Jordan when the US president meets King Hussein of
Jordan at the White House on Friday.
However, most Israeli officials believe Mr Assad made the minimum concession
in Geneva which, while being an important step forward, fell short of the
breakthrough US officials claim.
They say Mr Assad, either in public or in private talks with Mr Clinton, did
not go far enough to entice Israel to make a bold statement on return of the
Golan. 'A comprehensive peace means different things to Assad, the Americans
and to us,' said a foreign ministry official.
'For Assad a comprehensive peace still means the full withdrawal of Israel
to pre-1967 lines including in Jerusalem and the linkage of all issues
together and that is impossible for us.'
Jerusalem also believes that, while Mr Assad has spoken for the first time
in public, the words 'normal relations' meant little without a specific
timetable. 'If Assad sees normalisation as the last station of our trip and
the trip includes the resolution of all issues between us and the Arab world
then that is far short of enough to help the government win over public
opinion,' an official said.
Other Israelis believe the Clinton-Assad summit has forced Israel into a
difficult corner having won the Syrian leader an important US recognition of
its central strategic role in the region.
'(Assad's) main goal in the summit was reconciliation with the US,' said an
editorial in yesterday's respected Ha'aretz newspaper.
'He achieved this to a degree which should worry us. . . without even ending
his support of terrorism.'
Israel says it will not make a formal response until the peace talks restart
in Washington next Monday but it expects the peace process with Syria to
remain a long and difficult road. Any territorial concession in the Golan to
Syria may also have to be put to an election or national referendum.

FT  18 JAN 94 / Japanese investment in Europe falls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS and PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japanese industrial investment in Europe fell by nearly a quarter last year,
reflecting Japan's economic troubles and the shift of fresh production to
emerging Asian markets.
Japanese companies spent Dollars 7.06bn (Pounds 4.7bn) on 538 investments in
western Europe, Turkey and the former Soviet Union, in the year to last
July. This was a 24.7 per cent fall on the previous year, says a study by
the German Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Japan.
Europe's share of overall Japanese investment has also fallen slightly, from
22.5 per cent of the total to 20.7 per cent, but the chamber forecasts that
the region will remain an important production base for Japanese companies.
The drop 'reflects a certain investment saturation and the current economic
slump,' said the report.
The chamber predicts Japanese overseas investment will recover, due to the
erosion of domestic industry's competitiveness caused by the yen's
continuing strength, tough regulations on local content in foreign markets,
and international pressure to cut the trade surplus.
Of the European total, 70.8 per cent of investments were in manufacturing
industry, mainly cars, electronics and chemicals and pharmaceuticals. Only 7
per cent of overall Japanese industrial production is based offshore,
against 25 per cent of US production.
Britain remains Japan's favourite industrial location by a long way, with
Dollars 2.95bn of investment in the survey period, followed by the
Netherlands with Dollars 1.45bn, Germany with Dollars 769m and France with
Dollars 456m.
At the same time, the number and scale of foreign acquisitions in Japan
declined last year, according to accountants KPMG Peat Marwick. Foreign
groups announced only 35 acquisitions compared with 43 in 1992. Purchasers
disclosed the value of 11 deals last year worth Y16bn (Pounds 96m), compared
with 26 deals in 1992 worth Y62bn.
Stryker Corporation's 20 per cent stake in Matsumoto Medical Instruments was
the largest non-Japanese acquisition in 1993, but was worth only Y3.3bn.
KPMG said the lengthy and complex nature of purchasing Japanese companies
explained the absence of significant deals last year.
The largest proportion of Japanese companies acquired last year were
family-owned groups. Only one listed company was purchased. Of the foreign
acquisitions last year, five were in the pharmaceuticals industry, five in
the computer or software sectors, four in chemicals and four in industrial
machinery.
US companies concluded the largest number of purchases.

Evidence of a slight pick-up in industrial demand emerged yesterday, with a
1.5 per cent rise in Japanese crude steel production for 1993, the first
year-on-year increase in three years. Yet annual steel output at 99.6m
tonnes remained below 100m tonnes, the threshold at which the industry
gauges its long term survival, for the second year running.

The political future of the East Malaysian state of Sabah has been thrown
into confusion with the conviction of Mr Joseph Pairin Kitingan, the state's
chief minister, on corruption charges, writes Kieran Cooke in Singapore.
After a trial lasting more than a year Mr Kitingan was found guilty of
awarding contracts worth MDollars 1.48m (Pounds 360,000) to a company owned
by relatives.
Mr Kitingan is leader of the state's ruling Parti Bersatu Sabah (PBS),
which, shortly before general elections in 1990, left Malaysia's ruling
National Front coalition led by Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the prime minister.
Mr Kitingan was arrested soon after the elections and his supporters have
accused leaders of the government in Kuala Lumpur of victimisation. High
Court judge Mr Denis Ong said he was satisfied that Mr Kitingan had abused
his official position as chief minister. However he received a fine so small
as to allow him to lead his tribal-based party at elections next month. Mr
Ong fined him MDollars 1,800, just MDollars 200 short of the amount that
would have barred him from holding public office.

Ms Bishop will become the opposition spokesperson for urban and regional

FT  18 JAN 94 / OECD warns Italy on debt and deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Italy's budget deficit and national debt remain 'extremely high', despite
recent progress, the OECD warns in its annual country report.
The report points out that the 1993 budget deficit was 9.7 per cent of GDP,
while public debt was 114 per cent of GDP and likely to rise. It concludes
that substantial fiscal adjustment is still required, while 'several years
of sustained efforts' will be needed to meet EU convergence targets.
The latest annual report on Italy recognises, however, that since 1992 both
the Amato and Ciampi governments have begun to tackle the country's public
finances. In particular, the 1993 budget was a landmark, the OECD says, as
the first in which structural deficit-reducing measures were given weight,
compared with the 'recurrent one-off relief steps taken in the past'.
The authorities' 'impressive action' to address the public debt problem has
been assisted by falling interest rates and a sharp rise in export
competitiveness, thanks to the lira's devaluation and labour agreements
limiting wage rises.
The report forecasts exports will continue to expand, thanks to low nominal
wage growth, enlarging the trade surplus to 3 per cent of GDP by 1995. The
buoyancy of exports may suffice to keep real GDP in 1993 at the previous
year's level, the weakest output performance in nearly 20 years.
GDP is set to recover slightly this year, up by 1.7 per cent at the most
optimistic, but the report envisages only a gradual recovery in 1995.
Given the modest level at which activity is projected to pick-up, employment
may remain 'virtually flat, causing the rate of unemployment to climb to
11.7 per cent in the second half of 1995', it says.
'Larger employment losses and greater job security could stimulate
precautionary savings, delaying the revival of private consumption and gross
fixed investment.' Against that background the OECD says Italy's
international credibility depends on a good budgetary record, which will
also allow risk premiums in interest rates to ease further.
The successful execution of the government's privatisation programme is
another key aspect of such credibility.
The report contains a special chapter on privatisation, which is critical of
the slow and complex decision-making process. By using unorthodox
privatisation procedures, Italy risks losing out in the competition to
attract equity funds, it says. The authorities have also failed to come up
with regulatory reform of public utilities.

Olivetti yesterday agreed with trade unions to cut nearly 2,000 jobs as part
of a plan to restructure the loss-making Italian computer group, Reuter
reports from Rome.
The pact included 'solidarity contracts' under which employees work shorter
hours and take a cut in wages, making Olivetti the first large Italian
industrial group to adopt this measure.
Olivetti has about 37,000 employees, down from over 55,000 five years ago.

FT  18 JAN 94 / Italian Christian Democrats find a new identity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
After more than a year agonising over their future identity Italy's
long-ruling Christian Democrats will this week transform themselves into the
Popular party, a new centrist Catholic grouping.
The move follows the dissolution of parliament and the fixing of early
general elections on March 27. The change of identity is an attempt to find
a new appeal in the centre-ground of Italian politics - the traditional core
of their electorate - after the damage done by the country's corruption
scandals.
The name is designed to evoke the party founded in 1919 by Mr Luigi Sturzo,
which is regarded as the forerunner of the Christian Democrats, themselves
founded in 1942. The Socialists are also due to change their name, as is the
neo-fascist MSI. The first party to transform itself was the former
Communist party which became the Party of the Democratic Left in 1991, with
a rump founding a party called Reconstructed Communism.
The statutes of the new party are to be finalised today and an inaugural
congress is due at the weekend. However, the party, headed for the past 18
months by the sepulchral but canny Mr Mino Martinazzoli, remains divided.
New electoral laws have meant that parties must form alliances if they wish
to govern, but the nascent party has not yet decided who it should go into
alliance with. Mr Martinazzoli is considering three centre groupings - the
populist Northern League of Mr Umberto Bossi, the newly formed Pact for
Italy of Mr Mario Segni, the referendum leader, and supporters of media
magnate, Mr Silvio Berlusconi, who is anxious to form a party.
However, any one of these alliances risks reshaping the identity of the new
Popular party without necessarily assuring electoral success. Much also
depends upon whether Mr Berlusconi, who has delayed an announcement for more
than six weeks, decides to enter the fray in person. Also, an important
minority among the Christian Democrats sees its future in alliance with the
left.

FT  18 JAN 94 / Finns embrace a fresh political future: The two maverick
candidates who face a run-off in the presidential election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Judging by the outcome of Sunday's first round of voting in the presidential
election, Finns are seeking new faces to lead them out of the gloom that has
enveloped the country for the past three years.
Confronted with 11 candidates on Sunday, the electorate plumped for the two
who clearly offered a break from the political conventions of the past. Mr
Martti Ahtisaari, who won the first round of voting, is a United Nations
diplomat who based his candidacy on his non-political background (although
he represents the Social Democratic party) and his lack of any
responsibility for the crippling recession of the 1990s that has pushed
unemployment in Finland to approaching 20 per cent of the workforce.
But he may yet be undone by Mrs Elizabeth Rehn, who swept from nowhere a
month ago to take second place. Excluding postal votes which were cast
earlier, Mrs Rehn won more votes on Sunday than Mr Ahtisaari. The two will
meet in a second vote on February 6.
Although a member - as defence minister - of the unpopular centre-right
coalition of Mr Esko Aho, the prime minister, Mrs Rehn has presented herself
as a breath of fresh air in Finland's stul-tified politics with spectacular
success.
As a member of the small Swedish-speaking minority, she is a genuine
outsider. But it is as a plain-speaking woman, with a disarming sense of
humour, that she has captured the imagination, especially of women and young
voters.
When she jokes about the over-inclination of Finnish men to make policy in
the sauna, she raises a laugh - but also strikes a chord with voters fed up
with what they see as a cliquey political establishment.
Nor is she afraid to be optimistic. 'Finns are a little bit masochistic  -
we have been concentrating on how bad things have been. But there are signs
of light,' she says.
Both Mr Ahtisaari and Mrs Rehn admitted on Sunday night that they were
broadly in agreement on the foreign policy issues that are the main concerns
of the president.
Both are keen advocates of Finland's application to join the European Union
and say they will not remain neutral when the issue is put to a referendum,
probably in the autumn.
Both lay great emphasis on maintaining neutral Finland's security, a highly
sensitive issue for a country with a long border and a history of military
conflict with Russia.
Mrs Rehn gives nothing away on this to the internationally-experienced Mr
Ahtisaari as she has been a well-respected defence minister.
Wary of upsetting Moscow, Mr Ahtisaari and Mrs Rehn avoid making specific
commitments on how Finland's strategic stance may develop in the wake of the
collapse of the Soviet Union, beyond the application to join the EU.
However, options such as moving within the Nato sphere are left open.
Where the two candidates differ most is on the economy - the most important
election issue and the one on which Mrs Rehn is most vulnerable.
She has not shied away from supporting the government's tough fiscal
policies which, although to the long-term benefit of the health of the
public finances, have added to the pain imposed by the long recession.
Mr Ahtisaari believes in more public investment and less stringent spending
cuts.
In fact, the outlook is much brighter this year than it has been since the
the economy began to contract three years ago. Due largely to a powerful
export boom - itself fuelled by a crash in the value of the Finnish markka -
gross domestic product is set to grow by up to 2 per cent this year,
compared with a fall of around 2.5 per cent in 1993.
Inflation, currently running at less than 1.5 per cent despite the
devaluation, is under control and the government was encouraged last autumn
by a series of pay agreements with the traditionally tough trade unions
which led to wage cuts in the public sector.
The finance ministry talks of 'buoyant growth' in 1995.
But even the most optimistic forecasts see unemployment remaining high for
the rest of the decade, probably staying in double figures at least until
1998.
'We should not settle for this,' insists Mr Ahtisaari.
Mrs Rehn, now the favoured candidate of the political right, may find her
new-found popularity dented in the economic debate.
However, as she remarked on Sunday night, the presidential election, the
first by universal suffrage, is turning out to be as much about personality
as issues.
And on that score Mrs Rehn is a winner.

FT  18 JAN 94 / Aviation sector appeals to Bonn for subsidies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Germany's crisis-hit aerospace industry yesterday called on the Bonn
government to draw up an emergency subsidy programme to enable the sector to
survive and compete with US and Asian manufacturers.
At a meeting near Bonn, 300 industry leaders spelt out a string of demands
for government support to stem the current spate of job losses.
Mr Hartmut Mehdorn, the Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa) director responsible for
aerospace, whose company has announced 16,000 redundancies from its
80,000-strong workforce, said that if government and industry failed to
agree a 'new priority' for aerospace, Germany would fall behind its
competitors in the technology.
He set out a 10-point programme, including direct research subsidies of up
to DM340m (Pounds 132.8m) a year for new technologies, including helicopter
and aerospace equipment - but not engine research. He also called for direct
grants of DM25m per year to develop a new extra-large air freighter to
replace the Transall.
He urged the government to match the huge programme of indirect aerospace
promotion conducted by the US government, through both Nasa, the space
agency, and the military procurement programme.
He said President Bill Clinton had given a new lease of life to the US
industry, both through research promotion, and 'by not being too proud to
act as a carpet-trader on behalf of Boeing products throughout the world'.
The plight of the German industry has aroused widespread sympathy in the
country. The industry is a big employer in the conservative states of
Bavaria and Baden-Wurttemberg, but also the Social Democrat-ruled states of
Bremen, Hamburg and Lower Saxony in northern Germany. Mr Reinhard Gohner,
the state secretary responsible for aerospace, who convened the meeting,
said he hoped that more indirect research support could be made available.

FT  18 JAN 94 / Rouble declines to low against Dollars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Russian rouble fell to a low of 1,402 to the dollar yesterday. The
latest decline, of 3.5 per cent over last week, was blamed by currency
dealers on the resignation of Mr Yegor Gaidar, first deputy prime minister,
from his cabinet post. The Russian currency has fallen 12 per cent this
year.
However, the dealers say much of the fall since the December elections has
been prompted by a belief that the relatively tight monetary policy pursued
by Mr Boris Fyodorov, deputy premier for finance, would be relaxed, and the
inflation rate of 12 per cent a month would accelerate.
A range of spending decisions - including Dollars 500m on a new parliament
building - and a draft agreement to unify the economies of Russia and
Belarus point to relaxation of monetary controls. A new US investment fund
said yesterday it would go ahead with plans to invest Dollars 340m of
capital, put up by the US government in small and medium-sized enterprises
in Russia.
Mr Gerald Corrigan, chairman of the Russia-American Investment Fund, a
former chairman of the New York Federal Reserve and a long-time participant
in the Russian reform process, said yesterday that 'irrespective of the
political changes, we believe that there is a lot of business here in which
profitable investments can be made'.
The fund has appointed Mr Robert Towbin, a former managing director of
Lehman Brothers in New York, as the fund's chief executive officer. Mr
Towbin said yesterday that the fund would concentrate investments in
consumer industries, especially food and food processing, furniture and
financial and other services.
'This is the area in which I think, on an early view, there will be most
opportunities,' Mr Towbin said. 'We will put a lot of work into looking at
these companies before we make an investment - and we will make a purely
business judgment at the end of the day.'
The fund plans to employ more than 30 executives in Moscow, both foreigners
and Russian nationals, to investigate investment opportunities in the
growing sector of privatised companies.
It is a non-profit-making organisation which will invest all profit back in
the Russian economy.
Mr Corrigan said that 'what falls beneath the cracks in people's view of
Moscow is the sheer amount of private activity taking place at the micro
level in the economy. My belief is that this means that the GDP of the
country is no longer falling (as official figures show) but beginning to
rise again'.
Reuter adds: Moscow is to charge foreign tourists a daily tariff of one US
dollar, payable in hard currency, Itar-Tass news agency said.
The agency did not say when or how the tariff would be collected or why it
was imposed. Officials at the mayor's office were not immediately available
for comment.

FT  18 JAN 94 / Concern at EU policy weakness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A French initiative to strengthen the political leadership of the European
Union in the run-up to the Maastricht treaty review conference in 1996 has
highlighted weaknesses in its provisions for a common foreign and security
policy.
Diplomats and European Commission officials said yesterday that Mr Alain
Lamassoure, France's European affairs minister, had pinpointed the lack of a
proper structure to prepare and execute 'joint actions' such as the
organisation of aid to the Israeli-occupied territories and
political-military action in Bosnia. 'It's all been a bit amateurish so
far,' said one Brussels official.
Mr Lamassoure expressed concern about weaknesses in the management of EU
foreign policy in an interview with the Financial Times. He also disclosed
that France, in concert with Germany, Italy and Spain, was planning a more
coherent leadership for the EU during their successive presidencies in
1994-96.
The French initiative did not appear to be an attempt to establish a
big-country directorate of the EU, nor intended to be a slight on the
current Greek presidency.
The 1991 Maastricht treaty is an elaborate compromise between federalism and
looser co-operation between governments. Although it provides for a common
foreign and security policy, signatories, most notably France and the UK,
were admanantly opposed at the time to diluting national sovereignty in
foreign policy.
France appears to have grasped that the present arrangement may be too loose
for effective action. However, its unwillingness to see the Commission or
the Council of Ministers' secretariat filling the vacuum underlines the
limited scope it sees for ceding power to new EU machinery, such as the
policy unit set up by Mr Hans Van den Broek, political affairs commissioner.
A senior Brussels official noted that the Commission had no policy planning
staff, nor did it have an in-house foreign policy think tank. There was
scope for creating something more permanent, he suggested.
These ideas may arouse some discomfort in London. Despite nominal support
for the concept of a common European foreign policy, UK ministers prefer
looser arrangements with limited goals.

FT  18 JAN 94 / GM move on Russian assembly plants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
General Motors, the US carmaker, has signed a memorandum of understanding
with VAZ, the Russian producer of Lada cars, which could eventually lead to
the assembly of GM cars in Russia.
The two companies have agreed to conduct a feasibility study into the
production of the Opel/Vauxhall Corsa small car at the VAZ assembly plant at
Togliatti.
GM Europe said yesterday that the initial study should be completed by the
spring. The study will examine the suitability of the Opel Corsa for the
Russian market and the economic feasibility of producing the car in Russia.
Officials from the two companies met last week in Paris, and it is expected
that the study team will be led by GM's Opel technical development centre at
Russelsheim near Frankfurt.
The Opel/Vauxhall Corsa, which was launched in Europe a year ago, is built
at GM's European plants at Zaragoza, Spain and at Eisenach in eastern
Germany. It will also be produced at GM plants in Brazil and Mexico.
Discussions between GM and VAZ are still at a very preliminary stage, but
the US vehicle maker has developed close contacts with the Russian carmaker
in recent years as a supplier of components.
GM's Automotive Components Group Worldwide began shipping production parts
for engine management systems to VAZ last summer.

<TEXT>
European entrepreneurs believe Europe could start to emerge from recession
this year, but recovery will be slow and the employment crisis will persist.
Those are the main findings of a survey of 100,000 small and medium-sized
companies, carried out in November by Eurochambres, the European association
of chambers of commerce.
A survey of 5,000 European companies published last week was similarly
gloomy about the immediate prospects for an end to the effects of recession.
Accountancy firm Grant Thornton and the consultancy Business Strategies,
which plan to publish the full survey in May, concluded that smaller
businesses expected no rise in profitability, employment or investment this
year.
Eurochambres' survey of business prospects - the first and probably the
largest of its kind - found clear differences in expectations across the EU.
British entrepreneurs were among the most optimistic about prospects for
1994, while about a third of the west German companies questioned expected
business to develop unfavourably this year.
Sir Tommy Macpherson, president of Eurochambres, yesterday warned the
European Commission and national governments not to ignore small and
medium-sized companies. He said that they would provide the main source of
employment growth in the coming years.

United Nations officials in Geneva were reported yesterday to have rejected
the use of air strikes against Serb targets as proposed under a Nato
initiative.
Mr Yasushi Akashi, the UN special envoy, following his fact-finding mission
on the feasibility of air strikes, met UN political and aid officials. He
came out against the use of air power to open the airport in Tuzla, the
biggest government stronghold, and to secure the rotation of Canadian
peace-keepers in Srebrenica, the Moslem enclave in eastern Bosnia.
He reportedly indicated that air support would stop overland aid convoys to
Tuzla and said agreement had been reached to allow Dutch troops to relieve
the Canadian company in Srebrenica.
In Geneva today the leaders of Bosnia's warring communities resume partition
talks against a backdrop of intensified fighting and few positive
indications of peace. Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, told the
assembly of his self-styled Serb state that the Moslems would be faced with
'all-out war' if the peace talks failed to yield an agreement.

FT  18 JAN 94 / CDU seeks cheap foreign labour curbs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The ruling Christian Democrats in Germany are calling for tough measures to
crack down on the employment of cheap foreign labour and a national
initiative to promote part-time work and flexible hours, in a bid to counter
rising unemployment.
The economic programme of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic
Union, approved at the weekend by the party's national executive, calls for
companies employing illegal labour to be blacklisted for public sector
contracts. At the same time, it wants special measures to allow long-term
unemployed in Germany to be hired for low wages - below the industry minima
fixed by national wage contracts.
As for part-time working, the CDU is calling for a 'national offensive' to
increase the numbers, arguing that at least 2m extra jobs could be created.
The controversial document was drawn up by a working group chaired by Mr
Klaus Topfer, the environment minister, and it lays great stress on the need
to promote new technologies, including environmental technology, to maintain
German competitiveness internationally.
Shortly after the proposals were published, an inner circle of government
ministers agreed on measures to prune a further DM5bn (Dollars 2.9bn) in
spending this year, in an effort to keep the federal government's borrowing
requirement below DM70bn. The defence ministry will bear the brunt of the
latest cuts, with DM1.2bn, followed by the transport and employment
ministries. Further savings of DM2.5bn have yet to be found.
The CDU programme calls for continuing strict control over public spending,
and in particular for state spending on social programmes to ease
redundancies in the private sector to be converted from grants to loans.
It also proposes the creation of a National Technology Council to
co-ordinate research, promote rapid industrial application of German
inventions and intervene in a national debate which often appears hostile to
innovation.
The programme calls for joint efforts between the government and the banking
sector to make more venture capital available, with attractive tax
incentives, for high-risk projects. It singles out transport investment for
special emphasis, through private sector investment in roads and high-tech
projects such as the Transrapid magnetic hover-train.
The proposed job creation measures are likely to prove controversial in the
election campaign, relying as they do on drastic deregulation of the labour
market.

FT  18 JAN 94 / Exports may speed German recovery
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
An increase in exports and further interest rate cuts could lift total
investment in western Germany by 3 per cent in 1994, the Munich-based
economic institute Ifo said in a report yesterday.
More foreign orders, particularly from outside Europe, should stimulate a
gradual recovery in investment this year, the institute said, after a
dramatic 14.7 per cent plunge in 1993.
'Signs increasingly show that the bottom of the pit has been reached in
terms of investment. If there are no new handicaps to exports, companies
will increase their investment as they modernise and face replacement
needs,' the report says.
The main growth in investment will come in the energy and service sectors.
But west German industry will continue to feel the after-effects of the 1993
recession. Industrial investment could still fall by 5 per cent, the
institute noted. 'But, without this noticeable change in demand, investment
would have fallen by a double-digit figure this year too.'
However, the institute warned that investment in 1994 would remain subject
to growth in the European Union and to Germany's monetary policies.
It stressed that investment could fall by 1 per cent if interest rates were
not lowered and a pick-up in economic activity was not seen in neighbouring
EU countries.
Ifo recently added its voice to a growing chorus calling on the Bundesbank
to help push the economy out of the recession with lower interest rates. The
call had followed earlier accusations from the DiW institute in Berlin that
the Bundesbank's go-slow policy was prolonging the recession.
Yesterday's warning was also in line with polls conducted by Ifo last autumn
in which 40 per cent of west German companies said they did not plan to
increase investment, against just 18 per cent reporting otherwise.
In eastern Germany, the report noted that investment would continue to
increase in 1994, following a 15 per cent rise last year. Investment would
be particularly concentrated in the public transport, mining, energy and
services sectors.

FT  18 JAN 94 / Bank chief eases fears of small companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, last night argued that
antagonism between banks and small companies was easing, and companies were
unlikely to be constrained from recovery by a lack of finance.
Mr George spoke after publishing a bank inquiry which found that tension had
been heightened by 'exaggerated expectations on one side, and insensitivity
on the other', but was caused mainly by the high rate of company failures.
The bank's largely optimistic conclusion was welcomed by groups representing
small businesses. The Confederation of British Industry said it would raise
the quality of debate on an issue of crucial importance to the economy.
High street banks also welcomed the results, including the finding that
banks were 'committed to the finance of the small firm sector', and that
companies recognised that banks were 'not public utilities' and had to make
profits.
The inquiry was conducted by Mr George last year after his appointment as
governor. It followed two studies by the Bank on terms set by the
government, which cleared banks of not passing on interest rate cuts.
Sir Nicholas Goodison, president of the British Bankers' Association,
welcomed the findings. He said earlier inquiries had been 'politically
motivated' and too narrow.
The Bank's report criticised banks for having shown 'a lack of
sophistication and sensitivity in their dealings with small businesses',
particularly in setting charges and taking securities against loans. But Mr
George emphasised in a speech to the Scottish CBI and Scottish Enterprise
last night that he was 'very encouraged' by the inquiry, and by 'the extent
and variety of initiatives' taken by banks, small companies and the
government.
He said that improving access to finance for Britain's 2.5m small companies
was best tackled in 'many small steps across a wide front'. The damage
inflicted on banks and small companies was rooted in the economic volatility
of the past five years, and stable low-inflationary growth would 'go a long
way to reducing the tensions'.
The inquiry concluded that banks should offer businesses a wider range of
finance than overdrafts. It also suggested that venture capitalists and
'business angels' should be encouraged.

FT  18 JAN 94 / PM's decision on dam project
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major took the final decision to sign an aid deal with the Malaysian
government which a top Whitehall mandarin described yesterday as an 'abuse'
of taxpayers' money. The programme, to build a hydroelectric dam on
Malaysia's Pergau river, has cost the UK government more than Pounds 300m
and is the largest expenditure ever incurred on a single project by the
Overseas Development Agency.

FT  18 JAN 94 / Sega plans link-up with Microsoft for new video game
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sega, the Japanese group, plans a link-up with Microsoft of the US to
develop an advanced video games machine in a venture with far-reaching
implications for the world electronics industry.
The deal could give Microsoft, which provides software for more than 90 per
cent of the world's business personal computers, similar dominance in the
market for home entertainment.
The venture was confirmed by Sega, although Microsoft would not be drawn
last night on any relationship with the Japanese group, saying reports were
'speculative'.
According to Sega, the companies will co-operate on the Saturn project, a
games console combining video images, stereo sound and telecommunications.
Sega will make the computers and Microsoft will provide the operating
software.
Microsoft's software for Saturn would give the machine advanced graphics and
data processing capabilities, although it would be cheaper than standard
home computers.
Co-operation between Microsoft and Sega could lead to a new industry
standard for home entertainment software. The US company has grown to a
turnover of Dollars 3.75bn (Pounds 2.53bn) in 10 years through licensing
deals that put its software on every IBM and IBM clone of personal computer.
The implication is that software houses developing educational and games
programs might have to write their products to Microsoft's standard, just as
business software developers have to work with Microsoft's MS-Dos and
Windows operating system.
The prospective tie-up comes as other companies in the video games,
electronics and computer industries have been taking positions in
preparation for what is expected to be fierce competition ahead.
Nintendo of Japan and Silicon Graphics, the US company, agreed last year to
co-operate in developing Nintendo's advanced games machine. Matsushita, the
consumer electronics company, has brought out an advanced games machine
developed by the US venture company 3DO. Sega has already formed an alliance
with TeleCommunications, the US cable TV company, and entertainment group
Time-Warner.

FT  18 JAN 94 / Shocks hit LA after quake kills 24
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   LOS ANGELES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Los Angeles residents last night feared further damage to their homes as
after-shocks hit the city following a severe earthquake that left at least
24 people dead.
Emergency shelters quickly filled up and thousands of people were evacuated
from damaged homes in the San Fernando Valley, a suburban expanse of about
3m inhabitants. Seismic experts warned of a 1 in 4 chance of another big
earthquake in coming days.
President Bill Clinton declared southern California a federal disaster area,
paving the way for low-interest loans and emergency funds, after yesterday's
quake which measured 6.6 on the Richter scale and badly disrupted transport
and communications. About 100 fires broke out around the city as gas pipes
ruptured while 1m people were left without power.
In the suburban town of Northridge, the epicentre of the quake north-west of
central Los Angeles, emergency workers pulled 14 bodies out of a
three-storey block of flats that partly caved in. 'It was like a bomb going
off,' said a third-floor resident who escaped over a balcony. 'One big jolt,
it lifted the building up off its foundation, pulled it over and slammed it
down within a three-second period.'
People were also feared trapped inside a collapsed multi-storey car park at
Northridge's shopping centre. Officials said a streetsweeper was still alive
even though tons of rubble had fallen on his vehicle.
In Sylmar in the San Fernando valley aerial television photographs showed
whole streets in flames. Residents of a Sylmar mobile-home park huddled
together, sobbing and embracing each other, as they watched their trailer
homes go up in flames. Dozens of cars lining the streets exploded from the
intense heat of gas fires.
Reports said that 50 buildings in Hollywood were also destroyed and the
quake caused many houses to slide off their foundations. Up to 1,000
buildings in the city were damaged, including two hospitals, which have been
closed. Other hospitals said they were 'inundated with walking wounded' and
officials said transport conditions were 'horrendous'.
The earthquake, which was felt 300 miles away in Las Vegas, struck at 4.31am
Pacific Standard Time, according to the US Geological Service. Had it struck
two hours later, in the rush hour, fatalities would probably have been much
higher, officials said. Yesterday's Martin Luther King holiday also meant
that many businesses were closed.
Among the dead was a motorcycle policeman thrown off a highway when the
quake split the road in two. Several raised freeways to the north and west
of the city collapsed. The Santa Monica freeway, the busiest in the US, was
severely damaged.
Most of the main arteries to and through the San Fernando Valley were badly
damaged. The entire area was without water.
The stark pictures of the pancaked roadways in Los Angeles, the US's second
biggest city, are reminiscent of the 1989 San Francisco earthquake, which
registered 7.1 on the Richter scale, and in which more than 50 people died.
Repairs and reinforcements to San Francisco's freeway system are not
expected to be completed for another two years.
The city's airports, which were closed immediately after the earthquake,
reopened by mid-morning. However, delays were exacerbated by more than 200
after-shocks, including four measuring over 5 on the Richter scale.
Telephone services to the Los Angeles area were yesterday limited to
emergency calls and 1,500 national guards were deployed to assist emergency
workers, amid reports of looting.

FT  18 JAN 94 / UK figures point to strong growth and low inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A clutch of economic statistics yesterday added to recent evidence that the
UK is enjoying an unusually favourable combination of strengthening growth
and low inflation.
December's producer price index shows that companies did not pass on the
full amount of the Budget increases in excise duties. 'Inflation is under
better control than it has been for a quarter of a century' claimed Mr
Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the UK Treasury.
Other economic news pointed to a robust growth picture:
December retail sales volumes recorded their highest annual increase since
April 1990, according to the Confederation of British Industry's
distributive trades survey. The rise in sales was felt across the industry
and confirms anecdotal evidence of a buoyant Christmas shopping season.
November's industrial production figures indicate that output has returned
to pre-recessionary levels, with the index reaching 100.2 (1990 = 100). Over
the three months to November, the annual increase in production was 2.7 per
cent, compared with the same period in 1992.
Manufacturing output in the three months to November was 0.8 per cent higher
than in the previous three months and 1.8 per cent higher than in the same
period in 1992. The Central Statistical Office revised upwards, from 1 to
1.5 per cent, its estimate for the annual trend in manufacturing output
growth.
Unit wage costs in the manufacturing sector rose by 0.2 per cent in the
three months to November, compared with the same period in 1992.
Productivity measures continued to improve with increases in manufacturing
output per person employed, and per working hour.
The labour cost statistics, which showed a lower increase than expected,
backed up the evidence of producer prices that UK industry faces restrained
cost pressures. The producers' output price index rose by 0.5 per cent
between November and December. Although this was higher than expected, and
pushed the annual increase up to 4 per cent, from 3.6 per cent in November,
the CSO said if the Budget rise in excise duties had been passed on in full,
the monthly rise would have been 0.7 per cent. The main reason was that
lower crude oil prices offset higher excise duties on petrol.

FT  18 JAN 94 / Major distances himself from Iraq arms sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS and KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major yesterday followed his predecessor Lady Thatcher in publicly
distancing himself from any responsibility in the arms-for-Iraq affair.
In a generally assured performance before the Scott inquiry which his
officials hoped would help restore some of his political authority, Mr Major
said that at no stage either as a cabinet minister nor as prime minister had
he played any role in setting guidelines on defence exports to Iraq or in
relaxing them.
He also denied that he had played any role in the decision by his ministers
and the attorney general Sir Nicholas Lyell to issue public immunity
certificates withholding information in the trial of three businessmen from
the Midlands machine tool company, Matrix Churchill.
Mr Major's appearance before the inquiry, which he agreed to in November
1992 under intense political pressure following the collapse of the Matrix
Churchill trial, marked the first time that a serving British prime minister
has given evidence to a judge in public.
But yesterday's low-key public hearing before a packed audience of
journalists, members of the public, Whitehall officials, and some opposition
MPs, contrasted with the drama of some previous encounters between Lord
Justice Scott and witnesses.
Mr Major said the first time he saw an official document referring to more
'flexible' government guidelines was in July 1989 while he was foreign
secretary, but said he did not consider this to amount to any important
change of policy.
'Neither at that stage, nor later, was I involved in the formulation of the
guidelines, consideration of the guidelines, amendment of the guidelines or
interpretation of the guidelines,' Mr Major said.
Exchanges between the prime minister and the inquiry's counsel, Miss
Presiley Baxendale QC remained polite and mutually respectful, in stark
contrast to the sharp words exchanged when Lady Thatcher gave evidence.
Only once did he seem rattled, when he was referred to his correspondence
with Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, in October 1992 confirming that
junior ministers had secretly agreed to the export of machine-tools which
they knew could be arguably in breach of government guidelines.
Questioned about ministerial accountability, Mr Major agreed that ministers
were responsible to parliament for the conduct of their departments and were
accountable for the organisation of their departments. He identified Sir
Robin Butler, the cabinet secretary, as the man who should put right any
failings in the dissemination of intelligence.
That statement may haunt ministers who have given evidence to the inquiry,
and those yet to appear, including Sir Robin.
Mr Major seemed to draw strength from the inquiry's reference showing him
opposing the sale of Hawk jets to Iraq on financial and moral grounds, as
well as making agonising efforts behind the scenes to ensure that replies to
parliament at the height of the Matrix Churchill furore were accurate.
Both Mr Major and Lord Justice Scott steered clear of reference to last
week's attack on the inquiry by Lord Howe, the former foreign secretary.
Mr Major's confident performance reduces the potential for the Scott inquiry
to destabilise his leadership.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said the prime
minister's performance showed that he was still capable of providing the
strong leadership being demanded by backbench critics.
Mr Major's assertion that he did not know about the government's internal
debate over the guidelines for arms-related exports was ridiculed by Labour.
Mr Robin Cook, the shadow trade and industry secretary, said the prime
minister's evidence was clear but discreditable.

FT  18 JAN 94 / Earthquake causes heavy damage in Los Angeles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A severe earthquake in Los Angeles yesterday left at least 10 people dead
and caused widespread damage and disruption to transport and communications.
The quake, which measured 6.6 on the Richter scale, caused about 100 fires
in and around the city as gas pipes ruptured.
In Sylmar in the San Fernando valley, where an estimated 70 homes were
destroyed, aerial television photographs showed whole streets in flames. In
San Fernando suburb, dozens of cars lining the streets exploded from the
intense heat of gas fires. At least a half dozen vehicles were burning on
one street.
Reports said that 50 buildings in Hollywood were also destroyed and the
quake caused many houses - including several million-dollar homes - to slide
off their foundations. Many buildings were seriously damaged, including two
hospitals, which have been closed. Other hospitals said they were 'inundated
with walking wounded'.
In the suburban town of Northridge, the epicentre of the quake north-west of
central Los Angeles, emergency workers struggled to free residents of a
three-storey apartment complex that partly collapsed. The multi-storey park
at the town's shopping centre collapsed and people were feared trapped
inside.
The earthquake struck at 4.31am Pacific Standard Time, according to the US
Geological Service. Had it struck two hours later, in the rush hour,
fatalities would probably have been much higher, officials said. Yesterday's
Martin Luther King holiday also meant that many businesses planned to stay
closed, reducing traffic.
Nonetheless the death toll was expected to increase through the day as
rescue workers searched collapsed buildings. Several raised freeways to the
north and west of the city collapsed. The Santa Monica freeway, the busiest
in the US, carrying more than 370,000 vehicles daily, was severely damaged
in several places.
Most of the main arteries to and through the San Fernando Valley, a suburban
expanse of about 3m residents, were badly damaged. Police said the quake
threw cars from elevated freeways on to streets below.
The stark pictures of the pancaked roadways in Los Angeles are reminiscent
of the 1989 San Francisco earthquake, which registered 7.1 on the Richter
scale, and in which more than 50 people died. Repairs and reinforcements to
the San Francisco freeway system are still in progress, four years later,
and are not expected to be completed for at least another two years. Los
Angeles, the US's second-biggest city, faces serious traffic problems for
years ahead, structural engineers predicted.
The city's airports, which were closed in the immediate aftermath of the
earthquake, reopened by mid morning and United Airlines announced that it
was resuming service to the city. However, delays were exacerbated by
numerous aftershocks, including two measuring over 5 on the Richter scale.
Telephone services to the entire Los Angeles area were limited to emergency
services. Officials called on residents to stay off the roads, warning of
severe danger. Most of Los Angeles was without electricity and there were
power cuts throughout California.
Mr Richard Riordan, the city's mayor, declared a local emergency an hour
after the earthquake, freeing local emergency services to respond without
regard for costs. President Bill Clinton and California governor Pete Wilson
also offered emergency support to the city.

FT  17 JAN 94 / Salinas seeks sweeping amnesty for guerrillas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Carlos Salinas of Mexico yesterday called for a special session of
Congress to give an amnesty to rebel guerrillas who seized several towns in
the southern state of Chiapas on New Year's Day.
The amnesty will be extended to all participants in the uprising, and will
cover their illegal acts between January 1 and yesterday.
The president said that there would now be no reason for rebels to remain
away from their villages; they could carry on with their lives peacefully.
Mr Salinas said he would soon propose an integrated plan for justice in
Chiapas.
The decision followed criticism at home and abroad of the government's
repression of the rebellion, and widespread sympathy for the plight of
indigenous people in the jungles of Chiapas.
A government official said the amnesty would create better conditions for
peaceful solution to the conflict, adding that Congress would be convened
today and that the necessary law would be passed as soon as possible.
On Thursday, Mr Salinas had announced a unilateral cease-fire in the
conflict. He then said he would pardon rebels who had acted out of
desperation or were pressed into the insurrection. The new amnesty, however,
will apply to all participants. It seems to be unconditional.
In a further sign of the government's more conciliatory approach to the
conflict in Chiapas, Mr Manuel Camacho Sols, government commissioner for
peace in the region, has accepted Bishop Samuel Ruiz of San Cristobal de Las
Casas as mediator with the guerrilla movement. At first, the government had
indirectly attacked followers of the radical bishop for sympathising with
the rebels.
Newspaper columists generally close to Mr Camacho, a former mayor of Mexico
City and foreign minister, yesterday sought to play down reports that he
would use his new position to challenge Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio, candidate
of Mexico's ruling party to succeed Mr Salinas as president via an election
this year.
Mr Camacho was Mr Colosio's rival for the party's nomination. The former
represents the newly ascendant conciliatory wing in the government.

Sheikh Ali Khalifa al-Sabah, former Kuwaiti finance minister, is among five
people due to stand trial tomorrow on charges of embezzling public funds,
the official Kuwait News Agency said yesterday, Reuter reports from Kuwait.
'The criminal court will look into the case of five persons, three of whom
are Kuwaitis, against whom the general prosecution had filed charges of
embezzling funds of the Kuwait Oil Tanker Company (KOTC),' the agency said.
The report was the first time Sheikh Ali, who is a member of the ruling
Sabah family, had been named by an official body in connection with the
case. The agency named the other four as Nasim Mohsen, a Jordanian, former
financial manager of KOTC, Hasan Qabazard, former deputy KOTC chairman for
financial affairs, Mr Tim Stafford, a Briton, and Abdulfatah al-Badr, the
company's former chairman.
Mr Qabazard has been in detention in Kuwait since January last year. Sheikh
Ali is currently in Kuwait. The other three defendants are abroad. Sheikh
Ali was oil and finance minister from 1983 to 1985, oil minister from 1985
to June 1990, and finance minister from June 1990 to April 1991.
A KOTC official has said the company's total losses from fraud may amount to
Dollars 200m. A judicial official has said the case alleged fraud involving
about Dollars 100m. KOTC is a subsidiary of state oil conglomerate Kuwait
Petroleum Corporation, which the oil minister chairs.

MONDAY
John Major at Scott inquiry
John Major, the hard-pressed UK prime minister (left), joins the growing
line of officials and government ministers required to give evidence in
public to Lord Justice Scott's arms-for-Iraq inquiry.
Mr Major set up the inquiry himself in November 1992 in response to the row
over alleged government complicity in the illegal arms sales. He was foreign
secretary and chancellor of the exchequer under Lady Thatcher.
The European Parliament holds its first full session of the year. The 518
deputies will be preparing nervously in Strasbourg for June's Euroelection,
likely to be dominated as much by domestic issues in the 12 member states as
by pan-European themes.
Textile squabble: The US is due to cut China's textile and clothing import
quotas by more than Dollars 1bn for alleged cheating. The Clinton
administration says China has tried to skirt limits by shipping goods into
the US through other nations.
Mercosur summit: The presidents of Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay,
the four countries which will make up the planned Mercosur free trade area,
are due to meet in Uruguay. Mercosur is planned to come into effect next
year, but some matters are undecided, for example, a common external tariff.
Lloyd's offer: Names on Gooda Walker and Feltrim syndicates - two of the
biggest loss makers at Lloyd's of London - meet this week to discuss the
Pounds 900m offer to settle litigation at the insurance market. Both groups
are likely to reject the deal, making their disputes dependent on legal
cases coming to court later this year. In these, Names are suing their
agents for alleged negligence.
Gooda Names, who meet today, have been offered Pounds 223m, compared with a
claim of Pounds 580m. Names have until February 14 to vote on the package.
Thorp licence: The licence for the Pounds 2.8bn Thorp nuclear reprocessing
plant at Sellafield, north-west England, comes into effect. The plant will
not be fully operational for another month, while preliminary tests
continue. In early February, the government faces a legal challenge on its
decision to grant the licence from Greenpeace, the environmental pressure
group, and Lancashire County Council who are worried about emissions.
Holidays: US federal government offices and banks will be closed for Martin
Luther King day.
TUESDAY
Patten consults in London
Chris Patten, the governor of Hong Kong, leaves for London for a series of
meetings with British ministers about the colony's political development. It
is expected that the governor will seek approval to push ahead with his
original democracy proposals in the form of a second bill to be put to Hong
Kong's legislature in March.
On Thursday, he will appear before the foreign affairs select committee of
the House of Commons. The committee is preparing a report on Anglo-
Chinese relations.
Lloyd Bentsen, the US treasury secretary, who is on a trip to Asia, arrives
in Thailand. He is expected to call for an opening of the Thai financial and
services sector to more foreign competition.
Burmese constitution: The country's national convention is due to sit. It
mostly comprises delegates hand-picked by the military junta and is charged
with drafting a new constitution. It may feel its hand has been strengthened
now the Karen, one of the regime's main opponents, have decided to hold
peace talks.
Bosnia negotiations resume: The leaders of Bosnia's three warring
communities will resume partition talks in Geneva under the international
mediators Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg.
Last week, Nato renewed warnings that the Serbs would risk air strikes if
they blocked the opening of the airport in Tuzla, the biggest Moslem
stronghold. Hope for a settlement is slim. Bosnian prime minister Haris
Silajdzic (above) has said that if the Serb shelling of Sarajevo does not
stop, his delegation will stay away.
Aluminium smeltdown: Trade representatives from the world's leading
aluminium-producing countries meet in Brussels with industry representatives
to consider ways of reducing global surpluses of the metal. This might lead
to co-ordinated cuts in production.
UK trade survey: The monthly distributive trade survey from the
Confederation of British Industry should give the first insight in retail
trade over Christmas and the New Year.
Media reports and anecdotal evidence point to a spending spree in late
December, although this may have been exaggerated by focusing on the
hitherto depressed south. Official figures on Wednesday will provide further
details of retail trading in December.
WEDNESDAY
Crunch-time for Hosokawa
In a decisive week for Japan's prime minister Morihiro Hosokawa, his ruling
coalition is trying to get parliament's upper house to vote on the four
political and electoral reform bills in a plenary session. This is the final
stage before they become law.
Procedural delays and splits in its own camp have forced the coalition to
aim for a vote in the upper house political reform committee mid-week,
paving the way for a plenary vote by Friday. Hosokawa is expected to succeed
in the end by a narrow margin. If he fails to get agreement by January 29,
the end of the extended parliamentary session, he may resign.
Bentsen in Beijing: US treasury secretary Lloyd Bentsen is due in the
Chinese capital. At a meeting of the US-China joint economic committee, he
is expected to discuss China's economic reforms, opening up its markets, and
US concerns about human rights. On Friday, he travels to Shanghai.
Allies in Ankara:
British foreign secretary Douglas Hurd visits the Turkish capital for talks
with Prime Minister Tansu Ciller (left). Tomorrow he is joined by his German
counterpart Klaus Kinkel. The Turks' European partners will try to reassure
them that the Greek accession to the presidency of the European Union will
not upset Turkey's plans to deepen its trade and political relations with
Brussels.
Theodoros Pangalos, Greece's deputy foreign minister, outlines to MEPs in
Strasbourg his government's priorities for the EU presidency during the next
six months.
Edouard Balladur, French prime minister, is expected to convene a strategy
session on the economy to try to find a way to reduce unemployment.
Ungagged: The Irish government's broadcasting ban on Sinn Fein, the
political wing of the Irish Republican Army terrorist organisation, is due
to lapse.
UK retail price index: Budget increases in tobacco, petrol and vehicle
excise duties are set to push up inflation. The headline rate for December
is expected to rise from November's 1.4 per cent year-on-year rate to about
2 per cent, which would be the highest level since December 1992.
Forecasters expect only a modest upturn in underlying inflation, which
excludes mortgage interest payments, to 2.7 per cent last month, from 2.5
per cent in November.

Bundesbank ponders rates
The Bundesbank council holds its regular fortnightly meeting. The German
central bank has not cut interest rates so far this year. Although money
supply growth may be abating, the recent weakness of the D-Mark has added to
uncertainty over the timing of German monetary easing.
The Bank of England will announce the terms of its first extended repo and
secured loan facilities to provide funds to the UK banking system to
February 10 and to February 24. The move is a step towards liberalising the
London money market.
South African elections: The African National Congress publishes its
official list of candidates for the April 27 elections, delayed from Tuesday
because of computer problems.
President FW de Klerk opens the National party election campaign with a trip
to Northwest Province.
Ukraine's parliament convenes:
Ukraine's parliament, the rada, reconvenes for its last session before
elections in March. Many of its members have already voiced their opposition
to the accord signed by President Leonid Kravchuk in Moscow last Friday
under which Ukraine is to eliminate its nuclear missiles over the next three
years.
This will be their first chance to attempt to derail the deal described by
President Boris Yeltsin of Russia as 'putting the last full stop in the last
chapter of the cold war'.
Vietnam's Communist party is scheduled to hold a special conference that has
been delayed from December. The party is expected to discuss the successes
and problems of economic reform (to Jan 24). There may be a leadership
reshuffle.
Inman takes charge:
Bobby Ray Inman is due to take over as US secretary of defense. Inman will
be the first former career officer to serve as secretary of defense since
General George Marshall, who held the office under President Harry Truman.
Inman also has the distinction of having voted for George Bush in the
election won by President Clinton.
FRIDAY
Belgian Guy to face music
Belgium's political establishment continues its painful self-examination
about allegations of bribery and corruption relating to the award of a
helicopter contract to Agusta, the Italian aircraft manufacturer.
Today, a special committee of the Belgian parliament is expected to question
Guy Coeme, deputy prime minister, and the most senior of three
French-speaking Socialist politicians. The magistrate investigating the
affair wants to examine them. All three have denied any wrongdoing and
opposed calls for their parliamentary immunity to be lifted.
Lloyd's meeting: Names belonging to Lloyd's of London loss-making Feltrim
syndicate meet to discuss the offer to settle litigation at the insurance
market. They have been offered Pounds 237m, just under 40 per cent of their
total claim.
Turkey's president Suleyman Demirel attends a summit of Turkic republics in
Baku, Azerbaijan (to Jan 22). Turkey hopes its cultural ties will help it
increase trade with and influence in central Asia.
WEEKEND
Venezuela congress meets
Venezuela's congress, elected last month, on Sunday begins its five-year
term. In a sharp break with the country's democratic history, the two
parties which have long dominated politics - Democratic Action (AD) and the
Social Christian Copei party - will be forced to share power with other
blocs. President-elect Rafael Caldera will thus be hard-pressed to put
together a majority.
ANC policy conference: The African National Congress, widely expected to
play a leading role in South Africa's government after April's election,
debates its future policy at an economic reconstruction conference.
Party in Weimar: Manfred Brunner, founds a German anti-Maastricht party in
Weimar on Sunday to contest this year's European election. Mr Brunner, an
outspoken opponent of the Maastricht treaty, took the government to the
constitutional court last year in a bid to have the treaty thrown out.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Monday: UK manufacturing output should show a modest rise between October
and November and grow 2 per cent compared with November 1992. Cold weather
should have given a boost to energy output. Economists expect no
acceleration in producer output prices despite Budget tax increases. Weak
oil prices should help keep input prices low.
Tuesday: An expected fall in Japan's private sector machinery orders in
November would increase pressure for action to boost the economy.
Wednesday: UK retailers had their best Christmas for years, fuelling
expectations of a 5.2 per cent year-on-year increase in volume sales last
month.
Canada's lead indicator for December should point to continued steady
growth, while November wage data should calm fears of inflation.
Thursday: Anything more than the anticipated 1.43m of US housing starts in
December would add to recent evidence of bumper fourth-quarter growth.
Friday: City expectations of a Pounds 2bn increase in UK bank and building
society lending in December would mark a strengthening of credit demand if
fulfilled.

FT  17 JAN 94 / Equity Markets This Week: Sterling and dollar to defend
gains
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The key question facing currency markets this week is whether the dollar and
sterling will be able to maintain the dramatic gains of recent days against
the D-Mark.
Rising optimism about the US and UK economies and mounting gloom about
Germany's recession pushed sterling three pfennigs, and the dollar two
pfennigs, higher.
The Anglo-Saxon economies seem set to remain the darlings of the markets but
some dealers fear this optimism might have been exaggerated, particularly if
this week's US and UK economic news is not as good as last week's.
On the D-Mark side, the main focus of attention is the meeting of the
Bundesbank council on Thursday. The Bundesbank's refusal to cut rates at its
last council meeting initially led the markets to assume rate cuts would
occur this time, but opinion has since become more mixed.
Germany's recession and improving inflation outlook have left some convinced
that there will be a cut. But, the dramatic weakening of the German currency
last week, and likely volatility in the German money markets as a result of
recent banking reforms left others believing cuts would be delayed.
The markets will be watching closely to see how far the Bundesbank is
willing to support the D-Mark. Although the Bundesbank's intervention to
support the D-Mark last week was only conducted through reserve management,
the bank is expected to oppose another dramatic D-Mark slide.
The apparent deadlock in the US-Japanese trade talks will leave the
yen-dollar rate particularly sensitive to political swings. Some dealers
hope Japan's government is moving closer towards introducing the fiscal
measures needed to boost the Japanese economy, however the underlying
fundamentals remain poor for the yen, and few expect it to stage any
significant rally.
Meanwhile, the Irish punt has benefited from sterling's recent bull run and
is at the top of the ERM grid. As Mr Chris Turner, of BZW points out, this
means the gap between the punt and peseta, currently the weakest ERM
currency, neared 10 per cent on several occasions last week.
With the punt likely to strengthen further, the trend underscores the
growing polarisation between the peripheral ERM currencies, in spite of
convergence in the centre.

FT  17 JAN 94 / Emerging Markets This Week: A growing trend towards Africa -
The Emerging Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Will 1994 be Africa's year, the year in which international investors
finally get the 'virgin' continent into their sights? Certainly there is a
growing body of opinion, both in Africa and beyond, that believes this will
be the case.
Indeed, it can be argued that this trend is already under way. On the
Johannesburg Stock Exchange foreigners were prominent throughout 1993,
initially in the gold and bond markets and later as buyers of industrial
stocks too.
Figures supplied by Barings Securities show that for the foreign investor,
who benefited from a 13.3 per cent strengthening in the financial rand, the
investment currency for overseas investors, the overall index rose by 63.4
per cent, the gold index by 184.1 per cent and the industrial index by 41
per cent.
They have also been evident in Botswana, while foreign buying on the
Zimbabwe Stock Exchange between late June and December was enough to cause
the Industrial index to more than double.
Mr Miles Morland of Blakeney Management, the London-based adviser to many of
the world's largest emerging market funds, is one who believes that the
continent's time has come. 'Looking at Africa is very much at the top of
their (emerging market funds) agenda. There is a terrific willingness to
believe in the African story.'
This can be traced to three important structural changes. Clearly the
catalytic event has been South Africa's rehabilitation as a respectable
investment destination. This has caused great excitement in the US and the
re-examination of the JSE has inevitably rebounded to the benefit of other
regional markets. Without the JSE, it would be doubtful how much attention
emerging market investors would devote to the other markets.
Since Mr Nelson Mandela, the ANC leader, called for an end to financial
sanctions against South Africa in September, there has been a veritable
stampede of US visitors to Johannesburg. Significant investment flows have
followed and the outlook for 1994 appears even more cheery.
Mr Morland reckons that the first half of 1994 will see at least five South
Africa or Southern Africa funds launched. Taken together with other African
funds and country funds, he believes there will be at least 10 funds
channelling money into South Africa next year.
The second important change concerns Africa itself. If the 1960s saw the
political winds of change blow through the continent, then the 1990s are
witnessing some equivalent economic changes as governments increasingly
embrace market economics after costly socialist experiments. The catalyst
for these changes has been the end of the cold war, meaning no more eastern
European bloc hand-outs, and the inexorable impoverishment of African
economies through deteriorating terms of trade and poor economic management.
Now, as Mr Morland comments, 'You either eat at the IMF's table, or you
don't eat at all.' This has led to a huge shift in economic orientation,
including a more favourable outlook towards equity markets. In 1983, for
example, Mr Bernard Chidzero, the Zimbabwe finance minister, was able to
extravagantly denounce the ZSE as 'the prostitute of the economy'.
Ten years later the same Mr Chidzero used his budget to introduce reforms
aimed at encouraging the development of the ZSE: foreign investors being
allowed to buy up to 25 per cent of companies listed on the ZSE; reductions
in capital gains tax on share market investment to 10 per cent from 30 per
cent and the withholding tax on dividends declared by quoted companies to 15
per cent from 20 per cent.
The final change concerns the burgeoning emerging market movement,
particularly in the US, with an increasing portion of assets earmarked for
emerging markets and offshore investment.
A November survey by the US firm Kleiman International Consultants found
that international institutional investment in emerging markets had risen by
3 per cent to 13 per cent of international funds in 1993, with allocation
over the past five years rising more than five-fold.
Even within this trend, Africa has a lot of catching up to do. A recent
survey by Micropal of global emerging market funds found that the 54 largest
of these funds had invested only about Dollars 40m out of Dollars 11.5bn
(0.35 per cent).
Clearly, if Africa in general and South Africa in particular becomes a focus
for emerging market funds, then this in itself will be good reason to be
invested there.
To this rosy scenario, however, some cautionary caveats about Africa must be
entered. Firstly, even by emerging market standards, Africa is an unusual
beast. On the one hand, the JSE with a market capitalisation of about
Dollars 105bn is much larger than the Dollars 20-Dollars 60bn average for
emerging markets. On the other hand, most of the other African markets -
Botswana, Ghana, Kenya, Namibia, Nigeria and Zimbabwe (with Zambia, Malawi,
Uganda and Tanzania all on the point of opening) - are minuscule.
A recent survey by Mr Michel ZhuParris of Morgan Stanley Asset Management
found that between them Africa's newly emerging markets had only 12 liquid
stocks with market capitalisations greater than Dollars 100m (with seven of
these trading in Morocco).
Second, although Africa is fairly cheap compared with many world markets, it
has been cheap for a long time and for good reason. A major factor here is
that investors are, with the exception of the Botswana pula, investing in
very weak, devaluing currencies.
Another problem is that the markets are shallow, illiquid and small. Also,
in some cases, not the JSE, there is a dearth of domestic investors to
piggyback on which can cause liquidity problems.
Mr Mark Tunmer, chairman of the ZSE, comments: 'Our big problem is that
we've got all the demand but nothing to sell.' He reckons that if the ZSE
had been able to satisfy demand, foreign flows would have been four to five
times larger. This problem has also affected the JSE, where buyers have had
to get used to the idea that fulfilling a big order can take more than a
week.
These liquidity problems should, however, ease over time. If markets do
enjoy a bull run this will stimulate new issues and rights issues, thereby
increasing the amount of stock in circulation.
A further factor to consider is that African markets are much more dependent
on commodity prices and politicians than many other emerging markets.
Investors not fully aware of developments could well burn their fingers.
On the commodity front, developments are good. Important commodities like
gold, cocoa and coffee have broken out of long bear cycles. The politicians
may be behaving better, but in some cases the depth of commitment to
financial discipline and good government remains to be tested.
In the final analysis, what happens in South Africa will probably determine
the extent to which other regional markets flourish.

FT  17 JAN 94 / Equity Markets: Metallgesellschaft deepens suspicions over
derivatives - Risk and reward
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
That German industrial giant Metallgesellschaft has been brought to its
knees by a one-off derivatives hedging strategy gone awry has deepened the
suspicions of financial regulators and other sceptics that these relatively
new and complex instruments are systemically dangerous.
The company says derivatives losses from its US oil and gas subsidiary, MG
Corp, could mount to DM2.3bn. While its creditors arrange how best to mop up
the mess, the derivatives industry is trying to put the best face on the
situation, saying the MG example is not the norm.
First off, they say, MG's hedging strategy was not a complicated structured
instrument that ran wild because it failed to be understood by top-level
managers. Instead it appears the company ignored its risk models and carried
such huge positions that they became unmanageable. It also, and more
understandably, seems to have mismatched the terms of its hedges with its
contractual obligations.
MG Corp sold oil and petrol under long-term contracts (known as 'forwards')
to end-users and third-party traders. Then, in the simplest of hedges, they
offset the forward contracts with corresponding purchases in both the Nymex
oil futures markets and in over-the-counter oil swaps.
Though MG's forward obligations were five to 10 years out, it offset them
with short-term (three-month) derivatives. There was a good reason for this.
Liquidity, or the ability to enter and exit trades at a reasonable price,
exists only in the shortest-term deliveries in Nymex futures contracts. OTC
oil swaps are less liquid than the futures markets and become thinner at
longer maturities. Thus, it made business sense for MG to keep the hedge
positions liquid, or short.
The other attraction of short-term hedges was that, at least initially, they
generated profit: so long as short-term oil futures prices were above those
for longer-term delivery (backwardation), MG's practice of buying contracts
for three-month delivery and 'rolling' them into the next three-month
maturity yielded streams of cash.
Seasoned energy traders say MG's risk model should have warned that if the
oil market inverted, and short-term prices fell below those for distant
deliveries (a contango market), the results would be disastrous, and
management should have made contingency plans to restructure the hedges.
Instead, MG's massive short hedge rolling programme remained in place as the
oil markets went contango last autumn, generating rollover losses estimated
at Dollars 30m a month.
Energy traders believe the sheer size of MG's positions prevented it from
restructuring its hedges. 'The biggest problem of all here is the size,' one
trader said. Some estimates put MG's oil near 200m barrels, with exchange
trades close to 10 per cent of Nymex open positions.
Typically, hedgers who are in loss-making positions in the futures markets
switch to less painful positions in the OTC markets, moving discreetly to
shake off traders waiting to capitalise on their dilemma. MG's huge
positions made this impossible. Despite widespread publicity, MG is still
expected to perform another unprofitable 'roll' at the Nymex this month.
Mr Gary Gastineau, director of customer risk management at Swiss Bank, says
MG would have done better with a single large long-term hedge in the oil
swaps market.
However, that structured transaction would have been expensive, illiquid,
and would not have had the profitable lure of the short-term futures roll.

<TEXT>
Latin America
Latin American borrowers issued a record Dollars 25bn (Pounds 16.8bn) in new
debt last year in international markets, as new issue volume in the fourth
quarter reached Dollars 10.4bn, Salomon Brothers has said. This compared
with Dollars 11.5bn in 1992.
Average maturity lengthened to 4.8 years from 3.7 years in 1992, with
Mexican issues carrying an average 5.91 years. The private sector accounted
for 64 per cent of new issues. Mexico accounted for 36 per cent, and Brazil
and Argentina for 25 per cent each.
Israel
The country has agreed in principle to a second stock market, according to
reports last week. The finance ministry is to prepare a list of regulations
to govern an additional exchange by mid-April.
Nepal
The country's first stock exchange swung into action last Thursday with
transactions totalling some Dollars 1,550.
The bourse operates on the outcry system and currently trades for three
hours from Sunday to Thursday and one hour on Friday.
There are 62 companies listed on the stock exchange and the authorities aim
to establish two indices in the near future.
Warsaw
The equity market was very active last week and the trend is likely to
continue, traders say.
The WIG index gained some 7 per cent during the week, as turnover reached a
record Dollars 125m.
Mexico
Foreign investment in government instruments totalled 67.95bn new pesos in
1993, an increase of 53.1 per cent from a year-earlier, according to central
bank data.
The majority of the holdings were concentrated in Treasury bills, accounting
for some 47.7bn new pesos.

FRANKFURT
Speculation on the outlook for interest rates is on the agenda this week
ahead of Thursday's Bundesbank Council meeting. NatWest Securities says
recent data on orders and industrial output point to further economic
weakness, providing some justification for monetary easing. But the
weakening D-Mark, down 4.2 per cent on a trade weighted basis since
mid-October, mitigates against swift cuts.
ZURICH
Winterthur, Switzerland's third largest insurer, has called a news
conference this morning at which it is expected to announce that it is
taking a substantial minority stake in DBV Holding, Commerzbank's insurance
subsidiary. Commerzbank, also holding a press conference today, has been
looking for a partner for DBV after talks with Zurich Insurance broke down
last year.
STOCKHOLM
Volvo holds its EGM on Wednesday to ratify the appointment of a new board of
directors, which will open the way for asset disposals. These are rumoured
to include the sale of its 46.9 per cent stake in Cardo. Volvo shares hit
all-time highs on Friday, following positive reports from analysts and
recent press comment. The market has also become enthusiastic following
suggestions that France may soon end the relationship between the Swedish
group and Renault.
MADRID
Banco Santander is due to continue Spain's bank reporting season this week
and analysts are looking for a 6 per cent rise in 1993 net profit, after
Popular's 7 per cent rise, announced last week. UBS says the possibility of
a general banking crisis in Spain has diminished after last week's comments
from Banesto's former chairman, Mr Mario Conde, when he maintained Banesto's
financial troubles were overstated.
TOKYO
Further buying from overseas investors may emerge, especially if other Asian
markets resume their decline. Although uncertainty over the political reform
bill, which the government hopes to pass through parliament on Thursday, may
cause some volatility, the market could receive a boost once the bill is
approved. However, share prices could see heavy selling pressure if Prime
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa fails to push the bill through.

FT  17 JAN 94 / Equity Markets: No change in fundamental sentiment - London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Few equity strategists at the leading UK securities firms appear to be
seriously upset by the sudden panic over base rate prospects which has upset
the stock market. And, since US influences also shared the blame for the
sharp fall in the Footsie at the beginning of the week, it should be said
that the US houses in London are still among the optimists when it comes to
UK interest rates and inflation.
Lehman Brothers sees not one but two further cuts in base rates before the
end of June, while Goldman Sachs predicts base rates at 4 1/2 per cent in
mid-year.
It would not be difficult to round up similar forecasts from strategists at
UK broking and investment houses; BZW, raising its year-end Footsie forecast
to 3,900, says 'the interest rate environment is better than expected'. So
perhaps some investors have been mistaking a bout of profit-taking for a
fundamental change of sentiment.
Most European stock markets, and certainly London, became overheated before
Christmas, and some form of correction was seen as inevitable. But chartists
of UK equities applauded when the FT-SE Index bounced from the 3,350 support
area on Thursday and by the end of the week it seemed clear that the rest of
the market agreed with them.
There are other reasons for believing that the stock market may yet show the
6 per cent gain traditionally recorded in January - this is around four
times the average monthly gain for the rest of the year. Company results may
at long last be showing the signs of benefit from economic recovery for
which the market has been searching.
The banking sector was impressed by results from TSB, which provided a sound
platform for the trading figures due later this month from the rest of the
sector.
The leisure sector, which is central to hopes for a strengthening in UK
consumer spending, is looking ahead more positively after Rank Organisation
drew attention to the implications of the rise in holiday bookings.
While analysts have tended to keep ratings on Rank itself fairly restrained,
in view of the range of its activities, the holiday bookings lesson has not
been lost elsewhere. British Airways is favoured as an obvious beneficiary
from the expected jump in holiday traffic which began to show itself at
Christmas time.
Cyclical stocks, including leisures and hotels, have significantly
outperformed over the past year but Goldman Sachs is among those to believe
that leisures are still sufficiently undervalued to warrant further
investment.
Perceptions that current valuations on UK equities are generous has brought
some repositioning by the institutions but their actions appear positive
rather than negative.
The more optimistic analysts argue that, while equities may appear
overvalued in terms of prospective price/earnings ratios of more than 15 for
this year, they should be seen as undervalued in terms of gilt yields or
short-term interest rates.

FT  17 JAN 94 / Equity Markets: Investors set aside concerns - New York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After last week's record-breaking gains, US share prices are likely to rise
further this week as stock market investors continue to set aside concerns
about high equity valuations and rising interest rates and concentrate on
the promising economic and earnings outlook.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average is now well past 3,800, in spite of
warnings from some analysts that there would be a lot of profit-taking when
the average hit that record mark. That there was not much profit-taking -
just a 20-point sell-off mid-week, which was quickly offset by a strong
Friday rally - was primarily due to the consistently positive economic news
that has been released recently.
That data has included a big rise in industrial output, sharply higher
retail sales, and low consumer and producer price inflation. Investors have
responded to the figures by investing in a range of stocks, but most notably
in companies whose earnings are closely tied to the economic cycle. This
explains why the Dow has outperformed other indices lately.
Investors, however, have also been looking forward to some more solid
improvements in corporate profitability. They should get what they want this
week, when the fourth quarter reporting season begins in earnest.
Tomorrow will be the big day for the banking sector - a veritable 'Super
Tuesday' of quarterly reporting. Citicorp, which last week issued a
preliminary forecast of its October-to-December earnings that delighted
investors, Chase Manhattan, Chemical Banking, and NationsBank are among the
big banks unveiling their figures.
In the wake of Citicorp's upbeat prediction, and the recent strong numbers
from J. P. Morgan, analysts are expecting a healthy round of results. Given
that the sector has already rallied in anticipation of this, however, banks'
earnings announcements might not prompt that much movement in sector share
prices.
Also reporting on Tuesday will be Chrysler, and here too analysts are
looking forward to some positive data. Yet, as with the banks, investors
have already discounted a good fourth quarter, so there may not be much of a
reaction from Chrysler's stock. At times like these, companies can only
disappoint the market, barring an extraordinary and unforeseen leap in
profits.
The big oil companies will also begin reporting earnings this week, starting
with Mobil and Texaco. Although oil prices have been falling steadily for
months, Wall Street is looking for some solid profits growth due in
particular to buoyant earnings from companies' international 'downstream',
or refining and distribution, operations.
There is not much in the way of economic data due out this week, although
Wednesday's trade figures should say something about how US exports have
been affected by the recent appreciation in the dollar. The only other
statistics of note will be December housing starts, which are due to be
released on Thursday.

<TEXT>
As Bundesbank president Mr Hans Tietmeyer said on Friday last week, German
interest rates will not stay at current levels 'for longer than necessary'.
How long that will be remains open, but the remarks rekindled speculation
that the German central bank will deliver its long-awaited rate cut on
Thursday, when the policy-making council holds its second meeting of the
year.
Ahead of the meeting, investors' attention will be focused on currency
developments. The D-Mark's weakness against the US dollar helped drive bund
prices down sharply on Friday and investors will treat any signs of a
strengthening US economy - implying the need for higher rates in the US - as
bad news for bunds.
It may be that currency considerations will restrict Mr Tietmeyer's freedom
to ease the Lombard and discount rates from 6.75 and 5.75 per cent
respectively, even if preliminary January inflation data (due towards the
end of week) suggest a cut is justified on domestic grounds.
Even if the D-Mark remains stable against the US dollar, economists said the
Bundesbank would be unlikely to deliver more than a 0.25 per cent cut in the
discount rate. There was scope for bund yields to drop from current levels
in the first half of the year but the fall was not likely to be dramatic,
they said.

FT  17 JAN 94 / World Bond Markets: Blow to Turkey's borrowing plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Turkey's plans to tap the international bond market were dealt a blow last
week when Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's, the two leading credit rating
agencies, downgraded the country's debt rating.
Moody's cut Turkey's foreign debt rating to Ba1 from Baa3, which reduces it
from investment to sub-investment grade. Because of the borrowing rules
affecting some US institutions, Turkey may find it more difficult to sell
its paper in the Yankee bond market, the US market for foreign issuers. It
could also impair Turkey's ability to raise debt finance in Europe and
Japan.
Meanwhile, Standard &amp; Poor's lowered Turkey's debt rating from BBB to BBB -
, which keeps it just within the limit of investment grade ratings.
According to treasury figures, Turkey's external debt, both public and
private, stood at Dollars 59bn at the end of September, against Dollars 51bn
at the start of 1993. However, with a spate of new issues before the year
end, bankers estimate the figure is closer to Dollars 62bn.
Over the past two years, Ankara has looked increasingly to foreign debt to
finance the current account and budget, at a time of high domestic interest
rates. Shifting its borrowing from syndicated loans to bonds, it has been
able to diversify its investor base and improve the maturity profile of its
debt. Like other low-rated borrowers, Turkey offers attractive high-yielding
paper.
However, Moody's decision reflects continuing concern over Turkey's large
current account deficit and deteriorating budget picture. Although Moody's
notes improvements on tax reform, and state asset sales, the agency
forecasts further spending pressures and expects political concerns to force
the government to go slow on further reform. The S&amp;P downgrade also
reflected 'a lack of progress in combatting the fiscal deficit in 1993 and
the absence of a credible programme to reduce the deficit in the medium
term'.
For 1994, the Turkish treasury has announced a more conservative borrowing
target, with plans to float around Dollars 1.3bn of bonds to cover its
external financing needs.
In 1993, Turkey tapped Japanese, German and UK bond markets for close to
Dollars 4bn. In addition, Dollars 3.8bn of project financing has been
extended to Turkish public sector enterprises and local municipalities.
Turkey issued a sterling bond for the first time in 1993 and this year is
looking at possible issues in both the French and Spanish bond markets.
The 1994 budget envisages Dollars 2bn in foreign debt interest repayments.
The current account deficit is expected to come back slightly to Dollars
4.4bn, according to Treasury estimates, compared with a provisional estimate
of Dollars 5bn in 1993.

Concerns of oversupply caused by last Friday's announcement that the finance
ministry would be selling government bonds outright for the first time in 11
years, are expected to continue this week.
The yield on the No 157 10-year benchmark, which closed up 11 basis points
at the week's high of 3.165 per cent on Friday, may rise further as
investors take profits on their positions.
The government, which usually sells bonds with repurchase agreements,
expects to sell about Y900bn to fund the forthcoming economic support
package. The MoF sold Y800bn worth of bonds without repurchase agreements in
1978, Y300bn in 1981, Y1,500bn in 1982 and Y900bn in 1983. The outright
sales via the Bank of Japan could start this week.
Meanwhile, hopes of a discount rate cut have receded due to the recent
strength on the stock market. The Nikkei index gained 4.7 per cent last week
on active buying by foreign investors, and analysts expect fund flows into
Tokyo could last if Asian stock markets continue to slide.
Investors are expected to focus on political developments this week. Prime
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa wants to push the political reform bill through
on Wednesday. A delay in the upper house could further postpone the economic
stimulus package, due to be announced Thursday.

The gilts market will probably concentrate on this week's economic
statistics for evidence about inflation, now expectations of an imminent
base rate cut appear to have receded. Mr Peter Fellner, gilts strategist of
NatWest Markets, said the figures would be looked at for any signs which
might dent 'the consensus expectation of non-inflationary growth'.
The December retail prices index along with retail sales figures are due out
on Wednesday. Traders expect retail sales growth to be strong, in the wake
of recent M0 figures, and the fact that December 1992's poor figure will
drop out of the index.
Analysts say the headline inflation figure will pick up from November's 1.4
per cent, probably to an annual rate of 2 per cent, as mortgage rate cuts in
December 1992 drop out and Budget increases in petrol duties kick in. The
underlying rate, which excludes mortgage payments, may rise to an annual 2.7
per cent.
The Bank will reveal more details on Tuesday of its auction of 2008-12
stock, scheduled for January 26. The market expects the issue to raise
Pounds 3bn, have a maturity of 2010, and yield 6.5 per cent. Traders were
relieved that the auction was not for longer-dated stock, as that would have
suggested the Bank felt long gilt yields had reached bottom.

Prices of Treasury notes and bonds suffered a series of blows at the end of
last week as the market took fright at a second straight day of strong
economic news.
Thursday had already seen the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond shed almost a
point in response to stronger than expected growth in consumer spending.
Then on Friday, it lost nearly half a point more when the Federal Reserve
reported that industrial production had jumped by 0.7 per cent in December
compared with expectations of a figure nearer 0.4 per cent.
After that, the coming week should look relatively tame. For a start, the
market is closed today for Martin Luther King Memorial Day - and the rest of
the week is likely to mark a hiatus after last week's activity as investors
regroup in readiness for the release of the key data for January employment,
due out on February 4.
That said, the market will not be left without some data to chew over. The
figures for November's trade deficit are expected to show a slight shrinkage
from October's Dollars 10.5bn on Wednesday.
On Thursday, December housing starts should show a slight fall from
November's 1.43m and new filings for unemployment claims are expected to
have stood at 325,000 in the week ended January 15.

FT  17 JAN 94 / World Bond Markets: Dollar FRNs back in the limelight -
Capital &amp; Credit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar floating-rate note (FRN) sector staged a dramatic come-back last
week and is set to grow further in coming months, driven by growing investor
demand.
Investors' recent appetite for US dollar FRNs largely reflects fears that,
as the US economy continues to recover, the US Federal Reserve will tighten
monetary policy to forestall a resurgence in inflation.
'Investors are beginning to feel the next move in US interest rates will be
up, which means there's a special attraction in holding floating-rate
instruments,' said a London syndicate official.
'We have seen a major reallocation of funds from fixed-rate into
floating-rate paper,' added another.
Last week's highlight in the FRN sector was Canada's Dollars 2bn five-year
issue, paying a coupon of three-month Libor minus 25 basis points. Although
the deal was considered to be aggressively priced, it met with solid demand.
Total FRN issuance last week amounted to some Dollars 2.9bn.
'After last week, it's fair to say the FRN market is back,' said a senior
London banker.
The FRN market slumped in 1986 after the perpetual floating-rate note sector
crashed; in the aftermath of the sell-off, issuance dried to a trickle and
the market became illiquid.
Only in the last two years has it managed to get back on its feet and enjoy
growing popularity among investors.
Analysts at Kidder Peabody cite several reasons for the market's recovery.
For one, innovative structures, such as so-called collared floating-rate
notes (where the coupon range is limited by a floor rate and a ceiling rate)
have enabled issuers to achieve sub-Libor funding through floating-rate
products.
Furthermore, volatility in European currency markets, amid uncertainty over
European Monetary Union, increased the attraction of US dollar floating rate
securities as a safe haven investment, the analysts note.
Lastly, they point out that tight swap spreads have offered limited
arbitrage opportunities, making it more difficult for borrowers to issue
fixed-rate and swap into sub-Libor funds.
Most syndicate managers expect to see substantial FRN issuance in coming
weeks, partly because floating-rate debt currently can offer comparatively
cheap funding.
'The market has got to the stage where it has become more cost-competitive
and efficient for raising large size,' says an FRN trader, adding, 'at the
moment it tends to be cheaper to borrow floating-rate funds.'
Moreover, floating-rate debt offers borrowers maximum flexibility as they
can include a call option which the borrower can exercise if its funding
needs change. Canada, for example, included a call option after the first
year.
With the US furthest ahead in the global interest-rate cycle, the dollar
sector is expected to dominate FRN issuance in coming months. But once rates
are seen to have bottomed in Europe and Japan, issuance is also expected to
pick up in sterling, D-Marks and yen.
Meanwhile, in the sterling sector, some Pounds 1.7bn in FRNs, issued mostly
by building societies, will be redeemed this year. Building societies, which
like to match their variable-rate liabilities and assets, are natural FRN
borrowers. A further Pounds 2.9bn of FRNs include call options in 1994 and
as most of them involve 5 per cent coupon floors, observers say it is likely
a substantial amount will be called if UK interest rates are cut again.
'If base rates are cut to 5 per cent, Libor will probably fall below that
level, making an FRN with a 5 per cent coupon rather expensive funding,'
said a syndicate manager. 'The market may see quite a lot of paper being
withdrawn, some of which could get refinanced,' especially if building
societies see an upturn in mortgage demand, he said.

FT  17 JAN 94 / The Markets: Unstable foundations of the Chinese economic
miracle - Economic Eye
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Arriving in today's China is a shocking experience. Even the most
experienced Sino-travellers marvel at the pace of economic development in
Chinese cities and the enthusiasm with which urban dwellers are embracing
the trappings of capitalist societies.
For Lloyd Bentsen, the US treasury secretary who lands in Beijing on
Wednesday, having spent last week in Moscow, the signs of economic dynamism
will look even more sparkling. A week in Moscow is enough to convince anyone
that there are no easy solutions to Russia's economic difficulties. China,
by contrast, is in the seemingly enviable position of having too much growth
rather than too little.
After fifteen years of market-orientated reform in which economic growth has
averaged nearly 10 per cent a year, the assumption built into most scenarios
of the coming decade is that China's economic miracle will continue.
Certainly the large number of foreign companies who have poured into China
over the past three years believe so. So does the World Bank. Last year's
report on the economic prospects for developing countries estimated that, by
the beginning of the next decade, China's economy (properly measured) would
be larger than that of the US.
However will the past turn out to be as reliable a guide to the future as
many investors seem to hope? Perhaps. But it is also possible to construct a
scenario in which China's economic success story goes decidely sour. Like
Russia, China suffers from a number of post-planning hangovers - inequality
and under-employment, growing regional tensions and a decline in central
authority - which could yet undermine its prospects for the decade ahead.
It is easy for the foreign visitor to be fooled by a city-hopping trip to
China. Travelling by train rather than aeroplane quickly reveals that the
vast mass of rural China remains poor and undeveloped. The percentage of the
population which now lives in poverty has fallen from 33 per cent in 1970 to
9 per cent in 1990. But 100m Chinese are still living in absolute poverty,
many of whom are under-employed farmers. The Chinese government estimates
that 130m of the total 333m agricultural labour force is surplus to
requirements, a figure which could reach 200m by the end of the decade.
The income gap between urban and rural populations, after narrowing in the
early 1980s, is growing again, as the upper chart shows. But it is regional
differences in growth and poverty which hint at the underlying threat to
China's economic future. Poverty rates are much higher in the northern and
western regions, far from the coastal growth centres. In these regions,
rural manufacturing enterprises employ a much smaller percentage of the
rural workforce.
The market economy ought to provide an easy mechanism for easing the
political tensions that regional inequalities on this scale can throw up by
mass migration of rural workers to urban areas in the richer provinces. But
in China, legal inter-provincial migration is strictly controlled in order
to maintain 'social stability'. This, translated, means that the central
government and affluent provincial governments want to stop what they
consider would be a socially explosive flood of poorer workers into cities.
But sporadic rural riots and the large groups of illegal rural migrants in
China's main cities suggest this attempt to bottle-up the problem is not
succeeding.
Alternatively, the central government could use the tax system to spread the
fruits of growth more widely. But in China, as in Russia and other former
communist states, total tax revenue has dropped sharply in the past decade.
Within this declining total, the share of revenue which the central
government retains has fallen from 60 per cent in the early 1980s to 45 per
cent by the end of the decade as the richer and progressively more powerful
provinces have become increasingly unwilling to transfer revenue to the
centre. The central government's new value-added tax is supposed to solve
this problem. It will only succeed if increasingly unco-operative, or
corrupt, provincial officials are willing to collect and pass on the
revenues.
As the power of the centre has weakened, so its ability to manage the
economy has also dwindled. The fall in tax revenue has undermined the power
of fiscal policy as a macroeconomic policy weapon for the central
government. Provincial governments have also extended their influence over
the local branches of the central bank, thereby undermining central monetary
control. The result has been progressively violent boom-bust cycles of rapid
growth followed by accelerating inflation.
Meanwhile, as total tax revenues have fallen, so monetary policy has become
the main means of financing subsidies to loss-making state enterprises.
According to estimates by Professor Jeffrey Sachs of Harvard University,
these consume 10 per cent of GNP. So far they have not been inflationary
largely because of the willingness of the Chinese public to build-up
substantial savings in money deposits. But the rapid growth of street-side
sellers of shares suggest that the public's toleration for money savings may
be dwindling.
In short, the risk of a destabilising acceleration in inflation is growing.
But the central government faces a paradox. The success of further
decentralised economic development is increasingly dependent on a
substantial re-centralisation of economic power to control inflation and
share the fruits of growth. That industrial output and inflation are both
still accelerating, despite the central government's campaign to slow the
economy last year, suggests that its softly softly approach to
re-establishing central economic control is not working. A return to more
repressive central government, and a stalling of reform and economic growth,
may yet be the only way to force the richer provinces to recognise that this
re-centralisation must occur. Continued rapid growth in China is far from
assured.

FT  17 JAN 94 / The Markets: All together now for 1995 - Global Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Will 1995 be the first strong year of global growth since the 1980s?
Investment analysts who have written off the prospects for 1994 -
continental Europe still stagnant, Japan still deflating, US and UK
throttled back by tax rises - are starting to console themselves with the
thought of the year after. 'Most of us have forgotten what synchronous
global growth is like,' writes Maureen Allyn of Scudder, the US fund
managers.
Amnesia is particularly common on the subject of commodity prices, partly
because, as the chart shows, the uptick of developed country growth in early
1992 was accompanied by largely stable prices for industrial raw materials.
However, just because commodity prices fell consistently between the summer
of 1988 and the autumn of 1993 is no guarantee that they will stay down.
Indeed, the pickup in raw materials prices in the fourth quarter of 1993 is
one of the more unremarked developments of recent months.
Commodity prices are only one of the elements in global inflation, of
course, and the rupture of the wage/price spiral in many countries means
that even if there is a sharp rise in the cost of raw materials, it need not
feed so rapidly into the general price level.
One other comfort is often cited, the downward pressure on prices stemming
from the shift of manufacturing output to the Pacific Rim. This is 'just
plain wrong', argues Albert Edwards of Kleinwort Benson in London. In
low-wage economies raw materials account for a far higher proportion of
costs than in mature, high-wage economies. 'Thus if commodity prices start
rising,' he says, 'low-wage producers will be forced to pass on these
increases far more quickly.'
A strong year worldwide in 1995 might pose some inflationary risks. For big
international companies, however, it would be the first year since 1989 when
results were not damaged by recession somewhere in the developed world. If
that thought becomes widespread, it would do something to justify the level
at which stock markets are selling.
Germanic
The Germanisation of the UK money markets comes a step closer on Thursday
when the Bank of England announces the terms of its first extended repo
facility, allowing the Bank to supply funds to the money market on a more
settled, longer-term basis than its current day-to-day activities. It will
make its operating practices look a little more like those of the
Bundesbank.
Whether the Bank starts to innovate more rapidly will partly depend on how
seriously it takes the recommendations of papers for the City Research
Project written by Norbert Schnadt of the Financial Markets Group at the
London School of Economics.
Mr Schnadt argues that London's attractiveness as a financial centre is
hampered by the volatility of short-term interest rates, which in turn stems
from the Bank's traditional operating practices. These are influenced by the
Bank's historic rivalry with the clearing banks. It is more than a century
since the Bank stopped lending in competition with the clearers, but it is
still left with the folk memory of the preceding 200 years.
Nonetheless, in its tercentenary year, there are signs that the Bank is
throwing off this legacy of the past. The new repo system is the logical
extension of the post-1987 changes to the money market which deprived the
discount houses of their unique access to the central bank and brought it,
at last, into direct bilateral dealings with the clearers.
Now, the Bank is undergoing a period of intense introspection as it redraws
its internal organisation to support its three core aims: monetary
stability, systemic stability, and the attractiveness of the UK as a
financial centre. Its response to Mr Schnadt's recommendations for a further
extension of the repo system will indicate just how much weight it places on
the third of its priorities.
Re-integration
The death of vertical integration, discussed in this space last week, has
started to generate its own contrarian antithesis. Boston Consulting Group
has just published a note proclaiming a rebirth of vertical integration, not
in the wholly-owned form of the past, but as a partnership linking the
entire supply chain into an integrated customer-focused system.
'One such group,' says BCG, 'is Du Pont (fibres), Spring Mills (fabric),
Warren Featherstone (children's apparel) and Mercantile stores.
'They first got together to defend themselves against imported clothing and
began by sharing point of sale information. Later they started to co-operate
in planning product-line introductions. The result has been spectacular.
Markdowns are a third of the industry average, gross profit margins rose
throughout the past recession, and share of market has increased.'
From an investment point of view, the new co-operators are as attractive as
the companies profiting from dis-integrating. Just harder to spot.
Bloodletting
The first anniversary is upon us of a remarkable week of corporate
bloodletting in the US. A few days in late January 1993 saw John Akers
resign at IBM, Paul Lego leave at Westinghouse, and James Robinson take the
first step towards the door at American Express.
The US results season, just getting under way, will give investors their
first considered opportunity to pass judgment on the performance of the
departing bosses' successors. In advance of this opportunity, reaction has
been mixed. Westinghouse, for example, has consistently underperformed the
US market since the change of management. American Express initially
outperformed but has drifted downwards in relative terms since last autumn.
IBM, the most spectacular case of a company in trouble, initially did
comparatively poorly but has outperformed since December. Nonetheless, a
year after IBM cut its dividend its shares are selling for less than they
did two decades ago.
Analysts are starting to say it is time to re-assess IBM's prospects. Good
results could turn favourable opinions into some solid buying. There are
still just as many pros as there are cons, however.
On the plus side is Louis Gerstner's decision, a few months after taking
over as chairman, to undo the radical decentralisation planned by John
Akers. IBM is a global, full-line computer company or it is nothing.
Splitting the company up as Akers planned would have destroyed this precious
asset. Other pluses include the much tighter focus on costs, the move
towards a new unifying technology (the chips designed for the PowerPC, which
may eventually unite all IBM's range), and the determination to exploit
IBM's greatest single advantage, the installed base of existing computers,
by listening more closely to customers' complaints.
Against that there is the vulnerability of the mainframe business, on which
IBM's profitability still depends; the history of slow development, with
promising innovations delayed by internal competition and the worldwide
duplication of bureaucracies and facilities.
Tackling this last weakness will mean, in 1994, the sort of cuts in Europe
which have already affected IBM's US operations, which will weaken IBM's
hold on its European customers and its ability to present itself as the
model corporate citizen.
Conclusion: IBM's long-term prosperity is not assured, but in the short run
investors may take the opportunity of any favourable earnings news to
re-assess the company's shares. Slightly further out, much hangs on Europe,
where the computer-downsizing trend is not yet as well-established as in the
US. As Europe starts to recover from recession, IBM will be hoping for a few
more lucrative mainframe years there. That might be the breathing space Mr
Gerstner needs.

FT  17 JAN 94 / International Company News: Olivetti seeking L2,000bn to
expand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM

<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Olivetti, the Italian computer group, is seeking shareholder approval to
raise up to L2,000bn (Dollars 1.17bn) in fresh funds to bolster growth and
investment, especially in telecommunications and multi-media ventures.
The decision to raise extra money was taken on Friday at a board meeting
presided over by Mr Carlo De Benedetti, the chairman. In June, Olivetti
raised L902bn but this was primarily intended to alleviate the group's
losses, which for 1993 are expected to be in the order of L400bn - 450bn.
By contrast, officials said the fresh call was to take advantage of
investment opportunities in the fast evolving telecoms and multi-media
sectors. The decision was announced just as preliminary bids closed for the
contract to operate Italy's new Europe-wide standard GSM mobile phone
network.
Olivetti is heading one of the three consortia considered most likely to win
the contract. The consortium, Omnitel, in which Olivetti has a 51 per cent
stake and includes Bell Atlantic and Swedish Telecom, recently increased its
capital to L200bn. But industry analysts believe this would have to be
increased further if Omnitel were to win the contract.
The Ivrea-based computers group has also given a foretaste of its 1993
performance, saying group sales rose 7.3 per cent to L8,610bn, back to the
level of 1990.

FT  17 JAN 94 / International Company News: Amtrak admits losing Dollars 33
on every ticket
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Amtrak, the heavily loss-making operator of US passenger train services,
ended a dismal year with the yawning gap between its costs and revenues
widening still further to Dollars 731m in 1993, its annual report shows.
The state-owned corporation also performed poorly in getting its customers
to their destinations on time, with only 79 per cent of its short-distance
trains and 47 per cent of its long-distance services arriving punctually.
Although the number of passengers carried rose from 21.3m to 22.1m, revenues
of Dollars 1.4bn were far exceeded by expenses of Dollars 2.1bn, with the
result that Amtrak lost Dollars 33 for every ticket sold.
The year also brought the worst accident in Amtrak's history when the Sunset
Limited express from Los Angeles to Miami plunged into an alligator-infested
Alabama swamp in September, killing 47 people.
Technically known as the National Railroad Passenger Corporation, Amtrak was
set up by the federal government in 1971 to run the nation's loss-making
passenger train services.
These had previously been operated by the private railroad companies, which
now concentrate on their profitable freight operations and continue to own
the tracks.
Amtrak was expected to reach a position where revenues at least covered its
operating costs, but has proved unable to compete with air or road transport
for speed or convenience and has continued to rely on federal support for
its survival.
The annual report shows that the corporation is due to receive Dollars
771.7m in federal funds this year, of which Dollars 351.7m is earmarked for
operating losses and the rest for capital spending. But these sums are
unlikely to reverse the steady decline in Amtrak's physical assets, which
are ageing more rapidly than the corporation can afford to replace them.

Assurances Generales de France (AGF) has appointed Mr Antoine
Jeancourt-Galignani to its board of directors.
This is seen as paving the way for his likely appointment on Wednesday by
the government to the presidency of the state-controlled insurance group.
The 57-year-old banker, who heads Banque Indosuez, had already been widely
tipped to succeed Mr Michel Albert, who, after more than a decade as the
president of the insurance group, was earlier this month named to the new,
independent monetary policy committee set up to advise the Bank of France.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Winterthur Insurance, Switzerland's third largest insurer, is set to buy a
substantial minority stake in DBV Holding, an insurance unit of Germany's
Commerzbank.
Both Winterthur and Commerzbank have scheduled press conferences for Monday
morning. Commerzbank said last week it hoped to announce during January a
restructuring of its non-banking financial activities. Winterthur said
yesterday it would announce 'a very important expansion of its insurance
business'.
DBV, with insurance premium income of approximately DM3.5bn (Dollars
2.03bn), was set up by the King of Prussia in 1871 to provide insurance
cover for the German military. It later expanded to cover civil servants,
taking on the name Deutsche Beamten Versicherung, and in the 1970s became a
general insurance company.
The acquisition would be Winterthur's second attempt to establish a strong
base in the German market. In 1987, it bought a 38 per cent stake in
Nordstern Allgemeine of Cologne with the intention of gradually winning
control.
However, Colonia, a German affiliate of the French UAP insurance group,
retained its majority control of Nordstern, and Winterthur eventually gave
up and sold its stake.

FT  17 JAN 94 / International Company News: Dow Corning puts cost of
litigation at Dollars 1.24bn
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Dow Corning, the US's biggest manufacturer of breast implants, said
yesterday that it expected its share of an industry-wide settlement of
litigation over leaking implants to reach Dollars 1.24bn.
The company, a joint venture between Dow Chemical and Corning, said that
Dollars 600m of this would be met by insurance companies, leaving it with a
pre-tax charge of Dollars 640m, or Dollars 415m after tax, for the fourth
quarter of 1993.
The scale of the potential costs have raised fears that Dow Corning may not
be able to continue without support from its two own-ers.
The company said yesterday, though, that it would be able to 'meet ongoing
operational needs,' provided the expected payments from insurers were
received and its 'evaluation of current financing arrangements' and future
business prospects proved correct.
Yesterday's announcement came as Dow Corning and other implant
manufacturers, including Baxter International and Bristol-Myers Squibb,
continue to negotiate over how to divide between them the costs of a
tentative Dollars 4.74bn industry-wide settlement.
This has still to be confirmed by the courts.

FT  17 JAN 94 / International Company News: Brussels solves gas sale problem
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Belgian government has chosen a Belgian solution to the difficult
privatisation of SNI-NIM, the state holding company which owns 50 per cent
of Distrigaz, the country's gas supply and distribution monopoly.
The government has agreed in principle to sell most of its 83 per cent stake
in SNI-NIM to Ackermans &amp; van Haaren, a quoted Antwerp-based industrial
holding company. If Ackermans agrees to the government's conditions, the
deal should raise about BFr14.5bn (Dollars 397m) to help ease Belgium's
budget deficit.
The decision - part of the government's BFr85bn four-year privatisation
programme - puts an end to rival bids for a stake in Distrigaz, lodged by a
range of international investors, including British Gas.
The government wants to keep tight control over Distrigaz, through a 'golden
share,' and is also insisting that an unspecified stake in the company -
probably between 10 and 25 per cent - is floated on the Brussels stock
exchange.
The government will retain ownership of certain other SNI-NIM holdings,
including its 6.6 per cent stake in Sabena, the national airline.
British Gas, VIAG and Bayernwerk of Germany, and Conoco, the oil and gas
subsidiary of DuPont of the US, had made a rival offer for Distrigaz, and
BASF, the German chemicals group, had expressed a separate interest in
Distrigaz shares.
Instead, the 50 per cent stake will be sold initially by Ackermans to
Tractebel, the quoted Belgian utilities group which owns a further 33 per
cent of the gas company. Apart from the stock market flotation, Tractebel
has also promised to cede small stakes in Distrigaz to regional energy
companies in Belgium. The remaining 17 per cent of Distrigaz is owned by
Shell.
The government said it hoped to conclude a deal with Ackermans by the end of
the month, and then seek European Commission approval for the sale.
Apart from its energy holdings, SNI-NIM's main investments are in financial
companies, transport and engineering groups.
Politically and financially, the disposal of SNI-NIM is the most complex of
the planned privatisations. Last year, the government agreed to sell half of
CGER-ASLK, the state-owned network of bank and insurance branches, to
Fortis, the Dutch-Belgian financial services group, for BFr35bn.

FT  17 JAN 94 / International Company News: Kaufhof seeks Horten control
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Kaufhof Holding, the Cologne-based retailer, is seeking to acquire majority
control of Horten, the Dusseldorf-based group which is Germany's fourth
largest department store chain.
According to the Reuter news agency, the Federal Cartel Office in Berlin,
Germany's competition authority, has received an application for the move,
which will mean further consolidation in the German department store sector.
It follows the acquisition of Hertie, the third largest department store
chain in Germany, by Karstadt, the biggest, a transaction announced in
November last year. This merger gave rise to speculation that Kaufhof would
counter the move from its arch rival by increasing its existing 12 per cent
stake in Horten.
It is thought likely that Kaufhof will at first buy the 26 per cent stake in
Horten owned by Westdeutsche Landesbank, the Dusseldorf-based public sector
bank, before buying stakes held by other large shareholders.
The acquisition will mean further expansion for the Metro Group, the
privately-owned Swiss retailing group which controls Kaufhof as well as Asko
Deutsche Kaufhaus, another of Germany's largest retailers.
Although the move is understandable in the context of the Hertie/Karstadt
fusion, it is out of line with Kaufhof's declared strategy of concentrating
expansion in the specialty retailing segment of the market.
The department store sector has suffered from the decline in German consumer
spending as well as a move to the specialty segment.

change in the accounting treatment of certain benefits to employees after
they leave the company.
However, it said that, excluding this charge and costs for a previously
announced restructuring programme at its computer subsidiary NCR,
fourth-quarter net income was expected to be about Dollars 1.15bn, or 85
cents a share, in line with analysts' estimates.
The accounting change, which all companies must adopt by the fiscal first
quarter of 1994, means separation payments must be expensed as they
accumulate over employees' working lives, rather than booked as they are
identified. Also, disability payments have to be expensed when the
disability occurs, rather than when payments are made.

FT  17 JAN 94 / International Company News: Tonen chief resigns over clash
with US partners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
A clash of US and Japanese management approaches has led to the resignation
of the head of Tonen, a Japanese oil refiner partly owned by Exxon and
Mobil.
Mr Nobuyuki Nakahara, Tonen president, is to resign at the end of March,
Tonen announced yesterday. It is understood that his departure is due to
differences over recent large dividend increases requested by the US
partners.
Exxon and Mobil, which each hold 25 per cent of Tonen's shares, are alleged
to have taken joint positions to obtain board agreement on dividends and
other important matters, such as capital spending.
The remainder of the equity is split among a group of Japanese institutions,
speaking for an estimated 40 per cent of the equity, and private investors.
Tonen and its US partners have denied there is a dispute. Mr Nakahara was
leaving because 'he wanted to become free to pursue personal interests,'
said Tonen. This is an unusual reason for a Japanese management resignation.
Mr Nakahara will stay on as honorary chairman, a symbolic position, and be
replaced as president by Mr Tamehiko Tamahori, who currently heads a Tonen
subsidiary and has the backing of the US shareholders.
The contrast between US and Japanese approaches first became apparent when
Tonen nearly doubled the 1992 payout to Y50 per share, easily exceeding
earnings of Y28.7 per share.
That attracted attention in Tokyo, because the payout of 174 per cent of
1992 earnings, represented just over 4 1/2 times Japanese companies' average
dividend of about 38 per cent of earnings that year.
Tonen's Japanese management at the time said Mobil and Exxon had requested
the increase and said they would have preferred to bolster capital
investment reserves.
However, the dividend increase was agreed unanimously by the board, said Mr
Haruo Gotoh, manager of Esso Sekiyo, Exxon's Japanese unit. The 3 per cent
yield on Tonen's shares is still low by US and UK standards, he said.
The US partners successfully obtained an increase in the interim payout from
Y12.5 per share to Y20, and have pushed for a maintained 1993 dividend.
The dividend is likely to be uncovered by earnings again, despite a sharp
rise in profits from Y32.77bn to a market estimate of Y38bn.
However, Tonen's balance sheet is strong, with debts of just under 51 per
cent of shareholders' capital.

FT  17 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Graham Group flotation to occur early this
year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BTR has confirmed that it is planning to float off Graham Group, a building
and agricultural materials subsidiary, early this year.
No timetable for the listing has yet been announced, but a pathfinder
prospectus for a public offer and placing is expected within a few weeks.
The flotation is likely to value Graham Group at about Pounds 200m.
There are two main businesses within the group: Graham Builders Merchants, a
supplier to the building and plumbing trade, with 148 branches, and Goodman
Croggon, an agricultural hardware wholesaler, with 10 branches.
The group employs almost 3,000 people, and in 1992 had a turnover of about
Pounds 350m. It is the UK's fourth largest builders merchant, with about 5
per cent of the market.
Mr Gordon Yardley, a non-executive director of BTR, is to become
non-executive chairman of Graham Group. He was formerly executive director
of the BTR division which includes the group.

FT  17 JAN 94 / International Company News: Austria's savings banks get
deadline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK BLUM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   VIENNA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Austria's savings banks have until the end of February to agree on radical
restructuring plans for the savings bank sector or face a solution imposed
jointly by Bank Austria, the country's largest commercial bank, and Erste
Oesterreichische Spar-Casse, a leading savings bank, according to Mr Rene
Alfons Haiden, BA chairman and chief executive.
Proposals by the Erste envisage the establishment of a holding company in
which all or most savings banks would participate.
This would be accompanied by a reorganisation of GiroCredit, which is both
clearing institution for the savings banks and a commercial bank in its own
right. Erste owns 21 per cent of GC.
Under the plan, BA, which holds almost 31 per cent in GC, would sell about
two-thirds of its holding to a consortium consisting of Erste, the
provincial savings banks and Austria Collegialiat Versicherung, a leading
insurance company. The shares would be held by the new holding company.
The plan however, has so far failed to generate much enthusiasm from
provincial savings banks, which fear they will lose power and influence as a
result.
However Mr Haiden says the discussion must end. 'We've been discussing
(proposals) for a year and a half, and that's too long.
'If (the proposals) are not successful, then it is the responsibility of
Bank Austria and Erste together to see what can be done and to take
responsibility for GiroCredit,' he said.
He added that this was likely to involve changes on GC's management and
supervisory boards, as well as a thorough re-assessment of the bank's
priorities and tasks. Such changes would have to be approved by an
extraordinary general assembly of GiroCredit shareholders as the next
general assembly is not due until the end of April.

The delay to the three-way merger first announced six months ago involving
Europa Minerals, a small London-quoted finance house, and two Australian
companies with which it is already closely linked - Austmin Gold and Burmine
 -will not be as long as recently indicated.
Burmine has been ordered by the Australian Securities Commission not to put
a resolution about the merger to its shareholders before an appeal hearing.
This hearing was originally scheduled for March 14 but, at Burmine's
request, has been brought forward to February 7.
The appeal is in connection with the rival bid for Burmine.

FT  17 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Midland &amp; Scottish offshoots' proposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two subsidiaries of Midland &amp; Scottish Resources which operate its Emerald
oilfield east of Shetland, have sent a proposal to their creditors for a
voluntary arrangement under the Insolvency Act 1986.
Trafalgar House, owner of the Emerald Producer rig, and MSR, owner of the
floating storage unit, have agreed to defer half the daily charter rates,
backdated to October 1 last year, until the unsecured creditors have been
paid 50p in the pound.
Banks were not prepared to advance the two subsidiaries further funds, and
MSR itself was unable to secure further funding as it had already granted
security on all its assets to lenders.
MSR said that creditors' approval of the voluntary arrangement would allow
an orderly run down and eventual abandonment of the Emerald Field at the end
of 1994 or in spring 1995.
Mr Jon Hawksley, MSR managing director, said the life of the field would now
depend on when the operating equipment could be redeployed. Without the
voluntary agreements, production, already below 16,000 barrels a day, would
have stopped this spring.

FT  17 JAN 94 / International Company News: Heineken withdraws from spirits
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Heineken, the Dutch brewer, is to withdraw from its last remaining activity
in spirits by selling its share of a distillery joint venture to its
partner, the Dutch food and beverages group Bols Wessanen.
Bols Benelux, a 50/50 joint venture, was set up in 1989 as a way for both
companies to combat the decline in consumption of spirits.
The venture, the biggest distiller in the Netherlands with brands such as
Bols, Bokma and Coebergh, is managed by Bols Wessanen, which wanted 100 per
cent control so that it can pursue further international expansion.
Heineken, which expects to book an unspecified extraordinary gain on the
transaction, noted that distilled spirits were always a small part of its
total business, which is firmly focused on brewing beer.

FT  17 JAN 94 / International Company News: Treuhand in big east German
utility sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Treuhand, the German privatisation agency, will tomorrow sell a majority
stake of a large eastern German utility group to PreussenElektra, the
electricity division of Veba, and Germany's second largest utility company.
The sale, which follows a long drawn out dispute about ownership rights of
eastern Germany's utility assets, will be followed by the privatisation of
the region's remaining 14 utility groups to RWE and Bayernwerk, western
Germany's other two largest utility companies.
PreussenElektra, which owns and operates nuclear, hard coal, and brown coal
power stations, will acquire the eastern German regional utilities of
Frankfurt/ Oder, Magdeburg, Neubran-denburg, Potsdam and Rostock.
It is expected to invest at least DM800m (Pounds 312.5m) in the modernising
and upgrading of the power stations. Veba and its other subsidiaries plan to
invest DM8.4bn in eastern Germany over the next four years.
The sale will give Preussen-Elektra a virtual monopoly over the generation
and distribution of electricity in the region as a result of the
Stromvertrag, or Electricity Contract signed in 1990 between the former east
German and west German governments.
Under the terms of the contract, west Germany's utility companies are
legally permitted to own 51 per cent of eastern Germany's fifteen utilities
groups, with the remaining 49 per cent held by the municipalities.
However, in order to underwrite investments of about DM46bn by western
German utilities, the contract stipulated that eastern Germany's regional
utilities must, over the next 20 years, buy 70 per cent of their energy from
Veag, eastern Germany's largest major utility company. This group is
controlled by western Germany's eight electricity companies, including
Preus-senElektra.
However, Veba officials said that although PreussenElektra will enjoy a
virtual monopoly, they added that the company fears increasing competition
from the gas sector, as well as a continuing decline in energy consumption.
Energy consumption in eastern Germany has fallen 40 per cent since 1989
largely due to the collapse of manufacturing.

FT  17 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Trifast to raise Pounds 15m via SE listing
next month
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Trifast, one of the UK's largest manufacturers and distributors of
industrial fasteners, plans to go public on the London Stock Exchange next
month in a flotation expected to raise about Pounds 15m.
The deal will reduce the stake of the two founders, Mr Mike Timms and Mr
Mike Roberts, from 90 per cent to between 30 and 50 per cent, and leave a
sum of about Pounds 3m-Pounds 4m for the Sussex-based company.
Mr Malcolm Diamond, who has been managing director since 1984, said this
would be used for overseas expansion, and to replenish finances after a
recent acquisition and the move of its Uckfield manufacturing operation to a
larger site.
Trifast, which trades as TR Fastenings, has some 70,000 different products
and world rights to the Hank Rivet Bush, a form of nut used to provide a
tapped hole in sheet metal, and the Binx Nut, a self-locking vibration-proof
nut.
About 35 per cent of its products are made in its three UK factories and the
rest is bought from suppliers in east Asia, Europe and elsewhere.
Mr Diamond said Trifast had weathered the recession well because of low
gearing - only 17 per cent even after last year's acquisition of
Edenbridge-based Fastener Techniques, a former rival.
Sales have risen from Pounds 17.6m in the year ended March 1990 to an
estimated Pounds 28m in the current year. Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds
1.45m in 1990 to Pounds 1.98m last year, and are expected to rise
considerably this year.
Trifast has benefited heavily from co-operation with its customers in
arrangements such as long-term partnership sourcing and fastener management,
reducing its exposure to the traditional customer/supplier relationship
where contracts are won purely on the basis of price.
Mr Diamond hopes the flotation will provide a springboard to further
expansion as Trifast's big computer and electronics customers move to
single-sourcing for fasteners and increasingly subcontract their assembly
work.
He wants to plug gaps in Trifast's network, notably in the Republic of
Ireland, and exploit untapped market opportunities.
But he also sees growth possibilities in the fragmented Pounds 350m-plus UK
fasteners market, where Trifast has a market share of just 7 per cent
overall. Acquisitions of merchant distributors are one possibility, he said.
James Capel are brokers to the company.
The pathfinder document is expected on January 26.

Magnet/Carpetright/MFI
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
What goes around comes around, was Mr Alan Bowkett's summation of Berisford
International's Pounds 56m acquisition of Magnet, the kitchen and joinery
group, last week. That is certainly the conclusion to be drawn from the
conjunction of three pieces of news: the Magnet deal, Carpetright's interim
results this Thursday and MFI's interims next week.
The three events mark the reappearance in public companies of retailers from
the late 1980s. The fashion at that time was for leveraged buy-outs. It
proved a particularly unsuccessful one. Sir Phil Harris sold his Lowndes
Queensway business in 1988, setting up Carpetright shortly afterwards, and
then saw it go under in 1990.
MFI's MBO was done in 1987, which at least gave the group a couple of good
years before the downturn in consumer spending caused by high interest rates
 -which also crippled heavily indebted businesses - pushed it into a
refinancing in 1989. It was then that Magnet's management undertook its
Pounds 629m buy-out, which proved so disastrous for the backers.
While Lowndes Queensway went into receivership - although its Carpetland
business was bought by management in 1991 - and Magnet's parent company went
into receivership in 1992, MFI has been a survivor.
With MFI back on the stock market in 1992 and Carpetright in 1993, this year
will see the return of Magnet if Berisford's reverse takeover is approved by
shareholders.
Now the hope is that trade is picking up once more. Magnet last week
indicated that current sales were good. Analysts expect a good rise in
interim profits from Carpetright to between Pounds 5.2m and Pounds 5.5m.
Similarly, forecasts for MFI's interim results next week centre on Pounds
22.5m pre-tax, up from Pounds 12.7m, excluding the profit on MFI's sale of
Carpetright shares.

FT  17 JAN 94 / Metals group wins backing for rescue: David Waller recounts
how Metallgesellschaft was brought back from the brink of collapse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Metallgesellschaft, the German metals, mining and industrial group, staved
off the threat of bankruptcy this weekend after winning agreement to a
revised DM3.4bn (Pounds 1.3bn) rescue package.
At a 10-hour meeting on Saturday, representatives of 120 creditor banks
buried their opposition to initial rescue proposals and approved new plans,
averting what would have been Germany's biggest corporate collapse since the
AEG electrical group went bankrupt in 1982.
The talks took place behind closed doors at the Frankfurter Hof hotel in
Frankfurt. Shortly before 9pm Mr Kajo Neukirchen, the restructuring expert
appointed chief executive last month, emerged to tell a scrummage of
reporters that the company had been rescued.
Appearing alongside him was Mr Carl Boehm-Bezing, the Deutsche Bank director
who chaired the talks. Mr Boehm-Bezing explained that the terms of the deal
had been modified to take account of 'understandable' criticism from foreign
banks.
Without giving many details, he said that German banks had increased their
commitment to compensate for foreign banks' reluctance to go along with
parts of the package. Deutsche and Dresdner banks, which each own more than
10 per cent of MG's shares and count among its biggest creditors, would
provide nearly half the DM700m of fresh loans to the stricken conglomerate.
This reverses the pair's previous position that they would lend no more
money on top of the emergency DM1.5bn which they supplied last month.
Mr Neukirchen declared that it was his mission to restore the group's
tarnished reputation. Metallgesellschaft, founded in 1881 by an Englishman,
has a turnover of DM27bn, 258 subsidiaries and 58,000 employees.
With the talks concluded but for a few formalities, Mr Neukirchen said it
was time to concentrate on restructuring the group. He was planning to sell
the Kolbenschmidt car components company, as well as a trading operation in
the Netherlands and some mining activities. About 10,000 employees were
likely to lose their jobs with the aim of saving DM700m a year.
Saturday's talks were convened after both domestic and foreign banks refused
to back the original proposals by last Wednesday's deadline.
The deal envisages a DM1.4bn rights issue, the conversion of DM1.3bn of bank
debt into junior convertible stock and the provision of DM700m fresh credit.
The broad outlines of this package are the same as originally proposed, but
the details have been modified in favour of foreign banks.

FT  17 JAN 94 / Global fix modifies German work-out
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
As Mr Carl Boehm-Bezing of Deutsche Bank jumped out of his chauffeur-driven
S-Class Mercedes and hurried up the steps of the Frankfurter Hof on
Saturday, he was asked whether he was confident that a deal would be reached
to guarantee the survival of Metallgesellschaft, Germany's fourteenth
biggest company.
'Of course I am confident,' he answered, through clenched teeth, as he went
in to chair a meeting of 120 bank creditors. But it was not until 10 hours
later that he appeared in front of a pack of journalists with Mr Kajo
Neukirchen, MG's chief executive, to explain that a deal had been done.
Confidence was in short supply as the Wednesday deadline for the refinancing
negotiations came and went without agreement. First Norddeutsche Landesbank,
the Hanover-based bank to the state of Lower Saxony, then a clutch of French
institutions voiced objections so vociferous that they threatened to derail
what one MG official described as 'the biggest rescue operation since
Dunkirk'.
Bankers recognised from the start that they would lose far more money if the
group were allowed to go bankrupt than if it were bailed-out. But equally
there was no doubting the sincerity of bankers' opposition to the terms of
the original deal, as presented to them in the first week of January.
Brinkmanship was thus underscored by genuine passions and on Thursday and
Friday of last week the group's future looked far from certain.
Objections focused in part on what NordLB called Deutsche Bank's
'dictatorial' style in trying to bully through a 'take it or leave it'
solution with no room for negotiation. Foreign bankers - representing more
than half the 40 banks with the biggest exposure - went further, accusing
Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank of trying to implement a German-style
solution without taking account of international norms for such refinancing
packages.
'They were trying to play it like another German work-out, but it is a
global fix you need here,' said one foreign banker last week. 'It was very
much Germany Inc and could have done with more internationality,' said a
German working for a foreign bank after the talks on Saturday. 'We will all
learn something from this.'
One banker noted that such negotiations were always characterised by a
fierce battle between shareholders and bank creditors seeking to protect
their different interests. But the situation in Metallgesellschaft's case
was complicated by the fact that Deutsche and Dresdner banks were not only
big creditors but also big shareholders.
Representatives of the two banks sit on MG's supervisory board, making them
in some eyes partly responsible for the mess which they were trying to clean
up.
'There was a feeling that the big banks had their own agenda and that we did
not know the full story,' said one banker, complaining about the lack of
independent advisers to the negotiations. Similar sentiments showed through
in the French banks' insistence that they receive more information about
MG's financial condition.
'In the end it was a question of who blinks last,' said another banker.
Deutsche and Dresdner, with the backing of the German financial community -
after NordLB came into line - enabled a deal to be done by giving in to the
foreign banks' demands that they make a larger contribution.
The talks ended with a round of applause for Mr Neukirchen, MG's chief
executive, and Mr Boehm-Bezing. Bankers said yesterday that they were
pleased with the final package. 'This is the best possible solution for all
those involved and especially for MG,' said Mr Rick Polet, of the Dutch ING
Bank.
MG's survival has been guaranteed, and Mr Neukirchen will be able to
exercise his fabled restructuring skills. on putting the group back on its
feet. In the boardrooms of the big German banks there will be time, now the
deal has been done, to conduct a extensive post mortem.

FT  17 JAN 94 / Company News This Week: A stronger finish than expected - US
banks
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Some of the US's biggest commercial banks will put the cap on a record year
when they report results this week. The stock market had already been
expecting a strong fourth quarter, but early figures released by two banks
last week suggested that the numbers may be even better.
A bevy of the biggest banks are due to report tomorrow: the New York
money-centre banks Citicorp, Chemical and Chase Manhattan, along with the
biggest 'super-regionals', NationsBank and BancOne. BankAmerica and Bankers
Trust come later in the week.
Bank stocks sagged last autumn, when investors began to anticipate a decline
in interest rate margins from record levels. Few believe the banks can
repeat the bumper trading results earned in the middle of the year.
JP Morgan and Citicorp gave the market pause for thought with figures
released last week (Citicorp gave an outline when announcing the sale of
Quotron to Reuters). Each took write-downs and/or restructuring charges, yet
ended with stronger profit growth than most had expected.
For JP Morgan, the figures were underpinned by advances in all of its main
businesses, including trading. Citicorp will not release details until
tomorrow, but is expected to report higher-than-expected revenues, in part
from its retail banking operations in developing countries.

FT  17 JAN 94 / Iri announces shape of next Italian bank sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Iri, the Italian state holding company, has announced that it will privatise
its 57 per cent stake in the Banca Commerciale Italiana (BCI) in February. A
minimum of 40 per cent of the shares being sold will be reserved for a
public offering.
The bulk will be set aside for Italian and foreign institutional investors,
with a limit of 2 per cent set on each institutional investor's holding.
The decision on the size of institutional stakes has been the subject of
intense lobbying. Mediobanca, the Milan merchant bank, is widely believed to
have wanted to aquire a big foothold in BCI. The latter currently has an 8
per cent interest in Mediobanca.
By opting for diffused share ownership, Iri is following a similar path to
that of Credito Italiano, its first bank privatisation in December. As in
the Credito divestment, a 1 per cent ceiling has been imposed on individual
investors purchasing via the public share offering.
Iri currently holds 482.1m ordinary shares while a further 88.6m savings
shares will be converted by February 11. It said that it expected to retain
some 30.7m shares to exercise, if necessary, an over-allotment option. A
further 40m would be offered to BCI employees.
In a related move on Friday, Iri set in motion the process of unwinding a
deal arranged last March with its telecommunications arm, Stet. This
involved a L340bn (Pounds 130m) cash payment by Stet to Iri's hard pressed
treasury to cover the use of three years' anticipated dividends from BCI.
The deal covered 440m shares, equivalent to 52.3 per cent of the total BCI
shares. Stet last year received L137.5bn in BCI dividend payments.
A price has yet to be placed on Iri's stake in BCI, which has net assets of
L6,900bn and generated a 1992 operating profit of L,1380bn. Lehman Brothers
are advising on the offer and the promotional roadshow is due to begin on
February 11.
At Friday's close, BCI shares were being traded at L4,900. If a similar
strategy is adopted to that of Credito, then the discount would be near to
10 per cent. In this case the offer price would be about L4,400, with Iri
likely to receive around L2,500bn from the disposal.

FT  17 JAN 94 / Investors cast eye outside Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Institutional investors in the UK are shifting their attention away from
continental European markets and towards Japan and the US, according to a
survey by stockbrokers Smith New Court and Gallup, the market research
group.
For the first time since October 1992, a balance of fund managers said they
were planning to reduce their holdings of European shares. Last month,
opinion was almost equally divided on whether to raise or cut holdings,
while previous months showed balances of 20 per cent or more in favour of
increases.
There has also been a marked rise in the number intending to increase their
Japanese exposure: a balance of 39 per cent of managers planned to do so,
compared with 8 per cent last month. Interest in Japan is at its highest
level since October 1991.
A balance of 11 per cent planned to raise US equity holdings.
The appeal of the UK stock market has dwindled, with a balance of 5 per cent
planning to increase their UK holdings, compared with 27 per cent in
December. But there has been a sharp shift in favour of medium-sized FT-SE
250 companies, rather than the FT-SE 100. Only 20 per cent of managers
preferred FT-SE 100 stocks this month, compared with 42 per cent, while
those favouring FT-SE 250 stocks leapt from 49 to 74 per cent.
The three favourite UK sectors were media, leisure and hotels, and building
materials and merchants. The least liked were banks, property and food
retailers, although banks and property companies were among the favourites
in last October's survey.
Managers continued to be optimistic about the UK economy, with 22 per cent
expecting it to get much better in the next 12 months and 72 per cent
expecting a little progress. However, 71 per cent said inflation would be
rising more rapidly in a year's time.
Base rates were expected to be half a percentage point lower in three
months' time.
Some 89 institutions, managing a total of Pounds 799bn, took part in the
survey last week.

FT  17 JAN 94 / Company News This Week: Oil price weakens Elf's last figures
before privatisation - Other companies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Elf-Aquitaine, the French state-owned oil group which is slated for
privatisation, will announce its provisional results for 1993 tomorrow.
Mr Philippe Jaffre, who took over as chairman last August, has already
warned that profits will see a sharp fall from FFr6.2bn (Pounds 710m) to
just over FFr1bn. The decline reflects the weak oil price, the write-down of
certain oil assets and Mr Jaffre's desire to clean up the group's balance
sheet ahead of Elf's privatisation, which is due to be launched later this
month.
Chrysler: The US car manufacturer is expected to report strong fourth
quarter figures tomorrow. The domestic car and light truck market is
enjoying solid growth, with sales up 8 per cent in 1993, and Chrysler has
been faring particularly well thanks to a strong line-up of new high-margin
vehicles.
Its December sales were up 7 per cent on 1992 and were its strongest for the
month in five years. Forecasts of fourth quarter earnings per share range
from Dollars 1.37 to Dollars 1.90, with a mean around Dollars 1.60.
Volvo: Shareholders will elect a new seven-man board on Wednesday, following
the clear-out that accompanied last month's collapse of the planned merger
with Renault.
Mr Bert-Olof Svanholm, chief executive of the Swedish operations of Asea
Brown Boveri, is expected to be confirmed as chairman, with Renault chief
executive Louis Schweitzer also gaining a seat. Nominations to all seven
posts have been made by shareholders accounting for at least 40 per cent of
Volvo's votes and are unlikely to be opposed.
Gestetner Holdings: The UK-based office and photographic equipment
distributor is expected to announce full-year pre-tax losses of up to Pounds
38m on Thursday after taking a Pounds 48.3m provision at the interim stage,
mainly to cover the restructuring of its European operations.
The results will be the last before Inchcape, the international services
group which bought 15.3 per cent of Gestetner in May, must decide whether to
exercise its option to acquire convertible unsecured loan stock, enabling it
to lift its stake to 24.6 per cent. The exercise price on the option, which
expires on July 1, is equal to 172p a share - well above the current 140p
level.
Photo-Me International: The world's largest photo-booth manufacturer and
operator is likely to show first-half pre-tax profits little changed from
last year's Pounds 10.5m, when it reports tomorrow.

FT  17 JAN 94 / Major faces fresh test at Scott inquiry today: PM's
performance will be closely watched
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major's political authority faces a fresh test today when he gives
evidence to Lord Justice Scott's inquiry into whether the British government
illegally sold arms to Iraq in the late 1980s.
Mr Major's appearance before the inquiry marks the first time that a serving
prime minister has given evidence to a judge in public.
The session's political significance has been heightened even further by the
scandals and party infighting that have shaken his leadership since
Christmas, amid tensions between Downing Street and sections of the tabloid
press, traditionally staunch Tory supporters.
Mr Major's position has been damaged by two ministerial resignations,
allegations of gerrymandering by Tory-led Westminster council and a cabinet
split over the nature of the prime minister's 'back to basics' policy.
Cabinet colleagues were confident yesterday that the prime minister would
not be implicated by the inquiry. However, several ministers emphasised that
Mr Major's demeanour - and the manner in which he responds to
cross-examination - will be closely scrutinised, amid signs that he has
failed to enforce cabinet unity around his leadership.
Weekend newspaper reports that Mr Major had spoken derisively about some
rightwing members of his cabinet at a Downing Street dinner party last week
fuelled the controversy about the 'back to basics' policy and how it
impinges on issues of personal morality.
Mr Tony Newton, the leader of the House of Commons, said yesterday that
reports in The Sun and the Daily Mail - which said that Mr Major had told
guests he would happily dismiss any one of the Cabinet rightwingers - were
untrue.
'I do happen to think that some of the ways the press have treated things in
recent days fell a good deal short of what is desirable,' Mr Newton said on
BBC radio.
Sir Marcus Fox, the chairman of the backbench 1922 committee, also claimed
that the reports were part of a vendetta by the press against Mr Major.
'There are one or two people in Fleet Street . . . who make no secret of the
fact that they do not like this administration,' he said.
The comments have served to underline the deteriorating relationship between
the prime minister and some tabloid newspapers.
Moreover, the government appeared far from certain how to approach the more
sensitive areas of the 'back to basics' policy. It was confirmed yesterday
that Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, had postponed publication of
a blueprint on housing policy, fearing that its research into allegations of
queue-jumping by single mothers did not stand up to scrutiny.
Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, added to Tory gloom by claiming that last
November's Budget demonstrated that the Tories' manifesto commitments could
not be trusted.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro bowed yesterday to popular pressure for a
complete renewal of Italy's political establishment and dissolved parliament
less than 20 months after the country's last general elections.
New elections to be held on March 27 - the date set by the cabinet - will
mark a sharp break with Italy's post-war political traditions.
The scale of the uncertainties ahead led President Scalfaro to use his
constitutional powers to the limit in not accepting the resignation of Mr
Carlo Ciampi, the prime minister, last Thursday. In the interim Mr Ciampi
will govern as caretaker prime minister. The introduction of electoral laws
which adopt a first-past-the-post system for 75 per cent of the
parliamentary seats will move Italy away from the post-war era of fragmented
multi-party politics towards a limited number of large groupings.
The weakened status of the traditional parties, discredited by corruption
scandals, and new electoral laws mean the elections will be fought by
untried political alliances.
The centre ground, long dominated by the Christian Democrats, is in
disarray. Only the former communist Party of the Democratic Left has in
place a viable alliance which can muster about 40 per cent of the vote.
President Scalfaro gave three reasons for dissolving the legislature. The
most important, he said, was the 80 per cent vote in last April's referendum
favouring electoral reform.
Second was the outcome of the two sets of local elections in 1993. If these
results were projected on to parliamentary polls the four-party majority
backing the Ciampi government had less than 20 per cent of the vote.
Finally, President Scalfaro said the series of corruption scandals had
undermined both public confidence in, and the credibility of, the current
political class.

FT  17 JAN 94 / Insurers may be forced to accept new watchdog
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is drawing up plans to force life insurers to be regulated by
the Personal Investment Authority, the new City watchdog due to come into
being this year.
The decision of three leading companies to oppose plans for the authority,
which is intended to act as the self-regulatory organisation for the entire
retail financial sector, has infuriated ministers. They have interpreted the
move as an attempt to destabilise the proposed regime.
Ministers are planning to close a loophole in existing legislation that life
insurers could use to avoid being regulated by the PIA. They could opt to be
directly regulated by the Securities and Investments Board, which would
undermine the PIA's authority.
If companies opt to be regulated by SIB, the government is expected to ask
the board to subcontract the responsibility for regulation back to the PIA.
If the life insurers continue to refuse to acknowledge the PIA's authority,
ministers are prepared to bring forward legislation forcing companies to be
regulated by the appropriate self-regulatory organisation.
The creation of the PIA is central to the proposals put forward by Mr Andrew
Large, SIB's chairman, to improve regulation. The proposals have been
strongly backed by Mr Anthony Nelson, Treasury economic secretary.
In a debate in the Commons last week, Mr Nelson warned that if the existing
system failed to protect investors, 'the House will have to look at it
again. I do not have a closed mind'.
The latest exchanges about future regulation of the sector arose after a
statement was issued by Standard Life, one of the UK's largest life
insurance companies.
It announced the withdrawal of its support from the plans for the PIA, on
the basis that as only nine of the 19 directors would be active industry
practitioners, the body would not be a truly self-regulatory organisation,
and that statutory regulation was therefore preferable.
Standard Life's decision is understood to have caused particular anger
within government.
According to a Whitehall official, ministers were surprised that Mr Norman
Lessels, Standard Life's chairman, allowed his deputy managing director, Mr
Jim Stretton, to resign from the PIA. Mr Lessels is also on SIB's board.
Some officials believe that Mr Lessels' position on SIB's board could become
untenable if Standard Life does not drop its opposition to the PIA.

FT  17 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: UK gilts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The poor performance of gilts so far this year might have convinced the Bank
of England not to hold a gilts auction in January. That it has chosen to do
so after all comes as something of a relief. It means the authorities have
enough confidence in the market to get a sale away. The 15-year maturity
range is also one which should meet reasonable demand from domestic
investors anxious to buy longer-dated paper which has been in short supply.
With sterling already strong and international markets wobbly, this is
probably not a time to rely too heavily on foreign money.
These arguments, though, would have pointed to an even longer-dated issue of
25 or 30 years. That the Bank chose to stick to a 15-year maturity
underlines a different dilemma. Rightly or wrongly, the market perceives it
has chosen not to borrow over 25 years at rates around 6.6 per cent because
that would undermine the credibility of its anti-inflation policy. Were it
to do so, the market would assume it had decided long yields had reached
their trough. That in turn could spark a nasty sell-off.
Somehow the Bank needs to find a way of getting itself off this hook.
Funding pressures are lower than they were a year ago, but they are still
considerable. It does not help if the Bank limits its scope to borrow across
the entire yield curve. Nor is it good for the market to be deprived of
liquidity at the long end. Perhaps the Bank should start by issuing an
ultra-long tap after the auction to get investors used to the idea again. If
it insists on waiting, it is bound to miss the boat.

FT  17 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Aluminium
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The upward drift of aluminium prices points to optimism that output cuts can
be agreed when producing countries meet this week in Brussels. Given the
large overhang of stocks, though, it will take more than token measures to
restore the market to balance. Reducing world output by perhaps 1.5m tonnes
a year would be enough to erode stocks and allow base metals bulls to push
aluminium higher. Anything less would be a disappointment. Failure to reach
any sort of agreement would rightly drag the price back towards the lows
plumbed in the final quarter of last year.
Sharing production cuts between Russian producers and those in the west is
the most difficult task. The gap between US demands for a 1m tonne capacity
reduction from Russia, and the Russian offer of 300,000 tonnes, will not be
bridged easily. It is difficult to believe that threats of anti-dumping
litigation from US producers will encourage a settlement. More imaginative
solutions - such as using western aid to upgrade Russian smelters, which
would reduce output for a spell - might help.
But Russia will be unwilling to shoulder the burden of real cutbacks alone,
not least because aluminium exports are a useful source of hard currency.
Alcan's decision last week to cut 156,000 tonnes annual output may set the
tone for a wider agreement if other western companies are willing to follow
the lead. Experience in basic industries suggests that, even if overall
targets are agreed, a lengthy period of haggling among European and North
American companies will follow.

FT  17 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Securities settlement
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After the expensive blunder that was Taurus, London's new paperless
settlement system was always likely to involve compromise in the interests
of a quick fix. But the Bank of England is anxious to give institutions the
opportunity to remain on company share registers even though the shares are
held in nominee accounts under its new Crest system. Such designation might
help protect pension funds against unauthorised selling or borrowing against
their assets. The snag is that it adds enormously to Crest's complexity,
since many large bargains would have to be broken down into their component
parts.
Support for designation is understandable in the wake of the Maxwell affair.
The Goode committee report on pension fund law reform, delivered to
government in September, said it should be encouraged wherever practical.
Yet Goode stopped short of recommending that designation should be made
compulsory, on the grounds that the only real protection against loss of
pension fund assets is better supervision of administrators and fund
managers. Designation is no protection against a fund manager determined to
act beyond its powers.
If designation can be incorporated within Crest without jeopardising the
project, though, the Bank is right to stick to its guns. Fund managers
freely admit that most of their pension fund clients are likely to opt for
designation if it is available within Crest. With the security of pension
funds at stake, the customer is surely right.

FT  17 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Hungry for change
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's food retailers will be glad to have seen the back of 1993. The big
three grocers were among the seven worst performing FT-SE 100 stocks last
year. The sector as a whole underperformed by 34 per cent. This year has
started off in better mood with the sector bouncing 15 per cent from its
November floor, outperforming the market by 5 per cent over that time. There
have been some encouraging trading noises from Wm Morrison and Waitrose. On
Wednesday, it is hoped Tesco will add to the good news. Given the lull in
the price skirmishes, it is perhaps tempting to anticipate a further run in
the shares.
Falling gross margins may ensure the sector's earnings growth will lag the
market for the foreseeable future; especially so if Tesco follows Argyll in
depreciating its expensive assets. Yet the financial strength of leading
grocers should enable them to maintain attractive dividend growth. Asda may
have outperformed the sector recently but, in the longer term, it may be
seen as perverse for the market to favour the weak in the industry over
stronger companies like J. Sainsbury.
Yet, in truth, the current bounce may reflect little more than income-hungry
investors chasing the sector's yield down to the market average. Some
rebound is also natural after so savage a fall. Much further appreciation
will have to rely on a dose of inflation, a reduction in store capacity or
some successful diversification. With the benefit of hindsight, the
misguided wave of rights issues in 1991 resulted in too much capital being
hurled at the market. Some capacity will have to be removed before the
bigger companies can resume growth.

FT  17 JAN 94 / Venables: the questions - Former Spurs boss Terry Venables
is a leading candidate to take over as England's football manager. Martin
Bashir and Mark Killick raise disturbing concerns over his business dealings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN BASHIR, MARK KILLICK and BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Terry Venables, the controversial former chief executive of Tottenham
Hotspur, stands on the verge of the promised land.
According to the headlines, he is about to become the next manager of
England, the most important job in British football. He is the choice of
much of the football establishment, the media and of fans desperate for
success after England's ignominious exit from the world cup last year. But
the delay in making the appointment indicates unease at Lancaster Gate, the
home of the Football Association: Mr Venables may be a tainted man.
Among other things, the FA has been considering allegations made four months
ago by Panorama, the BBC current affairs programme. Panorama said that some
of Mr Venables' business activities were 'unlawful' and that he had 'abused
his position' at Tottenham Hotspur, one of Britain's top football clubs.
While Mr Venables has threatened to sue Panorama, he has failed to deal with
substantive charges made in the programme. Since the BBC investigation,
there has been a number of additional charges made across the media.
The charges might not matter if the England manager were responsible only
for picking the team. In fact, he assists in scheduling matches, appoints
coaching staff and is involved in commercial activities such as sponsorship.
He is also England's most important football ambassador. As a result, there
is pressure to choose someone whose reputation is beyond reproach.
The task of reaching a judgment on Mr Venables has confused the football
authorities. On the one hand, he is widely regarded as a first class,
internationally-experienced coach. He is also available. On the other hand,
there are the doubts about his business life. So far, Mr Venables has
responded to the charges with general denials which leave questions
unanswered.
Sir Bert Millichip, the FA chairman, was quoted at the weekend as referring
to Mr Venables' 'funny reputation'. Also, the fact that Mr Venables still
has an unfair dismissal action pending against Mr Alan Sugar, the chairman
of Spurs, raises the uncomfortable thought that the next England manager
could be locked in litigation against the boss of a leading club.
The most damaging allegation against Mr Venables concerns the way that he
raised Pounds 1m to pay for part of his Pounds 3m stake in Spurs. Mr
Venables, along with Mr Sugar, bought control of the club in June 1991.
Prior to this buyout, Mr Venables was being paid Pounds 175,000 a year as
manager of Spurs. He is not a rich man. Official documents show that Mr
Venables had to borrow heavily to finance the deal - Pounds 2m from Norfina,
a finance company, Pounds 250,000 as an unsecured loan from a friend and
Pounds 750,000 'from his own resources'. A year later, he was in trouble
with his loan repayments. A letter from Norfina in August 1992 pointed to
outstanding interest payments of Pounds 36,301.37 and threatened to call the
loan into default, demanding full immediate payment.
But the most searching questions surround the Pounds 1m Mr Venables raised
from Landhurst Leasing, a company which went bust, also in August 1992 and
which is now the subject of a Serious Fraud Office investigation. This deal
appears to have involved Mr Venables pledging assets of another company of
which he was once a director, Transatlantic Inns. Prior to its collapse in
1992, Transatlantic managed a handful of pubs. Its main assets were the
premises' fixtures and fittings.
Mr Venables, through his personal company Edennote, entered into a sale and
leaseback agreement with Landhurst, in which he in effect 'sold' the pub
fixtures in return for the Pounds 1m, and then leased the fixtures back,
making regular payments to Landhurst. This type of deal allows a business to
raise money against the value of its assets while continuing to use the
assets to trade.
A document signed by Mr Venables and two Landhurst directors on August 30
1991 confirmed the deal. The agreement names Edennote as the lessee and
refers to an attached schedule of equipment. The schedule refers to 'all
structural fixtures and fittings, bars, kitchen equipment, audio equipment,
furniture and carpeting' from four pubs: Maceys in London, The Cock and
Magpie in Epping, the Granby Tavern in Reading and the Miners in Claremount
Road, Cardiff.
An obvious point is that Pounds 1m is a large sum to set against some worn
pub fittings, which a professional valuer has suggested were worth in the
region of Pounds 100,000. Such valuation gaps, however, are not unknown in
sale and leaseback, where the leasing company believes a business is trading
well enough to meet its payment terms.
What cannot be so easily explained is why the fourth pub on the list, the
Miners in Cardiff, does not exist. Nor has an explanation been offered for
the fact that, according to Transatlantic's accounts, filed at Companies
House, Mr Venables resigned as a director of Transatlantic Inns on June 28
1991, two months before he entered into the transaction.
Mr Colin Wright, a director of Transatlantic, said yesterday: 'We were
horrified when we discovered that all of the assets of Transatlantic had
been used by Mr Venables to raise a Pounds 1m loan. None of the directors of
the company had authorised such a transaction. The implications were
terrible for us. We could have been looking at a massive tax liability and
to the outsider it could appear that we were involved in this deception,
which we knew nothing about.'
The cash, meanwhile, had gone into Edennote just six days before most of it
was used to buy shares in Tottenham. To help the leaseback deal along,
Landhurst was paid an arrangement fee by Edennote, and also received a perk.
Mr Venables instructed Spurs' marketing department to provide Landhurst with
a Pounds 20,000 executive box at Spurs, free for the entire season.
Panorama tracked the flow of cash into and out of Edennote, using
bookkeeping data prepared for the company, copies of which have been given
to the programme. These show that the quarterly leaseback payments of Pounds
55,812.50 to Landhurst specified in the original lease document were made as
agreed, for example on November 8 1991, and January 15 1992.
Mr Venables has declined to be interviewed about these matters either by
Panorama or the Financial Times. According to a letter from his solicitor,
Burton Copeland, to the FT: 'It is neither right or appropriate for Mr
Venables to enter into a detailed dialogue of matters that will, in due
course, be fully ventilated before the court.'
Mr Venables' solicitor did address in the letter, however, the question of
the lease agreement on the pubs, with the comment: 'It is not accepted that
Mr Venables signed the lease that you refer to as being dated August 30
1991.'
However, a director of Landhurst at the time of the deal confirms that Mr
Venables signed it and that the deal was a sale and leaseback undertaking of
the kind outlined, based upon the assets of a number of pubs in which Mr
Venables had an interest. A copy of the document is in Panorama's
possession.
The general picture painted appears clear. Mr Venables urgently needed cash
to buy his shares in Spurs and he raised it, at best, without regard to
legal niceties. Others familiar with the Landhurst transaction say that it
was a deal based essentially upon personal trust between Mr Venables and Mr
Ted Ball, the founder of Landhurst.
Since the programme, the Inland Revenue has been examining Mr Venables'
affairs. The Department of Trade and Industry has also expressed an interest
in Edennote, though its concerns are wider than the lawfulness of the sale
and leaseback deal. It has examined Mr Venables' offer documents for
Tottenham Hotspur, in which Mr Venables claimed that Edennote 'will have
equity of Pounds 1m' and that Pounds 750,000 would come 'from his own
resources'. In fact, the Pounds 750,000 had been raised from the pubs deal
and the company's file shows no record of any increase in its authorised
share capital from the Pounds 12,500 at the time of the offer.
Panorama's second tranche of business-related allegations revolved around Mr
Venables' financial adviser, Mr Eddie Ashby. According to the programme, Mr
Ashby used a venture capital company called Elite Europe to try to build an
apparently wide-ranging business group. It was partly financed by money from
companies in which Mr Venables had a significant interest, including
Glenhope and Scribes West International, a club in Kensington, now the
subject of a winding-up order.
Mr Ashby prepared a balance sheet for Elite Europe, apparently showing
assets of Pounds 597,000, and then used it to try to borrow substantial sums
from at least two finance houses. This scheme failed when one of the
companies featured in Elite's bid to raise funds realised its assets had
been grossly overstated and promptly severed all contact with Elite. While
Mr Venables had some knowledge of Mr Ashby's activities, it is not clear
that he knew of Mr Ashby's ultimate plan.
What Mr Venables indisputably did know was that Mr Ashby had been made
bankrupt in 1992, with debts of Pounds 443,212. Mr Ashby also had 39
business failures to his name. Despite this, Mr Venables appointed him as
Tottenham Hotspur's general manager shortly after the takeover and he
remained in post until Mr Venables was dismissed.
Mr Venables' persistent relationship with Mr Ashby has been a source of
acute concern to some of those responsible for making the decision about the
England managership. There has even been talk that Mr Venables could be
offered the job, so long as he agrees to sever links with previous business
associates.
For many of England's long-suffering fans, Mr Venables' behaviour as a
businessman is irrelevant. Some argue that his record as a soccer manager is
unblemished. However, a number of serious questions have also been raised
about his dealings within the game.
Panorama examined the sale of Paul Gascoigne to the Italian club, Lazio. The
selling process began in March 1991, some three months before Mr Venables
and Mr Sugar bought Spurs. Mr Dennis Roach, a football agent, was employed
to find a buyer and Lazio was persuaded to pay Pounds 6.7m for England's
most talented player. But, during the FA Cup Final in May, Gascoigne
suffered the worst injury of his career and the deal had to be renegotiated.
Lazio still wanted Gascoigne, but not at the old figure. Negotiations
recommenced and in early June revised terms began to take shape.
On June 20 1991, one day before the Venables-Sugar takeover, Lazio's lawyers
sent a fax to Spurs offering Pounds 5.5m for Gascoigne - the price at which
the deal was ultimately done. The player signed for Lazio on August 1 and
according to board minutes a payment of Pounds 27,500 was made to Roach for
his services in the deal.
However, Spurs paid a much larger sum, of Pounds 200,000, to Anglo European,
a Swiss company, which acknowledges that it was only employed by the club
from July 12, to assist Mr Venables in the negotiations. Mr Venables has
admitted that Mr Gino Santin, a friend and London restaurant owner, helped
in the transaction; Mr Santin has described himself as an employee of Anglo
European. Panorama asked why Mr Venables persuaded the Spurs board to agree
such a large payment when the deal appeared to be virtually complete.
Mr Venables' solicitor told the Financial Times that the payment was made
with the approval of the directors on the grounds that Mr Santin had 'given
considerable value in the form of the services that he had rendered in
connection with the transfer of Paul Gascoigne'. Mr Venables has also said
in other press articles that Mr Santin was crucial in adding a number of
valuable elements to the deal, apart from the price. These include the
proceeds of interest payments on an escrow fund established during the
negotiations and the proceeds from two Spurs-Lazio matches, including TV
rights.
A detailed inspection of the club's records, however, has revealed that the
escrow account interest payments were agreed in May, the games in early June
and Sky TV has confirmed that TV rights were negotiated directly with Mr
Sugar.
The programme also uncovered a number of payments that contravened Football
Association rules. One invoice, for example, came from First Wave
Management, an agency which lists a number of professional footballers as
its clients. It sought Pounds 58,750 for 'the assistance in arranging a
distribution and merchandising network on behalf of Tottenham Hotspur'. In
reality, it has since been admitted by Mr Frank McLintock, the former
Arsenal player who runs First Wave, that part of this payment was for
assisting in the transfer of a player from Nottingham Forest to Tottenham.
The FA stipulates that clubs should not pay agents for procuring players,
but Mr Venables signed the invoice and it was paid in cash.
Despite the seriousness of these allegations, Mr Venables remains the
favourite to lead England out of the international wilderness. In narrow
footballing terms, appointing him may be the correct decision. But the job
of England manager demands more than just soccer skills and the FA has a
responsibility to ensure the highest standards off, as well as on, the
field. Unless Mr Venables can answer these outstanding questions, the FA may
have no alternative but to rule him out of the game.

<TEXT>
To lose one chairman is unfortunate; to lose two within a year is careless.
That's the case with Hungary's AV RT state holding company, overseer of half
the country's economy.
Szabolcs Szekeres picked a number of fights with his political masters
during his brief, four-month tenure at the top of AV RT. He condemned
electricity privatisation; defied ministers by offering foreign investors
the chief executive's job in the telecoms company Matav; and gave grudging
support for the government's privatisation programme.
The clash may also have been cultural. Szekeres was a re-emigre, a
Hungarian-American returned from exile; they tend to have short public lives
in today's Hungary. Szekeres' predecessor, Pal Teleki, also a re-emigre, met
a similar fate last June.
The government may play safe next time. Lajos Csepi, currently managing
director of the State Property Agency privatisation authority, and who has
impeccable bureaucratic credentials, is front-runner for the empty chair.

Bill Foggitt, the weather sage from Thirsk, thinks Britain may face a heat
wave this summer. Unmoved by recent heavy rainfalls - 'it hasn't been much
different than normal in Thirsk' - he reckons August may be unconventionally
steamy.
'We had a good summer in 1990. That coincided with the Gulf War. It was a
beautiful day when war broke out in September 1939 and we had a very hot
summer in 1940.
Forebodingly, he adds that 'Russia could be on again. I could see the
Bosnian Serbian conflict overflowing into Macedonia and into Russia. It
could lead to nuclear war.'
Was he forecasting Armageddon? 'No, that's the name we give an old lady who
goes into the Three Tuns.'

FT  17 JAN 94 / Observer: Miracle man
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Des Wilson, the veteran public campaigner now working for Burson-Marsteller,
hopes he can work miracles. Hence he was rather upset when no one took any
notice of his latest marvel - getting the Church of England to drop its
opposition to the National Lottery.
Des had also got the church to back his own pet project: helping Richard
Branson and Lord Young win a licence for a lottery whose profits would go to
charity. David Sheppard, Bishop of Liverpool and chairman of the Church of
England Board of Social Responsibility, last week issued a press release
explaining why he hoped that the licence would go to 'a company committed to
passing on the largest possible proportion of profits to charity'. Quite a
PR coup.
So how come no one took any notice? Maybe because Sheppard's press release
carried a rather stale December 24 dateline. Perhaps the C of E is rather
touchy about miracle workers making unjustified claims.

Thai bankers have a nice line in cynical humour. Chulakorn Singhakowin, Bank

bridge the chasm between rich and poor in Thailand. 'As a banker basically
you have very little opportunity to rip off the poor,' replied Chulakorn,
'You try to rip off the rich. All Thai banks are currently lending to people
who don't need the money - classical banking.'

FT  17 JAN 94 / Observer: Portillo plays the bard
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If only all John Major's ministers displayed the kind of erudition shown by
Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, in his speech last Friday
to the Conservative Way Forward President's annual dinner.
Portillo, earmarked by some Tories as favoured candidate eventually to
succeed Major, gave a rousing address on 'one of the greatest threats that
has ever confronted the British nation' - nothing less than 'national
cynicism'.
He recruited one of Shakespeare's least-performed plays, Troilus and
Cressida, in support of his thesis. The play, he said, 'explains how order
in society depends upon a series of relationships of respect and duty from
top to bottom.' He then lengthily quoted Ulysses' speech in Act I scene iii:
'When degree is shaked
Which is the ladder to all high designs,
The enterprise is sick. . .'
But if Portillo had read a little further, he would have discovered that
Ulysses ends by depicting a scene today's cabinet may find quite familiar:
'The general's disdain'd
By him one step below, he by the next,
The next by him beneath: so every step,
Exampled by the first pace that is sick
Of his superior, grows to an envious fever
Of pale and bloodless emulation.'

FT  17 JAN 94 / Leading Article: Gaidar departs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
'I cannot at one and the same time be in government and in opposition to
it.' So did Mr Yegor Gaidar, architect of Russia's reforms and leader of the
largest reformist party, Russia's Choice, justify his refusal to serve as
first deputy prime minister. His judgment was right. The question is where
this leaves President Boris Yeltsin, Russian reform and the western
governments that have tried to sustain them both.
In justifying his announcement, Mr Gaidar pointed to decisions to forge a
monetary union with Belarus and spend Dollars 500m on a new parliamentary
building. The second of these is outrageous, but the first is serious.
The ability of the central banks of other members of the rouble zone to
expand Russia's money supply at will made monetary control impossible. In
the last two months these credits had been turned off. Now, fear the
reformers, the monetary spigot will be turned on once more.
Of the other economic reformers, Mr Anatoly Chubais may continue to run
privatisation, though the benefits of that flagship policy will be gravely
compromised by the willingness of the state to supply money it does not
have. Mr Boris Fyodorov, the finance minister, has not yet decided whether
he will serve. But his conditions include the departure of Mr Viktor
Gerashchenko, the chairman of the central bank, something he is about as
likely to obtain as Russia is to embark on coherent reform. Mr Grigory
Yavlinsky, who may take Mr Gaidar's place, is a firm believer in an economic
union among the successor states of the former Soviet Union. But he has
radical hopes for de-monopolisation, which are virtually certain to be
disappointed.
Except perhaps in the first few months of 1992, Russia has never enjoyed
what people in the west would call a government. The government has been
more like a parliament, while parliament tried to govern. This is the knot
Mr Yeltsin hoped to cut by dissolving the old parliament. Unfortunately, his
brave gamble failed. He now confronts a parliament that is more legitimate
and more firmly opposed to reform than before. Ostensibly, he possesses
greater powers himself, but it is doubtful whether he can use them.
Mr Gaidar's departure clarifies the challenge facing the president. Mr
Yeltsin must decide whether he is cohabiting with his opponents or in charge
of the government. He cannot be both. At present, the new government looks
doomed to be one of the printing press and the half measure, of
nationalistic assertion abroad and craven weakness at home. If so, Mr Gaidar
is well out of it.

FT  17 JAN 94 / Leading Article: Italy's debt to Mr Ciampi
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Italy's political landscape is about to be redrawn. With President Oscar
Scalfaro's dissolution of parliament ahead of new elections in March, the
interim government of the technocrat prime minister, Mr Carlo Azeglio
Ciampi, is near the end of its life. The next government will almost
certainly be chosen from parties quite different from the ones that have
dominated Italy since the second world war. The obvious question now is
whether Mr Ciampi and his predecessor, Mr Giuliano Amato, have carried out
the reforms needed if Italy is to enjoy a good chance of stability under the
new regime. On balance, the answer is yes.
Two successive budgets have attacked the huge fiscal deficit and government
debt, the highest among major OECD countries. In 1992, there was a primary
budget surplus (before interest payments) for the first time in over 30
years. On a cyclically adjusted basis the overall budget deficit is set to
shrink by 3 per cent of gross domestic product over the two years to 1993,
much the biggest fiscal tightening in this period among major OECD
countries.
Particularly impressive has been the willingness to tackle structural fiscal
problems, rather than repeat the one-off measures often used in the past.
Public employment, pensions, health care and local authority finances were
all dealt with under special powers obtained in October 1992. The 1994
budget, announced in September, aims to cut the fiscal deficit to 8.7 per
cent of GDP, largely as a result of expenditure cuts, the tax burden on the
country already being one of the highest in the OECD. The new medium-term
economic programme presented in July 1993 aims to stabilise the public debt
ratio by 1995 and reduce the budget deficit to 5.8 per cent of GDP in 1996.
The civil service has been made more efficient, while a far-reaching
privatisation programme, launched by the Amato government in 1992,
represented an attack not only on the fiscal deficit but on the historic
role of the state. Public banks, insurance companies, industrial firms and
utilities are all to be sold off.
Labour market reforms have also been instigated in an attempt to attack
high, rising and, in large measure, structural unemployment. Inflation
remains low and is likely to fall, despite the devaluation. Elimination of
wage indexation has greatly assisted the achievement of this objective.
Economic recovery depends in large part on the return of domestic
confidence, itself dependent on the success of the reforms. For this reason,
the switch to a new electoral system is an important step. The lack of
domestic confidence has left exports, strongly stimulated by the 20 per cent
effective devaluation of the lira since September 1992, to play a large part
in sustaining economic activity.
Much remains to be done. The momentum of fiscal consolidation must be
maintained, since the government deficit is estimated to be 9 1/2 per cent
of GDP in 1993 and public debt is 114 per cent and rising. It will also be
important to secure effective regulation of privatised utilities, prevent
privatised companies from returning for fiscal hand-outs and improve tax
collection. Coping with the consequences for employment of shrinking the
public sector and privatising public-sector enterprises may be the most
difficult challenge of all.
The governments of both Mr Ciampi and Mr Amato have pushed reform forward
bravely. But the newly elected leaders of the republic must build on these
achievements if they want their country to take the place Italians seek in
the premier division of the European economic league.

FT  17 JAN 94 / Leading Article: Games duopoly
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sonic the Hedgehog and Super Mario Brothers have captured the hearts and
minds of children throughout the world. But, at a cost of anything up to
Pounds 60 a time in the UK, video games are anything but cheap. Hence, last
week's decision by Britain's Office of Fair Trading to refer the industry to
the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
There is a strong prima facie case that prices are artificially high because
of insufficient competition. Sega and Nintendo, the two Japanese companies
which dominate the Pounds 9bn-a-year global market, have a combined market
share of over 90 per cent. They have used this duopoly power to earn fat
profit margins.
The duopoly's dominance is not confined to hardware. It embraces software
too, as anybody wishing to produce games to use in Sega's and Nintendo's
machines must first reach a licensing arrangement with the companies.
A further concern in the UK has been that video games are roughly 30 per
cent more expensive than in the US. This is partly because retailers'
margins and indirect taxes are higher in Britain. But it is also possible
that Sega and Nintendo are charging higher wholesale prices than in the US.
Their use of different technical standards on either side of the Atlantic
suggests that they may be segmenting the market in order to discriminate on
prices.
But even if the Monopolies Commission finds that the duopoly operates
against the public interest, it will face a tricky task deciding what to do.
One option would be to impose price controls. But such heavy-handed action
would prevent competition developing.
Another option would be to attack the licensing arrangements which enable
Sega and Nintendo to extend their dominance in hardware to software. Such an
approach would complement legal moves in the US and Britain by rival
software producers which wish to sell their games direct to customers
without paying royalties to the duopoly.
The snag here is that licensing arrangements are often global in scope, so
action by the UK alone could have only limited impact. Many software
suppliers might not wish to compete aggressively with Sega and Nintendo in
Britain if they were still tied to them in other markets.
The final option is to do nothing and allow market forces and technological
advances to undermine Sega's and Nintendo's dominance. That may seem a
cop-out. But given that Sony and Matsushita, the Japanese consumer
electronics giants, have been tempted into the market by its high margins,
inaction may not be such a bad idea.

FT  17 JAN 94 / Wrapped in a mutual embrace / A look at progress towards
economic integration in Latin America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM and ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the presidents of Brazil and Argentina meet in a tiny Uruguayan
colonial town today, long-running arguments are likely to be heard around
the table. Brazil and Argentina are at loggerheads over Argentine complaints
that it is a dumping ground for cheap Brazilian industrial products.
But the two presidents might pause and contemplate how much has already been
achieved in integrating their two economies in Latin America's largest
free-trade area. After decades of virtually ignoring each other as export
markets, largely because of trade barriers and a preference for selling to
Europe and North America, the two countries are discovering their mutual
attractions.
The free trade initative, known as Mercosul in Brazil and Mercosur among its
Spanish-speaking neighbours, was signed in March 1991 between Brazil,
Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay. It called for the free movement of capital,
goods and services between the four countries, and for the establishment of
a common tariff system for trade with non-Mercosul countries by the end of
this year. Tariffs on goods ranging from Roquefort cheese to metal doors
have already been cut by up to 80 per cent.
But trying to set up in four years what took the European Union nearly 40
has led to problems.
Brazil and Argentina, which account for more than 95 per cent of Mercosul's
GDP, have been arguing since the middle of last year about which industries
should enjoy special protection. They are now expected to announce a list of
goods, for example Brazilian telecommunications, which would retain local
rather than common external tariffs until the end of the century. This would
protect sensitive sectors from more efficient foreign competition.
Because of such exclusions, the original intention of totally free trade is
unlikely to be met by 1995, and will probably have to wait until later in
the decade or perhaps the next century.
But businesspeople in Brazil and Argentina say they are realising the
advantages of closer economic ties, despite the diplomatic disputes. Trade
is growing rapidly and looks set to continue to accelerate even if the
free-trade agreement does not meet its deadline.
Trade between the two countries increased 63 per cent to Dollars 4.93bn
(Pounds 3.33bn) in 1992, helped by falling tariffs. In the first quarter of
last year, the latest figures available, trade between the two grew 57 per
cent to Dollars 1.34bn over the same period in 1992. The growth, from a low
base, has mainly come from Brazilian exports of industrial products ranging
from cars to chemicals and Argentine exports of agricultural goods and oil,
reflecting the two economies' relative strengths.
Foreign and domestic companies are starting to look at Brazil and Argentina
as a single market. Autolatina, the holding company for Volkswagen and
Ford's combined operations in the two countries with an annual turnover of
about Dollars 8bn, last year completed a three-year programme to standardise
all products and parts for both markets, which were previously treated
separately. A new factory in Cordoba, Argentina, is now supplying about 90
per cent of the transmissions used in the company's Brazilian-built
mid-sized cars.
'These sorts of product decisions show our confidence in Mercosul. You don't
move production unless you are confident,' says Mr Pierre-Alain De Smedt,
president of Autolatina.
Food companies are making similar moves. Sadia, one of Brazil's largest food
companies, recently set up a joint venture in Buenos Aires with an Argentine
company to oversee distribution of its products.
Carlos Eduardo Sant'Anna, the Sadia director responsible for the joint
venture, says: 'Argentina is not just another foreign market, but the
foreign market for us. We see a belt that goes from Rio de Janeiro, Sao
Paulo, southern Brazil and Buenos Aires to Santiago (the Chilean capital).
Here you have 65 per cent of South America's GDP.'
Growth in trade has been rapid partly because Argentina and Brazil are
complementary economies. Argentina is rich in energy, Brazil is not.
Argentina last year became Brazil's second-largest oil supplier behind Saudi
Arabia. Most of Brazil's electricity is produced by hydroelectric dams,
whereas Argentina has a large thermal system.
Moreover, Argentina has big grain surpluses, while Brazil is a net food
importer. Argentina's industry is obsolete. If it is to grow, it needs the
economies of scale which free access to the much bigger Brazilian market can
provide. Brazilian industry is more competitive than Argentina's and is
attracted by the prospects of adding 33m Argentine consumers to the 150m in
Brazil.
Cross-border links are not just a corporate phenomenon. For example, tourism
is developing and about 700,000 Argentine tourists are expected to take
their holidays in Brazil this summer.
Argentines travelling to Brazil have brought back some of their neighbour's
consumption habits, such as a passion for ice-cold beer. Brahma, Brazil's
biggest beer company, last year began trucking bottled beer 1,000 miles from
one of its breweries in southern Brazil to Buenos Aires, aiming for a 3-4
per cent share of the Argentine market over the next two years. Now it is
planning a brewery near Buenos Aires.
Such links are fuelling tensions as well as growth. Some Argentine
industries, especially textiles, paper and steel, have complained of a flood
of cheaper Brazilian imports as tariffs have come down. In response,
Argentina started in 1992 imposing a number of protectionist measures, such
as anti-dumping measures against Brazilian farm machinery and spark plugs.
There are concerns in Brazil, too. In the southern Brazilian state of Rio
Grande do Sul, which borders Argentina and Uruguay, farmers are worried that
they will soon have to compete with products from across the frontiers,
where land is cheaper and the soil more fertile.
'Rio Grande do Sul is perhaps the state most threatened by Mercosul,
especially our products like jams, vegetables and wines, and these employ a
lot of people,' according to Mr Dagoberto Lima Godoy, president of the
state's federation of industries.
Companies on both sides say there are limits to how far integration can go.
Cultural differences are one reason. Brazilians prefer two-door cars while
Argentines prefer four-door models; and emission standards are higher in
Brazil.
Economic differences have also led to problems. Argentina boasts a growing
economy, with inflation running at an annual rate of 7.4 per cent last year,
but an overvalued peso. Brazil is plagued by annual inflation of 2,500 per
cent and an undervalued currency. This has led to Argentine claims that
Brazil is dumping products, an accusation hotly denied by the Brazilians.
Trade in services is still underdeveloped and faces restrictive government
rules which hinder foreign access to markets. A body to resolve trade
disputes, perhaps similar to the European Court, has been delayed because it
raised the sensitive issue of diminished sovereignty.
A very poor communications infrastructure is also a constraint. There are no
rail connections because each country has a different gauge. Goods therefore
have to be moved via often poor road networks, especially on the Argentine
side, and bureaucratic customs procedures. Lorry drivers usually have to
wait at the border for a day for paperwork to be processed. Because of
different rules on truck sizes, haulage companies have to swap trucks at the
border.
As with the free-trade agreement, progress towards tackling these
constraints is likely to be slow. Nevertheless, businessmen such as Mr De
Smedt of Autolatina are optimistic that solutions will emerge in the long
term and free trade will blossom. 'There is a positive trend. We feel there
is a willingness at government level to make it happen. The timing is not
certain but let's hope they manage it by the deadline,' he says.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms SYLVIA P WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Are British publishers aiming to dispose of one of their key assets -
the English language? Or is the American market the only focus of their
attention, despite the increase in British book sales over the recent
Christmas period?
I received two books at Christmas which give rise to such questions; one was
the well-reviewed Wild Swans - Jung Chang's autobiographical view of the
development of communism in China; the second Paul Merton's satirical
impression of the History of the Twentieth Century. Both were printed and
published in Britain and in each the authors in their introduction make
specific mention of the use of English words.
Therefore the authors cannot be pleased to see American spellings in their
books. One has a PhD in linguistics from a British university and teaches in
London, and the English language must surely be central to the work of an
essentially English humorist. Wild Swans contains examples such as 'somber'
and 'maneuvring' throughout. The Merton book is not consistent in its
choice, but just on one page we see a noun and its related verb both spelt
as 'practise', along with the use of 'offense'.
Is it by accident or design that the American rather than the English
version of the 'spell-checker' seems to be in use, when most word processing
packages offer both? No wonder that so-called 'typos' regularly appear in a
range of publications (although rarely in the FT).
Those seeking to learn and use the English language today, especially by
reading, and to understand its origins and nuances, must be thoroughly
confused.
This raises a final question. Should the government really be seeking
further to involve businesses in British education?

Sir, With particular reference to the letter from Harold Hughes (January

experience frontier crossing difficulties because, unlike all other EU

In the absence of such sensible documents British citizenship or legal

It is not the EU at fault; it is Britain that is behind the times, out of

FT  17 JAN 94 / Meistersinger school is now outdated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I confess that I was once a card-carrying member of the Meistersinger school
of training. I used to admire the strict German apprenticeship system which
has its roots in the medieval guild society depicted in Wagner's famous
opera. Like much of the UK economics establishment, I fervently believed
that a laisser faire approach to vocational training accounted for many of
British industry's failings.
Modern mastersingers do not claim that apprenticeships are needed in every
sector. But they do believe strongly in a formal system of vocational
qualifications, with minimum periods of study and strict examinations. They
are convinced that training cannot be left to the free market. Some
collective mechanism - either the government or quasi public entities such
as chambers of commerce - is deemed essential if workers are not to be
shortchanged.
Interventionists will be comforted to learn that top Clinton administration
officials such as Mr Robert Reich, the labour secretary, are greatly
impressed by continental European training methods. Time and money
permitting they will expand the role of the federal government.
Yet I have to say that my enthusiasm for public intervention on training is
waning. No country could flout the mastersinger rules more defiantly than
America. The educational system is unquestionably biased towards academic
studies. There is no national system of vocational standards such as Britain
is struggling to create. Companies are left largely to their own devices. A
ragbag of ineffectual public-sector training schemes is directed mainly at
the disadvantaged.
The US thus ought to be in a terrible mess. If the mastersinger school's
arguments were sound, the US would be bedevilled by shoddy workmanship and
poor service. Yet neither anecdotal evidence nor economic statistics bear
out these worries.
The service in US restaurants, hotels and department stores is generally
attentive and friendly even if employees lack formal vocational
qualifications. Plumbing and central heating systems are not constantly
breaking down. There is little evidence of blue-collar incompetence.
The macroeconomic figures are even more impressive. Contrary to some claims,
Germany and Japan remain less efficient than the US. Throughout this
century, the US has enjoyed much higher levels of manufacturing productivity
than any of its rivals. Most studies - including those by the Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and Development - indicate that it has extended
its productivity lead in the past decade. Its share of world export markets
is rising and it is doing particularly well in sectors such as capital goods
that require high levels of technical expertise.
The mastersingers must find the US's success baffling. According to their
theories, private-sector training efforts must be blighted by a serious
'market failure'. In free markets, companies will always spend too little on
training because they do not own their workers and so cannot prevent
poaching by free-riding competitors. Companies that save money by not
training, it is said, can afford to pay the slightly higher wages needed to
bid away workers from those that do. At root, this is the argument used to
justify a host of interventions, from publicly financed training schemes to
mandatory training levies.
Now it would be foolish to deny that fear of poaching does not sometimes
deter useful training. But the market failure is surely far less severe than
usually claimed. Provided markets are competitive, companies can make
profits only if they use all their resources efficiently. In most cases,
labour is the single most important resource. Are we to believe that the
efficient use of labour does not involve training? Are we to believe that
fear of poaching is more potent than fear of bankruptcy which is the only
long-term prospect for a company that fails to train its workers adequately?
And consider matters from an employee's point of view. Suppose I work for a
company that invests heavily in training. Am I going to be lured by the
prospect of more pay in the short run from a fly-by-night operator that
offers no training? What kind of long-run prospect would I have at a company
that does nothing to improve the skills of its workforce?
Of course, in any sector some companies will not provide sufficient
training. But this is tantamount to saying that some companies will always
be poorly managed: some companies will fail to use any of their resources
efficiently. Rather than becoming obsessed with training per se, the
challenge for policy makers is surely to sharpen corporate performance
generally. The lesson from the US is that lowering barriers to competition
is usually by far the most potent spur.
Consider the motor industry. Do even the mastersingers believe that training
levies or federal programmes to upgrade worker skills could have raised the
productivity of US car makers significantly in the 1980s? Surely it is
obvious to everybody that nothing could have had a more beneficial impact on
Detroit than competition from Japan.
In a Wagnerian guild economy, authoritarian training systems are essential.
Everybody needs to know their place and to possess the right paper
credentials. The state or a collective employer body must supervise
training. But in a market economy, the efficient level of training will be
determined automatically by the changing pattern of consumer demands.
If you find this conclusion unacceptably Panglossian, then please explain
the US's industrial record. The country that leaves training almost entirely
to the market has the highest level of productivity. End of argument.

   From Councillor RICHARD ARTHUR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, After the remarkable revelations about the City of Westminster's
decisions, your readers may well ask where Westminster gets its money from
in the first place.
As a neighbouring borough, with similar population but much higher levels of
deprivation, Camden gets Pounds 21m less per year from government grants.
Despite this, we have no problem in comparing key services nose to nose.
Camden's education results are better than Westminster's across the board.
Camden no longer uses bed and breakfast accommodation for homeless families,
while Westminster is still spending some Pounds 8m per annum on this very
unsatisfactory form of accommodation.
Surely the Westminster story stresses the need for the redistribution of
government and political favouritism? Only then can the average citizen know
that he or she is being dealt with fairly, as compared with someone the
other side of a borough boundary.

FT  17 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Right route to self-regulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr GEORGE GREENER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In the light of your leader ('An end to foot-dragging', January 12) on
the prospects for the Personal Investment Authority, we wish to declare our
support for the formation of a properly constituted PIA.
We believe it is our duty to work within the context of government policy
which we understand to be in favour of both de-regulation and
self-regulation. The industry must continue to seek ways to take
responsibility for and improve its own conduct and demonstrate that it can
make self-regulation work.
Since its inception, we have been strong advocates of the PIA - ensuring a
level playing field which will unify the industry, and win back the
confidence and respect of consumers.
In the vast majority of cases the industry discharges its responsibilities
to consumers both properly and professionally. The financial services
industry plays a vitally important role in family and business life, and it
is of great concern that it is not currently held in higher esteem.
Agreement on and support for a properly constituted, single regulator will
help to achieve this, while at the same time addressing those issues which
need attention. We are concerned to note the dislocations which are arising
in the building of that partnership; the PIA needs the support of all
practitioners in order to be effective.
We share some of the deep concerns being expressed about aspects of PIA, the
costs involved in establishing it and the nature of its governance. We do
not believe, however, that such problems are insurmountable. We believe that
a 'top-down' approach to the establishment of the PIA, with a supervisory
board comprising a majority of genuinely senior public interest members -
chosen for their objectivity and experience, overseeing an executive
committee drawn from practitioners - would produce the right solution.
The PIA remains achievable, but needs help to regulate effectively a
fast-growing and complex industry. We look forward to studying the PIA
prospectus, which we understand will be available very soon, and which we
hope will allay our residual concerns.

FT  17 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Use of foetus to treat infertility
'abhorrent'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From DENISE GETHING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I read with disgust your leader, 'Using the foetus to treat
infertility' (January 14).
The idea of using aborted babies to fulfil the desires of childless couples
is abhorrent. Is it not bad enough consciously to discard a baby without
extracting a la carte organs to boot?
Then there is the point of the child eventually needing to know who its
parents were. There, no doubt, would be incredible problems trying to
explain how its parent was killed and the child was a product of ovaries
removed before disposal of the foetus. The psychological impact would be
devastating.
Surely the option of adoption would be preferable to the above. At least,
for the child, there is something tangible to seek, should the occasion
arise.
Apart from the parental issue, it is immoral to dissect an unborn child to
satisfy the wishes of others. This issue is not something that should become
tolerable or bearable in time.
We, as human beings, are creatures on this earth and as with all the other
species, nature has its own method of population control. Why can we not
accept whatever lot we are given and live as nature intended?

FT  17 JAN 94 / Arts: BBC builds on public's interest - Architecture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What do opera and architecture have in common? They have both been seen as
elitist and remote and both face a battle to gain public appreciation.
Opera seems to be winning. There is now a vast popular interest in opera
throughout the UK, which is increasingly well-served by new and improved
theatres. The interest has also spawned magazines, tapes and discs and more
television coverage.
Much the same thing is happening to architecture. There is enormous public
interest in old and new buildings and landscapes, town planning, transport
and environmental concerns. The starting gate of this interest is often
do-it-yourself and home improvements, but it soon runs to wanting to
understand Baroque or gain a glimpse of Gaudi.
At last, television has caught up with the public's appetite and last week
we were offered two vastly different but significant programmes. The new
series of Building Sights is set in the US. This promises to be a very
enjoyable series and an important one because it demonstrates a literate,
amusing and enticing approach to wonderful buildings.
But worst things first. Last Tuesday's Late Show on BBC2 was a classic
demonstration of how not to interest your audience in architecture. It was a
significant programme because it must, surely, mark the end of the media
whinge about the state of architecture and the pathetic nature of the
profession's gloom.
The programme was presented by Martin Pawley, whose view that it is all up
for architects and that the decline in quality is largely the fault of
politicians and the public, is a deeply flawed one. He continued his crusade
against the sane criticisms of the public and the Prince of Wales, and
seemed to want to close the architecture debate for ever.
The recession was scarcely mentioned as a cause of the collapse in the
building industry and the temporary falling off of building projects. Many
professions have been marginalised since the Thatcher years and have had to
question their reasons for existence. Architects are suffering unemployment
but they also suffer from being trained to think they are gods before
learning through experience that they are merely mortal links in the
construction chain. These arguments were misrepresented by this one-sided
programme.
Many of the more ancient architects in the programme struggled to justify
their terrible mistakes of the 1950s and 1960s. Will they never give up? The
contempt they seem to feel for the public sends shivers up and down my
spine. The BBC must surely learn from this dreadful programme that there is
another way to encourage interest, concern and enjoyment in architecture.
The good news is that someone in the BBC has seen the light, and it must be
three cheers for the director of Building Sights, Sandra Goldbacher, and the
executive producer Clare Paterson. They had the good idea of asking eight US
architectural enthusiasts to look at their favourite 20th-century American
building and tell the viewers why they liked them. The formula is a simple
one. In the British series the atmosphere was usually stilted and cool: this
series is more professional and more fun.
The first programme was on that old rascal of American architecture, Philip
Johnson, telling us why he loved Grand Central Station in New York. Johnson
is over 80 but he was a spry, funny and sharp commentator on the passing
show in the 'most beautiful room in New York'. Seeing the station (built in
1913 by Warren and Wetmore) as the belly button of New York, Johnson
praised, not just the non-stop urban ballet but also the profligate
sumptuousness of the station. He saw the whole place in operatic terms - and
wonderful music accompanied his views. You could imagine the Lady of the
Camelias coming down that vast double staircase. The glory of the station
does 'give a vicarious graciousness to the ordinary man'. Grand Central is
'oysters for everyone'.
Philip Johnson compared the sumptuousness and mad generosity of the station
to today's thin and poverty-stricken architecture and thought that we lacked
enough 'papal tyrants, insane monarchs and dictators' ever to see this sort
of grand architecture again. For Johnson it was enough that Stalin built the
magnificent Moscow Metro.
It was a fine idea to let actress Diane Keaton show us the Ennis Brown House
by Frank Lloyd Wright in the Hollywood Hills (to be shown on Wednesday
January 19, BBC 2), and Jeff Koons, the kitsch artist, to show us the
Hancock Tower in Chicago (Jan 26). Keaton sees the concrete Mayan style
Hollywood house as one long sexual tease. It filled her with, 'prolonged,
unceasing, desire'. Frank Lloyd Wright you should be living at this hour.
All I need tell you about Jeff Koons and the Hancock Tower is that, in his
view, 'Mozart would have had a condo on 93rd'. There are eight of these gems
on BBC2 this winter - they have broken the mould of architectural programmes
on television. They have done architecture a great service and they
illuminate with humour. Watch them; they are also blissfully short.

Thames TV may have lost its London franchise but the company is still alive
and well (and nowadays part of Pearson, owners of the FT). Today's new
comedy Law And Disorder, with Penelope Keith playing a sports car driving
widow who combines the professions of barrister and writer of children's
books, is a Thames production. They begin (8.00 ITV) with a yarn about a hot
air balloon landing in a field and frightening a prize bull to death. If
that doesn't appeal, Horizon on BBC2 looks into the reasons why mammoths
became extinct a mere 3,500 years ago (8.00 BBC2).
In the second episode of John Mortimer's series about an auction house,
Under The Hammer, Richard Wilson , whom we are accustomed to see as the
irritable pensioner Victor Meldrew, finds himself romantically involved with
a younger colleague (9.00 ITV).
Cutting Edge shows what a nurse has to do to earn her Pounds 24 a day:
anything up to a 14-hour shift, and the tasks of waitress, cleaner, and
social worker (9.00 C4). If you missed the opening episode of Middlemarch it
is repeated on BBC1 (10.10).

FT  17 JAN 94 / Arts: Museum honours a jazz genius - Christina Lamb visits a
new exhibition celebrating the life and work of Duke Ellington
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dragon-like piano teacher, whose insistence on endless scales kills off
any early attraction to music, is a familiar image to many people. It is
easy to visualise the young Duke Ellington as a small, baseball-besotted,
Afro-American boy writhing on the piano stool as he was forced to practise
by the wonderfully named Mrs Marietta Clinkscales.
Fortunately, Ellington's interest was revived in pool bars around his home
town of Washington, DC; and during a summer job at the Poodle Dog Cafe he
was soon filling in when the pianist arrived too inebriated to play.
Ellington's 'Soda Fountain Rag', composed in 1913 at the age of 14 from bits
of songs he knew and set to the rhythms of the soda pullers, was the start
of a long and prolific career.
Known as Duke for his aristocratic bearing, Edward Kennedy Ellington turned
out more than 1,500 compositions including popular songs, instrumentals,
theatrical works, film scores and sacred pieces, most written while
criss-crossing the US on tours. His standards include such much-recorded
numbers as 'Sophisticated Lady', 'Satin Doll' and 'It Don't Mean a Thing (If
It Ain't Got That Swing)', although perhaps his most enduringly famous
single recording was 'Creole Love Call', made in 1927 with singer Adelaide
Hall who died in London only last year aged 92.
Ellington began his career at a time when sound recordings were in their
infancy and jazz was denounced in the press as 'ruining young girls'. But he
broke new ground constantly and his work has become the first of any jazz
artist to inspire the kind of serious study usually reserved for classical
composers. He is the subject of a new course at Harvard University, two new
books* and a major exhibition, Beyond Category: The Musical Genius of Duke
Ellington, in the Museum of the City of New York**, on the fringe of Harlem,
which will tour US cities until 1996.
The exhibition is based on 200,000 pages of documents and scores as well as
photos, concert programmes and other memorabilia saved by Ellington's son,
Mercer, and acquired by the Smithsonian Institute in 1988.
There are interactive video monitors where, by touching players on screen,
you can call up individual band members like Johnny Hodges, 'Tricky' Sam
Nanton or Cootie Williams, follow their careers, listen to their solos, and
see how each contributed to the Ellington sound.
Accompanied by Ellington's music, you can see the small Wurlitzer organ on
which he composed while on the road; the Medal of Freedom awarded by
President Nixon; the cross he always wore; programmes from the Cotton Club
and Carnegie Hall; and his first record sleeves.
Murals and life-size cut-out figures evoke scenes from his life - from his
youth in Washington, DC, as the pampered only son of a butler, to leading
The Serenaders in dance halls while painting signs by day.
Just as with the 'Soda Fountain Rag', Ellington always fashioned music out
of what he heard and saw, whether it was dancing at the Cotton Club or
simply people walking in the street.
But the characteristic Ellington sound really began to take shape in New
York in 1923 with the arrival of trumpeter Bubber Miley, whose use of mutes
created a growling effect, which transformed the band's sweet, melodic dance
music style to one that the critics dubbed 'jungle jazz'.
In spite of his natty dress and natural charm, Ellington found it difficult
to break into the hotly competitive Manhattan club scene. His big break came
in 1927 when he was hired at Harlem's Cotton Club. Through its nightly radio
broadcasts, the Ellington orchestra soon became famous nationwide.
Although a talented pianist, the band was his real instrument and he
attracted many great musicians. Many of his compositions were written
specifically to highlight the strengths of his players.
The band was noted for its fresh, improvised sound, yet this was the result
of constant work. Typically, Ellington would have an idea that the musicians
would try out and suggest changes. Then, he would go away and re-work it.
By the 1940s, Ellington's influence was everywhere. Yet, while his music was
loved by white society, colour prejudice meant that he and his players could
not eat in many US restaurants or get rooms in hotels  - a problem they
solved by renting a railway carriage for their constant tours. The late
1940s and 1950s were difficult times but Ellington kept going despite the
decline of big bands, the closure of dance halls and the advent of
television. By 1955, though, the orchestra was reduced to accompanying
ice-skaters at Flushing Meadow.
Just as the music world was writing him off, he made a stunning comeback at
the Newport jazz festival in 1956, where his 'Diminuendo and Crescendo in
Blue', written 20 years earlier, had the audience stomping in the aisles.
Duke at Newport became his best-selling album, he made the cover of Time
magazine and clinched a new contract with Columbia Records.
The 1960s were glorious years, culminating in 1969 with a celebration of his
70th birthday at the Nixon White House. In 1974, Ellington succumbed to lung
cancer - but he composed until the end from his hospital bed.
Once asked where his ideas came from, he said: 'Oh man. I got a million
dreams. That's all I do is dream all the time.' He could, however, never
have dreamt that he would, one day, be rated worthy of academic study at a
top university and a national exhibition.

FT  17 JAN 94 / Arts: Hamilton's Gaslight shines as a melodrama
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Few British 20th-century writers can be undergoing such a rapid
rehabilitation as Patrick Hamilton who died, even then almost forgotten, in
1962. Within the past year or so, there has been a new biography by Sean
French, a successful revival of Hamilton's play, Rope, at Chichester, and
now comes a thoroughly enjoyable Gaslight in Edniburgh.
In the 1930s Hamilton was a considerable literary figure, admired by such
fellow writers as JB Priestley, Noel Coward, Ivor Novello and Graham Greene.
The only question seemed to be whether he would be remembered more for his
novels than his plays. It was the plays that made him affluent. Hollywood
picked him up and there were movies of both Gaslight and Rope.
As his brother, Bruce, related in a biography published in 1972, it was
partly the money that drove Hamilton to drink, or at least allowed him to
drink to such excess in relative comfort. Clearly there were other factors.
Hamilton developed a rigid attachment to Stalinism and was a close
acquaintance of the writer, Claud Cockburn. He had strange ideas about
religion and disliked abroad.
Like many Englishmen, however, perhaps the key fact about him was that the
second world war interrupted his career. When the war was over, just like
Coward he went on writing. But the world had changed and reputations dipped.
After a decent interval, however, we can begin again to respect the old
crafts. Rope is a psychological thriller about a 'perfect murder' based on a
real case. Gaslight was originally presented as a thriller as well  - at
Richmond, then in London's West End in 1938.
In Kenny Ireland's revival, Gaslight has become more of a melodrama, and is
none the worse for that. Sometimes it comes close to comedy. Whenever
anything dramatic is happening, there is a tendency for heavy cello playing
in the background or the chiming of bells. It is not until the end that
there is a real frisson. This is when it becomes quite conceivable, even if
you know the text in advance, that the director will change it and Mrs
Manningham will slit her husband's throat instead of just teasing him.
The play was initially set in an unfashionable part of west London around
the end of the last century. It was a brilliant idea to change the place to
Edinburgh, which is even more appropriate, for much of the atmosphere is
heavy, formal and dour, but not without manners.
At least one passage might have been written for the Scottish stage. When
Mrs Manningham is introduced to a new medicine by the kindly former
detective Rough, she asks what it tastes like. 'Delicious]' Rough replies.
'Something between ambrosia and methylated spirits. Do you mean to say
you've never tasted good Scotch whisky?' Mrs Manningham remembers that it is
what her mother used to give her when she had a fever as a child: her
appreciation comes back, and gradually her sanity.
If there is a flaw, it is that the gaslights - which are central to the plot
 -never go down quite dramatically enough when there is a prowler upstairs.
Thus the really sinister element of the piece has been diminished.
For the rest, the acting and direction are terrific. Vivien Heilbron, in the
part first played by Gwen Ffrangcon-Davies, is a superbly neurotic Mrs
Manningham throughout. At the end, when she realises she is sane, she
becomes almost frightening in the potential use of her power. John Fraser as
Rough is an amiably Scottish former policeman, perhaps with too much of a
doctor's bedside manner. And David Rintoul as Mr Manningham is as elegant a
Victorian villain as you are likely to find.

FT  17 JAN 94 / Arts: Xerxes provides a sumptuous feast - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
How many modern Handel stagings get to enjoy revival for a fourth time
around? That is the rare and happy achievement of Nicholas Hytner's version
of Xerxes, deftly reproduced once more by Julia Hollander for the English
National Opera. The translation, too, is by Hytner - bright Restoration
pastiche for the arias, cocky fast-forwards to modern talk in the
recitatives, all of it singable. Hytner is a man of many parts.
Xerxes (Serse in the original Italian) is late-middle Handel, one of his few
semi-comic operas. Hytner treats the opera comically throughout, and not
just the buffo scenes. That entails only minor losses. The feast of arias
that Xerxes provides - there is a little duetting later on, and a final
septet, but otherwise Handel's Italian soloists had to reign supreme -
survives a bit of guying in the 'serious' numbers. Hytner laces the
statelier ones with loopy visual jokes in the background, just to keep
things going, and for some vehement arias he encourages cod extravagances:
while Xerxes' romantically despairing brother, Arsamenes, (Christopher
Robson) sings the last of his many laments, he shrivels into womb position
on the floor.
If Xerxes were a lofty melodrama like most Handel operas, grand Persian
panoplies and cohorts would seem de rigueur. But besides the comic
go-between Elviro (chirpily taken now by Paul Napier-Burrows), the main plot
itself is a frothy nonsense of lovelorn confusions. Hytner has transferred
it to an 18th-century spa (Persepolis is glimpsed in the distance), peopled
by starchily indifferent guests and grand, whey-faced servants, the better
to point up the absurdity of it all. It is not overdone, and David
Fielding's very pretty designs are rich in off-the-wall jokes.
The silly story is a frail reed for carrying a 3 1/2 -hour opera (this
Xerxes is bravely uncut), but the arias do make a sumptuous feast. Of the
seven excellent principals, Robson and Yvonne Kenny are old hands in the
show (neither in best voice, but alert and engaging nonetheless), and so are
the stalwart Louise Winter and Jean Rigby. in breeches-roles.
As Xerxes' commander Ariodates, Mark Richardson makes an impression of
character and fine musical sense out of all proportion to his meagre part.
The winning new Atalanta is Nerys Jones, bright-voiced and with the mobile
face of a clever sit-comedienne. The conductor Ivor Bolton, probably anxious
about the passing hours, occasionally hustles the score along too hard, but
he also realises much of the music in beautiful style. For Handelians, this
is an evening of many delights.

FT  17 JAN 94 / Business Travel: Don't be daunted by Poulet Frit Kentucky -
Non-French speakers need not worry / Montreal is an easy and enjoyable place
in which to do business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The signs to 'centre-ville', rather than city centre, as you leave Dorval
airport are a sign that Montreal is a North American city with a difference.
With the elegance, architecture and culture of a European capital, Quebec's
financial hub has a special ambience. Splendid museums, a fine symphony
orchestra and a dizzying choice of restaurants can make a business trip to
Montreal an enjoyable experience.
Nevertheless, visitors whose French is limited to a few tourist phrases (or
those who have yet to master the distinctive Quebecois dialect) may feel
nervous at the thought of getting around and doing business in the world's
biggest French-speaking city after Paris.
That discomfort is bound to increase on the drive from the airport.
Billboards and signs along the roadside are in French, and only French.
There is no Kentucky Fried Chicken in Montreal, only Poulet Frit Kentucky.
What once was called Craig Street is now rue St-Antoine. More recently,
Dorchester Boulevard, Montreal's main street, was renamed boulevard
Rene-Levesque, in honour of a Quebec separatist hero.
Although the travel agent may have booked a room at the Four Seasons or the
Queen Elizabeth, the taxi drops you off at Hotel Le Quatre Saisons or Hotel
Le Reine Elizabeth.
The city's newspapers - the only one written in English is the Montreal
Gazette - are filled with stories on the popularity of Quebec's French-first
nationalists. The Bloc Quebecois, which aims to make Quebec an independent
country by the end of the decade, won enough seats in last October's general
election to become the main opposition party in the House of Commons in
Ottawa.
Its provincial counterpart, the Parti Quebecois, is leading in opinion polls
in the run-up to provincial elections later this year. If it wins, it has
promised to hold a referendum on independence by late 1995, and to reverse
recent relaxations in the French-first language law.
With such a rise in nationalism, can a non-French speaking visitor possibly
enjoy a visit to Quebec, let alone seal a business deal there?
Relax. A knowledge of French is useful, especially in shops, restaurants and
in dealings with Quebec government officials. But it is by no means
essential. 'It's the bottom line that counts,' says Mr Howard Gosselin, a
Canadian who heads Barclays Bank's office in Montreal. 'If they can make
money by dealing with someone who doesn't happen to speak French, well, so
what?'
Although Montreal has all the appearances of a French-speaking city, it is
more accurate to call it bilingual. English is the mother tongue of about a
third of its 3.2m residents, including many members of the immigrant
community (known locally as 'allophones'). Before you have a chance to
mumble an apology to your Quebecois hosts for your mangled French, they are
likely to put you at ease with a tale in fluent English about their latest
trip to London, Moscow or New York.
Until the late 1970s, Montreal was dominated by pillars of the
Anglo-Canadian establishment such as Canadian Pacific, the transport and
resources conglomerate, Royal Bank of Canada, Sun Life, the insurance
company, and Alcan, the aluminium producer. But the rise of an assertive
group of Quebecois entrepreneurs, coupled with the departure of
English-speakers to Toronto in the late 1970s, when a form of independence
appeared to be on the horizon, has created a new business class of
well-educated French-Canadians.
Nowhere in Canada was support for the 1989 free trade agreement with the US
stronger than in Quebec. Montreal-based companies such as Bombardier
(transport equipment), Videotron (cable-TV) and Quebecor (printing and
publishing) are now among corporate Canada's brightest stars.
Montreal does, however, retain some hallmarks of a close-knit community.
Many business deals are still clinched over lunch in the city's somewhat
stuffy clubs, like the Mount Royal and the St James.
A handful of institutions, notably the Caisse de depot et placement du
Quebec (the public-sector pension fund), Hydro-Quebec (the power utility)
and the Desjardins financial services group, are very influential. Business
visitors would be well-advised to cultivate contacts in one or more of these
organisations.
'More than most other cities, there's a very genuine and fully developed
relationship between senior people in business, the universities and
government,' says Mr Reid Scowen, Quebec's delegate-general in New York.
'Everybody knows each other and works together.'
Barclays' Mr Gosselin adds that French-Canadians 'work hard and negotiate
hard, but they don't take themselves as seriously as others (North
Americans) do. There's a little more warmth in their attitude.'
According to a recent opinion poll published by Maclean's magazine, 40 per
cent of Canadians agreed with the statement that 'we should eat, drink and
be merry, for tomorrow we may die'. In Quebec, the proportion is 71 per
cent.
This zest for life is reflected in Montreal's array of fine restaurants.
Among businessmen's favourites in the old city are the swish La Maree (404
Place Jacques Cartier) and St-Amable (188 rue St-Amable). My own choice is
Claude Postel (443 rue St-Vincent): located in a former mortuary and yet to
be discovered by tourists or the corporate public relations set, it serves a
mouth-watering tarte de tatin (made with caramelised apples).
Popular spots in the office and shopping area south of McGill University
include Restaurant Julien (1191 avenue Union), Le Cintra (2072 rue Drummond)
and the more casual L'Actuel, whose speciality is mussels (1194 rue Peel).
Milos (5357 avenue du Parc), an informal Greek seafood restaurant, is a
10-minute drive from downtown.
But if you like to dine early, prepare to dine alone. Montrealers tend to
eat later than other North Americans. Most restaurants start to fill up only
after 8pm.
Montreal's top - and thus most expensive - hotels are the Ritz-Carlton and
the Four Seasons, which are close to each other on rue Sherbrooke Ouest. If
your business is in the old financial district around rue St-Jacques (still
known to old-timers as St James Street), the Hotel Inter-Continental on rue
St-Antoine Ouest and the less expensive Hotel Radisson Gouverneurs at Place
Victoria are convenient.
I usually try for a room at the Centre Le Sheraton on boulevard
Rene-Levesque. Although in many ways just another large, modern hotel, the
Sheraton offers good value for money in a good location (among other things,
it is the first stop on the airport bus route).
Quebec winters are brutal and long. A foreign visitor will be far more
miserable without the right clothing at this time of year than without a
French phrase book. Temperatures often hover for days at minus 15'C-20'C.
Streets and pavements are covered with a messy - and often treacherous -
combination of snow, ice, slush and salt.
Gloves, a warm coat (a lined raincoat will do) and rubber overshoes or boots
are essential. A hat is advisable. Anyone not used to walking on ice-flecked
pavements should take care, especially on the streets sloping down from
Mount Royal to the St Lawrence River. One wrong step and your lasting memory
of Montreal will not be a fine meal, but the bruises, soiled clothes and
embarrassment of being on your hands and knees in the middle of Beaver Hall
Hill.
Even this well-known landmark is now known by an incongruous official French
name: cote du Beaver Hall.

Virgin Airlines has started a new service to Dublin from London's underused

FT  17 JAN 94 / Business Travel: Fares for 'Le Shuttle' - Travel Update
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The cost of taking a car through the tunnel under the English Channel will
range from Pounds 220 to Pounds 310.
Eurotunnel, the Anglo-French company operating the service, plans to carry
its first fare-paying passengers on May 8, after the official opening by the
Queen and President Mitterrand.
The journey will take 30 minutes, compared with nearly an hour by hovercraft
and about 80 minutes by ferry. With the tunnel fares at airline levels,
competition promises to be tough: Channel Ferry operator Stena Sealink last
week announced fare cuts under a complete overhaul of its tariff structure.
Eurotunnel can afford to start dear: in the early months it will have
limited shuttle capacity and may be unable to meet demand. But as deliveries
of the special rolling stock to carry cars, coaches and trucks through the
32-mile tunnel build up and the frequency of shuttle departures increases
from two to four an hour, analysts think they may forced to reduce fares to
fill the spaces.

FT  17 JAN 94 / Business Travel: Costs that do not scrape the sky - New York
hotels charging less than Dollars 100 a night
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DON MUNRO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Travellers staying in New York hotels can have a nasty surprise: a nightly
19.25 per cent room sales tax, plus a Dollars 2 occupancy tax. New York City
levies the taxes on rooms costing more than Dollars 100 (Pounds 68) a night.
A lower tax of 14.25 per cent, plus Dollars 2, applies to rooms costing less
than Dollars 100.
While such weighty surcharges can push a night in one of New York's ritzier
hotels out of the reach of some business travel budgets, the city does offer
several alternatives. There are many moderately priced hotels, and weekend
stays can bring savings.
Among the establishments offering rooms for less than Dollars 100 a night is
one of New York's most chic hotels, the Paramount (tel-ephone 212 764-5500)
at 235 W 46th Street. You can get a single room at the weekend for Dollars
99. Bearing the mark of French designer Philippe Starck, the Paramount
features beds with framed artworks that serve as headboards; cone-shaped,
stainless-steel sinks; and a 24-hour health club. Video recorders are
standard in all rooms, and guests can watch movies from a 1,000-title
library.
If you do not appreciate the Barbizon Hotel's lobby, with its deep blue,
domed ceiling decorated with gold frescoes of the signs of the zodiac, you
are likely to enjoy the room rates. Studios, which include single or double
beds and a TV set, cost Dollars 99 a night. The Barbizon (telephone 212
838-5700) is located at 140 East 63rd Street.
It is hard to beat Dollars 75 a night for lodging in Manhattan. That is the
price of a studio, comprising one big room with a TV, at the Esplanade
Hotel. It is located close to Lincoln Center and Riverside Park at 305 West
End Avenue (telephone 212 874-5000). For Dollars 20 extra, you can have a
suite, which consists of one bedroom with a sitting area, kitchenette and
TV. However, the hotel prefers to rent to guests by the week or month, so
you might not be able to take a room on a nightly basis.
Single rooms at the Wentworth Hotel (telephone 212 719-2300), located in the
jewellery district at 59 West 46th Street, cost from Dollars 75 a night.
Doubles start at Dollars 85. Each of the 195 large rooms features at least
one double bed.
Midway be-tween Rockefeller Centre and the United Nations is the 730-room
Lexington Hotel, at 511 Lexington Avenue (telephone 212 755-4400). Until
April, single and double rooms, which include TVs, begin at Dollars 85 a
night. The hotel offers free admission to its country and western dance
club.
At the Comfort Inn Murray Hill at 42 West 35th Street (telephone 212
947-0200), single and double-room rates start at Dollars 94 and Dollars 99 a
night, respectively. Its 120 rooms feature colour TVs. Don't forget to get
your share of free coffee and Danish pastries that are served each morning.
At 228 W 47th Street, in the Times Square area, the 1,000-room Edison Hotel
(telephone 212 840-5000), with its art-deco lobby, advertises single rooms
starting at Dollars 90 a night and double rooms at Dollars 99. Each room
comes with a colour TV set.

Hisako Takahashi, a former director general of the labour ministry, has been
named as Japan's first female supreme court justice, writes Emiko Terazono.
Takahashi, 66, will become one of the country's 15 supreme court justices
when she succeeds Osamu Mimura, who retires next month. Prime minister
Morihiro Hosokawa is trying to follow President Clinton's initiative to
increase the number of women in key official posts.
Hosokawa had been concerned that although women are currently holding top
legislative and administrative posts, none was held in the judicial branch.
Takako Doi, former leader of the socialist party, has become the first
female speaker of the lower parliamentary house, and there are three female
cabinet ministers.
Takahashi entered the labour ministry in 1953 after graduating from the
University of Tokyo. She left last year after serving as cabinet counsellor
and director general.
The appointment will be formalised at a meeting of the cabinet on January 25
and will take effect on February 9.

FT  17 JAN 94 / People: Schulmeyer returns to the 'fun' world of high-tech
electronics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hans-Dieter Wiedig reckons he has crammed 20 years' work into his 10 years
at the head of Siemens' computer business. The past three, spent trying to
blend the conservative old group's operations with those of the
free-wheeling Nixdorf enterprise, have been especially stressful, writes
Christopher Parkes.
In the past 24 months, Siemens-Nixdorf Informations-systeme (SNI) has booked
losses of almost DM1bn.
But his trials come to an end on October 1, when he surren-ders his post to
55-year-old Gerhard Schulmeyer.
Formerly with Motorola, and now a main board member running the engineering
group ABB's operations in the Americas, Schulmeyer says he believes his new
job will be 'fun'.
That remains to be seen - as does the reaction of the existing management to
the appointment of an outsider. Top jobs in typically conservative German
corporations are traditionally reserved for home-bred talent. But SNI,
preparing to cast off 5,000 more employees and announce another DM300m-plus
loss this year, requires special treatment.
The first signs of group chairman Heinrich von Pierer's resolve to break
with tradition appeared last autumn when he brought in Tandem's Robert
Hoogstraten as SNI marketing director.
Further signs of his determination to plug SNI's profits drain emerged last
week when he announced that he would personally take the chair of the
subsidiary's supervisory board next October when Schulmeyer (who arrives in
July) formally takes over from Wiedig.
The job at hand is to meet von Pierer's self-imposed deadline of 1996 for
the business to reach break-even - and thus a position of relative strength
from which it can negotiate on equal terms with potential partners. Wiedig,
who is to be found a new job within the group, will also take a seat on the
SNI supervisory board - from where he will be able to offer Schulmeyer the
fruits of his '20 years' experience.
Schulmeyer, who has dual German and American nationality, returns to the
line of business he knows best: high-tech electronics.
In the late 1970s he worked for Wega Radio, a Sony subsidiary, before moving
to Motorola, where he worked between 1980 and 1989, latterly as executive
vice president and deputy to the chief executive running Motorola Europe.
He then moved to ABB, based in Stamford, Connecticut, and at the end of the
year went on to the main board.
As chief executive officer of ABB in America he presided over the
integration of two important acquisitions, Combustion Engineering, and the
transmission and distribution businesses of Westinghouse, although his
period at the helm was characterised by what the company terms 'flattish'
earnings.
A restructuring of ABB last October put Schulmeyer in charge of the group's
business throughout the Americas.

<TEXT>
On Wednesday the opulent ballroom of the Hotel Intercontinental in Paris
will be filled to capacity when Yves Saint-Laurent takes his bow at the end
of his latest haute couture collection.
In the old days the Saint-Laurent show provided the glittering finale to
Paris couture week as befits one of the world's most famous designers and
the patron saint of French fashion. But couture is not what it used to be.
The collections have become publicity stunts for the scents and sunglasses
that bear the designers' names. The organisation of the shows is now so
chaotic that, to the fury of the French, Saint-Laurent has been
unceremoniously usurped from the final slot by Valentino, an interloping
Italian.
Yves Saint-Laurent, 57, has probably not even noticed. After the show he
will be whisked away behind the bullet-proof windows of his limousine back
to the tranquility of his 18th century townhouse on rue de Babylone in
Paris.
He lives there as a recluse with a few faithful servants, his posse of
bodyguards and his treasures: the Matisses in the library, the Edward
Burne-Jones tapestry in the salon and the Andy Warhol portraits of Moujik,
his beloved dog.
For years members of the Paris social scene have spun sad stories about
Saint-Laurent's illnesses and addictions, his problems with drink and drugs.
But the rumours have died down in the past year. He has dried out, lost
weight and now looks much healthier.
In any other country Saint-Laurent's traumas might make him prey to scandal
or ridicule, but in France they simply add to his stature. He is, after all,
an icon in fashion, an industry that is not only economically important to
the French but cherished as part of their heritage. His vulnerability, his
eccentricities, even his troubled mental history conform completely with the
Gallic cliche of the tortured genius traumatised by his own talent.
Saint-Laurent says that his problems started at school. He led a sheltered
childhood in Algeria, then a French colony, as the adored only son of
Charles, a wealthy business man, and his glamorous wife, Lucienne. But
school was hell. 'Perhaps I didn't have what it took to be a boy,' he once
said. 'I didn't conform. My homosexuality was obvious. They hit me or locked
me in the toilets. It was psychological torture.'
He escaped to Paris at 17 when he won first prize in a fashion contest. Karl
Lagerfeld, the son of a German condensed milk magnate who is now his
arch-rival as chief designer of Chanel, came second. Saint-Laurent then
spent three months at fashion school before being hired as an assistant by
Christian Dior, the grand old man of French fashion. Dior died suddenly in
1957 and Yves, still only 21, was catapulted into the most prestigious
position in Paris fashion. His first collection was a triumph.
'Saint-Laurent has saved France', was the headline in Le Figaro.
Disaster struck three years later when Marcel Boussac, the machiavellian
owner of Dior, loathed one of Saint-Laurent's collections so much that he
allegedly 'arranged' for him to be conscripted into the army. Military life
was just like school. Saint-Laurent had a nervous breakdown and was admitted
to the mental illness ward of a military hospital. He stayed there for three
months until he was rescued by Pierre Berge, a young art dealer who had
fallen in love with him at a Paris party.
Berge then sued Dior, which had replaced Saint-Laurent with another
designer, Marc Bohan, for breach of contract and used the FFr40,000 damages
to begin their own business. Saint-Laurent went on to dominate 1960s fashion
with a string of innovations from micro-minis to trouser suits. He and Berge
bought the townhouse on rue de Babylone and a sumptuous chateau in Normandy
where they entertained the cream of the jet set.
By the late 1970s Saint-Laurent was the toast of the fashion world and
fabulously rich, thanks to Pierre Berge's business acumen. But Yves found it
increasingly difficult to cope with the stress of the fashion business and
the legacy of his childhood traumas. He retreated into his own world to
wrestle with his depression. He has rarely been seen in public for the past
ten years apart from brief appearances on the catwalk at the end of each
collection. Berge moved out of rue de Babylone in the early 1980s. He now
has his own townhouse on nearby rue de Bonaparte and a new companion, Robert
Merloz, once one of Saint-Laurent's assistants.
Saint-Laurent's days as a fashion innovator are long over. As his neuroses
mounted, his designs became more conventional. Yet his 1960s achievements
have assured his place in the fashion history books and the classic styles
in his 1980s and 1990s collections are much more attractive to the
middle-aged women who actually buy haute couture than the avant garde looks
favoured by the fashion purists.
In the meantime Pierre Berge has moved into the limelight. He entered the
political arena in the 1980s as a confidant of Francois Mitterrand, the
socialist president who, in 1988, made him head of the Opera de Paris. He
also stepped up his business deals, culminating in last year's Dollars 650m
acquisition of Saint-Laurent by a subsidiary of Elf Aquitaine, the state oil
group.
The Elf deal caused a furore because of speculation over Mitterrand's
suspected involvement and payments of Dollars 72m each to Saint-Laurent and
Berge. Berge's fortunes have faltered since the socialists lost power. He
has been ousted from the Opera and the police are investigating allegations
of insider dealing in Saint-Laurent shares on the eve of the Elf
transaction.
The final indignity was last autumn's court case when a group of champagne
companies forced Saint-Laurent to change the name of its new perfume,
Champagne, in France.
Saint-Laurent himself seems in better shape than for years. He talks openly
about the improvement in his health since he conquered his drink and drug
addictions. He has told friends he feels liberated by the sale of the
business.
He still spends most of his time behind the black lacquered doors of rue de
Babylone. But he is often spotted walking his dog and sees more of old
friends such as Catherine Deneuve, the actress, and Loulou de la Falaise,
his vivacious design assistant. He also makes more frequent visits to his
summer house in Marrakesh and his Normandy chateau, where he arrives by
helicopter and is then transported around the grounds in a pony and trap.
Saint-Laurent even made an appearance at a party given last month by Bettina
Graziani, a favourite former model at Dior. Paris-Match approved of his
'tender look, timid smile' and his refusal to drink 'anything other than
orange juice and Coca-Cola'.

FT  17 JAN 94 / People: Prudential picks outsider to fill Jackson's hole
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Next month Bob Saltzman will become the first person from outside the
founding family to be president and chief executive of Jackson National
Life, one of the largest US life insurance companies, writes Alison Smith.
Set up in 1961 as a family firm, Jackson National was acquired in 1986 by
Prudential, the UK's largest life insurer, but the senior management
remained in place. David Pasant, the younger son of the founder, left last
June after 20 years with the company.
Saltzman, 51, was appointed after Mick Newmarch, the Pru's chief executive,
had seen a number of candidates found by a search consultancy.
Newmarch says Saltzman, who spent the past ten years at SunAmerica, one of
Jackson National's rivals, was chosen on the basis of his 30 years'
experience in the industry and because of his success at SunAmerica where he
was executive vice-president.
In the gap before Saltzman was appointed, Jackson National was run by John
Knutson, chief operating officer, who will stay with the company. 'He has
been minding the shop pro tem and dependably, but we were interested in
someone to take responsibility for the whole operation,' Newmarch says.
He was not, he added, disappointed at not being able to appoint a chief
executive from within Jackson National; Pasant was only in his early 40s
when he left, so the succession policy was bound to be different from what
it would have been had the chief executive been older.

FT  17 JAN 94 / Management: Making local heroes international - Percy
Barnevik, president and chief executive of ABB, offers advice on building
multinational teams for a global company / Tips from the top
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PERCY BARNEVIK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Any multinational approach to management has to start from the top. Thus,
ABB's supervisory board of eight includes four nationalities; and its
eight-man executive committee is made up of German, Swedish, Swiss, American
and Danish executives.
At group headquarters some 150 people represent more than 20 nationalities.
The group's 50 global business area managers hail from countries such as
Brazil, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Italy, Norway, Sweden,
Switzerland, the UK and the US.
Every one of them in turn leads a team of local managers, each with
responsibilities for day-to-day operations in a different country. For
instance, a German based in Switzerland with global responsibility for a
business area has among his team local managers in Italy, Germany, Sweden,
the US, Norway, India, Saudi Arabia and the Czech Republic.
As business gets more globalised, the competitive advantages of
multinational teams increase. Any single-nationality corporate culture will
run into problems as soon as it aims to integrate larger operations from
other countries.
In contrast, once the initial hurdles are overcome - which is no easy task
and takes a lot of painstaking effort - multinational teams offer major
benefits. Their combined understanding and insight into global and local
business problems are much deeper. Benchmarking of operational performance
on an international scale becomes routine. Rotation of specialists across
borders to transfer best practices runs into far fewer problems and, for
example, international supply contracts across borders and joint development
projects become the norm.
Multinational teams can make unique use of their complementary skills and
backgrounds. So ABB could exploit Finnish and German experience in dealing
with Russians, longstanding Austrian relationships with Hungarians and
Slovenians, traditional Scandinavian links with the Baltic states and
Poland, when expanding into central and eastern European markets.
Now, with established positions in Poland and the Czech Republic, new team
members from these countries help in building the group's presence further
east.
Similarly, ABB uses Chinese-speaking team members from Singapore, Hong Kong
or Taiwan in developing operations in China, or Brazilians and Argentines in
pursuing its Latin American expansion. An important side-benefit is that we
are able to recruit future global managers from the world.
ABB prides itself on being multi-domestic. The group has deep roots in many
countries, respects national differences and cultures, and aims to achieve a
strong local identity in each of its many home markets.
At the same time, we strive to develop a global corporate culture for all
members of our multi-national teams. One key element is having a common
language. English was chosen at the outset, although a minority of the
present 218,000 employees have English as their mother language.
Today, all executives use English as their common language and ABB's
currency for global reporting and consolidation is the US dollar. Most
importantly, from the very beginning ABB established a common set of values,
policies and operational guidelines to safeguard and promote a group-wide
umbrella culture.
Multinational teams do not happen naturally - on the contrary, the human
inclination is to stick to its own kind. If in selecting a manager the
choice is between a compatriot with a familiar background, and a foreigner
whose credentials appear strange and whose language is difficult to
understand, objective criteria tend to lose out.
Competence is the key selection criterion, not passport. Therefore, it is
occasionally necessary to interfere in the selection process, to force
people to overcome the 'foreigner' hurdle and safeguard the ideal of
multinational teams. The value derived from the combined different
backgrounds makes it well worth taking some risks.
Few people have by natural instinct the ability to work well within such
teams. It takes patience, understanding and ability to communicate. One
important route to developing effective team members is to transfer
employees to other countries.
I am not thinking so much of young people who spend six to 12 months abroad
as part of their training and development, nor of the hundreds of people
from newly acquired companies in former Comecon or Asian countries, who
every year learn about modern company operations and get introduced to ABB's
values and policies in western Europe and North America.
What I have primarily in mind is young western Europeans being transferred
to Asia or America, and North Americans being assigned to Europe, Asia or
Latin America. When after some years they return home, they have got a
deeper insight into different cultures, and may even have picked up another
language. They will have learned that their own culture is not always the
measure for all things.
While such transfers on a massive scale may be costly, they are important
for the development of effective multinational team members and global
managers.
The common denominators in these efforts are communication, understanding
and patience. There is no question that the price to pay for a high degree
of 'multi-nationality' is a major investment in two-way communication and
consensus building across borders. Even after making full use of technical
means of communication, a significant amount of time must still be invested
throughout the organisation in face-to-face meetings and team work.
In the final analysis, openness, trust and respect are the key words in all
this. At the end of the day, all people are 'local' with their roots in some
home country. It therefore takes a major, systematic and sustained effort to
bridge the borders, build the multinational teams and thereby create a truly
international organisation. But it is well worthwhile.
Next Monday: Tom Farmer of Kwik-Fit on how to build an honest culture.

FT  17 JAN 94 / Management: Poacher turned TV star - Do headhunters deserve
their BBC image
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Simon Hall puts down his glass of champagne and frowns. Uneasy at the length
of time his visitor has spent in the Gents, he sets off to find him. Hall
opens the lavatory door and recoils in horror. The visitor, the senior
partner at Dunwoody Standish, is lying on the floor in a pool of blood with
both wrists cut.
Last night's episode of Headhunters, a new BBC drama, does not present the
trade in its most flattering light. Hall works for one of London's foremost
headhunting firms, where he spends his time on the mobile phone in constant
search of bodies to 'poach'. A client wants to hire an entertainment lawyer:
Hall does better by persuading him to poach a whole team. When the head of
the old law firm finds out that his valuable assets are about to leave he is
so upset he kills himself.
Headhunters have never been the most respected profession, but the message
from the BBC seems to be that their ruthless tactics are pushing them to new
depths of unpopularity.
Tim Clark, an expert on headhunters at the Open University, argues that the
business does not deserve a bad name. He says that from the beginning people
have viewed headhunting as a secretive, underhand business, disliking the
process by which individuals are approached discreetly and persuaded to move
jobs. 'It's an easy industry to pick on. So much of the business is
confidential. People don't know the full facts.'
So what are the facts? Is there a moral problem with poaching? Might it be
the responsibility of the headhunter to think about the mess that a person
leaves behind when they change jobs?
'The work is very sensitive,' says Ian Butcher of Whitehead Mann. 'You can
create problems if you take out key people. But most senior businessmen
recognise that that is part of the game. In any case, our loyalty is to the
client.'
Far from feeling on the defensive, headhunters view what they are doing with
an almost missionary zeal. Paul Buchanan-Barrow of Korn/Ferry says he is
'helping clients to make the best use of really excellent people, and
helping people use their full potential'.
Miles Broadbent of Norman Broadbent agrees that 'a successful headhunter
provides an opportunity for someone capable of being a chief executive to
become one'. He lists successful British managers including Sir Colin
Marshall at British Airways and Michael Harris at Mercury as among those
headhunted into their jobs with great effect.
The business was not always thus. Headhunting was unheard of in Britain
until 1961 when Peter Brooke, a young aristocrat who is now a government
minister, set up a British office for the US firm Spencer Stuart.
Three decades later the UK executive recruitment market - which includes
both search (headhunting) and selection (advertising) - is worth about
Pounds 500m a year. These days most companies use headhunters to fill any
post that carries a salary of more than Pounds 70,000. Eton College, the
England football team, the government and the Royal Family use headhunters.
Even headhunters use headhunters.
Although the business has taken a knock during the recession, growth is
forecast. Korn/Ferry boasts that its business is already running at 30 to 40
per cent above the levels of a year ago.
The business has grown partly because senior employees no longer feel
unshakeable loyalty to their employers. Yet most do not reply to
advertisements, partly because they have no time to comb through them, and
partly because they are nervous about being found out.
But even if headhunters add vital oil to the system, it might be argued that
they are overpaid for what they do. Top headhunters earn Pounds 250,000 or
more a year, while a middling one might be on a basic salary of Pounds
60,000 to Pounds 70,000 with a bonus worth the same again.
Their charges to clients are correspondingly high: a fee on success might be
between 25 and 40 per cent of the first year's salary. According to Clark,
the largest fee earned on a single appointment in the UK is Pounds 700,000.
Hardly surprisingly, headhunters themselves - most of whom are mid-career,
and sometimes have impressive CVs of their own - think they deserve their
heavy pay packets. Broadbent compares using a headhunter with using a
solicitor to do conveyancing. 'You want to make sure it is properly done,'
he says.
A good headhunter must be able to understand exactly what the client wants,
and reason with them if the brief is unrealistic. Broadbent has a database
of 8,000 to 10,000 possible candidates, and says: 'It is our job to know who
is potentially movable.' For any given appointment he might start with a
list of 50 to 100 names, which he would pare down between four and six to
present to the client. 'We get paid the fee for saving them time chasing
around,' he says.
Kim Owen-Browne, who runs his own headhunting company, explains that getting
the right people involves careful work. He says it is essential to get to
know the candidate, which means talking to people who have been their
bosses, their peers and who have worked for them.
This endless sifting through CVs and interviews makes headhunting a strange
job, not as glamorous as is sometimes thought. According to Buchanan-Barrow,
the endless wining and dining of possible candidates is a fiction: he is
more likely to be having early morning assignations with people at faceless
hotels on the M25 than lunching at the Ritz.
Even though headhunters collectively might not command the greatest respect,
individual headhunters tend to find themselves popular wherever they go.
'Nobody puts the phone down on them. Not even the prime minister or chairmen
of big companies. That was what I found so fascinating,' says Bill Bryden,
executive producer of the BBC series.
The synopsis for the rest of his television series tells of a mid-life
crisis and an escape by Hall to the country in search for his spiritual
self. Headhunters may view the next instalments with detachment. They think
they have found their spiritual selves already.

FT  17 JAN 94 / MPs to probe aid offer and arms sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Commons public accounts committee will today investigate a controversial
deal signed by the government in the late 1980s to construct a power station
on Malaysia's Pergau river.
It will investigate why ministers overruled advice from civil servants and
spent Pounds 234m helping to build a 600MW hydro-electric power station.
The aid package was the largest amount ever spent by the government on a
single overseas development project.
Last October the National Audit Office, the public-spending watchdog,
reported that the 'the economic viability of the project . . . was marginal'
and that it was 'a very bad buy'. It also revealed that ministers had
overruled the advice of Sir Timothy Lankester, the permanent secretary at
the Overseas Development Agency, who had advised against supporting the
project.
MPs will today question Sir Timothy about why he advised ministers not to
agree to the deal.
In particular, some MPs have expressed concern that the aid project might
have been linked to a sale of military equipment to the Malaysian
government, which would have been illegal.
At roughly the same time as the aid package was agreed, the Malaysian
government agreed to buy Pounds 1bn worth of Tornado jet fighters and other
military equipment from the UK. Under the 1966 Overseas Aid Act, it is
illegal for ministers to use aid as a means of securing defence sales.
In July 1988 Mr George (now Lord) Younger, then defence secretary, sent a
memorandum to the Malaysian government emphasising that there was no linkage
between the arms deal and the offer of aid.
The Foreign Office has also repeatedly denied that there was any link
between the two deals.
It is understood though that, prior to the memorandum, documents were
exchanged by the the British and Malaysian authorities linking the arms deal
with a general offer of aid.
Committee members doubt that they they will be able to question Sir Timothy
today on whether there was any link between the deals. Its rules allow
members to ask questions requiring a factual response, but they cannot ask
ministers or permanent civil servants about broad policy issues.

FT  17 JAN 94 / Taiwanese offer hope to west Belfast: A floppy disk factory
may help bring revival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the next two months the government is expected to announce that a deal
has been reached with the Taiwanese company CIS Technology to establish a
floppy disk plant on the fringes of west Belfast.
The Pounds 13m-Pounds 14m venture will be the one of the largest foreign
investments in manufacturing in this republican stronghold since the
ill-fated De Lorean car factory in the late 1970s.
This unhappy comparison indicates how difficult it has been to attract
inward investment to the impoverished north and west of the city - the
epicentre of 'the troubles' - during the past 25 years.
It is inward investment in manufacturing that by and large has been the
missing ingredient in efforts by successive governments, and others, to
regenerate this densely populated inner-city area. Much of the once rotting
housing stock has been repaired or replaced in both predominantly Roman
Catholic and predominantly Protestant areas. Some impressive civic amenities
have been built. Bustling industrial estates have even sprung up, housing
small local companies in fields as diverse as silicon chips and beansprouts.
But prospective large-scale investors in manufacturing and industry have
generally stayed away, with the result that the employment problem spawned
by recession and the shrinkage or closure of traditional industries has
persisted.
According to the Phoenix West Belfast Development Trust - whose territory
includes the mainly Protestant Crumlin Road and Shankill Road, as well as
the mainly Catholic Falls Road - the area has an average unemployment rate
of 36.7 per cent 'rising to more than 60 per cent in some . . .
neighbourhoods'.
The looming hulks of disused linen mills - and the vacant lot behind the
Falls Road where a big bread plant used to be - symbolise the plight of an
area where the siege mentality generated by quarter of a century of
terrorism makes it harder for people to get on their bikes and look for work
than elsewhere in the country.
Seen in this context, the 200 or so jobs that the new floppy disk plant
should eventually create are the most significant sign yet that renewed
efforts to encourage industrial investment in the most troubled areas of the
city are beginning to bear fruit.
According to Dr Joe Hendron, the SDLP MP for West Belfast, it is a fair bet
that five years ago the Taiwanese company would not even have been shown the
site it is now expected to use.
Another indication of the seriousness of government efforts to revitalise
the area was last month's visit by Mr John Major, the prime minister. Still
another was the recent decision by the Department of Economic Development to
establish a working group aimed at focusing its collective attention on the
region.
Among the working group's initial tasks will be to consider an assessment of
industrial infrastructure to be carried out by the Industrial Development
Board. The group will aim to identify industrial sectors offering a 'fit'
with the area. The IDB is on record as saying that getting inward investment
into north and west Belfast is its number-one priority.
There will be large sums of public money tied up with the CIS project: it
will be in an area that qualifies for government grants of up to 50 per cent
on factory buildings.
But intensifying efforts to regenerate the area could pay significant
political dividends in the wake of the new UK-Irish peace initiative.
Dr Hendron unexpectedly won the West Belfast seat from Mr Gerry Adams, the
Sinn Fein president, by just 600 votes at the last general election in April
1992.
Projects like the floppy disk plant - which will employ many of Mr Hendron's
constituents, although the site is actually in Ulster Unionist leader Mr
James Molyneaux's Lagan Valley seat - will do nothing to harm the SDLP MP's
prospects of re-election.
This could be an important consideration, especially if the IRA declines to
grasp the olive branch it has been offered and end its campaign of violence.
The slums huddled by Black Mountain are a traditional breeding ground for
terrorists - republican and loyalist.
One inspiration is Londonderry, which has attracted more than its share of
inward investment - though unemployment remains high by UK standards. Dr
Hendron says: 'Jobs have been pouring into Derry as a result of the efforts
of John Hume (the SDLP leader). If he can do it for there, I don't see why
we shouldn't for Belfast.'

FT  17 JAN 94 / Relaxation of building society rules proposed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Building societies could save several hundred thousand pounds a year from
streamlining procedures for communicating with their members under plans
from a government advisory body to be presented this week.
The taskforce on de-regulating financial services, one of seven groups set
up by trade and industry secretary Mr Michael Heseltine almost a year ago,
has concluded that there is scope for relaxing some of the requirements on
societies to notify and consult their millions of members.
Recommendations from all the taskforces are due to be published on
Wednesday, together with the de-regulation bill itself.
The financial services taskforce, made up of a small group of people working
in the sector, has proposed that societies should be able to ask their
members whether they still wish to receive individual notification of
arrangements for annual general meetings and copies of summary results.
Society members could also decide to end the system of giving their
individual consent every time a society seeks agreement to engage in a new
financial activity. Instead, members could delegate this function to the
society's board.
The changes could be brought about through orders made under existing
legislation. If ministers approved the plans, they could come into effect
before the new bill had completed its passage through parliament.
Most of the proposed measures for de-regulation in financial services relate
to building societies - which are also expected to benefit from new powers
in the bill itself.
There is some hope in the industry that the powers the government would take
in the new measure to amend primary legislation by statutory orders could be
used to increase the present limit of 40 per cent of funds which societies
can raise on the wholesale markets.
Larger societies want greater access to wholesale funds, where borrowing is
cheaper, in order to offer more attractive deals to potential borrowers. At
present, because the limit is set by the Building Societies Act 1986, a new
bill would be required to alter it.

FT  17 JAN 94 / Tecs warned over role in local economic activity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Training and Enterprise Councils must define more sharply their own role in
local economic development, an employment research centre has warned.
Tecs' work in the economic development of their areas is 'strong in
aspiration but modest in effort', says a report prepared for the Tecs'
national council by Professor Amin Rajan of the Centre for Research in
Employment and Technology in Europe (Create).
The report, published today, calls for action by government and Tecs. Its
findings will be considered at the employer-led bodies' national conference
in July.
Tecs were set up by the government to improve training in England and Wales
as well as to be strategic bodies for local economic development.
Professor Robert Bennett of the London School of Economics last week
published a book that highlighted the organisations' lack of progress in a
number of areas, including playing a role in local economic development. He
called for a number of institutional changes, including the merging of Tecs
with chambers of commerce.
The Create report is neither as prescriptive nor as ambitious. But it calls
for an acceleration of Tecs' activities, including the establishing of
viable partnerships with other local bodies.
The report urges tax relief for companies participating in the Investors in
People programme, which seeks to link the training and development of
employees more effectively to their companies' business needs. The scheme is
the Tecs' main programme for improving training of people in work.

Lloyd's of London, the insurance market, is facing a Dollars 20m claim

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Treasury has voiced its concern to Railtrack over the salaries it is
proposing to pay some directors.
Its interest was sparked by a proposal by Railtrack, which is to run the
rail infrastructure from April, to pay a seconded civil servant a
significantly higher salary.
The Treasury has set Railtrack's initial rate of return at 5 per cent in
1994-95, rising by 1 percentage point a year until it reaches 8 per cent.
This was done on the understanding that Railtrack would be able to meet the
higher return over the three years by cutting its costs instead of
increasing its charges.

Work on the pipeline is expected to start next year.
British Gas has formed a strategic alliance with Tenneco Gas, a US company,

FT  17 JAN 94 / Unions criticise job-saving deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sheffield City Council hopes to repeat last year's model job-saving deal
which involved a small cut in pay for its 15,000 employees in return for job
security and an extra seven days' holiday. But union officials warn that the
deal is unlikely to be accepted for a second year.
Compulsory redundancies were avoided last year as a result of the deal,
which cut pay by 3.25 per cent. This year, according to union officials, the
council wants a further cut of 2.75 per cent but is not offering extra
holiday.
The deal produced a saving of Pounds 7m for the council last year. This year
it needs another Pounds 9m saving in employee costs as part of a Pounds 31m
package of cuts.
There was strong support for last year's deal from Nupe, the public-service
union, and Nalgo - now part of Unison - and narrower support from the GMB
general union.
But Unison said yesterday: 'We were persuaded to accept a pay cut . . . on
the basis that it was going to resolve the budget problems and give the
council a year in which to restructure. It seems that we are right back in
that position again and it's all been for nothing.'

FT  17 JAN 94 / Education bill stalled by angry Tory peers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government may be unable to push its education bill through parliament
without substantial revisions because of growing opposition to the measures
in both the Commons and the Lords.
The bill, which would create a teacher-training agency and restrict the use
of student union funds for political activity, was introduced into the Lords
last month. But, according to backbench Conservative MPs, the legislation
came under such intense fire from peers that ministers are uneasy about
moving it to the committee stage where it would be scrutinised clause by
clause.
One Tory MP said the government was moving on to other legislation while it
decides what to do. He said: 'The government did not anticipate that it
would be so severely opposed and it has shaken them a bit.'
The bill was attacked at its second reading debate last month by a number of
Tory peers as an infringement of the rights of student unions. That was
followed by a second challenge from a Lords procedure committee which
complained that the bill had been poorly drafted.
The Lords committee on the scrutiny of delegated powers said that the bill
gave the education secretary almost unlimited powers to decide how student
unions could spend their money. 'The House may regard as inappropriate the
delegation of legislative power to interfere with the freedom of association
of students,' the committee said.
Lord Graham, a Labour whip in the Lords, said no date had been set for the
bill to go its committee stage up to the week beginning February 7. 'A bill
that received its second reading on December 7 should have moved on by now,'
he said. 'The government is clearly concerned by what is going on.'
Department of Education officials believe that the bill is not facing any
real difficulties. 'We are determined to press on,' said one.
But if the bill moves to the Commons in its present form, it would probably
be opposed by two former education ministers, Mr Robert Jackson and Sir
Rhodes Boyson, and by the Conservative chairman of the Commons education
committee, Sir Malcolm Thornton.
Mr Jackson said last week that the proposals to restrict the rights of
student unions were so unjust that they they might infringe the European
Convention on Human Rights.
Sir Rhodes believes that the reform of student union funding was
satisfactorily dealt with by legislation he introduced when he was an
education minister 10 years ago. 'We should really be focusing on more
important issues now,' he said.

FT  17 JAN 94 / Goodwill plan for accounts attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Accounting Standards Board's proposals on goodwill may be complex,
costly and subjective to apply, Touche Ross, the accountancy firm, warns
today.
It calls for intangible assets such as brands in acquired companies to be
shown on the balance sheet, while other goodwill should be charged to a
statement outside the profit and loss account over a long period, such as 40
years.
The firm's views are in a booklet examining the options on the future
accounting treatment of goodwill - the difference between the net assets and
the purchase price of an acquired company.
The board issued proposals in December offering several alternative
approaches.
Touche Ross broadly favours the board's option of allowing goodwill to be
maintained on the balance sheet as long as it meets regular 'ceiling tests'
to ensure it has held its value.
But it warns that the test is not in line with the approach taken by
international accounting standards; that there will be problems in applying
it once acquired businesses have been integrated with existing ones; and
that the amounts of goodwill written down will be substantial at a time a
company may be least able to bear the loss.

FT  17 JAN 94 / CBI says steelmakers must be even more competitive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Productivity in the UK steel industry is more than 10 per cent above the
European average, but steelmakers must become even more competitive, says a
report today by the Confederation of British Industry.
The industry is performing as well as any in the world, and its success in
improving competitiveness should be applauded, says Mr Duncan McKenzie,
senior economist with the CBI's National Manufacturing Council.
New markets in the AsiaPacific region, China, the Indian sub-continent and
Latin America mean the outlook for an increasingly efficient UK steel
industry is positive.
But the combination of sluggish, recession-hit European markets, which
account for nearly two-thirds of UK exports, and the threat of increased
competition from eastern Europe and the US meant that the UK industry 'can
take nothing for granted'.
The CBI report, produced in consultation with the British Iron and Steel
Producers Association, highlights how the steel industry has turned itself
round in the past 10 years.
Mr McKenzie says exports have risen from Pounds 992m in 1981 to Pounds
2.77bn in 1992, with the trade surplus rising from Pounds 412m to Pounds
1.76bn.
Continuous casting, widely seen as an indicator of world-class performance,
provided 87 per cent of total UK steel production in 1990, compared with
only 32 per cent in 1981, and well ahead of the world average of 70 per
cent.

FT  17 JAN 94 / Whistleblowers spotlight fraud at work
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Corruption and financial malpractice in the workplace were the most common
concerns of workers who contacted a charity set up to give legal advice to
employees.
The first report of Public Concern at Work, the charity that advises
so-called 'whistleblowers' - people who expose malpractice in the workplace
 -is published today. It says that a third of the calls the charity dealt
with in its first month of operation concerned corruption and potential
fraud.
It also found that the National Health Service was the largest single source
of complaints.
In one case support staff at a trust hospital - not named in the report
because of the charity's duty of confidentiality - raised worries about a
doctor who they said intimidated nursing staff and colleagues. They also
alleged that his patients had a significantly higher mortality rate than
those of his colleagues.
The charity advised a union official to raise the problem informally with
the hospital's chief executive. The result was that the working atmosphere
improved and the doctor's medical performance was being monitored.
Mr Guy Dehn, director of the charity, said the hierarchical nature of the
NHS meant 'the idea that nurses, blue-collar or clerical staff could even
politely suggest that the surgeon is chopping off the wrong leg is unheard
of'.
Of some 200 calls received by the charity in the first month, a quarter
involved people with serious workplace concerns. Others wanted information
on the legal service or had private grievances not covered under the
charity's remit, which insists on a public-interest element in the concern.
The report said 25 out of 51 people who had blown the whistle on their
employers before contacting the charity had been victimised for speaking
out, and 17 had been either sacked or forced to resign.
It added that people at all levels, including directors, senior managers and
consultants, had sought advice. Concerns included unsafe buses, mail-order
fraud, suspected tendering fraud in local authorities, abuse of children in
care, dubious methods in financial services and drugs misuse at work.
The charity said that its advice in one case prevented the award of a Pounds
750,000 freight contract to a company which had been running unsafe
vehicles. The safety inspector for the customer company ignoring his worries
about the vehicles' roadworthiness and suspected he was receiving bribes
from the contractor.
The inspector was advised to raise his fears discreetly with the company
finance director. This led to the contract being awarded elsewhere, but the
suspect manager was still in post and the inspector was considering leaving
his job.

FT  17 JAN 94 / NHS cleaners covered by Tupe transfer rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The contracting-out of National Health Service cleaning work to private
companies is covered by the European Union's transfer regulations, which
protect the pay and conditions of workers for at least one year, according
to a Liverpool industrial tribunal.
Following an Employment Appeals Tribunal ruling last year it had been
assumed that the Transfer of Undertakings - Protection of Employment (Tupe)
regulations - which often make public sector contracts less attractive to
the private sector, would not generally apply to NHS cleaning.
In September Mr Justice Wood upheld an industrial tribunal judgment that
Tupe did not apply when 107 cleaners at Orsett Hospital in Basildon were
transferred from Initial Health Care Services to the Pall Mall Services
Group.
But the latest judgment has ruled that the contracting out of cleaning at
Walton Hospital to Taylorplan Services in October 1992 is covered by Tupe.
However, the two decisions are not necessarily in conflict as the Orsett
case involved a transfer between two private groups.
The significance of the decision is that it has established that an in-house
cleaning operation, which had won the original tender to clean the hospital
from 1986 to 1992, can be regarded as a separate 'undertaking', at least in
an NHS trust, and a transfer can be deemed to have occurred in spite of the
minimal transfer of equipment and premises.
Unison, the public-service union, welcomed the decision on behalf of the 120
cleaners who will qualify for some compensation for the lower pay and
sickness benefit they have received from Taylorplan. Some of the 25 people
who were not taken on by Taylorplan may also be able to claim unfair
dismissal.

FT  17 JAN 94 / PM to be pressed on accountability: Scott to probe
ministerial knowledge of departments' organisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The question of ministerial accountability - what was known and if it was
not, why not - could prove the biggest test for Mr John Major when he
appears before the Scott arms-for-Iraq inquiry today.
The prime minister is reported to be 'entirely convinced' that the mass of
Whitehall documents covering the period under investigation by Lord Justice
Scott confirm his complete innocence of any misconduct.
But today's public hearing will range wider than the precise details of
Whitehall decision-making.
According to inquiry officials, Lord Justice Scott wants to press Mr Major
on whether he subscribes to a set of guidance notes on ministerial
accountability that the judge has been using as a working tool to test the
evidence of previous witnesses.
The judge has taken a keen interest in existing procedures for ministers
which were set out by the head of the civil service in 1988. He is likely to
put to Mr Major the broad premise that accountability concerns not only
accountability in parliament 'after the event' but also requires ministers
to take an active interest in the organisation of their departments,
including the efficient dissemination of intelligence.
The judge is likely to focus initially on Mr Major's short spell as foreign
secretary - July to October 1989.
This period coincided with an inter-departmental row between Mr William
Waldegrave, then foreign minister and in effect Mr Major's number two, and
Mr Alan Clark, then defence minister, and Lord Trefgarne, then trade
minister, over whether export licences should be granted to British
machine-tool manu-facturers such as Matrix-Churchill. Intelligence at the
time showed that machine tools were being used to build up Iraq's military
capability.
Mr Major has told the Commons that as foreign secretary he was not aware of
the row, nor was he briefed on the Matrix-Churchill affair before a meeting
in New York with Mr Tariq Aziz, then Iraqi foreign minister, in September
1989.
The Scott inquiry has heard that the government was clearing export licences
for defence-related goods to Iraq right up to the invasion of Kuwait in
August 1990, when Mr Major had already succeeded Mr Nigel Lawson as
chancellor and thus attended important cabinet meetings.
In January 1991 - two weeks after the Gulf war began - Mr Major, by then
prime minister, told MPs that 'for some considerable time we have not
supplied arms to Iraq'.
Mr Major also told the Commons that ministers who signed public interest
immunity certificates withholding disclosure of documents in the
Matrix-Churchill trial 'were doing what they were obliged to do by law' and
that there was therefore no deliberate cover-up.

FT  17 JAN 94 / Vultures gather over Major: Former supporters within the
Tory party and the press have lost patience
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It does not matter whether John Major uttered the words. It does matter that
his government can be destabilised by what should have been a storm in a
media teacup.
The furore over reports - fiercely denied by Downing Street and unconfirmed
elsewhere - that he had again castigated the Tory right during a private
conversation with journalists guaranteed Mr Major another dismal weekend.
The prime minister's aides blamed a malicious campaign by sections of the
Tory press for the allegations. Nobody who attended the dinner was willing
to admit they had heard the prime minister utter the alleged expletives.
But the details were judged irrelevant by many of Mr Major's colleagues.
Who-said-what stories generally have a limited shelf life.
What worried his friends was that the government was still being buffeted by
events - and that the episode had once again highlighted the prime
minister's weakness in the eyes of the media and many in his own party.
Some once-loyal newspapers - most notably The Sun but also on occasion The
Times and the Daily Mail - make little effort to hide their contempt for Mr
Major.
As his authority wanes, he is finding it harder and harder to re-establish
discipline within the government and the party. Concerted campaigns to
bolster that authority can only be launched so often.
The mood among Tory constituency activists is ugly. Attempts to disentangle
the party conference clarion-call for a return to traditional values from
the personal behaviour of politicians have not gone down well. Many
activists view the government as incompetent, the prime minister as not up
to the job.
The latest row, following hard on the heels of the divisive and debilitating
debate over the 'back-to-basics' programme and the spate of personal and
financial scandals, has exposed once again the tensions between Tory right
and left. Mr Major was the right's chosen successor to Mrs Margaret
Thatcher. Many of those who made that choice have not forgiven him for
turning out to be One of Them rather than One of Us.
Many Tory MPs believe a stronger prime minister - and one with a clearer
ideological vision - would have been able to restore the party's
self-discipline. But for all his personal frustration Mr Major is powerless
to take on his critics while his own personal and political standing is so
low.
It is hardly surprising that many are already positioning themselves for the
possibility of a leadership contest after what they expect to be disastrous
results in this year's local and European elections.
Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, in his deliberately
provocative attack on social liberalism and political correctness on Friday
has reinforced his claim as the natural candidate of the right. Baroness
Thatcher herself is ready to annoint his candidacy (just as she did Mr
Major's).
Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor, and perhaps Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and
industry secretary, would be the centre-left candidates. Mr Clarke would
almost certainly win.
There is though one important person who does not share the sense of
inevitably that some weary Tories have already attached to such a scenario.
Mr Major is not ready to throw in the towel. The one thing that everyone
attending last week's dinner agrees on is that the prime minister made it
absolutely clear that he does not intend to allow the Tory right - or anyone
else - to force him out of office.
He believes he has two years to rescue his premiership. His Thatcherite
enemies will not desire a leadership challenge until Mr Portillo - still
only 40 - is more firmly established.
The prime minister judges that two years of economic recovery will transform
the political scene before the next general election. But surviving the next
six months may be harder than he thinks.

FT  17 JAN 94 / Underwriters enjoy big rise in insurance rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Underwriters who have survived the recessionary shake-out in the London
insurance market are enjoying the best trading conditions for at least five
years.
Rates for most of the lines of aviation, marine, reinsurance and other
commercial insurance, in which both the Lloyd's market and London-based
insurance companies specialise, have risen sharply in the past two to three
years.
This follows a period of intense price competition in the late 1980s and a
string of heavy losses.
During the past six months capacity shortages - which made it difficult for
brokers to place business - have eased, partially because of the successful
introduction of corporate money to Lloyd's.
Institutional and retail investors provided more than Pounds 800m in
capital, helping Lloyd's to increase its capacity this year from Pounds
8.7bn to at least Pounds 10.5bn.
After suffering losses of more than Pounds 6bn in the past five years,
Lloyd's underwriters are expecting to post handsome profits for last year,
when accounts are finalised in two years' time in line with the market's
three-year accounting system.
Investors have also been attracted by improvements in efficiency and hopes
that moves to contain billions of pounds in liabilities from US claims -
mostly stemming from asbestosis and pollution awards - will be success-ful.
The biggest worry is that the recovery, especially in the high-risk
catastrophe reinsurance market, may have been too quick.
Competition, particularly from new Bermuda-based companies, could soon lead
to price-cutting.
Prices are expected to fall by up to 15 per cent in the next six months,
when many of the biggest Australasian and Japanese insurers renegotiate
their reinsurance policies.

FT  17 JAN 94 / Six-month boom for cellphone services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cellular telephones form the strongest area of growth in City
telecommunications but demand for all types of services is advancing, with
competition among operators tougher than ever.
The last six months has seen a cellular boom. The two leading mobile
telephone operators, Vodafone and Cellnet, more than 120,000 net new
connections in December, easily the highest monthly total ever.
About one-in-four of all cellular phones are used inside the M25, and a high
proportion by City workers. One-2-One, the new network launched by Mercury
in September inside the M25, has further boosted City sales.
British Telecommunications and Mercury, the main fixed-line
telecommunications operators, both report sustained growth in phone usage on
the back of buoyant business demand.
Mercury, estimated to have about two-thirds of the City's outgoing
long-distance traffic, reported in the autumn that there had been a 30 per
cent increase in call traffic on the previous year.
Sharp competition between BT and Mercury is stimulating demand. But Mercury
in turn faces competition in the City from two new operators: City of London
Telecommunications, which is digging up the City streets to build its
network; and Energis, a new long-distance carrier, which plans to offer
direct connections to City institutions.
Computer sales companies are also reporting a sharp upturn.
City demand is being strengthened by the arrival of a computer 'superstore'.
Specialist Computer Holdings, the private company pioneering computer
superstores, opened one of its 'Byte' stores in the City's Chiswell Street
late last year.
Mr Neil Cox, SCH marketing manager, said there had been a 'quick build-up'
of corporate customers.
He added: 'All our outlets have seen increased volume but there is pressure
on margins throughout the industry.'

FT  17 JAN 94 / Eurotunnel faces Pounds 1bn legal action
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British and French construction companies have presented their final bill
for building the Channel tunnel by starting legal action to recover more
than Pounds 1bn which they say they are still owed.
The contractors are claiming Pounds 2.6bn for installing mechanical and
electrical equipment. The original amount agreed for this work was Pounds
630m at 1985 prices. The contractors say Pounds 1.5bn of the sum they are
owed has already been paid.
The timing of the claim may embarrass Eurotunnel, the project's operator,
which is expected to make a Pounds 500m rights issue soon as part of a
Pounds 1bn fund-raising move. Details of the contractors' demands will have
to be disclosed in any rights issue document unless it can be settled
beforehand. Construction companies say the size of the claim is likely to
surprise prospective underwriters.
Transmanche Link, a consortium of five British and five French construction
companies, officially handed over the project to Eurotunnel on December 10.
The builders agreed to complete the tunnel, which has been dogged by
persistent rows between Eurotunnel and the contractors, only after
Eurotunnel made an additional payment last summer of Pounds 235m. Eurotunnel
has said that money would have to be repaid with interest if contractors
could not substantiate outstanding claims.
The cost of constructing the tunnel, including interest payments, has risen
from an estimated Pounds 4.8bn in 1987 to more than Pounds 10bn.
The builders say delays by Eurotunnel in agreeing last summer's interim
settlement with contractors had added a further Pounds 500m to the cost.
Eurotunnel has strongly disputed the claims. Negotiations between the
construction companies and Eurotunnel are expected to begin shortly in a bid
to resolve the issue.

FT  17 JAN 94 / City buoyed by 20% fall in empty office space: Commercial
property vacancy rate drops to 15.5% - Bishopsgate bomb prompts four large
moves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER and ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The amount of empty office space in the City of London fell by nearly a
fifth last year, providing further evidence that the property market in the
Square Mile is beginning to recover from one of its deepest recessions.
Office vacancy rates in the City dropped over the year from a record 19 per
cent to 15.5 per cent, says Jones Lang Wootton, the chartered surveyor.
The revival in the property market has been underlined by a sudden and
largely unexpected upturn in commercial property activity for leading City
law firms. Lawyers report more confidence among building owners, with a
definite swing in landlords' favour in the market for new buildings.
The recovery has not yet produced a return to realistic rents but lawyers
say deals on offer to tenants six months ago are no longer available.
The recovery reflects a revival in demand from tenants, together with the
impact of the IRA bomb in Bishopsgate last April and the withdrawal of
poor-quality buildings from the letting market.
Take-up of City offices rose by nearly 25 per cent over the year to about 4m
sq ft, with banks and professional service firms accounting for more than
half of this. Potential and active demand from tenants now stands at 5.2m sq
ft, Jones Lang Wootton says.
Confidence that the market is set for recovery is tempered by an awareness
that some of the factors stimulating last year's reduction in vacancy rates
may not be repeated.
Four of the City's 10 largest property moves last year resulted from the
Bishopsgate bombing. It prompted office moves by solicitors Norton Rose,
insurance brokers Willis Caroon, and the Long Term Credit Bank of Japan. In
addition National Westminster Bank is to lease the Billingsgate building by
the river Thames as a back-up in case of disaster.
Savills, the chartered surveyor, says that in total the bomb stimulated the
take-up of 600,000 sq ft of space and the withdrawal from the market of
500,000 sq ft of damaged offices.
The recovery of the City office market is also constrained by the
difficulties that many tenants wanting to move offices encounter in
disposing of their existing lease obligations. Many tenants are locked into
paying rent at well above market levels and cannot pass their leases on to
new tenants.
Mr Jeffrey Bailey, a property partner of City solicitors Linklaters &amp;
Paines, says lawyers are convinced that the increase in activity is not a
false dawn. He said: 'With interest rates so low, even without rents moving
you can get a better return from real estate than from other investments.
That's why we are seeing a move into quoted property company shares.'
In spite of the damage done over the past four years to confidence in
property as a safe investment, institutions in particular are beginning to
realise that their investment portfolios are out of balance.
The decline in the City office vacancy rate has been most pronounced for
modern office stock. Savills reports that supply dropped by 26 cent last
year and with a vacancy rate of just 5 per cent agents believe this could
result in a shortage of new City offices by 1996. A significant rise in
rental values on prime space during the next 12 to 18 months could stimulate
a return to speculative development, they believe.
Tenants have shown a marked preference for buildings in the core of the City
rather than the fringes, where vacancy rates are an estimated 27 per cent.
The prospects of letting poor-quality office space in fringe locations is so
poor that many buildings have been withdrawn from the market and made
uninhabitable in an effort to avoid incurring rates.

FT  17 JAN 94 / Labour alleges 'vote-rigging' link
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour last night claimed there was 'an unmistakeable trail' leading to
Conservative Central Office over Westminster City Council's alleged 'homes
for votes' policy.
Mr Jack Straw, shadow environment secretary, has written to Mr Peter Brooke,
national heritage secretary; Mr John Gummer, environment secretary; Mr David
Hunt, employment secretary; Sir Norman Fowler,Tory party chairman; and Mr
Kenneth Baker, former party chairman; challenging them to set out what they
knew about the policy.
It was confirmed yesterday that Wandsworth Borough Council, another leading
Tory London council, was under investigation by the district auditor over
aspects of its housing policy.
Sir Paul Beresford, Wandsworth leader from 1983 to 1992 and now Tory MP for
Croydon Central, denied any comparison between the housing policy at
Wandsworth and allegations made against Westminster.
Ten Westminster councillors and officials - including former leader Dame
Shirley Porter - were accused of gerrymandering in the provisional report by
Mr John Magill, district auditor, last week.
In a new twist yesterday, it was claimed that Westminster offered financial
inducements to other councils to take its homeless.
Westminster officials are alleged to have approached councils in the north
of England in an attempt to cut its waiting lists, but apparently they all
refused.
Mr Straw said yesterday: 'The public have a right to know how much of
Shirley Porter's work was with the complicity, connivance and support of
senior national Tories and how far they were simply content to turn a blind
eye or deaf ear to what was going on.'

FT  17 JAN 94 / Accountancy firms voice optimism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Accountancy firms in London are beginning to express cautious optimism about
economic recovery and its impact on their business.
Mr Michael Fowle, senior partner for London and the south-east for KPMG Peat
Marwick, said: 'I think things are beginning to turn up, although we are
lagging comment in the papers.'
Mr Michael Boyd, head of the London office of Ernst &amp; Young, said: 'Overall
it's going to be another tough year, but we will hold our own.'
Most firms have reported almost static fee income in their most recent
results, compared with substantial growth in the late 1980s.
Consulting suffered particularly heavily, while audit and tax work have been
stable against a backdrop of growing competition between the firms.
In the last few months the compensating fillip provided by income from
insolvency work has begun to decline, reflecting the drop in the number of
company failures.
Both KPMG and Ernst &amp; Young said corporate finance and investigations work
were beginning to pick up, in line with the recovery in corporate
transactions and rise in the equity markets.

The Interior Department last week won the agreement of Flo-Sun Inc, one of
the biggest sugar producers, to a clean-up plan that could cost it Dollars
70m-Dollars 100m (Pounds 47m-Pounds 70m) over the next 20 years, reviving a
more extensive agreement in principle reached with the sugar industry last
summer. That deal broke down last month amid disputes between
environmentalists and sugar growers over details.
But Mr Bruce Babbitt, interior secretary, said the Everglades were a test
case for US ability to restore an ecosystem. He promised to press for a

   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Carlos Salinas of Mexico yesterday called for a special session of
the national Congress to give an amnesty to rebel guerrillas who seized
several towns in the southern state of Chiapas on New Year's day.
The amnesty will be extended to all participants in the uprising, and will
cover their illegal acts between January 1 and yesterday.
The president said that there would now be no reason for rebels to remain
away from their villages.
He added that they could carry on with their lives peacefully.
Mr Salinas said he would soon propose an integrated plan for justice in
Chiapas.
The decision followed criticism at home and abroad of the government's
repression of the rebellion, and widespread sympathy for the plight of
indigenous people in the jungles of Chiapas.
A government official said the amnesty would create better conditions for
peaceful solution to the conflict, adding that Congress would be convened
today and that the necessary law would be passed as soon as possible.
On Thursday, Mr Salinas had announced a unilateral cease-fire in the
conflict. He then said he would pardon rebels who had acted out of
desperation or were pressed into the insurrection.
The new amnesty, however, will apply to all participants. It seems to be
unconditional.

FT  17 JAN 94 / Caracas considers rescue for bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOSEPH MANN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CARACAS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A financial crisis at the second largest bank in Venezuela seems to be the
latest manifestation of years of lax banking supervision that has
contributed to past banking failures.
Banco Latino, reporting assets equivalent to Dollars 1.9bn (Pounds 1.27bn)
at mid-year, was suspended from the national cheque clearing system by the
central bank on Thursday. The Caracas-based bank, with branches throughout
Venezuela, is expected to re-open - which it did not on Friday - but there
was no official word on when.
The government, meeting yesterday with representatives of the largest
Venezuelan banks, was considering solutions. These included direct
government intervention (which could lead to a restructuring or
liquidation), a government-backed recovery programme without intervention,
sale of the bank or its closure and liquidation.
The outcome seen as most likely would be the government and the other big
banks providing support so that Banco Latino might recover.
The bank's last published figures, in mid-1993, gave no indication of any
financial trouble. It had total deposits of Dollars 1.56bn, of which 92 per
cent were from the public. In the first half of 1993, the bank had total
revenues of Dollars 382.4m and net earnings of Dollars 10.1m.
Banco Latino, founded in 1950, owns Banco Latino International in the US and
a subsidiary in the Netherlands Antilles. It is the country's leading
financial institution in passbook savings and trust fund management.
It grew rapidly during the second administration of President Carlos Andres
Perez, who took office in 1989 but was ousted last year to face corruption
charges.
The bank was controlled by Mr Pedro Tinoco, a wealthy businessmen and former
finance minister who was a close friend and adviser of Mr Perez. Mr Tinoco,
who died last year, was central bank president from 1989-92. The largest
stockholders are Mr Tinoco's estate, the Febres Cordero family, and the
Cisneros industrial-commercial group which is controlled by two brothers.
The bank's board blames its predicament on outside forces, including a
rumour campaign, an alleged failure by a government entity to pay a debt of
Dollars 75m on time, and a local television station's news of the government
decision to act on the bank. (The news was carried by other media.) The bank
said that it lost more than Dollars 500m in deposits in recent months due to
rumours. Small depositors, however, seem to have been unaware of the bank's
problems until it shut down last week.
The problems will not be fully explained clearly before an independent
analysis of the books. In recent years of high real interest rates, though,
the bank aggressively sought deposits from corporate clients and the general
public, offering among the highest rates in the market.
Last year, Venezuela's economy contracted after three consecutive years of
strong growth, thereby increasing bad debts and reducing income from loans
and investments.
Savings deposits up to the equivalent of Dollars 9,345 are guaranteed by the
Venezuelan government, although past banking collapses have entailed long
delays before depositors were compensated.
After the government had intervened in three banks - Banco Nacional de
Descuento (1978), Banco de los Trabajadores (1982) and Banco de Comercio
(1985) - some clients and creditors never collected, and those responsible
for the banks' failures for the most part went unpunished.
Mrs Ruth de Krivoy, central bank president, has worked hard to tighten the
regulatory system since she took over in 1992, and a new banking law to
correct regulatory and other deficiencies took effect this month. This
allows competition from foreign banks, sets strict capital requirements and
provides regulators with power.
Critics of the Venezuelan banking system, including some bankers, say
questionable practices have been common. The newspaper, El Diario de
Caracas, outlined a few yesterday. They included connivance between bankers,
investors and politicians, sloppy regulation and supervision of banks,
(improper) lending to high bank officials, and betting the government will
provide financial assistance.

FT  17 JAN 94 / China trade threat to UK over Hong Kong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
China increased pressure on Britain at the weekend with a warning that the
continuing dispute over Hong Kong could have a 'crippling effect' on trade.
Remarks by a senior Chinese official seemed designed to draw attention to
the possible costs of the festering Hong Kong issue for British business, at
a time when previously icy Chinese relations with France are returning to
normal. (France announced last week that it would ban further arms sales to
Taiwan. The decision by Paris in 1992 to authorise the sale of 60 Mirage
jets to Taiwan led to a virtual freeze by Beijing on new agreements with
French companies.)
Mr Tong Jiemnin, deputy director-general for Europe at the trade ministry,
told the official China Daily: 'Bilateral economic and trade relations can
hardly escape damage from an unco-operative and unfriendly Britain.'
Western officials in Beijing said that China was using the end of its bitter
dispute with France to highlight possible economic penalties for Britain if
the Hong Kong issue remained unresolved.
The parallel with the French case will cause additional nervousness among
British companies which have been strenuously seeking more business with
China through high-level trade missions, some headed by government
ministers.
The efforts have already secured a substantial increase in Sino-British
trade, though from a low level. British businesses say they have seen so far
no detrimental effects on trade from the dispute over Hong Kong, despite
previous threats from Beijing.
The potential loss of big infrastructural contracts, especially in the power
and energy industries, would be of particular concern to Britain.
Sino-British talks on proposals by Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor, to
broaden democracy in the colony broke down late last year after 17 rounds of
negotiations.
Mr Patten, some of whose proposals are now before Hong Kong's legislative
council, will have talks with Mr John Major, UK prime minister, in London
this week.
On Thursday he will appear before the House of Commons select committee on
foreign affairs.

FT  17 JAN 94 / Electoral reform hanging in the balance / Assessing the
chances of Japan's premier in an upper house parliamentary vote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, Japanese prime minister, faces a daunting task this
week as he struggles to overcome last-minute obstacles to parliamentary
agreement on plans to reform Japan's discredited political and electoral
system.
The outcome of the upper house vote hangs in the balance, a new experience
for Japanese politicians, used to pre-cooking important decisions well in
advance. 'I can't tell what will happen until the very end,' Mr Hosokawa
said on Friday.
Political observers think the seven-party coalition will probably win by a
narrow margin, accelerating the upheaval in national politics which began
with the collapse last summer of the Liberal Democratic party government.
But Mr Hosokawa will have to work overtime to garner the votes needed.
The coalition was aiming for a plenary session vote on Wednesday, the final
stage before the four bills become law. But procedural delays and splits in
its own camp have now forced the coalition tentatively to aim for a vote in
the upper house political reform committee at mid-week, paving the way for a
plenary vote by Friday.
Mr Hosokawa's fortunes have fluctuated almost by the hour during a hectic
past week of political activity. If Mr Hosokawa fails to get agreement by
January 29, the end of the parliamentary session, he is likely to resign and
call a snap general election.
Urgent plans to stimulate the economy are stalled as a helpless finance
ministry waits on the sidelines for parliament to complete its unpredictable
business.
This makes a bewildering change from the days of the LDP, when important
decisions were prepared in an orderly manner, by committee, and parliament
tended not to produce late problems, lamented one official.
The lower house passed the political reform bills by a bigger than expected
margin two months ago, indicating that all was clear for an accord in the
upper house, the final hurdle. In theory, the coalition can count on 131
upper house votes, five more than the 126 needed for a simple majority in
the 151-seat chamber.
But the voting arithmetic is complicated by the growing number of dissidents
on both sides of the house. The coalition's upper house majority is half the
size of that in the lower house, making it all the more vulnerable to
defections.
On the government side, the unity of the Social Democratic party, the
largest coalition member, is shaky, despite a pledge of loyalty to the
coalition from the socialists' convention last week.
Coalition officials believe five or more socialists might cross the floor
and vote against the government, driven by fears that their party will do
even worse under the new electoral system - a mixture of single-seat
constituencies and proportional representation - than under the present,
multi-seat constituency system. Senior coalition officials are working hard
to try to pull the potential socialist rebels and undecided independents
into line.
Until recently, Mr Hosokawa thought he could count on the support of a
little known upper house group, the Niin Club, five populist members led by
a professional comedian, Mr Yukio Aoshima.
That was until late last week, when Mr Aoshima indicated that the club might
side with the opposition, through annoyance at the way in which the
government was trying to steamroller reform through parliament.
Yet the opposition LDP is also divided. LDP members have been instructed to
vote against the bills, reflecting older politicians' fears that reform
spells the end of their comfortable careers.
But the LDP gave its leaders clearance on Friday to negotiate a compromise
with Mr Hosokawa, so the opposition could change its mind at the last
minute. To achieve this, Mr Hosokawa would have to offer compromises that
might offend the Socialists, so the chances are slight.
Even if the LDP does oppose the bills, as it did in the lower house, there
will be defections. An estimated nine LDP upper house members are said to be
ready to vote for the reform bills, which would nearly make up for the
socialist defections and the unexpected opposition from the Niin Club.
When asked to guess the outcome on instinct, political observers point out
that the LDP does not want to damage its already weak popularity by being
seen to destroy political reform, for which Mr Hosokawa has a strong public
mandate.
The LDP's finances are in no shape to fight a quick election. On top of
this, the socialists are keen to retain their first experience of power for
45 years, if only because recent polls indicate they would fare badly in an
election.

FT  17 JAN 94 / IBM wins contract for four Olympic Games
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
International Business Machines, the world's largest information technology
group, has been given sole rights to provide computer systems for the next
four Olympic Games.
An exclusive agreement with the International Olympic Committee was signed
last month, and the two organisations have the option to extend the
agreement for a further two games.
This is the first time the IOC has selected a single company to provide
information technology systems for either the summer or winter Games, which
are held every four years.
The winter games next month, at Lillehammer in Norway, will be the first in
which the winter and summer cycles are separated by two years.
IBM is providing systems for the winter games this year and for those at
Nagano in Japan, in 1998. It will also support the summer games at Atlanta
in the US, in 1996 and those at Sydney in Australia, in 2000. No other
computer company was invited to bid.
It is understood that, although other manufacturers could have provided the
computers, the IOC was persuaded by IBM's world-wide presence, which means
it has an organisation in any country that might host the games.
The committee was also attracted by the idea that systems developed for one
games could be moved easily to the next.
The deal commits IBM to provide for each games, without charge, enough
computer power to run a large company.
IBM is also acting as project manager for the software houses developing
special software for the Games. IBM estimates its involvement will cost it
over NKr100m (Pounds 9.1m).
The US company has lost money heavily for the past two years and is expected
to announce further losses this month. Mr Louis Gerstner, the company's new
chairman, had to approve the Olympic deal.
IBM will have a range of marketing benefits, including world rights to the
Olympic rings and logostyles for use with company promotions. IBM estimates
the value of these from Lillehammer at NKr80m. Because the new deal was
signed after IBM had developed the systems for Lillehammer, the Norwegians
have agreed to pay IBM the difference, or NKr20m.

FT  17 JAN 94 / Everglades clean-up intensified
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US administration is renewing its efforts to make sugar producers help
to restore the Everglades, the spectacular swamp at the southern tip of
Florida.
The Interior Department last week won the agreement of Flo-Sun Inc, one of
the biggest sugar producers, to a clean-up plan that could cost it Dollars
70m-Dollars 100m (Pounds 47m-Pounds 70m) over the next 20 years, reviving a
more extensive agreement in principle reached with the sugar industry last
summer.
That deal broke down last month amid disputes between environmentalists and
sugar growers over details.
But Mr Bruce Babbitt, interior secretary, said the Everglades were a test
case for US ability to restore an ecosystem, He promised to press for a
comprehensive agreement.
Much of the surviving Everglades, one of the world's largest wetlands with
abundant bird and plant life, is protected in a national park but the
fragile ecosystem depends on a steady flow of fresh water.
Drainage and civil engineering have created acres of farmland, mainly
devoted to sugarcane, to the north of the park. This cuts the flow of water
into the Everglades, raises salinity, and pollutes the flow with fertilisers
which have nourished algae and exotic plants, choking native species.
With Flo-Sun now accepting a deal, federal and state government pressure on
US Sugar, the other big grower, will increase.

<TEXT>
The government of former-Soviet Turkmenistan has said that voters in the
Central Asian republic, by endorsing the leadership of Mr Sapurmurat
Niyazov, have granted the president a 10-year term of office, reports Steve
LeVine in Istanbul.
The result of a referendum on Saturday, whose 99.9 per cent margin was
predicted because of Mr Niyazov's tight grip on power, probably reflects
broad support for his plans to convert Turkmenistan's natural gas into
higher living standards for the country's 4m people.
Turkmenistan, like the neighbouring ex-Soviet republics of Azerbaijan and
Kazakhstan, sits on big reserves of largely untapped oil and natural gas. It
is already profiting by initial foreign investment.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
South Africa's radical black Pan-Africanist Congress, blamed by police for
numerous attacks against whites in recent months, said yesterday it was
suspending its armed struggle and had begun telling guerrillas to disarm.
'We announce a unilateral moratorium on the armed struggle,' PAC president
Clarence Makwetu said. This was welcomed by Mr Hernus Kriel, law and order
minister
But it is unclear whether the suspension will lead to a substantial drop in
attacks against whites. Leaders of the movement's armed wing, the Azanian
People's Liberation Army, have been carrying out such attacks without
seeking approval from, or even informing, PAC political leaders.
The new move seemed to pave the way for PAC participation in the election on
April 27. Mr Makwethu said the aim was to show the PAC's 'commitment to
peace, which is essential to ensure free and fair elections'.
An opinion poll in the Johannesburg Sunday Times yesterday showed PAC
support at a negligible 1.7 per cent - below the threshold required to gain
a seat in parliament.
The poll also showed the African National Congress would win nearly
two-thirds of the vote if elections were held now, the second poll in a week
to predict such a large ANC victory. The ANC, with a two-thirds majority in
parliament, would be able to amend clauses of the new constitution without
support from any other party.
The ruling National party had 15.8 per cent in the Sunday Times poll and the
Inkatha Freedom party 5.2 per cent.

FT  17 JAN 94 / International press review
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD, ANDREW HILL and TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA
Russia's press, which is at least half-free, thought the Russian-US summit
less than overwhelming. It was respectful - even the opposition press was
not as rude as it might be in the west - but it did not profess to having
its socks knocked off.
Even Izvestiya, the most loyal to President Boris Yeltsin, headlined its
Saturday report on the two-day visit 'Yeltsin and Clinton basically happy -
but there are problems'. Among them was the readiness, or not, of the
Ukrainian parliament to ratify its government's promises. On past
experience, said Izvestiya, 'we mustn't think that this matter is fully
decided.'
Nezavisimaya Gazeta (The Independent) was characteristically sharper. Tt
said that there was 'nothing special' about the meeting and that 'the
expression of support for the reform course which Boris Yeltsin was adopting
sounded the same as the noises Boris Yeltsin was himself making about
reforms'. The resignation yesterday of Mr Yegor Gaidar from a future cabinet
put these 'noises' in some perspective.
Sovyetskaya Rossiya, the nationalist-communist daily banned since the
suppression of the last Russian parliament until last month, said sourly
that 'the first European journey (of the US president) from Brussels through
Prague, Kiev, Moscow, Minsk and Geneva was in the first place to support and
strengthen his international standing and in the second to demonstrate once
more his support for Boris Yeltsin. The Russian president needs such help
permanently.'
Moskovski Komsomolets, the irreverent Moscow evening daily, concentrated on
Friday on the price of Bill Clinton's suite in the Slavyanskaya Hotel -
Dollars 185 (Pounds 124) a night, it said - against that paid by Michael
Jackson last October in the Metropole (Dollars 1,500 a night). It also noted
that, to avoid disturbance to his few hours of sleep, 'the market around
Kiev Station just outside of the hotel was temporarily closed'. Did the
president know his visit had suppressed market activity?
BELGIUM
Allegations that bribes were promised or paid to Belgium's francophone
Socialist party in 1988, to influence the award of an army helicopter
contract, have whipped the Belgian press into a froth of indignation and
self-righteousness.
The trigger was the December request by Mrs Veronique Ancia, the
investigating magistrate, that the parliamentary immunity of three ministers
be lifted. But what really inflamed the debate was the leak 10 days ago of
her detailed justification of why she wanted to question the trio. That
allowed certain elements of the Flemish press to open up Belgium's old
linguistic divide and rail against alleged corruption at the heart of the
French-speaking political establishment in Wallonia.
Le Soir, the francophone daily, tried to put the debate into perspective on
Saturday - the day after a parliamentary committee voted for a partial
lifting of the immunity of two of the ministers. Certain Flemish
leader-writers had 'discredited the whole of the press' with their
insinuations, said the paper. But it added that the three ministers, all of
whom have denied any wrongdoing, should not have gone public with their own
criticism of Mrs Ancia's report: 'By doing so, they have adopted the same
attitude for which they have criticised the press.'
The lifting of the ministers' immunity was inevitable according to most
newspapers, Flemish and francophone. Flanders' Gazet van Antwerpen said the
public would have considered any other decision tantamount to 'abandoning
the political institutions to the mafia, making hypocrisy a noble virtue and
everyday fraud the rule'. De Standaard, the heavyweight Flemish daily,
stressed in Saturday's editorial - headlined 'To the very core' - that the
investigation was only the start of what should be an in-depth examination
of the financing of political parties and the award of military contracts.
A separate parliamentary committee still has to decide whether to lift the
immunity of the third minister concerned in the affair, but La Derniere
Heure, a popular francophone paper, summed up the current situation with its
banner headline on Saturday: 'Round one to Ancia'.
IRELAND
The lifting last Wednesday of Ireland's broadcasting ban on Sinn Fein, the
political wing of the IRA, has provoked a flurry of comment and analysis in
the Irish newspapers.
'A very wrong decision,' says an editorial and 'A platform for murderers'
shouts a headline in the Irish Independent, the flagship of a flotilla of
newspapers controlled by the Irish millionaire Dr Tony O'Reilly. 'Dublin and
London are now out of step on a very important matter,' the editorial says.
In a more apocalyptic vein in its opinion columns, Dr Conor Cruise O'Brien
(who as communications minister in 1976 introduced the Sinn Fein
broadcasting ban) writes: 'There is a great opportunity here for the
opposition. It is up to them to stop a rot that is beginning to affect the
very foundations of our democratic state.' Nonetheless, the same newspaper
in a poll published on Saturday acknowledges that 64 per cent of the
population agree with the decision to lift the ban and that 57 per cent do
not believe that 'they will be swayed in their views' by Sinn Fein
interviews.
Most papers favour ending the ban. The Sunday Business Post says the ban
came about in the early 1970s 'in the face of British criticism and internal
Fianna Fail feuding. . . the principle of free speech was sacrificed for
internal Fianna Fail purposes'.
Ireland's paper of record, the Irish Times, dedicated several pages to the
issue and concluded that the ban 'served in equal measure to frustrate
broadcasters, embarrass the government and provide Sinn Fein with a sense of
grievance bordering on martyrdom. . . the time for plain speaking and the
putting of strong and straight questions (to Sinn Fein) has arrived'.
Capturing that idea, a cartoon in the same paper portrays a radio
interviewer asking Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein leader: 'What has mass
slaughter and economic mayhem and other aspects of IRA terrorism ever done
to benefit the people of Ireland?' An awkward Mr Adams replies 'No comment'.

FT  17 JAN 94 / Gaidar passes the poisoned chalice: The impact of the
decision by Russia's deputy leader
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Yegor Gaidar's departure from the future Russian cabinet even before he
had been officially asked to join it casts a cloud over the pace of economic
reform and leaves a question mark over the political direction and
composition of the government.
Mr Gaidar, first deputy prime minister, said he could not remain where he
had too little effect on policy, and where key decisions had been made
without his participation or knowledge. He instanced a draft agreement to
reunify the economies of Russia and Belarus, and the spending of Dollars
500m (Pounds 337.8m) on a new parliament building, 10 times more than is
spent to subsidise Russian culture in a year.
He also said: 'I cannot be at one and the same time in the government and in
opposition to it.' This is a reflection of the pressure put on him by his
colleagues in Russia's Choice, the liberal-conservative party which he heads
and which is the largest in the state duma (lower house). In a meeting of
the leadership a week ago it was suggested the party should no longer take
responsibility for government decisions with which it disagreed and which,
many of Mr Gaidar's colleagues think, helped achieve such modest results in
the December elections.
Leading members of the party had also expressed their reservations about Mr
Gaidar continuing to lead it: Mr Andrei Makarov, the prominent lawyer, said
last Thursday that Mr Gaidar should resign from his party post in favour of
Mr Gennady Burbulis, the former aide to President Boris Yeltsin.
Another resignation announced yesterday was that of Mrs Ella Pamfilova,
social security minister and also a member of Russia's Choice. The only
woman in government, she is a prominent liberal but not a cabinet
heavyweight.
Mr Boris Fyodorov, the deputy minister for finance, said yesterday he would
wait until today or tomorrow before deciding on his future. He repeated he
would not serve in government if Mr Viktor Gerashchenko remained chairman of
the central bank and said that he, too, was deeply concerned that the
agreement with Belarus - 'an agreement which effectively means the union of
two countries' - had been agreed in draft without reference either to the
cabinet or parliament.
However, his position is a complex one. He is, as he firmly said, 'not a
member of Gaidar's team' (and is not close to him). He believes he may be
able to get fundamental changes to the Belarus agreement which would make it
acceptable; and he has yet to talk to Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin on
whether he is to be given a place in the government.
One western economist in Moscow said yesterday that 'he could be
Chernomyrdin's last alibi for the west that reforms are continuing,' and it
might be made attractive for him to continue.
Mr Anatoly Chubais, the deputy premier for privatisation, is the only member
of the present government to have been confirmed in the next government. He
has said nothing publicly, but is reported to be prepared to stay at least
until spring, in the hope of advancing his privatisation programme. Mr
Gaidar said he should stay if he could - and added the same for Mr Andrei
Kozyrev, the foreign minister and Russia's Choice member.
The man mentioned openly yesterday as a replacement for Mr Gaidar is Mr
Grigory Yavlinsky, the prominent reform economist and leader of the Yabloko
group in the state duma. Mr Gaidar said that, in conversation with Mr
Chernomyrdin, the latter had raised Mr Yavlinsky as a possible replacement.
Mr Yavlinsky has already been wooed by the president's team, with offers of
ministerial posts and committee chairmanships for him and his party
colleagues - all of which have been refused.
A first deputy premiership is, however, on a different plane and may be
harder to refuse. On the other hand, taking responsibility for an economy
still in crisis may be a poisoned chalice he, too, would prefer to pass.
According to the Interfax news agency citing 'informed sources', Mr
Chernomyrdin has already decided that Mr Oleg Soskovets will continue to be
a first deputy premier with an industrial brief; that Mr Alexander
Zaveryukha will retain his responsibilities for agriculture as a deputy
premier; and that Mr Yuri Yarov, presently a deputy premier with diverse
responsibilities, will retain the title in charge of labour, employment,
education, science and other issues. If he retains these three relatively
centrist and even conservative men, only the post of deputy for the economy
remains open to a reformer.
The implications for reform are not clear.
Western economic observers do not believe that all is completely lost. 'The
peaks are never as high and the lows as low as is often thought in the
west,' said one observer. 'It seems radical reform is out now, and I
wouldn't be surprised by wage and price controls, more protectionism,
attempts to create large industrial amalgamations, directed credits and so
on. But reform is a generation long here. This might prolong the process of
getting there for a year or so'.
However, another said 'this could bring a lot of danger, if all the
reformers leave now or soon. It could mean a reassertion of a strategy of
control which would not work and which would be highly inflationary - and
that could seriously destabilise politics'.

FT  17 JAN 94 / West puts faith in central bank
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Western banks are relying on the Russian central bank to use its
discretionary powers to spare them the worst effects of a presidential
decree reversing the terms of their licences.
Braving uncertainty over the rights of western banks in the wake of the
decree, Citibank on Friday became the first to open a subsidiary in Moscow.
Mr William Rhodes, Citicorp vice-chairman, said the bank planned to ask the
central bank to endorse its decision.
'If there are any doubts, we will check with the central bank,' he said,
confirming that this would include seeking direct permission for operations
curtailed by the decree.
By the end of this year Citibank plans to open another subsidiary in St
Petersburg, the country's second city which has ambitions of taking over
from Moscow as the Russian banking capital.
The presidential decree, issued ahead of last month's parliamentary poll to
appease Russian bankers who fear foreign competition, said that banks which
had received full banking licences but which were more than 50 per cent
western-owned, could not begin to serve Russian residents until January
1996. This, in theory, restricts them to offshore banking functions - such
as those set out in the more limited licence granted to Bank Austria's
Moscow branch.
Last year the central bank gave full banking licences to a dozen western
banks in its bid to attract investment and to improve the performance of its
own banks by exposing them to competition and know-how.
Dr Michael Franz, head of Bank Austria in Moscow, the first western branch
in the Russian capital, vouches for the central bank's ability to assist
western banks. He says the central bank has already used discretionary
powers to allow him to undertake operations not set out in his original
licence. He has, for example, been granted permission to take deposits from
joint ventures, and recent central bank regulations allowing non-residents
to open rouble bank accounts let him conduct operations in roubles, despite
the stipulations of his licence.

<TEXT>
Ukraine's Crimean peninsula yesterday held presidential elections, which
were dominated by issues of nationalism, Reuter reports from Simferopol.
Early returns last night showed Mr Yuri Meshkov, a communist lawyer, to be
well ahead of Mr Nikolai Bagrov, who backs continued Ukrainian jurisdiction
over the autonomous republic and is the only one among the six candidates to
do so.
However, Mr Meshkov, who says Crimea can only prosper if it rejoins Russia,
appeared short of the 50 per cent of the vote required to achieve victory in
the first round.
Ethnic Russians make up about 70 per cent of the 2.5m residents in Crimea,
where a lengthy election campaign has been punctuated by three murders and
allegations of dirty tricks. Crimea was transferred from Russia to Ukraine
as a gift in 1954.
Officials in Kiev, the Ukrainian capital, had hoped that Mr Bagrov, head of
the regional parliament, would pick up late support from people fearing
chaos were a nationalist to win.

FT  17 JAN 94 / Baby Bell sets up telecoms venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US West, one of the US 'Baby Bell' telephone companies, has established a
joint venture to channel up to Dollars 500m (Pounds 337.8m) into upgrading
Russia's telecommunications.
The Russian Telecommunications Development Corporation brings together US
West's existing Russian assets, totalling Dollars 110m, Dollars 40m of
equity commitments from financial investors, and Dollars 85m in debt and
quasi-equity funding from the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, a US
government agency.
The funds, boosted by borrowing and receipts from existing US West
investments, will be used to fund network modernisation and mobile
communications projects in Russia.
AT&amp;T, the US long-distance operator, has Russian investments but US West is
the only one of the seven US 'Baby Bells' making a significant commitment to
Russia.
Its Russian operations include mobile services in St Petersburg and Moscow,
and a 50 per cent stake in a company operating three international gateway
telephone switches.
Analysts estimate it will take Dollars 80bn-Dollars 120bn to bring Russia's
telecoms network up to the level of Spain, which is itself far behind the
most advanced western nations.
According to CIT Research, a London-based consultancy, Russia has about 15
lines per 100 people, less than the Baltic states but significantly more
than Poland and Hungary. Spain has about 35 lines per 100 people.
US West's investment priorities are the '50:50 project' for modernising
Russia's trunk telecommunications network, and an expansion in its number of
cellular licences. It currently has eight licences, and has applied for a
stake in 15 of the 60 likely to be awarded next month.
Seven investors are providing the extra Dollars 40m of initial equity
investment - Baring International Investment, Capital Research
International, Emerging Markets Investors, GT Capital, Invesco CEAM,
Montgomery Asset Management, and Morgan Stanley Asset Management.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Greece's Socialist government has unveiled legislation which is likely to
create 30,000 permanent civil service posts, writes Kerin Hope in Athens.
The draft law, to be presented to parliament later this month, appears to
signal the Socialists' abandonment of an earlier commitment to the European
Union to cut public sector staffing levels.
Permanent jobs for public sector workers employed on contract for at least
six years would swell the civil service by about 8 per cent and further
burden this year's budget.
The Socialist government assured the European Commission earlier this month
that Greece would renew efforts to cut its borrowing requirement, estimated
at 13.9 per cent of gross domestic product in 1993.
The former conservative government's pledge to cut thousands of public
sector jobs under a structural reform programme agreed with the EU was
dropped last summer.
The public sector wage bill soared after the conservatives granted extra pay
rises and made more than 20,000 patronage appointments.

FT  17 JAN 94 / Fiat's job cuts raise spectre of labour unrest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Fiat, the Turin-based automotive group, faces serious labour unrest
following a management decision to implement a 5 per cent cut in its
workforce and lay off a further 10 per cent for up to two years.
The stand-off between the management of Italy's largest private employer and
the unions is expected to set the tone for industrial relations this year.
Italy has been slower than its big international competitors in cutting jobs
in the automotive, chemicals, defence and steel industries - which are most
affected by recession and international overcapacity.
By the end of this week indefinite lay-off notices, lasting two years, will
have gone out to 6,500 of the group's 95,000 workers, with more to follow.
This is in addition to the 16,000 employees who will be temporarily laid-off
this week in Fiat's Italian plants because of poor car sales.
At the weekend Fiat unions called an eight-hour strike for tomorrow at all
big Italian plants. On Wednesday workers at Arese, the big Alfa Romeo plant
outside Milan, which is under threat, are due to strike.
In November Fiat announced plans for job cuts and lay-offs to help it
sustain competitiveness and absorb the impact of recession. During
subsequent meetings - initially with the unions, and then with the Ministry
of Labour - it has held to a tough line.
The unions tried to persuade it to accept 'solidarity contracts' - flexible
working hours and a shorter working week as used by Volkswagen. Fiat
insisted this was incompatible with the L40,000bn (Pounds 15.7bn) being
invested until the end of the century on upgrading production and
introducing new models.
The break came late on Friday evening when Fiat said time had run out and
the plan had to be implemented immediately.
Although reluctant to risk a confrontation, the group's financial position
and car production overcapacity have forced the issue. Fiat's 1993 losses
are likely to be L2,000bn and are largely attributed to poor car sales. With
its Melfi plant fully operational this year, the group's Italian car
capacity will be close to 2.4m units, against 1993 production of little more
than 1.1m units.
The management's decision also appears to have been influenced by the
imminent dissolution of parliament and difficulties of the government acting
as a broker.
The main job cuts are at Fiat's Sevel plant near Naples, in the Turin area
and at Arese. Of these, some 3,800 affect administrative staff.
Apart from trying to introduce 'solidarity contracts', the unions are
concerned that Fiat still lacks a clear strategy and that the two-year
lay-offs will become permanent.
They also fear that in 1996 the Arese plant, employing 9,000, will be
closed.

FT  17 JAN 94 / Paris marchers hail school victory: Protest goes ahead
although education bill is struck down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
In France's biggest demonstration for eight years, an estimated
250,000-300,000 people yesterday marched through central Paris to show their
support for state lay education.
The march had been planned as a protest against the Balladur government's
month-old bill allowing local authorities to increase funding to private,
mainly Catholic schools.
On Thursday, however, the constitutional court struck down the bill, arguing
that inequalities in its implementation would breach the parity required
under the constitution between public and private education.
But yesterday's march still went ahead, though more in the nature of joyful
victory parade than an angry protest, and it drew even more people than
expected by its organisers, who were lay education bodies, teachers and
other trades unions and the Socialist and Communist parties.
Marchers waved laurel branches, symbol of France's secular republic,
brandishing some anti-clerical placards and shouting some anti-Balladur
slogans.
After his biggest setback in nine months of power, the prime minister, Mr
Edouard Balladur, has backed down, deciding not to try to get a revamped
bill past the constitutional court's objections, while calling for a new
dialogue with public education backers.
An opinion poll yesterday showed that the school financing defeat had not
much affected Mr Balladur's own standing, but it had increased that of
President Francois Mitterrand, who openly criticised the government.
The defeat also damaged the reputation of Mr Francois Bayrou, the education
minister, who comes from the UDF coalition party. He was urged to resign by
Mr Patrick Devedjan, a maverick member of Mr Balladur's own RPR Gaullist
party.

FT  17 JAN 94 / Two-speed recovery for Europe as Germany lags
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
France, Spain and Italy will join the UK in economic recovery this year but
Germany will remain mired in recession, according to Oxford Economic
Forecasting, John Griffith writes.
This picture of a two-speed Europe is painted in OEF's latest assessment of
the prospects for the world economy.* It forecasts growth for the OECD
states as a whole of 2.1 per cent this year, compared with 1 per cent in
1993, but stresses the uneven distribution of growth.
It predicts 3.2 per cent GDP increase for the US but warns that this
probably represents a peak, with minor declines to follow up to 1996.
Stagnation is also forecast for Japan, but with a resumption of growth of
2.4 per cent in 1995, accelerating to 3.2 per cent a year later.
The forecasts show the UK continuing to lead the Europeans out of recession,
with growth of 2.7 per cent this year being broadly sustained through to the
end of 1996.
However, it concludes that Italy and Spain are now set to benefit from
increased competitiveness arising from devaluations against the D-Mark.

</HEADLINE>

   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
After one false start and months of confusion, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
Christian Democratic Union has agreed on a credible candidate to become
German president after Mr Richard von Weizsacker steps down this summer.
Mr Roman Herzog, who was nominated at a meeting of the party's national
executive committee on Saturday, is president of the federal constitutional
court in Karlsruhe, the highest legal authority, and a former CDU interior
minister and education minister in Baden-Wurttemberg state.
He seems certain to receive the backing of the Bavaria-based Christian
Social Union, the CDU's sister party, at a meeting today.
Mr Herzog, who is 59, will now face the former Social Democratic party (SPD)
leader Mr Johannes Rau, the popular premier of the state of North
Rhine-Westphalia, in the presidential election, which will be conducted by a
1,324-member electoral college in May. Professor Jens Reich, a founder of
the New Forum democratic movement in east Germany, is the only easterner on
the slate, as a non-party candidate.
Mr Herzog replaces Mr Steffen Heitmann, justice minister of the eastern
state of Saxony, as the CDU candidate. The latter was Mr Kohl's favoured
candidate, as an easterner who could help bridge divisions in a united
Germany, but his conservative views and inexperience instead attracted
criticism and widespread ridicule and he pulled out in November.
Mr Herzog, in contrast, has a wealth of both political and constitutional
experience, as vice-president and then president of the constitutional court
since 1983.
The outcome of the presidential election depends on the attitude of the Free
Democratic party, the junior partner in the Bonn coalition. The FDP has
nominated its own candidate, Mrs Hildegard Hamm-Brucher, who is unlikely to
withdraw before the third round of voting in the electoral college.
The CDU/CSU alliance, with 621 votes in the so-called federal assembly which
elects the president on May 23, needs an extra 41 votes for a majority. The
SPD has 499 votes, and the FDP 114. If the FDP wishes to preserve its
current coalition with the CDU/CSU after next October's general election,
the pressure on the party to back Mr Herzog, and not the popular Mr Rau,
will be enormous.

FT  17 JAN 94 / Big states plan stronger presidencies for EU: Plans to
exploit an 'astral coincidence'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN, IAN DAVIDSON and DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
France, in concert with its three big continental European partners, is
seeking a stronger and more coherent leadership for the European Union
during their successive presidencies in 1994-96, according to Mr Alain
Lamassoure, France's European affairs minister.
The French initiative did not appear to be a bid to establish a big-country
directorate of the EU, nor intended as a slight on the current Greek
presidency, though it may be taken as such. Rather, Mr Lamassoure describes
it as an attempt to exploit the 'astral coincidence' that - starting with
Germany this July, and continuing with France, Spain and Italy into 1996 -
the rotating six-month presidency of the EU will be held by 'four important
countries of the Union which, in addition, share the same conception of
Europe'.
'We have proposed to the Germans, Spanish and Italians that we should
prepare together a common timetable, an agenda over these two years,' Mr
Lamassoure said. This period was likely to see the EU admitting Nordic
countries and Austria, preparing its 1996 constitutional revision and
hosting its conference on European stability as well as dealing with key
neighbours to the east and south and pursuing economic and monetary
convergence.
The joint consultation, evidently still at a very early stage, 'has been
accepted by the Germans and Spanish. . . though we are still waiting for
Italy to have a durable and stable government', he said. But the initiative
meshes with what Mr Lamassoure described as France's growing preoccupation
with the lack of any proper structure to 'prepare, propose and execute' the
EU's common foreign and security policy prescribed by the Maastricht treaty.
'We have 12 (foreign) ministers, but no ministry' to implement their EU
decisions, he said. 'The problem is one of management.' But France was not
prepared to see the foreign policy management role filled primarily by the
European Commission - despite the effort by Mr Hans van den Broek, political
affairs commissioner, to set up a Brussels policy unit  - or by the Council
of Ministers secretariat.
The minister claimed that Britain, with its similar tradition of diplomatic
activism, 'is as preoccupied as we are' with the EU's lack of an efficient
and acceptable foreign policy executive.
Joint Franco-German initiatives were no more acceptable as standard practice
than two of a government's ministers always hatching national policy, he
said.
On general policy, Mr Lamassoure said: 'There is no one to carry out
analysis on behalf of the Twelve, to present proposals before the Council,
and once a decision is taken, no one charged with its implementation.'
The minister admitted the difficulty of implementing Maastricht's foreign
policy as well as its internal justice, police and immigration policies
could have been foreseen, 'but it is only when one moves into action that
one realises the true problems'.
Mr Lamassoure insisted that 'there could no European foreign and security
policy without common defence'. He underscored French hopes that Germany
would soon find the political will and obtain the constitutional freedom to
allow its forces to operate outside the Nato area.
France is evidently concerned the Europeans will not be able to exploit
fully Nato's new willingness to let its assets be used on occasion for
purely European operations - endorsed at last week's alliance summit -
unless Bonn takes a bolder line on defence.
He also went out of his way to stress Paris's common interest with London in
'subsidiarity' - the repeal of unnecessary EU legislation in preference for
national regulation.
In reviewing some 70 EU measures last year, the French and UK governments
were able to agree on a common list of 20 laws for scrapping. Indeed, 'our
approach to the single market is now closer to Britain than to Germany,' he
said.
But the Franco-German relationship remained the key to the overall success
of the EU, said Mr Lamassoure. It had weathered last year's strains over
Gatt, monetary policy and Bosnia - which was just as well, he said, because
if France and Germany were to take different sides on issues, 'there would
be two Europes'.

FT  17 JAN 94 / Big drop in European car sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
West European new car sales fell 15.2 per cent last year to an estimated
11.45m units, as carmakers suffered the steepest annual decline in Europe in
the post-war period.
At least 2m fewer new cars were sold in west Europe in 1993 than a year
earlier. Four of the big six volume carmakers - Volkswagen, Fiat, PSA
Peugeot Citroen and Ford of Europe - suffered heavy losses.
Production has been cut drastically and carmakers have been forced to
eliminate tens of thousands of jobs. The outlook for 1994 remains depressed,
with demand forecast to grow only 1-2 per cent.
New car sales fell last year in 15 of 17 European markets with demand rising
only in the UK and, marginally, in Norway.
Four of the leading volume markets suffered heavy declines with sales
dropping an estimated 19 per cent in Germany, 20 per cent in Italy, 18 per
cent in France and 24 per cent in Spain.
The steepest fall was suffered in the small Greek market with an estimated
year-on-year decline of 28 per cent.
The only significant growth was achieved in the UK, where sales rose 11.6
per cent, as the market began to recover decisively from three years of deep
recession. UK new car sales, however, remain well below the 1989 peak of
2.3m.
In December new car sales in west Europe fell 20.4 per cent year-on-year to
775,000 units, according to industry estimates. The decline was exaggerated,
however, by the high level of new car registrations the previous year, when
sales were boosted by pending increases in car taxation at the beginning of
1993 in several countries. In addition, manufacturers were disposing of cars
not equipped with catalytic converters, which became mandatory last year to
meet EU standards.
New car sales in December were sharply lower year-on-year in all five
leading volume markets, with declines of 31.2 per cent in France, 21.8 per
cent in Germany, 19.8 per cent in Spain, 10.7 per cent in Italy and 7.7 per
cent in the UK.
There were signs of recovery in some of the smaller markets, however,
particularly in the Nordic region, and sales in December were higher than a
year earlier in seven of 17 west European markets.
The Volkswagen group of Germany and the Fiat group of Italy, which both
ended the year deep in loss, suffered the steepest sales declines last year,
while General Motors (Opel/Vauxhall) and Ford both gained market share.
The VW group - including Audi, Seat and Skoda - remained the market leader
in west Europe for the ninth year in succession, but it was hit by an
estimated 20.1 per cent fall in sales volume in west Europe, where it sold
about 320,000 fewer cars than a year earlier.
Fiat, which includes Lancia and Alfa Romeo, saw sales fall 21 per cent to
1.27m units, as its market share contracted to 11.1 per cent.
Rover, the vehicles subsidiary of British Aerospace, achieved the strongest
performance among European carmakers. It increased sales by 9 per cent in a
market that shrank 15 per cent and raised market share to 3.2 per cent, from
2.5 per cent a year earlier.
Japanese carmakers increased their market share to an estimated 12.1 per
cent from 11.8 per cent a year earlier, increasing trade tensions between
Tokyo and Brussels. However, the fortunes of the different manufacturers
varied widely.
Nissan, Toyota, and Honda, which are producing vehicles in Europe, all
out-performed the market and offset reductions in export quotas from Japan
with higher local output. Mazda, the only leading Japanese carmaker without
firm plans for European production, suffered a 28 per cent fall in sales
volume.

FT  17 JAN 94 / Ahtisaari wins first round in Finnish poll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HELSINKI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Martti Ahtisaari, a senior United Nations diplomat, last night won the
first round in Finland's presidential election, but will face a strong
challenge in the final vote on February 6 from Mrs Elizabeth Rehn, the
defence minister, who rode a late surge in popularity to take second place.
If Mrs Rehn's popularity continues to grow at the rate it has increased
recently she will stand a good chance of defeating Mr Ahtisaari in the
run-off vote. His lead was provided by postal voting between January 5 and
11, before her support began to surge; she led among those who voted
yesterday.
Mr Ahtisaari, who led the UN's successful independence operation in Namibia,
won 25.9 per cent of the first round vote, with Mrs Rehn taking 22 per cent.
The two candidates from the main government coalition parties, Mr Paavo
Vayrynen of the Centre party and Mr Raimo Ilaskivi of the Conservative
party, trailed in third and fourth places with 19.5 per cent and 15.2 per
cent respectively.
The most remarkable feature was the success of Mrs Rehn, who three weeks ago
was registering less than 10 per cent in the polls. Impressive television
performances and an unorthodox grassroots campaign caught the imagination of
Finnish voters seeking a new style of leadership after three years of the
country's toughest recession for years.
Both she and Mr Ahtisaari are keen supporters of Finland's application to
join the European Union and project themselves as vigilant protectors of
Finnish security - a key issue because of the political instability in
neighbouring Russia, which previously ruled Finland. But they have markedly
different approaches on the economy, which has shrunk by nearly 15 per cent
since 1990, with unemployment rising to approaching 20 per cent.
Mrs Rehn is likely to attract most right-of-centre voters, while Mr
Ahtisaari advocates more government measures to tackle unemployment.
In the second round, Mr Ahtisaari, with the might of the Social Democratic
party behind him, will have much greater campaign resources than Mrs Rehn.
She is backed by the tiny Swedish Peoples' party and a women's organisation
called The First Lady.
Many Finns may also hesitate to vote for her because she belongs to the
small Swedish-speaking minority, which accounts for just 6 per cent of the
population.
If Mrs Rehn wins she will be the first ethnic Swede to be president since
Marshal Gustav Mannerheim, a hero of Finland's military struggle for
independence from Russia, who held the post in the mid-1940s.

FT  17 JAN 94 / Two-speed Europe foreseen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
France, Spain and Italy will join the UK in economic recovery this year but
Germany will remain mired in recession, according to Oxford Economic
Forecasting.
This picture of a two-speed Europe is painted in OEF's latest assessment of
the prospects for the world economy.* It forecasts growth for the OECD
states as a whole of 2.1 per cent this year, compared with 1 per cent in
1993, but stresses the uneven distribution of growth.
It predicts 3.2 per cent GDP increase for the US but warns that this
probably represents a peak, with minor declines to follow up to 1996.
Stagnation is also forecast for Japan, but with a resumption of growth of
2.4 per cent in 1995, accelerating to 3.2 per cent a year later.
The forecasts show the UK continuing to lead the Europeans out of recession,
with growth of 2.7 per cent this year being broadly sustained through to the
end of 1996.
However, it concludes that Italy and Spain are now set to benefit from
increased competitiveness arising from devaluations against the D-Mark.
Thus after falling 1.4 per cent last year, Italy's GDP is forecast to grow
2.5 per cent this year and 3.6 per cent in 1995. Spain's economy, which
shrank nearly 1 per cent last year, should enjoy a more subdued recovery
this year.
GDP growth of 1.4 per cent is forecast this year for France but it will
trail Italy and Spain to the end of 1996.

FT  17 JAN 94 / Venables deals face further scrutiny
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Further details have emerged of controversial business dealings by Mr Terry
Venables, the former chief executive of Tottenham Hotspur, as the Football
Association struggles to decide whether to make him England manager.
Panorama, the BBC current affairs programme, has obtained a document which
sheds more light on the way Mr Venables raised money to take over the
football club in 1991 with Mr Alan Sugar, the businessman. Doubts over the
source of that finance have been a main reason for the FA's unease.
A decision on the England manager's post may not now be made this week, as
expected.
The document supports an allegation Panorama made in September that Mr
Venables signed away assets of Transatlantic Inns when he was no longer one
of the company's directors.
Speaking publicly about the deal for the first time, Mr Colin Wright, a
director of Transatlantic, said yesterday: 'We were horrified when we
discovered that all of the assets of Transatlantic had been used by Terry
Venables to raise a Pounds 1m loan. None of the directors of the company had
authorised such a transaction. The implications were terrible for us.'
The assets were pledged to a leasing company in August 1991 and leased back.
The Pounds 1m raised went to Mr Venables' private company, and shortly
afterwards he used the cash to pay for his stake in Tottenham Hotspur.
The document sets out part of the 'sale and leaseback' contract with
Landhurst Leasing, a company now in receivership.

FT  17 JAN 94 / Assad vows to seek peace with Israel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS and JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
President Hafez al-Assad of Syria pledged himself yesterday for the first
time in public to a full normalisation of relations with Israel as part of a
comprehensive Middle East peace settlement.
In a rare appearance in the west after long talks in Geneva with President
Bill Clinton, Mr Assad called for a 'peace of the brave' and said he wished
to see stability and security in the region and normal relations between all
states. Syria had made the 'strategic choice' to seek peace with Israel
after years of confrontation.
Mr Assad's call for normal relations could give a significant boost to
negotiations between Syria and Israel, the most important component of an
eventual comprehensive Middle East peace agreement still to fall into place.
Senior US officials said they were greatly encouraged by the words used by
Mr Assad, particularly on relations with Israel. 'These are words that
Israel has long waited to hear,' said one.
Mr Clinton stressed that the outline accord between Israel and the Palestine
Liberation Organisation represented an important first step towards peace.
But he and Mr Assad also emphasised that for any deal to be durable it had
to include the other Arab partners to the process.
'Syria is the key to a comprehensive and enduring peace that will finally
put an end to conflict between Israel and her Arab neighbours,' said Mr
Clinton.
He confirmed that the heads of the Syrian, Lebanese and Jordanian
negotiating teams would be in Washington next week to resume contacts with
Israel and discuss a full resumption of the talks broken off last summer.
Syria has insisted that it would be pointless to resume negotiations without
a prior Israeli commitment to withdraw fully from the Golan Heights,
occupied in 1967. Israel has demanded that Syria should state its
willingness to exchange ambassadors and open its borders to trade and
travellers, before it would say from how much of the Golan it would
withdraw.
Mr Clinton said he was encouraged by the Syrian leader's statement and he
hoped for a positive response from Israel. Speaking aboard Air Force One, as
he returned to Washington last night, he said Mr Assad 'has reached the
conclusion that it is in the interests of his people, his administration and
his legacy to make a meaningful and lasting peace. I believe that.' Mr
Clinton added that his trip to Europe had 'met all of our objectives'.
In Jerusalem, Israeli officials were cautiously positive. Mr Yossi Beilin,
deputy foreign minister, said significant words were spoken at the press
conference, mainly by Mr Clinton. Israel was waiting to hear from a US
delegation last night about what was said behind closed doors.
The two presidents agreed to set up a committee under Mr Warren Christopher,
US secretary of state, and Mr Farouk al-Sharaa, the Syrian foreign minister,
to explore bilateral differences between the two countries.

FT  17 JAN 94 / Treasury may give Pounds 1.5bn for Channel rail link
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is believed to be ready to provide up to Pounds 1.5bn of
public-sector funds for the long-delayed Pounds 3bn Channel tunnel rail
link, it emerged last night.
In a significant policy switch, the Treasury has apparently given its
approval to provide between Pounds 1bn and Pounds 1.5bn, compared with
Pounds 300m to Pounds 500m previously believed to be available.
An announcement on the final route for the 68-mile rail link is due next
week, and the government is understood to be keen to improve the
attractiveness of the project to the private sector.
However, increasing public funds represents a large change in the
government's attitude. The Channel Tunnel Act, which gave the go-ahead for
the tunnel and set the terms for its financing, restricted public funding
for the rail link to investments that would benefit the domestic rail
network, such as stations. Financing the international aspect of the rail
link was expressly excluded.
But the Treasury and the Department of Transport are understood to have
decided that the break-up of British Rail and the proposed franchising of
its routes to private companies meant they were no longer bound by these
conditions.
The Department of Transport last night declined to comment but an official
said: 'This department is at the forefront of the private finance initiative
(which seeks to get private money into public sector projects) and we are
working closely with the Treasury on this.'
The Channel tunnel rail link is the largest project to be launched under
this initiative and the government is keen to avoid further delays.
A decision to redirect the link's route north of the Thames rather than
through south London has led to delays, and the link is not now expected to
open before 2002.
The announcement of the rail link route next week is expected to confirm St.
Pancras as the north London terminal.

FT  17 JAN 94 / LWT in talks with US media company to fight Granada bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London Weekend Television is in talks with US West, the Denver-based
telephone company, over its taking a large stake in the ITV company, which
is attempting to fight off a hostile takeover bid by Granada.
The deal would be the most far-reaching move yet by a US company into
British television, by pulling together powerful cable and traditional
broadcast television interests.
US West already has significant cable television interests in the UK through
Telewest, its joint venture with Tele-Communications Inc, the largest US
cable television operator. Plans are in train for a Pounds 400m flotation of
Telewest.
Through the joint venture, US West has an interest in television franchises
covering slightly fewer than 3m homes. That puts it in second place in the
UK cable industry, just behind Nynex, the New York and New England telephone
company. If talks succeed, US West would almost certainly take a stake of up
to 29.9 per cent in LWT.
Companies from outside the European Union are prohibited from controlling
ITV franchises, but the definition of control is left to the judgment of the
Independent Television Commission. The National Heritage Department
confirmed yesterday that no maximum percentage stake for non-EU companies is
specified in broadcasting legislation.
Mr Greg Dyke, LWT's chief executive, has been one of the first in the
conventional television industry to take cable television seriously. He
argued for collaboration with ITV at last year's annual cable convention.
Mr Dyke yesterday declined to comment on talks the company might be having
with potential suitors. He said the central plank in LWT's defence against
Granada remained 'our record in the past, what we can achieve in future and
we believe the best is yet to come'.
It is thought that LWT has had a number of approaches from large US media
companies interested in taking a stake.
US West is seen as the present favourite, although it is far from clear
whether the US company would be able to move fast enough to clinch any deal
in the timescale of the Granada bid. The final date for acceptance of the
Granada offer, which values LWT at about Pounds 670m, is February 4.

Acids in margarine could contribute to heart disease, according to research
at Harvard University in the US. A study showed that women who ate large

FT  17 JAN 94 / Gaidar quits Russian cabinet: Decision will worry west;
Yeltsin may press to keep top reformer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Yegor Gaidar, Russia's most prominent economic reformer, said yesterday
he was pulling out of the government to avoid being forced to share
responsibility for 'dangerous' policy decisions.
Announcing his refusal to serve in the new cabinet that Mr Viktor
Chernomyrdin, prime minister, is to name this week, Mr Gaidar said: 'I
cannot work without having the necessary levers at my command . . . where
decisions I have taken are not approved and at the same time decisions I
regard as dangerous are embraced by the government.'
His decision, which appears final, will cause deep concern among western
governments and financial institutions already worried about the prospects
for reform in Russia after December elections that gave anti-reform parties
a majority in the parliament's lower house.
It comes only a day after the departure of President Bill Clinton, who had
been convinced by President Boris Yeltsin during a two-day summit that
reforms would continue and deepen. The government now seems almost certain
to pursue the much slower course of reform favoured by Mr Chernomyrdin.
Mr Gaidar, first deputy prime minister since last September and prime
minister for 10 months in 1992, led the Russia's Choice party in last
month's elections. He will now concentrate on leading his party in the state
duma, the lower house. 'I cannot be, at one and the same time, in the
government and in opposition to it,' he said.
Attempts may still be made, however, to entice Mr Gaidar back into the
cabinet. Mr Vyacheslav Kostikov, Mr Yeltsin's press secretary, said last
night that the resignation 'would seriously weaken the president's reform
flank', and that pressure would be put on him to stay.
Mr Yeltsin is due to meet Mr Chernomyrdin today, and the announcement of the
new government is due today or tomorrow.
The future of other reformers in the cabinet is uncertain - although so far
only one, Mrs Ella Pamfilova, the social security minister and the only
woman in cabinet, has chosen to follow Mr Gaidar. Mr Boris Fyodorov, finance
minister, said: 'One's enthusiasm for work in the government is low.'
In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Fyodorov emphasised that he
would not serve if Mr Viktor Gerashchenko, the central bank chairman, was
confirmed in his post - and said that he, like Mr Gaidar, strongly objected
to a draft agreement with Belarus for the unification of its economy with
Russia's, signed by Mr Yeltsin this month.
'Such agreements cannot be made without reference to either the cabinet or
the state duma. It is effectively the union of one state with another.
However, I may be able to get changes in that agreement, I will have to
see.'
Mr Anatoly Chubais, the deputy premier for privatisation and the only member
of the present government confirmed in post by a presidential decree, was
advised by Mr Gaidar to stay on - as was Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the foreign
minister.
Mr Gaidar said Mr Chernomyrdin had mentioned Mr Grigory Yavlinsky - leader
of the Yabloko group, a rival reform faction to Russia's Choice, in the
lower house - as a possible successor.
Mr Yavlinsky, a well known reformer in Russia and the west, favours stronger
policies on privatisation and de-monopolisation, and on economic union
between the former Soviet republics - but is less concerned about securing a
rapid reduction in inflation and stabilisation of the rouble.
Mr Yavlinsky, asked by the Interfax news agency last night night if he would
serve in government, replied: 'I don't think so, but it's too early to say.'

FT  15 JAN 94 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Melina, use your marbles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I thought: why doesn't the old bat stop whingeing and get down to some
serious ministerial work. Why must she go on and on about the return of the
Elgin marbles to Greece when she knows, in her heart, that the British
Museum will never let them go.
Yet I regretted the thought immediately, and scolded myself severely,
smacking myself on the wrist, banging the side of my head and punching
myself in the ribs. I thought: I like Melina Mercouri, the re-appointed
Greek minister for culture. She was a swinger when I was a boy, and is
doubtless a swinger still.
And I remembered that I have always suspected that the Greek case for the
return of the Elgin marbles to Athens is a smidgin stronger than the British
Museum's case for their retention in London.
What triggered all this brain activity was a report that Melina is working
herself into a lather again about the marbles, and has declared that the
Greek government, with the help of Brussels grants, has built a 'huge
exhibition room' that at present lies 'nude and unclothed', awaiting the
marbles' return.
The British Museum's argument for holding Melina at bay has been summarised
in a statement. It starts: 'Among the sculptures known as the Elgin marbles,
the most important are the frieze and other architectural sculptures rescued
by Lord Elgin from the ruins of the Parthenon, with the approval of the
appropriate authorities, at the beginning of the 19th century.'
It goes on to say that the British Museum is forbidden by law to dispose,
permanently, of objects in its collections (other than duplicates); that its
duty is to preserve its collections for the benefit of international
scholarship and the enjoyment of the public; that in fulfilment of this
responsibility it opens seven days a week, free of charge, and attracts more
than 6.5m visitors a year; that the Parthenon sculptures 'constitute one of
the greatest and best-loved of its treasures'; and that they are housed in a
museum 'which is universal in its scope and is designed to present as
complete and integrated a picture as possible of the development of
different, but related, cultures through the ages'.
In concludes: 'The trustees would regard it as a betrayal of their trust to
establish a precedent for the piecemeal dismemberment of collections which
recognise no arbitrary boundaries of time and place.'
Two years ago, while walking round Leptis Magna, in Libya, with Dr Susan
Walker, the assistant keeper of Greek and Roman antiquities at the British
Museum, I asked her about the Elgin marbles. Dr Susan could out-fox Melina
Mercouri any day, and can be brilliantly succinct.
'How would I crystallise the case for the marbles' retention in London?' she
said. 'OK . . . 1) it would be the start of the end of the British Museum;
2) the marbles' location in London since their purchase from Lord Elgin is
part of their history and story - part of the history of art. They belong
where they are.'
Sorry, Dr Susan; I am not quite convinced. I think the marbles should be
sent home to Greece. I am never impressed by thin-edge-of-the-wedge
arguments ('piecemeal dismemberment . . . '), and I believe that Britain
needs the sort of PR coup which the return of the marbles would precipitate.
But the Greeks must buy them back. As it happens, no one in London will
estimate an open-market value for the Elgin marbles. Christie's told me to
ask the British Museum. I did. 'Can't be done,' said the museum. 'They're
priceless and irreplaceable.'
So we'll call it Pounds 200m. We can call it what we like. But we won't just
settle for Pounds 200m in cash or its equivalent in fetta cheese or bitter
Greek olives or that hopelessly terrible wine. We will settle for three
islands: Chios ('blessed with great beauty and a fascinating history,' says
a handy travel brochure), Hydra ('weekend playground of the rich and
famous') and Patmos ('small yet enchanting').
Before the Greeks go berserk, they should note that I haven't asked for
Macedonia or for anything especially sensitive. Just three islands.
Oh, and unlimited free travel between Greece and Britain for anyone who wins
a villa or apartment on Chios, Hydra or Patmos in the UK national lottery
starting next year. And a few other things that will occur to me eventually.
Get real, Melina; this is 1994.

FT  15 JAN 94 / Private View: In search of future enemies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Because the west can no longer see the enemy, Nato is struggling to find a
role. Around the world the guns keep firing. But without an enemy who can
feel secure?
So, while leaders of the western military alliance were jetting to Brussels
to talk this week about 'partnerships for peace' I took a suburban train
through the snow to Camberley in Surrey to talk about prospects for war.
My target was David Chandler, latest victim of the peace dividend. Last
night, the eve of his 60th birthday, he was pensioned off from his job as
head of war studies at the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst.
A Pickwickian figure in waistcoat and watch chain, Chandler is one of
Britain's leading military historians, a globetrotting Napoleon specialist,
prolific writer and lecturer, adviser to television (latterly, The Great
Commanders), stalwart of the Sealed Knot society for re-enactment of famous
battles.
Dr Chandler is not shy. The letters after his name run right across the
office door and the frontispiece of his latest book is a photograph of the
D. Litt awarded to him by Oxford University. Instead of visiting cards he
hands out witty colour caricatures of himself.
Nor is he short of words: they pour from him like a fusillade from a pom-pom
gun. But behind the rapid fire is a grim realist with a speculative mind:
could the next great war, asks Chandler, be triggered by rival international
business cartels?
He does not see Britain going to war again except as part of an alliance,
unless for some small-scale operation like the Falklands. Neither could he
imagine another struggle between former European adversaries; that is,
unless a 'totally wrong regime' were to gain power via the ultra-right-wing
nationalists now reappearing in Germany, France and, of course, Russia.
So where is the threat coming from?
'I go back to Napoleon's statement. 'Let China sleep. When she wakes the
world will rue it.' China is the unknown card in the pack in a very big
way.'
Chandler was not referring to Britain's dispute over Hong Kong. 'That will
be just a sad last whimper of the British Empire. The Chinese are
humiliating the UK in revenge for the way we treated them in the 19th
century.
'No, the Chinese have got these tremendous resources they haven't even
started to tap, a huge population, this terrific intelligence. And it's a
very heady (he pronounced it 'heedy') combination.'
Would the issue be lebensraum?
'If they haven't got their resources fully mobile they'll have to move to
get other people's resources to maintain their standard of living,
development, industry. That's always been the major thing. Like the Rape of
the Sabine Women. Rome was short of breeding stock. So it went to grab 'em.
Nowadays it's oil.'
What about the Japanese? Aren't they in that position too?
'Ahhh . . . Right. We used to call them the British of Asia in 1905, 'the
gallant little Jap'. They could. You see, they've had a very humiliating
defeat and of course it's difficult for a westerner to fully understand.
They are humiliated and lost face. That is going to be a problem in the
longer term. China will see threats which we would not regard as threats and
feel they must take determinate action, or the Japanese could do it, partly
for revanchism, though they don't want to admit that . . .'
Chandler regards economic competition as a possible cause of war, not a
substitute for it. It was obvious, he said, that the Gulf war was fought
because of Kuwaiti and Saudi oil. Less obviously, Atlantic oil was a prime
reason for the Falklands War.
'When the chips are down you go to war for key resources. If you are going
to suffer a lot, become a slave economy or whatever, that could cause
struggles of this nature.'
Does that mean war is not eradicable?
'In a perfect world it would be. But it's not a perfect world.'
If war was eradicable, I said, it would be a perfect world.
He chuckled. 'Exactly right. Touche.'
There could be conflicts to prevent nuclear proliferation. But there was
still another danger that strategists were now beginning to study:
'It is these huge international cartels, great groupings of
multi-mega-millions of dollars in the hands of relatively small groups of
top industrialists. There is a danger, in my opinion - no more than that -
that they could become the equivalent of the medieval big bad barons,
terrorising people all round them, in a sense. They have so much influence
on standards of living and so forth that in a way they can dictate to
governments.'
They can tell governments to go to war?
'Well, at a pinch, as a last extremity, yes. They might. Shaw in The Apple
Cart foresaw a bit of this . . .
'You see, the multinationals are not moral or immoral, they are amoral. They
are huge, they have terrific influence, great potential for good, or evil if
they do the wrong things. If they get desperate about resources they need to
keep their status they will be looking for countries which they can induce
to do the dirty work, like grabbing, say, a third of China's oil.' Even the
European Union, with its powerful but barely-accountable officials, could be
seen as constituting a cartel.
Chandler is the son of an East Yorkshire vicar and considered entering the
church himself. Like many small boys he was captivated by warlike images: a
picture of a medieval fortress, a tank that spat sparks when you pushed it.
I suggested he had chosen a contrary vocation.
He protested: 'Not for one moment would I claim to be a militarist. I would
hate to be called that. The study of war itself is no more militarism than
the study of medicine means trying to propagate illness. In a way you are
looking for answers: I wouldn't say quite solutions, human nature being what
it is.
What's the difference between 'war studies' and 'peace studies'?
'Ah] Black and white wizards - that's what the peace studies people will
say. They believe they are motivated by avoidance of war at all costs, while
the war student, if that is the right word, is looking for the means of
prosecuting his profession if he needs to.
'Really, there is a lot of common ground. Everyone knows war is wicked.
Trouble is, some of us know there are worse things than war under certain
circumstances - like genocide or the enslavement of people.'
Bosnia had shown again how thin was the veneer of civilisation. At the base
of all humanity there was a streak of violence. It could be constructive,
the drive behind a great book, symphony or building. Or it could be
destructively employed to protect an interest.
Chandler admires Clausewitz's perception that a military commander's
greatest test is 'friction' in war, the idea that if anything can go wrong,
it will. Nor does he share Clausewitz's enthusiasm for war as a necessary,
even noble instrument of state policy. He prefers the Swiss strategist Henri
Jomini, Marshal Ney's chief of staff, first analyst of Napoleon's military
method.
All wars are hell, said Chandler, with a few positive products such as
medical innovation and human courage and comradeship. Wars were inevitable,
too, so long as the United Nations (like the League of Nations or the
Congress of Europe before that) remained a forum for propaganda battles and
adversarial alliance-building rather than an institution of supranational
moral purpose with its own military capability.
'I would call myself a realist more than anything else,' Chandler said. 'I
don't believe necessarily in the perfectibility of human nature. It's not
very different now, I imagine, than 500,000 years ago. Life, and the
struggle for life, does involve violence, even if it's putting out a fire.
There's always danger and risk, surviving a challenge.
'That is my basic interest, the way man reacts and has reacted to the
challenges, the perils and the opportunities of war, which is probably the
most challenging aspect of human existence, the greatest challenge for an
individual and for a society.'
But if we can't sustain the moral imperative for peacekeeping, I said, does
that mean we shall revert to a pre-Cold War age where war was legitimate as
well as inevitable?
'There is a danger of that, I would agree with you, if everything is
breaking up and America hasn't the energy or the incentive to do the whole
thing.'
So we're going to say about former Yugoslavia 'Let the buggers fight it
out'?
'That's the realpolitik. I wouldn't use the word cynical, but I think a very
practical view. Except, we will fight when our own interests are definitely
threatened. Then we will intervene.'
The lessons of history have not made us any more altruistic?
'I'm afraid when the chips are down that is the bottom line.'
So we'll accommodate by saying these kinds of war are an inevitable,
evolutionary development?
'That's a highly realistic-pessimistic view, of course. Being realistic, I
fear that is the way it's going to go.'

FT  15 JAN 94 / Back to front basics: Hugh Dickinson says the government has
underestimated voters' intelligence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH DICKINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Complexity - that is the problem with Back to Basics. Politicians like
things to be simple and believe that the public response to issues, policies
and events will be gut reactions, which they know how to provoke.
Back to Basics was based on two assumptions: first, that the basic gut of
Great Britain is uniform, wholesome and above all simple, and second, that
people do not like to be asked to think. Both are false. The government has
lost the trust of many people because its Back to Basics campaign failed to
recognise that Britain is a complex community with widely differing gut
reactions. Even within the Conservative party the 'basics' of a Suffolk
mayor, a cabinet minister and Sir Edward Heath are manifestly incompatible.
That is not what we mean by basic morality. Sir Edward even says that it is
dangerous for a political party to adopt a moral perspective. You cannot get
much more basic than that.
The Church has been struggling with the problem of morality in a complex
society for hundreds of years. Unless there is a common spiritual commitment
to certain fundamental values, moral exhortation is whistling in the wind.
We have tried it. Certainly, the electorate is deeply anxious about the
moral disintegration suggested by the breakdown of families and a wave of
crime. But the government has made a mistake in supposing that the same
electorate will respond to offers of a quick fix.
It seems, indeed, that the British public is now learning to think about
complex issues - for example embryology - and is quite enjoying the
experience. Yes, there have been some typically gut reactions to 60-year old
pregnancies and to the idea of giving a woman eggs from a dead foetus. But
even those with strong feelings add that we must have time to think.
This is not an easy candidate for a Back to Basics basket. Nor is abortion,
that political land mine just waiting to be trodden on.
Then there are the issues of law and order - dauntingly complex to anybody
except the Neanderthals. Most of us now suspect that longer sentences in
more (privatised) prisons will not reduce crime. It is a sop to the gut of
the rottweiler tendency. Sending naughty boys on trips abroad does stick in
the gullet. But it is at only two thirds of the cost of keeping them in
prison and is three times as effective in preventing them re-offending. That
way of making good citizens out of bad lads will certainly not be part of
the basics basket.
What about traditional family values? Surely the Church will root for them?
Any priest or counsellor who knows the pain and trauma of fractured families
and broken marriages must long for a community stable families and faithful
marriages. But I find myself less and less able to attribute all that human
misery to personal irresponsibility or moral failure. That simple censorious
Back to Basics judgment, which was the gut reaction at the Conservative
Party conference, misses the complex dynamics of families and relationships
under huge psychological pressure in a changing society. It may also be
taking a very rosy view of what happened 50 years ago. Families and
marriages were certainly held together by social controls. But women were
grossly oppressed.
Our politicians seem unable to understand that the frightening symptoms of
social disarray are just that - symptoms. (Any priest knows that the 'sins'
recounted by the penitent are not the real problem.) They point to a much
deeper and systemic malaise which is the direct consequence of policies and
attitudes which have exalted personal choice over community responsibility,
personal gain over the common weal, competition over co-operation. Those are
the basics of the Thatcher years. No one should be surprised that they have
spilled over from public and commercial life into the streets and then into
homes and personal relationships.
The moral fabric of a community is seamless and entire. Adultery matters. It
breaks one thread of the fabric. But so does embezzlement. So does the
alleged suppression by Ministers of the evidence which could acquit three
innocent men in the Matrix Churchill case. So does being economical with the
truth. Such actions erode trust. Our society needs moral reconstruction. But
by public example and a consensus about fundamentals much subtler than a
natty political slogan.

The best works of art are dynamic things, which can unleash effects undreamt

destruction on Tuesday was sad to witness.
The appearance of 'House' at the end of last year electrified the debate
about contemporary art, bringing it into the public domain in the most
direct way by erecting a large scale monument on a London street. For the
artist, the piece was simply the logical next step in the development of her
work, making casts of domestic objects and spaces.
But casting a house, as much as building it, requires the permission of the
relevant authorities, subjecting the normally independent creation of a work
of art to certain outside controls. The lease granted on the site was
temporary, the destruction of the work accepted as part of the conditions
for its creation.
Once revealed, however, the concrete cast of the living spaces of a former
private residence in Bow took on a life of its own. An estimated 100,000
people visited it, and a petition signed by 3,500 called for it to be made
permanent. It was not, and a remarkable and important work has been lost.
The speeches made at the Turner Prize dinner (Rachel Whiteread of course won
the award) referred to dunces and the embattled position of contemporary
art, but they did not win over the authorities of Bow, nor open hearts and
minds to the ready acceptance of contemporary art.
Britain has produced wonderful artists and produces them still: Rachel
Whiteread is one of them. But although the Turner Prize is rightly intended
as an honour, the critical wrangling surrounding it reveals the unease with
which we contemplate the art of our time. A cheque, however substantial, is
not the same as a welcome in the heart, a secure place in the national
bosom. Bow preferred an empty space to a unique monument to the experience
of actually living there.
The one winner of the Turner Prize has literally thousands of anonymous and
struggling peers. Rachel Whiteread recognised this by handing over her
second award, Pounds 40,000 from the K Foundation for the artist judged, by
popular vote, worst of the Turner Prize candidates, to be distributed to ten
other artists, selected from an open submission.
This dignified solution to the acceptance of an 'award' intended only to
humiliate was an object lesson in awareness and generosity, a lesson which
those who mock our visual arts would do well to contemplate.

FT  15 JAN 94 / Arts: Paradox in performance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Why is it that theatre directors who can be so strong on detail make such
sweeping statements about politics and society when it comes to writing a
book or making a speech? One thinks of Richard Eyre, the director of Royal
National Theatre, who wrote in Utopia and Other Places about his fears that
Britain might become a fascist state. Then came Sir Peter Hall, constantly
demanding ever increasing government subsidies for the arts, in his
autobiography, Making an Exhibition of Myself.
A similar question arises in Peter Brook's extended essay, There Are No
Secrets: Thoughts on Acting and Theatre (Methuen, Pounds 12.99, 120 pages).
How is it that a man who seems so liberal, so civilised, so much a seeker
after truth, can emerge as utterly intolerant of others?
Brook makes the point himself inadvertently in a story he tells about his
early days as a director. He allowed a student to attend rehearsals of a
Shakespeare play. All went quietly until he found the student in the local
pub explaining to the actors how they should play their scenes. Almost never
again were outsiders admitted.
Yet the interesting questions about that story are how did the student hold
the actors' attention, what did he have to say them, and why did Brook not
have a talk with him? Such questions did not occur to the director. Instead
he reacted with a ban of the kind which, if practised by governments,
presumably he would disapprove.
There are other examples. Brook writes that he is sometimes asked about the
relation between The Tempest that he did at Stratford 30 years ago and his
more recent production at the Bouffes du Nord. 'This question is absolutely
ridiculous]' he comments. Yet 50 pages later he is discussing the question
himself, and is very revealing on the subject.
One also wonders what Harley Granville Barker, or even George Bernard Shaw,
would have made of his remark that 'the theatre is in no way a discussion
between cultivated people'. Brook thinks that it all a matter of
'enlightenment' which 'can't be taught, though it must always be encouraged
when it appears'.
There is a paradox here. Brook writes very well about the search for
communication between audience and actors. Indeed he is one of the few
directors to stress the importance of the audience. 'In the millisecond long
instant when actor and audience interrelate, as in a physical embrace,'
Brook says, 'it is the density, the thickness, the multi-layeredness, the
richness - in other words, the quality of the moment that counts.' But the
moment of truth can sometimes last an entire scene: see, for instance,
Terence Rattigan's The Deep Blue Sea.
Of course, the audience is crucial. But it is perverse for a director to
turn so sharply against the cultivated classes: they can sometimes be
useful. The production of Harold Pinter's Moonlight before an educated West
End audience is actually much better than the original at the Almeida.
Still, Brook is effective in explaining the way he works, and for that his
book is worth reading.

FT  15 JAN 94 / Arts: Revival of the well-turned song - Cabaret is making a
comeback
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bobby Short is as big a feature of Manhattan as the Empire State and the
yellow cabs. Most nights for the past four decades he has sat beaming at the
piano in the Carlyle Hotel, bringing into a more austere age some of the
glamour and style of pre-war society.
When the Duke of Windsor wanted to give the Duchess a good time he took her
to the Carlyle where he made Bobby Short's life complicated by asking for
the song about 'blackbirds: no, not Bye-bye Blackbird, the other one.'
Short, whose knowledge of 20th century music is encyclopaedic, immediately
played an obscure number from the 1920s, 'Just a bluebird looking for a
blackbird to love.'
He performed it again this week, but not at the Carlyle. He is playing one
of his very rare away fixtures, at the Green Room in the Cafe Royal, until
January 22. The Cafe Royal is a strange place these days. The ground floor
restaurant still retains enough decadent plush to make Oscar and Bosie feel
at home, but up the gilded staircase management-man takes over, with
featureless rooms given over to corporate gatherings.
The setting for Short is more Crossroads Motel than Caesar's Palace, but he
can provide the class. He bounces on, looking like a wide eyed cherub, to
join his drummer and excellent bass player, and it is straight into a Cole
Porter medley. Now knocking 70, the voice is starting to show signs of wear
and tear but Short plays the piano with a style probably almost extinct. It
carries on a duet with his wonderful phrasing, and as the classics flow, 'I
Can't Get Started'; 'Tea for Two'; 'Miss Otis Regrets' you realise that you
are catching an art form near the end of its natural life.
The world of sophisticated cabaret, with witty lyrics and insidious tunes,
has become as extinct as the music hall or castrato arias. It will still be
performed, but by imitators and impersonators. Short knew the period. He
talks familiarly about speakeasies and slipping away from Prohibition
America to Cuba for a drink. As he stands and reminisces about Bessie and
Ira, a slight, eloquent figure, without race or class, he is as spellbinding
as when he plays their music.
'I am now going to play a medley which is sophisticated, swish, and so
terribly expensive that alone it is worth the price of your ticket' he says
 -and then plays 'Do I Love You'; 'Just One of Those Things'; and more
brittle memories of a dead past. It is Noel Coward with commitment; an
immersion, with sad touches, into a lost art form. Bobby Short should be
seen as the last of the breed, but as he ends, naturally, with 'A
Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square', he also touches the nostalgia for a
lost innocence which is as much a vision as a dream.
And at the commercial level it could be a vision, for cabaret seems to be
making a come back in London. Perhaps it is fin de siecle decadence, which
inspired the Parisian cabaret of the 1890s, or the need to smile through
hard times, which made night life in Berlin in the 1920s so creative, but
London is not such a cabaret-free zone these days.
Of course the national temperament is too diffident to embrace cabaret in
all its tackiness, and there is a woeful shortage of venues, but anyone
seeking drollery past midnight is better served than in the past. Even early
bedders can join in the fun with nice Kit and the Widow currently being
awfully bitchy about our national institutions at the Vaudeville in the
Strand.
As well as the Green Room at the Cafe Royal, which has Clark Peters, creator
of Five Men Named Moe, following on from Bobby Short, there is Pizza on the
Park, where cabaret artists like Issy van Randwyck fill in between jazzers;
the Chesterfield Hotel, which has introduced dinner jazz evenings; and
Drones, which puts on monthly cabaret. The spate of musicals over the last
decade has thrown up scores of singers who want to go solo when their West
End contracts expire.
There are also new song writers, like Kit Hesketh-Harvey, Peter Reeves, and
what seems to be a collection of song writing vicars. Their work is
sometimes witty, sometimes painful, all contemporary. Cabaret can build
again on this revival of the well-turned song, in which the lyrics drive the
melody as they did for Cole Porter and the Gershwins. All that is needed is
more venues.

FT  15 JAN 94 / Arts: New look at an auld aquaintance - As Burns Night
approaches, Michael Glover considers the legacy of Scotland's greatest poet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL GLOVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As we raise our glasses once again on January 25 to the memory of the poet
and iconoclast Rabbie Burns, the questions arise: who was he? why do we do
it? and, perhaps most pertinent of all, is he still worth reading?
Burns the man and Burns the myth were inextricably linked from the beginning
 -largely thanks to the cunning and enterprise of Burns himself. He was born
in 1759, the son of a poor Ayrshire tenant farmer who nevertheless employed
a pedantic itinerant schoolmaster to teach young Rab the best in English
literature and grammar. From his illiterate mother, Burns imbibed an even
more precious heritage - that of Scottish songs and ballads.
He was published early, and was quickly lionised in Edinburgh as a young
prodigy - but not a learned prodigy. According to the earliest critics, he
breathed the sublime air of the 'Heavenly ploughman' and was an example of
untutored genius.
He went along with all this but was, in fact, extremely well read. He was a
great enthusiast for the empiricism of John Locke, he read fellow Scot Adam
Smith's The Wealth of Nations with approval; and he gave considerable
support to the French revolution before that great movement turned into an
unseemly parody of its own ideals.
Burns later recanted, denying that he had ever called himself a republican.
But one aspect of his view of politics remained unchanged: that it was a
game played by the rich at the expense of the poor. The belief that the
long-suffering common man remains the repository of honest values is evident
everywhere in his poetry.
Was he really the drunken fornicator that his early Calvinistically-inclined
biographers castigated him for being? As always with Burns, the answer is
both yes and no. Yes, he drank heavily. But perpetual drunkards do not
produce poetry of the quality that Burns produced. His appetite for other
women was regarded with tolerance by his wife Jean Armour, who once said
'Our Robbie should have had twa wives'.
He wrote some poetry in English, the language of his tutor, but it was
nothing beside the extraordinary vitality of his work in Scots, from the
best of the songs to the great satires on the Kirk, whose pricks he was
forever kicking against.
He lived out the identity crisis that Scotland was suffering so acutely in
the late 18th century, as the gradual process of anglicisation denied the
Scots tongue its rightful place as one of Scotland's native literary
languages, along with Gaelic. By the end of the 18th century, fashionable
literature had to be written in English and Burns's 'dialect' poems were
regarded as whimsical affairs at best.
In his heart, Burns was in fierce revolt against all this; but he knew the
power of the patron and made the necessary compromises. The worst, perhaps,
was his decision - as symbolic an act of treachery as can be imagined - to
seek office as an Exciseman, that enemy of every self-respecting Scots
drinker.
The great satires aside, are his songs - of which he thought very little and
for which he refused payment - his most enduring legacy? Anyone who listens
to Jean Redpath's definitive versions of them -all available on cassette
(Greentrax, Pounds 7), and gradually becoming available on CD (Greentrax,
Pounds 11) - might well think so.
The best and most approachable new anthology is Rhymer Rab, edited by Alan
Bold (Black Swan, Pounds 6.99), which offers a chronological survey of Burns
in poetry, letters and miscellaneous prose. A good, though academically more
severe, edition of the Selected Poems (Penguin Classics, Pounds 6.99) has
just been edited by Carol McGuirk; Catherine Carswell's excellent Life of
Robert Burns (Canongate, Pounds 5.95), first published in the 1930s to a
storm of indignation, destroyed many of the myths fondly held by misty-eyed
Burnsians. Burns Now, edited by Kenneth Simpson, (Canongate, Pounds 12.50),
is a new collection of essays that reassesses Burns as poet, thinker and
songwriter.

FT  15 JAN 94 / Arts: The magic of Horowitz - Records
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Horowitz: The Complete Masterworks Recordings, 1962 -73. Boxed set of 13 CDs
grouped in nine volumes. Sony Classical SX13K 53 456
Throughout his long life Vladimir Horowitz was involved in making records -
not continually, but in bursts separated by long intervals of silence, all
of which mirrored the ebb and flow of his extraordinary career. His
involvement began in Hamburg, in 1926, with a session devoted to creating a
set of piano rolls for use on a player-piano.
In the early 1930s he was a regular visitor to the recording studios. But
then came those longer breaks, reflecting the pianist's depression-dominated
withdrawals from concert-giving. Between 1953 and 1965, when he made no
public appearances whatsoever, the RCA Victor company continued to record
him, but mostly at his New York home; these and other items from the
RCA-Horowitz partnership have been regularly re-issued on CD.
There has been an equally steady CD stream of the recordings that Deutsche
Grammophon made from 1985 to 1989 (the year of his death), of an artist in
his 80s and miraculously restored to health and performance after the
medically-drugged darkness and silence of the previous two years. In
addition, a 1990 EMI References two-disc album republished a valuable number
of Horowitz goodies from the 1930-51 period.
But perhaps the most enticing issue of Horowitz records is the new,
large-scale one by Sony. As purchaser of the CBS label, the Japanese company
owns the rights to the CBS recordings of 1962-73, in many respects the
golden period of Horowitz's recording career.
This is the complete set of Horowitz's recordings from his 60s and 70s.
Super-complete, indeed, since that handful of Scarlatti, Debussy and
Skryabin items for which space was lacking on CBS's original LPs is now
included. The box set is handsome. Its 13 component CDs are intelligently
grouped in nine subject-volumes, each of which is graced by a scene-setting
essay by Thomas Frost, Horowitz's CBS record-producer, as well as by a
general Horowitz appreciation from Byron Janis, the most distinguished of
his pupils.
The reasons one may claim this as the golden period of Horowitz's recording
career - and for the newcomer to the marvels of his playing probably the
best starting-point - have to do with both the sound-characteristics of the
CBS recordings and the particular quality of Horowitz's performances. RCA
Victor's discs of the 1940s and '50s, though they contain examples of his
art at its most compelling (such as his 1951 version of the Rakhmaninov
Third Piano Concerto, a contained, controlled pianistic whirlwind unleashed
with indescribable brilliance - available on RCA GD87754), tended to be
boxy, airless in sound. Too often this over-emphasises, to a point verging
on listener's discomfort, the mailed-fist forcefulness of Horowitz's bravura
playing.
Even in those live CBS recordings - such as those from the celebrated 1965
and 1966 Carnegie Hall concerts, given here in Volume 3 under the title 'The
Historic Return' - the recording ambience achieves, by contrast, a warmer,
rounder, more 'filled-out' impression of the Horowitz sound-world. And so,
even though there is no dulling or diminishing of the current of Horowitz
electricity (as on occasion there was to be in the post-1973 period), the
CBS-Sony records show how much wider, more wonderfully musical was his art
than that of the RCA-Victor keyboard wizard.
Listening to these 13 CDs, I was seized all over again by the conviction
that the keyboard-wizard legend has only ever told part of the Horowitz
story. A true part, undoubtedly: on Volume 9, devoted to 'Late Russian
Romantics' ie Skryabin, Rakhmaninov and a single, delectable Medtner 'Fairy
Tale', the diablerie he brings to such Skryabin works as the Op. 65 no 3
Study or 'Vers la flamme' - compounded of the tightest, lightest, most
ferociously accurate rhythmic and tonal focus, and the ability to layer each
line of thought with unimaginable distinctness - is the stuff of that
legend.
The 'Grand Romantic master of them all' was Dominic Gill's phrase for
Horowitz (uttered on this page) when he returned to London in 1982, after
three decades of absence: it is this master whose Skryabin and Rakhmaninov
excites almost to the point of frenzy even such a listener as myself,
normally apt to feel pretty swiftly the onset of boredom at the transports
of both composers. But it is the delicate, musically delightful Horowitz
that has lingered longest in my mind - the Horowitz of the Clementi,
Scarlatti, Mozart and Bach-Busoni readings, with their wit and subtlety of
hue, their fabulous imaginative responses to the dramatic potential of
texture and rhythm, their bel-canto conception of melody-singing.
The controversy that all his life accompanied the Horowitz legend - was he
just a set of ten super-brilliant fingers or a 'real' musician? - must, I
believe, be settled once and for all by this splendidly vast conspectus of
his peculiar gifts. Of course, in the work of so supremely 'personal' an
pianist, not everything will convince every listener equally. I take endless
pleasure in the clarity of sound and shape of his best Beethoven accounts,
while recognising that for many their distance from the world of High German
seriousness will count as an insuperable handicap.
Occasionally, a passing quirkiness proves disconcerting. More often I find
myself hearing, in the iridescent tracery of his phrasing, a musicianship
that may not belong to the later 20th-century but is no less elemental for
that. Of performances such as the Schumann Fantasy and Kreisleriana
contained here, Neville Cardus's description still stands supreme - 'not
interpretations but enchantments'. The price of this 13-CD compendium is
hefty. Considered in the light of all the enchantments on offer, it is a
bargain.

FT  15 JAN 94 / Arts: South Bank tunes up for the future - Off the Wall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Think of the Royal Festival Hall and you think of orchestral concerts. If it
is not the LPO playing Beethoven, Brahms and Tchaikovsky, it is the
Philharmonia playing Tchaikovsky, Beethoven and Brahms.
There is little wrong with that if that is what the punters want. But there
are increasing signs that the audience for classical music is getting so
elderly that it is falling off its ticket buying perch. Some estimates put
70 per cent of the audience in the over-50 age bracket and as they increase
in years they reduce their visits. Attendances at the South Bank have
slumped from 81 per cent to 60 per cent over the last 20 years, and although
the LPO and the Philharmonia have attracted larger audiences than their
competitors, no one is complacent about the long term future of classical
music at the Festival Hall.
Of course it will still be played there most nights, but the South Bank has
hired David Sefton to seek out a younger audience and spice up the
programming with a Pounds 200,000 pump-priming fund. The money can be used
to offer new promoters a guarantee against loss on their events, while
Sefton is secretly confident that, with good judgment, there will be a
profit to divide up.
The Festival Hall cannot quite shake off its cultural heritage and is
reluctant to go down the classical 'pops' route, despite the success of
impresarios like Raymond Gubbay. At the Barbican and the Royal Albert Hall,
Gubbay packs them in for themed events like a Valentine's Day Love Classics
concert at the Barbican (with every lady receiving a red rose), and
Classical Spectaculars, with lasers and big bangs, at the Albert Hall.
At the South Bank, Sefton is keener to develop concerts of movie music,
often in conjunction with the adjacent National Film Theatre, which is also
suffering an audience fall. The Liverpool Philharmonic is lined up to play
Michael Nyman's music for The Piano and Philip Glass's new soundtrack for
Cocteau's La Belle et la Bete will also be performed. The audience will
often be able to see the movie and hear the concert.
There are also plans to develop joint promotions with the Lincoln Center in
New York, which faces similar problems. The Lincoln might take the South
Bank's summer Meltdown festival, when an artist creates his personal
programme (this year it is composer Louis Andriessen, next year Elvis
Costello), while the South Bank could gain from the Lincoln's idea of a
theatre whizz-kid masterminding a classical music performance (Robert Wilson
directing Jessye Norman is the most likely import).
Pop, jazz and rock promoters are being courted - after all, Jimi Hendrix
once picked the guitar with his teeth at the Festival Hall. A typical
compromise event being considered is Sting performing his songs with an
orchestra. South Bank director Nicholas Snowman is even prepared to allow
this more laid back audience to bring their drinks into the performance. The
aim is the trendy avant-garde, the Steve Reich, kd Lang, Theatre de
Complicite fan clubs, rather than Shirley Bassey's, although that Welsh diva
will be belting out for a week in October.
There are problems in broadening the repertoire, mainly the priority given
to the resident orchestra, the LPO, and the first reserve, the Philharmonia,
on bookings years in advance and rehearsal facilities. Sefton is negotiating
a more flexible arrangement with the orchestras.
In the autumn the South Bank will launch a new corporate identity and embark
on a substantial marketing programme to tell the world about its wider
appeal. But it must know that the fall in demand for its classical music is
a symptom of a much wider problem - the feeling that a trip to the South
Bank is a journey into the past, that the buildings are a decaying remnant
of a brutalist architectural age, now inhabited by relics of the underclass.
Money is being spent internally, on improving the acoustics, back stage
areas, the lifts, lavatories, etc. but in the long term the South Bank needs
to make a convincing case to the government for Lottery money to knock down
its more oppressive features - the Hayward Gallery, the walkways - and seize
the chance offered by the smart new Channel terminus at nearby Waterloo, the
refurbishment of County Hall as a hotel, and the potential development of
the riverside car park site as the home of the Tate Gallery of Modern Art,
to make the South Bank the popular arts centre which it never quite became.
*
It can hardly be a coincidence that on the day that Lord Gowrie was
confirmed as the next chairman of the Arts Council, the Department of
National Heritage backed off in its efforts to ruin the Serpentine Gallery
in Hyde Park by raising its rent to unreasonable levels.
Gowrie was chairman of the Serpentine, one of London's main showcases for
contemporary art. (He has naturally had to resign on taking over the
Council). He was appalled at the idea floated by Iain Sproat, number two at
the DNH, and a firm opponent of such art, that if the Gallery could not pay
its way the site might be better used as an equestrian centre.
Once again Sproat showed his uncanny ability to ruffle feathers when he
strays from his sports brief into the arts. Sproat's boss, Peter Brooke,
quickly stamped on the proposal and Gowrie was saved the embarrassment of
resigning as chairman of the Council before he was appointed.
*
All those arts companies losing the services of the retiring Princess of
Wales as patron can only look on in envy as the RSC (president the Prince of
Wales) picks up a Pounds 3.3m sponsorship from Allied-Lyons. The company's
chairman Michael Jackaman was among the businessmen attending a Buckingham
Palace gala in the autumn hosted by the Prince at which the RSC showed off
its paces in the grandest of surroundings.
Although Allied-Lyons selected the RSC after a protracted marketing audit,
the evening at the Palace must have helped to cement the relationship. As
must the appearance of the twin children of Tony Hales, Allied-Lyons chief
executive, in walk-on roles in a recent RSC production of A Winter's Tale at
Hales's home town of Stratford-on-Avon.

<TEXT>
Alasdair Gilchrist Fisher died of cancer at the age of 24. As his illness
overcame him, he took to landscape painting. Nothing could be more
appropriate as a memorial to him than an annual award in his name to be
given to a young artist whose special commitment was to landscape painting.
The age limit is 30 and the prize Pounds 3000. Last summer an independent
jury chose six finalists from a slide submission of over 100, who were then
invited to take part in a joint exhibition at which the final decision would
be taken. That took place last Monday.
Daniel Preece, for all its awkwardnesses, offered the single most ambitious
and impressive painting in the show, of a large Welsh mountainside. Peter
Grierson's looser and more abstracted expressionism achieved a rich
concentration of effect. Stacey Billups was somewhat the odd one out, her
large surreal inventions more objects in landscape rather than landscape
alone, but entirely sustained and convincing even so.
Alasdair Wallace was another inventive surrealist rather than an artist
responding to the seen world. In his case, though, the invention was in the
composition overall, the detail beautifully observed. Tom Hammick came the
closest to abstraction, his largest paintings the simplest matter of horizon
dividing ground and sky, but carried off with admirable conviction.
The award, finally, went to Angela Hughes, for her large landscape drawings
that grow ever more simple and evocative, and for her small oil studies that
were, quite simply, the most accomplished works in the show. But do go and
support them all.
At Cadogan Contemporary, 108 Draycott Avenue SW3, until Jan22.

FT  15 JAN 94 / Arts: All-German Schubert - Recital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is surprising that the vast Schubert song edition that Graham Johnson is
undertaking on record has not spawned more live performances. If time and
money were available, it would be an added attraction to follow each of the
singers presenting their programmes at the Wigmore Hall.
So far the list of those taking part has embraced British and international
singers, but that could be about to change. Apparently, the volumes
featuring English-speaking singers have not been achieving good sales. Faced
with consumer pressure, Johnson may be asked to increase the ratio of native
German speakers. As the leading German recitalists (Fassbaender and
Schreier) have already taken part, that means looking further afield.
Hence the programme at the Wigmore Hall on Thursday. Under the title of
'International Songmakers' came an all-Schubert recital with two young
German singers - the soprano Juliane Banse and the baritone Roman Trekel. It
was wise to pair them, as they display complementary virtues. Banse has a
bright personality, but the voice loses its focus when she sings quietly,
sounding breathy and impure; Trekel commands a fine lyric baritone, but is
phlegmatic.
The first half was pure Graham Johnson territory, a collection of
rarely-heard songs to the texts of Friedrich von Schlegel. The philosopher
poet looked for God in nature and his work is immersed in the typical
imagery of early 19th-century romanticism, invoking moon and stars, flowers
and bushes, birds and butterflies. Banse brought some spirit to 'Die Berge',
Trekel a quiet eloquence to 'Der Schiffer', but it was Johnson's piano
accompaniments, played with the lid up and plenty of colour, that had most
to say about the music.
The second half featured Schubert favourites, more of them than the didactic
Johnson ever usually allows in one evening. (Was he worried that the hall
might not be full?) Here both singers struggled to leave an imprint on paths
so often traversed by the great Schubertians, most nearly succeeding with
Banse's tender 'Schlaflied' and a lively 'Der Musensohn' from Trekel. During
the dullest 'Erlkonig' that I have heard there was time to admire Johnson's
slaying of the killer triplets in the piano part. Ten years of Schubert show
no sign of sapping his enthusiasm.

FT  15 JAN 94 / Arts: From naive to native - Susan Moore admires an
Americana exhibition in London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Echoes of the Old World resound throughout the American Museum in Claverton
Manor, Bath. This remarkable but little known collection of American
furniture, decorative art and folk art was gathered in the mid-1950s by an
American, Dallas Pratt, and an Englishman, John Judkyn.
Some 18 period rooms are recreated, from a 17th century Keeping Room
constructed with beams and floorboards from a Puritan house in
Massachusetts, to an opulent French-inspired mid-19th century bedroom of a
Louisiana plantation house. Other galleries are devoted to native Americans,
the Shakers and the so-called Pennsylvania Dutch - a corruption of Deutsch -
to American pewter, textiles, silver and glass.
A representative selection of over 100 exhibits, from furniture to naive
paintings, is currently enlivening Christie's Great Rooms in London. The
glory of the show is the spectacular group of American quilts. In pride of
place is the Baltimore album quilt dated 1847, each square executed by a
different hand and brimming with cornucopias of fruit and flowers. The
stylised hearts in the borders proclaim it a bridal quilt.
There is a quilt made by slaves, another by the industrious Sarah Taylor,
one of the first women physicians in Philadelphia, and a poignant
black-darted widow's quilt - the only one on show made for a single bed.
It is hard not to see Rothko and friends in the dark geometries and floating
grounds of the Amish quilts and the bold Navajo blankets.
Furniture ranges from the simple trastero or cupboard from a Spanish
colonial adobe house in New Mexico to the refined chairs by the Boston and
Philadelphia cabinet-makers working from English pattern books. In the hands
of the Shakers, the English ladderback farmhouse chair is transformed into
something far more attenuated and elegant.
The spare, clean lines, good materials, sound craftsmanship and strictly
functional aesthetic of this furniture prefigure the productions of the Old
World's Arts and Crafts movement.
The exhibition, sponsored by Mobil, launches a major appeal to raise Pounds
3.5m for an endowment fund to secure the future of the museum and continues
at Christie's, 8 King Street, St James's, until January 27. Claverton Manor
re-opens for the summer season on March 26.

OBSCURE KINGDOMS
by Edward Fox
Hamish Hamilton Pounds 16.99, 240 pages
In this stylish, informative and sometimes very funny book, American-born
journalist Edward Fox recounts his personal pilgrimage to five of the
world's remoter monarchies. He went because he wished to understand what
makes kings and kingdoms tick. His travels took him to Tonga, Oman, Nigeria,
Swaziland and Java. In each he had fascinating and sometimes hilarious
adventures, related in a dry and sharply observant prose which signals the
arrival, in this first book, of a major writing talent.
Fox turned his back on European royalties because he wished to encounter
monarchy afresh, in unfamiliar guises. But he repeatedly found himself 'face
to face with what I was fleeing: the hand of the British, recreating the
empire in their own image.' Were it not for the British none of these
monarchies would be as they are; most would not even exist.
Tonga's King Tupou IV granted Fox an audience, and during it demonstrated a
simplified method of addition for use in primary schools. The King not only
invents things - a joint rugby and soccer goal post, used all over Tonga, is
another example - but conducts agricultural experiments, solves
archaeological problems, and is the holder of his kingdom's pole-vault
record. He is the fattest man in Tonga because he eats the most, a sign of
royal power. It is clear that Fox, although bemused by Tupou, enjoyed
meeting him, and learned an important lesson: that delays and difficulties
are occupational hazards of royalty-watching.
It was much more difficult for Fox to get at His Majesty the Sultan of Oman,
an absolute monarch in the traditional oriental mould. He succeeded in
attending a levee at which subjects queue to shake the Sultan's hand; but
requests for an interview were denied, and when Fox tried to observe the
Sultan on his annual meet-the-people tour, in a Bedouin-style cavalcade with
Mercedes Benzes substituting for camels, he failed. So instead he read the
history of Oman and the 'mirrors for princes' written to instruct rulers,
and pondered on the fact that 'roads and roundabouts are the distinctive
post-oil Arabian art form', explained perhaps by the fact that they
represent an 'ultimate triumph over the former hardships of desert travel'.
Fox did not come away unimpressed; when he went to shake the Sultan's hand
it was in a throne-room that looked like the inside of a gigantic Faberge
egg.
After difficulties of Oman Fox found Nigeria a joy, because it has not one
but hundreds of kings and he was able to interview a number of them - the
Aragbiji of Irigbiji, the Akirun of Ikirun, and even the two greatest
'obas', the Alaafin of Oyo and the Ooni of Ife. In Yoruba religion Ife is
the site of Creation. The exact spot, Fox reports, lies opposite a Total
petrol station, marked by an enigmatic granite pillar. Each oba is a
guardian of the traditional religion. For those who are now Moslem or
Christian this presents difficulties. To become an oba one has to eat the
dried heart of one's predecessor, served in soup. But the benefits, it
seems, usually outweigh scruples; on meeting an oba one says 'Kabiyesi]'
which can either be translated 'May you live long' or 'You cannot be
contradicted'.
Heartened by his successes in Nigeria Fox proceeded to Swaziland, only to be
disappointed again. Young King Mswati III proved unmeetable, hidden behind
layers of suspicious advisers. Fox noted a mysterious empathy between the
Swazis and the British: 'They saw a bit of themselves in each other. Each
had a culture of clenched good manners, restraint, discipline,
understatement and secrecy, arranged in a strict social hierarchy with a
King at the top.' The Swazis have a saying: 'Let the Swazi and the English
deceive each other with politeness, and the Zulu and the Boer have it out
with clubs.'
But all frustrations were compensated in Java, where Fox had a satisfying
encounter with Sultan Hamengkubuwono X of Yogyakarta, whose full name runs
to two dozen words. Here Fox was able to meditate on the secret of monarchy:
its place between the secular and divine, its use of the mysteries of
inaccessibility, its function as a centre for artistic display, political
patronage, and symbolic meanings. It is a privilege of royalty to be
unavailable when it chooses; in Nigeria an oba's henchmen would turn away
petitioners by saying his master was still abed. 'These kings were like
disappointing zoo animals,' Fox remarks, 'always asleep when you wanted to
see them.'
The author of this highly entertaining mixture of travelogue, history and
royal essay appears as a wryly engaging observer. One looks forward to his
next book with great relish.

FT  15 JAN 94 / Books: Tales from the Raj - The heyday of the ICS

<TEXT>
ANGLO-INDIAN ATTITUDES: THE MIND OF THE INDIAN CIVIL SERVICE
by Clive Dewey
Hambledon Press Pounds 25, 292 pages
This brilliantly written book evokes the Raj but does not glorify it.
I would have thought that whatever had to be said about the Indian Civil
Service (ICS) had been said by Philip Mason in two authoritative books, The
Founders and The Guardians. Not so. The Mason books to a large extent dealt
with events and achievements of the Raj seen through the lives of the
civilians who ran the Raj machine. These books, it now seems, paid less
attention to 'intellectual history and the influence of ideas'.
Clive Dewey successfully breaks new ground and attempts an intellectualised
treatment of the ICS through the lives and work of two middle-level civil
servants, both allotted to the great province of the Punjab. Both were
Cambridge men. Their response to India was as different as chalk from
cheese. Frank Brayne (1882-1952) came to the ICS believing in the 'Gospel of
uplift'; for Malcolm Darling (1880-1969) it was 'the Cult of Friendship'.
Brayne was an Evangelist; Darling a Forsterian Humanist. Frank Brayne's
hobbies were pig-sticking, riding and walking; Darling's were reading,
writing, travelling and friendship.
These two men were almost exact contemporaries and each spent 35 years in
India. Such was the spell and romance of the Raj that young men out of
Oxbridge went to India with a spring in their step and quickly learnt to
come to terms with discomfort, disease and an alien environment. Some
attempted to appreciate and understand the complex and ancient civilisation
that they encountered and a few 'went native.' But a majority remained what
Forster called 'a disagreeable lot.' The memsahibs, with few exceptions were
more deadly than the sahibs.
When Brayne and Darling arrived in the opening years of this century, the
Raj appeared imperishable and the ICS, called the 'heaven born service', had
kept the Raj machine well-oiled since 1858. By the time the two officials
reached the midway point of their careers, Gandhi had made sure that the
twilight of the Raj had begun. April 1919 was a turning point - General Dyer
shot dead hundreds of peaceful and unarmed Indians in the Jallian Walsh Bagh
in Amritsar and the Raj never really recovered from this self-inflicted
blow.
After the first world war the best and the brightest from Britain no longer
opted for the ICS and the Indian component increased considerably, producing
brown sahibs whom Nehru later described as the 'hollow men'.
The author's view is that while most ICS men were 'eclectics', Brayne and
Darling were 'doctrinaires', preaching and promoting their pet theories. It
is an interesting approach and Dewey has made out a plausible case. If I
have got him right, he would rather choose Darling for a companion than
Brayne. So would I.
Darling liked Indians; Brayne did not. Brayne wrote books about village
India with pompous titles, while Darling quoted Tagore in his masterly
studies of Indian village life. Brayne was an assertive propagandist,
Darling was self-effacing. Brayne made a lot of noise about his village
uplift scheme in Gurgaon near Delhi, which certainly attracted attention,
but left no lasting impact. Mahatma Gandhi disapproved of Brayne's
enthusiasms and said so.
The civil servants knew each other well but were not friends. Darling was
sympathetic to India's freedom movement while Brayne thought Indians lazy
and unreliable. An assistant commissioner is quoted as saying. 'Today has
been a most futile day, Mr. FL Brayne has arrived. He is quite widely
recognised as a bore, and today he lived up to his reputation'. No one ever
wrote such remarks about Darling.
Darling befriended Indians and even tried to put some sense into his
erstwhile ward, the erratic Maharaja of Devas, whom EM Forster immortalised
in The Hill of Devil (dedicated to Malcolm Darling).
Brayne and Darling were two sides of the Raj coin and Dewey has delineated
their characters with a sureness of touch in a sparkling book which suggests
that it was the cult of friendship, rather than the gospel of uplift, which
survived the end of the Raj.

THE ENGINEER IN THE GARDEN
by Colin Tudge
Jonathan Cape Pounds 17.99, 398 pages
As Bernard Shaw said to Ellen Terry: 'Yes, but what if our children had my
looks and your brains?' Genetic engineering promises to help them out. It
can also change the plants and animals we share the earth with.
What is genetic engineering? It sounds easy: a strip of material carrying
genetic information is snipped from one organism and patched into another.
The cells' enzymes tidy up. What genetic engineering offers is a cross
between the specific genes of any life form with any other life form. For
humans, all we have to do is sort out the 100,000 genes divided or scattered
into 3 billion base pairs. Each one does something different.
Colin Tudge has written a frustrating book, The Engineer in The Garden which
charts the history and state of genetic engineering. Equipped with a
glossary of genetic terms and a few 'idiot' guides, a reader would have some
chance. But Tudge makes it hard going. The information is embedded, like
small fossils, in the bedrock of the prose. There is no list of further
reading, no page of notes, and no chronological table of genetic science.
These serious doubts aside, this can be a rewarding book. Tudge starts with
Darwin on natural selection (1859) and arrives at Crick and Watson on 'The
molecular structure of nucleic acids: a structure for deoxyribose nucleic
acid (DNA)' in 1953. Then come the molecular biologists and Michael
Crichton's DNA chains on screen at Jurassic Park. En route, Tudge treats no
question as trivial and delivers masses of information. But the result
confused.
While we learn about bees, gannets, deer, peacocks and crocodile eggs, Tudge
moves between scientific practice and its history. He covers the moral
issues which surround DNA fingerprinting and genetic enhancement. He invokes
the twin imperatives of hubris and blasphemy which seem to be the only
concepts developed enough to counter an unchecked drive into a geneticised
future. One piece of good news: since DNA in men and women behaves
differently, neither gender is superfluous. Neither is sex, or at least
there is now an alluring scent called 'DNA' . . . in a double-helix shaped
bottle.
Tudge steers clear of the commercial concerns which drive the research. But
gene technology with bioengineering have a future as limitless as life
itself. Last month's Regulation of the United Kingdom Biotechnology Industry
and Global Competitiveness* suggested that food containing genetically
engineered organisms need not be labelled for consumers; it also pointed out
that 'excessively precautionary' and 'unscientific' regulations might be
handicapping the UK biotechnology industry alongside less stringent controls
in the US and Japan.
But how is the human species doing, genetically? Tudge has a good chapter on
human improvability. Darwin knew rightly that each species has 'descent with
modification.' We are bigger, taller, healthier than we used to be, but why
are not we all Bach or Einstein or Freud? Is there a gene which causes
absent-mindedness in the same sense as there is a gene which causes blue
eyes or wrinkles?
The Human Genome Project predicts a map of every gene in the body inside ten
years. Already inherited deafness, cystic fibrosis and sickle-cell anemia
have been linked to single genes; and now the genes which cause inherited
breast cancer have been traced to positions on the chromosome, give or take
half a million pairs.
Tudge's book follows the genre evolved by Richard Dawkins and Stephen Jay
Gould: intellectual scientific commentary. As more books like this one
emerge, we should recognise that 'intellectual' and 'scientist' are
gradually and rightly converging in the public mind. The arty side of CP
Snow's 'Two Cultures' will have to adapt to survive in a hostile world.

THE BOYS: A BIOGRAPHY OF MICHEAL MACLIAMMOIR AND HILTON EDWARDS
by Christopher Fitz-Simon
Nick Hern Books Pounds 17.99, 320 pages
The Boys succeeded Lady Gregory and Yeats as the custodians of the Irish
genius for theatre but neither Hilton Edwards nor Micheal MacLammoir was
Irish. The story of these partners in every sense of the word for over 50
years, and the company they kept going in spite of chronic financial crisis,
was well worth telling in detail. In this book Christopher Fitz-Simon, an
Irish theatre director, who was for some years artistic director of the
Abbey Theatre, gives most thoroughly the history of the great rival to the
Abbey, the Gate Theatre.
Dublin in the late 1920s, when the Gate began, was a very closed society.
The Abbey - founded in 1904 - was still in the iron grip of the formidable
Lady Gregory. Dennis Johnston, a Dublin lawyer of Ulster Protestant
ancestry, sent the Abbey an expressionist play he had written about Robert
Emmet. It came smartly back to him, rejected. As he opened the envelope he
noticed that someone had inscribed in pencil on the back 'The old lady says
'No']'. It was under that title that the play was eventually put on in 1929
at the newly formed Gate Theatre in Dublin, directed by Hilton Edwards with
Micheal MacLammoir, as the Speaker (Emmet), and it gave them their first
sensational success with a new play.
The Boys were variously gifted. Both frequently appeared on stage,
MacLammoir, in major parts. London recognised his consummate acting when he
appeared in Hedda Gabler with Peggy Ashcroft in 1954.
MacLammoir, also wrote plays for the company and was a talented painter
designing several of their productions. Edwards, while wheeling and dealing
as the company's paternalistic artistic director and administrator, directed
the majority of their productions himself.
The Boys were both Londoners. Bobby Edwards was brought up in East Finchley,
son of an Indian civil servant. As a young man he had minor parts at the Old
Vic and was one of Ronald Frankau's Cabaret Kittens. Micheal MacLammoir, was
born Alfred Willmore. Aged 12 he played the young MacDuff in Beerbohm-Tree's
Macbeth and also appeared as a lost boy in Peter Pan the year Noel Coward
played Slightly. The manner in which he learnt to speak Irish, gave himself
a Celtic name and completely reconstructed his identity, claiming to have
been born in Cork, is material for a wonderful play he never wrote. But
someone should.
I once met Micheal MacLammoir, after I had been to see the Gate's production
in Dublin of St Joan with Siobhan MacKenna and I sampled his irresistible
charm. He had played the Earl of Warwick, now he entertained both me and
members of the company, with hilarious imitations of all the St Joans he had
seen from a stentorian Sybil Thorndike to a tiny squeaky Ludmilla Pitoeff.
Both he and Edwards learnt their job the hard way. They met as members of
the touring company run by the legendary Anew McMaster (later Pinter's
mentor). Orson Welles crops up at the Gate as a young hopeful aged 16, and
then years later as director of the film Othello in which Micheal
MacLammoir, played Iago (see his Put Money in Thy Purse). James Mason played
Brutus there and there were appearances by Cyril Cusack, Jimmy O'Dea, Brian
Friel (as one of their playwrights) and Eamonn Andrews.
The stormy relations between the Boys and the Earl of Longford - older
brother of the present one - are traced. Longford initially subsidised the
theatre entirely out of his own pocket and was on its board of directors,
but then formed his own company. The premises were shared, each company
occupying the theatre building for six consecutive months - an unhappy
arrangement that remained for many years.
The story has a happy ending, financially, with the Gate receiving, under
Charles Haughey's premiership in 1969, a government grant. Micheal
MacLammoir, made his own fortune with the international success of his one
man show about Oscar Wilde, and Hilton became first Head of Drama for Irish
television. But money was never really important to either of them except as
a means of furthering the work at the Gate. The only tiny mistakes I could
discover in this most interesting book were: Barrie was not a bachelor and
the Oxford bookshop is called Blackwell's.
Nick Hern, publisher of this book, was the editor at Methuen responsible for
their series of modern play texts that included the plays of Simon Gray,
John Mortimer, Michael Frayn, Edward Bond, Harold Pinter. He did not start
the series - that was the achievement of the late John Cullen way back in
the 1960s - but he greatly developed it. Then when Methuen was taken over in
1988, Hern broke away to start his own list. Several of the playwrights,
including Pinter, also left Methuen around that time; but they migrated to
Faber who in the late 1980s took over as our main publisher of play texts
for the ordinary reader.
Meanwhile Hern has kept his own imprint as a specialist publisher of
theatrical books and operates now from 14 Larden Road, London W3 7ST under
the logo - NHB. This year he says 'marks the emergence into full
independence of Nick Hern Books, the imprint I founded to publish all that's
best in the current theatre - and a few other things besides'.
Hern has formed an alliance with the Royal National Theatre and has
published Tony Kushner's Angels in America: Millennium Approaches and
Perestroika (the Aids epic currently playing to packed houses at the
Cottesloe). Hern and the NT have also recently published, or rather
re-published, 12 volumes of Granville Barker's Prefaces to Shakespeare at
Pounds 4.99 each. Richard Eyre says in a foreword that he regards Granville
Barker 'not only as the first modern English director but as the most
influential'. Barker's comments on Shakespeare remain relevant today.

JOURNEY TO LIVINGSTONE
by Timothy Holmes
Canongate Press Pounds 17.99, 366 pages
Umbopa, you will recall, announces in the closing pages of King Solomon's
Mines that he will permit no Europeans, and in particular neither traders
nor missionaries, to enter the African kingdom that he has recovered with
the help of Allan Quatermain and Sir Henry Curtis. Rider Haggard had
understood that the missionaries of Victorian times were not exclusively
concerned with the souls of their heathen flock. The most famous of them
all, David Livingstone, was a good example of such extracurricular
priorities; his brother-in-law, John Moffat, who gave up mission work to
become an important colonial servant, was another.
The most interesting element in Timothy Holmes' new biography, Journey To
Livingstone, is that it reveals how small a part the missionary vocation
played in the Scotsman's life. Nor did doctoring appear to play a larger
role. That is hardly surprising. From the time Livingstone arrived in 1841,
in what is today the Western Transvaal, he was obsessed with travel and
exploration and spent less and less time on his official duties for the
London Missionary Society - and you can hardly be an effective medical
missionary if you are tramping through the bush for years on end in search
of another lake or tributary. It is generally agreed that Livingstone made
only one convert in his first 12 years, and that one relapsed.
He made his name by 'discovering' Lake Ngami in 1848. Then, in two stages
between 1853 and 1856, he became the first white man to cross Africa, from
Luanda to Mozambique, and on the way 'discovered' and named the Victoria
Falls. (All this talk of discovery in the 'empty continent' is of course
nonsense: Holmes properly makes the point that the African inhabitants had
an adequate knowledge of the geography of their own regions. Livingstone's
greatest asset was that he was a good linguist and therefore could access
local expertise.)
With Missionary Travels and Researches in South Africa Livingstone was
created one of the great heroes of the Victorian age. Holmes is good on the
reasons why post-Crimean Britain was looking for a Christian paragon, though
parallels with a Christ figure seem a bit strong. There followed ten years
when Livingstone no longer seriously pretended to be a missionary but
concentrated on an irregular role as a roving British consul. The Zambesi
Expedition of 1858-64 was a disaster whose detail, well told here, must
always cast doubt on Livingstone's qualities - his judgment of men was
faulty (particularly his inclusion of his brother), his theory of the
navigability of the Zambesi was perverse, his choice of river steamer was an
error, and even his subsequent book was a failure - and it was left to HM
Stanley to 'rescue' Livingstone in more senses than one by reinventing the
myth of the saintly Dr Livingstone at Ujiji after the horrors of the Nile
Expedition of 1866-73. And then he was dead, and immortal, the body returned
to civilisation and to Westminster Abbey by his faithful servants, as we all
learn at our mother's knee.
Livingstone, as Holmes shows, was a driven man. It is never clear why. True,
he went to work in a cotton mill outside Glasgow at ten and hauled himself
up through the Scottish education system - but why this obsessive need to
leave the country, to travel far beyond the frontiers of Calvinist
settlement, to deny any priority to his mission or to his family (and to his
alcoholic wife Mary Moffat, who is a shadowy, tragic figure in the tale)?
The weakness of this book, beyond the scandalous inadequacy of its maps, is
that it never begins to convince us about the man's motivation. Its strength
is not so much the use of 'recently revealed' letters as the depth of its
background analysis.
Livingstone believed in the three 'Cs', Christianity, Commerce and
Civilisation: he was to add a fourth - Colonisation. In 1858 he was writing
of his hopes for 'an English colony in the healthy highlands of Central
Africa' (Umbopa was surely right]) but he had been looking for a suitable
territory for years before that - Barotseland? the Batoka plateau? the Shire
valley? His ideal seems to have been for a colony directed by a small
Christian elite where free labour would produce a cash crop for the benefit
of the natives thanks to export access to the sea. Hence his need to open a
route - east or west - to the ocean: hence the explorer. (Holmes points out
that this vision has parallels with earlier Jesuit blueprints, just as he
reminds us that Livingstone's support for the training of native African
catechists was closer to Jesuits like Francis Xavier than to his own fellow
missionaries.)
And slavery? He was realistic about the existence, and the permanence, of
domestic slavery in Africa, but he came to detest the export trade, and
there - symbolised by the closure of the Zanzibar market in 1873, the year
of his death - lies his memorial. He understood the relationship between
slavery and ivory, and came to think that the development of legitimate and
profitable commerce, a two-way process in in a colonial system, would cut
the ground from beneath the slave trade. Holmes puts it vividly: every
ivory-keyed pianoforte in Victorian England entailed one elephant killed and
two slaves to carry the tusks to the coast] The irony, well-appreciated for
years, is that during the last appalling years of wandering without
medicines in the bush, Livingstone's life was saved again and again by the
charity of passing Zanzibari slave traders.
'The end of the geographical feat is the beginning of the missionary
enterprise' was how Livingstone justified himself, though he might have put
it the other round. 'Dr L. is out of his mind' wrote his exasperated
companion John Kirk, later to become another notable colonial servant in
East Africa. A happier image of madness is 'Dr L' measuring the height of
the Victoria Falls: he took a canoe across the force of the current to a
tiny island overhanging the lip, then leaned over the 300-foot precipice and
lowered a length of rope. Some missionary]

FT  15 JAN 94 / Property: New lines of communication for commuters -
Transport priorities are increasingly influencing our choice of home
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Commuting is an American invention that is a century old and inseparable
from season tickets. The word referred first to people who bought
'commutation tickets' at a discount for a bulk buy, in true US fashion. It
had nothing to do with what we mean by commuting today - regular travel to
and from one's place of work in a city. But if commuting has changed its
meaning as a word, it is still about trains and season tickets, and dreams
of a place of one's own outside the city.
The railways transformed the south of England. Sussex, Surrey, Kent and
Hampshire became dormitories for London and a gardener's paradise where the
newly-discovered rhododendrons and azaleas flourished. Haywards Heath and
Burgess Hill, in mid-Sussex, would not exist but for the trains.
North of the Thames, the Metropolitan Railway (now the London Underground's
Metropolitan line) reached into Middlesex.
And, in this century, the Underground network spread above ground into
Essex, Hertfordshire and Buckinghamshire.
Londoners have become resigned to broken signals, ageing trains and failed
power supplies. Those difficulties, along with security alerts, mean that
you never know how long to allow for a journey on the Underground. Sometimes
it is quicker than you ever imagine but a decaying infrastructure and
inadequate investment bedevil the system. It is hard to know how committed a
'back-to-basics' government is to improving London's most basic need, public
transportation of a standard that should match any in the world.
While London Underground continues renewing escalators and rewiring, and
decides whether or not it will finish refurbishing Mornington Crescent on
the Northern line (please do), major improvements on the horizon will ease
congestion on existing lines and give more choice.
With luck, by the end of the century, the fast Channel Tunnel rail link to
Waterloo and Kings Cross or St Pancras will make Paris and Brussels less
than three hours away and Ashford in Kent 40 minutes instead of 70.
Paddington will be the terminus for an express shuttle to Heathrow (16
minutes) and for the east-west Crossrail line to Liverpool Street (via Bond
Street, Tottenham Court Road and Farringdon). Work has begun on extending
the Jubilee line to Westminster, Waterloo, London Bridge, Canary Wharf and
on to Stratford. Other expected improvements are: higher capacity on
Thameslink, British Rail's north-south through route linking Brighton,
Gatwick and points to Bedford; extensions to the Docklands Light Railway;
and perhaps the Chelsea-Hackney line (which would run from Wimbledon to
Leytonstone).
Few commuters, whether British Rail or Underground, can make a completely
detached decision on where to live, considering only the ease and cost of
getting to work. For most, the other variables are quite as important: how
near are they to grandparents, schools, rugby at Twickenham or opera at
Glyndebourne?
The Kent BR lines are notoriously slow. A friend moving from Canterbury to
Salisbury found it takes no more time to reach her place of work in central
London - even though Salisbury is much further away. But, when all the
decisions have been made about the Channel tunnel rail link, and the fast
trains are running, life might be different. If you like Kent, hang in
there.
In East and West Sussex, houses within three miles of Haywards Heath station
command a 10 per cent premium, says Stephen Hardwick, of Cluttons. That is
because there are frequent trains to both London Bridge for the City and
Victoria for the West End. If you miss one, there is always another. And as
the line suffers fewer delays than others in the area - autumn leaves are a
hazard on the Uckfield line - it is easy to make power breakfasts in London
or an 8am start in a City office.
That is harder to achieve if you commute in from Lewes, in East Sussex.
Lewes has fewer trains which take longer. Some Lewes folk drive to Gatwick,
leave their cars in the airport car park and then take the train.
If you want to live in Brighton, even though the non-stop Pullman train the
Brighton Belle no longer exists, there is a bonus. The season ticket costs
the same as from Haywards Heath.
Surrey is leading the climb back in the property market, just as it led the
recent decline. Haslemere is reputed to sell more first class season tickets
(annual cost Pounds 3,288) than any other station in the country. South
London will benefit from extending the Docklands Light Railway to Lewisham,
giving a direct link to Bank station, in the heart of the city.
For people living west of London the Paddington rail schemes may provide
major change. For example It will be far easier to reach the City via
Crossrail. For Buckinghamshire commuters the so-called Turbo trains, on the
Chiltern line to Marylebone, are fast and regular, but short on leg room.
The Underground's Metropolitan line is the alternative.
North of the capital Milton Keynes has three trains an hour to Euston, and
for a long-distance commuter Peterborough to Kings Cross is an hour. If you
plan to work in the in the City and live in the country, consider homes in
East Anglia. East Anglian trains arrive at Liverpool Street, from where it
is but a short walk to Bank station.
But is it healthy to spend so much time travelling? Is parking the wife and
children in suburbs or country a relic of the antediluvian days when women
did not work?
Before you decide to be a commuter think how much better a property you
could buy in London by putting the season ticket money into mortgage
payments.
A transmission error meant that the number of the National Energy Foundation
in Milton Keynes was given incorrectly last week. The correct number is:
0908-672787.

FT  15 JAN 94 / Gardening: Living on memories
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Those of you with rivers at the bottom of the garden now have gardens at the
bottom of the river. I am treating these rains as a finale, atmospheric
applause for a previous year which gardeners, like investors, are unable to
reproach. From January to January, we have all had a marvellous run. The
winters never really froze; once again, the witch hazels are stupendous, my
young yew hedge still has a brown complaint which is undiagnosed; these
rains may be tiresome, but I am living on memories of a marvellous 1993.
The first half-year of English Gardens plc turned in results which no
watcher could have predicted. My highlights were endless, from January to
June. Winter daphnes took a new turn for me with the discovery that Daphne
Bholua Jacqueline Postill will grow and flower madly for all of us, even on
lime, if we give it a south or west wall.
In late spring, another new arrival, the blue Corydalis flexosa has
established itself as a gardener's dream in the various forms which emerged
less than 10 years ago from China: the prices are now coming down and this
long-flowering plant for slight shade is within reach of all of us in 1994.
Among older favourites, magnolias and camellias were marvellous and Indigo,
the darkest forget-me-not, reminded me that it is better, though smaller,
than all the others. In April, the sight of the best blue Echium, the one
called webbii, in Tresco Gardens reminded me that it is the best of these
tall, tender forms for frost-free expatriates in the south Mediterranean.
In May, I made a note to buy the white-flowered Staphylea colchica because
its showers of flower and easy disposition seem to be ignored by most keen
gardeners. The spring had remained extremely dry, and suddenly we were
plunged into an accelerated heaven.
In early June we had the display of a lifetime which rolled an English June
and July into one and will live in the memory of anyone who had brought
their garden-visiting forwards by three weeks. We had pink old-fashioned
roses among the salvias of mid-July and the paeonies of early June. Careful
colour-planning went marvellously by the board and all those artful
combinations were overtaken by nature's decision to let it all show at once.
The half-year ended with a climax of old roses, better than ever because
they flowered so profusely and were undamaged by rain while at their best.
As usual, I gave the highest mark to the silver pink Fantin Latour, the
essential variety for any garden, although it has usurped the name of the
great flower painter and its origin remains an unsolved mystery.
As Fantin faded, the rain began and the intermittent cold brought the year
back into balance. At half-time, the one cloud in the report was the
condition of summer bedding-plants and sweet peas, recovering from a dry
start to their year. Confounding the experts they then prospered in the
third quarter.
Summer retained its own magic, despite the rushed results. I fell for
Diascia Blackthorn Apricot, whose flowers have a pale colour of rare
intensity. We will be seeing it all over the place in 1994 and as a low
grower, it may be hardy, although this winter has not tested it. Buy it when
you see it, along with seeds of the white venidiums, as easy as weed from
Thompson and Morgan and agreed to be the bedding-plant of the year.
By September, nobody could say that the second half had lost the momentum of
the first. The Japanese Anemones proved equal to all the oddities of the
season, reminding me that we should all grow these easy plants and not be
deterred by their slowness to settle down in the first year.
We had a foretaste of rain, making bulb-planting an ordeal. Against the
odds, autumn colour then emerged from the gloom of October and gave us 10
days of astounding beauty. The beech trees were more brilliant than ever and
I started to notice the flowers which swept my personal prizes in this year
of extraordinary riches.
Why are so many of us wary or unaware of the Schizostylis, the Kafir Lily of
South Africa? Their rounded flowers come in shades of white, pale pink,
strong pink and red and their startling clarity persists into November when
this obliging year brought the yellow-flowered Mahonia Charity forward to
meet them.
For years, books have put me off this late-flowering family by saying that a
Schizostylis must have shade or slightly sheltered conditions. I have put
mine in sun for the hottest part of the day but they are thriving and
growing like mad because they have found a root-run under nearby paving
stones and are completely satisfied with the odd soaking.
Beside a path or in gaps on a terrace, these late, bright lily-flowers seem
to be wonderfully obliging. Experienced growers now tell me that they need
water early in the year, from December until May and that this dampness
matters more than shade or temperature.
As the rains fall, our national pursuit may be a wash-out, but I'm telling
myself that my Schizostylis are quietly loving every sodden minute of it.

FT  15 JAN 94 / Motoring: Take the rough with the tough - How to take snow
and floods in your stride
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first spell of severe winter weather concentrates the mind about
four-wheel drives. People who already have one congratulate themselves on
their foresight.
And others who find themselves stuck on a snowy hill or stalled in a foot of
floodwater think that perhaps they really ought to have one next time.
I like to have an on-off road 4x4 on test at the turn of the year because if
my part of Kent is going to have a hard winter, this is usually when it
starts.
The market in these vehicles is still expanding and the variety on offer is
bewildering. This time, I chose a Jeep Cherokee Sport to be sure of staying
mobile during the Christmas and new year break.
Funnily enough, I still have not seen any snow this winter, apart from a
sprinkling in November, so the Jeep's four-wheel drive traction was not
needed. But its high clearance came in useful when the never-ending rain
flooded many minor roads. Knowing the Jeep could wade through water much
deeper than a normal car could cope with was a great confidence builder.
Outwardly, the Cherokee Sport looks the same as the Cherokee Limited but
instead of a four-litre in-line six-cylinder engine and automatic
transmission, it has a 2.6-litre four-cylinder and five-speed manual
gearbox.
Both Cherokee Limited and Sport are four-door estates in which four adults
sit comfortably on soft upholstery. A pair of labradors can travel in style
behind, although the large, internally-stowed spare wheel does cut into the
luggage space. Like the Cherokee Limited (from Pounds 18,995), the Pounds
15,995 Sport is exceptionally good value. Power steering, electric windows
and outside mirrors, plus remotely-controlled central locking are standard.
It is one of the most car-like on-off road 4x4s to drive, with a light - if
long throw - clutch pedal and a gearbox as easy to use as a family
hatchback's. The transmission is selectable; only the rear wheels are driven
unless extra traction is needed when four-wheel drive can be had in high or
low ranges.
By on-off road vehicle standards it rides and handles well, is effortless to
park and runs quietly.
Although the Sport is geared much lower than the 4-litre Cherokee Limited,
one has to shift fairly frequently because exhaust system vibration
discourages low speed in fourth or fifth. Fuel consumption averages about
22mpg (12.85 l/100km).
The Cherokee's styling is so restrained it is unlikely to frighten even
thoroughbred horses and I felt it would sit happily among the Range Rovers
and Fortnum's hampers at smart outdoor events. One could not say the same of
Toyota's showy on-off roader, the 4Runner, which would look more at home
pulling a flash looking powerboat than a couple of hunters.
The 4Runner, which has been sold on mainland Europe for some years, is based
on a pick-up truck. So is the Vauxhall (Opel) Frontera but whereas the
Frontera is cheap (from Pounds 13,445 for a 2-litre petrol-
engined 2-door Sport) the 4Runner is anything but. At Pounds 22,292 for the
three-litre petrol V6 (Pounds 23,211 for a three-litre, four-cylinder
turbo-diesel) it is priced closer to the Mitsubishi Shogun and well above
the class-leading Land Rover Discovery.
Toyota says by way of explanation that the 4Runner is aimed up-market of
Frontera. On and off road, it goes well - the diesel in particular because
its low-speed pulling power allows it to be driven almost as a one-gear car.
But the interior trim is unexciting and maximising load space has made the
rear seats quite cramped.
Volkswagen's Caravelle Syncro looks like a van because that it what it is; a
converted van with windows and up to eight seats. But forget the looks. It
drives like a car, rides beautifully, is massively roomy and has permanently
engaged all-wheel drive.
Though not a proper on-off road vehicle, it can tackle muddy paddocks and
rutted farm roads and would be ideal family ski-holiday transport. The
Pounds 22,936, 2.5-litre, 5-cylinder version I drove was a quiet and
comfortable motorway cruiser. Being box shaped, it was more parkable than it
looked and the high driving position was appreciated in town traffic.
I rate the Land Rover Discovery automatic diesel I am using now the best of
its kind. The 2.5-litre direct injection engine has class-leading economy
and fires up instantly on a sub-zero morning without the help of pre-heater
glow plugs. It is growly when accelerating, quiet when it gets into top and
the automatic transmission's shift quality is as good as you get in a luxury
car.
The up to seven-seat Discovery is just made for a country family needing a
roomy school bus-cum-shopping car during the week and something to carry a
shooting party's guns and gundogs at the weekend. It could not be easier to
drive and, if used sensibly, has an unusually modest thirst for a burly
on-off road 4x4 with two pedal control of around 27mpg (10.46 l/100km).
Automatic transmission, which adds Pounds 1,150 to the price, would be worth
every penny to many a Discovery owner who uses it as a daily on-road, mainly
urban or suburban runabout. But, being a Land Rover, it still has more
off-road capability than almost anyone could ask for, let alone really need.

FT  15 JAN 94 / Fishing: A view from the casting couch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM FORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In a distinctly non-vintage year for new fishing books, the best I have come
across, by some distance, is Trout Bum, by American writer John Gierach
(Robinson, Pounds 14.95).
To judge from the abysmal picture of him on the inside cover, the author is
a hairy, brawny wilderness man, and he writes of icy mountain lakes a day's
walk from anywhere; of crystal headwaters high in the lonely peaks; of camp
fires with coyotes for company. The style is literary - a touch
sub-Hemingway, you might think - but the prose is suffused with love for the
sport and deep knowledge of its traditions and lore. I would guess that
Gierach is a first-rate fisherman, but he has the good manners not to boast.
I liked him and his book very much.
Incomparably the most interesting volume I have seen is Dr CB McCully's A
Dictionary of Fly Fishing (Oxford University Press, Pounds 6.99). I know
nothing of the doctor but surmise he must be monstrously learned. Whether
your query concerns the character of oligotrophic water, the origin of the
Funneldun fly, or the genesis of the great nymph versus dry fly controversy,
the answer is here. All is expressed wittily and pithily and the whole thing
is a delight.
A Passion For Angling, by Chris Yates, Bob James and Hugh Miles (Merlin
Unwin/BBC, Pounds 16.99) is a pleasant reminder of the wonderful BBC
television series which ran this autumn. I have said before, and will say
again, that Yates is the best writer on fishing in the UK. The book is full
of delicious touches without seeing him entirely on top form.
I greatly enjoyed Roger Pierce's unpretentious and individual Fishing With
My Father (available at Pounds 14.95 from the Chiltern Agency, Kingston
Street, Chinnor, Oxon OX9 4NL). It is a beguiling narrative, woven around
his father's diaries and his own memories.
At the other end of the scale is Casting Far And Wide (David and Charles,
Pounds 17.99), a collection of adventures in far-flung parts compiled by
John Bailey. I have not actually read it, for the economy-conscious
publishers sent me no more than the dust jacket. But the references on that
to Balkan catfish, Danube salmon, the vast arapaima of Brazil and the mailed
mahseer of India made me eager for more.
If contemporary writing is going through the doldrums, the business of
exhuming the jewels of the past proceeds apace. It is led by Justin Knowles,
who is my nomination as publishing hero of the year.
His Fly Fisher's Classic Library continues to offer, in handsome reprints
and at reasonable cost, classics which previously could be found only by
assiduous skulkers around second-hand shops and delvers into specialist
catalogues (people like me, in fact).
The discovery of the year was James O'Gorman's The Practice Of Angling As
Regards Ireland. It was published in 1845 and, although I had heard of it, I
had never read it until Knowles sent me his reprint. The title might be a
touch cumbersome but the text is rollicking stuff - great stories, splendid
characters, and a vigorous and humorous style. At Pounds 67, it is a snip.
Like the others, it can be obtained from Dartmoor View, Mary Street, Bover
Tracey, Newton Abbot, Devon TQ13 9HQ.
Negley Farson's Going Fishing (Fly Fisher's Classic Library, Pounds 32) is
one of the deathless masterpieces. Farson was a seriously larger-than-life
individual: war correspondent, womaniser, drinker, tale-teller. He was a
habitual wanderer in wild and dangerous places and wherever he went - the
high valleys of the Caucasus, the Gulf of Finland, the Andean foothills, the
Dinaric Alps of Slovenia - he usually had a fishing rod with him. The
writing style is all his own: laconic, lean, passionate and memorable.
Like Farson, Arthur Ransome was a newspaper correspondent in Russia at the
time of the Bolshevik revolution. But Ransome's fishing pieces for the
Manchester Guardian - collected under the title Rod And Line (Fly Fisher's
Classic Library, Pounds 38) - have none of the border-hopping restlessness
of the American.
Ransome's territory is domestic; his tone reflective, philosophical and
inquiring. He roves where he wills over matters such as the wisdom of carp,
the traditions of northern fly dressing, the piscatorial side-effects of an
eclipse and the uncertain temper of bulls.
The book is one of my absolute favourites. My only regret about this edition
 -a substantial one - is that, unlike others, it does not include Ransome's
translation of the exquisite work of Sergei Aksakov, whom Ransome called the
first and most delightful of Russian writers on fishing. It is well worth
hunting down a second-hand copy in the old Traveller's Library; it should
cost no more than a pound or two.

FT  15 JAN 94 / Travel: The wild west lives in Australia's centre - Nicholas
Woodsworth rides with lean and mean John Brack, a fine example of Outback
Man
</HEADLINE>

IT WAS chilly and raining when the Ghan pulled into Alice Springs, in the
middle of Australia. Beside the railway tracks, in the empty,
wine-box-littered bed of the Todd river, where they camp, ragged and
barefoot Aboriginals hugged themselves for warmth.
In town, runnels of water made dirty red maps on the sides of dust-coated
cars. Outside the pubs, dogs crouched bedraggled and patient in the back of
pick-up trucks. Alice seemed a sodden sort of place. This was not the
outback I had imagined.
Perhaps I had been too much influenced by the train brochures I had read.
The Ghan, I learned, was named for the Afghan cameleers who had been brought
in last century to open up the 1,100km transport route across the outback
from Adelaide, on the southern coast of the continent, to Alice in its red
centre. The train follows the same route.
Why Afghan cameleers? Because tough, wily, desert Afghans were best equipped
to survive travel in this vast and inhospitable area. Who better than men of
the desert to cope with endless spaces of rock and sand and sparse bush,
with blinding sun and brain-addling heat?
Not only were they tough but, Moslems, they were the only men in the country
who did not drink like fish; they alone could be trusted to bring liquor
supplies through to the stockmen and miners, the traders and homesteaders in
the thirsty bars of the interior.
The frontier atmosphere, the isolation, the harshness of the land and the
thick-skinned durability of the people who live there, appealed to me. In
the sprawling cities and suburbs of the south I had seen the way 90 per cent
of Australians live.
The suggestions of beer commercials to the contrary, few Aussies today have
to cope with giant spiders in backyard dunnies. The place where man
heroically confronts nature, once central to the character of every
Australian, now lies far to the north in the remote heart of the continent.
A few days spent camping and riding there would, I thought, provide an
antidote to urban life. Heat and dryness I had anticipated; no one had
mentioned the danger of floods or freezing to death. But then, it seems, the
outback is a place that breeds all kinds of extremes.
No one was complaining about the weather at the Ross River Homestead, a
simple but comfortable outback resort an hour's drive from Alice along the
edge of the rocky MacDonnell range. For the last three years the vast cattle
stations that make up the region have suffered severe drought. The hardiest
of grasses died off, dams and tanks dried up, and cattle had to be trucked
south to richer grazing lands.
None of this was apparent from the guest bungalows sitting below the sharp
ridge of iron-red rock that faces the Ross River. Beyond a paddock shared by
a flock of squawking, pink-crested galahs and half-a-dozen slowly ruminating
camels, the bush stretched away fresh and green. Young leaves were swelling
and the ground was soft and green. In the three weeks since it had begun
raining, the bush had been transformed.
Without a searing sun and at least a sand dune or two, a camel-ride seemed
somehow inappropriate. Instead, the chilly weather begged a bracing and
energetic outing on horseback. Early the next morning I was sitting astride
Nibbler, a chestnut gelding, and setting off for the hills in the company of
lean, mean, cowboy-hatted John Brack.
Was the entire Ross River outfit staffed, for the sake of authenticity, by
characters who might have wandered in off a Crocodile Dundee set? It seemed
so to me. There were any number of horsemen who might have accompanied me on
my ride: Ian, a blue-eyed Paul Hogan look-alike who, in desperado fashion,
sloped around the homestead in boots and an ankle-length oil-skin coat;
Grub, an energetic young ringer, or cowboy, whose work around camp-fires and
horse paddocks left him permanently dirt-caked from head to toe; Froggie, a
beer-bellied, ear-ringed ex-miner whose tattooed biceps and forearms danced
with naked ladies. Each one a strong personality in his own right, all have
been shaped by life in the bush. In the end, though, John Brack proved a
fine example of Outback Man.
With his cowboy boots, denim jacket, dangling cigarette and
cockatoo-feathered hat, Brack might have walked out of a Marlboro ad. He has
spent most of his life working on horseback. But he is too genuine a product
of his environment to fit the slick and disingenuous advert image.
His smile proves it. Six years ago he fell under a kicking horse at a rodeo.
When he woke after three months in a coma, his jaw had been broken in eight
places and there were 40 stitches and a metal plate holding it together. His
grin is no less broad today, but the front teeth remaining are few and far
between.
No matter how kicked around by outback life, Brack, like most locals,
professes a profound dislike for the city. He cannot stand its ways and what
he sees as its hypocrisy. He hates yuppies, he says, and cannot understand
foreigners. There is not enough room in the city to feel free, he will tell
you; and John Brack needs plenty of room.
He talks and acts bluntly. He will give you his last cent if you need it,
but if you transgress his code of rough justice you are likely to wind up
with a fist in your face. Today, with no family responsibilities, he moves
from job to job, drinks and smokes heroically, and refuses to respect any
kind of authority. Brack may not be a typical outbacker, but this is a place
where outsiders, rebels, misfits, black sheep and eccentrics have always
thrived.
Heat, boredom, isolation, aboriginal/white racial grievances, a shortage of
women, an extremely high level of alcoholic consumption - all contribute to
a frontier mentality that has all but vanished on Australia's periphery.
One figure tells it all: in the Northern Territory, the vast and sparsely
inhabited state stretching from Alice Springs north to tropical Darwin, the
murder rate is 14 times higher than the national average. The wild west
lives on in the Australian centre.
But life in the outback is not all drifting, drinking brawling and bravado.
Most of it is sheer work, the forcing of a living from an ungiving
environment. Having ridden miles through the morning with John Brack, I
found myself on the edge of the Love's Creek cattle station and talking to
its hard-working general manager, Aboriginal Henry Blomfield.
At 1.5m acres, Love's Creek is only a moderately-sized station (Anna Creek
station, to the south, is 12m acres). Nonetheless, just keeping an eye on
the 6,000 head of cattle that graze the range here is a full-time job. When
I met him, Blomfield was especially busy: he was halfway through the annual
muster, the round-up of the 1,300 cattle he must sell each year to keep the
station profitable.
Blomfield remembers days as a child on Love's Creek when cattle were
mustered solely by stockmen on horseback. Today his men still use horses in
the rough terrain, but also four-wheel-drive trucks, off-road motor-bikes,
and a helicopter. The hours, none the less, remain long and the work tiring.
Would he or his men care for an easier job in the city? I asked Blomfield
over a lunch-time meal of Love's Creek beef brisket and tea stewed in a
billy tin over a fire. Never, he replied. As far as he is concerned the
outback life is the only life. Certainly it is not the money that attracts
the stockmen, both white and Aboriginal, to the cattle stations: they
generally earn as much in a week as Blomfield's helicopter pilot does in an
hour.
We did not stay to watch. John Brack had some mustering of his own to do. By
late afternoon we were back at the homestead and collecting half-a-dozen
Ross River guests for an overnight ride and camping trip.
The weather changed as we rode out. Before sunset, the sky had turned a
startlingly clear, dustless blue, and luminous sunshine was glowing on every
bush and ghost gum tree and ancient ochre rock in the valley. Unconcerned,
kangaroos hopped and browsed just yards from our single file of horses. By
the time we arrived at our campsite, an open, grassy spot at the base of a
dramatic rockface, Grub had a fire going, Froggy was cooking dinner, and the
stars were out.
After dinner, around the fire, Grub described how he had once been stuck in
his car in a mud wallow for three days. Froggy told us it was all right to
punch a woman as long as she punched you first. John Brack admitted he had
once cleared a Darwin pub by passing through it with a live chain saw and
slicing off the legs of bar stools as he went. The stories continued, wild
tales of bull hunters and crocodile catchers, crazed opal miners and drunken
helicopter musters. Just occasionally I glanced up to the night sky to see
the Southern Cross wheeling overhead.

FT  15 JAN 94 / Travel: Off the beaten track in London Docklands - Peter
Marsh seeks some of the capital's hidden jewels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Anyone who is in London and looking for something different should head for
Stave Hill. Although it is only a little over two miles from the Bank of
England, in the heart of the City, the hill is well off the beaten track and
a marvellous place from which to view the capital.
Stave Hill is an artificial mound in the middle of what were Surrey Docks -
now mainly filled in as part of the Pounds 10bn Docklands development
programme. From the top you can see the tall buildings of the City to the
north-west, the smooth brutality of Canary Wharf on the Isle of Dogs to the
east, gently sprawling Victorian suburbs to the south, much bland, although
not completely soul-less 1980s housing all around, and - the real star - the
grey, restless waters of the Thames snaking away on both sides.
Stave Hill, especially on a cold, misty winter's day, is far from beautiful.
But it is a convenient place while on a walking tour of Docklands to pause,
look around and try to understand London.
Much has been written about how Docklands - 8.5 square miles that take in
Wapping and the easterly Royal Docks as well as the Isle of Dogs and Surrey
Docks - has been ruined by lack of planning and good architecture. Critics
of quick-built dross can have a field day.
But such complaints miss the point that, throughout its history, London has
rarely seen much planning and has witnessed a great deal of bad building.
Even so, the extraordinary diversity of the capital means there is much to
admire. And so it is in Docklands: seeking out the jewels requires some
effort.
To explore a representative segment of the area on both south and north of
the river you will need a day to spare, good shoes and the ability to
refocus your mind on a part of London far from fashionable.
A good place to start is the FT's headquarters on the south side of
Southwark Bridge. From here you can meander through a maze of Victorian
streets to the sturdy 18th century St George's Church standing on the
borders of Borough and Bermondsey. A few minutes' walk along Long Lane takes
you to a scruffy car park where Bermondsey Abbey stood for about 500 years
until it was demolished in the 16th century.
There should be time for a brief tour of the local leather works, erected in
the last century though sadly dilapidated, before heading off along Spa Road
to the old Peak Freans biscuit factory and Southwark Park - a pleasantly
laid-out tribute to Victorian public spirit which was opened in 1869 on the
site of marshland.
Now you can explore Surrey Docks - formerly a collection of artificial
inlets and ponds dug out mainly in the 19th century. Most of the docks have
been built over, but Greenland Dock and South Dock are intact and Russia
Dock, immediately to the south of Stave Hill, has been turned into parkland,
reminiscent of what the area as a whole looked like before industrialisation
took over in the 18th and 19th centuries.
Before getting too caught up in tracing the sites of the old docks, for
which you need curiosity and an old map, you should branch off to the
ancient village of Rotherhithe, squeezed between the 1980s developments and
the river.
Rotherhithe is a bit the worse for wear but has charm. Look out for the 18th
century St Mary's Church - the four pillars inside are made not from stone
but from tree trunks - and the Mayflower pub near where the Pilgrim Fathers
left for America in 1620.
A short detour takes you back westwards for a mile along the river, past the
evocatively named King's Stairs and Cherry Garden Pier, for a walk around
Shad Thames. This still contains many of the warehouses constructed when the
Thames was the world's busiest waterway.
Retracing your steps to Greenland Dock, make for Deptford and the Pepys
council estate, surrounding some victualling buildings which were a feature
of the famous royal dockyards built by Henry VIII in the 16th century.
Continuing east you go through a shabby riverside thoroughfare called
Stowage - don't stop unless you want to buy some spare parts from the car
scrapyards which line the route - before reaching Greenwich. Here you take
the pedestrian tunnel under the Thames to the Isle of Dogs on the north
bank.
Until 200 years ago, the area (not an island but a peninsula in a loop of
the Thames) contained hardly anything but a few wharves and windmills and a
lot of mud. Then came the great phase of dockbuilding, followed by the
mega-development of the past decade with its brave, brassy buildings, many
of them looking impossibly flimsy and destined to last not much beyond the
early years of next century.
Be sure to inspect the sad-looking, early-20th century housing around the
area's perimeter, and walk over the Mudchute, the local park built up from
solidified silt dredged out of the Millwall Docks in the 1890s.
The outline of the new buildings framed against the water of the docks -
which the developers have largely left alone - and the sky are often
spectacular. However, the best view is from the parcel of land just west of
Canary Wharf overlooking the river.
Ignore the not-quite-finished buildings and the piles of rubble signalling
their hasty abandonment. Concentrate on looking out at the setting sun, the
remnants of the Rotherhithe wharves opposite, and the calm of Limehouse
Reach stretching towards the City.
It is a place to reflect that, often, the best and worst of London can be
focused on the same spot.

FT  15 JAN 94 / Travel: Few seek out Qatar's riches
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEOFFREY WESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Doha, capital of the oil state of Qatar, does not receive many visitors
these days. In the oil-boom years, which faded in the early 1980s, foreign
businessmen streamed in to sell their wares and services. Now that the
capital has been rebuilt to the highest standards and the services are
generally second to none, most businessmen go elsewhere.
On a map, Qatar appears like a swollen thumb jutting northwards into the
waters of the Gulf - 100 miles long and 44 miles wide, a small appendage to
the vast Saudi Arabian hinterland. Its oil and natural gas have taken it
from rags to riches.
After Kuwait's experience at the hands of Saddam Hussein, there is safety in
reminding the world that Qatar, too, is an independent state. Tourism is one
way of doing this. In the last year or so, international sports tournaments
 -tennis, squash and sailing - have helped establish the idea of Qatar as a
safe and relaxing place.
For me, there are two good reasons for going there apart from the warm
winter climate. One is the award-winning National Museum (conceived by the
British firm, Michael Rice and Company); the other is the Doha Sheraton, my
favourite hotel in the Middle East.
Nowhere else have I seen a museum that captures a sense of national identity
so brilliantly. In a couple of hours, visitors can grasp not only what makes
this little country tick but also what life is - or was - about, up and down
the Gulf coast, from pre-history to the oil age. You can learn about cooking
methods and pearl diving, bedouin life and boat-building, oil and Islam.
The museum is based on the modest palace, built in days of still-remembered
poverty, where the present Emir was born. Connecting walls have given way to
gravel paths, desert flowers, shady trees and a carefully-integrated new
block. Beyond the new block is a colourful aquarium and a yacht basin for
traditional wooden vessels that swarm with children at weekends.
At the other end of the social scale is a little old house probably built
for a pearl diver. Now the ethnographical museum, it offers a more vivid
idea of domestic life as it was until recently.
Doha is built around a crescent-shaped bay, its skyline dominated by the
Sheraton, which soars majestically. The Dollars 150m hotel was built by the
government for an Opec conference and for hosting Arab summits. Making a
profit and attracting visitors are secondary considerations, however, since
the hotel is a national status symbol.
What never fails to excite me is its extraordinary architecture and setting.
This three-cornered pyramid is based on the idea of a tent, with
coloured-glass lifts soaring up a marble-clad 'tent pole'.
'You want to go to goo?' my ever-helpful Bangladeshi driver asked, knowing I
had a couple of hours to spare. 'What's there?' I asked weakly. 'Lion,
tiger, monkey - very nice.' We went to the goo. But it was family day and
the policeman was not convinced that the driver and I constituted a family.
Instead, we drove west from Doha to see the Emir's herd of rare Arabian
oryx. Rearing these graceful antelopes is his personal contribution to
wildlife conservation.
You would hardly choose Qatar for the scenery. One stretch of flat desert is
the same as another - except, that is, for the mountainous dunes near the
Inland Sea in the far south. Best of all, make friends with an expat family
and join a weekend camping party that will give you the chance to see the
dunes at their most dramatic, at sunrise or sunset.

FT  15 JAN 94 / Travel: Anything goes on Tahoe's slippery slopes - Skiing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARNIE WILSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Devil or Angel - an old 1960s potboiler - was playing on the car radio as
our Chevy rolled into South Lake Tahoe . . . Las Vegas on ice. The song
might have been written specially to describe this tinseltown sprawled
across the state line between California and Nevada.
This is where the good, the bad, the ugly, the magnificent, the seedy, the
spectacular and the kitsch finally meet in one extraordinary, vibrant
melting pot.
No matter how long the drive has been - in our case 10 hours - or how tired
you might be, as you nose through the glare, the flashing neon lights that
illuminate the lakeside gambling hotels also fire up an energy transfusion.
All thoughts of snuggling into a king size bed suddenly evaporate.
The Nevada side of Lake Tahoe, where you can gamble 24 hours a day, is not
designed for sleep.
If it were not for the cold shock of a million artificial crystals blasting
you in the face from one of America's biggest snow-making systems, you might
never wake up properly even on the mountain, which would be regrettable
since you would miss the breathtaking views from Heavenly across this huge
cobalt blue lake.
This year, as it nears its 40th birthday, Heavenly Valley, as it was
originally called when 19th century settlers found 'heavenly relief' from
the valley heat, has finally dropped the 'valley' and is now plain Heavenly.
What is unique about the mountain, apart from the quite extraordinary views
of Lake Tahoe on one side and the Nevada desert on the other, is that you
actually ski in both states.
Most people start the day at the Californian-based lodge where the tram
takes you to mid-mountain. From there you can ski to the bottom of the
recently installed Sky Express high-speed quad which whips you to the top of
Monument Peak at more than 10,000ft.
From there you can either glide back down on any number of fast blue
cruising trails - pausing, as you are bound to, in order to gaze out on the
shimmering lake - venture via the likes of Big Dipper, Comet and Stagecoach
into naughty Nevada where gambling, prostitution and just about anything
else goes.
Most of the mountain is intermediate cruising, although in good snow years
(so far this is not one, but last year was superb) there is an abundance of
excellent powder skiing among the trees.
Mott and Killebrew Canyons on the Nevada side, with runs such as Snake Pit
and Ramarrah's, provide a swashbuckling back country area for experts.
There is nothing like Lake Tahoe anywhere else in the American West. The
lake is magnificently beautiful; the huge gambling areas, nightly cabaret
spots and neon lit razzmatazz magnificently gaudy.
It is almost a relief to escape to Squaw Valley where the lake is over the
hills and far away (though still visible) and the volume and the lights of
everyday living have been discreetly turned down.
At Squaw, the venue for the 1960 Winter Olympics, you have six mountains to
choose from, including some of the toughest terrain in Tahoe. Beginners love
it here too because, unusually, the nursery slopes are perched high on
Emigrant Peak which means they can ride the tram and even ski all the way
down at the end of the day if they have enough skill or gumption.
Squaw, for years without much in the way of local lodging, now has an
excellent base resort where skiers are pampered in luxurious surroundings
without a flashing neon sign to be seen.
With good reason, Squaw and Heavenly are the best known of the Tahoe resorts
but there is a wealth of other ski areas - 15 in all - circling the lake.
Even if you have a fortnight here you will never get round to them all. Try
to find time, however, for Kirkwood, off the beaten track south of the lake,
where there is some steep, invigorating terrain with a craggy, wild west
movie backdrop, and Mount Rose, now linked with its neighbour, Slide
Mountain. Between them they have a good mix of challenging gradients and
exhilarating tree skiing that should bring a smile to most skiers' faces.
Diamond Peak at Incline Village has good family skiing and views of Lake
Tahoe that rival even those from Heavenly.
Heavenly's first skier was a postman called John 'Snowshoe' Thompson.
Snowshoe's 90-mile mail route carried him from Hangtown (now Placerville) in
California's gold country, over Monument Peak Pass, down the Nevada slopes
of Heavenly to Genoa, Nevada's first settlement.
As the local tourist office points out: 'Lucky Snowshoe must have gotten
some unbelievable first tracks]'
Arnie Wilson's visit to Lake Tahoe was arranged by Virgin Holidays, Sussex
House, High Street, Crawley, West Sussex, RH10 1BZ. Tel: 0293-617181. He
stayed at the Horizon Casino, Lake Tahoe, California.

FT  15 JAN 94 / Sport: Championship on the line - A look at the key tactical
battles in today's international at Cardiff / Rugby Union: The Five Nations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEREK WYATT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Five Nations Championship opens this afternoon with France (the
champions) playing rejuvenated Ireland, and Wales (the holders of the wooden
spoon) entertaining Scotland in Cardiff. These games will provide an early
test of how much the coaches have learnt from last season's experience with
the new laws.
This is the second year since the changes. Two changes have proved
particularly significant. The first is that if a penalty is kicked into
touch, the team doing the kicking is awarded the throw-in. As the number of
penalties has grown this has put a premium both on the line kicker, who
cannot afford to miss touch, and the line-out. Win the line-out and you win
the match.
The second-row forwards must now be better line-out performers than
scrummagers. The hooker must throw in better than he can hook. It does not
matter (as the French have shown) who throws in, as long as they throw
accurately.
Throwing has changed too. The two hookers in Cardiff today, Garin Jenkins
and Ken Milne take the ball behind their head (and therefore out of their
line of sight). Darts players throw from in front of their face and it makes
sense for hookers to follow suit, as does Sean Fitzpatrick, the New Zealand
captain.
The French won the first Test against Australia in October but this was a
fluke because they lost the line-outs. If the Welsh second row pairing of
Phil Davies and Gareth Llewellyn out-play the new cap, Shade Munro and the
old stager, Neil Edwards, as they should do, then Wales should win.
From the line-out the object is to cross the imaginary gain-line as close to
the forwards as possible. This has meant that all three back-row players and
the scrum-half try to batter their way through the first line of defence.
Expect endless variations on this theme from the Scottish trio of Derek
Turnbull, Robert Wainwright and Iain Morrison. The key is to make sure that
the ball comes back on your side.
When their teams win this position, the fly-halves, Gareth Jenkins and Craig
Chalmers will hoof the ball up in the air - the 'bomb' in rugby league, the
more prosaic Garryowen in union. When the ball comes down a defender will
catch it surrounded by the opposition who will make sure the ensuing maul or
ruck is inconclusive so their team wins the put-in at the scrum. This change
in the laws has altered the very nature of the game.
Wales have no players of sufficient individual brilliance to win matches on
their own. Scott Quinnell, Rupert Moon and Neil Jenkins at number eight,
scrum-half and fly-half respectively have to hold the side together. Jenkins
is having a fine season at club level but has struggled in his 17
internationals (much as Rob Andrew did during his first 20 caps). Wales so
badly need a fly-half. I hope it is his day.
The only certainty about Scotland is that they will turn up for the game.
They will need to experiment early on in the line-out by shortening them and
must not be afraid to run the ball from deep positions. Too often they have
waited until the last quarter of the game before gambling and too often they
have depended on Gavin Hastings' place kicking abilities.
Wales and Scotland fear failure and will keep their tactics simple. Both
teams will kick for yardage again and again. Wales must win. Scotland cannot
afford to lose.

FT  15 JAN 94 / Sport: Sampras serves notice - The Australian open starts on
Monday. John Barrett sees the men's world No 1 full of confidence on and off
the court / Tennis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARRETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The world number one was unusually outspoken. 'I have come here to win the
Australian Open. I will be satisfied with nothing less,' said Pete Sampras
at Peters New South Wales Championships in Sydney, where he powered his way
through to today's final.
His opponent in that final, Ivan Lendl was less forthcoming. Refusing to be
drawn into making a forecast about the likely winner of the ADollars 8m
(Pounds 3.6m) championship, the first grand slam event of the year which
begins at the National Tennis Centre in Melbourne on Monday, the former
world champion grew tired of parrying the questions and said mischievously:
'OK - I'll go out on a limb . . . Steffi Graf]'
Sampras and Graf will rightly be strong favourites to win the main titles at
Flinders Park. Yesterday's draw has thrown Sampras and Lendl together again.
If they both survive as they should (and only Lendl's stamina over five sets
at the age of 33 in the intense heat makes that uncertain), then we could
enjoy another minor classic. Lendl seems to have regained his zest for the
game. He is moving more quickly, serving magnificently (a record 28 aces
against the unfortunate Richey Reneberg who is likely to be his second round
opponent in Melbourne) and making fewer unforced errors than last year.
Sampras, too, has found his form. There was a scare on day three when, after
leading 6-1 4-0 against Jason Stoltenberg he found himself a service break
down in the final set. Against Aaron Krickstein on Thursday and Petr Korda
yesterday, Sampras looked every inch the world's best.
He was keen to beat Korda to gain revenge for a particularly painful loss to
the left-handed Czech in the last tournament of 1993, the Compaq Grand Slam
Cup. In that gruelling 4 1/2 -hour semi-final, one of the most dramatic
matches I have seen, Sampras was tottering about like a punch drunk boxer
and Korda writhing on the court with cramp. Sampras failed to convert any of
the five match points he held and eventually surrendered 13-11 in the final
set, totally spent and physically sick.
That defeat came at the end of a wonderful year in which the American won
eight tournaments, including a first title at Wimbledon and a second at the
US Open. Sampras was already sure of his No 1 ranking when he suffered his
only loss in a final - to the new German hero, Michael Stich at the IBM /
ATP Tour Championship.
Sampras had not intended to defend his title in Sydney because he felt last
year that he had played too many matches by the time he lost to Stefan
Edberg in the semi-final of the Australian Open.
But a first round loss last week in Doha to the little known Moroccan, Karim
Alami, a player ranked below 200, caused him to change his mind. The manner
of that loss was worrying. Sampras led by a service break in the final set
before 'choking on his lead', according to a reliable eye witness. This rude
shock prompted Sampras to ask for a wild card into the Sydney draw. Even the
best laid plans of mice and millionaires must sometimes be modified.
Jim Courier, who has won the Australian Open for the last two years, has
dropped to No 3 in the rankings and has been drawn in the same half as
Sampras. If these two do meet in the semi-finals expect a battle royal.
Courier is convinced that he would have won their Wimbledon final against a
fading Sampras if only he had captured the fourth set.
The new No 2, Stich, has first Korda and then Edberg in his path. Edberg
comes fresh from success in Doha and seems to have found his service rhythm
at last. If he has, then he may be the man Stich has to watch. In their
Grand Slam Cup semi-final Edberg recaptured his 1988 form. Can he still
stretch that form over five sets, that is the question?
The women's title seems wide open for Graf. The stabbing of Monica Seles
last April removed the only player capable of beating Graf regularly. In her
absence Graf duly annexed the last three grand slam titles of 1993 to bring
her total to 14.
The game has been robbed of a rivalry that promised to equal those other
historic rivalries - Wills v Jacobs, Brough v Connolly, Court v King, Evert
v Navratilova - that have been central to the game's evolution. Their final
here last year, won by Seles 4-6 6-3 6-2, was one of the great contests of
1993.
When these two will next meet is a matter of conjecture.
Seles, ever the perfectionist, has been training and practising hard but
will pick her moment so that she can be certain of returning with a win. The
latest communique suggests that she might decide to emerge next month,
probably in the US.
Although 27 of the top 30 women are here, with Seles, Martina Navratilova
and Jennifer Capriati all absent the draw does look thin. It is worrying
that there are so few young players capable of challenging the leaders. With
Graf in the top half is fellow German, Anke Huber, who gave Seles a hard
match here two years ago. Her coach Boris Breskvar (he was Boris Becker's
original coach) told me that she is now capable of beating Steffi. Whether
or not that is wishful thinking we may soon discover.
In the lower half the effervescent Spaniard, Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario is
seeded No 2 for the first time. She may have a tough quarter-final against
Manuela Maleeva-Fragniere who retires from the circuit after this
championship and wants to go out with a bang.
If Sanchez survives she may face Gabriela Sabatini in the semi-finals. The
Argentinian has reappointed her original coach, Carlos Kirmayr of Brazil. I
do not envy him the task of revitalising a player who has not won a
tournament since the 1992 Italian Open and whose serve seems to be getting
worse rather than better.
Elsewhere the talent cupboard seems to be bare. No, if Graf is not to win it
then I cannot suggest who might. Please hurry back Monica, please.

FT  15 JAN 94 / Sport: A change in view - A look at the battle over
television money / Rugby Union: Television Contract
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEREK WYATT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
English rugby's governing body, the Rugby Football Union, has decided that
it will not go it alone in the current television negotiations for the Five
Nations championship. The RFU's executive committee met yesterday afternoon
and decided to present a united front with its counterparts from Ireland,
Wales and Scotland.
Rugby's television contract from September 1, 1994 is for sale and as rugby
is a sport of political intrigue, the debate about who will win has caused
much commotion and emotion off the field. War broke out on the four home
unions television sub-committee when the RFU suggested that the traditional
equal split of everything needed reassessing.
The problem is that the French Federation de Rugby already has its own deal
for the Five Nations and for years has received more money than any of the
four home unions. The RFU was tempted to follow the French example.
At least yesterday's meeting means there will be an equal split of the
television revenues, but from only the domestic rights of the Five Nations
Championship. 'We're still thinking of a three-year deal,' said Dudley Wood,
the RFU secretary, 'but we wouldn't rule out a five-year option if the money
was right.'
When the Five Nations Championship television contract was last put out to
tender, three years ago, there were two bidders: ITV and BBC. ITV was
confident that having secured the 1991 Rugby World Cup it would win the Five
Nations as well. It did not. The BBC bid Pounds 10m which the four home
unions split equally.
But it was not quite that equal. Sport is not taxed in the Irish Republic,
so the Irish RFU's Pounds 2.5m is tax free. Wales' share was augmented by a
Pounds 1m contract with BBC Wales for club rugby.
The Four home unions need large amounts of cash. The English, Scots and
Irish are rebuilding their stadia. All are following England's lead in
expanding their infrastructure.
If a broadcaster came up with a generous five-year offer, the four home
unions would be compelled to take it. There are also signs that the RFU's
loyalty to the BBC may be wavering. 'We will have to go to the highest
bidder,' said Wood. 'We have the Twickenham West Stand to rebuild.'
For the first time, Sky Sports will be a contender. Sky follows Rupert
Murdoch's philosophy of using big sports events to build viewing figures.
Murdoch's Fox Network in the US has just paid Dollars 1.6bn (Pounds 1.1bn)
for NFL Football and has already made a play for the 1998 Winter and 2000
Summer Olympics. If Sky bids for world rights for the Five Nations for the
next five years it could push the price above Pounds 60m.
England's argument for more of the cake is irrefutable. Its team is the box
office draw and Twickenham was full for the London Division game against the
All Blacks, and the Varsity Match established a new record for a club game.
Wales could not sell out its fixture against Canada; Ireland failed to fill
Lansdowne Road for its game against Romania.
In order to attract the highest price the home unions will have to make
their fixture schedule more attractive. They can introduce a season-opening
fixture, for example a President's XV v a World XV (with the gate going to a
rugby charity; an idea that has been considered and turned down by
Twickenham). The Barbarians game could be moved to the beginning of all
tours and make way for a Lions match at the end. The Five Nations matches
could be played on both Saturdays and Sundays and moved nearer to the end of
the season to allow club and provincial rugby to breathe.
The four home unions sub-committee has been slow to understand the changes
in the media since the last television contract was negotiated. It simply
cannot afford to get it wrong this time.

<TEXT>
Arnie Wilson's trip around the world, on which he aims to ski every day in
1994 and to notch up 5,000 miles on the slopes, is proving such big news in
North America that he and his companion Lucy Dicker, are struggling to find
time to ski.
He reports: 'When we reached Pebble Creek, near Pocatello in Idaho, three TV
crews were waiting for us. In the gathering dusk they were torn between
interviewing us and filming us skiing. There was just enough light for one
run - a steep mile of scratchy moguls - and my fall at the end was gleefully
captured on camera.
'That night, the potato state was treated to TV pictures of Wilson on the
deck . . .'
There is still time to win a skiing holiday for two in Zermatt or runner-up
prizes of champagne by entering the competition which appeared in Weekend FT
on January 1 (copies available from the FT shop, tel: 071-873 3324).

FT  15 JAN 94 / Fashion: Glamour and warmth in thermal underwear - Vests and
long johns can be shown off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The whole point of underwear is, of course, that it was designed to be worn
under the real McCoy, the clothes in which we present ourselves to the
world. Of late, though, it has been a commonplace that what was once kept
hidden is proudly revealed. British Vogue, in its January issue, goes so far
as to show a photograph of the perfectly formed Kelly Klein (wife of Calvin)
wearing . . . guess what . . . to a party in New York? A thermal vest. Not
an embroidered bustier or a frilly bit of froth but a sensible (though
sleeveless) thermal vest. And she was not wearing it underneath anything, it
was what passed for her only top.
Anybody who feels they might look equally fetching going to parties in
thermal vests is spoilt for choice. So, too, are those who may want them for
rather more mundane reasons, such as feeling a little on the chilly side.
Thermal wear, I should hasten to say, has no precise meaning - it simply
stands for something light and warm and indeed it is its lightness in
relation to the warmth it offers that is thermal clothing's best asset.
The best skinny little numbers can be hidden away under jackets, silk
shirts, evening dresses and supply warmth without bulk. Their very
skinniness makes them perfect with jeans, with the new season's drawstring
pants (to minimise the bulk around the waist), or, with just a little bit of
lace edging peeping out from under a jacket, under a silk shirt or a
cashmere cardigan.
Damart, possibly the most famous of all the thermal clothing suppliers, goes
in for a special fibre of its own - Thermolactyl Chlorofibre - and this year
it has combined it with Modal to give an even lighter, softer texture.
Through its mail order brochure (ring 0274-568234 for a copy) you can still
buy the straightforward thickish long johns (Pounds 17.99) and long-sleeved
vests (Pounds 19.99). However, for some time Damart has offered much less
utilitarian options and this year it has recruited the designer Juliet Dunn.
The result is a well-priced collection which should have something for
almost everybody - vests for children, lace-edged long-sleeved vests (Pounds
16.99), short-sleeved vests with delicate lace trim at the neck and trimming
on the sleeves (Pounds 12.99), while its camibrief (Pounds 12.99 and like a
very lacey body, only warmer) would look glamorous under a tuxedo.
Marks and Spencer's Warmwear line, introduced last year, is particularly
versatile (I wear it as nightwear on safaris) and although M&amp;S has more or
less run out of this winter's supply, there is still some to be bought if
you look around.
C &amp; A produced some excellent thermal wear this winter, combining
practicality with glamour and all at great prices. It still has quite a good
selection in most of its stores. It, too, has homed in on glamour with lots
of lace trim and scalloped edging and soft fabrics so that tops in
particular can do double-duty as outerwear.
Top of the range names to look out for are Hanro, a Swiss make, which
besides the usual cotton and fine wool has a particularly 'thermal' range
made from a combination of fine wool and silk. To team with the skinny vests
(round-necked, V-necked, short-sleeved, long-sleeved) it has equally skinny
and delicately lace-trimmed pants (briefs, long-leg and very long-legs).
Stocked by Fenwick of New Bond Street, Harvey Nichols and Harrods, both of
Knightsbridge, London SW1 and other good department stores, prices are
higher with a pair of briefs selling for about Pounds 15 and a set of wool
and silk long johns and long-sleeved vest costing about Pounds 120.
John Smedley fine-guage woollen and sea-island cotton underwear has become a
cult name. Beautifully made, the woollen range is clearly the one for chilly
mortals to seek for the combination of simplicity and fine quality. Prices
start at about Pounds 30 and it is sold by S. Fisher of Burlington Arcade,
Way In at Harrods and by many good stores (phone 0629-534-571 for
stockists).

FT  15 JAN 94 / Fashion: The infiltration of the designer suit -
Professional men are, at last, seeking more adventurous clothing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Although the designer suit has been worn by the more trendy professionals
for years, there are still some spheres - primarily the law, finance and
insurance - in which it remains largely uncharted sartorial territory. Many
men working in these areas still tend to stick to the tried and tested
uniforms of English classic style and remain suspicious of anything that
smacks of the new or avant-garde.
However, increasing numbers are adopting a more fashionable wardrobe: the
capital markets are awash with men in Armani suits, and adventurous ties
have long replaced more sombre neckwear.
While men have moved closer to fashion, the fashionable designers have
embraced the leitmotifs of classical tailoring. Katharine Hamnett has
produced a 'a softened-up Savile Row look'.
She says: 'It's all about knowing the rules and breaking them. There is
nothing sexier than a man in a Savile Row suit.'
Milanese designer Romeo Gigli who has just opened an impressive shop in
London's South Molton Street, has taken old-fashioned menswear cloths and
cut them in his thoroughly modern A-line shape. Likewise Rei Kawakubo, with
her simple blue gabardine suit, has stripped the traditional jacket of all
clutter associated with tailoring and reinterpreted it in a simple and
understated way.
But what exactly is different about a designer suit? It is generally cut in
a contemporary way that takes the classic ingredients and reinterprets them,
using them sometimes in surprising ways. A designer such as Gigli, for
instance, juxtaposes a casual patch pocket on to a dark suit, Hamnett cuts
her trousers in an altogether more body-conscious way than would be possible
in Savile Row and Rei Kawakubo abandons the heavy construction and padding
of old-fashioned tailoring in favour of a suit that suggests the natural
line of the body rather than imposing a shape on it.
Traditional tailors tend to work within well-established confines to produce
a suit of timeless appeal for the conformist; a designer produces a
fashionable garment aimed at more independently-minded individuals. It can
be made from subtly different fabrics that often make use of innovative
synthetics. It is built with a lighter, relaxed and more comfortable
construction. The designer suit is essentially a garment of now and its
appearance and feel mirrors society's move towards greater informality in
everyday life.
It is therefore a mistake to assume that it is inappropriate to office life.
The designer suit's components: a jacket, trousers and sometimes a
waistcoat, are traditional and its differences tend to be subtle. To find
out just how adventurous men are, we dressed three traditionally-minded
fellows in designer outfits. Two of them were so unused to sporting
ready-to-wear clothes that they did not even know their measurements. They
told us exactly what they thought of the designer suit.
John Morgan is associate editor of GQ magazine.

ALASDAIR DUNDAS - INVESTMENT BANKER
'Apart from not having vents, the line of the jacket is exactly the same as
I would order from my tailor,' says Dundas, who feels he could easily carry
off his double-breasted Katharine Hamnett suit at an important meeting.
He is slightly less impressed with the quality of cloth and thinks the
slender trousers might have difficulty accommodating a big city lunch. He
likes the shirt, which comes with a detachable soft collar.
'Its fun, different, but it is the sort of thing I might be more comfortable
wearing in the evening, although its big soft collar does work well with a
city suit and probably would not turn heads. The City is much more
adventurous these days.'
NEIL CRICHTON-MILLER - MANAGEMENT CONSULTANT
Crichton-Miller, husband of How To Spend It editor Lucia van der Post, was
pleased with his transformation into a Comme des Garcons man.
'This suit is wonderful. I have never put on a jacket that feels so
luscious. It is really very special and totally comfortable.'
In spite of its modernity, he found the navy, wool, two-piece suit perfectly
wearable. 'It's a very suitable colour and the tailoring is very smart, and
much more suitable for a City environment than I could have imagined - I was
expecting something much more outrageous.'
He loved the subtle colours and he was tempted to buy the suit - but the
price put him off.
TERRENCE BRAMBLE - MANAGEMENT CONSULTANT
Bramble is partner in a venture capital firm and a former Queen's Dragoon
Guard. He was less enamoured of his Romeo Gigli metamorphosis. 'Although the
cloth is quite the sort of thing I would choose and the whole suit is very
comfortable to wear, I am not keen on the cut of the jacket: I don't like
its short, boxy shape or the patchpockets,' he says.
However, Bramble is amused by the large, single button on the cuff: 'There
are more buttons on my usual cuff than on this entire jacket.'
He added: 'The modern shape is fine for media types, but I just don't think
I would be taken seriously wearing it in my walk of life.'

FT  15 JAN 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Taking the year's pulse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At this time of the year it is pointless asking restaurateurs for their
predictions.
Like jockeys and their mounts at the end of the National Hunt season they
are exhausted. Over Christmas and new year they have packed the equivalent
of six weeks trading into three, put tables and chairs into corners normally
reserved for coatstands and served too many drinks to those who should have
known better. Only the fresh air on the way to the bank has kept them going.
To discover what sort of year 1994 would be for the restaurant industry, I
turned to Champagne Charlie and Potato Pete, merchants who supply
restaurants with their daily needs. These two characters, I have come to
appreciate, have their finger on the pulse of the restaurant world.
I took the necessary precautions, in dealing with Charlie and Pete, of
avoiding straight questions. Both are entirely honest and trustworthy but
they are salesmen. Such an approach would have produced a straight but
premeditated response - the last thing I wanted.
My first encounter was with Champagne Charlie, a London wine merchant who
has carved a lucrative niche supplying the restaurant trade. He is a born
optimist, a man for whom the wine glass is never half empty but rather
always half full.
At around 2.30pm he can be spotted around London's restaurants sitting down
to a late lunch with the chef, the restaurant manager and the restaurant's
wine buyer. Under the table will be a black, square briefcase which contains
wines which, he believes, are indispensable for any good list.
'Bloody difficult for the next two years,' was his verdict on the restaurant
trade. He said it with a smile, conscious of the pleasure he derives from
his job, aware that for as long as restaurant-goers' wallets are being
squeezed, his job has had to change. He is no longer sniffing, sampling and
selling champagne - as he did so pleasurably during the 1980s - but spending
more time searching for good value bottles which can be sold in a restaurant
for Pounds 12 to Pounds 15. Of course, he will also be doing the job he
dislikes most: monitoring his customers' accounts and making sure they pay
on time.
Potato Pete, naturally, shares the same concern about money but he has never
known anything different. He started in the 1970s by buying in the old
Covent Garden fruit and vegetable market and selling directly to restaurants
from the back of a van. His business grew and, in the mid-1980s, he cleverly
merged with a big wholesaler. Now he buys Pounds 20m worth of produce a year
and watches others load the vans. But his working day is no more enviable.
Up at 1am, at work until midday and then home for a short sleep, some time
with the family and the opportunity to sample London's newest restaurants.
Whatever the future may hold for Potato Pete, he believes that it is never
going to be as good commercially as it was in the mid-1980s. Part of the
problem is psychological. Everybody in the restaurant trade is so looking
forward to the pre-Christmas boost that when it comes it never lives up to
expectations.
And there is one very specific reason why the mid-1980s' boom is unlikely to
return. While all the restaurants in London may be fully booked for the last
three weeks of December, real turnover, for the likes of Pete, lies in the
hotel dining rooms which host corporate dinners, office Christmas parties
and new year festivities. But company treasurers have been closely
scrutinising corporate entertainment.
Charlie and Pete do agree on one point that unites them with everyone else
fortunate enough to have held their job: that whatever the financial
outcome, they have never had to work so hard. This is not something which
will surprise restaurateurs. With unsocial, long hours and an average net
return of no more than 10 per cent, this has never been a business for the
idle.
However, the situation is unlikely to ease. Those restaurateurs adept enough
to survive and prosper over the past three years will still struggle to
answer the bookings line quickly enough. Their competitors, in less
favourable sites with less appetising wares, will be less fortunate.
Yet the prospects for restaurant-goers are good. Competition, a low
inflation rate and increased demand will stop prices rising. And, as
restaurateurs realise the importance of marketing, we should all benefit.
Seth Lewis, a New Yorker trying to instil New York know-how into his job as
food and beverage manager of the Grosvenor House, in central London, puts it
succinctly: 'Business is good. The trouble is it is only good 40 weeks a
year. We have got to make it 52.'

FT  15 JAN 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Bergerac emerges from the shadows - A new
generation is influencing one of France's less well-known districts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDMUND PENNING-ROWSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To the outside world, the Bergerac district of south-west France is known
less for its wines than for the fictional Cyrano, although production began
many centuries before he made his appearance. Most were white until about 60
years ago but now they are 70 per cent red, the balance being dry,
medium-dry and sweet whites.
The grapes are the same as in next-door Gironde. The reds are Merlot (70 per
cent overall), Cabernets Sauvignon and Franc, plus a little Malbec. The
whites are Sauvignon, Semillon and Muscadelle.
As in much of St Emilion, the soil is chalk and clay, producing fairly
full-bodied but not very tannic red wines which drink very agreeably after
four or five years. The dry whites are for early consumption, but the
sweeter varieties deserve more time than most of the reds.
Although vines dominate the landscape, particularly on the hillsides of the
Dordogne river valley, the 12,900 hectares that produce 50,000 to 60,000
hectolitres a year total only 10 per cent of Bordeaux's huge output. This is
part of Bergerac's problem for, lying in the shadow of its better-known
neighbour, prices and quality have been affected adversely in the struggle
to market its wines.
The problem remains, but things are changing thanks to a new generation of
proprietors and an influx of young oenologists. Now, nearly half the
production is sold in bottle and a fifth is exported.
Another difficulty is a surfeit of appellation controlees: there are 13 of
them and more are threatened.
If Bergerac is not a prominent name on world markets, then its locally
prized sub-districts of Montravel, near the Gironde border; Saussignac,
south of the river but further east; and Pecharmant (described by wine buffs
as 'the Medoc of Bergerac') on the hillside above the town, mean even less
to outsiders. Montravel has three ACs for its dry, medium and sweet whites
and would like a fourth for its reds, now classified as Bergerac rouge - by
far the biggest appellation.
Then there is Rosette, the six growers of which make an annual average of
only 1,100 cases of sweetish white wine near Pecharmant. In addition, there
are superior Cote ACs for the hillsides. The only well-known sub-district is
Monbazillac; its splendid chateau dominates a section of the southern
hillside and has its own vineyard.
Improvements are in train for this appellation, which covers 2,500 hectares.
Its quality and reputation fell when it adopted machine-picking in 1979, but
an official decree last year insisted on hand-picking and at least two or
three passages (triages) through the vineyard to pick only fully-ripe
grapes, plus a minimum natural alcoholic content of 14.5 degrees.
Hand-picking is three times more expensive than machine picking, however,
and output of this delicious, inexpensive sweet wine may be reduced by
growers who cannot afford it. Instead, they may pick early and sell as
Bergerac Sec.
The many separate appellations are a bar to promoting Bergerac's products
but not a criticism of the wines themselves. Montravel whites are
attractive, especially the liquorous ones, and so are the Saussignacs, which
are rather less luscious than Monbazillacs adjoining them on the hillsides.
Fermentation and ageing in oak have been increasing in the superior
properties in the sub-districts and the Cotes.
A pioneer in introducing Bergerac wines to Britain is Nicholas Ryman, of the
handsome Ch La Jaubertie. He used to own a London stationery business, but
emigrated with his family to the south bank hillsides in 1970. Today, he
believes that Bergerac's future lies in white wines, especially the sweet
ones.
A more recent English newcomer is Richard Doughty who acquired a property
near Saussignac and renamed it Ch Richard in 1988. He makes both reds and
whites.
Like many French wine districts, Bergerac is in a state of transition, some
of it negative. Partly because of recession and reduced consumption, and
partly because of new world and east European competition, vineyards are
being abandoned or replanted with other crops.
Up to 100 vignerons (1,700 now declare a crop) are said to be leaving the
Dordogne's top wine-making district each year because they can sell to the
trade only at a loss. On the other hand, modern techniques are being
employed with success, although prices are still low.
Among British merchants usually listing Bergerac wines are: Berawell &amp;
Jones, Ipswich, Suffolk; Berry Bros &amp; Rudd, London SW1; Bibendum, London
NW1; Haynes, Hanson, Hanson &amp; Clark, London SW8; Lay &amp; Wheeler, Colchester,
Essex; Oddbins; and the Wine Society, Stevenage, Herts. Prices range from
around Pounds 4.50-Pounds 6.50 a bottle, with Monbazillac and the sweeter
wines from Pounds 6-10.

Bagatelle in south London must be the most authentic patissier-traiteur in
London. It serves wonderful French-style cakes as well as the usual prepared
dishes available from similarly grand establishments in Paris and the French
provinces. This year Bagatelle has added the traditional northern French
galette des rois to its range.
The idea resembles the old twelfth cakes which existed in this country in
Swift's time (see the Journal to Stella) but which have disappeared.
They should be eaten as close as possible to the Feast of Epiphany (January
6) but they are still available.
Inside the cake there is a coronet. The person who gets it becomes 'king' of
the day. Be careful of your teeth.
The galettes start at Pounds 6.70 for four persons and go up to Pounds 29.80
for 16. Bagatelle is also offering the traditional Provencal brioche filled
with a rum and orange blossom cream. Bagatelle: 44 Harrington Road, London
SW7. Tel: 071-581-1551. Orders 081-453-1340.

FT  15 JAN 94 / Food &amp; Drink: A curious French-English cocktail - Giles
MacDonogh has some culinary ups and downs in Jersey
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILES MACDONOGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I DID not know quite what to expect from Jersey. I half imagined an island
filled with retired Jaguar salesmen with Basil Brush accents - and thought I
spotted a few propping up the bar in the Old Court House Inn in St Aubin -
but I was put right on this subject by a resident: you need around Pounds
2.5m to retire to Jersey, and business in Jags is just not that brisk.
With so much wealth about one might expect to see some of its trappings; but
no, the Jersey rich seem on the stingy side. And there is another face to
the island: the daily delivery of grockles from all over Britain; the sort
who have yet to learn about Benidorm and who eke out their holidays on the
tightest of budgets. They may be spotted in the chippies of St Helier
wearing multi-coloured shellsuits.
Then there are the natives: a curious cocktail of French and English. The
English speak with a slightly Australian-sounding twang; an accent made
famous by Alan Whicker. The French potato farmers keep themselves to
themselves - although they can be traced to the public bars on the north of
the island - speaking a clear, up-to-date French, and drinking pints of
beer.
In spite of the farmers and the French road names, France does not spring
quickly to mind on Jersey, although the coast is only 14 miles away to the
east.
This is sad. There is something oppressive about Jersey's British holiday
resort feeling: the chip shops, the shellsuits; the sites of great natural
beauty (of which there are many) where the only available refreshment is a
Walls' ice cream or a stale bun. French restaurants have a habit of failing,
like the acclaimed Granite Corner on the north side of the Island, praised
in the Good Food Guide. It has now lost its Perigourdin chef.
Doran's Courtyard Bistro, in St Helier, is a friendly place, but excessively
provincial. The cooking is in what one might call the Jeanette Winterson
style: the titles of the dishes had all mated with the contents of the fruit
bowl. The decent Jersey Pottery Restaurant in Gorey is a tourist trap,
luring holiday-makers in to buy lacklustre pots. Portions here are generous
in an American way. I ordered a small portion of scallops but unwisely
neglected to repeat small when it came to the lobster salad and was all but
defeated by the sheer quantity of food. A starter of melon and crab turned
out to be two melons filled with the insides of what looked like a dozen
large crustaceans.
Closer contact with France could solve a number of local problems. There is
the terrible drawback of so much produce coming from Britain. The only good
cheesemonger, Select Tastes in the market in St Helier, suffers from lack of
demand for its largely English list. With only two wine merchants to choose
from, most has to be brought from London, which results in high transport
costs.
Doug le Mesurier, who farms rock oysters at Royal Bay, knows his natural
market is France where there is an inexhaustible demand.
On mainland Britain, the law requires him to treat oysters with ultra-violet
rays, a costly process which is rendered otiose by the cleanliness of
Jersey's coastal waters.
And his oysters are good: some of the sweetest I have tasted; refreshed, he
says, by freshwater wells which spout far out to sea. There are other things
to be had besides potatoes and tomatoes: Ralph Mouger makes a clean, sappy
wine at the Chateau le Catillon; and if Randalls has stopped brewing beer
and gone over to importing from the mainland, the Ann Street Brewery's Mary
Ann pubs serve an Old Jersey real ale on hand pump.
There is even a brew pub called the Tipsy Toad making three beers: Jimmy's
Bitter, Agile Frog and, if you are in luck, Horny Toad.
To forget the downside of Jersey you must go to Longueville Manor.
Malcolm Lewis, his Norwegian wife, Hild, and his sister, Sue Dufty, are
charming hosts. The Lewises left Lancashire for Jersey three generations ago
but there are still reminders - like the slab of black pudding with the
English breakfast.
Longueville Manor is once again the best place to eat on Jersey, so if you
have money to launder in one of the island's banks, do not hesitate. The
best way to experience chef Andrew Baird's cooking is the sampler menu at
Pounds 50 (without wine): a salad of pan-fried foie gras with apples and
celeriac; courgette and its flower filled with salmon mousse; a ragout of
Jersey lobster, scallops and Dublin Bay prawns; the lightest of asparagus
consommes; and a pink champagne sorbet. This was followed by best end of
lamb complete with vegetables - I fear too large a portion for the menu;
marinated goats' cheese on baby vegetables, which I found dull, but I admit
I was flagging by then; and a super peach Melba.
I defy anyone to retain an appetite for the petits fours.
The hotel and its kitchen were clearly good enough to attract a big party of
Frenchmen who were unloading their bags just as I was leaving. Some days
before there had been a commotion on the island when some French fishermen
had occupied the Ecrehous reefs belonging to Jersey. As I travelled home it
struck me that the Frenchmen at the hotel might have been the advanced guard
in some future invasion of Jersey. I do hope so.

FT  15 JAN 94 / The Nature of Things: Maths-based trading brings eldorado
closer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Making money out of financial markets purely by applying mathematical
principles, without having to know anything about the shares or currencies
or commodities being traded, is a long-standing dream.
Chartists - or technical analysts, as they prefer to be called - have
believed for decades that they are half way to eldorado, identifying buying
and selling signals on price charts. But the evidence backing their claims
has been equivocal at best.
Now, however, new-style mathematical operators are emerging. They use
powerful computers, programmed with innovative models of the way markets
work, to pick out subtle signs that would be invisible to the eye of the
traditional chartist. And the latest evidence suggests that some have struck
gold.
It is hard to gauge the extent of maths-based computer trading, or its
record so far, because almost all the active practitioners are highly
secretive. They think that as word gets out about their successes and more
people join in, it will become harder to maintain an advantage. So the
pioneers are reluctant to talk about what they are doing, let alone divulge
any details of technique.
But observers believe that more than a dozen companies, ranging from large
banks to specialised investment boutiques, have started such funds within
the last year. Their returns (net of transaction costs) are said to be at
least 10 per cent a year better than the overall markets in which they
operate.
So what is the secret? Unfortunately, there isn't one - or rather, nothing
within the reach of ordinary private investors. There is no simple formula
to learn, no predictive program you can feed into a personal computer to
flash reliable 'buy' and 'sell' signals.
Profitable trading requires an immensely complicated combination of
formulae, extracted from relatively new mathematical fields such as
non-linear statistics, chaos theory and neural networking. To make good use
of them, you need an immense database - filling billions of bytes of
computer memory and ideally covering every trade or price movement in your
chosen market for the past few years.
Before you begin live trading, your computer has to analyse the database
extensively, finding consistent patterns on which it can base predictions of
future movements. And of course you must have on-line access to the market,
so that you can execute a deal the moment the computer tells you conditions
are right.
Given the present state of computer technology and knowledge about market
behaviour, you probably need at least Dollars 100m to sustain a maths-based
trading fund.
Computer-based prediction does not rely on inefficiencies in the market -
getting hold of price-sensitive information before everyone else has. Indeed
it works best in a perfect market undistorted by inefficiency.
Ultimately it makes use of the fact that market traders act in ways that are
inconsistent but, to some extent, predictable. In technical terms, their
behaviour is non-linear; their reactions are not in proportion to events.
A very simple example of non-linearity is to ask yourself whether you would
prefer to receive a guaranteed Pounds 8,000 or an 80 per cent chance of
winning Pounds 10,000. Then ask whether you would rather lose a certain
Pounds 8,000 or take an 80 per cent risk of losing Pounds 10,000. The common
answer is to take the cheque in hand in the first case and run the risk in
the second. In other words, people are more ready to take a chance with a
loss than with a profit, even when the odds are identical.
Although some non-linear systems are too complex to predict even with the
most powerful computers, financial markets come just within the bounds of
useful predictability. And they seem to be rather more predictable at times
of increased volatility, when markets are rocked by external events. The
point is not to forecast the events themselves but their knock-on effects.
The techniques offer a feast of jargon. The autoregressive conditional
heteroskedastic model, for example, shows how periods of market volatility
are clustered. Time-delayed embedding reveals that market trends last for
longer in periods of low volatility.
Maths-based computer trading is likely to spread rapidly as word gets around
about its success. Once the technique has proved itself, financial
institutions will enable small investors to join in, by launching
mathematical mutual funds or unit trusts.
The veins of predictability will become harder to exploit, as more people
try to mine them. Ever more sophisticated programs will be required, running
on ever more powerful computers. But now that a mathematical eldorado has
been discovered, it is unlikely to disappear completely.

FT  15 JAN 94 / Poles apart at the border: Matthew Kaminski's rail journey
to Vilnius is ended abruptly by frontier guards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MATTHEW KAMINSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The clouds are starting to pass over fries and a Coke at MacBurger. It is
around 9.40am in Bialystok, a north-eastern Polish city.
Just hours ago I was asleep on the overnight from Warsaw to Vilnius. At
3.10am, there was a knock on the compartment door. I knew the routine. The
train passes without stopping through a 10km stretch of Belarus, before
heading into Lithuania.
For some reason the Belarussians, who never before had their own state and
still betray little national fealty, are the most vigilant at the frontier.
A stone-faced, moustachioed guard curtly demanded passports. I handed him
mine, dazed. He flipped through it several times and asked for a Belarussian
transit visa. I told him I did not need one because I was a Polish citizen
headed to Vilnius. Silent, he walked away with my documents.
A Polish passport, issued in Washington years after my parents pulled me out
of the third grade and emigrated west, has come in handy in the old Soviet
empire, letting me pass through new and cumbersome borders without visas or
bribes. Until now, there were no problems.
Thirty minutes later he came back. He told me to follow him. We quickly
walked down at least five dark train corridors, he always several steps
ahead, to a compartment with seven border guards. They wore green uniforms,
long overcoats and hats with large red stars. All Belarussian boys from
Grodno, the border town: haughty, provincial, important.
The captain, slouching in the corner, took the passport. Immediately, he
demanded Dollars 30 (Pounds 20.20), about half the average monthly wage in
Belarus. Or DM50. A boy sitting next to him confidently added British pounds
would be fine, too.
I again insisted I did not need any visa, no less a transit visa for a 15
minute stay. I flashed my Lithuanian press pass to prove my eastern roots.
Nothing.
They got mad. No English word - rude, insolent, hostile - can aptly describe
certain behaviour encountered in the east. After a few verbal exchanges, one
boy, hair rumpled, stuck the passport in my face, pointing to my official
place of residence with obvious hatred: Washington DC, US.
I tried to take the passport but he furiously slapped my hand and threatened
to hit me. The others laughed. The young captain said, calmly, that I would
simply be sent back.
The first fight was over. I told him I could pay handsomely in Polish zlotys
or Lithuanian litas; I only had Dollars 3. Swindling is a normal transaction
cost here; principles should be left at home. But the captain laughed again.
'Funny money,' he said, contemptuously blowing air through his fingers.
I lost. Often I had seen easterners bargain with that special (post) Soviet
type: people in uniform, from greedy police officers to impertinent store
clerks. Pleading, crying and bribing. Unfortunately I have not yet learned
how to do that well. So I started yelling, a skill finely honed in the east,
rolling off all the Russian curse words I knew.
They took me off the train. The offer for hard currency - tvarda valuta -
was made again at a Grodno police station, now with 20 Belarussians eyeing
me over.
An older man, with three silver stars on his epaulet, eventually brought me
back to the rail station and shoved me on a west-bound train. I asked,
several times in broken Russian, kak vash zavut? He only smirked and pushed
me ahead. Once on the train - an express from Minsk to Bialystok - he said
his name proudly, 'Ruslan Marchenko', and twice declared, I'm not sure why,
'This is the independent Republic of Belarus'.
The wait back at the border took almost three hours. Polish customs officers
now had their turn. Next door, three Georgians had at least seven bags. The
Poles went through them all and confiscated, after much fuss, 65 bottles of
honey-coloured alcohol intended for farmers' markets - so called targs or
jarmarks - around Bialystok. The guards even made the Georgians carry the
heavy goods off the train.
At daybreak I was thrown off the second train, right at the border in a
place called Kuznica Bialystocka. The morning drunks, Belarussians and
Poles, were gathering at a rag tag station. Again half asleep, I bought a
ticket on a regional train to Sokolka, a small city, via Czuprynowo-Kundzin,
an even smaller one.
Sokolka is a typical small eastern town - a mix of old peasant wooden homes,
with chickens scraping in dirt-patch backyards, and concrete apartment
blocks. Not exactly out of Kosinki's Painted Bird but not exactly modern,
either. From there, an hour later, an overflowing bus brought me to
Bialystok, the regional capital.
At the grimy bus station, there was the Georgian family again, huddling
around their bags, the woman crying. Poles, Belarussians, Romanians and
gipsies were milling around as well. Russian is heard more often than
Polish.
MacBurger's white walls and tidy red tables are right across the street. A
young cashier, in pressed white T-shirt, asked if I'd like something else.
Still hungry, I'm now waiting for a pineapple burger.

FT  15 JAN 94 / Minding Your Own Business: My own little shop of horrors -
Jane Whitehead dreamt of running her own business: it was a nightmare
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE WHITEHEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I dreamt about owning my own business for years. Every December 31 it would
be top of my resolutions list. But like losing weight and becoming a better
person, nothing ever came of it. Then suddenly I was 35. Mid life crisis. If
I did not do it now, I never would.
I knew exactly what it would be like, I had pictured it so often. On one
side the pretty, cosy, bustling tea shop, on the other, exquisite crafts at
affordable prices. Somewhere in there, me, swanning around, the amiable
hostess.
The decision was made. I counted my life savings - Pounds 6,000; amazingly I
persuaded three friends to chip in another Pounds 18,000; went to see a very
generous man at Barclays Bank who opened a sack of money and told me to help
myself. I relieved him of Pounds 25,000; took small business advice from all
sides; thanked my employers for 18 fairly mediocre years and set off in
search of my dream.
Somewhere along the way during the discussions, planning and more
discussions, the tea shop idea was ditched in favour of an upmarket
children's boutique.
Armed with the knowledge that the three most important requirements for a
retail outlet are - location, location and location, I searched for two
months. There was nothing. This was early 1989. Boom time. The punters were
spending. Shopkeepers had never been so happy. Not a 'To Let' sign in sight.
And so it was, after a month of protracted negotiations I handed over an
Pounds 8,000 premium for the three-year lease on a grubby, insect infected,
disused sweet shop just off the main parade in a monied area of Cheshire.
Rent: Pounds 100 per week.
No expensive, bland shopfitters for me, three months of hard graft, assisted
by willing volunteers, transformed the hovel into a whitewashed, pine-clad,
coir-matted oasis. With Pounds 15,000 of stock tastefully displayed, I was
ready. The delay, costs and knocks along the way had not dented my
enthusiasm. I was raring to go.
I took Pounds 750 that first week. No, not a fortune, but above my
expectations. This was my 'break even' figure. I had assumed it would take
an age to work up to that amount.
I had cracked it. It was going to be a success. My three financial backers
and I anticipated the profits to come. Barclays wrote pleasant encouraging
letters. Life was rosy.
It did not last. Initial enthusiasm for a new shop died down. Takings
averaged Pounds 500 a week. Nigel Lawson raised interest rates and the first
acorns of the recession began to take root.
I was in the fashion business. Stocks had to be ordered six months in
advance - a lottery. Who could say what trading conditions were going to be
so far in the future? I certainly could not. Even children do not want last
year's styles. Whatever had not been sold each season had to be got rid of
whatever the price.
Outgoings and overheads were horrific. It was one long round of paying out.
The begging from local schools and charities for donations and raffle prizes
was one large expense I had not budgeted for. How could I turn them down?
They were a source of potential customers.
The original investment of Pounds 49,000 had gone. I needed more to survive.
I did not have any. I was not earning anything. It was up to my three
friends. They came up with the goods.
I tried everything to bring the punters in. I advertised, put 'money off'
vouchers in the local press, organised charity fashion shows, distributed
expensive glossy leaflets, participated in local events, injected humour
into my window displays and installed Father Christmas and a photographer
for a week. I could not have asked for more from family and friends. But it
was all going wrong.
I began to hate it. The constant worry. I could not switch off; the
sleepless nights, the boredom, condescending mothers and badly behaved
brats. I missed the inane chatter of the office, the companionship, the
salary at the end of the month.
Barclays began to get frosty. Letters were no longer addressed Dear Jane. I
had been trading 22 months when that man who had so easily handed over
Pounds 25,000 demanded it back. Why? It was fully guaranteed, backed by the
business assets and a wad of share certificates handed over by my three
partners in crime. But it had suddenly become a different climate and the
banks were getting itchy. It happened to a lot of people.
That was the beginning of the end. Two years to the day after I opened my
lovely shop, I closed it. I had tried, without success, to sell. No one in
their right mind was taking on a retail business. Or if they wanted to there
were so many to choose from. Everywhere you looked there were the same
signs: 'business for sale', 'to let', 'closing down'.
Perversely, those signs made me feel a little better. They meant it was not
just I who had failed. But I had awakened from my dream.
Do I feel guilty about the money my friends lost? Yes. Very much. Thankfully
they are still friends.
Do I regret doing it? No. If I had not I would still be dreaming about it.
At least now it is behind me. It was an experience and I learnt a lot of
lessons. Now I can move on to my new dream.

FT  15 JAN 94 / Minding Your Own Business: Hard edge of the good life -
Clive Fewins meets a couple who eke out a living from the soil selling
vegetable boxes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE FEWINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Tim and Jan Deane arrived at their 24-acre smallholding on the edge of
the Dartmoor National Park in 1984 they had to chainsaw their way in.
'The remains of the gate was buried under trees and other vegetation, and
the rest of the plot was in very poor condition,' said Tim, who had always
wanted to farm but had thought he would never be able to raise the money to
buy the land.
Nine years later, eight acres on the hillside venture are producing nearly
50 kinds of organic vegetable.
But while the Deanes' crops - or most of them - are flourishing, profits are
not. 'I fail to see how any small organic grower in our situation and with
our soil conditions can earn a really good living,' said Tim. 'Last year we
paid ourselves Pounds 3,100 each out of our profit of just over Pounds
6,000. In all our years here we have yet to reach the income tax threshold.'
On their meagre profits the Deanes have to support two children aged 15 and
12. They manage without complaining, and are convinced the future will bring
better times. Besides, they all enjoy their way of life at Northwood Farm,
which lies in an idyllic spot on the slopes of the Teign valley, 10 miles
from Exeter.
'Hardship is the price of continuing with our youthful idealism and doing
things the way we want to, with as little compromise as possible,' said Jan,
who, like her husband, is 43.
'Of course we would like a little more money. It would be nice to have a
house, as we have lived in two, and now three, caravans for the past nine
years. But we realised when we bought the land - it cost Pounds 28,000 -
that we would never be rich. We call our way of life homesteading.'
The organic farming co-operative the Deanes belonged to collapsed two years
ago, leaving them Pounds 1,000 worse off - a lot of money to them. Since
then they have concentrated on selling vegetable boxes, rather than
wholesaling.
'This season is the first in which all our production has gone into
vegetable boxes. And thanks to the weather it was a near disaster,' said
Tim.
Nevertheless, the Deanes have many satisfied customers in the surrounding
villages and in Exeter. There is a waiting list for the service.
This is how the vegetable box system works: each week the Deanes pack a
week's supply of vegetables into boxes which they deliver directly to houses
in the villages and to drop-off points in Exeter where boxholders help to
distribute in return for a concessionary box.
The customers have little choice. If they are regulars - as most are - and
do not like a particular vegetable, they tell Tim and Jan; otherwise it is
the Deanes who decide.
'Basically we pack what is best, freshest and in season,' said Jan. 'Most of
the produce is picked, packed and delivered within 24 hours.' Nothing is
weighed, and the charge is Pounds 4, Pounds 5 or Pounds 6 depending on box
size.
Every week the Deanes plan the contents of the boxes so that there will be
enough staples, but also variety to stimulate a good cook. They aim at a
minimum of eight vegetables and herbs, even in winter. They also try to
include one or two vegetables, such as kohlrabi and celeriac, not widely
available in the shops.
'Our customers say the produce is good - some even pay more than the asking
price - fresh, and reasonably priced,' said Jan.
All the Northwood Farm produce is organic. The Deanes believe in feeding the
soil, not the plants. They feed the soil with food, such as muck, compost,
and some rock phosphate and calcified seaweed.
This season Jan has been supplementing their income by working as a Soil
Association inspector in Devon three or four days a month. She also
organises occasional courses for the Soil Association. These activities keep
the family car on the road, while the business supports Tim's elderly
ex-Post Office parcels van.
Thanks to the vegetable boxes, profit on turnover has risen from 33 per cent
to more than 50 per cent. Nevertheless it is meagre. Turnover has never
exceeded Pounds 20,000.
'It should have been better this year, but the weather put paid to that,'
Tim said. 'All the way through it was wrong for our soil type. The potatoes
had no real root, so we produced two tonnes per acre, when eight to 10
tonnes would be a good organic yield. The cabbages, leeks and brassicas were
all poor because the heavy rain in May and early June washed the nutrients
out of the roots.'
The result was that the Deanes were short of produce. They had orders for
180 boxes, but could only supply 140 households. 'Forty boxes is the
difference between profit and loss,' Tim said.
'I fear our overdraft will be far higher than we'd prefer by February. This
is the time of year when we are usually better off, as it is the end of our
seven month delivery season. I just hope we have enough cash to launch
ourselves into the growing season.'
Fortunately, Tim has an understanding brother who several years ago took the
burden of the small mortgage. They pay him interest - but far less than they
would pay a bank or building society.
Tim admits that were it not for the generosity of Jan's father - he paid
Pounds 20,000 of the original cost of the property and has helped them out
when times have been bad - they would have had even more of a struggle to
survive.
'He has great faith in us,' Tim said. 'So does Jan's mother - her
great-grandfather, a Canadian, was homesteading well into his 90s.
'Over the years our bank manager has also been kind to us. He is a farmer's
son, and very pro organic farming. But now the account has been taken over
by another branch and our new manager has decided to pay us a visit - the
first here by any bank manager. Somehow when he sees Shacksville I think
he'll get a surprise.'

FT  15 JAN 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Income tax query
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I wonder if you would be good enough to set out for me, step by step, the
income tax calculation for 1993/94 assuming one has a salary of Pounds
20,000, investment (equities gross) of Pounds 10,000, a gross income of
Pounds 30,000, and one is under 65 and married.
It is the treatment of the married couples allowance at 20 per cent which
has perplexed me. I might add that I phoned the Revenue Enquiry Room for an
explanation but they 'regretted that they had no instructions yet'.
The restriction of relief on the married couple's allowance to 20 per cent
does not come into effect until 1994-95; it will be restricted to 15 per
cent for 1995-96.
Your 1994-95 tax liability on the suggested figures would be as follows:
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Schedule E
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                    Pounds

Pounds 20,000                                     3,988.75
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Pounds 10,000                                     6,559.75
Less: relief on Pounds 1,720
at 20 per cent                                      344.00
Income tax chargeable                             6,225.75

FT  15 JAN 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Wife can sell shares
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I have obtained from the Inland Revenue leaflet number CGT 15, A Guide For
Married Couples in respect of Capital Gains Tax.
It is my understanding from reading this document that if I transfer a
shareholding, currently in my name, to my wife, the shares may then be sold
in my wife's name in order legitimately to make use of her CGT allowance.
Furthermore if the sale is then split, part of it before April 5, 1994, and
the rest after, it would appear that total gains of approximately Pounds
10,000 could be free of CGT.
Given that my own allowance has been fully utilised, this seems to be a
sensible option to take. Is this correct in your opinion?
Your choice of words (such as 'sold in my wife's name' rather than simply
'sold by my wife') suggests that you are not contemplating making a bona
fide outright gift of shares to your wife, but merely using her as a nominee
or puppet to realise funds which will find their way back to you, albeit
indirectly.
However, if you propose to give your wife some measure of financial
independence by making outright gifts of shares to her, then the answer is
yes: if she decides to sell some of the gifted shares on or before April 5
and others after, she will have two annual exempt amounts of Pounds 5,800 to
set against her chargeable gains.
We recommend that the proceeds, and any dividends arising after the gifts,
be credited to an account in your wife's sole name (to which you have no
access), so that it is clear that none of the money can be construed as for
your ultimate benefit.

FT  15 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: In search of tax-efficiency -
Expatriates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DONALD ELKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Are life policies a suitable investment for expatriates or are the benefits
of their tax-efficiency exaggerated?
'Qualifying' maximum investment plans which have a minimum 10-year term and
which provide minimal life cover - 75 per cent of the prospective premiums
payable - are a common investment for expatriates.
They are often chosen because of the perceived tax benefits after return to
the UK since no personal tax is payable on the proceeds, whether received as
a single payment or a series of payments over a number of years.
Unfortunately, perhaps fewer than one in 10 of the expatriates who invest in
this way will achieve any significant tax benefits.
Broadly, UK life companies pay tax on the income and gains of their life
funds at 25 per cent, which is the same as the basic rate of tax paid by
individuals. Investing in an offshore policy will not indefinitely avoid the
payment of this tax because you must convert to an equivalent UK policy
within one year of becoming a UK resident to maintain its qualifying status.
Consequently, you will achieve no benefit at all if your marginal rate of UK
tax is the basic rate when you receive your 'tax free' payments. Of course,
if you are a higher rate payer, the situation is different, for you will
have paid just 25 per cent via the life company against the 40 per cent that
you would have paid as an individual.
However, few returning expatriates these days pay higher rate tax. Bear in
mind that if spouses can divide income equally between them, they would
jointly need more than Pounds 56,000 a year (that is, more than Pounds 1m
invested at an average rate of 5 per cent) to fall into the higher rate
band.
Unfortunately the situation is not neutral. You will probably have incurred
a cost to achieve these, perhaps, illusory tax benefits. Investment
performance may be inhibited by the limitation of your investment choice.
Even if this consists of a 'menu' of 100 or more funds, that will mean that
there are perhaps 25 times as many which are not available to you.
Furthermore, you may be locked into the arrangement, since early termination
is likely to produce a bad financial deal and you might suffer surrender
penalties into the bargain.
The majority of expatriates would be better off investing through
non-contractual savings schemes, for example, a unit or investment trust,
which allow them to increase, reduce, stop and restart contributions at
will.
However, the qualifying policy is not the only, or even the most important,
life product offered to expatriates. Many are offered offshore single
premium bonds which are designed to receive lump sums.
The single premium bond appears in many guises, sometimes as a funding plan
for Maximum Investment Plans, sometimes as a managed investment and
sometimes as a pension plan. In all cases, the basic arrangement is the
same.
Once you have resumed UK residence, tax liability arises under the
'chargeable events' legislation. This allows you to withdraw 5 per cent per
annum of the sum originally invested (the premium allowance) without
provoking an immediate tax liability.
A possible exception to this is the type of bond into which you can transfer
any investments rather than, as is usually the case, being restricted to a
set menu of funds. There is a pending High Court Appeal which will determine
whether or not the premium allowance is available in this case.
You will, however, provoke an immediate tax liability if you exceed the
premium allowance and also if the bond is encashed. In the latter case, the
previous 5 per cent draw-downs have to be taken into account to calculate
the profit, which is chargeable at your marginal rate of income tax, subject
to certain reliefs.
The fact that single premium bond holders need pay no tax provided their
draw-downs do not exceed 5 per cent a year, allows for long-term tax
deferment. It is to your advantage if you can reinvest 100 per cent rather
than just 60 per cent of your surplus income, even if you have to pay tax on
all of it eventually.
Unfortunately, calculations to quantify this benefit frequently fail to take
account of the investor wishing to withdraw funds before they die. Should
they do so, they are likely to trigger the pent-up tax charge and - in the
early years of the bond - perhaps termination penalties.
Since it is necessary to remunerate the insurance company, the underlying
unit trust (perhaps) and the intermediary too, there is a tendency for the
costs of life products to be both greater and more opaque than for other
investments. Perhaps such a structure can generate meaningful advantages for
you but that is not necessarily so.
The structure of a life policy does not in itself present an inherent
investment advantage although its tax advantages were often incontestable
when top rates of income tax in the UK reached 97 per cent. Even a mediocre
performance from a life policy could leave you better off net of tax than a
well performing direct investment.
However, now that such rates are a memory, life products are probably
over-sold, particularly since today's financially sophisticated expatriates
have access to a much greater range of investment choices than before.

FT  15 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: Look at the meat, not the spice -
Perks for company shareholders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As variety is to life, shareholder benefits are the spice of an equity
investment. They are offered as a reward for loyalty or as a goodwill
gesture but should never be a reason for an investor to choose one company
over another. Spice cannot replace the meat of a company's investment
performance.
Kevin Adams, at stockbroker Seymour Pierce Butterfield, which has compiled
an annual directory of shareholder perks, for the past 15 years, said: 'An
investment should not be selected on the grounds of the concessionary
discount. Far more important is to look at the fundamentals of a company and
see if its investment strategy is one with which you agree.'
Nevertheless, 120,000 investors in P &amp; O, the ferry company, have bought the
company's stock because of car-based cross-Channel discounts of up to 50 per
cent. The minimum holding is of 600 5.5 per cent redeemable non-cumulative
preference shares, worth about Pounds 940. 'People purchase this class of
stock for the benefit,' said Michael Owen, assistant company secretary at P
&amp; O. 'The majority have had them for very many years and it is a capped
market because we cannot issue any more.'
Peter Hargreaves, chairman of Hargreaves Lansdown, the asset management
group, which also publishes a directory of perks, believes that these
benefits can sometimes contribute to a company's performance.
'Over the years many people have purchased P &amp; O concessionary shares, not
only to benefit from an attractive income, but also to benefit from the
extremely advantageous channel crossing fares. Due to the high number of
private shareholders on the P &amp; O share register, the share price has always
remained attractive and stable.'
P &amp; O's rival, Eurotunnel, which this week announced fares of between Pounds
125 to Pounds 310, will also reward its early shareholders with
concessionary travel. Someone who bought 100 shares in the Eurotunnel
flotation in 1987 is entitled to one return journey at a cost of Pounds 1
and an annual registration fee of about Pounds 10, if they make the trip
within a year of the tunnel opening. Larger shareholders are entitled to
more concessionary trips.
The number of companies offering perks has been steadily increasing
according to Adams. Seymour Pierce Butterfield's directory this year
contains 116 entries, up from 111 last year and 99 in 1992. Few companies
decide to withdraw them, said Adams, although some disappear when there is
corporate activity, such as a company takeover.
Benefits are usually in the form of a card or vouchers sent out to
shareholders once their name appears on the register, entitling them to
discounts. Others give their shareholders complimentary gifts, usually a
sample of the company's wares. Discounts often apply to the full retail
price and not to special offers.
Most companies require a minimum shareholding and other restrictions may
also apply. P &amp; O shareholders, for example, must be on the company register
by December 31 before the sailing date and must still be on the register at
the sailing date to qualify.
The value of benefits can vary enormously. Bensons Crisps gives shareholders
attending the company's annual general meeting free packets of crisps for
tasting and taking home.
By contrast, Asprey, the jeweller and silversmith, will give a discount of
15 per cent on cash and cheque purchases. The discount does not apply to
repairs or valuations and only investors with at least 5062 ordinary shares
are eligible for the Asprey card. This means a holding of just over Pounds
16,000 in Asprey shares at the current share price.
Other potentially valuable company perks include those offered by British
Airways, Trafalgar House, Airtours, Forte and The Savoy Hotel. BA posts a
coupon to those with a minimum of 200 shares giving the shareholder the
right to 10 per cent off published air fares, including Apex, and it can be
used by those travelling on Concorde. The discount applies only once in a
year.
If the investor flies between the slack travel months of January 1 and March
31 this year, the reduction doubles to 20 per cent. Other concessions are
also available.
Airtours will give all shareholders 10 per cent off its holidays while
Trafalgar House investors can get a 15 per cent reduction on selected QE2
and other cruises (minimum shareholding: 500 ordinary shares).
The Savoy Hotel group offers reductions of 10 per cent off the average room
rate at a number of its hotels, including the Savoy, Claridge's and the
Connaught. The price of an average room at the Savoy is Pounds 220 - the
discount does not apply to any special promotional offers. Investors only
need 10 ordinary shares to qualify.
Forte, the largest shareholder in the Savoy group, offers a Forte Gold Card
to investors with at least 300 Ordinary shares. The card entitles holders to
a 10 per cent discount on accommodation, meals and drinks in the company's
hotels worldwide. It can also be used at Lillywhites, the leisurewear and
sports shop in London's Piccadilly and on fine wine and hampers bought from
the Wine Growers' Association.
Most of the companies which offer shareholder benefits are in the consumer
and leisure industries but there are some in the financial sector. Bank of
Scotland shareholders applying for the bank's Premier visa card pay neither
the Pounds 10 joining fee nor the annual Pounds 70 subscription. Additional
cards, usually costing Pounds 10, are provided free. Other benefits include
a waiver of the 1 per cent commission on sterling and dollar travellers
cheques while the annual 1 per cent fee on the bank's self-select personal
equity plan is halved. You must hold at least 1,200 shares and have been on
the bank's register for one year to qualify.
Shareholders with a self-select Pep at the Royal Bank of Scotland (into
which RBS shares can be transferred) do not have to pay an initial charge.
General Accident gives all its individual shareholders premium discounts of
10 per cent on home, motor and travel insurance policies.
The 1994 Perks Book, Seymour Pierce Butterfield, 24 Chiswell Street, London
EC1Y 4TY, is published later this month. Free.
Attractive Perks for UK Shareholders, Hargreaves Lansdown, is usually Pounds
3 but is available free to FT readers who should write, quoting the offer,
to Hargreaves Lansdown Embassy House, Queens Avenue, Clifton, Bristol BS8
1SB.

FT  15 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: Assessing international risks - A
look at ways to calculate just how well emerging market and specialist funds
perform

<TEXT>
The darlings of the international investment world are emerging market and
specialist funds (technology and special opportunities). Which are the best
managed funds over the last four years? As I did with global growth funds *,
I have used two minimum performance criteria. Good fund managers must beat
the total return on the FT-A World ex-Japan, and must exceed the ratio of a
fund's risk to its return - the figure for the FT-A World ex-Japan index is
0.21.
Those funds that have passed the twin tests have been split into three
groups. These groupings reflect each fund's true investment orientation. A
further group, ethical funds, have not been included. Their histories are
too short.
The fact that we have highlighted nine of the 18 funds that qualify for our
survey tells a simple tale; this sub-sector bristles with talent. To many
this will not be a revelation since the technology and emerging market funds
have dominated the total return rankings of the International Growth sector
for the last three years.
Do not, however, be fooled into thinking that buying a technology or
emerging market fund is plain sailing. Two technology funds (Allied Dunbar
and Barclays) have poor records, and Gartmore's Frontier markets fund is a
relative dullard among emerging stars. The special opportunities subsector
is still worse with five underperformers.
Emerging market and specialists funds are a tad risky. Compared to the
average international growth fund, technology and emerging market funds are
respectively 39 per cent and 47 per cent more volatile. Most of these funds
are described as high risk although there is the odd exception. Scottish
Equitable Technology's occasionally sizeable use of cash as a safe haven,
for instance, is one reason why it has a risk rating that is only average
(its risk score is 1.1 or 10 per cent riskier than the sector average).
In contrast, special opportunities funds as a class look secure. Their
cyclical nature and lower returns mean they are only 17 per cent riskier
than the average International Growth trust.
Risk in itself is not a bad thing. It is only bad when it goes unrewarded.
By adjusting each fund's returns to take into account this risk, it is
possible to produce a risk / return score which indicates how the manager
has juggled the risks and rewards of the portfolio.
High return funds such as Framlington Health, Prosperity Emerging Markets
and City of London Emerging Markets, all of which carry the highest risk
warning (Very High), come out looking good. In each case the high risk /
return scores of these funds indicates that the high risks have been
justified by spectacularly high returns.
By contrast, the Very High risk incurred by Prolific Technology and
Henderson TR Global Technology has not been rewarded to the same degree.
Looking at this another way, a manager's success in managing a high risk /
return trade-off is valuable because it is evidence of ability.
It is also quite valuable when investing in high risk funds to be able to
pinpoint managers who are as adept at managing risk as they are with return.
The high risk / return of Perpetual's International Emerging Companies fund,
for instance, is the product of high returns relative to the benchmark but
less than interstellar risk as well. Better still, Scottish Equitable's
Technology fund has achieved its risk / return figure through a combination
of highish returns (a benchmark score of 1.37 is not to be sniffed at) and
moderate risk.
It is also important that the risk / return figure of a fund is not read in
isolation. Investors must still sift through the rest of our findings to get
a complete picture. For example, you may yearn for a technology fund and on
our rankings, the high risk / return score of Framlington Health might
suggest this fund for consideration. But look again. This fund has an
erratic total return record. The reason? It is virtually a US rather than a
global fund and is tied to the fortunes of the US market.
If you prefer a technology fund with defensive qualities, the four
year-on-year returns relative to the benchmark may be proof that Scottish
Equitable would suit. But this fund's record also shows evidence of a
trade-off between stability and total return.
Judging the records of our two emerging market funds is no simple matter
either. For in spite of the similarities between their four-year total
returns, one appears to be more defensive than the other. When, for example,
world equities took a tumble in 1990, City of London lost less than the
benchmark, whereas Prosperity slipped back a good deal further. And while
Prosperity's fortunes took off in 1991, the relative sluggishness of City of
London's pick-up suggests that both its heavier bias towards Latin America
and its individual character (it invests only in the shares of emerging
market investment trusts) make it less correlated with the rest of the world
than Prosperity's fund.
The one special opportunities fund that can hold its own against the likes
of emerging and techno stars offers a little of everything. Perpetual's
International Emerging Companies fund combines a bit of emerging markets,
technology, special situations and a lot of high quality stock selection
too. Other funds provide some interesting combinations too. GT Worldwide
Special Situations, for instance, includes a substantial technology element,
while most of the technology funds like to invest in emerging markets as
well.
Whatever your interest in International Growth trusts, to judge past
performance it is vital to take the risk / return of a fund, its causes and
its investment orientation into account. Our classifications have been
designed with these considerations in mind.

1993. The reference to GAM International in the piece should have read GAM
Sterling and International.

Key to table: Years are November-to-November. NB The four year total is
based upon monthly percentage changes so does not sum to the four
year-on-year totals. The Benchmark column shows the arithmetic
difference between the fund's return and the index's return. The BM or
benchmark ratio expresses the percentage outperformance by the fund over
the four years. Risk is total risk or volatility. Total risk is measured
by the monthly standard deviation over four years to November 30. Risk
relative to sector is each fund's standard deviation divided by the
sector's average standard deviation of 4.52. Risk/return is the division
of the four year average monthly total return by the four year standard
deviation of monthly returns. Return data is offer-to-offer, net income

FT  15 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: Playing safe with the big bonuses -
Sara Webb asks the City slickers how they are using their rewards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The recession has instilled a sense of caution among City employees, and
while bonuses for the last financial year are likely to be more generous
than in the recent past, many of the people working in the financial sector
are saving rather than splashing out.
The rally in the stock and bond markets last year meant that many City firms
made bumper profits from their trading activities and are expected to reward
their staff accordingly at bonus time.
'The feeling is that 1993 was a pretty exceptional year and people know they
are unlikely to see the same kind of profits in 1994, because it was a
one-off,' said one trader. 'Whatever it is I get eventually, I won't be
buying a round-the-world holiday, I'll be saving it.'
Some City firms will not pay their staff bonuses until the end of January or
even later in the spring when the company's accounts have been done.
At the top end of the league, Kaveh Alamouti, a trader at Tokai Bank's
London operation, attracted considerable attention when he reputedly earned
Pounds 9m in 1992 combining his salary and bonus.
Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank which was one of the first to award
its bonuses for 1993, paid 70 of its London-based executives Dollars 1m or
more. With sums that many in the City are keen to use whatever tax shelters
are available, although highly-paid individuals rue the fact that certain
tax schemes have been closed.
One arbitrage dealer said he has ploughed much of the money back into the
markets in which he specialises, although he added that he is unusual, since
'many people who work in the City are not particularly good at managing
their own financial affairs'.
'The bonus' is a sensitive subject, and not one that people like to be
quoted on, as it can draw unwanted attention to a firm. 'People tend to be a
bit reticent about how they are spending their bonus, although you find that
someone is likely to just let it slip into conversation if they have made
some money in an emerging market,' said one trader.
Anecdotal evidence from the trading floors suggests that while one or two
might be thinking of buying a yacht, many are choosing to regard this as a
one-off reward, to be saved or invested carefully.
'I know it sounds boring, but I'm just going to use the money to help pay
off my mortgage,' said one senior economist at a Japanese bank in London.
This seems to be a common approach, particularly by those in their late 20s
or early 30s who may have come into the financial sector too late to enjoy
the fruits of the 1980s bonus bonanza.
'I expect I shall use the money to redecorate my house - I've just moved,
and the previous owner had dreadful taste and painted everything battleship
grey,' said an economist at a UK bank.
Investment advisers support the view that those in the financial sector are
erring on the side of caution this year. 'They've all suffered a little,
these are the good times after the bad and there's a degree of prudence,'
said David Major, tax partner at Touche Ross.
In many cases these private clients are following the basic principles of
financial planning. That means taking advantage of the tax-efficient plans
such as Tessas, Peps and National Savings.
While the ceilings on these schemes are low, Major says considerable tax
savings can be made, especially if both husband and wife use the schemes.
John Bridel, an adviser at Towry Law, says husbands and wives can double up
their National Savings holdings by each using their respective Pounds 10,000
maximum and then writing a further Pounds 10,000 in trust for each other.
Another City favourite - the Business Expansion Scheme - which offered tax
relief as well as considerable risk in some instances, was laid to rest at
the end of last year. One trader at a US bank groaned at the mention of BES:
'God, the amount of talk there used to be on the trading floor about BES was
positively boring'.
Its successor, 'Son of BES' is the Enterprise Investment Scheme announced in
the November 30 Budget, though advisers say investors should wait to see
what kind of schemes are launched.
Equities and collective investments such as investment trusts and unit
trusts are popular with City employees. Some traders and sales staff said
they liked the idea of investing in the European privatisation investment
trusts launched by Kleinwort Benson and Mercury Asset Management recently,
while others prefer the high-growth economies in Asia.
'If the Pacific rim economies are set to grow by about 8 per cent a year,
and EC countries by 2 per cent a year, I know which area I think is the most
attractive,' said one equity salesman.
One senior manager at a US bank admitted that the subject of where to invest
had become a topic of debate among City slickers in his train carriage:
'There's a fair amount of discussion among people coming into work in the
mornings about the emerging markets - the Philippines seems to be one that
everyone talks about with interest.'
An economist at one of the UK banks said the emerging markets were popular
last year and might have been overbought, but added: 'I might put a small
amount in a Latin American fund.' However, he said that if the pound
strengthens this year, then it might be better to concentrate on
sterling-based investments, rather than take the currency risk.

FT  15 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: Hopes for annuity rate rise as
yields increase
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The table shows compulsory purchase annuity rates for individuals at a range
of ages and with Pounds 100,000 to invest. RNPFN annuities are available
only to those in the nursing and allied professions.
Peter Quinton, director of the Annuity Bureau, which supplied the table,
says: 'Worries about inflation and supply of the UK government bond market
has led to recent increases in yields but this has not yet fed through into
any rise in annuity rates. Following the upturn in 15-year gilt yields from
their trough just before Christmas, some rates could rise slightly if the
trend continues.'

FT  15 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: Timely sales made - Directors'
transactions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN ROGERS, The Inside Track
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As the revelry of the new year dies, director activity continues with a
mixture of judicious purchases and timely sales.
Vega Group, involved in the provision of computer software systems, came to
the market in June 1992 and its shares have out-performed the market by 67
per cent over the past 12 months.
Following the strong growth, directors have been selling stock: Christopher
Duckworth, the finance director, sold some back in September; more recently
he has joined with two other directors, John Rigg, the chairman, and Angus
Johnson to sell a total of 690,000 shares at 210p per share. Johnson and
Rigg both retain sizeable stakes but Duckworth's holding has been cut
considerably.
Smith New Court, the City stockbroker and market maker, saw its share price
rise 220 per cent over the past year. Given such a movement, it is not
surprising that directors are taking some of the cream off the top.
Two directors have sold a percentage of their stock: Anthony Abrahams has
more than halved his holding and Michael Heath has cut his by one third,
both at 415p.
After Osprey Communications announced its final results, Ronald Sidaway, an
executive director, bought 125,000 shares at 41p. This increases his holding
to almost 500,000 shares and reflects the note of optimism the chairman
sounded in his year-end statement.

FT  15 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: Ringing in the revolution - A look
at the way technology is affecting financial services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The British are becoming more comfortable with telephones, and this is
causing a revolution in financial services. More than 90 per cent of
households in the UK now have a phone and, although it sometimes seems
difficult to escape, it also means you are within easy reach of your banker,
insurance broker or stockbroker.
Telephone-delivered services are a hot item in mass-market financial
services, but they have been warming up for years. In the mid 1980s,
computers seemed the answer to everything. Every home was expected to
contain a computer within a few years, so linking your computer with the
bank's computer by means of a phone line seemed logical.
Bank of Scotland was the real pioneer in UK telephone banking with its
computerised Home Office Banking Service, launched in 1985. Other banks
followed with systems using home computers, specially-designed terminals, or
voice- or tone-activated systems. But almost 10 years on, there are still
many technophobes around, who do not feel comfortable plugging a computer
into their phone socket, or holding a tone-pad to the mouthpiece.
The financial services industry soon realised that although people were
happy using the phone, what they mostly wanted was human contact, not
screeching modems. So telephone and computer-based services where the
interaction is with a person have taken off - look at the success of Direct
Line in the general insurance market. It could not operate without
sophisticated information technology, but customers deal with a friendly,
human being at the end of a phone.
First Direct, the independent Midland offshoot launched in 1989, has shown
the way for personal banking with a similar formula. Many of the banks which
rushed to offer computer-based services in the late 1980s are giving up on
the high-tech approach and going for real people instead.
The TSB is phasing out its Speedlink service, to be replaced with a 24-hour
fully staffed operation. Lloyds gave up on its computerised phone service in
1990, and is now planning to join the club of telephone bankers with a human
touch later this year. Barclays has successful pilots for its new personal
service running in several regions, and is planning to go national in due
course. NatWest has both the computer-based ActionLine, and PrimeLine, a
centralised, personal-contact service for customers earning more than Pounds
18,000.
The Bank of Scotland still operates HOBS, and has many loyal customers for
it, but it has also succumbed to the human revolution, and launched Phone
Line, a real people service, as well. Earlier this month, Bristol &amp; West
became the first building society to offer a 24-hour, fully-staffed
telephone service for investors.
However, First Direct has not been the model in all ways. It is a
centralised operation, with no branches, and customers are not allocated to
a particular manager. The majority of the rival services are designed as
supplements to branches: customers have a choice of voice-to-voice or
face-to-face contact, and they can still feel that somewhere there is a
manager with personal responsibility for their account.
The attraction of telephone banking for most people is speed and
convenience. You do not have to visit the bank branch except to pay in
cheques (and that can be done by post). There is certainly no need to queue
to pay the gas bill, change a standing order or direct debit, check your
balance, order a cheque book and so on. Some banks let you order foreign
currency over the phone, haggle over your overdraft, or even arrange a
mortgage or buy and sell shares.
Girobank says its most common service over the phone is giving an up-to-date
account balance, followed by chequebook requests and checks on whether a
salary or some other payment has been paid in.
Additionally, all the telephone banking services are open for longer hours
than normal banks, including at weekends. First Direct says that more than
half of its calls are outside normal banking hours. It is even open on
Christmas day. The Co-op says its busiest time is between 10 am and 11am on
Mondays and its daily peak is between 4.30 pm and 5.30 pm - obviously, even
though most services use local rate telephone numbers, many customers prefer
to call on company time.
When banks offer a personal telephone service as an add-on to standard
branch-based accounts, the service is usually free (apart from the cost of
the call), and account charges are the same as usual. You may have to pay
extra for computer-linked services, particularly if you need a special
terminal. Telephone-only accounts - such as First Direct or NatWest's
PrimeLine - will have different charging structures from the bank's other
accounts, so you will need to check whether they are good value for your
pattern of use.
Security is a concern for many people. All telephone banking systems use
passwords or personal identification numbers, and usually other pieces of
personal information, such as your mother's maiden name or a memorable date.
Although not all the information will be requested each time you make a
call, it is better not to make a habit of calling frequently within earshot
of the same person.
One other worry is what happens in cases when there is a dispute between you
and the bank over your instructions - you do not have the comfort of a
stamped cheque stub or bill as proof of your transaction. It is sensible to
make your own notes on each phone call. If the bank says it has no record of
your request, what do you do?
Some telephone banks, such as First Direct and Barclays, prevent such
problems by tape-recording all calls. Others just tape a proportion or make
notes. The Co-op sends written confirmation of all telephone transactions,
so that any discrepancies can be caught early.

FT  15 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: Pension loophole closes - The
Finance Bill contains a nasty surprise for some Furbs holders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBBIE HARRISON and SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Finance Bill, which turns the Budget into law and was released this
week, sometimes manages to slip in previously unannounced details.
In the case of 'unapproved' pension schemes, the Finance Bill closed a
loophole that previously allowed high earners to use these schemes to
achieve tax-free roll-up of the fund and a tax-free lump sum benefit.
It went a stage further than the Budget, which referred specifically to
offshore 'Furbs' (funded unapproved retirement benefit schemes), where the
pension trust was sited in Jersey or Guernsey. The new anti-avoidance
measures also include insurance-based schemes set up in the UK which channel
funds into foreign insurance policies to avoid tax on the growth of the
fund.
Furbs were designed to top up pensions for employees caught by the 'earnings
cap', currently Pounds 75,000 rising to Pounds 76,800 for the 1994 / 95 tax
year.
The main difference between standard company schemes and Furbs is that
contributions to approved schemes benefit from tax relief, the pension fund
grows free of income and capital gains tax, while the pension itself is
taxed as income, although a proportion of the fund can be taken as a tax
free cash lump sum.
Under a Furbs, the employee is taxed on the employer's contributions which
are treated as a benefit in kind, the fund is subject to income and capital
gains tax, but the whole of the benefit can be taken as a tax free lump sum
on retirement.
However, a loophole in the law allowed employers to establish a Furbs
offshore to achieve tax free roll up of the fund in addition to the other
advantages. The Budget blocked this tax avoidance route for any scheme set
up after 30 November 1993. For new Furbs, the employee's top rate of tax
will be charged on the difference between total contributions paid in and
the total fund that emerges at retirement. In this way the tax treatment of
offshore Furbs will be brought into line with onshore Furbs.
Some Furbs based in the UK have sought to avoid income and capital gains tax
by moving the fund abroad. This was achieved by redirecting the employer's
contributions paid to the UK trust into unit-linked policies of foreign
insurance companies. In some cases further tax charges on the employer were
avoided by using the premiums to purchase 'deferred annuities' - contracts
that guarantee to pay a regular income for life with effect from a specified
future date.
John Mackay, a senior tax manager with accountant Ernst &amp; Young, said that
these arrangements were also caught by the Finance Bill which he described
as having a 'cluster bomb' effect on Furbs. 'Moreover,' he warned,
'previously benefits could be taken in the form of insurance policies but
now the only way to guarantee tax free status is to take cash.'
Investors in gilts through a unit trust will be able to use the capital
gains tax indexation allowance to mitigate gains, according to a clause in
the finance bill, writes Scheherazade Daneshkhu.
Investors in assets normally exempt from capital gains tax, such as gilts,
have had to pay the tax when these assets are held in a unit trust or
offshore fund.
Wealthier investors who pay CGT, may now find it worthwhile to invest in
gilts through a bond fund, despite the charges, in order to use indexation.
However, indexation can only be used to reduce gains. In the November
Budget, the chancellor abolished the use of indexation to create or increase
losses.

FT  15 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: Insurers hold bonuses static
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More insurance companies announced their 1994 bonus rates for with-profits
policies this week. The general trend is still for static or slightly lower
bonuses, although a few insurers have announced special additional bonuses
for longer-term policies.
Actual maturity values for policies paying out this year are mostly lower
for 10-year terms, but there are both slight increases and minor cuts over
25 years.
Many insurers have warned that bonus rates are likely to fall over the next
few years, as investment returns are expected to be lower.
Guardian Royal Exchange, which no longer sells with-profits endowments, is
the lowest payer so far: the maturity value of a 10-year policy, taken out
by a man aged 29 paying Pounds 30 a month, is Pounds 4,952, while a 25-year
policy is worth Pounds 44,379. Sun Alliance is better, at Pounds 6,115 and
Pounds 52,640, both of which are up a little from last year.
Scottish Mutual has increased payouts over both 10 and 25 year terms. The
10-year pay-out is Pounds 6,785, up 2.6 per cent, and the 25-year figure is
Pounds 63,205, up 14.7 per cent.
Commercial Union improved its 25-year pay-out by 4.2 per cent to Pounds
65,599, the highest 25-year pay-out announced so far this year, while its
10-year pay-out is Pounds 6,807, down 5 per cent but still better than
average. The highest 10-year pay-outs so far are from Royal London, at
Pounds 7,198, and the Royal National Pension Fund for Nurses, at Pounds
7,060, though it revises its rates in April.
NPI, which specialises in pensions business, has cut pay-outs by an average
of 5 per cent. A sum of Pounds 10,000 paid into a 10-year single-premium
pension plan, for a man retiring at age 65, would now be worth Pounds
35,508, down 10 per cent, while a 25-year policy would pay Pounds 169,366,
up 2 per cent.

FT  15 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: Analysts expect - The Week Ahead
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
On Thursday analysts will be expecting a good rise in interim profits from
Carpetright, from about Pounds 5.2m to Pounds 5.5m, although as it was not a
public company a year ago, forecasting numbers is difficult. But last
October the company said sales had been above expectations since the May 1
year end.
Gestetner Holdings, the office and photographic equipment distributor, is
expected to announce full-year pre-tax losses of up to Pounds 38m on
Thursday after taking a Pounds 48.3m provision at the interim stage, mainly
to cover the restructuring of its European operations.
The results will be the last before Inchcape, which bought a 15.3 per cent
stake in Gestetner in May, must decide whether to exercise its option to
acquire convertible unsecured loan stock enabling it to lift its stake to
24.6 per cent.
The exercise price on the option, which expires on July 1, is equal to 172p
a share - well above the current 140p level.
On Tuesday Photo-Me International, the world's largest photo-booth
manufacturer and operator, is likely to report first-half pre-tax profits
little changed from last years' level of Pounds 10.5m.
Slack summer demand for Christmas goods is expected to hold back the
performance of Park Food Group, which specialises in supplying Yuletide
hampers through a network of commission-paid agents.
Analysts are predicting interim losses on Friday of at least Pounds 4m in
the six months to September 30 compared with a Pounds 3.69m pre-tax loss at
the half-way stage in 1992.

FT  15 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: The people you need to know in the
City - Scheherazade Daneshkhu and Bethan Hutton offer names and addresses
for savers and investors who need advice, information or help
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU and BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The world of personal finance is complicated and it can be difficult for
individuals new to the subject to find out where to look for advice, where
to find information if they want to go it alone, and where to complain if it
all goes wrong.
The financial services industry is always changing but the sources of
information are more constant. We offer below a guide to the more common
areas of personal finance.
FINANCIAL ADVICE
Independent financial advisers fall into two main categories: those who are
remunerated by commission and those who charge fees. Finance and the Family
has always recommended fee-based advice to ensure there is no conflict
between an adviser's need to make a living and the quality of advice he
gives to the client. Our sister publication Money Management keeps a list of
fee-based advisers. The complete list costs Pounds 1,000 + VAT but if you
simply want the names of advisers in your area, state you postcode and a
shorter list will be sent to you free of charge.
The Registry of Financial Planning is a list of IFAs, indicating which are
fee-based and is available free. IFA Promotion, which was established in
1992, operates a consumer telephone line (0483-461461), and can send
inquirers an information pack and the names of six local IFAs. However, most
will be remunerated by commission.

Hereford House, East Street, Hereford HR1 2LU. 0432-274-891.
PERFORMANCE FIGURES
If you have investments in unit or investment trusts, you can check on the
unit or share price in the FT every day, but you may also want to find out
how they compare with similar funds. Finance and the Family uses fund
performance statistics from two agencies: Hardwick Stafford Wright and
Micropal. They each produce a range of statistics every month, with separate
packs on investment trusts, unit trusts, offshore funds, pension funds and
so on. However, subscriptions are expensive for the private investor: HSW
charges Pounds 150 a year per type of fund, for example. Most private
investors would not need that amount of detail every month.
HSW, London &amp; Manchester House, Park Green, Macclesfield, Cheshire, SK11
7NG. 0625-511311.
Micropal has launched a monthly publication Investment Tracker, giving
performance figures for unit and investment trusts, pension funds, popular
share issues and stock market indices. The cost is Pounds 40 for a single
copy or Pounds 380 pa. Micropal, Commonwealth House, 2 Chalkhill Rd, London
W6 8DW. 081-741-4100.
An alternative is the FT publication, Money Management, which is aimed
mostly at professional financial advisers, but can be useful for the keen
amateur. It runs surveys of financial products, is published monthly, and
includes performance tables of unit and investment trusts, investment funds
and sterling-converted offshore funds over different periods. A single issue
costs Pounds 4.50. (For address, see Financial Advice, above.)
Chase de Vere publishes an annual guide to Peps, costing Pounds 9.95,
refundable if you buy a Pep through the firm. Half yearly performance guides
cost Pounds 2. Chase de Vere, 63 Lincoln's Inn Fields, London, WC2A 3JX.
071-404-5766.
SAVINGS/MORTGAGE RATES
Where do you look if you want to know who is offering the best mortgage
deal, or where you can earn the highest interest rates on your savings?
Moneyfacts is the source of the 'Highest rates for your money' table which
we publish every week. It also publishes a highly detailed monthly guide to
bank and building society accounts, mortgages, loans, credit cards, National
Savings and so on. An annual subscription costs Pounds 38.50, but for a free
sample copy, call 0692-500677.
SHARE INFORMATION
ProShare, the body which was set up with government funding to promote wider
share ownership, has a Guide to Information Sources for the Private
Investor. The list includes newspapers and reference books as well as
telephone information lines (such as FT Cityline), investment analysis
software and TV share-price information, such as Ceefax and Teletext.
The Guide evaluates the source of information for simple language, value for
money, ease of use and whether it is up-to-date. It is free to ProShare
members but otherwise costs Pounds 4.95 + 50p p&amp;p.
ProShare Association, Library Chambers, 13 &amp; 14 Basinghall Street, London
EC2V 5BQ. 071-600-0984.
The New Issue Register is a database which aims to give private investors
privileged treatment in new share issues. Membership entitles you to a
monthly newsletter and a telephone hotline which gives notice of forthcoming
issues as well as information about the new issue market. Annual membership
is Pounds 75 plus VAT.
Butlers Wharf Business Centre, 45 Curlew Street, London SE1 2ND.
071-357-6608.
STOCKBROKERS
through personal recommendation, the Association of Private Client
Investment Managers and Stockbrokers has a free directory of private client
stockbrokers which gives details of the services offered by its members.
Apcims, 112 Middlesex St, London, E1 7HY. Call 0891-335521 for the
directory.
COMPLAINTS
There are so many regulators and ombudsmen in the financial services
industry that the difficulty of finding the right person to complain to can
deter some people.
The procedure for complaints is always to approach the company first, and
only after that, the relevant self-regulatory body. The final stage is to
take the matter to the ombudsman, if there is one. Keep photocopies of all
correspondence.
You can find out which body is responsible for the firm about which you wish
to complain by calling the central register hotline of the Securities and
Investments Board, the chief regulatory body, on 071-929-3652.
SIB also has a number of useful free pamphlets which include: Background to
Investor Protection, How to Spot the Investment Cowboys, Investment
Business: What to do if you need to complain, Compensation for Investors.

LOST INVESTMENTS
certificates, insurance documents, building society passbooks or similar and
want to know what they are worth, first write to the last known address for
the company or organisation. If that produces nothing, write to the
appropriate industry body (see above), to find out whether the company is
still in business, or has changed name, merged or collapsed. After that,
more detective work may be necessary, using back copies of yearbooks and
newspapers.
INDUSTRY BODIES
These are associations for companies or institutions with a similar purpose.
They often act as public spokesmen on general policy, and can also be a
useful source of information on their industry and members, but are not the
right destination for complaints. Most prefer communication in writing.
Association of British Insurers: 51, Gresham Street, London EC2V 7HQ.

National Conference of Friendly Societies, Park Gate, 21 Tothill Street,
London, SW1H 9LL.
Register of Friendly Societies: 15, Great Marlborough Street, London, W1V
2AX.
DEBT
can be frightening and embarrassing. If you think debts are getting on top
of you, first seek help at a Citizens Advice Bureau or Money Advice Centre
(look in the phone book for your local office). Many CABs have specialist
money advisers.
The National Debtline, in Birmingham, is a telephone advice service which
can talk you through problems, and also sends out information packs. It is
staffed Mondays and Thursdays 10-4pm, and Tuesdays and Wednesdays 2-7pm.
There is an answering machine at other times. Tel: 021-359-8501

FT  15 JAN 94 / Markets: If we do go back to basics . . . - London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Politicians are not alone in finding it hard to shun instant gratification
and get back to basics. With the siren song of falling interest rates fading
in their ears, equity investors spent most of the week worrying that the
stock market lacked the stimulus to keep up its robust performance.
Any hopes of another base rate cut were deferred until the Spring by a
clutch of good economic statistics: the unemployment rate is below 10 per
cent for the first time in 18 months, consumer credit is highest and housing
starts strongest in three years.
Good news - 46,800 unemployed people back to work in December, earning money
to spend and saving taxpayers the dole - temporarily became bad news. The
FT-SE 100 lost 86 points in four days before strong corporate results and
other fundamentals reasserted themselves on Friday and the index bounced
40.6 points to close at 3,400.6.
While John Major might hanker for a simpler and semi-mythological 1950s
lifestyle, economists and investors can at least quantify the good old days
they believe are here again.
'Over the next three to four years, the performance of the UK economy could
resemble the halcyon days of low inflation and sustained trend economic
growth that characterised the period from the mid-1950s to the end of the
1960s,' said David Shaw, Legal &amp; General's director of investment strategy,
this week.
Trouble is, some of the market basics in such a scenario are very
challenging. As the chart shows, the historic p/e ratio of industrial stocks
is fast approaching the all-time record of 23.1 of January, 1969. Never mind
the past, look to future earnings, is the response of many strategists. But
even here the market is pushing the limits. The prospective p/e ratio is
around 15.5, the highest, Warburg's points out, in 20 years of their record
keeping.
Moreover, the rise in equity valuation has been heavily underpinned by the
decline in interest rates over the past four years. There is every chance of
shaving interest rates by another half point or so this year but after that
share prices are on their own. They will have to sustain themselves on
rising earnings and dividends.
But, even as stocks soared after last November's budget, analysts were
scaling back their forecasts. In December alone, the consensus forecast for
pre-exceptional earnings growth of the FT-SE 500 dropped from 14.3 per cent
to 12.6 per cent.
Perhaps this was the last gasp of pessimism and caution for analysts and
companies after a protracted period of economic recovery hopes deferred. On
balance, profit downgrades have out numbered upgrades for four years, says
Paul Walton, Capel's market strategist.
'Analysts' profit forecasts are far too low,' he argues. Moreover, companies
are being very timid with their turnover and profits predictions. Pre-tax
profit growth of about 15 per cent this year (against 3 per cent in 1992 and
19 per cent last year) would consist of about seven percentage points of
turnover growth, about three to four points from interest rate and currency
effects and only four to five points from lower input costs. But with a more
realistic view of turnover and costs, profit growth closer to 25 per cent is
possible, he argues. Indeed, a Dun and Bradstreet survey this week found
companies salivating at the prospect of raising prices.
Similarly, there is plenty of scope or dividend per share growth to
accelerate to 7-10 per cent this year from 6 per cent last year and zero in
1992.
Thus, the upcoming corporate results season is even more important than
usual for sustaining current market levels. Fortunately, first indications
were highly encouraging. TSB, Tomkins, Rank Organisation and Securicor all
reported much better than expected earnings and dividends.
TSB was the most impressive with full year pre-tax profits jumping from
Pounds 5m to Pounds 301m the dividend rising 20 per cent against forecasts
of 9.5 per cent. Yes, profits soared thanks to a near-halving of bad debt
provisions while operating profits were only ahead 11 per cent but it is
clear TSB and other banks are heading for an embarrassment of riches.
Tomkins turned in doubled interim pre-tax profits of Pounds 93.8m, about
Pounds 5m better than forecast, and a reasonable dividend rise. The City
remains, however, cool to its takeover of Rank Hovis McDougall, the foods
group it acquired for Pounds 990.5m in December. Investors still see it as a
baker of loss-leading white bread for supermarkets, a tag justified by the
measly profits from baking.
Rank Organisation also surprised the market with full-year pre-tax profits
of Pounds 276.6m, more than doubled the restated year earlier figures.
Although consumers might be holding back a bit on their regular leisure
spending Rank squeezed more operating profits out of bingo and casinos.
Like Rank, First Leisure has had to work the crowds harder but at least its
modest increase in profits reported this week helped allay market fears. Its
shares, once buoyed by the notion First Leisure was defying recession, had
fallen from 378p in March to 234p in November on fears its discos and
bowling lanes were failing to hold their own. Shares are now trading on the
more realistic multiple equal to the market's.
In matters of market pricing, however, the prize of the week went to
Eurotunnel. It came up with a top charge of Pounds 310 for whisking a car
and its occupants through the tunnel on mid-summer weekends. Ferry operators
breathed a sigh of relief and investors marked down the shares.
Eurotunnel offers travel to an 'unlimited' number of passengers per car. So
enterprising crammers could establish some remarkable passenger/excursion
ratios. The bigger task lies with Eurotunnel. No other company will have to
work so hard to justify its share price.

FT  15 JAN 94 / Markets: Tax change hits EZTs - At a glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Investors will find it more difficult to shelter tax through Enterprise Zone
Trusts, as a result of a tax change announced this week. Industry experts
believe that the number of new EZTs being launched could be halved as a
result of the rule change, which will restrict the appeal of EZTs to
investors who are prepared to hold the investment for a full 25 years.
The government acted to stop a loophole in its legislation on capital
allowances which allowed property owners to offer investors an exit route
from an EZT before the end of the trust's 25 year life. Existing trusts are
not affected.

FT  15 JAN 94 / Markets: Bombay stocks soar - At a glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bombay Stock Exchange's index of 30 leading shares has risen almost 50
per cent since the start of November, in a rally triggered by foreign fund
managers allowed to invest for the first time in years.
The gains were in spite of the market being closed for two weeks last month
because of a regulatory dispute over forward trading. The last big rally in
1992 ended in a stock exchange scandal involving brokers and foreign and
domestic banks.
India could be the next big area in emerging markets for UK investors,
according to specialist brokers Olliff and Partners.

FT  15 JAN 94 / Markets: House prices rise in final quarter of '93 - At a
glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
House prices across the UK were an average of 2.9 per cent higher in the
final quarter of 1993 than in the same period of 1992, according to the
Nationwide building society. Prices were higher in nine regions out of 13.
The highest increase was 11 per cent in Scotland, while the north-west
recorded a fall of 4.4 per cent.
Fourth quarter prices were marginally lower than in the third quarter of
1993, down 0.1 per cent on average, although London buyers paid 5.1 per cent
more than in the previous three months.
The average price paid by first time buyers in the fourth quarter was Pounds
39,909, while previous owner-occupiers paid Pounds 65,697 on average.

FT  15 JAN 94 / Markets: Just one stop for unit trust investors - Serious
Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Weekend FT readers know that this newspaper welcomes any efforts to make
life simpler for investors and to reduce the costs of financial services
products.
This week, Fidelity Brokerage, part of Fidelity Investments, the large US
fund management group, launched a new service which should make buying and
selling unit trusts easier and, in many cases, cheaper too.
Funds MarketPlace is a brokerage service through which you can buy any of
the 1,400 or so UK-based unit trusts. This is a 'one-stop' dealing account
particularly suited to those who want to buy unit trusts from different fund
management groups.
Most private investors buy unit trusts either through a financial adviser or
directly from each company. Fidelity, which provides a single account
service in the US, has spotted a gap in the UK market for a similar product.
So how will it work?
You open a Funds MarketPlace Account with Fidelity and use a 0800 number for
dealing. Fidelity handles the settlement, dividends and reporting and will
send you a portfolio statement every six months.
The units are held in a designated nominee account. They can be in your own
name but the disadvantage is that Fidelity will then charge commission on
sales, even though unit trusts do not normally impose a selling charge.
There is no selling charge for units held in a designated nominee account.
How much does Fidelity charge for this service? The cost of buying a unit
trust is reflected in its initial charge, which is usually about 5.25 per
cent, and includes the commission which the fund managers pay to
intermediaries for selling the trust - the industry norm is 3 per cent.
Since Fidelity is acting as an intermediary, it will receive the 3 per cent
commission in any case and therefore does not need to make an extra charge
on the investor.
What about unit trusts with low initial charges? Murray Johnstone and Lazard
have cut their initial charges while others, such as Fidelity, M &amp; G,
Gartmore and Cazenove, have lowered the initial charge on some or all of
their unit trust personal equity plans. However, since most of the companies
sell the bulk of their unit trusts through financial advisers, they are
continuing to pay intermediaries 3 per cent.
A handful of equity funds pay less than 3 per cent commission. Murray
Johnstone only pays 1 per cent commission to intermediaries on its range of
unit trusts; currency and bond funds pay little or no commission. Fidelity
says that in these cases it will charge the investor its usual commission
rates. It admits that it will be cheaper for the investor to buy these funds
directly but hopes that the convenience of its one-stop service will
outweigh the charge.
Fidelity will give discounts off the initial charge to those making large
purchases. Although reduced brokerage rates are common for large unit trust
transactions, the deals usually have to be well over the Pounds 5,000
starting rate which Fidelity is proposing.
The discounts are on a sliding scale. There is a reduction of 1 per cent for
purchases of Pounds 5,000-Pounds 10,000, 1.5 per cent for Pounds
10,001-Pounds 20,000, 2 per cent for Pounds 20,001-Pounds 40,000, 2.5 per
cent for Pounds 40,001-Pounds 100,000 and 3 per cent on deals of Pounds
100,001 and above. However, for trusts with an initial charge of between 3
to 5.25 per cent, Fidelity will reduce the discounts so that the scale will
be between 0.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. There will be no discounts for unit
trusts which pay less than the 3 per cent commission.
The other point to note is that since Fidelity is an 'execution-only'
broker, you do not receive any investment advice although you can use the
0800 number to ask for basic information such as the performance history of
the trust, the name of its manager and the date the fund was launched.
Only 4 per cent of UK households own unit trusts (compared to 25 per cent in
the US) but Fidelity believes the market will continue to expand strongly
against the background of lower interest rates. 1993 was the best year ever
for collective funds raising new money and Fidelity thinks that an
increasing proportion of that market will be buying funds on an
execution-only basis.
Certainly, this has been the pattern with retail equity deals. In 1987-88,
only 5 to 6 per cent of sales and purchases of individual stocks and shares
in the retail market were done on an execution-only basis but that has now
risen to about 30-33 per cent.
Although only 8 per cent of retail unit trust sales were bought directly
last year, Fidelity is predicting that this will grow to 20-25 per cent of
the market in the next 2-3 years.
Choosing a unit trust without taking financial advice is not a good idea
unless you know what you are doing. Even if you have run through the
arguments and have decided that a unit, rather than investment, trust is for
you, choosing between the wide variety of regions and different types of
funds is not easy. Moreover, performance figures may not be readily
available but in the article on page III, we list some of the ways of
finding out.
Active investors dabbling in large sums are the ones most likely to find
Funds MarketPlace, and similar products which may be spawned in its wake,
worthwhile.

FT  15 JAN 94 / Markets: It's eyes down in the casino - The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After 18 months of falling dividend yields, UK banks have come to resemble
slot machines into which gamblers have put lots of coins without result. A
small crowd has gathered in the stock market casino to watch for the
long-anticipated moment when the bells ring, and money starts gushing out.
The fall in the banks' dividend yield against the FT-A All Share index has
been produced by the heady rise in bank shares over the past 18 months. The
sector's performance has rewarded many investors who bet on banks recovering
from the bad debt burden of the 1980s with very strong capital gain.
These gains were sustained last year by the emergence of exceptional trading
conditions. The fall in interest rates not only allowed banks to widen
margins on loans, but produced turmoil in currency and securities markets
which allowed banks' securities arms to profit heavily.
Yet after TSB's announcement this week of full-year pre-tax profits of
Pounds 301m, accompanied by a 20 per cent increase in the dividend,
sentiment is changing. Brokers' analysts think the best capital gains are
past, and investors should look towards banks' ability to raise dividends.
That was reinforced by movements in bank shares yesterday, with Abbey
National gaining 13p to 520p on hopes that it would follow TSB in raising
its 1993 dividend sharply. Along with TSB, Abbey is one of the
best-capitalised banks, with a ratio of core capital to risk-weighted assets
of 9.4 per cent.
Peter Toeman, of Hoare Govett, says banks have undergone a miraculous
transformation because of their share rise, from being among the highest
yielding sectors to the fifth lowest-yielding one. This is because investors
anticipate that they will use accumulating capital to raise dividends.
During the 1980s bank shares were bought for income from dividends rather
than capital gains because banks are highly cyclical. They yielded between
1.4 and 1.6 times the All-Share throughout the 1980s. The steady fall to
yesterday's 20 per cent yield discount started about three years ago.
Toeman says that this discount - unusual for banks - has emerged because
banks are seen to be building up capital which will be used to raise
dividends to parity with the All-Share. 'Investors are driven by this
expectation and are trying to work out the best prospects,' he says.
The broad potential of banks to raise dividends is already clear. Three
banks - Barclays, Standard Chartered, and Midland - cut dividends during the
recession. Because domestic loan is likely to remain weak, the banks which
are now generating cash are unlikely to absorb it by growing their assets.
Even with five per cent growth in risk-weighted assets, Hugh Pye, an analyst
at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, estimates that Lloyds Bank would reach a core
capital ratio of 8.1 per cent by 1995. This is both double the regulatory
minimum of 4 per cent, and well above the comfort level of 6 per cent.
Judging banks on dividend growth potential implies looking for those with
strong capital, and the best chance of raising operating profits. Pye says
this implies a switch 'from recovery to quality' - from banks like Barclays
and National Westminster to those with better growth prospects.
Abhey, TSB, HSBC Holdings and Royal Bank of Scotland all have strong capital
already. Toeman argues that TSB shares are still cheap because its capital
means it is capable of raising the dividend at a compound rate of 20 per
cent a year if the bank's management absorbs capital in this way.
Pye says investors should look for banks which not only have strong capital
but can increase operating income in an era of weak demand. He says that
Abbey is strongly placed in this respect because it has a good market share
in home mortgages.
But judging banks on dividend potential means taking the risk that
managements of well-capitalised banks will not opt simply to retain the
cash. As the wily slot machine gambler knows, a machine's failure to pay out
in the past does not guarantee that it will do so in future.

FT  15 JAN 94 / Markets: Everything in the garden is perfect, but . . . -
Wall Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This may not necessarily be a good thing, but some Wall Street sages have
been pointing out lately that conditions in the US stock market are
currently as near to perfect as is possible.
The economy is growing at a solid pace. Inflation, primarily because of the
moderate rate of economic growth, is unthreatening. Interest rates, although
edging higher, are still near historic lows. Company earnings continue to
improve, thanks in part to vigorous cost containment measures and efficiency
gains, and Corporate America's balance sheet is as healthy as it has been
for a long time.
Even the dollar is perking up, which may not be good for US exporters trying
to sell their goods abroad, but it does at least attract capital to US
financial markets.
Moreover, the poor recent performance of some of last year's hottest foreign
stock markets - notably Mexico and Hong Kong - is also working in the US
market's favour, as it may cool investors' ardour for overseas equities and
persuade them to keep more of their money at home.
Also, there are few signs that the individual investor is losing interest in
the stock market.
Investment managers report that money continues to flood into mutual funds,
money that the institutions have been quickly putting to use by investing in
equities, particularly the stocks of companies whose earnings are closely
tied to the economic cycle.
The cash inflows from funds, coupled with the mood of optimism about the
economy and corporate earnings, has been behind the stock market's
impressive performance in the first two weeks of 1994.
Apart from a few days of profit-taking, share prices have been appreciating
steadily since the New Year. In the first six days of January alone the Dow
Jones Industrial Average climbed more than 100 points, or almost 3 per cent,
as the Dow broke through 3,800 for the first time.
Several days of modest selling earlier this week did little to damp the
market's fire, and yesterday the buying resumed. By late morning the Dow was
up another 25 points, all but erasing the previous three day's losses.
More and more analysts are now talking of the Dow reaching 4,000 within a
few months, and some are even suggesting it will make 4,500 before the year
is out.
Yet, the skies above the stock market are not entirely cloud-free.
The Dow may have started the year in grand style, but other indices have
lagged behind. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500, the Nasdaq composite and the
Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks have performed only half as well
as the Dow.
This suggests that investors' confidence in the market is not particularly
broad-based.
Then there is the matter of equity valuations. Stocks on the S&amp;P 500 are
currently trading at about 23-times past earnings, and paying out a dividend
yield of 2.6 per cent. Those figures are both well off historic averages,
which are about 14-times earnings and a 4.4 per cent dividend yield. The
bears in the market say it is only a matter of time before valuations start
coming back toward historic averages, and that is more likely to happen as a
result of a sharp decline in share prices, rather than a dramatic
improvement in earnings performance.
Finally, the threat of inflation still hovers in the distance. While the
current inflation rate is low - figures released this week showed that
consumer prices rose last year by 2.7 per cent, the best inflation
performance since 1986 - investors in fixed-income assets such as government
securities remain concerned that the steadily accelerating pace of economic
growth will eventually feed through into higher prices, and start eroding
the value of their investments.
That concern pushed bond yields higher in the latter half of this week.
After falling to as low as 6.18 per cent on Wednesday, the yield on the
benchmark 30-year bond had moved back up to 6.3 per cent by midday
yesterday, spooked by an unexpectedly strong December retail sales report.
What is more, the stock market's own inflation warning bell - the Dow Jones
Utilities Average - has been ringing recently. The average of 15 utilities
stocks has fallen 3.7 per cent since the start of the year. Utility stocks
are uniquely sensitive to inflationary trends, because when inflation rises,
utility companies' earnings suffer because their ability to put up their
rates to counter the impact of inflation is restricted by the government.
This is not to suggest that a big correction in share prices is imminent,
only to note that conditions in the stock market are rarely, if ever,
perfect.

FT  15 JAN 94 / The Long View: You shall go to the ball
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Cinderella asset is back in favour. Property may be lagging a long way
behind the securities markets but it is beginning to share in their
buoyancy. Institutional investors in the UK are becoming active buyers of
commercial real estate once again, and in the residential market prices are
starting to creep higher on a year-on-year basis, although the level of
transactions remains low compared with the halcyon days of the late 1980s.
But first, it is worth highlighting how much the property market has slipped
behind the stock and bond markets. Last year, even though commercial
property prices began to rise, and according to the property agents Healey &amp;
Baker, average prime investment yields declined from 8.5 to 7.0 per cent,
the investment returns were still relatively poor. Average total returns for
1993 are being estimated at 13 or 14 per cent, compared with 28 per cent on
UK equities and more than 30 per cent on long-dated gilts.
The average 1993 return on the portfolios of UK pension funds - which these
days only have about 5 per cent of their assets in UK property - was 28 per
cent.
But property follows a rather different cycle. Its last boom year was in
1988 when it returned 30 per cent, while the average pension fund's asset
mix produced only 12 per cent. In the last three years property has suffered
a hangover while equity and bond prices have roared ahead: compared with the
aggregate 86 per cent return in three years on UK equities, UK real estate
has returned only 7 per cent.
A similar deviation has been seen in residential property, where prices
bottomed out last year. As investments, houses have performed very poorly
Since 1989, losing about 10 per cent of their value nationally and more than
20 per cent in the harder-hit south-east of England. Yet since the end of
1988, remember, share prices have shown capital growth of some 80 per cent.
Clearly the smart private investor would have sold his house in the late
1980s, rented a place and switched his wealth into stocks. Housing is for
nesting, not investing, according to today's wisdom. It is, however, time to
be considering the reverse transaction.
Why do financial assets and property assets behave so differently? Clearly
it is because they are influenced by different kinds of investors and are
valued on different bases. This ought not to be so true of commercial
property which is owned by the same institutions that dominate the
securities markets (and which ought to be capable of valuing assets on a
consistent basis). But the supply of property is erratic because of the role
of speculative developers.
Essentially the securities markets are driven by flows of cash. They tend to
be buoyant in the early part of the economic cycle when there is surplus
liquidity and interest rates are low; this was the case in 1993. But the
real estate market is dominated by borrowed money - whether household
mortgages or bank loans to real estate developers. So property prices tend
to be strong in the later part of the cycle, when people are confident
enough to accumulate debt. For several years the banks have been so battered
by losses on loans to the property industry that the flow of cash has dried
to a trickle. As for houses, mortgage lending remains weak: from a peak of
Pounds 40bn in 1988 net advances have declined and were much less than half
that figure in 1993.
The fundamentals in property also change according to a different time
scale. For instance, the occupation of commercial property continued to be
affected by weak demand in 1993, when prime rents fell by about 7 per cent.
There are substantial time lags in the completion of developments conceived
in past booms and in the renegotiation of old leases. In contrast, the pain
in most listed non-property companies was experienced earlier: by last year
demand was beginning to rebuild and profits were recovering. Dividends have
not fallen overall, in contrast to the income on investment property.
Different rules apply, but there is an awkward interface of the property and
securities markets in the property sector of the stock market. This has been
booming, to the extent of producing some of the best returns in the equity
market. You can rationalise this in terms of a turnround in medium-term
expectations, but it is probably more simply explained by the conflicting
pressures on investors. There are still important structural barriers
between securities investors and direct property investors even when they
co-exist in the same institutions.
It is no more than a particular case of the general rule that the flood of
global liquidity into the stock market has greatly raised share prices
relative to the valuation of the underlying assets that listed companies
own. If economic growth continues, as optimists assume, property values will
eventually catch up with what the stock market is projecting. Indeed, a lot
of institutional buyers are now drawing the conclusion that property is
cheap. Given that long-term sterling interest rates have tumbled from 8 3/4
to 6 1/2 per cent, a substantial fall in property investment yields was also
inevitable. However, property professionals have found it hard to take on
board this purely financial adjustment at a time when the rental market has
remained depressed. If the valuers were up to date it is possible that the
property investment market would have shown better returns last year than
those now estimated. There is inevitably a strong element of subjectivity.
What about the residential market? This is still further separated from the
lush revenues that are pushing up securities values. It tends to be younger
people who bid up house prices and, by and large, they have few stock market
investments. The squeeze on employee earnings is benefiting corporate
profits and at the same time is holding back the borrowing capacity of home
buyers. But the cycle has turned.

FT  15 JAN 94 / The greatest person who ever lived . . . perhaps: Malcolm
Rutherford asked FT readers to nominate the most important figure from
history. The answers caught him by surprise. Here he sifts through the
replies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Be not afraid of greatness: Some men are born great, some achieve
greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon them.' From Shakespeare's
Twelfth Night.
'Some village Hampden, that with dauntless breast The little Tyrant of the
fields withstood; Some mute inglorious Milton here may rest, Some Cromwell
guiltless of his country's blood.' From Gray's Elegy Written in a Country
Church-Yard.
I was about to write an article on why Shakespeare was the greatest person
who ever lived when some down-to-earth colleagues suggested that we should
pose the question in the Weekend FT. And what a brave new world we would
live in if it were peopled entirely by FT readers, especially those who
responded to the competition.
We would listen to Beethoven and Mozart, understand the principles of
Newtonian physics, have mutual respect for each other's religions and do a
great deal of reading. But we wouldn't be arrogant: we might even have a
sense of humour.
Economists, politicians, potentates and generals - with the possible
exception of Ghenghis Kahn, who is admired for his efficiency - would be
ignored. Our greatest living hero would be Mother Teresa.
When we set the competition, I remained convinced that there were only two
main runners: Shakespeare and Jesus Christ, with the Bard as the clear
favourite. That was because there have been other great religious leaders
apart from Christ and the paper's readership is very international.
Shakespeare, by contrast, is universal and uncontroversial, unchallenged as
a playwright and a lasting contributor to the English language. Above all,
he had the greatest understanding of the infinite variety of human nature.
Thus I thought that the religious vote would split, leaving Shakespeare out
in front.
On one part of the guess, I was completely wrong. Shakespeare, though
mentioned many times in passing, received rather fewer votes than Walt
Disney. In extenuation, I should add that Disney was praised for one of the
same reasons I would have given for the Bard: namely the capacity to give
the greatest pleasure to the greatest number of people. Times change: Bambi
not Hamlet.
On religion, I was nearer the truth. Jesus Christ was the clear winner but -
wait for it - Mohammed was a good second and Buddha a close third. The
striking point about practically all those answers, however, was the
tolerance and understanding of other people's beliefs.
Contributors were asked not only to name the greatest person who ever lived
and, if they liked, the second greatest as well, but to give their reasons.
Time and again, someone who put Jesus Christ first would put Mohammed or
Buddha second, and vice versa. Moreover, their answers stressed not divinity
or after-life, but common humanity.
In many cases, the admiration for religious leaders went hand in hand with a
respect for science. No-one expressed the view that religious beliefs were
incompatible with scientific research. It was taken as axiomatic that the
two go together. One contributor argued for Mohammed as the greatest on the
grounds of his all-round abilities as a teacher, administrator and leader,
then put Albert Einstein second for discovering E=MC2. Another put Moses
first for establishing the idea of one God and one set of universally
accepted 'Laws of Man'; he, too, put Einstein second.
Writing from Woodbridge in Suffolk, David Drumm summed up the mixture: 'The
two greatest influences on mankind have been religion and science.'
Drumm named three people: Jesus Christ in third place, Mohammed in second
and Sir Isaac Newton as the greatest because Newton (1642-1727) 'supplied
the unified theory that set modern science on the course which it has
followed ever since and which revolutionised the world'.
Essentially, says Drumm, daily life for the world's population remained
fairly similar between 1600 BC and 1600 AD. After Newton the world was
changed.
In terms of first and second choices Newton tied with Beethoven in receiving
more support than anyone except a religious leader. Yet the problem with
choosing scientists was identified by Newton himself: 'The reason I see so
far is because I stand on the shoulders of giants.' It is hard to attribute
breakthroughs to individuals.
There is also great ignorance about the past. We do not know who invented
the wheel or discovered the domestic and productive use of fire - the latter
surely the greatest breakthrough of all time. We don't know for certain
either who invented the alphabet or designed a system of numbers, though
there was a very FT contribution in favour of Fra Luca Pacioli who put the
two together in the form of double-entry bookkeeping in the early 16th
century. Pacioli was a great friend of Leonardo da Vinci.
Nor are advances in pure science the only criteria for greatness: there are
also the technological advances that stem from them. A very strong if
slightly ironical case was made for Thomas Crapper, a Yorkshireman who moved
to Chelsea and invented the modern water closet in the mid 19th century.
Thus he added to life expectancy, public health and private comfort around
the world. A reader in Taipei suggests that Crapper represented the high
point of the British Empire and the industrial revolution.
Still on technology, there were several votes for Johannes Gutenberg
(1400-1468) and anyone to do with the invention of printing, including Ts'
Ai Lun who invented paper in China around 100 AD. Yet it is a bit like
plumbing; the spin-offs were enormous but someone was bound to invent it in
the end.
On music, I confess to a slight prejudice. However wonderful, even at its
best it reminds me of higher mathematics with feeling. It lacks the range,
the depth and the articulate, spoken humanity of Shakespeare. Beethoven and
Mozart cannot touch him, though I was glad that as composers they came out
ahead of all others.
So we come back to religious leaders. The reason why Jesus Christ did not
come out on top even more convincingly is partly that his followers are
divided about the extent of his personal greatness. Unlike Buddha and
Mohammed, as many contributors pointed out, he was foreshadowed by Moses,
predicted by John the Baptist and proselytised by St Paul. Without Paul, as
several readers argued, Christianity might not have taken root.
In the cynical language of Richard Koch from London SW7, it was Paul who
made Christianity 'Rome-friendly'. Under Paul's guidance 'religion became
activist and expansionist, both for the state and the individual'. Thus Paul
paved the way for western imperialism and capitalism, and - Koch might have
added - for resistance to abuse of power on grounds of conscience.
Other tributes to Christ are more straightforward. Sheila Leach wrote from
Northampton: 'The words he spoke changed our moral perspective . . . His
life and teaching provided the inspiration for art, architecture, music and
literature in western Europe after the fall of Rome . . . The change he
imposed on our thinking and the fountain he became for our creativity did
not depend on belief in his divinity.'
Yet the case for Christ is perhaps excessively Eurocentric. Two important
criteria for greatness are that it should stand the tests of time and
geographical reach. Buddha (563-483 BC) had the advantage of being born
earlier, yet is still being discovered far away from Asia. It was his
influence on subsequent religions 'and spiritual movements not properly
regarded as religious', wrote AE Lundquist from Oxford, that made him the
greatest person who ever lived.
Mohammed came later (507-632). Yet his essential teaching is not vastly
different from Christ or Buddha. He was anti-idolatry, like Moses. He
believed in repentance, prayer and alms-giving like Christ. He also believed
in education. As a reader from Damascus puts it: he rejected superstitions
'by teaching that the natural world is governed by a strict cause and effect
order'.
The same reader, who says he left his native country, Iraq, for fear of
persecution, might have added that whatever may be done in the name of
Islamic fundamentalism today, Christianity has also had its darker side. And
as Muhammad Saleem wrote from New York, Mohammed 'inculcated a love for
learning among illiterate Arabs which paved the way for outstanding
intellectual achievements, ultimately making them pioneers in the domain of
science and arts during medieval times'.
I think Christ and Mohammed are on a par: they had much in common, and were
all sometimes betrayed by over-zealous followers. If Buddha wins, it is by
coming first.
***
There remain the foot soldiers and anti-heroes. Some readers nominated Joe
Bloggs for putting up with it all for so long. David Brown from Shenfield in
Essex chose Murphy, the man whose law seem to be responsible for so much yet
remains inexplicable: 'If anything can go wrong, it will go wrong.'
And our winning contributors: David Brown for nominating Murphy, and Mrs
Patricia Atkinson of Loughborough for her moving nomination of Elizabeth
Fry, the 19th century prison reformer. A third and equal prize goes to David
Drumm for his sense of perspective.
The prizes are magnums of champagne. In the politest possible way some
Moslem readers objected to this. But what can we offer that will appeal to
all without being unduly extravagant? Next time the Complete Works of
Shakespeare.

FT  15 JAN 94 / Major denies significant role in guidelines on arms to Iraq
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major has told the Scott inquiry into the arms to Iraq affair that
he had no significant role in the setting or the adjustment of guidelines
regulating sales of defence-related equipment to the Baghdad regime.
In written evidence to the inquiry ahead of his appearance before Lord
Justice Scott on Monday, Mr Major emphasised that during his spells at the
Treasury and foreign office he was not party to the controversial relaxation
of the guidelines.
But with his political authority battered by the recent storms over his
'back to basics' policy and by the spate of political scandals, Mr Major
remains under intense pressure to give a confident and fluent performance at
the inquiry.
His appearance will coincide with the start of a Commons investigation on
the same day into an entirely separate but potentially equally embarrassing
deal under which Britain sold arms to Malaysia in the 1980s.
Amid signs of alarm among ministers about the investigation, the Public
Accounts Committee will cross-examine officials on evidence that a
large-scale weapons deal with Malaysia in 1989 was tied illegally by the
Thatcher government to a British aid package.
Officials said that the prime minister was 'entirely convinced' that the
mass of Whitehall documents covering the period when the Iraq exports
guidelines were in place confirmed his complete innocence of any misconduct.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, yesterday joined Mr
Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, in pledging to resign if he was found guilty
of misconduct by the Scott inquiry.
Both men signed certificates seeking to prevent secret government documents
being made available to the defence in the failed trial of directors of
Matrix Churchill over the sale of machine tools to Iraq. But both are
confident that the decision was entirely legitimate.
Mr Major is expected to tell the inquiry the only important decision with
which he was directly involved was when, as foreign secretary, he vetoed the
sale of military aircraft to Iraq in 1989.
The Labour party is determined to exploit his appearance to reinforce its
attack on the alleged 'sleaze' and 'hypocrisy' of government
decision-making. It claims that after he replaced Lady Thatcher in 1990 Mr
Major consistently misled MPs on the implementation of the guidelines.
Lord Justice Scott has indicated Mr Major will be cross-examined on Monday
on the background to those parliamentary answers. The prime minister may
face pressure to spell out whether his government had any role in
Wednesday's attack on the inquiry's procedures by former foreign secretary
Lord Howe.

FT  15 JAN 94 / Sharp increase in US production boosts shares to record
levels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US industrial production grew at an annual rate of 7.5 per cent in real
terms in the fourth quarter of last year, a further sign of the accelerating
pace of economic recovery, figures from the Federal Reserve indicated
yesterday.
The news prompted a strong rise in share prices and the Dow Jones Industrial
Average finished the day 24.77 up at a new high of 3,867.2. Bond prices fell
on fears that faster growth would bring forward the timing of an interest
rate rise.
As the Clinton administration puts the final touches to this year's budget,
due early next month, senior officials are increasingly confident about the
economic outlook.
In an address in New York yesterday, Mr Robert Rubin, chairman of the White
House National Economic Council, forecast a robust, sustained recovery.
He said there was 'very little probability of inflation reigniting' and
predicted 3 per cent growth this year. Mr Rubin said economic conditions
would also be favourable in 1995 and 1996 because, by then, the US would be
boosted by economic recovery in Japan and Europe.
In an apparent preview of the budget, Mr Rubin also predicted the US would
make more rapid progress than expected in reducing the federal budget
deficit.
The deficit would fall to 'substantially under 2 per cent of GDP' over five
years, he said. Last year's budget projected a deficit of 3.1 per cent in
1998.
The Fed report showed production up 0.7 per cent in December after strong
gains in preceding months.
Although led by a surge in car production, output strength appears broadly
based, with nearly every industrial sector registering healthy gains.
Excluding cars, production was up 0.5 per cent last month, the same rise as
in November.
The rate of industrial capacity utilisation rose to 83.5 per cent, above its
long-term average of 81.9 per cent but still below the 84.8 per cent
registered at the peak of the 1980s boom.
The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index was reported to have
risen sharply in early January to 95.8 against 88.2 in December.

FT  15 JAN 94 / Small company share market planned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A group of venture capitalists, merchant banks and stockbrokers intends to
set up a new exchange for trading the shares of small, entrepreneurial
companies to compete with the London Stock Exchange's official list.
The move comes after the stock exchange apparently rejected a suggestion
from the City Group for Smaller Companies (Cisco) that it operate the new
market itself.
According to Cisco, the Enterprise Market could attract capital from large
and private investors previously inactive in that sector.
Cisco forecasts that the new market could have 200 listed companies two
years after inception. It hopes to attract at least five market makers and
20 to 30 stockbrokers specialising in small company shares.
Cisco's founders include stockbrokers Singer &amp; Friedlander and Beeson
Gregory, venture capitalists Apax Partners and accountants KPMG Peat
Marwick.
Over the next 10 weeks Cisco plans to conduct a tender process to find a
commercial operator for the computer network and related services. Possible
operators are Nasdaq of the US, Reuters and British Telecom. Initial costs
are estimated at Pounds 5m and finance will come from a mix of venture
capital, institutional investment and bank loans.
Mr Richard Balarkas, chief executive of Cisco, said the concept of a new
market had also been endorsed by the European Venture Capital Association
whose members - managers of venture capital portfolios - would be prepared
to list the shares of their own investments.
In April last year the stock exchange appointed a working party after
announcing it would close its Unlisted Securities Market for small company
shares and attempt to find a successor.
The exchange's board considered a report in December from the working party
that recommended the establishment of the Enterprise Market. However, the
board decided that further investigations were needed and commissioned
research from Mori to be completed by April.
Cisco believes that small companies get short shrift from the stock exchange
whose members derive most profits from making markets in the shares of the
largest companies.
The stock exchange said it planned to go ahead with its market research.

FT  15 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Video games
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Dixons' executives must be slightly bemused by the Office of Fair Trading's
decision to refer the video games market to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission. Last week the company issued a profits warning because games
discounting is rife and sales are poor. But while UK retailers may not now
be making money hand over fist in games hardware, software is still a nice
little earner. Since marginal production costs for software are low, there
is also a case for the manufacturers to answer over differential pricing
between the UK and the US. The restrictions on software licensing are also a
worrying sign, as is the fact that the Federal Trade Commission fined
Nintendo for price fixing in the US three years ago.
Differential pricing, however, occurs in areas as diverse as a trip to a
Disney theme park or the purchase of a CD. Multinational manufacturers'
margins are not normally broken down by regional market, so genuine returns
are difficult to assess. If companies are using US demand to fill their
factories and Europe to generate profit, it will be hard to prove and harder
still to change.
