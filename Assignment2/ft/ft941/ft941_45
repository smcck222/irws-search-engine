FT  12 JAN 94 / The Finance Bill: Setback predicted for many funds -
Unapproved pensions

The finance bill appears to have dealt a blow to all unapproved pension
schemes known as Furbs (funded unapproved retirement benefit schemes), which
seek to invest funds tax-efficiently, either offshore or in tax exempt
assets, according to Mr John Mackay, senior tax partner of accountants Ernst
&amp; Young.
The November Budget aimed to tax benefit received from a Furbs not
previously taxed in the UK.
The Inland Revenue said it would stop such schemes where income and capital
gains were wholly or partly taxed - providing employees with a larger
tax-free lump sum on retirement.

FT  12 JAN 94 / The Finance Bill: Labour warns it will give bill rough
passage - Commons Battle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Labour party warned yesterday that its current refusal to co-operate
with Tory whips over the government's legislative programme would give the
finance bill a difficult passage through the House of Commons.
In previous years Labour and Tory whips have agreed to argue over a limited
number of clauses to get the legislation through.
This time the Labour party has withdrawn co-operation with the government on
parliamentary matters, in protest at the speed with which the statutory sick
pay bill was pushed through all its Commons stages last month.
Ms Harriet Harman, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said that
government ministers would acquire 'a serious headache' trying to implement
the bill, which at 417 pages will be the largest of this session.
'We are seeking to create difficulties for this bill,' she said. The main
measures Labour plans to oppose are the insurance premium tax, the air
passenger tax, the freezing of personal allowances and the reduction in the
married couples' allowance.
She also claimed that the introduction of a unified Budget in November meant
that the timetable for the finance bill was to the Conservatives'
disadvantage.
Under the old system the finance bill was debated after the implementation
of many of the Budget's measures. But Ms Harman claimed that, on this
occasion, Tory MPs would be asked to vote for tax-raising measures yet to
take effect. 'This will put more pressure on Tory MPs who could rebel,' she
said.
Tory ministers were confident, however, that Labour's policy would pose no
threat to the bill.
Many of the bill's provisions are due to take effect at the start of April
but some were enacted by a resolution at the end of the budget debate last
month.

FT  12 JAN 94 / The Finance Bill: Income tax administration faces its
biggest change for decades - The finance bill, published yesterday, is
designed to turn the provisions of Kenneth Clarke's first Budget into law.
An all-party standing committee of MPs, meeting through February and March,
will be responsible for most of the detailed deliberation on its 241
clauses. The bill needs to receive the royal assent by May 5
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
This year's finance bill is a record breaker.
Its 241 clauses and 23 schedules cover 417 pages, making it the longest
ever. It will pave the way for a system of self-assessment of personal taxes
that is the most far-reaching change to the administration of Britain's
income tax system since the introduction of pay-as-you-earn after the second
world war.
The bill to turn the November 30 Budget into law also reflects the most
extensive advance consultation with experts by the government of any UK
Budget.
The bill contains no new departures from the policies announced on Budget
day. However, it includes a mass of detail that was not in Mr Kenneth
Clarke's speech or the Budget announcements from the Treasury, Inland
Revenue, Customs and Excise and other government departments.
Two new taxes, the air passenger duty and the insurance premium tax, account
respectively for 15 and 24 clauses of the bill. The insurance tax alone
covers 17 1/2 pages.
The chapter covering changes to income tax, corporation tax and capital
gains tax takes up 64 clauses and covers 70 pages.
The parts of the bill introducing self-assessment and simplifying the income
tax system are covered in two chapters that run to 40 clauses and 40 pages
altogether. The various tax schedules take up 213 pages, or more than half
the bill.
The government consulted experts about 170 clauses of the bill, with
discussions on all but 40 clauses being held before Budget day.
It released 96 clauses for discussion in draft form before the Budget and
six clauses afterwards.
But this detailed discussion on technical issues between the government and
experts did not prevent the bill from running into criticism yesterday.
Ernst &amp; Young, the business advisory company, condemned the bill as
'nonsense'.
Mr Andrew Jones, Ernst &amp; Young's national head of tax, said the Inland
Revenue was trying too hard to legislate for every possible eventuality,
however remote. Mr Jones pointed out that the legislation on international
headquarter companies and foreign income dividends, which is meant to make
life easier for companies and attract foreign investment, 'runs to more than
28 pages of fine print'.
'I seriously doubt whether any member of parliament, however dedicated, can
be expected to scrutinise this bill with the care it deserves,' he said.
Mr Andrew Dilnot, director of the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies,
said the bill represented a lost opportunity.
Instead of producing a completed finance bill that would be debated on
narrow party political lines, the government should produce a draft Budget
which would trigger a widespread debate on policy and technical taxation
issues, he said.
The exact timing of the bill's passage through parliament has still to be
fixed by the business managers of the House of Commons.
However, its second reading is expected around January 24. It is likely to
be considered by the committee of the whole house at the end of the month
before being considered by a standing committee from February 7, 8 or 9.
The committee stage is due to be completed before the Easter recess so that
the bill can be considered by the Commons after the holiday.
It must receive royal assent by May 5.

FT  12 JAN 94 / The Finance Bill: 10m people to file own returns -
Self-assessment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Inland Revenue yesterday published details of the new system of
self-assessment of personal taxation which will affect about 10m people.
The main changes - promised by Mr Kenneth Clarke in the last Budget - will
allow people to calculate their own tax liability and to pay it with no
further need for communication with the Revenue.
The self-employed from 1996 will be taxed on current year profits rather
than those made in the preceding year as is the case at the moment.
The Revenue says these changes will significantly simplify the
administration of tax returns. All unincorporated businesses and anyone who
pays more than simple PAYE will be affected by the changes.
Taxpayers will also have to keep records in order to make returns. Trading
records will have to be kept until the fifth anniversary of the filing date
of the return. Others will have to be kept until the first anniversary of
the filing date.
There will be transitional rules for businesses running on April 5 this
year. Companies that set up after that date will immediately pay taxes on
same-year profits.
Individuals and trustees will likewise have to send tax returns to the
Revenue by January 31 after the tax year or, if later, three months after
the return is issued.
If taxpayers choose not to work out their own tax bills they can send a
completed tax return to the Revenue by the September 30 following the end of
the tax year.
Changes concerning income and capital gains tax will take effect from
1996-97 while those affecting corporation tax will apply to accounting
periods ending not earlier than April 1, 1996.
The provisions published yesterday as part of the finance bill will be
followed by a second tranche of legislation in the 1995 finance bill.

FT  12 JAN 94 / The Finance Bill: Government set to buck European norm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's finance bill contained few surprises for insurers but did little
to clarify how the controversial new premium tax will be implemented in
practice.
Insurers and brokers have until the end of the month to make their
representations. Analysts do not expect full details to emerge until
regulations are published later this year.
The indications are, though, that the government will press ahead with its
plan to charge the new tax on premiums net of insurance brokerage, rather
than on the gross premiums.
This has caused some consternation in the insurance industry, partially
because it could put insurers selling directly to the public - rather than
through an intermediary such as an agent or broker - at a competitive
disadvantage.
Insurers selling direct - through a combination of mass media advertising
and telephone sales - have made strong inroads into the motor and
increasingly the home-insurance market in recent years, and now account for
more than 15 per cent of the personal market.
'We are keen to see that the competitive balance between different
distribution channels is not altered,' said Mr Tony Baker, head of public
relations at the Association of British Insurers. Mr Baker also pointed to
possible administrative difficulties. He said, however, that the bill's
wording was sufficiently flexible 'to enable many of the areas of contention
to be dealt with. The industry's main concerns are the practicality and cost
of dealing with the tax.'
Insurance brokers have still to define their position in relation to the new
tax, said Mr David Hough of the British Insurance and Investment Brokers'
Association. In spite of apparent concern in some quarters that charging the
tax on a net basis could make insurance brokerage commissions more
transparent, Mr Hough said that charging the tax on a gross basis would
increase costs for consumers.
He said, however, 'There are difficulties and greater costs in applying it
on a net basis and most European countries levy the tax on a gross basis.'

FT  12 JAN 94 / The Finance Bill: Private health market 'may suffer' -
Insurance Premium Tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER and BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The premium tax introduced by the Finance Bill could hinder the growth of
the private health and creditor insurance market at a time when these
sectors are being asked to fill gaps developing in the welfare state,
insurers said yesterday.
Neither line of insurance is among those specifically excluded from the tax,
which will be imposed on most general insurance from next October.
Mr Tony Baker, head of public relations at the Association of British
Insurers, said insurers may press for an amendment to the bill. 'We don't
think health and creditor insurance should be taxable. This will send the
wrong signals to the public.
Mr Julian Ross, product development manager with Prime Health, a specialist
medical insurer, said: 'If the whole philosophy and policy of this
government is to make people more self-reliant, it seems rather stupid to
penalise them for taking out private medical insurance. They are effectively
being double-taxed.' Medical insurers are also searching for a way around
the tax, using the distinction between long-term insurance, such as life
cover, which is exempt from the tax, and general short-term insurance, which
is not.
Bupa, the largest supplier of private medical insurance, has applied to the
Department for Trade and Industry for a licence to write long-term business,
for a subsidiary it is planning to set up this spring. Bupa is considering
using it to write some private medical cover as long-term business, avoiding
the tax.
Norwich Union and PPP, which can already write long-term business in
addition to conventional private medical insurance, are also considering
this option. However, Mr Tim Baker, product development manager with Norwich
Union Healthcare, said there were many complications involved in writing PMI
on a long-term basis. At present, PMI premiums are reviewed once or twice a
year. Insurers have been able to increase premiums steeply to cope with
rising costs and claim levels in the past few years, but if policies were
arranged over longer terms, underwriters would have to be careful to price
them correctly from the start.
There may also be discrepancies in other sectors. Prime Health also offers
long-term care insurance to cover nursing for the elderly, written on an
annually renewable basis, while all its competitors offer cover on a
long-term basis. Unless it obtains an exemption, Prime Health's policies
will be at a competitive disadvantage, as it has no long-term side to which
to switch the business.
Large corporate medical schemes may avoid most of the tax's impact by
unbundling their cover into its constituent parts. Insurance - in the form
of stop-loss cover - accounts for only a tiny proportion of their total
premiums, while the rest is actual hospital costs, administration and so on.
Lines of insurance excluded from the tax include reinsurance, large scale
marine and aviation, and exports.

FT  12 JAN 94 / The Finance Bill: Commissioners gain new power -
Confidentiality
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tax commissioners are to be given the power to request information from the
Inland Revenue on a taxpayer's liability to tax to help them in deciding tax
appeals.
The change outlined in the Finance Bill follows similar provision in the
1992 Finance (No 2) Act enabling the Lord Chancellor, Lord Mackay, to make
regulations giving General and Special tax commissioners powers to request
information from taxpayers about their tax affairs.
The move follows concern expressed by the Council on Tribunals, the
government's tribunals watchdog, about the lack of formal procedural rules
for tax appeals.
In 1991 the Council produced a set of model rules, which prompted the Lord
Chancellor's Department and the Inland Revenue to issue a joint consultation
document: Procedural Rules for General and Special Commissioners.
The consultation exercise exposed the need for commissioners to have tougher
powers to request information from both sides to an appeal.
Clause 239 of the bill provides powers for the Lord Chancellor with consent
to make regulations allowing the commissioners to require any party to an
appeal, including the Inland Revenue, to provide information relevant to the
determination of a taxpayer's liability.
The Lord Chancellor is expected to lay the regulations before Parliament
soon.
In the 1992/1993 tax year the general commissioners dealt with 376,695 tax
appeals and the special commissioners heard 45 cases.

FT  12 JAN 94 / The Finance Bill: Capital gains boost for trusts -
Collective Funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Investors in gilts through a unit trust will be able to use indexation to
mitigate their capital gains, according to a clause in the finance bill.
Investors in assets exempt from capital gains tax, such as UK government
bonds, are liable to pay the tax when these assets are held in a collective
fund such as a unit trust or offshore fund.
Under clause 89 of the bill, investors in collective funds and building
society shares will be able to offset part of their tax liability through an
indexation allowance based on movements in the retail price index.
Investors will only be able to use this allowance to reduce tax liabilities
on capital gains. In the November Budget the chancellor abolished the use of
indexation to create or increase losses for tax relief.
Mr Simon Smith, taxation adviser at the Association of Unit Trusts and
Investment Funds, welcomed the change. 'We have been lobbying for it for a
long time so it is nice to see it there,' he said.
The bill also removed an anomaly in the treatment of options for capital
gains tax payers, making it no longer disadvantageous to exercise a put
option rather than sell it.
The bill confirms the introduction of the airport departure tax announced in
the November Budget. From October 1 air passengers from the UK will be
charged Pounds 5 for flights to British and European Union destinations and
Pounds 10 for trips elsewhere. Airlines will be responsible for collecting
the duty. Children under two, passengers on aircraft with fewer than 20
seats and those making return journeys in the UK will be exempted.

FT  12 JAN 94 / The Finance Bill: Accountants open attack - Inland Revenue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An accountants' body yesterday criticised a clause in the finance bill
giving new powers to the Inland Revenue to demand access to accountants'
documents as 'an unacceptable erosion of taxpayers' rights'.
The bill will give the Inland Revenue the right to examine documents held by
tax accountants who it suspects of falsifying their clients' tax affairs.
Previously, the Inland Revenue has only been able to demand documents from
tax accountants if they had been found guilty of a tax-related offence.
Mr Derek Allen, director of tax at the Institute of Chartered Accountants in
Scotland, said the clause was an important change in the balance between the
power of the Inland Revenue and the rights of the taxpayers. 'In the absence
of the Revenue giving any justification of this change, the proposal is
unacceptable,' he said.
He said that a client seeking advice from a tax accountant could no longer
be sure that his affairs would be covered by professional privilege.
Suspicion that an accountant had falsified one client's affairs would give
the right to examine all his clients' documents.
The government said that the new clause was intended to remedy a weakness in
the Revenue's power to obtain accountants' documents. It was 'maintaining
the balance between taxpayers' rights and revenue powers in this sensitive
area', it said.
The Revenue said the rules would not be open to abuse as it would need
'reasonable grounds' and the consent of a special commissioner.
Additional powers were needed as accountants had become less co-operative
after a spate of legal cases at the end of the 1980s in which clients had
sued their accountants for disclosing information to the Revenue.
Two other changes to the Revenue's powers to obtain information were
welcomed by accountants. Clause 240 restricts a commissioner's right to hear
applications for information and appeals involving the same information. It
also requires tax inspectors to give reasons underlying their application
for information.

FT  12 JAN 94 / The Finance Bill: Measures announced to prevent extra
liabilities - British Rail Privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Measures to ensure that the privatisation of British Rail does not trigger
extra liability for tax have been announced in the finance bill published
yesterday.
The aim is ensure that the reorganisation of the railways prompted by the
Railways Act of last November is broadly tax neutral, the Inland Revenue
said.
The bill proposes measures in three areas:
Companies which emerge from the break-up of British Rail will be able to
inherit BR's entitlement to capital allowances and other tax reliefs. BR is
being broken up into separate organisations which will own its track and
signalling, three leasing companies which will own the rolling stock and a
larger number of operating companies which are expected to bid for
franchises to operate trains.
Provisions in the Railways Act which would have otherwise been treated as
'schemes and arrangements', and attracted anti-avoidance legislation, will
be exempted. Such arrangements allow companies to reduce chargeable gains or
increase allowable losses or group relief to avoid tax.
This will exempt provisions from section 30 of the Taxation of Chargeable
Gains Act 1992, from section 410 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act
(ICTA) 1988 and option arrangements from paragraph 5B of Schedule 8 of ICTA
1988.
Vouchers permitting free or cheap travel for about 5,000 BR staff will
continue to be exempted from tax for employees earning less than Pounds
8,500 and who continue to work in the rail industry.

FT  12 JAN 94 / Unions divided on pay protest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Public-service union leaders are divided over whether to back the call for a
day of action on April 11 as a protest against the government's three-year
freezing of the public sector pay bill.
Clear differences of opinion over the wisdom of going ahead with a
co-ordinated attempt to bring 5.8m workers out on strike for 24 hours
surfaced yesterday at a TUC meeting of unions representing at least 5m
public service workers. Unions are taking soundings among their members to
find out how much support they could expect for a one-day disruption.
A final decision over the planned day of action will not be taken until
February 1 when leaders of all public sector unions, including those in
nationalised industries, are due to meet.
If the unions agree to call a strike or other disruption on April 11 they
are legally obliged to organise postal ballots of their members. This will
be costly and some union leaders fear it might expose a lack of enthusiasm
among public-sector workers.
One senior union official said: 'The trouble is that the media would focus
just on how many came out on strike even if they backed action in a ballot
and anything less than a massive turnout would be seen as a defeat for us.'
The TUC is to demand a meeting with Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, to
seek clarification on how flexible the government's public-sector pay policy
will be.
The organisation estimates that a pay freeze this year would mean a 6 per
cent pay cut in real terms for public-sector workers, although it is
possible that efficiency savings could raise as much as 2 per cent in wage
increases. Union leaders are also keen to secure assurances from Mr Clarke
that public-sector jobs will not be lost as a result of the government's
tough pay policy.
The public-sector unions intend to campaign vigorously to mobilise public
opinion against the government on the wages issue. But officials have no
wish to organise any aggressive offensive that alienates people by
disrupting services as happened in the 'winter of discontent' of 1978-79.

FT  12 JAN 94 / Why MPs used to get away with it: Ivor Owen recalls the
1950s when papers were required to be 'respectable'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Conventions, and particularly the ways newspapers maximise their sales, have
changed more since the 1950s than the behaviour of politicians.
Advocates of the Conservative party's 'back to basics' campaign have drawn
heavily on nostalgia for this post-war 'golden age'.
In those days MPs - and ministers - did engage in extra-marital affairs.
They may have been more discreet, but in many cases their activities were
known to political journalists.
They were not exposed in print because the social climate required popular
newspapers to be 'respectable' as well as entertaining.
Another factor was that the prominent newspaper proprietors of that time
(only the Communist Daily Worker was able to boast 'Not a lord on the
board') judged it more important to retain personal contacts with leading
politicians than to publicise their sexual mores.
The second Viscount Rothermere was branded the 'pornographer royal' when his
ailing Sunday Dispatch published what would now be regarded as an innocuous
serialisation of the novel Forever Amber.
Politicians whose marriages broke down sought to avoid the stigma of being
named the 'guilty party' in divorce proceedings, and Tory MPs were expected
to inform party whips well in advance of the court hearing.
Minimising embarrassment to the party and government was the prime
objective, and those involved in 'messy cases' were left in no doubt that
they should resign as soon as it became politically opportune to do so.
Some of the older Tory grandees still active at Westminster believe that, if
this practice had not been abandoned, many of the government's current
difficulties could have been avoided.
For example, they believe that the initial message conveyed by the whips to
the prime minister about Mr Tim Yeo, the former environment minister, should
have been that he had already decided to resign his post.
There is little doubt that under earlier regimes Tory whips would have
played no part in encouraging suggestions that avoiding resignation was a
feasible option.
Ministers in successive administrations have not found it easy to satisfy
calls to lead by example in any area of social policy.
Labour and Tory ministers urging restraint in wage claims have been
discomfited by the realisation that they resembled the fat man telling the
thin man to tighten his belt.
Lord Eccles secured only a marginal response in the 1950s when, as education
minister, he cited the benefits gained by his grandchildren when urging
better-off parents to send their children to the local primary school rather
than to a fee-paying establishment.
One example from the past which members of Mr Major's cabinet might do well
to bear in mind is the response by Mr Iain Macleod, then leader of the
Commons, when on returning from the US he was questioned about the Profumo
affair.
He said: 'Jack Profumo was, and is, my friend.'

FT  12 JAN 94 / Home office telecoms staff opt to strike on Monday
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Home Office staff employed in its telecommunications installation and
maintenance division have voted to strike for one day next Monday and to
withdraw 24 hour on-call cover indefinitely from 18 January.
The staff - members of the NUCPS civil service union - voted by 83 per cent
to 17 per cent to back industrial disruption in a postal ballot with a 65
per cent turnout.
The staff are concerned at the government's refusal to provide redundancy
and severance protection when the service is privatised. The union's general
secretary, Mr John Sheldon, said: 'I find it incredible the Treasury is
willing to jeopardise such a key service. All we are asking for is fair
treatment. The government have given guarantees to staff in other privatised
departments - why are we different?'
The Home Office said the government was still discussing terms and
conditions for staff in the proposed privatisation. Any new owner would have
to meet legal obligations to existing staff.
The union said staff feared a repetition of a situation last year where the
Astra company, which acquired Skillcentres, collapsed into receivership with
hundreds of staff being made redundant on minimum terms rather than those
covering the civil service.

FT  12 JAN 94 / Free vote on capital punishment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is to allow MPs a free vote on capital punishment as part of
its drive against crime, it was announced last night.
Mr David Maclean, home office minister of state, said the vote would be the
only opportunity for MPs to express a view on hanging in the current
parliament, which must end by 1997.
The vote will form part of the debate on the criminal justice bill, which
the government claims will give the UK the most comprehensive framework
possible for fighting crime.
Mr Maclean also confirmed that MPs will be given a free vote on proposals to
reduce the age of consent for homosexuals from 21.
The last Commons vote on capital punishment was in December 1990, when a
Conservative backbench attempt to impose the death penalty for the murder of
a police officer was rejected by 350 votes to 215. Conservative supporters
of the death penalty believe capital punishment is unlikely to be
reinstated.
Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, said the bill - the cornerstone of
the troubled 'back to basics' programme - would implement 18 of the 27
law-and-order initiatives launched at last year's Tory party conference.
Mr Howard said these initiatives rested on 'basic, commonsense principles'
which would make life 'safer for the law-abiding and more difficult for the
criminal'.
The bill was given an unopposed second reading after MPs rejected by 319
votes to 275 a Labour amendment calling for stronger crime prevention
measures and an independent review authority to monitor miscarriages of
justice.
Mr Tony Blair, shadow home secretary, said the bill's purpose was to provide
balance and strategy to a government that lacked both.
'What people want after 14 years is not another dose of Tory rhetoric but
effective actions that work,' he said.
Mr Blair appeared to surprise Mr Howard by revealing that Labour would
abstain in the second-reading vote if its own amendment was rejected.
Mr Howard argued that Labour's stance showed it could not make up its mind
on the wide range of proposals covered by the bill. When Mr Blair 'sits on
his hands tonight, the British public will see that his rhetoric is just hot
air,' the home secretary said.
Mr Howard attempted to defuse criticism of the failure to include moves to
set up an independent review authority by pledging 'shortly' to publish a
consultation paper on the subject.
The home secretary emphasised that he accepted a recent Royal Commission
recommendation that such a body be established and was 'determined' to
ensure that effective machinery was set up.
But he said a number of issues, including the relationship between the new
authority and both ministers and the Court of Appeal, had still to be
resolved. These matters were being taken forward urgently.

FT  12 JAN 94 / Poll puts Labour at 50% and Conservatives at 26%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour has the support of half of the electorate for the first time in
nearly four years, says a poll carried out by ICM for today's Guardian.
The poll puts Labour support at 50 per cent, up from 47 per cent last month.
The Liberal Democrats are down 3 percentage points to 20 per cent.
Conservative support is steady on 26 per cent.
The poll suggests that government support was unaffected by the resignation
of Mr Tim Yeo as environment minister after disclosures about an
extramarital affair.
However, the research was carried out before the resignation of the Earl of
Caithness as transport minister following the death of his wife.
The poll gives Labour its highest share since April 1990, at the height of
the controversy over the council tax.
The 1990 poll convinced Labour leaders that the party was likely to win the
1992 general election - but the lead had gone by then.
Labour, with 25 per cent, was regarded as having the best economic policies.
The Tories scored 20 per cent and the Liberal Democrats 8 per cent.
ICM interviewed 1,460 adults in 103 constituencies last Friday and Saturday.

FT  12 JAN 94 / Backbenchers wonder who will be next: 'Back to basics'
debacle is 'a little flurry', says PM - Criminal justice bill is outlined
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The prime minister may have dismissed the controversy over his 'back to
basics' policy as 'a little flurry', but in the Commons tea rooms and bars
backbenchers could talk of little else.
As MPs returned to Westminster after the Christmas recess, many were
wondering who was going to be the next victim of the scandals that have
slammed the brakes on the careers of Mr Tim Yeo, the former environment
minister and Mr Alan Duncan, the former parliamentary private secretary to
health minister Dr Brian Mawhinney.
A throughly fed-up parliamentary private secretary said it was now
impossible for MPs to be seen out alone with anyone apart from their wives.
'It's now got to the stage that there could be rumours about my sexuality if
I dine out with a male friend. That is not what 'back to basics' was meant
to be about,' he said angrily.
In the fraught atmosphere, a Scottish Conservative backbencher believed he
may have narrowly escaped becoming the lastest casualty when he was
photographed by a journalist leaving a lunchtime function with a woman half
his age. She was his research assistant.
A senior Tory backbencher, a close friend of the MP, said the story
illustrated how 'back to basics' was in danger of being engulfed in personal
scandals. 'If the media go to that length to catch MPs out, then of course
they will find politicians who have erred and we will all look ridiculous.'
Tory MPs' views mosly fall into three categories:
The moralising tendency. This was best illustrated by Mr David Shaw, the
rightwing MP for Dover, who said he was not in favour of witch hunts but
warned ministers to examine their consciences before speaking out on 'back
to basics'.
Mr Shaw, who has attended Republican conventions in the US where the moral
majority has held sway for more than a decade, believes MPs cannot divorce
morality from politics.
'Many businessmen,' he said, 'would not employ people of low moral
standards, employees who womanise or who drink too much. Why should
politicians be any different?'
A former trade minister, Mr Edward Leigh, appeared to go further in urging
the government to 'attack the permissive society funded by the state'. He
said there had to be a moral dimension and ministers should 'stick with it'
in spite of the uproar over errant MPs' behaviour. The frightened tendency.
A nervous backbencher, whose eyes kept darting across the members' lobby as
MPs left the chamber following prime ministers questions, urged the
government to 'put a lid on this awful pandora's box'.
He said the moralising of some cabinet members had given the tabloids the
justification they were looking for to report on private lives. 'Where will
it stop?' he asked, concerned that reporters are asking too many
embarrassing personal questions.
The 'prime minister is to blame' tendency. 'The policy is fine' said one
querulous minister, 'the prime minister's handling of it is not.' He thought
that Mr Major should not have let cabinet members interpret the policy in
different ways.
Another parliamentary private secretary gave a sigh when asked what had gone
wrong. 'If only John Major had the bottle to sack Tim Yeo when it was known
he had fathered a child outside marriage we may not have got into this
terrible mess.'
Some MPs believe the government will survive the crisis as long as there are
no more revelations. Others predict the scandal will continue to run unless
the policy is redefined.
It was left to Mr Leigh to sum up the mood of the pessimists when he
predicted the government would get itself together only to stumble into
another crisis.

FT  12 JAN 94 / Power price cuts of up to 15% offered to companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Companies are being offered cuts of up to 15 per cent in the price of
electricity as power suppliers prepare for the introduction of more
competition in the market for medium-sized to large consumers from April.
The average cut, however, will be considerably less. Inenco, the energy
consultancy, said most offers would lead to power costs falling by 4 per
cent to 8 per cent.
Some companies said they had been offered no reductions. This is partly
because electricity companies are tending to demand more frequent payment of
bills by companies which want to sign tailor-made contracts rather than
remain on standard tariffs.
Consultants are advising clients against signing contracts hastily. Mr
Andrew Johns, director of the consultancy National Utility Services, said:
'Many regional electricity companies will not offer prices outside the areas
where they supply until nearer April. Even then they may review and revise.'
The April changes represent the second liberalisation of the electricity
market. About 5,000 sites which use more than 1MW of electricity have been
able to buy power from a range of suppliers since the industry's
privatisation three years ago.
Less intensive consumers have been required to buy power from their local
regional electricity company. However, from April 1 the threshold of the
competitive market will fall to 100 kilowatts, taking in another 45,000
consumers ranging from medium-sized businesses, including supermarkets, to
schools and hospitals.
The largest reductions on current tariffs are being offered to sites that
are one of a series owned by large companies, and to those that require
substantial amounts of electricity outside periods of peak demand.
Mr Ken Green, power and water purchaser for Imperial Chemical Industries,
said yesterday that at the 15 or so company sites which would become
eligible to choose their electricity supplier from April, the largest
reduction was about 15 per cent.
That applied to only one or two sites, however. Some were being offered
virtually no price advantage and the average was between 4 per cent and 5
per cent.
Mr John Hardy, managing director of Fowler &amp; Holden, a small engineering
company in Grimsby, said he had rejected offers from two electricity
suppliers which had required payment of bills every 10 to 12 days rather
than monthly.
Neither offer would have cut the company's electricity costs, he said.
Mr Brian Acott, of Inenco, said most regional companies were demanding
settlement periods of 10 days. Many customers had already signed deals which
they might regret when further offers became available from other companies,
he said.
Offer, the electricity industry regulator, has criticised electricity
companies over attempts to tie existing customers to long-term deals in the
approach to April and has instructed them to offer contract escape clauses
in some cases.
Mr Acott said some power companies were making withdrawal from contracts
diffi-cult by charging significant administration costs as a penalty.

Limiting the latest changes to the government's frontbench team in the House
of Lords, Mr Major promoted Lord Strathclyde to minister of state at the
Department of Trade and Industry. Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish was given the
role of parliamentary undersecretary for transport, taking the portfolio

FT  12 JAN 94 / Ashdown forms commission to develop economic policy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Paddy Ashdown, leader of the Liberal Democrat party, has formed a
commission to draw up policies aimed at boosting the economy while at the
same time tackling unemployment.
Mr Ashdown said he is keen to improve the nation's competitiveness but also
enhance 'social cohesion'.
The Commission on Wealth Creation and Social Cohesion will look at how to
generate wealth yet keep unemployment low and protect the environment.
The commission, chaired by Liberal Democrat academic Lord Dahrendorf, warden
of St Antony's College, Oxford, will also consider issues such as taxation
and the operation of banks.
It will gather evidence from business leaders, trade unions, economic
analysts and professionals from education and social services. The
commission will produce a report with about six proposals in the autumn.
Mr Ashdown said: 'There is a desperate need for an authoritative,
comprehensive and radical vision of Britain's economic future.
'The commission's role is to establish impartially the needs and changes
which we must address as a nation.'
Proposals made by the commission would 'inform but not dictate' Liberal
Democrat policies, he said.

FT  12 JAN 94 / Rescue opens for standards service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An effort by businesses to amend legislation on local-government
reorganisation in order to counter costly fragmentation of the trading
standards service will begin next week.
Lord Elton, a Conservative peer, is to table an amendment to the bill for
Wales - which would create 21 unitary authorities in place of eight counties
 -to provide three trading standards authorities for the principality.
Trading standards have hitherto been a county council responsibility in both
England and Wales.
Lord Elton's amendment has all-party support. Similar plans are likely to be
recommended by the Local Government Commission.
Mr Paul Allen, chairman of the Institute of Trading Standards, said that
spreading the service over 21 authorities in Wales would fragment it to the
extent that 'it will not be capable of dealing with national and
international cases'.
The institute claims that the legislation, as it stands, will 'substantially
increase the burdens on business, reduce the services' effectiveness, and
substantially increase costs'. Groups backing the institute's view include
the Confederation of British Industry and the British Retail Consortium.
The institute cites a survey by Birmingham University's Institute of Local
Government Studies which says: that 'The minimum size of authority for
effective administration of the service is 750,000 population.'
Mr Allen points out that the government plans to create only three police
authorities for Wales.

FT  12 JAN 94 / BBC's cost-cut drive attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BBC unions yesterday attacked plans to end comprehensive collective
bargaining across the corporation as part of a drive to save Pounds 50m this
year.
The package outlined to unions and staff yesterday includes:
Personal performance reviews which will influence pay levels.
An end to near-automatic incremental pay rises for everyone who joins the
BBC from April.
Freedom for individual directorates to negotiate their own conditions in
areas such as payment for unpredictable working patterns.
The BBC's director of personnel, Ms Margaret Salmon, promised yesterday that
BBC pay would remain competitive and that collective bargaining would
continue on basic pay and a raft of 'core' conditions such as the length of
the working week, annual leave, sickness and pension provisions.
Mr Tony Lennon, president of Bectu, the main technical broadcasting union
said yesterday: 'Their line of least resistance is to cut the wages of the
people who do the work.' He warned that the unions may take industrial
action.
Mr Lennon said that the BBC was being forced to make cuts to balance the
books of the business units created by Producer Choice - the internal market
system under which producers can buy in services from the outside market.
Producer Choice, Mr Lennon said yesterday, had created some of the cost
problems that the BBC was now trying to tackle. For example, it meant more
peaks and troughs in the flow of work, thereby increasing costs by not using
staff evenly. Mr Rod Lynch, managing director of resources, engineering and
services, the largest directorate with 11,000 out of the BBC's 21,000 staff,
said yesterday that existing terms and conditions appeared to be based on
old film-making traditions.
'That is singularly inappropriate, not only for 1994 but the competitive
environment that the BBC finds itself in,' he said.
The number of grades is to be reduced from 20 to 11 and consistently high
performers may receive more than the standard increase and move more rapidly
through grades.

FT  12 JAN 94 / Number of cable phone subscribers trebles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The number of cable telephone subscribers almost trebled last year, and
heavy investment in new construction is likely to see subscriber numbers
more than double in 1994.
Cable exchange line connections rose last year from 109,133 to 317,000.
Residential customers accounted for most of the growth, with the number of
business lines rising from 16,000 to about 35,000.
The Cable Television Association predicts that total exchange line
connections will rise to more than 700,000 this year.
It expects growth again to be led by the residential sector, where cable
companies are competing with British Telecommunications mainly on price.
Growth is faster than predicted when the BT/Mercury duopoly was abolished in
1991, allowing cable companies - mostly north American telecommunications
operators - to build combined television and telephone networks in urban
areas. Virtually all growth has been concentrated in the past 18 months; in
July 1992 there were only 48,000 cable telephone subscribers.
In some areas under construction, take-up of cable telephony is already
running at around 30 per cent, with telephony more popular than cable
television.
The cable companies market the two together, often with discounts for
customers taking both.
With more than 20m lines, BT's dominance is not immediately threatened. But
with Mercury also marketing its long-distance network to residents for the
first time, cable operators are set to make a significant dent in BT's
armoury.
The cable companies have invested about Pounds 1.7bn in their new networks,
and the investment will increase to more than Pounds 5bn over the next four
years.
Mr Alan Bates, managing director of Jones Cable, a US operator with a share
in nine UK franchises, forecast 'five or six' large equity financing deals
within the next few months, each of which would raise more than Pounds 100m
for future expansion. Most of the top 10 UK cable operators would be
involved, he said.
Jones led the way last year with a Pounds 152m equity-and-debt deal to fund
construction in Leeds. Investors included NatWest Ventures and Cable &amp;
Wireless, which owns Mercury.
Combined cable television and telephone networks are under construction in
62 franchises, covering a total of 15m homes. BT has only one franchise, for
Westminster, where it is constructing a cable TV network. Videotron, an
operator with six London franchises, has applied to the government for a
licence to build a telephone network in the same area.
With Colt, another US-owned company, building its own network in the City,
central London could have three rival local phone networks if Videotron
gains its licence.

legal adviser to those involved in UK public takeovers last year, it was
disclosed yesterday.
The firm advised companies or financial advisers in 13 deals worth Pounds
1.78bn according to Acquisitions Monthly magazine, which ranks law firms by
the value of the takeovers in which they acted as advisers.
Slaughters' position in the league follows its involvement as adviser to
merchant banks in a number of media deals.
The firm advised Hambros on Carlton Communications' Pounds 758m offer for
Central Independent Television. It was also involved in the Pounds 99m sale
of Thames Television to Pearson and is now involved in helping London
Weekend Television fight off Granada's Pounds 600m bid.
Herbert Smith was ranked second for its involvement in 15 deals worth Pounds
1.48bn. The firm acted for Central on the Carlton deal and for Owners Abroad
in its successful defence against the Pounds 283m hostile takeover bid from
rival operator Airtours.
Clifford Chance was placed third with six transactions worth Pounds 1.32bn.
The firm's good showing is partly to its involvement in Carlton's bid for
Central and the Pounds 242m Whitbread-Whitbread Investment deal.
Takeover activity remained depressed during 1993. The 20 most active UK law
firms acting for companies as opposed to financial advisers were involved in
91 UK public takeovers with a combined value of only Pounds 6.5bn compared
with 92 deals worth Pounds 23bn in 1992.
These figures illustrate the dramatic decline in UK public takeovers since
the mergers-and-acquisitions boom of the late 1980s. In 1989 the top 20 law
firms were involved in 263 deals worth Pounds 137bn.
Lawyers seem confident that the climate is right for an upturn in mergers
and acquisitions during 1994, but they warn that companies are much more
cautious than they used to be and that there still appears to be little
appetite among institutional investors to back significant acquisitions
strategies.

FT  12 JAN 94 / Police force to be offered protection
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Northumbria police officers are to be supplied with bullet-proof and
knife-proof vests.
The force, the first in the country to supply protective vests routinely to
any officers wishing to wear them, said yesterday it was to buy 600 vests at
a cost of Pounds 145,000, provided by the police authority.
Mr David Mellish, deputy chief constable, said it had taken two years to
find a vest offering protection against both knives and bullets. They have
been developed for the Northumbria force by Highmark, a Belfast company.
Last year a Northumbria officer, Sergeant Bill Forth, died from knife wounds
while on duty in Gateshead. Force members were seriously assaulted on 668
occasions resulting in 4,400 days' sick leave and 508 days lost through
stress.
The force has already introduced - at a cost of Pounds 218,000 - longer
truncheons, snap-on handcuffs, regular self-defence sessions and reinforced
windscreens.

FT  12 JAN 94 / Charities warned over bogus 'gifts'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Charities were yesterday warned to beware of possible fraud attempts
involving bogus donations from Nigeria.
Cafod, the Roman Catholic overseas aid agency, was notified last month that
a Nigerian donor had bequeathed Pounds 150,000 to the charity in her will.
But Cafod was told that the money could not be released until Pounds 6,000
in Nigerian taxes were paid to a Nigerian account through a British bank.
Checks established that the donation was an attempt to defraud Cafod of the
Pounds 6,000. Police are investigating whether there is any link with a
number of other frauds emanating from Nigeria that are now under
investigation.

The head of the govern-ment-funded Business Sponsorship Incentive Scheme for
the arts has been charged with obtaining Pounds 150,000 by deception, police
said yesterday.
Mr Nicholas Wood, 34, of Chiswick, west London, will appear at Southwark
Crown Court in London on January 19, Scotland Yard said. Fraud squad
officers began investigating the alleged loss of the money, thought to be
cash from the national heritage department, last summer.
The scheme is run by the charitable Association for Business Sponsorship of
the Arts to attract donations from corporate sponsors.

FT  12 JAN 94 / Waste tip opponents claim risk to aircraft
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Opponents of a planned waste dump near Cardiff Airport warned yesterday that
it would increase the risk to aircraft of bird strikes. They said that the
3m tonnes of waste a year that would be dumped on the site would attract
flocks of scavenging gulls.
Blue Circle Industries is seeking consent lasting 30 years to fill a disused
150-acre quarry at Aberthaw, South Glamorgan, with household waste.
Mr Graham Greaves, managing director of Cardiff Airport, said the proposals
presented a 'wholly unacceptable' risk of bird strike. 'The safety of air
passengers must be paramount,' he said. He alleged that the dump would
create only nine jobs, yet threaten the future of more than 5,000 people who
depended on the airport for their livelihoods.
'Even the risk of accident could affect our business and cause air companies
to withdraw their interest in our airport,' Mr Greaves said.
Blue Circle says netting measures endorsed by experts in the defence
ministry and Civil Aviation Authority will be designed to keep the birds
away.
The company first sought planning permission for the dump in March 1992, but
Mr David Hunt, who was then Welsh secretary, referred it to a public
inquiry.

FT  12 JAN 94 / Feltrim Names seek further talks on offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Leaders of the Feltrim Names, one of the largest groups of lossmakers at
Lloyd's of London, are to seek to reopen negotiations with the insurance
market's council in an attempt to improve the terms of last month's Pounds
900m settlement offer.
In a letter sent to 2,000 Names, the committee of the Feltrim Names'
Association said it could not recommend acceptance. But it stopped short of
outright rejection, encouraging hopes that Lloyd's may still be able to
settle legal actions by more than 17,000 of its Names - the individuals
whose assets have traditionally supported the market - before they reach
court.
Mr Colin Hook, chairman of the association, said: 'The offer is not good
enough to accept, but it is not so dreadful. I'm confident that it can be
improved upon.'
A total of 22,921 Names have until February 14 to vote on a proposal which
offers the great majority of them less than 40p for each pound of losses.
The Feltrim Names Association will meet next week to determine its stance.
Members are legally bound to vote on the settlement in line with their
association's position.
Another large group of loss-makers - members of Merrett syndicate 418 in
1985 - will meet today to determine their position, while a third one - the
Gooda Walker Names - assembles next week.
In its letter the Feltrim Names committee says that its members taking legal
action are being offered Pounds 236.7m, equivalent to 39.5 per cent of their
losses. The committee estimates that it could obtain between Pounds 310m and
Pounds 425m in legal action, although it says other costs such as legal fees
would have to be deducted from this amount.
In addition, the insurance funds available to meet payouts on this scale
could be reduced as a result of successful legal claims by other lossmakers.
The offer 'is sufficiently near to the lower end of the range of resources
available to meet any judgment that it must be given serious consideration,'
says the letter.
At the same time the committee is critical of the absence in the settlement
offer of any 'cap' on liabilities that might accrue to the Feltrim
syndicates in the future.
'The requirement by Lloyd's for accepting Names to give up all their legal
rights and remedies whilst leaving you with residual liabilities for
deterioration seems to us to be manifestly unfair as well as extremely
dangerous for members,' it says.

FT  12 JAN 94 / FT/Transmedia Restaurant Promotion

<TEXT>
More than 2,500 restaurants in the UK and the US are taking part in the 1994
Financial Times restaurant promotion. FT readers will be entitled to a 25
per cent saving on food and drinks consumed at lunch and dinner for a full
six months.  In addition, all readers who use their FT/Transmedia restaurant
card between January 24 and February 11 will be entered in a draw for 1,000
free lunches (or dinners) for two.
How does the FT/Transmedia restaurant card work?
When you dine at any of the participating restaurants, (lunch, dinner or
breakfast) and ask for the bill, you simply pay with your FT/Transmedia
restaurant card signing the Transmedia credit card slip for the full amount
of the bill.
This amount will then appear on your next Visa, Master Card or Delta credit
card statement together with a full credit for 25% of the amount you have
spent on food and beverages. Service and VAT are not included.
The FT/Transmedia restaurant card is free for six months.
After that period the annual membership fee is Pounds 35 and will be billed
to your credit card account unless you cancel your application with
Transmedia.
(Cardholders may cancel membership at any time for a full refund upon return
of the FT/Transmedia restaurant card).
All you have to do
Simply complete the application form and send it to FT/Transmedia Restaurant
Offer, PO Box 85 Watford, WD2 4WQ by Friday, January 21 1994.
You will then receive your personalised FT/Transmedia restaurant card
together with a list of all participating UK restaurants and a directory of
USA restaurants which accept the card.
1000 Free Meals
To enter the 1000 free meals draw, simply use your FT/Transmedia restaurant
card at any of the participating restaurants in the UK between Monday,
January 24 and Friday, February 11 1994.
You will then be entered automatically in the draw. The more times you use
your card within this period the better your chance of winning] A random
selection by computer will then be made of 1000 Transmedia Restaurant charge
slips generated in the promotional period entitling each winner to a Pounds
50 credit towards their next visit to any Transmedia restaurant (in addition
to the normal 25% saving with their card).
TERMS AND CONDITIONS The FT/Transmedia Restaurant Promotion entitles readers
to apply for an FT/Transmedia restaurant card free for the first six months.
Annual membership fees are Pounds 35 and will be billed to your credit card
account at the end of the fee-waived period.
Card holders may cancel membership at any time for a full refund on return
of the FT/Transmedia Restaurant Card. To participate in the promotion,
readers must have a Visa, Mastercard, or Delta credit card.
The FT/Transmedia restaurant card entitles holders to a 25 per cent saving
on the cost of the food and beverage portion of restaurant bills (not
including VAT, service and tip) at participating restaurants.
Group reservations for parties of seven or more must be booked through the
Transmedia office. Group reservations are subject to space available. The

from the list published in the FT.
Present your card at the end of the meal as you would any other major credit
card, sign the Transmedia slip for the full amount and keep your copy.

the 25 % saving will not be deducted at the restaurant but will appear on
your Visa, Mastercard or Delta statement.

amount of the Transmedia charge slip and will process a corresponding
transaction crediting your account for the 25 per cent discount on the food
and beverage portion of the slip.

closing date, but cannot guarantee delivery in time for the launch
promotion.
The Financial Times and Transmedia cannot be responsible for lost or stolen
cards, although Transmedia will make every effort to recover these cards.

agreed by lawyers.
The settlement ended a civil suit in the High Court in Belfast which was

after insurance companies denied liability for the incident in April 1988.
Melanie's two-year-old sister Amanda died when the parked carcaught fire.
The amount paid to Melanie, of Kesh, Fermanagh, was kept secret as a

FT  12 JAN 94 / Directors accused of Pounds 2m wine theft
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Two directors of London wine dealer Green's stole Pounds 2m of fine wines,
vintage port and champagne being stored for customers, Inner London crown
court heard yesterday.
Mr Joseph Mankowitz and Mr Raymond Burroway, who bought the 207-year-old
company in 1990, engineered a bogus sell-off of the storage part of Green's
operations to cover their tracks, said Mr Paul Dodgson, prosecuting.
Mr Mankowitz, 47, of Earls Court, west London, and Mr Burroway, 52, of
Wandsworth, south-west London, deny conspiring to steal the wine. Mr Anthony
Boylan, 58, of Park Road, Dulwich, south-east London, also denies the
charge. He is alleged to have used a false name to remove some of the wine
from storage.
Mr Dodgson claimed the Crown could prove that Mr Burroway received Pounds
80,000 from the proceeds of the sale of some of the stolen wine. There was
no direct evidence Mr Mankowitz received any money from any sales.
The trial will resume today.

FT  12 JAN 94 / Corrupt plot over Sizewell admitted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A former procurement manager with NEI Thompson Kennicott, the engineering
company taken over by Rolls-Royce in 1989, yester-day pleaded guilty at
Southwark Crown Court in London to a charge of conspiracy to corrupt, John
Mason writes.
Mr Robert Wilcox, of Colchester, Essex, admitted conspiring to receive gifts
in connection with contracts awarded to NEI by the Central Electricity
Generating Board for its Sizewell B power station.
Two other men, Mr Donald Richards, the head of Donnar Services, a marketing
company, and Mr Colin Read, another former NEI project manager, in September
admitted a similar offence of corruption. All three have been released on
bail and will be sentenced later.
Mr Wilcox's guilty plea ends a series of prosecutions by the Serious Fraud
Office over cases of corruption in tenders for big projects. The previous
investigations centred on contracts awarded by BP and Shell in their North
Sea oil operations and Transmarche Link for the Channel tunnel.

FT  12 JAN 94 / Labour raps curb on council report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The suppression of a district auditor's report into alleged electoral
manipulation by Westminster City Council is an 'appalling denial of public
information,' Labour said yesterday.
The government is braced for bad news in the report, which was to have been
published tomorrow by Mr John Magill, the district auditor, after an
investigation lasting four years.
However, Mr Magill said publication had been abandoned 'for legal reasons.'
Circulation will be restricted to 12 ratepayers who triggered the inquiry
and 30 'respondents'.
Mr Jack Straw, Labour's environment spokesman, said that the district
auditor's ruling was 'an absurd decision that cannot hold'.
Westminster council also condemned the decision.
Mr Magill is investigating claims that the Conservative controlled council
misused ratepayers' funds by selling flats in marginal wards to Conservative
supporters.
Labour says an influx of homeowners helped the Conservatives to win 45 of
the council's 60 seats in the last elections, held in 1990. That compares
with 32 Tory seats in 1989.
The inquiry has focused on councillors and officials involved in the sale of
council flats, including Dame Shirley Porter and Mr David Weeks, who are
both former leaders of the council, and Mr Barry Legg, the Conservative
group's former chief whip. Mr Legg is now Conservative MP for Milton Keynes
South West.
The auditor has the power to recommend that the councillors involved should
be surcharged if he decides that the council's actions were unlawful.
The conclusions of the report will be closely monitored by the Conservative
party, which presented Westminster council as an example to other local
authorities during the late 1980s.

The National Rivers Authority yesterday reduced most of its flooding alerts
in the south as the heavy rains of the past 10 days eased off.
However a red alert - the highest danger signal - was kept on the River
Lavant in the city of Chichester as the operation to pump water from the
flood-hit county capital of West Sussex continued around the clock. It
rained only moderately in the city, but the river level rose because of
water draining off the Downs.
The measure the authority uses to gauge the risk to the city is the height
of water at the one-metre weir at Grayling Well, north of the city. At one
stage the water rose to 0.934 metres which precipitated flooding in the east
of the city. It fell to 0.834 metres early yesterday only to rise to 0.884
metres yesterday evening.
At this level it constitutes no danger to Chichester but the fear is that
with further rain forecast for the rest of the week, and a spring tide,
which could push water up the river from the sea, the Lavant could again
burst its banks and flood eastern Chichester.
Already 12 families have been evacuated from this area, a number of shops
have reported flooded basements, and schools have been closed. The eastern
part of Chichester is being shored up with sandbag dykes.
Another worry is that the culvert under the city will be unable to take the
volume of water flowing from the Lavant and will burst, flooding the city
centre.
To avoid this, pipes along the main streets in the middle of the city are
draining off 8m gallons of water a day. This represents several inches of
water from the river but may not be enough if there is more heavy rain.
The army is building Bailey bridges in the east of the city to open up the
A27 route to Brighton.

FT  12 JAN 94 / Company gains land use reprieve
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An award-winning company which faced enforcement action to prevent it using
former Ministry of Defence buildings on green belt land for storage was
yesterday given a reprieve.
Mayflower Glass, a manufacturer of decorative glassware which won the
Queen's Award for Export in 1992 and 1993, had been threatened with
enforcement action by South Tyneside council but now has another six months
to resolve its planning problems.
Last Friday the company laid off 50 employees, half its workforce, because
the planning dispute forced it to reduce stocks.
The MoD did not need planning consent because its depot buildings were Crown
property. The company bought them in 1985 from the Property Services Agency
but has been unable to obtain planning permission.
Mr Harry Phipps, chairman and founder, said Mayflower had to have storage
space near its factory, which was located just outside the green belt,
because it had to transport very delicate, part-manufactured products to and
from its warehouse.
He said the planning issue had not been considered a problem when the
company bought the buildings.
After three six-month extensions, the last of which expired on December 31,
the council threatened an enforcement notice. But, after a three-hour
meeting with the company yesterday, it said it would work to help resolve
the problem.
Mr Phipps said the 50 laid-off employees would be asked to return to work
today.

FT  12 JAN 94 / Life houses told to decide whether to support PIA
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Life insurance companies should make up their minds about whether to support
the planned body to regulate retail financial services on the basis of its
prospectus, the Association of British Insurers signalled yesterday.
Following a discussion of the Personal Investment Authority at one of the
ABI board's regular meetings, the association did not support the stance
taken on Monday by Standard Life, one of the UK's leading insurers, that the
composition of the board was in itself enough to withdraw support from the
plans.
The association's position is in line with what it has previously said, but
its re-statement still helps to redress some of the damage done by Standard
Life to the momentum behind the new organisation.
Mr Jim Stretton, deputy managing director of Standard Life, resigned as a
director of the PIA and his company withdrew its support from the
organisation, saying statutory regulation would be preferable to current
plans.
He argued that the PIA's decision that only nine of its 19 directors should
be active in the industry meant that this could not be self-regulation.
Support for the PIA has come from the Scottish life industry although it is
rather unenthusiastic. The eight largest Scottish life offices met
informally on Monday and a majority decided not to withdraw support from the
PIA.
While a number of life companies expressed concern about aspects of the
plans for the PIA, they decided that these were not sufficient to withdraw
their earlier backing of the planned authority.
Mr Mike Ross, managing director of Scottish Widows, the second-largest
Scottish life insurer, said yesterday that while he accepted in principle
the argument made by Mr Stretton, he believed it was too fine a point on
which to withdraw support.
It is likely that some of the public-interest directors will be former
practitioners.
The Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief regulator, is still
braced for further opposition from some life companies.
The PIA is expected to publish its prospectus, on the basis of which it will
apply for recognition from the SIB, around the middle of next month.

FT  12 JAN 94 / Baker 'was unaware' of intelligence connection: Judge
presses former home secretary in arms-for-Iraq probe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The minister who attempted to suppress evidence crucial to the defence of a
businessman charged with exporting arms to Iraq was unaware that the
businessman was supplying the intelligence services with information on
Iraq's military enhancement.
At the Scott inquiry yesterday, Mr Kenneth Baker, former home secretary,
said he was never told about the intelligence role of Mr Paul Henderson, one
of the defendants in the Matrix-Churchill trial, before he signed a public
interest immunity certificate. It authorised the withholding of Whitehall
documents in November 1991.
The justification for Mr Baker's decision was questioned repeatedly by Lord
Justice Scott and his counsel Miss Presiley Baxendale QC. The judge told Mr
Baker at one point in the public hearing: 'It is the absence of any
questioning I am finding a little difficult to understand. There was a
pretty shrewd notion in government circles what the defence would be.'
The judge said the question he was asking himself was whether there should
be greater limitations put on the use of such certificates in the future.
Mr Baker said he had signed the certificate when the case was at its
committal stage following a request from Customs and Excise, which was
prosecuting the Matrix-Churchill case. At that stage Mr Baker was minister
responsible for the intelligence services. He acted on the advice of
government law officers and with the attorney-general's approval.
Mr Baker said: 'It was the role of the home secretary to protect the
operation of the security services, to protect the knowledge of agents,
methods of operations, and technical matters.' Mr Baker was told in broad
terms by his legal advisers that intelligence knew about Matrix-Churchill's
involvement with Iraq, and that it was proposed that an unnamed intelligence
witness would be giving evidence in the trial for the prosecution.
Mr Baker said it would not have been 'appropriate' for him as home secretary
to establish what the defence case would be, nor whether the intelligence
information was relevant to their case. The prosecution, he said, had
advised him that intelligence was only of 'marginal relevance' to the
defence.
The public hearing continues today with evidence from Lord Howe, the former
foreign secretary.

FT  12 JAN 94 / Holiday discounts described as 'myth'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Discounts on holidays being offered by the large travel agency chains are a
myth, as consumers are obliged to buy expensive insurance, Mr Christopher
Kirker, chairman of the Association of Independent Tour Operators, said
yesterday.
Large chains currently offering 11 per cent discounts on summer 1994
holidays were demanding that holidaymakers 'pay two or three times the fair
price for obligatory insurance,' Mr Kirker said.
He added that the discounts were also being funded by tour operators who
were being asked to pay commissions of up to 17.5 per cent if they wanted
their brochures to appear on retailers' racks.
Mr Kirker said consumers' choice of holiday was being limited by the links
between the largest tour operators and travel agents.
He said: 'The time has come for our sector of the industry to expose to the
British public how restricted is their choice at the multiples' high-street
holiday shops, whose recommendations are heavily biased towards their parent
tour operator's product, regardless of their suitability.'
Mr Kirker added that many consumers did not realise that the reason they
were sold a particular holiday was because of incentive agreements between
travel agents and tour operators.
He said there had been a recent case of a customer going into an agency to
request a particular operator's holiday, only to be told that the company
was not a 'recommended brand'. Instead, the agency recommended a holiday
provided by the tour operator which owned it, Mr Kirker said.
He said that the number of holidaymakers who preferred independent travel to
a standard package holiday had increased in recent years.
'We know that our clients demand much more freedom of choice than is
available at a tour operator-owned multiple holiday shop. They want to
choose where they go, when they go, from which airport they wish to fly  -
and they expect to stay in accommodation they have selected for the duration
they need,' he said.

FT  12 JAN 94 / How cross-Channel fare line up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR and MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The eagerly awaited announcement yesterday of Eurotunnel's cross-Channel
fare tables suggests that the company is seeking a premium price in its
first few months of operation, but Eurotunnel's rivals, the ferry operators,
and observers in the travel industry said it could be forced to reduce its
tariffs once the novelty had worn off.
In its early months, Eurotunnel will have limited shuttle capacity and may
be unable to meet demand from first-time users of its service.
But as deliveries of the special rolling stock to carry cars, coaches and
trucks through the 32-mile tunnel build up and the frequency of shuttle
departures increases from two to four an hour, there is a strong chance that
it will be forced to reduce its fares to fill the space available.
P&amp;O European Ferries said: 'There is nothing in the Eurotunnel tariffs to
panic about.' And Hoverspeed said: 'We are very pleased at what has been
revealed and it shows that we are very competitive.'
Stena Sealink was quick to point out that savings of up to Pounds 92 on the
Eurotunnel tariffs are possible from its own peak-season schedule.
Mr Christopher Garnett, Eurotunnel commercial director, stressed yesterday
that the company did not plan to wage a price war. 'We are a unique service
comparable with the impact of the opening of transatlantic airline routes on
the ocean liners,' he said.
Others are not so sure. Mr Keith Betton, head of corporate affairs at the
Association of British Travel Agents, said: 'We expect Eurotunnel will need
to adjust its fares downwards when it comes to attracting travellers for a
second time.'
Travel industry observers are also uncertain about whether Eurotunnel will
be able to maintain its policy of charging the same rate throughout the day.
Stena Sealink last week fell in with this previously announced Eurotunnel
policy when it announced its fares for this year.
But, faced with the prospect of most travellers turning up between 9am and
6pm, Eurotunnel and the ferry operators may find themselves forced to bring
in price incentives to divert travellers to their late-night services.
To help prevent congestion at its Folkestone terminal Eurotunnel will
operate its own radio station to inform drivers if space is available on the
next shuttle.
Motorists will be able to pick up the broadcasts when they reach Maidstone,
about 35 miles from the ferry terminal, and decide if they want to wait for
the next train or drive on to pick up one of the ferries.
Car drivers will be able to use the shuttle from May 8, the day after the
official opening by the Queen and President Mitterrand of France, but trucks
will start travelling through the tunnel on open-sided wagons in March.
Services for coaches and caravans are expected to start on September 5.
The shuttle will make the largest contribution to Eurotunnel's projected
revenues. It is expected to account for Pounds 120m of this year's forecast
revenues of Pounds 224m. The other main source of revenue will be the
passenger-only Eurostar trains which will run from London Waterloo to Paris
and Brussels and contribute estimated revenues of Pounds 86m.
The starting date for this service is expected to be June or July although
European Passenger Services, which will operate the trains on behalf of the
railways of Britain, France and Belgium, is still uncertain about the exact
launch date.
The launch of the Eurostar service will pit the tunnel against the airlines,
which are also expected to fight hard to retain their market share.
It seems certain that yesterday's fares announcement was just the first
piece of the jigsaw.

FT  12 JAN 94 / Major pressed on ministers' role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major, the prime minister, has been asked by Lord Justice Scott to
give his views about ministerial responsibility in the dissemination of
intelligence.
He is being pressed to state whether he subscribes to a set of guidance
notes on ministerial accountability which the judge is using as a working
tool to test some of the evidence which he has heard from Whitehall
officials and ministers.
The notes are in the form of a draft document entitled Ministerial
Accountability for the Failure to Ensure the Proper Dissemination of
Relevant Intelligence.
The document puts the onus of responsibility on individual ministers for
ensuring that intelligence is efficiently gathered and disseminated.
The document states: 'Accountability requires that a failure in the
organisation and structure which results in a failure by the government to
carry out its policies is a matter for which the relevant minister must
answer.
'Answerability requires not only accountability in parliament after the
event; it may require the minister to take an active interest in the
organisation and structure of his department.'
It goes on to state that specifically 'where a minister has the
responsibility for taking decisions in a sensitive area and knows of the
sensitivity of the decisions which he is taking,' he has the duty personally
to assure himself that he is adequately briefed.
An official with the Scott inquiry last night described the guidance notes
as a 'consultation document' which did not necessarily represent the views
which the judge may express in his final report.
The document draws on the procedures for ministers set out by the head of
the civil service and which are supposed to circulate within Whitehall.
It has been alleged that documents made available to the Scott inquiry show
lack of co-ordination and in some cases misuse of intelligence data by
officials and ministers for apparently political ends.
Mr Major is due to appear at the Scott inquiry hearing on Monday. He has
already submitted written evidence.

FT  12 JAN 94 / Directors 'stole' Pounds 2m of fine wine
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Two directors of London wine dealer Green's stole Pounds 2m of fine wines,
vintage port and champagne being stored for customers, Inner London crown
court heard yesterday.
Joseph Mankowitz and Raymond Burroway, who bought the 207-year-old company
in 1990, engineered a bogus sell-off of the storage part of Green's
operations to cover their tracks, said Mr Paul Dodgson, prosecuting.
The 'buyer' was called John Ryan. He had no address and no solicitors acting
for him. He not only paid too much but did so in cash.
Mr Dodgson said it was the prosecution's case that Ryan was a 'stooge' and
the sale was a 'charade' to cover up the theft of 6,800 cases of wine, port
and champagne in the autumn of 1990.
'We say that that was just a fiction, just a smokescreen to try to persuade
the outside world that whatever happened next was not Mr Mankowitz's and Mr
Burroway's fault, but Mr Ryan's,' said Mr Dodgson.
'So in due course when the truth came out . . . you had to have someone
there to blame and the man who would be subsequently blamed was Ryan.'
Mr Mankowitz, 47, of Earls Court, west London, and Mr Burroway, 52, of
Wandsworth, south-west London, deny conspiring to steal the wine. Mr Anthony
Boylan, 58, of Park Road, Dulwich, south-east London, also denies the
charge. He is alleged to have used a false name to remove some of the wine
from storage.
Much of the wine was kept in the company's duty-free bonded warehouses in
London and Wiltshire.
He claimed the Crown could prove that Mr Burroway received Pounds 80,000
from the proceeds of the sale of some of the stolen wine. However, there was
no direct evidence Mr Mankowitz received any money from any sales.
He told the jury that in considering the scenario he had outlined, they
might well feel there was a 'strong case' that the two men, helped by Mr
Boylan, stole the vintage stock.
The trial was adjourned until today.

Yachtsmen are being asked to report vessels outside shipping lanes,
high-speed powerboats far from shore or cargo transfers at sea. Reports from
one ferry company last year led to seven drugs seizures.
The association is to sign a memorandum of understanding with Customs and

President Bill Clinton yesterday put environmental protection, anti-trust
regulations and labour standards at the top of the agenda for future world
trade negotiations.
His stand drew applause from the European Commission in Brussels, where Mr
Clinton held talks on the third day of his maiden presidential trip to
Europe.
Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, followed up with a plea to Mr
Clinton to support a global campaign for a carbon tax. Officials said the
aim was to curb energy consumption and create new tax revenues to make
labour cheaper in Europe.
The need to create jobs was the principal theme of the meeting at the
Commission. All sides described the talks as 'friendly and constructive',
dispelling tensions caused last year over trade and policy toward Bosnia.
Mr Clinton emphasised that the advanced economies of the US, Europe and
Japan had 'common maladies', and could learn much from each other on how to
tackle unemployment and promote economic growth.
He looked forward to a further exchange of ideas at a 'jobs summit' this
spring under the auspices of the Group of Seven countries.
'As we bring others into the orbit of global trade . . . we must ensure that
their policies benefit the interests of their workers and our common
interest in enhancing environmental protection throughout the globe,' Mr
Clinton said.
'I believe that dealing with the environment creates jobs; it does not cost
jobs if you do it in the right way. I think we now have about 20 years of
evidence that supports that.'
The president's new Gatt priorities will encourage France, where Mr Edouard
Balladur, prime minister, recently called for the EU to push for protection
against unfair foreign competition based on lower wages, currency rates and
environmental standards.
But it may disappoint critics at home who want more emphasis on dismantling
barriers to foreign investment and greater EU market access.
Those subjects were covered in separate talks between the Commission and Mr
Mickey Kantor, US trade representative. Brussels officials emphasised that
it would not be easy to reach a deal on full liberalisation of public
procurement contracts by April 15.
The EU says it will withhold full liberalisation of telecommunications
contracts deals until the issue of US contracts below the federal level is
resolved.

European and US fund managers are mounting a campaign to win access to
Japan's tightly guarded pension fund management business as bilateral trade
talks between the US and Japan resume in Tokyo this week.
Frustrated foreign money managers, who have had little success in breaking
into Japan's corporate pension fund management business opened in 1990, are
demanding to be allowed to manage public pension funds, currently restricted
to trust banks and life assurers.
Although US pressure forced the partial liberalisation of fund management
and corporate pension and mutual aid associations, foreign money managers
have failed to gain access to such funds because of the tight relationships
between Japanese corporations and fund managers. For some foreign fund
managers, winning public fund management contracts is the only way they can
justify maintaining operations in Japan.
Meanwhile, the issue is not only a concern for the trade negotiators and
investment managers. Japan's Ministry of Health and Welfare, which holds
jurisdiction over the state pension system, is also unhappy about the
Finance Ministry's tight grip on how the Y100,000bn (Pounds 600bn) in
reserves can be invested.

To the relief of the Brazilian government, Mr Domingo Cavallo, Argentina's
economy minister, has promised to end his scathing attacks on Brazil's
economic policies. Mr Cavallo yesterday said: 'I will not comment any more
about Brazil. I will not answer any more questions about Brazil.'
Mr Cavallo, who in three years transformed Argentina's chaotic and
hyper-inflationary economy, has made a habit of publicly criticising
Brazil's economic policies. He often says these are based on 'hunger' and
'impoverishment of the people'.
Although the Brazilian government has never protested formally, it has made
its displeasure known to Mr Cavallo.
A Brazilian official said yesterday 'we are not going to say anything
because this should have been his attitude right from the start. These
statements harm our relations.'
However, Mr Cavallo, is credited with helping convince Mr Fernando Henrique
Cardoso, Brazil's finance minister, to propose orthodox policies similar to
Argentina's.

FT  12 JAN 94 / World Trade News: Managed trade costs Americans Dollars 70bn
each year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tariff barriers, quotas and other managed trade arrangements in the US cost
American consumers about Dollars 70bn (Pounds 47bn) a year, according to a
study published today by the Washington-based Institute for International
Economics.*
This cost is likely to be pared to around Dollars 30bn over the coming
decade as tariff cuts agreed in the Uruguay Round of global trade
liberalisation take effect.
While Dollars 38bn of the current consumer cost is due to 'normal' low
tariffs averaging 3.5 per cent which affect 60 per cent of US imports, the
remaining Dollars 32bn is due to high tariffs, or 'special protection,' in
21 sectors ranging from canned tuna to ceramic tiles, and maritime services
to machine tools.
'The textile and apparel sectors ..continue to be the Mt Everest of US trade
protection,' say authors Mr Gary Hufbauer and Ms Kimberly Elliott.
They account for Dollars 24bn of the Dollars 32bn consumer cost due to
special protection.
Estimating that 190,000 jobs would be lost if special protection were
eliminated across the 21 high-tariff sectors, the authors say the average
consumer surplus loss for every job saved by protection is Dollars 170,000 -
six times the average annual compensation (wages plus benefits) of
manufacturing workers in the US.
'This figure far exceeds the cost per worker of even a generous adjustment
programme entailing income maintenance, retraining and relocation,' the
study says.
Examining 100 anti-dumping orders outstanding at the end of 1991, the study
finds that these duties raise prices on the Dollars 3bn of imports affected
by an average of 45 per cent.

FT  12 JAN 94 / World Trade News: Overseas comeback for Chrysler - US
carmaker seeks to double retail sales outside North America to 200,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Chrysler, the smallest of the three big US carmakers, is aiming to double
retail sales outside North America to 200,000 by the end of the decade. It
increased such sales by 45 per cent last year to 109,100 and exceeded
100,000 retail sales for the first time since it re-entered international
markets in 1987.
Chrysler was forced to sell most foreign operations at the end of the 1970s
when it came close to financial collapse.
The company has been rejuvenated in the last three years by a drastic
restructuring and a series of highly successful new product launches. It
achieved record profits in the first nine months of last year, and is
leading a resurgent US car industry's drive into export markets.
It increased US car and light truck sales by 19.9 per cent to 2.047m in a
market that grew by 8 per cent, and raised its share of the market to 14.7
per cent, the highest level for 23 years.
Chrysler is still a small player in foreign markets, but sales last year
rose by 36 per cent in Europe, 87 per cent in Latin America and doubled in
the Asia Pacific region. Europe, its main foreign market, accounted for
about 55 per cent of its international sales last year, with 20 per cent in
the Asia/Pacific region, 10 per cent in the Middle East and 11 per cent in
Latin America.
Mr Tom Gale, Chrysler vice president of design and international operations,
said the company planned to launch more new products in international
markets in the next three years than at any time in its history. It would
introduce at least six new left-hand-drive and four new right-hand-drive
models by 1997.
Chrysler was the first of the big three US carmakers to begin to engineer
its North American-built vehicles for right-hand-drive markets such as
Japan, UK and Australia.
Mr Gale said its new Neon small family car and its Jeep Grand Cherokee
four-wheel drive sports/utility vehicle would include right-hand-drive
versions as well as the possibility of a right-hand-drive version of its
next generation Chrysler Voyager multi-purpose vehicle (MPV).
Chrysler is planning to build its Grand Cherokee for international markets
in Graz, Austria from late 1994. It has small volume kit assembly operations
in China, Venezuela, Egypt and Malaysia, and last year agreed two new
vehicle assembly deals in Indonesia and Thailand. It has also started
supplying engines to Mitsubishi for some of the Japanese carmaker's US-built
products.
The company's initial return to international markets was based on its Jeep
four-wheel-drive and Voyager MPV models, but it is now seeking to establish
more of a presence in mainstream passenger car markets helped by radical
renewal of its car range. Last autumn it unveiled its Neon small car, to be
launched in Europe in September in left-hand-drive form.
Last week in Detroit it added its new JA range of large family cars, the
Dodge Stratus/Chrysler Cirrus, which will compete with rivals such as the
Honda Accord and Toyota Camry.

FT  12 JAN 94 / World Trade News: Japan plans to open up its construction
industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japanese officials have been drawing up an action plan to make Japan's
construction market more accessible to foreign companies in a bid to avert
sanctions by the US before a scheduled deadline on January 20.
The plan is likely to include open bidding for public works contracts worth
more than a specified amount and other measures to make it easier for
foreign companies to win contracts in Japan.
The measures will be in line with proposals drawn up in October to make the
construction market more transparent which helped convince the US to
postpone sanctions from October 31 last year to January 20.
Mr Tsutomu Hata, Japan's foreign minister, said yesterday it was up to the
Japanese to take the initiative in opening up its markets rather than
relying on foreign pressure.
Mr Hata signalled that Japan aims to tackle disputes with its trading
partners not through administrative guidance but through deregulation of its
markets. This, he said, could improve the lives of the Japanese people and
open up Japan's markets thus reducing the country's trade surplus.
For Tokyo to try to influence private business matters, while promoting free
trade, would lead to managed trade and that is something Japan should be
careful not to do, he said.
However, US demands for measurable indicators of progress in opening up
Japan's markets to foreign products, for including NTT, the privatised
telecommunications company among organisations for which agreed public
procurement rules would be applied, and for using administrative guidance in
winning greater market access for US cars and car parts in Japanese markets,
have come up against strong resistance among the Japanese authorities and
industry.
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and US president Bill Clinton are scheduled
to announce results of bilateral trade and economic negotiations on February
11.

Fierce opposition by Europe's exporters to European Commission plans to
harmonise medium- and long-term export credit insurance regimes will be
voiced in Brussels today when a delegation representing Germany, Holland,
Spain, France and the UK meets senior Commission officials, David Dodwell,
World Trade Editor, reports from London.
Proposals to limit bank credit cover will top a nine-point list of
complaints about proposed changes.
The Commission is planning to trim cover to 95 per cent of the proportion of
an export contract's value covered by export credit agencies. This contrasts
with the UK practice of covering the full value of a buyer credit.

FT  12 JAN 94 / Mexico seeks truce in armed uprising
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Manuel Camacho, Mexico's newly appointed commissioner for peace and
reconciliation in the southern state of Chiapas, is willing to meet rebel
leaders to reach a political solution to the armed uprising that began last
week.
The former foreign minister said yesterday he would seek a truce as soon as
possible. 'It is necessary to reconstruct the political process in the
region. We will have to reach a dignified political solution for everyone.
We will have to offer, in actions, a real solution to the problems.'
Mr Camacho is a skilful political negotiator. The son of an army doctor, he
has strong family links in the region. His appointment and apparent
willingness to explore every avenue of negotiation is a strong sign that the
Mexican government is looking for a conciliatory solution to the uprising.
Mr Camacho will not receive a salary, and formally his commission will not
represent the government. His appointment on Monday and the replacement of
hardline interior minister Mr Patrocinio Gonza with respected
attorney-general Jorge Carpizo, yesterday helped to revive Mexico's jittery
stock market, which closed 3.8 per cent higher. On Monday the market fell
6.3 per cent, with investors worried about the Chiapas conflict spreading to
other parts of Mexico.
On Monday the defence ministry reported that clashes with rebel forces were
'minimal,' in an indication the conflict was subsiding. The army claimed
that some groups of indigenous peasants had abandonned the rebel forces,
after saying they were forced to participate.
The self-styled Zapatista rebels seized several towns in Chiapas last week.
They demanded a total ceasefire and formal recognition as a condition for
the beginning of dialogue, according to a document handed to a Chiapas
newspaper on Monday night.
The document, signed by Commander Marcos, a rebel leader, demanded that the
Mexican army withdraw from the conflict areas and return to army bases. Mr
Camacho did not address specifically the demands of the rebels, saying he
would have to confirm their veracity.
The document denied that foreigners or clerics were involved in their
movement, as the government has maintained. It said the majority of the
Zapatistas are indigenous peoples from Chiapas, although some followers are
from other social origins and states of the country.
Mr Camacho, who until he lost out in the race to win his party's nomination
to succeed President Carlos Salinas, was Mayor of Mexico City, said: 'It was
not in the interests of the country to follow formulas that in other
countries have led to prolonged violence, great suffering, and an absence of
solutions.'

FT  12 JAN 94 / BCCI probe springs back into action: Abu Dhabi ready to
release detainees and documents
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The flagging investigations into the multi-billion dollar fraud surrounding
the Bank of Credit and Commerce International are about to get a new lease
of life.
For more than two years, a mountain of documents detailing the fraud have
remained locked away in the Gulf state of Abu Dhabi, the bank's majority
shareholder.
Also out of reach have been 10 of the bank's top executives, who are being
tried on fraud charges in the emirate while eight more have had their
passports confiscated.
Under a deal struck with US investigators at the weekend, Abu Dhabi has
agreed to make the documents and the detainees available to US prosecutors.
The emirate has also agreed to extradite the bank's former number two, Mr
Swaleh Naqvi, to the US, where he faces fraud charges.
The deal is an important turning point for the US investigators, who have
led the worldwide inquiries into BCCI. Alongside Mr Robert Morgenthau, the
New York district attorney, they include the justice department and the
federal reserve, both of which were also involved in negotiating the
agreement.
While claiming success for the work so far, Mr Morgenthau admitted
investigations have been held back by lack of access to the records and
witnesses held in Abu Dhabi.
The prosecution record over recent months bears out the difficulties.
Less than six months after BCCI was closed, four BCCI entities pleaded
guilty to fraud charges and agreed to pay Dollars 550m (Pounds 368m) in
fines, costs and restitution in the US.
Then, in mid-1992, Mr Kamal Adham, a former Saudi Arabian intelligence
chief, pleaded guilty to helping BCCI illegally acquire control of First
American Bankshares in the US, along with an associate.
These successes have not been matched in recent months. Last summer, Mr
Robert Altman, a Washington lawyer and former president of First American,
was acquitted on fraud charges. Similar charges against Mr Clark Clifford, a
former US secretary of state, were dropped due to his ill health.
Other criminal cases have also been dropped. On December 23, Mr Morgenthau
gave up charges against Sheikh Khalid bin Mahfouz, the former head of
National Commercial Bank, Saudi Arabia's largest bank, in a deal under which
Sheikh Khalid has paid Dollars 225m to meet civil claims against him.
Under the terms of the latest deal, US prosecutors have also agreed not to
bring any criminal charges against Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan al-Nahyan, the
ruler of Abu Dhabi, or any Abu Dhabi officials.
A beneficiary of this arrangement is Mr Ghanim al Mazrui, head of Sheikh
Zayed's department of personal affairs and a man singled out by former BCCI
auditors Price Waterhouse as allegedly being fully aware of the fraud long
before it was known to regulators.
However, Abu Dhabi officials have maintained they are the biggest victims of
the fraud, rather than its perpetrators.
A case against Abu Dhabi officials could yet be mounted elsewhere. The deal
with the US authorities does not preclude prosecutors in the UK, where the
bank had its head office, or Luxembourg, where much of it was legally based,
from pursuing their own charges.
Yet if the deal closes off some avenues of investigation in the US, it will
open others. Mr Naqvi represents the biggest prize so far for US
prosecutors. He will be extradited within 120 days, which Abu Dhabi hopes
will allow time for its own criminal trial against him to be concluded.
Even if found guilty and sentenced in the Gulf state, Mr Naqvi will be
handed over to the US authorities before serving any prison sentence there.
Also, the availability of the so-called 'Naqvi files' - more than 1m pages
of documents assembled by Mr Naqvi - could provide the sort of ammunition
prosecutors need to kick-start a number of investigations.
In addition, Abu Dhabi has agreed to give US investigators access by the end
of next week to the 10 men, including Mr Naqvi, who remain in detention in
the Gulf emirate.
The new information could bring fresh criminal charges in the US. The
justice department, for one, has said it might yet reopen the case against
Mr Altman and Mr Clifford.
The Naqvi files could also provide evidence to back the allegations of
bribery of government officials in many of the countries in which BCCI
operated, including the UK.
The agreement does not prevent the US authorities from passing on evidence
to authorities in other countries.
One man notably absent in this flurry of deal-making is Mr Agha Hassan
Abedi, BCCI's chief architect.
At home in Pakistan, and reportedly a very sick man, the elderly Mr Abedi
has resisted efforts to move him to either Abu Dhabi or the US for trial.

<TEXT>
Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US treasury secretary, set off yesterday on a
round-the-world trip aimed at forging closer ties with emerging capitalist
markets, Reuter reports from Washington.
'My agenda is simple: strengthen economic relations and improve
opportunities for American goods, investment and financial services,' Mr
Bentsen said.
He starts the trip with a visit to Moscow, where he will take part in the
summit between President Clinton and President Boris Yeltsin. Mr Bentsen
believes Russia's economic woes stem not from too much economic reform, as
Mr Yeltsin's political foe, ultra-nationalist Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky,
asserts, but from too little.
He goes on to Indonesia, Thailand and China and will seek to build on Mr
Clinton's summit with Asian leaders of last November.
'The Asian Pacific region is the fastest growing economic region in the
globe,' Mr Bentsen said. 'We need to make a greater effort to see that the
growth taking place in the Pacific encourages growth not only here in the US
but also among other industrial nations.'

The first shots in a renewed air fares war on the London-Dublin route, have
been fired this week, with the inauguration yesterday of a service by Virgin
Atlantic from the Docklands London City Airport to Dublin, aimed primarily
at the business traveller, Tim Coone writes from Dublin. Both British
Midland, which flies into Heathrow, and Ryanair into Luton and Stansted from
Dublin, have in the past few days announced new low fares on their routes
and/or a relaxation of budget fare rules.

<TEXT>
Fierce opposition by Europe's exporters to European Commission plans to
harmonise medium- and long-term export credit insurance regimes will be
voiced in Brussels today when a five-country delegation meets senior
commission officials, David Dodwell, World Trade Editor, reports from
London.
Proposals to limit the level of bank credit cover will be at the top of a
nine-point list of complaints about proposed changes. The Commission is
planning to trim cover to 95 per cent of the proportion of an export
contract's value covered by export credit agencies. This contrasts with the
UK practice of covering the full value of a buyer credit.
Leading today's delegation - representing exporters from Germany, Holland,
Spain, France and the UK - Mr Keith Johnson, export finance manager of
Siemens Plessey and deputy chairman of the British Exporters' Association,
said harmonisation plans reflected 'introspective activity by EU officials',
largely for the convenience of treasuries across Europe, which are trying to
reduce their support for exporters.

Both sides started drafting paragraphs on agreed issues such as the role and

such as the size of the Jericho enclave and border crossings control.
PLO officials insisted the Taba talks were not limited to what Israel calls
the 'Cairo understandings' that emerged last month. The PLO delegation,
headed by Mr Nabil Shaath, appeared to have changed negotiating strategy on
the size of Jericho, focusing on specific geographical demands rather than a

Fourteen African nations which use the CFA franc yesterday agreed to devalue
their French-backed common currency from 50 to the French franc to 100 to
FFr1, buckling to pressure from France and the IMF, AP reports from Dakar.
The move will make their exports more competitive, but will raise import
prices and could lead to social turmoil in countries already beset by
political instability.
The 14 nations faced pressure from International Monetary Fund
director-general Michel Camdessus, who along with France had pressed for the
currency to be devalued. The IMF had threatened to withhold loans and aid.
The Communaute Financiere Africaine franc, or CFA, has been pegged at 50 to
the French franc for 46 years. The CFA countries are Senegal, Comores,
Burkina Faso, Equatorial Guinea, Ivory Coast, Chad, Benin, Central African
Republic, Congo, Gabon, Niger, Togo, Cameroon and Mali.

FT  12 JAN 94 / Editor resigns after clash with Berlusconi: Media magnate
tries to bend newspaper to his political ambitions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Silvio Berlusconi, Italy's media magnate, has received a setback to his
political ambitions following the resignation yesterday of the editor of one
of the country's most respected newspapers.
Mr Indro Montanelli, veteran editor of the Milan-based Il Giornale and a
pillar of Italian journalism, said he would set up a rival paper after
growing conflicts with the Berlusconi family.
Il Giornale, which loses money heavily, was until recently owned by Mr
Berlusconi. In 1992, ownership passed to his younger brother Paolo, in order
to meet new media laws limiting cross holdings in newspapers and television.
In spite of the formal change, Mr Berlusconi is still considered the
dominant commercial influence on the paper.
Although Mr Berlusconi is not believed to have interfered in Il Giornale's
editorial content, differences have surfaced recently because of Mr
Berlusconi's political activities. He has been trying to create a new centre
force to fill the vacuum left by the disintegrating Christian Democrat
party.
So great has Mr Berlusconi's commitment to his cause become that many
marketing staff within his Fininvest group are believed to have been
reassigned to help create a political pressure group, the Club Forza Italia,
and select potential parliamentary candidates.
That has been accompanied by a string of public statements by the normally
reticent Mr Berlusconi. In an apparent attempt to model himself on Mr Ross
Perot, the entrepreneur who contested the 1992 US presidential elections, Mr
Berlusconi has been speaking out on a variety of populist issues, most
recently taxation.
Il Giornale has, however, retained its strong support for Mr Mario Segni, a
former Christian Democrat who is also trying to rally the political middle
ground.
Matters reached a head at the weekend, when an uninvited Mr Berlusconi
attended a meeting of Il Giornale's journalists and apparently linked new
investments to raise profitability to a change in the paper's tone.
Interviewed by Corriere della Sera, the leading Milan daily, soon
afterwards, Mr Montanelli said Mr Berlusconi had committed a 'colossal
gaffe' and that a split was now inevitable. Speaking of Mr Berlusconi, Mr
Montanelli said: 'He thinks he is a cross between Churchill and de Gaulle,
and he really believes it.'

FT  12 JAN 94 / Warning as company cuts retirement age
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The decision by a Japanese company to lower its mandatory retirement age by
four years has triggered concerns about the deteriorating labour environment
and led to a strong warning by the labour ministry against other companies
taking similar moves.
Okuma, a leading machine tool maker, has applied to the employment
authorities for permission temporarily to lower its mandatory retirement age
from 60 to 56, in an effort to cut costs amid a sharp downturn in its
businesses.
The move led to a rare public warning by Mr Chikara Sakaguchi, Minister of
Labour, that Okuma's move runs counter to a bill the ministry plans to
submit soon to the Diet requiring employers to set the retirement age at 60,
and would have serious social implications.
While Okuma's temporary measure was agreed with its union, and the company
said it intends to raise the retirement age to 60 as soon as possible,the
labour ministry has launched a hearing into the matter.
Mr Sakaguchi stressed that similar moves would lead to stringent guidance
and warnings by the ministry. There is mounting concern in Japan about
changes to the country's traditional labour contract.
As Okuma's move shows, older employees are often victims of increasing
company attempts to reduce labour costs. The problem is that Japan's
corporate system encourages employees to devote a large part of their peak
years to the company with the promise of rising salaries and benefits as
they gain seniority.
Older employees forced to leave earlier than they had counted on are thus
being told to forfeit the benefits they feel are rightly theirs after
decades of devotion to the company cause. A labour ministry study last
autumn found 60 per cent of companies surveyed had implemented labour
adjustment measures, such as restrictions on overtime work, secondments or
transfers within the company, and temporary closures.
Unemployment in Japan rose for three months to reach a six-year high of 2.8
per cent last November. Nikkeiren, Japan's Federation of Employers
Associations, yesterday took the initiative in setting the mood for the
spring wage round by suggesting a wage freeze this year.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ms Ryoko Akamatsu, Japan's education minister, was forced to apologise to
the public yesterday for a ministry official's alleged involvement in a
bribery scandal.
Police arrested Mr Toshio Yamamura, chief of the ministry's university
division, for allegedly receiving more than Y500,000 (Pounds 3,000) from
officials at Sugiyama Jogakuen University, a women's university in central
Japan, in return for approval to change faculty names.
The disclosure has caused embarrassment to the ministry, which was involved
in the Recruit stocks-for-favours scandal in 1988. 'If the allegations are
true, it is regrettable,' said Ms Akamatsu, who had warned ministry
officials about ethical conduct after the construction scandals last year.
The case reflects the myriad regulations an institution has to clear before
setting up new departments or faculties.
An increasing number of Japanese schools face a sharp fall in the number of
students due to demographic changes, and are forced to try to improve their
images in order to attract applicants.
Mr Yamamura, who was in charge of handling applications from private
universities to set up new departments, approved Sugiyama Jogakuen's plan to
remodel its domestic science department to the department of life sciences
in 1990.
Setting up new faculties or changing the names of departments can take up to
two years. The three university officials who allegedly handed over the
money were also arrested.

FT  12 JAN 94 / Deeper payments crisis in prospect: Debt servicing expected
to swallow up foreign exchange earnings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ADAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ABUJA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Nigeria's budget, reversing economic reform, has left the country with no
prospect of satisfying International Monetary Fund terms for debt
rescheduling and will deepen the balance of payments crisis.
Nigeria needs to reschedule last year's unpaid debts to the Paris Club of
official creditors, worth more than Dollars 4.5bn, but the Fund's mission
due in Lagos later this month, is unlikely to produce a clean bill of health
in view of the increased regulation of the economy, removal of export
incentives and the continued funding of uneconomic industrial projects
outlined in the budget.
Without rescheduling, external debt service this year is expected to reach
Dollars 6bn, or 97 per cent of foreign exchange earnings, according to
finance minister Mr Kalu Idika Kalu.
The government has provided for Dollars 1.8bn of external debt payments this
year, out of forecast government revenue of Dollars 6.5bn based on an Opec
oil production quota of 1.8m barrels a day at an average price of Dollars 14
per barrel. The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) will receive
more than 62 per cent of forecast revenue to fund its joint ventures with
the international oil companies. According to Mr Don Etiebet, the oil
minister, this year's budget allocation would make up the shortfall in
investment in recent years which has seen NNPC fail to meet its costs for
the past six months and a decline in Nigeria's production capacity.
The budget gives priority to some notorious projects such as the Ajaokuta
steel works, the aluminium smelter and the new capital in Abuja which,
according to a budget monitoring committee set up by previous head of state
Mr Ernest Shonekan, should no longer be funded. The remainder of the budget
leaves little scope to maintain the size of government and its target of a
balanced budget would require harsh cuts in spending.
The budget is a U-turn in policy for the finance minister who has argued
forcefully until now for complete deregulation of the economy and an early
medium-term agreement with the IMF. Mr Kalu said in Abuja yesterday that he
saw the budget measures as inevitable if Nigeria is to stimulate industrial
output, estimated to be about 35 per cent of capacity, and stabilise the
value of the naira, which fell from about N25 to the dollar to about N49 to
the dollar in the past 12 months on the parallel market.
Mr Kalu, who was finance minister in 1986 when former military president
General Ibrahim Babangida floated the naira to free the Nigerian economy,
said Gen Abacha's measures were not a 'total retreat from free markets'.
He justified the ban on free movement of capital into Nigeria by saying that
the government had to ensure that priority sectors were adequately funded.
This is despite official figures showing that over 75 per cent of foreign
exchange sold by the government went directly to industry.
'This must be the only government in the world which thinks that you can
strengthen the foreign exchange rate by cutting interest rates,' said a
banker in Lagos yesterday.
The 1994 policy places a large burden on the Central Bank of Nigeria which
has to allocate scarce foreign exchange to commercial banks for on-lending
to priority customers. This system has been applied in Nigeria before and
led to widespread abuse.
The head of a leading industrial company said yesterday: 'We have tried
policing before in Nigeria and it has never worked. These measures are
especially damaging to exporters who no longer have an incentive.' Many
businessmen are sceptical.
The ban on free movement of export proceeds could have a devastating effect
on the cocoa crop, Nigeria's second largest source of export earnings. Cocoa
farmers who are earning N51,000 per tonne this season will receive only
21,000 per tonne from exporters if they are paid at the rate of N22 to the
dollar. Mr Paul Ogwuma, the central bank governor, said the new regulations
were needed in 1994 to bring sanity to the foreign exchange market. The
situation could be reviewed next year if the government found the controls
were no longer needed.

FT  12 JAN 94 / Japan's reform bills head for last hurdle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's coalition government yesterday took a big step toward getting final
parliamentary agreement, by next week, for plans to reform the discredited
political system.
Leaders of the seven parties yesterday agreed to put the four reform bills
to the vote in the upper house of parliament today week - the last hurdle
before they become law.
The government is expected to win the vote narrowly, thus leaving it free to
table an urgent and much-delayed economic stimulation package.
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa aims to present the economic package a day
later, on January 20, though it might be delayed because coalition members
remain divided over how to fund a proposed income tax cut. The prospect of
an end to the stalemate over the economy has contributed to a 6.4 per cent
rise in Tokyo share prices over the past week.
The opposition Liberal Democratic party yesterday paved the way for a reform
vote by reluctantly deciding to stop delaying the plans. 'We are angered by
the forceful tactics of the coalition ..but will solemnly take part in the
deliberations,' said Mr Tomio Yamamoto, leader of the LDP in the upper
house.
Mr Yohei Kono, LDP president, is expected to meet Mr Hosokawa early next
week to negotiate a compromise. A victory on political reform would conclude
a troubled five-year national debate on the issue, which has led to the
downfall of two prime ministers and provoked the biggest upheaval in
national politics since the war.
Mr Hosokawa split the LDP and forced the reform package through the lower
house two months ago, in a departure from the tradition of forming a
cross-party consensus on important legislation. He has tried to avoid a
forced vote in the upper house because the coalition's majority there is
both smaller and more fragile than in the lower chamber.
The coalition only has 131 of the 251 upper house seats. They include seats
held mainly by rebels in the Social Democratic party, the coalition's
largest but least dependable partner. Mr Tomiichi Murayama, Socialist party
chairman, yesterday tried to enforce discipline by ordering members at the
party's annual convention to support the bills.
The plans will replace the present system of multi-seat lower house
constituencies with a mixture of single seats and proportional
representation, and curb corporate political funding.
But it is unclear whether Mr Murayama has the authority to pull into line
the 10 or so upper house Socialist members who oppose reform on the grounds
that they believe the party, humiliated in the last election, will do even
worse under the new system.

The Nigerian military government's decision to abandon policies of
market-based economic reform has caused consternation to foreign aid donors
and international lending institutions.
International economists say that the budget announced on Monday, which cuts
interest rates and reimposes foreign exchange controls, is likely to lead to
empty shelves in Lagos shops and to the emergence of a thriving black market
in foreign currency.
With interest rates cut to 12-15 per cent while inflation runs at 50-60 per
cent, credit is likely to expand rapidly, fuelling further inflation.
The low interest rates and fixed exchange rates are likely to prove popular
among Nigerian manufacturers and importers who can get access to foreign
currency, but could prove devastating to the country's economic growth
prospects.
Although officials from the International Monetary Fund are due to visit
Lagos later this month for regular consultations, the chances that their
talks might lead to any agreement on future lending, already faint, are now
thought to have been extinguished by Monday's budget.
The IMF's last agreement with Nigeria expired nearly two years ago, and the
country has not been servicing its external debts since then, accumulating
around Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.35bn) of arrears on Dollars 31bn of outstanding
debts.
Several foreign aid donors, including the US and the UK, imposed some
symbolic sanctions on Nigeria last June following the annulment by the
military regime of a presidential election which appeared to have been won
by Mr Moshood Abiola.
Since General Sani Abacha seized power in November, donors have been
assessing stiffer aid cuts. Besides the reversal of economic reform
policies, several countries are disturbed that the government seems to have
dropped even the rhetoric of transparency and financial accountability,
which was much discussed last year by the short-lived government of Mr
Ernest Shonekan.
International analysts view the Nigerian government's new economic programme
as one of the most damaging setbacks so far to a general trend towards
market economics in Africa, and link the reversal to General Abacha's
seizure of power.
'General Abacha likes to command everything, including the economy. He
thinks he can just order prices down, and everything will be normal,' said
one European diplomat.

FT  12 JAN 94 / European carmakers' sales hopes collapse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL

<TEXT>
European carmakers yesterday downgraded their forecasts for sales growth in
1994, and called on Japanese exporters to freeze their share of the European
Union market.
Mr Giorgio Garuzzo, new president of the European automobile manufacturers'
association (ACEA), warned that sales growth in the UK and perhaps in
France, would not compensate for a continued decline in the rest of the EU.
He said sales across the EU would grow by between 1 and 2 per cent. In
October, ACEA forecast 2.9 per cent growth for 1994.
The 1991 EU-Japan agreement on Japanese exports of cars and light vehicles
foresees a gradual opening of the EU market, with the abolition of national
quotas by the end of the decade. When the EU market is growing, Japan is
allowed to increase its market share.
But Mr Garuzzo, who is chief operating officer of Fiat of Italy, said
yesterday that the Japanese had already pushed up their slice of the market
from 11.3 per cent in 1992 to around 12 per cent in 1993, while new car
passenger registrations in the EU fell 15.3 per cent.
'We believe that the spirit of the agreement would require ..a temporary
freeze of (Japanese) market share, (while) such an ice-age continues in
Europe,' Mr Garuzzo told a press conference at the opening of the Brussels
motor show.
Last year, the European Commission underestimated the downturn in the EU
market, and had to press for revision of the original Japanese export
target.
The Japanese authorities eventually agreed in September to limit vehicles
entering the EU to 980,000 units, down 17.6 per cent on 1992. Commission and
Japanese officials will meet next month for their first serious discussion
of 1994 forecasts.
ACEA took the opportunity to launch a paper on industrial restructuring of
the motor industry, which calls on the Commission and national governments
to support the manufacturers as they adapt to greater Japanese competition.
For example, ACEA is calling for particular efforts to complete the single
market - by harmonising tax systems which distort car prices - focus certain
research programmes on industrial technologies to help the industry, and
support training and retraining of car workers.
However, Mr Garuzzo said the European industry was quietly adapting to
competition, and there was 'no reason to think that we shall be weaker than
the Japanese in the next century.'

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Thailand's cabinet yesterday approved a financial liberalisation package
which allows foreign banks with offshore banking licences to open branches
outside Bangkok, relaxes foreign exchange controls, and encourages Thai
finance and securities companies to separate the two sides of their
business.
The reforms, which fulfil government promises made last year, were approved
a week before a visit to Thailand by Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US treasury
secretary.
Mr Bentsen is expected to ask Thailand to open its protected financial
services sector to more foreign competition following last month's
completion of the Uruguay Round of Gatt world trade talks.
Foreign banks with offshore licences under the Bangkok International Banking
Facility will be allowed to establish two branches outside Bangkok, and each
branch will be able to lend up to Bt1bn (Pounds 26m) in Thai baht as well as
granting foreign currency loans.
Some foreign bankers were doubtful about the advantages of opening BIBF
branches outside Bangkok, but the government is expected to announce further
reforms which would permit foreign banks to operate full conventional
branches in the provinces.
'What we are really waiting for is the day when we can handle payments and
do foreign exchange like a full branch,' said Mr Anders Lundquist, chief
representative of Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken in Bangkok. 'We see the BIBF
as a stepping stone to a full branch.'
Mr David Hendrix, general manager of Citibank Thailand, said he thought some
bankers would act on the proposal for upcountry BIBF branches, particularly
since multinational and other companies were tending to move out of Bangkok
to less congested locations in the provinces.
'It's all healthy and it's all moving in the right direction,' Mr Hendrix
said.
As well as confronting Thailand's 15 commercial banks with limited
competition from foreign banks, the government has decided to allow Thai
finance companies to open provincial loan offices. Initially, they will be
able to lend money, and after two years those that are sufficiently sound
will be permitted to take deposits. Ultimately they may be upgraded to
banks.

FT  12 JAN 94 / Accord raises German pay hopes: Chemicals workers accept
award below forecast inflation level
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
West German chemicals workers yesterday accepted real wage cuts in return
for more job security. The late- night agreement on a 2 per cent award
reinforced hopes of similar settlements in other industries which would
increase downward pressure on inflation and short-term interest rates.
The 15-month deal was equivalent to an annual increase of 1.5 per cent
compared with expected average inflation of around 3 per cent, economists
said. It coincided with the release of data which showed the economy still
in recession and in need of fresh stimulation to fuel recovery.
West German gross domestic product showed no growth in the final quarter of
last year and was 0.7 per cent lower than in the comparable part of 1992,
according to provisional figures from the federal statistics office. The
recessive trend had ended but it was not yet possible to divine when the
economy would start to improve, the office said.
However, Mr Gunter Rexrodt, economics minister claimed the 1.3 per cent drop
in pan-German GDP for the full year, reported on Monday, concealed a slight
recovery which had started after the sharp collapse in the first quarter.
Mr Richard Reid, chief economist at Union Bank of Switzerland in Frankfurt,
said if the chemicals workers' pay deal set a pattern for other industries
it was 'extremely good news'.
Taken together with the economic data, it would not be long before markets
started considering the outcome of next week's Bundesbank council meeting,
he added. There was a good chance of a rate cut if inflation and money
supply showed signs of slowing growth.
Most independent economists agree that the key discount rate, currently 5.75
per cent, will be down to 4 per cent by the end of the year. Two of
Germany's leading economic institutes last week urged the bank to cut rates.
The chemicals pay deal, widely welcomed as good news for industry, includes
a 15-month contract, back-dated to the end of October. The 2 per cent
increase will take effect next month. Other elements include agreement that
employers can take on long-term unemployed workers at 90 per cent of basic
pay rates and shorten working hours according to market needs.
The provisional 1993 economic data showed that the steepest slump in western
Germany since the war was marked by a 14.7 per cent drop in spending on
plant and equipment. Public consumption in the region fell 1.3 per cent,
while private consumption, equivalent to 50 per cent of GDP, stagnated.
Exports fell 7.3 per cent and imports were down 10.8 per cent.
In the east, where GDP rose 6.3 per cent after 9.7 per cent in 1992, capital
investment rose 15 per cent while spending on construction rose 21 per cent
Numbers employed in the whole of the country fell almost 720,000, while the
number of registered jobless climbed 440,000 or 14.8 per cent. Pan-German
disposable incomes rose 2.8 per cent, comprising a 2.2 per cent rise in the
west and an increase of 7 per cent in the east.

Latvia and Lithuania have agreed to build a new Baltic Sea oil terminal in
the Latvian port of Liepaja, Reuter reports from Moscow. Agreement was
reached at talks between the prime ministers of the two former Soviet
republics, Latvian radio said.
Interfax news agency said last month that Latvia and Lithuania were planning
to form a joint venture to build the terminal, 51 per cent owned by
Lithuania and 49 per cent by Latvia.
Latvia had previously proposed a joint terminal at its Ventspils port, but
Lithuania rejected the site. Lithuania wants the terminal to help diversify
supplies for its Mazeikiai refinery, at present dependent on Russian
supplies.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Russia yesterday inaugurated its first multi-party parliament.
'This is a disgrace,' muttered Mr Sergei Kovalyov, a veteran human rights
campaigner and a leader of Russia's Choice, the radical reform bloc set up
by leading reformist ministers.
'This is a joke,' fumed Mr Boris Fyodorov, finance minister, after the
morning session rowed for four hours over whether to take a break. 'This is
not a joke,' disagreed Mr Grigory Yavlinsky, head of the reformist Yabloko
bloc. 'It's the beginning of democracy, of something like a parliament. The
west had 200 to 300 years to develop democracy while we have had just a
few.'
Meanwhile, stung by accusations that he represents a serious threat to
democracy, Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the ultra-nationalist leader, tried hard
to project an image of respectability, but finally gave up and began
shouting.
To the applause of his Liberal Democrats, the second largest group in
parliament after Russia's Choice, Mr Zhirinovsky ordered the chamber to stop
trying to remove Mr Georgy Lukava - a member of his party who by virtue of
being the oldest deputy was serving as temporary speaker.
But Mr Zhirinovsky's help was not enough to stop the 68-year-old academic in
military uniform from sinking into the parliamentary quicksand. Error
followed error and Mr Lukava finally agreed to share his job with senior
citizens from the other factions.
Not that the parliament is short of experienced deputies, with the chamber
reading like a Who's Who from its two predecessors. Most prominent was Mr
Anatoly Lukyanov, speaker of the Soviet parliament accused of masterminding
the 1991 coup d'etat against Mr Gorbachev. As Mr Lukava floundered away,
many saw Mr Lukyanov as an ideal speaker for all his past sins.
But after two years in jail and with possible charges still pending after
the failure of the coup trial to come to any conclusions, he looked tired
and fragile and said he had no desire to return to the speaker's chair.
Meanwhile, the shadow of Mr Zhirinovsky and his likely alliance with the
Communists, Agrarians, and ultra-nationalists, had the pro-democracy forces
on high-alert, resorting to every filibuster they could think of to
influence events.
As the Liberal Democrats tried to hurry along procedural votes Russia's
Choice first threatened to walk out and then refused to register its
deputies, successfully depriving the assembly of a quorum and ensuring that
the logistics of the new parliament were as chaotic as its first
deliberations.

FT  12 JAN 94 / Poll campaign strains ties that bind Crimea: The republic's
dangerous tensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JILL BARSHAY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SIMFEROPOL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Crimea's first presidential elections, due next Sunday, are providing a new
and dangerous focal point for the republic's competing loyalties to the
states of Ukraine and Russia.
Sensitivities over the republic's status run high in both Moscow and Kiev,
not just as an issue of territorial integrity, but also as the home of the
disputed Black Sea fleet, now awkwardly shared between the two states.
Ethnic Russians make up roughly 70 per cent of Crimea's population and
Ukraine's President Leonid Kravchuk has been hard pressed to respect their
interests while also satisfying the demands of Ukrainian nationalists.
A compromise solution, in April 1992, was Kiev's proclamation of Crimea as
an 'autonomous part of the Ukraine'. The constitution that followed set up
the office of Crimean president, but the republic's moderates sought to
stall an election, well aware of the nationalist sentiment that it was
likely to arouse. In the end, they could hold it off no longer, and the
possibility of a realignment with Russia now looms large.
Only one of the four front-runners, Mr Nikolai Bagrov, who is Crimean
parliamentary chairman, is advocating the republic's continued status as a
province of Ukraine - which it has been since Russia handed it over in 1954.
The others all favour some form of reunification with Russia.
The Crimean parliament has already declared independence from Ukraine once,
in May 1992, and threatened a referendum on joining Russia. However, it
quickly caved in to Ukrainian pressure to reverse its stand. Nonetheless, it
has gained more autonomy than any other Ukrainian region, including the
right to levy its own taxes and establish foreign trade representations, and
Mr Kravchuk will be reluctant to let the republic move further away from
Kiev.
Moreover, if the vote went against Ukraine, or if Kiev anyway acted to
strengthen its hold on the Black Sea peninsula, Russia would now be more
likely to step in 'to protect the interests of Russians living in the near
abroad,' as Mr Andrei Kozyrev, Russia's foreign minister, stated recently.
But there seems little awareness that the elections could provide the
justification for interventions by either Ukraine or Russia. The campaign
has been dominated, instead, by illusions of the republic's economic
potential with Russia's patronage.
Since becoming part of independent Ukraine in 1991, Crimea's 2.5m residents
have seen their fortunes decline with the tumbling Ukrainian currency, the
karbovanets.
One leading candidate, the Communist party leader Mr Nikolai Grach, is
promising the return of a socialist state through the creation of an
economic union with reforming Russia. His rhetoric of workers' rights and
social welfare guarantees rings well with Crimea's influential pensioners: a
third of the populace are privileged retired Communists in the peninsula's
fashionable coastal resorts.
The most extreme is Mr Sergei Shuvainikov, a nationalist representing
Crimea's Party of Russia, which has ties to Mr Zhirinovsky's
ultra-nationalist Liberal Democratic party. He wants to unite with Russia
immediately, through executive order.
Mr Yuri Meshkov, a pro-Russian candidate whose headquarters are a seedy
Afghan war veterans' cafe, tries hard to portray himself as a moderate
advocate of Crimean independence, but promises to 'create a single economic
zone with Russia' and hold a referendum on uniting with Russia.
Mr Meshkov admits that Russia has not yet said it will agree to absorb
Crimea, but he is convinced that 'Russia's policy toward Crimea is one thing
 -Ukraine is another. We're part of the Russian people. It's like the
relationship between England and Yorkshire, not between England and
Scotland.'
Mr Meshkov asserts that his pro-Russian programme can be implemented
peacefully, without pitting Crimea against Ukraine.
'I don't see a reason for Kiev to be upset. Kravchuk said at the end of
December that 'what goes on in Crimea is Crimea's business'.'
Mr Meshkov also plays down the importance of the 700,000 ethnic Ukrainians
and 300,000 Crimean Tatars on the peninsula.
'There are no social divisions in Crimea, little support for Rukh (the
Ukrainian nationalist movement), to catalyse such a conflict.'
Both the Crimean Tatars and Rukh are expected to vote for Mr Bagrov, who was
seen as a front-runner although pre-election opinion polls have been legally
forbidden.
However, despite support from business interests seeking stability, his
popularity has reportedly waned as the Ukrainian economy has deteriorated.
Initially, Crimeans thought they would be better off economically apart from
Moscow. But now they are hostage to Kiev's economic mismanagement and must
cope with hyperinflation and severe energy shortages with the loss of
virtually free Russian oil and gas.
'Ninety per cent of Crimea's enterprises are in a critical state,' says Mr
Vladimir Sheviyev, one of Crimea's wealthiest entrepreneurs and a supporter
of Mr Bagrov.
The energy crisis has shut down 35 per cent of Crimea's enterprises and
forced another 55 per cent to operate at half capacity. Most aircraft at the
capital's airport are grounded for lack of fuel. By contrast, Russia is
perceived as an oasis of riches.
'Everyone I know is debating between Shuvainikov and Meshkov,' said a young
Crimean militia officer en route to his village for the Slavic Orthodox
Christmas.
'With Russia we'll have a real currency and oil. They'll take care of us.'

FT  12 JAN 94 / EMI twelve peruse house ads: The first meeting of EU's
'homeless' bankers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday, on or around the spot on which Charlemagne convened his Imperial
Council of spiritual and temporal leaders of the Frankish empire in 794,
Europe's monetary monitors gathered to discuss housing, pay and conditions.
The 12 governors of the European Union's central banks, under the presidency
of Mr Alexandre Lamfalussy, met formally for the first time under the banner
of the European monetary institute, ground-breaker for the proposed European
central bank.
Under a marquetry representation of the German eagle in the Frankfurt city
hall, Mr Lamfalussy disclosed to the press last night that he had
short-listed the city's obelisk-like Messeturm building and the nearby
Poseidon building as potential homes. Since the Bundesbank already occupies
several floors of the Messeturm, pundits favoured Poseidon as the diplomatic
choice.
Mr Lamfalussy did not expect to move in for some months, however, because
there was a lot of 'housekeeping' to be done. He also had to find a director
general to report directly to him. Offers were clearly not welcome. He
personally, he stressed, would nominate a candidate.
Yesterday's meeting had agreed on the organisational base. A total workforce
of up to 250 people would be built up gradually to service five department
heads: economics and statistics, a general secretariat, administration,
reserve management and information systems and communications.
The department heads would be paid at around the rates on which European
Commission A2-grade directeurs currently subsist. The director-general was
worth the Brussels A1 rate, while it had been proposed he be paid a
commission vice-president's salary.
Yesterday's 'symbolic' appearance in the EMI's future home also elected Mr
Maurice Doyle, governor of the Bank of Ireland, as the institute's
vice-president. Mr Lamfalussy defended his colleague against press charges
of lack of seniority with a hymn of praise for Ireland's remarkable
macro-economic record. As a representative of a relatively poor EU member,
he added, Mr Doyle would bring to the institute a 'sensitivity' to the needs
of poorer countries.
As to the EMI's functions, Mr Lamfalussy was less precise. Its role was
'freely interpretable' in some ways, he conceded.
He effectively ruled out the possibility of a European central bank emerging
from its EMI embryo by 1997, and refused to speculate on the next target
date, 1999. But he could not ultimately imagine the EU, already heavily
integrated, functioning properly without a common currency.
Half-promising the EMI would move to its new home, Frankfurt, in September,
he whizzed off to his Basle base, leaving the assembled media without
champagne, sandwiches or ceremony.

FT  12 JAN 94 / Concern over pay levels in E Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Russia's minimum wage, of about Dollars 7 a month, has fallen to just 20 per
cent of the income needed for 'physiological survival', and minimum wage
levels are little better throughout eastern Europe, according to a report
published today by the International Labour Organisation.
The ILO's eastern European team in Budapest argues that minimum wages have
fallen so far behind both average wages and subsistence levels that they
have ceased to function as a form of protection against poverty.
Mr Guy Standing, director of the ILO team, says that because minimum wages
are the basis for welfare benefits, governments have held them down as a
means of controlling expenditure.
In Ukraine the minimum wage is even lower than in Russia, in Bulgaria the
minimum wage is about 60 per cent of the subsistence level, in Albania it is
24 per cent, in Romania less than 50 per cent, in Estonia 61 per cent, in
Hungary 64 per cent, and Poland 70 per cent.
'When unemployment or disability benefits are held to less than Dollars 10 a
month because the authorities set those benefits at the minimum wage level,
they do not even give enough to pay for bread and milk,' says Mr Standing.
'The formal link between transfer payments (from governments to individuals)
and the minimum wage must be severed.'
The minimum wage has also fallen sharply in relation to average wages, which
have themselves been falling rapidly. In 1993, wages in Russia grew by 12
per cent, but after falls of 45 per cent, 38 per cent and 60 per cent in
1990, 1991 and 1992 respectively. Hungary has had the lowest fall, with
wages stable in 1990, falling 6 per cent in 1991, 3 per cent in 1992 and
another 3 per cent in 1993.
The decline in the minimum wage has also led to a large increase in
inequality. 'The most notable change has been the declining position of
those working in government organisations where wage scales have been
rigidly based on the minimum wage,' according to Mr Daniel
Vaughan-Whitehead, one of the co-authors.
He said that people are surviving because they have second jobs in the black
market, because they also receive payment in kind and because they have
independent sources of food.

Bulgaria and its London Club commercial bank creditors yesterday began
detailed discussion in Frankfurt of last November's outline agreement for a
50 per cent reduction in its Dollars 9.3bn (Pounds 6.28bn) debt to a group
of more than 300 commercial creditor banks led by Deutsche Bank.
Previous talks had reached deadlock with Bulgaria seeking a 70 per cent
discount while the banks offered only 38 per cent. The talks take place
against renewed weakness for the Bulgarian currency, with the lev losing
nearly 10 per cent of its value against the dollar in recent trading.
Mr Stoyan Alexandrov, finance minister, who heads the Bulgarian delegation,
said a final agreement might not be signed earlier than the middle of this
year. A deal depends not only on reaching agreement on technical details
with the banks but on a new standby agreement with the International
Monetary Fund.
Bulgaria has had to rely on financing from the IMF, the World Bank and
foreign aid since 1990 when the socialist government stopped first interest
and then capital repayments on the foreign debt.
IMF officials visited Sofia last month; they said they wanted to see a
budget deficit ceiling of 6.2 per cent of GDP before moving ahead with a new
standby arrangement and a Dollars 300m special loan for countries in
transition. Parliament re-opens today when debate on the 1994 budget will
begin.

FT  12 JAN 94 / Clinton in Europe: Eastern Europe caught up in new arms race
 -Defence fears and potential profits in the weapons trade have forced
states to change track
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Central European leaders meet President Bill Clinton today aware that in
future they will have to pay more attention to their own defence. This
conviction had been growing long before the rise of Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky
underlined the potential risk from Russian nationalism.
The initial revulsion against the arms trade from the idealistic former
dissidents who formed the first post-communist governments did not last
long. It gave way to a more sombre reassessment of future military
requirements and a more aggressive approach to selling arms on world
markets. What remains is a deep reluctance to jeopardise economic reforms by
diverting funds from hard-pressed budgets to the military.
Strapped for cash, several of the former Warsaw pact states have been
quietly turning to Russia to update their arsenals, taking advantage of
Moscow's willingness to supply arms in return for writing off rouble credits
left over from the old days of state trading.
The Hungarian army, for example, was always kept small and poorly equipped
by Moscow after it sided with 'counter-revolutionaries' during the 1956
Budapest uprising. But the war in neighbouring Yugoslavia and a resurgence
of anti-Hungarian sentiment in Slovakia and Romania, two other neighbours
with large ethnic Hungarian minorities, caused Budapest to take a fresh look
at its armed forces two years ago.
Russian President Boris Yeltsin, on a visit to Hungary, offered to supply
modern Mig-29 fighters, spare parts and equipment worth Dollars 800m (Pounds
540.5m) in partial repayment of Russia's Dollars 2bn accumulated trade debt
with Hungary. The Hungarian government agreed. It wanted to deter repeated
breaches of Hungarian airspace by Yugoslav air force jets making
intimidatory flights over Croatian villages across the Danube. Further
negotiations are taking place between Budapest and Moscow over the possible
acquisition of sophisticated surface-to-air missiles.
Shortly after the original Russian aircraft deal, the German government
donated spare parts and equipment from the vast stockpile of military
equipment inherited from the former east German army.
To allay the fears of sensitive neighbours, Budapest announced it was
destroying 510 older tanks to fulfil its obligations under the Conventional
Forces in Europe (CFE) agreements which led to the scrapping of thousands of
tanks and other arms throughout the region. But this did not mollify Mr
Vladimir Meciar, the Slovak leader, who arranged a matching MiGs for credit
write-off deal with Moscow last autumn.
Hungary's decision to upgrade its military equipment drew attention to the
non-Russian factors conspiring to make governments and arms producers
reassess their military thinking throughout the former Soviet bloc.
The clearest turnabout is apparent in both sides of former Czechoslovakia.
The moral revulsion of the leaders of the 1989 'velvet revolution' against
communist Czechoslovakia's role as an arms manufacturer and exporter led to
a virtual embargo on arms exports. But this had a devastating effect on arms
factories and related heavy industries located mainly in Slovakia and became
a big element in the divorce between the two states last year.
Czech and Slovak arms exports dropped from a peak of CzKr27bn (Dollars 1bn)
in 1987 to only CzKr6bn in 1992 while arms companies from the west and other
former Warsaw pact states scooped up potential contracts.
Once Slovakia gained its independence, however, Mr Meciar made clear that
former federal restrictions on arms sales were no longer valid and the Czech
Republic has also been busy re-building a smaller but more competitive arms
industry, with industrial groups like Skoda Pilsen attracting western
partners to produce updated arms.
Poland, like the other former Soviet satellites, has retired hundreds of
Soviet-trained senior officers. It now faces a power struggle over political
control of the armed forces between President Lech Walesa and the new
left-of-centre government. It has also been discussing co-operation with
foreign companies, including Israel with its close military hardware links
with the US and South Africa. All the former Warsaw pact countries of
central Europe are operating new defence strategies which reduce the overall
level of forces and shift units away from the western deployment demanded in
the old days.
But progress is slow, largely because of the cost.
It is not that Poland sees an immediate military threat from the east,
although Warsaw is anxious to see the complete Russian military withdrawal
from Estonia and Latvia and remains nervous about the concentration of
former Soviet forces in Kaliningrad. This Russian port-city enclave on the
Baltic has an estimated 300,000 troops and their equipment withdrawn from
east Germany and awaiting repatriation. Kaliningrad has become one of the
great arms bazaars in a region awash with military equipment and demoralised
soldiers.
The most worrisome scenario remains the prospect of a destabilising wave of
economic refugees. This is not a problem which can be solved by military
means, but higher unemployment in the former Soviet states is inevitable if
the military-industrial complex is slimmed down. Ironically the prospect of
mass unemployment in the military industries may recede somewhat as the
military-industrial lobbies regain ground in post-election Russia, but Poles
fear this will tend to reinforce the political influence of hardliners who
remain unreconciled to the loss of the Baltic states and central Europe.

Ukraine's agreement to rid itself of nuclear weapons remained in doubt
yesterday as both government officials and opposition spokesmen in the
capital Kiev blew cold on the deal promoted as the centrepiece of the summit
between presidents Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin in Moscow tomorrow and
Friday.
Mr Yuri Sergeyev, the Ukrainian foreign ministry spokesman, said that 'the
form (of the agreement) has not yet been fully worked out'. A document other
than a formal agreement could be signed at the ceremony planned in Moscow on
Friday between the US and Russian leaders and the Ukrainian president, Mr
Leonid Kravchuk.
Mr Vyacheslav Chornovil, leader of the opposition nationalist Rukh party,
told the Interfax-Ukraine news agency that 'president Kravchuk has no
authority to sign such an agreement. Nuclear policy is for parliament to
work out'. Both parliament and the president are up for election this year -
the legislature in March and Mr Kravchuk in June. Fears of Russian
expansionism, as well as nationalist demands that Ukraine remain a nuclear
power, have invalidated pledges Mr Kravchuk has previously made.
Russian officials were also sceptical about the agreement being signed - or,
if signed, fulfilled. Mr Vladimir Lukin, the Russian ambassador to
Washington, said in Moscow that 'there is an agreement but there are several
difficult precedents' of such agreements breaking down.
The agreement in principle would see the 1,800 of Ukraine's nuclear warheads
returned to Russia over the next three years, in return for a complex and
extensive package negotiated by the US and finally agreed in Washington last
week by officials from all three countries.

FT  12 JAN 94 / Clinton in Europe: Clinton camp sees its man as winner /
Assessing the results of the US president's maiden voyage in Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER and JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Before the Nato conclave was even half over, Mr Warren Christopher, the US
secretary of state, declared: 'This has been President Clinton's summit.'
This is natural, and not only for US officials. All heads of government put
their distinctive stamps on summits, be they economic, military or regional.
Mr John Major's aides in Brussels were spinning his contributions for all
they were worth, at least in the hope of getting decent play on the front
pages back home.
Yet there seems to be a sense of satisfaction on the US side that Mr Bill
Clinton has performed as well as they believe he has on his maiden
presidential voyage to Europe, given all the heavily publicised anxieties
supposedly greeting him.
Three highlights, in their mind, stand out: first, the Sunday speech in
which Mr Clinton emphasised in the strongest terms US moral and practical
support for a Europe integrated economically, politically and militarily was
exclusively directed at his European audience and apparently well received.
Second, the Ukrainian nuclear agreement has been generally interpreted as a
'foreign policy triumph', of which Mr Clinton's first year saw too few. It
means he will not leave the former Soviet Union empty-handed, regardless of
what difficulties there are in his talks with President Boris Yeltsin in
Moscow, although officials in Kiev yesterday cautioned that its ratification
by parliament was no foregone conclusion.
Third, US officials really do believe that Mr Clinton dominated the Nato
summit itself, both in his exposition of the Partnership for Peace programme
of co-operation with eastern Europe, though this was a pre-cooked agreement,
and in avoiding a transatlantic rift over Bosnian policy.
On this, at least, there was independent verification. Mr Manfred Worner,
the Nato secretary general, with whom Mr Clinton seens to have struck up a
good relationship, said yesterday that 'everybody was impressed by the
strong leadership and personal conviction of the US president'. But a lot of
this back-slapping - the Americans call it log-rolling - is to be expected,
since members of the club tend not to knife each other in public. Of greater
interest is what may be said off-the-record, particularly by those on the
European side previously unfamiliar with Mr Clinton.
Senior Brussels officials were clearly impressed with Mr Clinton's energy,
intelligence and grasp of detail. The sense of a new generation of
leadership came across during a news conference at the European Commission
yesterday, in which the US president's fluency contrasted with a visibly
shaky Mr Andreas Papandreou, prime minister of Greece, which holds the EU
presidency, and an occasionally wordy Mr Jacques Delors, Commission
president. 'Clinton really can talk about the 21st century, these other
people simply won't be around,' said one observer.
The US president also appears to have charmed the French, perhaps at the
expense of ignoring the British. His Monday tete-a-tete with President
Francois Mitterrand and Mr Edouard Balladur, French prime minister, included
an improbable compliment about France's 'constructive co-operation' in
concluding a Gatt world trade agreement. More substantively, the US decision
to give explicit political recognition to an independent Europe-only defence
capability operating under the Nato umbrella signifies a strategic shift.
In contrast with the Bush administration, Mr Clinton appears much more
relaxed about allowing the West European Union to take on greater burdens
such as peacekeeping.
German and French officials said the US move marked a big step toward a
credible 'European pillar' in Nato and a recognition of the potential in the
Maastricht treaty's provisions for a common European foreign and security
policy.
There are three question marks. First, US efforts to redistribute the burden
of defence in Europe could easily be misinterpreted as disengagement.
Second, a distinct European 'defence identity' will amount to nothing if the
Europeans themselves cannot muster the political will to act, as the
divisions over the wisdom of future action in Bosnia once again showed this
week.
Third, and more broadly, it is unclear what the administration's call for
greater political, economic and military integration in Europe, including
Russia, means in practice. Mr Clinton spurned the chance, for example, of
creating parallel tracks for the east Europeans to enter Nato and the EU.
In fairness, Mr Clinton forestalled some objections by spelling out a
commitment to maintain 100,000 troops in Europecomed by the British and
Germans. Moreover, his reluctance to set out blueprints for European
integration matches the mood of uncertainty among Europeans themselves after
ratification of the Maastricht treaty.

Bosnian Serb leaders yesterday rejected a Nato call for the opening of the
airport in Tuzla, the biggest stronghold of the Moslem-led Bosnian
government outside the capital Sarajevo.
At the same time, however, Mr Nikola Koljevic, vice-president of the
self-styled Bosnian Serb state, said he expected that Serb forces would
comply with the Nato demand to allow the rotation of Canadian United Nations
troops stranded in Srebrenica, a Moslem enclave.
In a telephone interview, Mr Koljevic said: 'We have always rejected the
opening of the Tuzla airport,' adding that his government would refuse to
discuss the matter until an overall peace agreement was signed.
Bosnian Serb chiefs are against the opening of Tuzla airport, vital to the
survival of the government enclave inhabited by some 380,000 people, on the
grounds that their Moslem rivals would use the airfield to smuggle weapons.
Serb forces have blocked off multi-ethnic Tuzla, a key urban centre where
much of the industry is still intact, since the outbreak of war. Croat
troops have banned all commercial traffic to the city.
Privately, UN officials on the ground feared that the Nato communique would
fail to stop the conditions in the UN 'safe areas' from deteriorating. 'It
is just sabre-rattling,' said a seasoned UN worker.
Stressing the importance of air links, UN officials pointed out that the
airport in Sarajevo helped keep alive the city's 380,000 trapped
inhabitants. 'The Sarajevo airport on many occasions is the main route in,'
said Miss Lyndall Sachs, spokeswoman of the UN High Commissioner for
Refugees. She said the eastern enclave of Srebrenica had changed from 'a
living hell' to 'survivable' after it was designated last spring as one of
six UN 'safe areas'. Srebrenica, in the Drina valley, remains a symbol of
Moslem resistance against the onslaught in eastern Bosnia by Serb forces in
April 1992.

FT  12 JAN 94 / Clinton in Europe: Nato moves closer to Bosnian air strikes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nato leaders yesterday moved closer to using aircraft against Bosnian Serb
forces, threatening air strikes if obstacles to the UN in two Bosnian 'safe
areas' were not removed.
The threat to use US and allied air power in pursuit of specific objectives
came as the result of a joint French-British initiative adopted at the Nato
summit. Allied heads of government called on UN military authorities in
former Yugoslavia to draw up urgent plans to get fresh UN troops into the
Moslem enclave of Srebrenica and examine ways of opening the airport at
Tuzla for humanitarian relief.
The latest threat, designed to respond to increasing pressure on Nato to
take effective action in Bosnia, was added to a joint declaration by the 16
leaders at the end of their two-day meeting. The declaration said Nato was
determined to eliminate obstacles to the UN Protection Force (Unprofor) in
accomplishing its mandate. However, Mrs Tansu Ciller, the Turkish prime
minister, said she was disappointed that the threat did not amount to an
explicit ultimatum to the Bosnian Serbs.
US President Bill Clinton said he strongly supported the initiative.
However, according to French officials, the US pleaded with France before
the summit not to put action on the two Bosnian safe areas on to the agenda.
Mr Clinton, who warned the other allies during the meeting against making
empty threats, said Serb activities in either area 'could require the use of
Nato, including US, air power'.
Mr Manfred Worner, the Nato secretary-general, said there was 'a stronger
determination' to implement the threat of air attacks which allies issued
last August. The situation in Srebrenica, where a contingent of Dutch troops
is due to relieve 300 Canadians but are being blocked by Serb forces, was
described as 'intolerable' by Mr John Major, the British prime minister. 'It
is quite clear that if it is necessary to use air power to achieve (the
rotation of forces) then we would be prepared to use it,' he said.
President Francois Mitterrand of France said he expected Mr Boutros Boutros
Ghali, secretary- general of the UN, to approve the plan.
However, although all allies signed up to the new policy, Mr Clinton
admitted there were still divergences. 'Some of us, I think it's clear, were
stronger than others about the appropriateness of it,' he said.
Mr Jean Chretien, Canada's prime minister, said bombing was a last resort.
'We always said we are not enthusiastic about air strikes,' he said.
Earlier, Greece and Denmark also expressed reluctance about attacking the
Serbs. Mr Clinton said he had insisted on keeping Nato's earlier threat to
employ air power to help relieve the shelling of Sarajevo, the Bosnian
capital, but accepted that this was the subject of differences among the
allies, some of whom were worried about reprisals against their troops on
the ground.
But, with UN troops increasingly endangered, Nato was 'closer to real
unanimity', the president added.

The US and Britain were both determined that the Nato summit - the
alliance's first since 1991 - should not be dominated by Bosnia. But it was
Bosnia and the deal Washington was negotiating to get rid of nuclear weapons
in Ukraine that took the headlines.
If the substance of the meeting appeared less dramatic, it was because it
was all foretold, carefully prepared over several months to avoid surprises
and clashes. Apart from one addition hardening the threat of air strikes
against Bosnian Serb forces, there were no last-minute changes to the joint
declaration drafted in advance of the meeting.
It was a contrast to previous Nato meetings at which officials have spent
whole nights haggling over wording. No longer held together by a military
threat, Nato could not afford confrontation. Both the US, which proposed it,
and the European allies wanted it to renew their relationship.
The Europeans obtained from President Bill Clinton a strong commitment to
Nato and a promise to keep around 100,000 troops in Europe, a third of the
US presence in the cold war. The 16 leaders endorsed a gradualist policy
towards incorporating former communist countries of the Warsaw pact,
inviting them and other non-Nato nations in Europe to sign up to military
co-operation under the Partnership for Peace programme. They backed other US
proposals to involve Nato in dealing with new threats resulting from the
proliferation of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and to set up new
command arrangements to cope better with peacekeeping and other missions.
An aspect that attracted less attention was the unprecedented emphasis given
to Europe's role in defence in line with the ambitions of the Maastricht
treaty. In the 26 paragraphs of the joint declaration issued at the end of
the two-day metting yesterday, the mystical catchphrase 'European security
and defence identity' is mentioned no fewer than seven times, 'the European
pillar of the alliance' five times, and the Western European Union, the body
destined to evolve as the EU's defence arm, eight times.
Washington has become a firm supporter of a stronger European role, to a
degree that may make British policymakers a little uncomfortable. The US,
traditionally suspicious of any threat to its leadership of Nato, is no
longer willing to provide the resources needed to hold the alliance up on
its own - thus the need for a more solid European pillar.
Mr Clinton recognised yesterday that the WEU would have an important role in
future, although Nato would remain 'the linchpin of mutual security'.
The planned new command structure for Combined Joint Task Forces, to be
built into existing Nato headquarters, is designed to create a bridge
between the two bodies.
It will include the French, who are not part of the alliance's military
organisation but have moved closer to the Nato mainstream in the field of
'peace support' activities, in which they provide the largest number of UN
troops.
The flexible command arrangements will enable the WEU to deploy task forces
in cases where Nato - or the US - does not want to participate.
Some European allies, however, are wary of giving the US an effective veto
on WEU operations. Any use of jointly-held Nato military assets would have
to be approved by all 16 allies.
The joint task force arrangements could also bring in non-Nato European
countries. Mr Clinton said the new structure would help to put the
Partnership for Peace programme into action by providing 'a vehicle for
eastern militaries to operate with Nato forces'.
Multinational troop formations already form the basis of Nato's post-cold
war troop structure in Europe, but it is questionable how usable they are
for deployments outside allied territory.
Mr Manfred Worner, the organisation's secretary general, said that the
allies had 'made Nato fit for acting'. The test for the alliance will now be
its ability to respond to demands beyond its borders, on missions that as
recently as five years ago would have been considered none of Nato's
business.

The first joint military manoeuvres between Nato countries and their
'partners for peace' in eastern Europe could take place as early as this
year, according to Mr Geza Jeszenszky, Hungary's foreign minister, write
Patrick Blum in Prague and Nicholas Denton in Budapest.
Mr Jeszenszky, speaking yesterday on the eve of east European leaders'
meeting with President Bill Clinton, said Budapest would welcome exercises
on Hungarian territory. After initial doubts, Hungary has taken a more
positive view of the Partnership for Peace and interpreted the initiative as
a route to full Nato membership. Partnership for Peace has brought to the
surface sharp differences between the four countries of the Visegrad group -
Poland, Hungary and the Czech and Slovak republics.
All four want to join Nato as a guarantee for their security which they feel
could be threatened by a resurgence of Russian expansionism, and as a means
of strengthening their own democracies.
But while Poland, Hungary and Slovakia wish to act as a group, the Czech
Republic believes it can achieve its aims more quickly on its own. Poland's
President Lech Walesa warned on Monday that Prague's approach could harm all
Visegrad countries.

expected fares for its passenger car shuttle service.
The fare for taking a car with driver and passengers through the tunnel
would range from a low of Pounds 125 for a special two day return to a high
of Pounds 310 for journeys at peak midsummer weekends. Cross channel fares
are considerably higher than most other short-sea routes worldwide.
The ferry companies, which had been fearing the outbreak of a price cutting
war on the Dover-Calais route, responded favourably to the fares
announcement. 'The size of the premium they are asking surprises even us,'
said Stena Sealink. 'If they are looking to building volumes they will have
to offer more attractive prices than this.'
The higher than expected fares prompted fears in the City that Eurotunnel
would not attract sufficient business to meet its traffic and revenue
projections. Its shares closed 17p lower at 608p while rival ferry company
P&amp;O closed 3p lower at 630p.
Sales of shuttle tickets, which start today, will be backed with a Pounds
25m pan-European marketing campaign advertising the simplicity of
Eurotunnel's fare structure. It has introduced four fare bands covering low,
high and mid-season with a peak rate for mid-summer weekends.
Travellers using the service will drive their cars into air-conditioned
wagons at Folkestone and remain with their vehicles for the 35 minute
journey through the tunnel to Calais. The total motorway to motorway time is
one hour, Eurotunnel said.
Shuttle journeys start on May 8 while through rail travel from London
Waterloo to Paris and Brussels for passengers without cars will begin in
June or July.
Announcing the fares, Mr Christopher Garnett, commercial director said the
Eurotunnel shuttle offered a unique service. Its benefits of speed,
frequency, reliability and ease of use, would be so compulsive that
customers would inevitably choose to travel by the shuttle.
Eurotunnel expects to carry 8m car passengers by 1996, about half of the
projected total cross channel market.

FT  12 JAN 94 / Maxwell liquidators recover Pounds 27m from Lehman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pension schemes formerly controlled by the late Mr Robert Maxwell, were
boosted by a further Pounds 27m when Lehman Brothers, the US-based
investment bank, yesterday returned disputed shares - the second such refund
of contested securities within the past week.
Last week, Bank of America agreed to return Pounds 25m to the Mirror Group
Newspapers Pension Scheme, settling a claim which had been the subject of a
writ.
The Lehman holdings, units in a Lazard Property Unit Trust and shares in the
Daily Telegraph, were part of a Pounds 100m writ filed against Lehman
Brothers last September by Robson Rhodes, liquidator of the
Maxwell-controlled fund manager, Bishopsgate Investment Management.
Lehman Brothers said it intended to defend its claim to the remaining Pounds
73m. However, it said it continued 'to support initiatives designed to
achieve an early resolution of the disputes surrounding the collapse of the
Maxwell empire'.
The shares were actually returned last November, but Lehman Brothers and
Robson Rhodes delayed announcing the development while both parties
discussed a possible settlement of the entire claim.
The refund was made after Robson Rhodes informed Lehman Brothers it would
seek a so-called summary judgment in respect of that portion of its writ.
'Our claim to these shares was so good it was not even a triable issue,'
said Mr Neil Cooper, partner at Robson Rhodes. Among other things, the
Lazard Property Unit Trust could only be owned by a tax-exempt entity such
as a pension scheme and Lehman Brothers could not legally have taken title
to them, the writ alleged.
Robson Rhodes has been seeking return of the securities from Lehman Brothers
since December 1991, and has in the past accused Lehman Brothers of trying
to obstruct its efforts to trace assets claimed by pensioners.
Yesterday, Lehman Brothers said: 'Having satisfied ourselves of the facts of
the claim and that the securities belong to the Common Investment Fund (of
the Maxwell pension schemes) and not to any other party, we were very
pleased to make this move.'
Meanwhile, Sir Peter Webster, appointed as a government mediator to seek a
'global solution' to the myriad claims by the pension schemes against banks,
insurance companies and advisers, is said to be making progress.
Mr Frank Field, chairman of the Parliamentary Select Committee on Social
Security, which has held extensive hearings on the Maxwell pension scandal,
said the recent refunds to the schemes are a good sign.

FT  12 JAN 94 / PM stands by 'back to basics': Major pressed to regain grip
on government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major faced intense pressure last night to regain a grip on the
government as senior ministers acknowledged that the recent spate of
scandals had delivered a serious blow to his political authority.
The prime minister insisted that the revelations about the private lives of
ministers and Tory MPs would not derail the 'back to basics' initiative he
has put at the heart of his domestic policy agenda.
He dismissed suggestions that the government was engulfed in a crisis of its
own making, describing recent events as no more than a 'little flurry'.
Speaking in Brussels before his return from the Nato summit, he emphasised
that the government's call for a return to traditional values was not an
excuse for a witch-hunt against ministers guilty of private indiscretion.
But the return of MPs to Westminster after the Christmas break brought
charges from the Tory backbenchers that Mr Major had failed to act
decisively to end the row provoked by the resignations of three junior
members of the government.
The first opinion poll since the furore began showed the Conservatives 24
points behind Labour. The poll, produced by ICM for The Guardian, put Labour
at 50 per cent (47 per cent in December), the Conservatives at 26 per cent
(unchanged) and the Liberal Democrats at 20 per cent (23 per cent).
The media focus on the marital difficulties preceding the apparent suicide
of Lady Caithness, the wife of Lord Caithness, who resigned at the weekend
as a transport minister, added to the air of crisis.
Senior ministers predicted that, barring further damaging revelations or
resignations, the present storm would 'blow itself out' over the next few
days.
But there was little attempt to deny that Mr Major personally and the
government generally had been badly damaged.
The discordant notes struck by different ministers over the extent to which
the 'back to basics' campaign had a moral dimension had underlined the
diminished authority of the prime minister's office. Colleagues will urge Mr
Major to set a more coherent framework after discussing the issue at
tomorrow's cabinet meeting.
Some ministers called for a wholesale shake-up of Mr Major's Downing Street
advisers. But suggestions that the prime minister might be forced into an
early cabinet reshuffle were dismissed.
Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, accused the Conservatives of operating a
system with one set of rules for ministers and another for the voters.
But Mr Major said the 'back to basics' policy appealed 'to the basic
instincts of an overwhelming majority of people in the UK'. He was confident
that the initial warm public response to the policy would be maintained.
The core of the policy lay in reforms such as the Criminal Justice Bill,
proposed changes in education and alteration of the adoption laws. It was a
campaign to 'get back to good, basic, solid common sense', he said.
'What it is not about is a witch hunt against individual transgressions,' he
added. 'It is not our job as politicians to preach about values.'
That view, however, is not shared by a number of prominent ministers on the
right of the Tory party who continued to insist yesterday that personal
behaviour could not be ignored.
Many senior ministers believe the best immediate strategy would be for Mr
Major to order a period of 'quiet reflection'.

FT  12 JAN 94 / Dublin to lift TV ban on Sinn Fein
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Irish government is to lift its broadcasting ban on Sinn Fein from
January 19, when the present banning order expires, allowing leaders of the
political wing of the IRA to be interviewed on Irish TV and radio for the
first time in almost two decades.
Downing Street responded coolly to yesterday's move, saying it 'noted' the
decision, which was a matter entirely for the Irish government. It said a
review of Britain's broadcasting ban would not be completed for 'some
weeks'.
Explaining Dublin's decision, Mr Michael D. Higgins, minister for
broadcasting, called the ban 'an appallingly blunt instrument . . . which
removed broadcasters' discretion and authority'.
He said the onus would now be on the independent broadcasting authorities to
prevent views being aired which would incite crime or violence, and which
could be sanctioned under other provisions of the Republic's broadcasting
legislation or criminal legislation.
'The Irish people abhor violence and those who support violence should be
submitted to critical questioning like everyone else. Cloaking them is
against the public interest,' Mr Higgins said.
The minister said that a review of the ban had been under way for more than
a year, before the present Anglo-Irish peace initiative. He said the lifting
of the ban was made for 'broadcasting reasons and not as some kind of sop to
Sinn Fein', although he said current efforts to persuade the IRA to abandon
violence and bring Sinn Fein to the negotiating table provided 'a very
important context' to the decision.
'The atmosphere is very different to when the ban was first introduced (in
1976),' he said.
Mr Joe Mulholland, director of news for the state TV and radio station RTE,
said the decision was 'a step forward'. Mr Gerry Adams, the president of
Sinn Fein, also welcomed the decision, saying it 'was long overdue'.
Labour welcomed the move and said the British ban should be lifted 'as soon
as possible without prejudice to the recent Anglo-Irish declaration'. But Ms
Mo Mowlam, shadow heritage secretary, said she was 'reticent to call for it
to be lifted today'.
Mr Michael Mates, former Northern Ireland minister, said he hoped the
British ban would not be lifted 'unless and until' the IRA ended its armed
campaign. Three policemen were injured in a bomb attack on their Land Rover
in east Belfast last night.

FT  12 JAN 94 / Pound hits six-month high against the D-Mark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sterling touched its highest level for six months against the D-Mark
yesterday as the German currency weakened and investors bought pounds in the
expectation that the UK will decide against an early cut in interest rates.
Ahead of today's monthly monetary meeting between Mr Kenneth Clarke, the
chancellor, and Mr Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England, the
pound rose to DM2.5981 in London and threatened to break through the key
market barrier of DM2.60. In New York it closed at DM2.5925.
While growing evidence of a strengthening consumer-led recovery and fears of
increased factory prices have damped expectations of an early interest rate
cut, some foreign exchange dealers reason that the UK will have to act if
the pound strengthens much beyond DM2.60.
The pound later slipped in London to DM2.5944, up from Monday's close of
DM2.5883. Against the dollar it eased to Dollars 1.4913 from Dollars 1.4955.
But its recent strong performance prompted some exchange dealers to
speculate that lower interest rates are still on the UK policy agenda.

FT  11 JAN 94 / International Company News: Deinhard sells brand
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Tropicana Products, Seagram's fruit juice business, has acquired Hitchcock,
Germany's leading premium fruit juice brand, from Deinhard, the family-owned
wine company. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.
Mr Manfred Scherer, Deinhard executive vice-president, said yesterday that
the sale was a logical consequence of the company's long-term strategy of
focusing on its core wine business.
However, Deinhard will continue to distribute the brand in Germany.
Mr Myron Roeder, Tropicana's president, said that Hitchcock, a pure fruit
juice, was 'a perfect match for our own portfolio of premium juices' and was
an important step towards building a significant and profitable business.
Germany's annual consumption of fruit juice, at almost 40 litres a head, is
the highest in the world but more than 97 per cent of available products are
made from concentrate.

FT  11 JAN 94 / International Company News: Unions fear job cuts at Elf unit

<TEXT>
Elf-Atochem, the chemicals arm of Elf-Aquitaine, the French oil group which
is due to be privatised within the next few weeks, is planning to cut about
400 jobs over the next two years, the company's unions said yesterday.
The cuts will affect the company's French operations, which employ 21,600.
They will be achieved through voluntary redundancies and by shifting
employment between the group's production sites. The plan is due to be
officially approved later this month.
According to the unions at Elf-Atochem, the sites which will be affected
include Vendin and Lens, in northern France.
Production of polyethylene at Lillebonne, near Le Havre, is expected to be
transferred to Carling in eastern France.
The job cuts are part of Elf-Atochem's plans to adapt to the depressed
European chemicals market, which is undergoing its sharpest downturn since
the second world war.
However, industry analysts in Paris said that prices and demand were
beginning to stabilise and that a series of restructuring measures at
Elf-Atochem should enable the group to break even this year.
Union representatives criticised the planned job cuts. 'They will hit areas
which are already depressed and are unnecessary because Elf-Aquitaine
remains in profit,' said the Confederation Generale du Travail, the
communist-led union group.

Neste of Finland, and Statoil of Norway, struggling to cope with worldwide
overcapacity in plastics manufacture, yesterday signed an agreement to merge
their petrochemical and polyolefin industries.
The merger by the two state-owned groups creates a new company called
Borealis, which is one of the largest petrochemical groups in Europe. There
will be cuts in overlapping parts of sales, marketing, administration and
research and development.
Neste's Mr Juha Rantanen, who becomes chief executive of Copenhagen-based
Borealis, said he did not plan to close any of the company's plants.
Assets in Borealis, which will be owned 50-50 by Neste and Statoil, will be
about DM4bn (Dollars 2bn), and equity capital in the opening balance sheet
will be about 40 per cent of assets, said Statoil's chief executive, Mr
Harald Norvik. Borealis' annual turnover will also be about DM4bn.

FT  11 JAN 94 / Nato Summit: Worner call to avoid dividing Europe anew
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Opening the Nato summit, Mr Manfred Worner, secretary general, set out five
'tremendous challenges' for the alliance. The following are extracts:
'First, the transatlantic relationship and its importance have to be
reaffirmed. Our support for the European security and defence identity must
be equally clear and firm.
'Transatlantic solidarity and European integration are not alternatives, let
alone contradictions. Europe must gain in unity and strength, in order to
assume its share of responsibility in our alliance.
'This is as much in the interest of the alliance as of North America and of
Europe. Nato reform and European integration have to be seen in connection
to each other. . .
'Second, in order to stabilise the whole of Europe we have to give a new
quality to the co-operation with our partners. The initiative Partnership
for Peace does exactly this. . .
'We will not allow anyone or anything to manoeuvre our alliance into a false
alternative: to have to choose between Russia and the other co-operation
partners.
'Our message to Russia has been consistent and clear ever since, after our
summit in London, you sent me to Moscow to extend the hand of friendship:
'Yes' to an ever closer partnership with a democratic and reformist Russia -
'No' to any revival of expansionism. . .
'Our message to the new democracies of central and eastern Europe has been
equally consistent: We shall not leave you alone. We care about your
security, which is of direct and material concern to us. And when we extend
membership of Nato to new democracies of central and eastern Europe, it will
be to help stabilise Europe and not to divide it again.
'Third, we have to improve our alliance's crisis management and peacekeeping
capabilities. In particular, we should be ready to use Nato as the forum for
achieving concerted views early in a crisis. . .
'Fourth, we have to adapt our structures to allow Nato to fulfil its new
missions. A significant level of American forces permanently based in Europe
will remain an indispensable component of our common security. . . At the
same time, alliance structures must be developed in such a way as to enable
the forces of European allies to operate under Western European Union
auspices, if need be. However, more flexible structures will serve our
purpose only. . . if we maintain an adequate level of well trained and well
equipped armed forces backed up by adequate resources.
'Fifth, we have to prepare for the new security risks, particularly from
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Non-proliferation is and I
think will remain our priority, but it may not suffice. So we have to look
also at the appropriate means of protection of our member nations and
citizens.'

<TEXT>
Vallourec, a French steel tubing company, promised last night to redouble
efforts to persuade the European Commission to approve a three-way joint
venture with German and Italian steelmakers, after rumours that Brussels was
poised to veto the deal.
The Commission is nearing the end of a four-month in-depth inquiry into the
joint venture to produce seamless, stainless steel tubes with subsidiaries
of Mannesman of Germany and Ilva of Italy. It should decide before the end
of this month.
Brussels officials refused to comment on reports yesterday that a three-year
merger task force had recommended to Mr Karel Van Miert, European
competition commissioner, the deal should be blocked. If the Commission
vetoes the joint venture it will be only the second time the EU's 1990
merger regulation has been used to ban a deal outright.
Mr Arnaud Leenhardt, Vallourec's chairman, said yesterday the reports of an
impending veto had come as 'a great surprise' to him and his partners in the
deal. 'There's a lot of competition in the areas where we operate, and the
venture would not do away with competition,' he said.
In November 1991, Sir Leon Brittan, then competition commissioner, persuaded
fellow commissioners to outlaw a Franco-Italian takeover of de Havilland,
the Canadian aircraft manufacturer, causing a political storm.

New car registrations in Italy, the world's fourth largest car market,

FT  11 JAN 94 / Clinton warns of threat to credibility
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US president Bill Clinton warned European allies yesterday that the North
Atlantic Treaty Organisation must be ready to carry out threats of military
action in Bosnia or risk the credibility of the alliance.
'If the situation does not improve, the alliance must be prepared to act,'
he said on the opening day of the Nato summit. However, he later made clear
there was no question of an immediate decision to launch air strikes.
He told other Nato leaders that threats of action 'cannot be seen as mere
rhetoric'. Those who attacked Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, must understand
that Nato was serious, he said.
Arguments over Bosnia threatened to undermine the image of renewed purpose
which Nato sought to project at the summit, primarily through the forging of
new links with former enemies in central and eastern Europe. Mr Clinton said
at a press conference that Nato's opening to the east, less than three years
after the disbandment of the Warsaw pact, was the real issue of the day.
The 16 leaders yesterday launched their Partnership for Peace project
inviting former Warsaw pact countries, including Russia and the rest of the
former Soviet Union, to negotiate military ties.
The plan is a compromise which holds out the prospect of eventual membership
for some former communist countries while acknowledging the opposition of
Russian hardliners who fear encirclement by Nato. Poland's president Lech
Walesa said the plan was 'a step that is too short but in the right
direction.' The alliance hopes eastern European partners will join in
taskforces for regional conflicts. The summit is also due to approve a new
command structure designed to help Nato deal more effectively with crises
such as Bosnia.
Last night allied leaders met for discussions in depth on Bosnia and the
possible use of air-strikes to halt the fighting between Serbs, Croats and
Moslems and ensure that UN troops carry out relief missions. But even before
the evening talks, divisions resurfaced among allies. Britain and Canada
expressed reservations about the risks of military action, including
possible reprisals against their troops serving with the UN.
Mr Andre Ouellet, Canadian foreign minister, told reporters: 'An air strike
might solve a minor circumstantial problem but could create a number of
other difficulties and make our troops be perceived as belligerents.'
Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign minister, said the threat of air strikes - which
was first made last year - 'might well be implemented'. But he warned that
any action would have to be carefully considered.
British officials have tried to avoid making the Bosnian conflict a
benchmark for Nato's credibility, but Mr Clinton's declaration was explicit.
'What is at stake is not just the safety of the people in Sarajevo and any
possibility of bringing this terrible conflict to an end, but the
credibility of the alliance itself,' he said.

Shares in tobacco and financial services group BAT Industries gave up 8 to
555p, in above average trade of 8.2m shares, after Hoare Govett reiterated
its negative stance. But the broker denied market talk that it had also
downgraded profit expectations.
Urging investors to sell the stock, Hoare said: 'Negative cash flow in 1994
and 1995 is likely to impede significant dividend progression.' Analysts at
SG Warburg were also reported to have advised investors to sell the stock.
The retreat came as the group announced it had merged its two UK based asset
management operations to form Threadneedle Asset Management.
Conglomerate Tomkins finished a net 3 lighter at 259p, having surrendered an
earlier gain that took it to the day's peak of 274p following the release of
better than expected first-half figures. Interim profits came in at Pounds
93.8m, around Pounds 5m ahead of forecasts, and analysts quickly moved to
make modest upgrades to their full year expectations.
However, researchers said the post-results meeting with management was
'unconvincing' and that doubts about the RHM acquisition remain. Volume had
reached 7.2m shares by the close.
Last week's strong showing by the leisure sector continued, although Rank
Organisation was sent into reverse by a combination of profit-taking and
nervousness ahead of results due on Thursday. The stock retreated from
Friday's all-time high to close 21 down at 1013p. Worries in the market over
Rank's full-year figures on Thursday particularly centred around the
contribution from the Rank Xerox division. Analysts are forecasting profits
of some Pounds 265m.
Lesiure and property group Ladbroke was again a feature as its run of
positive news continued. After last week's executive changes and flurry of
broker recommendations, the company yesterday unveiled its bid for the
National Lottery.
Analysts were also digesting weekend press reports of further restructuring
moves at the group and the possibility of a name change. The stockclimbed 6
to 200p in another hefty day's turnover of 17m shares.
Stakis rose 6 to 71p as Hoare Govett recommended the shares amid weekend
press reports that the hotel group would report profits in excess of Pounds
10m today. Hoare is looking for Pounds 10.8m and expects a confident trading
statement.
Jewellery retailer Signet Group soothed investor nerves with a positive
trading statement and the shares moved forward 3 1/2 to 31p. A month ago,
worries over pre-Christmas trading at the former Ratners chain pushed the
shares down to half their current level. Signet said December like-for-like
sales were 11 per cent higher than last year and forecast a return to
profitability for 1994, compared with a loss of Pounds 40.1m last year.
Among other stores groups expected to make trading statements this week,
Laura Ashley added 6 at 78p, while Storehouse dipped 5 to 242p. Speculation
that Kingfisher will still be pushed into commenting on its Christmas sales
continued, although the shares rebounded from last week's mauling to close 8
up at 737p. There was also talk that a securities house, believed to be
Smith New Court, had downgraded its profits forecast. Kingfisher, which owns
the Comet electrical retail chain, was undermined by a profits warning last
week from Dixons. The latter eased a penny to 243p.
Oil shares, among the market's best performers last week, were hit by a wave
of selling pressure as dealers adopted the view that an emergency meeting of
Opec members later this month is now unlikely. The latest stories were
accompanied by a steep decline in crude oil prices, which fell around 30
cents a barrel.
The next Opec meeting is scheduled for March 25. The influential Middle East
Economic Survey said such a meeting is unlikely.
BP slipped 4 1/2 to 368p in turnover of 6m shares, while Shell Transport
lost 3 1/2 to 739p on 2.9m. Burmah Castrol, a strong performer last week
after a broker recommendation, retreated 15 to 848p.
In the exploration and production sub-sector, Lasmo's recent strong rally
was halted, the shares receding 5 to 123p. Premier Consolidated attracted
heavy activity, most of which was accounted for by two trades, with one
institution thought to have sold a block of 4.6m shares at 21p apiece. A
block of 3m was said to have been sold on at 21 1/4 p a share.
TSB, with preliminary results scheduled for Thursday, put on 5 at 259p.
Hints that a US institution had sold a block of 200,000 Willis Corroon ADRs
into London, equivalent to 1m shares, saw Willis shares slip 4 1/2 to 238
1/2 p.

FT  11 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: RMC and Wolseley hit highs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The building materials sector provided two of the best performers in the
FT-SE 100 Index yesterday in Wolseley and RMC, both of which raced up to
all-time highs.
Wolseley, the builders merchant, took pride of place in the sector, the
shares climbing 25, or 2.9 per cent, to a record 895p as the market became
increasingly optimistic about the outcome of a visit by UK analysts to the
company's French interests, called Brossette, acquired in 1992.
Brossette is France's leading plumbing materials supplier and performed
exceptionally well last year in spite of the weak French economy, improving
both turnover and profits via gains in market share.
Analysts also focused on the exceptionally good figures for November
released by the Builders Merchants Federation last week. These showed an
11.3 per cent increase in real turnover levels, the 10th consecutive month
to show an upturn. And Wolseley shares featured in a basket of call warrants
issued by Morgan Stanley involving shares in four UK building companies.
Morgan Stanley (Jersey) issued 1m call warrants, with each basket containing
14 Tarmac shares, three Wolseley, 17 Taylor Woodrow and three RMC.
RMC shares moved through the symbolic Pounds 10 barrier for the first time,
closing 11 higher at 1002p, boosted partly by their involvement in the
Morgan Stanley basket, but also by general optimism on interest rates in
Europe, particularly in the UK and Germany.
Tarmac, however, settled 2 off at 192p, reacting to flurries of
profit-taking after its recent strong showing. Taylor Woodrow also came
under pressure, closing 5 cheaper at 159p, with one UK broker said to have
adopted a cautious stance on the shares.

FT  11 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An erratic and less confident performance from derivatives markets took its
toll of equities again yesterday, writes Terry Byland.
The March contract on the FT-SE 100 Index undermined the stock market at
first, when it failed to hold a premium of 15 to 20 points against cash, and
caused share prices to hurriedly abandon early gains.
The contract continued to drift down for much of the remainder of the
session, before rallying as Wall Steet opened in good form. At the day's
worst, the March contract was at a discount of several points against its
fair value premium, currently estimated at 13 points, unchanged from last
week. But by the close, a premium of 9 points to fair value had been
restored. Volume slipped below last week's levels to record 12,635 bargains.
Dealers pointed out that there had been no opportunity for the arbitrage
operations between futures and underlying stocks which enlivened both
markets last week. Yesterday, the locals, or independent traders, found
themselves left to trade amongst themselves. The big securities houses were
content to tidy up any outstanding trading situations positions but
uninterested in opening up new ones.
Business in traded options was reduced, the final total of 33,868 contracts
contrasting with nearly 55,000 on Friday. Volume in the Footsie contract
dipped to 9,136 from 13,717, while the Euro FT-SE contract returned 3,314.
Among individual contracts, Ladbroke, the leisure, bookmaking and hotels
group, topped the list with 3,297 as investors continued to reasses the
implications of the departure of the chairman.

FT  11 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Share prices end erratic session with
a rally - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A highly volatile, but finally unconvincing, session in London stocks saw
share prices consolidating around existing levels rather than developing any
new trends. Non-Footsie stocks again attracted significant interest
although, here again, the focus was on con-solidation.
Traders expressed concern over the volatility which has featured equities
since Christmas. Stock index futures led share prices yesterday but there
was no sign of specific pressures in the derivatives markets. Hopes for base
rate cuts appeared to have been put back to spring once more, and weakness
in government bonds took the bounce out of the stock market.
A strong start to the new Wall Street session gave a closing boost to a
London market which had moved through a near 40-point Footsie range earlier
in the day. Marketmakers were still struggling to attract stocks to
replenish their trading books.
At its final reading the FT-SE 100 Index was down 5.4 at 3,440.6. London
opened well, hoping for a continuation of Friday's advance, but was
undermined when the stock index futures refused to support the initial
optimism.
A gain of 22 Footsie points in pre-trading was quickly wiped off within a
few minutes of the opening of the derivatives markets. Shares then drifted
down and the Footsie showed a loss of 16 points as it waited for Wall Street
to open. The rally in London came slowly, as the Dow Industrial Average
gained 15 points in UK trading hours.
The FT-SE Mid 250 Index also gave ground, slipping 11.1 to 3,901.4. But
trading in non-Footsie stocks made up around 66 per cent of the day's Seaq
total of 849.1m shares, well above daily averages.
Stock exchange statistics disclosed that Friday's Seaq volume of 1.4bn
shares was worth Pounds 2.25bn in retail business, nearly twice the daily
average for last year. This bore out suggestions that the big institutions
have been busy reshaping their portfolios, often moving out of selected blue
chips and into second line issues. In an unusual development, last week saw
the FT-SE Mid 250 Index setting the pace for the blue chip sectors.
This has in part been prompted by the powerful influence exerted on the
Footsie stocks from the derivatives market, which has given rise to some
concern over the valuations put on the Footsie list by the pre-Christmas
boom.
The market was held back by the less buoyant mood in oil shares, as well as
by caution among some domestic sectors as they awaited the January round of
profits statements.
Uncertainty still hung over the retail sector as it looked for definitive
news from the Christmas sales. However, some analysts believe that any
weakness in retail sales might benefit the stock market by prompting the cut
in base rates on which a further advance in share prices appears to depend.
Some other consumer sectors ran into profit-takers and the banks, which
outperformed strongly in December, were mostly easier ahead of their trading
statements - the exception being TSB which opens the season later this week.
London's ready response to Wall Street was seen as a promising indication of
underlying confidence. Hopes that interest rates can remain low in the US
revived last week, contrasting with the bout of nervousness over the US
economy suffered in the previous week.

FT  11 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow climbs strongly to new
record
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
After a hesitant start, US share prices rocketed further into record
territory yesterday amid strong demand for cyclical stocks, writes Patrick
Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average scored yet another all-time high, finishing
44.74 stronger at 3,865.51. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500
also ended at a new record peak, adding 5.37 at 475.27, although the
American SE composite finished 0.71 off at 478.78. The Nasdaq composite
gained 3.75 at 786.69. New York SE trading volume totalled 319.5m shares.
Although the market stuttered at the opening bell, sending prices lower in
the first hour, the buying that pushed the leading indices to record highs
last week quickly materialised again.
By mid-morning the Dow and the S&amp;P were in positive territory, with demand
concentrated mostly on stocks sensitive to the economic cycle. Analysts
again attributed the buying, which picked up strongly in the afternoon, to
institutions putting to work the cash they received from investors in the
new year.
The money flows were sufficiently strong to offset yesterday's decline in
bond prices, which pushed long-term interest rates up to 6.23 per cent.
Among individual issues, automotive stocks were particularly strong as
investors anticipated continued demand for cars and trucks.
Chrysler appreciated Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 58 3/4 , Ford Motor put on
Dollars 2 3/4 at Dollars 67 1/4 and General Motors, aided by an analyst's
upgrade, added Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 59 1/4 . Other cyclicals that were
firmer included United Technologies, up Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 64,
International Paper, Dollars 1 ahead at Dollars 73 5/8 , and Alcoa, Dollars
1 7/8 higher at Dollars 74 1/8 .
The latest development in the bid battle for Paramount Communications - last
Friday's announced merger between Blockbuster and Viacom and their new,
revised offer for Paramount - left investors unimpressed.
Paramount fell Dollars 2 to Dollars 77 1/4 , Viacom 'B' shares dropped
Dollars 3 to Dollars 38, Blockbuster eased Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 28 and
QVC Network, which still has the highest bid on the table, shed Dollars 1
3/8 to Dollars 39 1/4 .
Canada
After Friday's pause, Toronto share prices resumed their recent advance with
a solid gain that moved the TSE 300 index to a record high, helped by a
strong bond market.
The Bank of Canada's key lending rate is expected to fall five to seven
basis points at its weekly setting today to below 4 per cent for the first
time since summer 1963.
The index ended 32.5 ahead at 4,453.2, while rises outnumbered declines by
459 to 354. Further heavy volume of 71.4m shares was recorded. The financial
services group led the way with a rise of 1.78 per cent.

FT  11 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets: Global investors move in to take
profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM COCHRANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Some of the world's favourite equity markets were shaken last week, the odd
laggard reviving as strategists switched allegiance, and investors took
profits after the record breaking end to last year.
Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore showed falls of 6.9, 5.9 and 2.5 per cent
respectively and, in Europe, Germany lost 2.1 per cent and Italy 4.1 per
cent in local currency terms, as measured by the FT-Actuaries World Indices.
The outstanding gain, in sheer size if not in percentage terms, was the 2.8
per cent in Japan.
In Asia, these falls have to be seen in perspective. Malaysia and Hong Kong
scored local currency gains of 133 and 120 per cent in 1993, and even
Singapore put up a rise of 69 per cent, so there was ample scope for
profit-taking.
Strategists, meanwhile, were incisive. After gains of 17.6 per cent in the
World Index, and 40 per cent in Europe ex the UK last year, Mr David Roche
of Morgan Stanley reduced his global and European model portfolio equity
weightings from 47 to 44, and from 45 to 43 per cent.
'For the first time in a year,' he said, 'we are now overweight in cash in
both portfolios . . . we continue to believe that markets are driven mainly
by liquidity and have now reached unsustainably optimistic levels.'
At Nomura, Mr Nicholas Knight took a three to six months look at Asian
markets and reversed last year's downgrading of Japan, increasing its weight
from 15 to 22 per cent via reductions in Australia, Canada and Hong Kong.
Europe, excluding the UK, was downgraded from 15 to 8 per cent by Mr Albert
Edwards of Kleinwort Benson, who also lifted the Japan allocation, from 30
to 42 per cent in this case. Mr Edwards thinks that US short term rates are
set to rise sharply, bringing to an end the rallies in global markets led by
US liquidity.
Last week, Italy saw more bad news about corruption and political
uncertainty ahead of the vote of confidence scheduled for tomorrow. However,
the country's economic performance has improved markedly over the past six
months and Mr James Cornish, European strategist at NatWest Securities, is
maintaining a watching brief on the market: 'If Italy had total political
stability, no corruption and no Mafia, it would certainly be a buy,' he said
yesterday.

Mexican stock prices opened sharply weaker and extended their fall after the
weekend saw the Chiapas uprising spread into the Mexico City valley.
By the close the IPC index was down 165.92, or 6.32 per cent, to 2,459.11,
the biggest one-day percentage fall since October 16, 1989, when the market
dropped 8.05 per cent.
Brazil, in contrast, saw a further rise of 3.9 per cent after a climb of 7.2
per cent on Friday, the latest gains coming in an extended rally based on
politico-economic hopes. The Bovespa index finished 1,899 higher at 49,539.

Nikkei as Hong Kong rebounds

<TEXT>
A surge of buying by overseas investors, prompted by increasing caution over
south-east Asian markets, pushed up share prices, and the Nikkei average
gained 1.8 per cent, its fourth consecutive rise, writes Emiko Terazono in
Tokyo.
The 225-issue index put on 319.43 at 18,443.44 and the Topix index of all
first section stocks added 20.27 at 1,501.29.
The Nikkei opened at the day's low of 18,186.52 and advanced on buying by
arbitrageurs and foreign investors, with the bulk of overseas orders coming
from Europe. The index hit a high of 18,567.06 in the early afternoon, but
later lost some ground on profit-taking by corporate investors.
Volume was 470m shares against 322m, as overseas buying countered increased
profit-taking ahead of March book closing. Rises overwhelmed falls by 947 to
124, with 93 issues unchanged. The ISE-Nikkei 50 index firmed 4.04 to
1,253.76.
In spite of the increase in selling by corporations and financial
institutions, Mr Yasuo Ueki of Nikko Securities said most corporate
investors, who are looking to take profits, particularly on banking stocks,
were willing to wait while share prices continued to rise.
Blue chip electronics and large-capital steel companies were targeted, with
Sony rising Y140 to Y1,560 and Sumitomo Electric gaining Y20 at Y1,410.
Hopes of increased government investment in telecommunication networks
supported telecom and cable and wire companies: Nippon Telegraph and
Telephone put on Y11,000 at Y798,000, Fujitsu Y2 at Y881 and Furukawa
Electric Y9 at Y626.
Comments by Mr Masayoshi Takemura, the chief cabinet secretary, of a
possible reduction of the landholding tax, encouraged buying of real estate
companies. Mitsui Fudosan rose Y50 to Y1,200 and Mitsubishi Estate Y27 to
Y974.
Some export-orientated stocks fell on profit-taking. NEC receded Y5 to Y957,
Nissan Motor Y8 to Y752 and Toyota Motor Y10 to Y1,840.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 427.12 to 20,278.28 in volume of 56.3m
shares. The index moved above the 20,000 level for the first time in two
months.
Roundup
It was a day of divergent trends as some of the region's markets resumed an
upward path following last week's falls. Pakistan and Jakarta were closed
for holidays.
HONG KONG was a case in point, staging a strong technical rebound to finish
sharply higher. The Hang Seng index gained 365.46, or 3.3 per cent, at
11,366.94, but was off the day's high of 11,421.80. Turnover contracted to
HKDollars 10.8bn from Friday's record HKDollars 15.2bn.
Brokers commented that the gains were seen across the board and there were
no evident signs of an exodus by overseas funds, in spite of last week's
recommendations by some Japanese and US analysts to reduce weightings.
BOMBAY continued where it left off on Friday as foreign funds increased
their presence. The BSE 30-share index added 139.89 or 3.8 per cent to
3,802.09.
Some brokers commented that optimism was being fuelled by hopes that the
government would accelerate economic liberalisation plans.
BANGKOK, however, added to Friday's falls and eased steadily during late
trading. The SET index closed off 30.15, or 1.9 per cent, at 1,545.28 in
turnover of Bt20bn.
Finance and securities shares were the big losers, with the sector down 7.6
per cent and accounting for 52 per cent of market turnover.
AUSTRALIA firmed on strong futures trading with the All Ordinaries index
ending 12.6 higher at 2198.6 having opened up 10.6 points. Turnover was
ADollars 497.5m.
Attention closely followed insurance companies that may have exposure to
property damaged by the bush fires in New South Wales. The Insurance Council
of Australia has provisionally reported that the fires could cost insurers
ADollars 100m.
SEOUL closed lower as the stock market stabilisation fund placed sell orders
worth Won60bn. The composite index shed 16.97 to 873.04.
SINGAPORE rebounded strongly in a technical reaction to three successive
days of falls last week.
The Straits Times Industrial index rose 57.96 to 2,424.36, but was off an
intra-day high of 2,426.56. Volume was 629.5m shares.
TAIWAN lost early gains on heavy profit-taking in the electronics and
financial sectors. The weighted index, which had seen an intra-day high of
6,560, finished down 31.32 at 6,343.83. Turnover was TDollars 141.6bn.
MANILA added to its losses following Philippine Long Distance Telephone's
further fall in New York on Friday.
The composite index shed 70.17 to 3,089.39 with PLDT down 90 pesos at 2,090
pesos.
KUALA LUMPUR recouped some of Friday's losses on a technical rebound, with
the composite index closing 16.02 higher at 1,206.75 after a high of
1,221.90.
NEW ZEALAND enjoyed a steady start to the week with the NZSE-40 capital
index finishing up 27.36 at 2,251.51, with most sectors showing good
advances.

FT  11 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses limited in response to
overseas advances
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Senior bourses offered a limited response to their counterparts' strength in
Asia, and America yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT hailed a return to the 1993 bull market as the DAX index rose
22.15 to 2,233.79, but share prices had the smell of speculation about them
and the index eased to 2,225.00 in the afternoon. Turnover eased from
DM10.8bn to DM9.4bn.
Commerzbank, with news of its rights issue and higher dividend digested,
rose another DM9 to DM391.50 on stories involving Swiss stakebuilding and
the bank's insurance subsidiary. There was more rights issue news from GEA,
the engineering group, which sweetened the pot with a forecast of higher
profits for 1994 and rose DM20 to DM625.
Metallgesellschaft recovered to an intraday high of DM238.90, but sank back
to DM220 in the last few minutes of floor trading, ahead of tomorrow's
meeting with its creditor banks.
Cars and construction were favoured. Volkswagen, which unveiled its updated
Beetle prototype at Detroit's North American International Auto Show, rose
DM9.30 to DM452.50; in construction, Hochtief, which forecast a higher
dividend, rose DM26 to DM1,276 but Holzmann did better, up DM39 at DM1,099.
PARIS took another step into record territory as the CAC-40 index rose 9.70
to 2,317.25. Turnover remained strong at FFr6.8bn.
Activity was strong in the automotive sector with both Michelin and Valeo
benefiting from rumours that they were planning separately to raise capital.
Valeo, the components manufacturer, closed up FFr13 at FFr1,429 before
denying the rumours after the close. Michelin was FFr3.00 stronger at
FFr229.10, and after the close announced a FFr3.5bn convertible bond issue.
Good performances were seen in Accor, up FFr21 at FFr661, and Canal Plus, up
FFr18 at FFr1,132, with some analysts suggesting that investors were looking
for recent underperformers.
MADRID traded higher ahead of today's press conference from the ousted
chairman of Banesto, Mr Mario Conde, the general index rising 2.52 to 328.03
in turnover of Pta33.6bn.
However, the Madrid bourse bulletin noted that Banesto, trading outside the
official market during its suspension, changed hands at Pta1,400 last week
against the last official price of Pta1,995; and the banking group's
insurance subsidiary, Union y Fenix, dropped Pta315 to Pta1,795 when it was
requoted yesterday.
ZURICH, after five record highs in succession, turned down late in the day,
the SMI index peaking at 3,058.8 before closing 27.0 lower at 3,015.9.
Roche certificates shed SFr85 to SFr6,405, although its 11 per cent rise in
1993 sales was in line with expectations. Analysts suggested profit-taking.
SMH finished SFr3.50 lower at SFr212 after selling by one small Zurich bank
had pushed the share to a low of SFr207, close to the key SFr205 key
resistance level. CS Holding was SFr11 lower at SFr717 as rumours returned
that it had an agreement to buy the stake in Commerzbank currently owned by
RWE, the German utility.
MILAN began badly on fresh political problems, but picked up as recent short
sellers returned to buy back positions. The Comit index finished 8.05 lower
at 588.85.
Some strong advances were recorded. Montedison added L27 or 3.1 per cent to
L904 and Ferruzzi put on L74 or 5.2 per cent to L1,505 as the companies
completed their rights issues.
Strong foreign demand emerged for Istituto Bancario San Paolo di Torino, the
big Turin bank, which took the shares L320 or 3.1 per cent higher to
L10,400.
AMSTERDAM was active in second line stocks as the broader market fell back
slightly on profit-taking, Royal Dutch, for example, losing Fl 1.10 to Fl
208.60. The AEX index closed a marginal 0.4 higher at 424.45, after touching
a day's high of 425.64.
Oce van der Grinten, the manufacturer of photocopiers, was one of the most
active issues, rising Fl 5.30 or 7.7 per cent to Fl 74.30 following
better-than-expected 1993 results after Friday's close of trading.
KNP BT, the paper and packaging group, put on 50 cents to Fl 50.00 on news
that it had sold that its 40 per cent stake in Ahrend, the supplier of
office furniture, down Fl 5.00 at Fl 138.00.
STOCKHOLM advanced on the stronger crown, hopes for key rate cuts and
positive budget signals and share prices hit their third consecutive
all-time high. The Affarsvarlden General index closed 18.9 higher at 1,493.9
with strong gains in banking, real estate and construction stocks.
HELSINKI was led higher by a 1.9 per cent gain in the forestry sector, the
Hex index rising another 25.9, or 1.5 per cent to 1,724.2, mainly on strong
domestic demand.
TEL AVIV saw profit-taking after a record high on Sunday, the Minshtanim
blue chip index losing 5.56, or 2.2 per cent to 251.26, with turnover at an
all-time high of Shk623m.
ISTANBUL closed at another record high with the composite index breaking
through the 25,000 level, adding 1,762.4 or 7.4 per cent to 25,447.17. Last
week the index gained 14.5 per cent with turnover averaging some TL3,000bn
each day.
Among the gainers, Eregli, the steel group, added TL600 to TL8,600.

FT  11 JAN 94 / Markets Report: Further rise for sterling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The pound increased its strength against the German and US currencies
yesterday. The move was partly a reflection of a weaker D - Mark, but the
latest batch of UK economic data confirmed that recovery was on course,
writes Peter John.
The data showed that net consumer credit was up Pounds 290m in November,
housing starts rose by 11 per cent in the three months to November compared
with the previous three, and the trade deficit with the rest of the world
almost halved in October to Pounds 578m.
The figures were good enough, according to many economists, to dampen the
possibility of another cut in base rates and thus preserve yields for
overseas holders of sterling. On the other hand, they were not strong enough
to increase optimism over the pace of recovery.
Sterling rose to a closing high of DM2.5880, up from an early low of
DM2.5755 and  1/2 pfennig firmer than Friday's finish. Against the dollar it
advanced to Dollars 1.4960 from a previous Dollars 1.4910.
The rise was fuelled by significant buying of sterling by US institutional
funds, which were encouraged by reports that rate cut prospects were fading.
Matched against a trade-weighted index of 16 leading currencies, the pound
rose to 82.5 per cent of its value in 1985, up from 82.3 per cent
previously. Its new level was the highest since October 1992, shortly after
the UK left the European exchange rate mechanism. Just before 'Black
Wednesday', the day that subsequently became redubbed by some as 'Golden
Wednesday' as it triggered a boom in the UK stock and bond mar-kets, the
sterling index stood at 90.9.
Ms Francoise Skelley, chart specialist with Credit Suisse, said: 'I would
expect sterling to test recent peaks of DM2.59 and also to achieve Dollars
1.50 against the dollar. Dollars 1.51 will be the big challenge but it looks
quite comfortable at these levels.'
However, Mr Tony Norfield, economist with ABN-Amro Bank, argues that the
market's dismissal of an early interest rate cut is misplaced and sterling
will become overpriced if it approaches Dollars 1.51. He anticipates the
pound falling back to Dollars 1.46 in the spring, especially if the US
Federal Reserve raises interest rates.
General belief that UK interest rates are not poised to fall from their
present 5.5 per cent soon was also reflected in the money markets, where the
short sterling contract for March slipped five basis points to 94.70.
Government bonds and the London stock market were also weak - both tend to
rise in anticipation of lower interest rates.
Meanwhile, Bank of England operations were relaxed, although the forecast
liquidity shortage of Pounds 1bn attracted little interest, with just under
Pounds 600m taken up by the close of official dealing. The central bank
provided Pounds 500m via Pounds 400m of band one bank bills at 5 3/8 per
cent and Pounds 100m of bills for resale to the market on February 1 at 5
13/32 per cent.
It also provided a further Pounds 38m at 5 3/8 per cent and Pounds 60m of
late unspecified assistance.
The dollar suffered from mixed perceptions after disappointing US employment
figures prompted heavy selling at the end of last week. Investors were
awaiting US production and price data later this week, and although dealers
said the prospect of encouraging figures was already priced into the
currency, it gained some ground against the Japanese yen, rising to Y112.20
from Y111.80. It finished in New York at Y112.25.
The US and Japanese currencies are both expected to attract interest in the
run-up to the latest round of bilateral trade talks later this week.
The foreign exchange market remained unconvinced by last week's monetary
firmness from the German Bundesbank. Many dealers expect the bank's
governing council to reduce its key discount and Lombard rates some time in
January and have continued to sell the D-Mark and buy sterling.
The D-Mark was weak against a number of currencies in early European dealing
but recovered towards the close.
Dealers took yesterday's Swedish budget proposals in their stride, having
gleaned much of the relevant information from a radio interview last week
given by Ms Anne Wibble, the finance minister. The statement was as upbeat
as expected and the krone moved forward again to end at SKr4.6990 per
D-Mark, up from SKr4.7120 previously.
The Italian lira was restrained by an impending vote of no confidence
hanging over the government and slipped to L983.40 to the D-Mark, down from
L977.90.
The Belgian franc was also hit by domestic worries, relating to political
scandal surrounding a 1988 army purchase of Italian helicopters. It was
quoted at BFr20.89 to the D - Mark, down from BFr20.78.
Concern over rising inflation drove the Russian rouble to a three-month low
of R1,274 to the dollar, from R1,259 last week, with dealers predicting
further falls this month. The previous low of R1,299 was on September 23,
just after President Boris Yeltsin dissolved the old parliament and called
December elections for a new legislature.
The Taiwan dollar hit a six-month high against the US dollar in fierce
trade, and in spite of central bank intervention which brought the currency
down from its intraday peak. It closed at TDollars 26.4710 against the US
currency, compared with TDollars 26.5490 previously.

FT  11 JAN 94 / Survey of West Bengal (6): City of night, city of joy -
Calcutta hopes to regain its lost grandeur
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SHIRAZ SIDHVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rudyard Kipling termed it the necropolis of 'dreadful night'. VS Naipaul,
the author and Rajiv Gandhi, the former Indian prime minister, declared the
city was dead or dying. Back in the 1950s, Time, the US magazine, dubbed it
the City of Pestilence. Calcutta-bashing has been an international
free-for-all for decades now, but the city has had its defenders as well.
Satyajit Ray, the renowned film-maker, was a proud son of Calcutta, and
Dominique Lapierre called it 'The City of Joy,' recognising the soul beneath
its deprivation and decay. And Calcutta is the home of Mother Teresa, who
has shone like a beacon of hope for the desperate. 'Calcutta is
much-maligned, but it is also deeply loved,' says Mrinal Sen, a noted
film-maker.
For the first-time visitor, it is difficult to ignore the dirt, decay and
abject poverty. Once the gateway to the east and the proud capital of
British India, Calcutta is today a byword for pollution and overcrowding.
The flight of industry in the mid-1960s after the militant Naxalite movement
reared its head, and the waves of refugees from bordering countries and
states have compounded the city's problems.
For most of the past 16 years, the Communist Party of India (Marxist)
government has concentrated on the betterment of rural West Bengal, while
neglecting Calcutta. Power cuts have been incessant, telephones never
worked, and traversing Calcutta's overcrowded potholed roads could be a
nightmare.
But the last two years have seen the end of the power shortage, and the
telephone service has improved. The city boasts a second bridge - the
ultra-modern Vidyasagar Setu - over the River Hooghly, and a new metro that
has some claim to be among the best-maintained in the world.
Calcutta, which celebrated its tercentenary in 1989, epitomised the best and
the worst of British rule, and the colonial legacy is still plain to see.
Recently, Calcuttans protested loudly when their rusty, creaking tramcars
were to be phased out. The city's residents are justifiably proud of their
metro, but do not want to lose the archaic tramway. Stubbornly, they believe
that Calcutta will some day regain its lost grandeur and dignity. This is a
city of contradictions and paradox, and the roots of its split personality
are to be found in history.
In the mid-18th century, Robert Clive, the most celebrated of British
viceroys to India, described Calcutta as a 'city of palaces' but also talked
of the squalor of the surrounding 'native towns'. Two hundred years later,
the city has been unable to throw off the vestiges of the Raj - its
beautiful colonial buildings are grimy and crumbling, but they lend the city
their unmistakable grandeur, a grim reminder of better days.
Even after Delhi became the capital of the British Empire in India,
Calcutta, with its hinterland rich in tea, jute and coal, and over 80 per
cent of the country's industry, retained a pre-eminent position. The British
sahibs, executives in the big companies that survived partition, replaced
the bureaucrats - even today, the club culture is more evident here than in
any other Indian city.
Calcutta bore the brunt of the trauma of partition, with thousands of Hindu
refugees flooding in from east Pakistan. The influx recurred in the early
1970s with the formation of Bangladesh. Migrant labour poured in from Bihar
and other neighbouring states to take advantage of the opportunities
afforded by industry. Though migration from neighbouring states continues to
be high, the Left Front government's poverty alleviation programmes and
rural employment generation schemes have largely stemmed the influx from
within West Bengal.
With the downslide of industry, the flight of Calcutta's British
entrepreneurial base, and the lack of new investment, the city no longer
seemed able to contain poverty to its slums - it spilled onto the congested
thoroughfares, and make-shift dwellings sprang up on pavements and even
encroached onto the roads. Over 20 per cent of the city's 12m people, it is
estimated, now live in wretched and inhuman conditions, devoid of basic
civic amenities.
For its 300th birthday, the government promised a 'facelift' for the city,
but it amounted to no more than administering a 'Band-Aid for a terminal
illness,' as one critic has put it. A new auditorium, archives and a library
were built, and some 19 parks were cleaned up.
Executives say that colleagues from overseas still prefer to meet them in
Bombay or Delhi rather than risk a trip to Calcutta. Until a month ago,
there were no regular international flights, but British Airways and KLM
have just relaunched links to Calcutta, after a gap of several years.
Mr Jyoti Basu, the West Bengal chief minister, admitted to businessmen in
August last year that roads in Calcutta and the rest of West Bengal needed
urgent attention. The urban development department, he said, had initiated
several projects to solve these problems, but lack of funds continued to be
a problem.
In its memorandum to the Finance Commission, a central body which allocates
funds to the states, West Bengal's government urged it to grant extra funds.
'The Calcutta-Howrah metropolitan area should not be viewed only in terms of
West Bengal,' it said. 'Its eminence as one of the most important
industrial, commercial and exporting centres of the country transcends the
limits of the state and its contribution to the national economy should be
assessed on the basis of these considerations.'
The state government plans to ask large industrial houses to help rebuild
and maintain sections of Calcutta's roadways, which are in a dreadful
condition. Yet at the same time, it hopes to promote tourism, offering
financial incentives to those who invest in hotels, motels, luxury transport
and water sports facilities. Under one scheme, the government will lease out
nine British-style tourist lodges to the private sector for management, and
develop a new beach resort at Sankarpur, 180 kilometres from Calcutta. Other
schemes include the development of river sport resorts and a luxury liner on
the River Ganga, and a series of highway motels and roadside facilities.
The business houses realise they will have to pitch in if the city of
Calcutta is to be rejuvenated. In 1991, the Bengal Chamber of Commerce,
representing a cross-section of multinational and Indian business houses,
banks and trade, launched 'Pride and Glory', a son-et-lumiere show of
Calcutta's history. Within the sprawling white marble Victoria Memorial at
the city's heart, the show augments the Chamber's 'Calcutta I Care'
campaign.
Nevertheless, Calcutta is perhaps one of the world's most uninviting cities
for the foreign investor, and the state government is acutely conscious of
this as it strives to attract foreign investment. A publication of the
Bengal Chamber of Commerce admits that the ordeal may begin at Calcutta
airport, where the visitor is likely to 'get a shock  .. to be lost in
chaotic road and traffic conditions  .. he would be psychologically put off
immediately and decide to leave the city as quickly as possible.'

FT  11 JAN 94 / Survey of West Bengal (8): Power opens door to glory -
Profile: CESC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KUNAL BOSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In 1989, when Mr Rama Prasad Goenka, chairman of RPG Enterprises, India's
fourth largest business house, took over CESC, which supplies power to
Calcutta and surrounding areas, he promised that the city would not be hit
by power failures, writes Kunal Bose.
Today, no other big Indian city, except Bombay, can claim to be as well-off
as Calcutta is in terms of power availability. Mr Goenka says: 'The change
in the power scenario will bring about the economic regeneration of
Calcutta.'
According to Mr Sanjiv Goenka, the vice-chairman, 'we make constant
endeavours to get the most out of our existing power plants. In the past two
years, there has been an improvement of 25 per cent in CESC's power
generation. The average plant load factor for the CESC units is over 70 per
cent, against the national average of 57 per cent.'
But CESC also depends to a great extent on the state electricity board to
meet Calcutta's demand for power. The improvement in the working of these
two agencies in recent times has allowed CESC to draw adequate power from
them, enabling it to meet the demands of Calcutta's citizens.
Since the early 1970s the power crisis in the state hasdiscouraged
industrial investment. But the turnaround in the power situation has brought
Calcutta back in the reckoning of investors. Mr Sanjiv Goenka wants to
ensure that 'history does not repeat itself as far as power for Calcutta is
concerned. Power is neither fast food nor instant coffee. We at CESC are
working towards creating sufficient power generating capacity for the
future.'
CESC, which now has a total capacity of 580MW at four thermal stations, is
setting up a 500MW coal-fired power complex at Budge Budge, 25km from
Calcutta. The first unit of the complex will be commissioned in March 1996
and the second a year thereafter. Rolls-Royce Group will supply two 250 MW
turbine generators for the Budge Budge complex. The investment of Rs20bn in
the power complex 'is the biggest ever private sector investment in West
Bengal. The complex will go a long way to create the conditions for
industrial growth in the state,' says Mr RP Goenka.
Since the Goenka takeover, CESC has become an aggressive utility company. It
has also started preliminary work on another power complex at Balagarh which
will finally have a capacity of 1,500MW. But in the first phase the Balagarh
complex's capacity will be 500MW. The turnkey contract for the project is to
be given to Rolls-Royce with which CESC has a 'business relationship of more
than six decades'.
CESC is financially strong enough to raise resources from the Indian capital
market and banks and financial institutions from within and outside the
country to fund the two power complexes, says Mr Sanjiv Goenka. When the
Budge Budge complex and the first phase of Balagarh are commissioned, CESC
will not need to draw power from the outside agencies.
Besides creating new power capacity, CESC is making adequate investment to
strengthen its transmission and distribution system.
Asked how CESC would fare if a uniform national power tariff is introduced,
Mr Goenka says: 'We would stand to gain since our tariff is among the lowest
in the country. What I now want to do is to raise the CESC service to
consumers to an international level.'

FT  11 JAN 94 / Survey of West Bengal (7): Steel revival beset by doubts -
Kunal Bose asks if the state can reverse a sharp fall in exports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KUNAL BOSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The 35-year Durgapur Steel Plant, part of the government-owned Steel
Authority of India Limited, is preparing to give a lead in the revival of
West Bengal's steel industries.
According to Mr YP Sharma, managing director, when the modernisation of the
steel plant is completed at a cost of more than Rs40bn by the end of 1994,
'it will not only be making better quality steel at lower cost, but its
production will increase to 1.88m tonnes from 600,000 tonnes.'
Since nearly half that production will be in the form of billets - DSP now
makes only finished steel products - Mr Sharma expects a large number of new
units to be built in the state to convert the billets to rods and bars. It
is hoped that the investment in modernisation along with the improvement in
work practices will enable DSP, with an accumulated loss of Rs10bn, to start
earning profits.
In the meantime, DSP's nextdoor neighbour, Alloy Steels Plant has been
modernised in two phases and its capacity increased to 180,000 tonnes of
saleable special steel.
However, less than 50km away at Burnpur, the trade unions continue to put up
strong resistance to the federal government's move to privatise the Indian
Iron &amp; Steel Company which owns a 75-year-old steel plant. Even though the
government has decided to hand over IISCO to Mukand, a steel group with
headquarters in Bombay, which plans to invest Rs32bn no one knows exactly
when the privatisation will occur.
Earlier Mr Jyoti Basu, chief minister of West Bengal, wanted Mr Swraj Paul,
chairman of the UK based Caparo Group, to modernise IISCO. But he declined
after learning that he would not 'have a free hand in the management and the
government will have a role in choosing the new technology for IISCO'.
Whatever happens, the IISCO modernisation cannot be postponed any longer if
the plant is to be saved. The important thing for the government is to make
the unions understand this. The secondary steel units in the state which
produce the metal by using electric arc furnaces are having a tough time. Of
16 such units, with a combined capacity of about 300,000 tonnes, only four
are working.
'I don't see any chance of the steel making sector's revival in the
foreseeable future. The recession has made the secondary producers highly
uncompetitive. To make matters worse for the West Bengal based units, they
have to pay nearly Rs750 a tonne extra for the imported scrap as they are
far from the sea-based ports,' says Mr JP Chowdhury, president of the Indian
Chamber of Commerce.
However, fresh investment in steelmaking using the blast furnace route makes
sense. And there are quite a few such investment proposals in the pipeline
in West Bengal. Birla Technical Services has teamed up with a state
government undertaking to invest Rs3.5bn in setting up a 550,000 tonne
capacity pig iron plant. Century Industries, another Birla company, is to
build a pig iron factory in the state. The 90,000 tonne capacity pig iron
project of the Tatas at Kharagpur is to be commissioned shortly.
According to Mr Bidyut Ganguly, industries minister, the state government is
aware of a Rs6.5bn investment proposal for a steel plant with Lurgi
technology.
The improvement in infrastructure, particularly in the supply of power, has
made West Bengal an ideal location for setting up steel units. The state's
engineering industry, indeed, provides an interesting case study in
contradictions. On the one hand, there is IFB Industries, which exports the
major portion of its production of high precision fine blanked components to
European vehicle manufacturers; on the other hand, there are any number of
foundries which are either closed or sick. In the same group as IFB is
Modern Malleables, manufacturer of equipment and accessories for power
transmission and distribution systems, which earns nearly 90 per cent of its
revenue from exports.
In spite of the globalisation of business by a few engineering units, West
Bengal's share of the country's engineering exports declined to 16 per cent
in 1992 from about 67 per cent in 1966. According to Mr GD Shah, of the
Engineering Export Promotion Council, the reason for the sharp decline in
West Bengal's export share is that 'the state largely exports items like
sanitary castings.'
Nevertheless, the volume of engineering exports has improved of late.
'Rationalisation of cargo handling operation by Calcutta Port has helped,'
points out Mr Shah, himself a big exporter. Now that there has been a big
improvement in the supply of power, the West Bengal Industrial Development
Corporation expects that entrepreneurs from within and outside the state
will set up new engineering units to avail themselves of locally available
skills.
Electrosteel recently commissioned the country's first ductile iron pipe
manufacturing unit in West Bengal. Hindustan Motors, the country's second
largest car manufacturer, is to produce a new range of automotive components
at its Uttarpara factory, mainly for the export market.
But the state government does not know what to do with its many sick
engineering units. It does not have the resources to nurse them back to
health, but the federal government will not have anything to do with them.
However hard the state government tries, it will not find many takers for
the sick units. Most of them should be allowed to die a natural death.

FT  11 JAN 94 / Survey of West Bengal (9): Gas market's potential - BOC's
majority stake in Calcutta-based company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KUNAL BOSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The gradual opening up of the Indian economy and the fact that the market
for industrial gases in India is growing at a rate of 10 to 15 per cent
influenced the decision of BOC Group of the UK to raise its stake in IOL to
51 per cent from about 40 per cent early last year.
The remarkable turnaround since 1990 in the workings of IOL, whose
headquarters are in Calcutta, also encouraged BOC to take a majority holding
in the Indian company. IOL is not only the biggest and most cost-effective
producer of industrial and medical gases in the country, but it is also the
only gas company with a financial and technological tie-up with an
international company.
In view of the potential of the Indian market, it is quite likely that other
global gas companies will seek a foothold in India. Mr Shashi Shekhar
Prasad, managing director of IOL, is, however, not unduly worried about the
prospect. What gives the IOL management confidence to take on any future
competition is BOC Group's growing support in 'terms of management and
technology inputs to the Indian company'.
But before BOC made IOL into its subsidiary, Mr Prasad had to take a number
of major steps, including the hiving off of non-core businesses, to arrest
the decline in its fortunes. He believed that IOL should concentrate on its
core businesses: gases and health care products. This led the company to
dispose of its welding division to Esab. In the process, IOL's workforce was
reduced by nearly 1,600.
Mr Prasad realised early that if IOL was to do well in India's new business
environment, then it must become cost- effective. Today, at every level of
the organisation, there is a desire to control costs.
Like many Indian corporations, IOL was highly overmanned when Mr Prasad
became managing director in October 1989. But through the introduction of an
attractive voluntary retirement scheme and a constant dialogue with all
sections of employees, it has been possible to reduce the labour complement
from 3,900 to nearly 2,000.
'We could not have achieved so much unless the workers were convinced that
what we were doing was good for them, as also for the company. The
percentage of wage cost to sales was about 22 per cent in 1989. Today it is
about 12 per cent. Ideally, it should be 7 to 8 per cent. We still have a
long way to go,' says Mr Prasad.
From the beginning, the new management made a relentless drive to upgrade
gas-making technologies and modernise all IOL plants. The access to BOC
group technologies has been of great help.
As Mr Prasad says: 'The company is now using contemporary air separation
technology to make 65 per cent of the gases. We were at the zero level in
1987. My target is to make 100 per cent gases through that technology route
by 1997. We also have a lot of leeway to make up in cylinder filling and
distribution of gases.'
IOL, according to management sources, will need five to six years to catch
up with BOC standards. But already it offers its customers 'tailor-designed
new applications of gases, customised on-site gas plants and high purity
special gases.' As Mr Prasad sees it, demand from the Indian food, chemical
and electronics sectors for nitrogen will grow rapidly. IOL's easy access to
application technologies from BOC will prove advantageous.
The continuing modernisation of manufacturing facilities and rationalisation
of labour are well reflected in IOL's balance sheet. In the six months to
September 30, IOL's net profit of Rs40m nearly doubled over the
corresponding period of the previous year.
Mr Prasad thinks that it should be possible for IOL to invest Rs1bn every
two years in new projects. IOL will also be ready to set up gas plants as
joint ventures with the major gas users.

FT  11 JAN 94 / Survey of West Bengal (5): Packets may mean profits -
Darjeeling tea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KUNAL BOSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The billboard in front of the tea factory of Puttabong Tukvar estate in the
Darjeeling hills boldly proclaims: 'None before us'.
Mr SM Kumbat, vice- president, explains that tea growing in Darjeeling began
at Puttabong in 1852 with bushes brought from China. The 22km-long Puttabong
estate, starting at an altitude of 1,000 ft and ending at 7,000 ft, grows
some of the finest and more expensive teas in the world.
Last year Puttabong created a world trade sensation when it sold 120kg of
'antique tea' to a German buyer at Rs10,001 a kg. 'The entire quantity of
antique tea was hand-made. At no stage of plucking, withering, rolling and
drying of tea leaves were machines used. We unearthed the old records and
spoke to very old planters to find out exactly how tea was made here over a
century ago,' says Mr Kumbat.
Since then, Castleton, a tea estate owned by Goodricke, has sold some lines
of Darjeeling tea at even higher prices. 'Hand-made tea, which only a few
gardens produce, is targeted at the very famous and the very rich in Germany
and Japan.
This exclusive tea apart, the gardens at Darjeeling in general get fairly
good prices for the tea produced from March to June. Production during this
period, amounting to about 35 per cent of the hills' total output in a year,
is almost fully exported,' says Mr Mumtaz Ahmad, who represents the Indian
tea industry.
There is, however, a perceptible fall in the quality of tea produced between
July and November. It is because of this that the marketing of the major
portion of Darjeeling tea poses such a big challenge.
The disintegration of the Soviet Union, which was a big buyer of this late
Darjeeling tea, has made matters worse for the industry.
According to Mr Ahmad, domestic demand for Darjeeling tea is insignificant.
The industry fails to dispose of 65 per cent of its production at
remunerative prices. But Mr Ahmad believes its marketing problem can be
overcome if the region's major producers form a consortium to promote and
market Darjeeling tea - in packets - within India. 'It is not within the
capacity of any single producer to undertake this task. But once the
consortium has established itself in the country, it can start taking export
initiatives.'
Surprisingly, there are few takers of the consortium proposal within the
industry. No doubt, the world's finest tea is produced in the hills of
Darjeeling. The hill soil condition, high altitude and mist give Darjeeling
tea a 'muscatel' flavour.
However, the region's production of tea has been stagnating at around 13m
kg. And the cost of producing tea in Darjeeling is far higher than in the
plains of West Bengal and Assam. According to Mr SN Somani, president of Jay
Shree Tea, which owns three large tea estates in Darjeeling, the age of many
of the tea bushes, the difficult topography and low labour productivity are
responsible for the low yield of about 650kg of tea a hectare in the region,
compared with over 1,800kg a hectare at Dooars in West Bengal. Yet 'it would
be suicidal for the industry to chase quantity at the cost of quality since
quality happens to be the unique selling point of Darjeeling tea,' says Mr D
Atal, spokesman for the Darjeeling Planters Association.
There is an industry consensus that research must be encouraged if the
stagnation in Darjeeling's tea yield is to be broken.
The Indian Tea Board and DPA have jointly prepared a plan for upgrading the
Darjeeling Tea Research Centre. The industry will expect the DTRC to suggest
measures to arrest soil erosion, especially when old tea bushes are uprooted
to make room for replantation, and to develop high-yielding clones for
different altitudes of Darjeeling hills.
In spite of their ageing bushes, the Darjeeling tea estates are going about
the job of replantation slowly. They must first ensure that the uprooting of
tea bushes will not result in landslides, according to Mr Atal. If there is
to be any significant increase in the production of Darjeeling tea, then the
West Bengal government must allow the gardens to grow tea 'in their
contiguous areas which are now remaining unutilised.' The government must
also return land to the gardens which it earlier acquired from them as
surplus. Unfortunately, progress in this direction is slow.
Not very long ago, more than 40m kg of tea was marketed globally as
Darjeeling tea, even though production in Darjeeling hills would not be more
than 13m kg. All sorts of teas would be passed off as Darjeeling, giving the
tea a bad name. This menace has been stopped to a great extent, partly
because a Tea Board logo is now used only on packets containing Darjeeling
tea.

FT  11 JAN 94 / Survey of West Bengal (3): The nuances of protest - The
state's labour relations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SHIRAZ SIDHVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In Calcutta's crowded business district, traffic not infrequently comes to a
halt so that a protest march of workers can go by. After 16 years of Marxist
rule, it is not surprising that trade unions in West Bengal are more
powerful than their counterparts in other Indian states. A long history of
industrialisation and trade unionism has made West Bengal's workers more
aware of their rights yet, contrary to popular belief, more disciplined.
'Labour unions in West Bengal are professionally run, and fears that they
are more militant than in other states are imaginary,' says Mr AC Majumdar,
labour adviser to the Bengal Chamber of Commerce of Commerce and Industry.
'On the contrary, managers say they would rather deal with West Bengal
labour because they are more mature, and understand the nuances of
unionism.'
Mr Majumdar, who until recently was director, personnel, at Andrew Yule, a
Calcutta-based government undertaking, says that he managed 20,000 workmen
and saw no unrest in the 20 years he worked with the company. He points out
that labour, especially in the traditional engineering industry in the
state, is highly skilled, and adapts to new skills very quickly.
'The composition of industrial workers is also clearly defined here,' he
says. Workers usually have industry-wide settlements to determine wage
structures. In the engineering industry, most of the 400,000 employees work
for state concerns, and are not migratory, unlike the 300,000 workers each
in the tea and jute industries and the 100,000 workers in cotton. 'This
fosters a sense of belonging and responsibility to the state,' says Mr
Majumdar. 'They have coped well in the switchover from conventional to
modern industry.'
In a state where industrial decline has been the norm for nearly two
decades, the unions face a grim task in fighting plant closures, especially
of public sector undertakings that are declared sick by the central
government. The Delhi directive that there should be no new recruitment has
only added to the state's already heavy burden of unemployment. There are 5m
registered unemployed in the state, with 400,000 more unemployed being
registered each year.
Mr Shanti Ranjan Ghatak, West Bengal's labour minister, says that though
unions in the state have different ideologies, depending on which political
party they are affiliated to, they work as a united force to take up the
genuine grievances of workers.
The Left Front government is often called upon by the unions and employers
to intervene, and has successfully mediated in recent labour problems in the
jute industry, and at such large companies as Bata India and ITC's Tribeni
Tissues. Last year, the government's conciliatory machinery handled 8,365
disputes, solving 4,058 cases, 1,028 of them through conciliation alone.
The labour ministry has admonished industry for using lock-outs because of
financial or internal problems. 'The working class showed commendable
restraint, maturity and unity in the face of provocation,' a Department of
Labour report noted last year.
However, Mr Krishan Lal Chugh, chairman of ITC, an associate of BAT
Industries, says that the best strategy for the state government would be to
make a pro-business statement, instead of merely interpreting labour acts.
'What's good for business is good for labour' he says.
Commending the workers in the state for their high degree of discipline,
skill and intelligence, Mr Chugh says that the best agreements to resolve
labour disputes are ones that are linked to productivity. Tribeni Tissues, a
paper company which amalgamated with ITC in 1990, faced labour strife and a
lock-out for over three months before negotiating a satisfactory settlement,
with a productivity incentive plan at its core.
Mr RN Sen of IFB Industries, which manufactures washing machines in
technical collaboration with Siemens, the German engineering company, says
the attitude of labour in the state has changed, with the government as a
watchdog.
'The image that labour is full of strife in West Bengal was acquired with
the wave of militancy in the late 1960s and early 1970s,' says Mr JP
Chowdhary, managing director of Titagarh Steels and a staunch advocate of
industrial revival in the state. 'That image is changing, and what
distinguishes West Bengal labour is that once you sign a settlement, it is
honoured. There is no hit and miss with them, because labour unions have
evolved in this state.'
Mr Chowdhary says he is amazed by the degree of knowledge that most labour
leaders exhibit. 'I don't think there are many other places in the country
where you can hear a union leader discussing contributional analysis, or
optimum product mix planning,' he says.
The labour unions themselves are threatened by the government's new attitude
to liberalisation. 'We are not opposed to foreign investment in certain
areas,' explains Mr Chittabrata Majumdar, secretary of the Centre of Indian
Trade Unions, which is affiliated to the ruling Communist Party of India
(Marxist) and has a membership of 1.1m. 'But the core sector, like heavy
industry, steel and power generation must remain in the hands of the
government. The private sector is interested only in selling capital and
consumer goods, and their unchecked entry will ultimately destroy our
industrial sector.'
The unions are fighting to revive West Bengal's sick public sector
enterprises. They blame the state's rampant unemployment on the
unwillingness of the Delhi government to revive loss-making units. 'Opening
the floodgates to foreign companies is not the answer,' says the trade union
leader.

FT  11 JAN 94 / Survey of West Bengal (4): Havoc as crops fail - Jute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KUNAL BOSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Indian jute industry, which is concentrated in West Bengal, is having a
hard time because of the crop's failure in the 1993-94 season. Of the
country's 73 jute mills, as many as 59 are located in this eastern state and
they are finding it increasingly difficult to procure fibre, specially of
the superior grades, to maintain normal production.
Compared with last year, prices of raw jute have almost doubled. According
to industry officials, many of the financially weak jute mills - they
constitute the majority in the industry - will have to stop production as
the season advances.
In view of the short crop of 6.5m bales of 180kg each, against an annual
average of 8.5m bales, the federal government has allowed free import of
fibre in the current season. But little is coming from Bangladesh, as jute
prices there are even higher than in India.
In 1982-83 a short crop of 6m bales played havoc with the industry, leading
to a loss of market for jute goods both within and outside the country. Now,
officials say the government and non-government agencies concerned with jute
must formulate a strategy to bring about stability in the production of
fibre.
Jute products are already priced higher than synthetic substitutes. Any
further rise in prices would put the industry in a spot. Not only must there
be a greater degree of stability in the production of raw jute, but there
should also be a significant improvement in the quality of fibre.
A report prepared under the UN Development Programme-assisted national jute
development programme has warned that unless the share of the top three
grades of fibre is raised from 7 per cent to about 20 per cent of the total
crop by 1996-97, the mills will find it difficult to sustain their product
diversification programme.
Jute mills such as Champdany, Delta and Ludlow which have been steadily
increasing the production of export quality yarn and non-traditional high
value items including carpets, soil saving bags, decorative fabrics and wall
hangings are in good health, while units exclusively engaged in the
manufacture of traditional products such as sacking bags, hessian cloth and
carpet-backing cloth are mostly in the red.
According to Mr SS Kanoria, chairman of Ludlow, 'if the rest of the jute
industry in West Bengal is to do better, then they should follow the example
of the diversified mills,' which are modernising and upgrading their
production facilities. The prices of value added items are 'anything between
three and seven times those of traditional products.'
It does not speak well of the industry that in spite of the need for
diversification, the majority of the mills have been sticking to traditional
products. The high value non-traditional products had a negligible share of
5.78 per cent of the total production of 1.23m tonnes of jute goods.
However, nearly 70 per cent of the production of non-traditional items is
exported.
The UNDP-sponsored report says that 'the export market for value added
products continues to be large and it is likely to grow sharply.' The
production of such items can be raised to 300,000 tonnes by 1996-97,
representing about 18 per cent of the industry's total production provided
the mills make the necessary investment and change their marketing
strategies, according to the report.
Mr Sunil Jhunjhunwala, chairman of Delta, will not accept that jute is 'a
sunset industry. The diversified products have given a new lease of life to
quite a few mills. Of all the natural and synthetic fibres, jute is the
cheapest and it blends well with the other fibres. Jute fibre has the
strength and it also has a nice texture. In the future, many textile grade
products will be developed out of blended jute yarn.'
Mr Kanoria thinks that jute reinforced hardboard can replace timber. He is
confident that the UNDP project to determine if jute yarn can be blended
with cotton to make denim fabric will be a success. Jute, according to him,
will find many new industrial applications.
In the meantime, however, the federal government is no longer willing to
give protection to jute in spite of the fact that more than 4m families are
engaged in raw jute cultivation and over 200,000 people work in jute mills.
The official order saying that cement and fertiliser factories should pack a
certain percentage of their production in jute bags is still there, but it
is not enforced. Mr Jhunjhunwala says: 'We must accept the fact that certain
products like cement and fertiliser should ideally be packed in synthetic
bags and not in jute bags. The time is not far away when sugar will also be
packed in synthetic bags.'
Synthetic bags, he admits, are cheaper than jute bags and 'do not allow
seepage of materials. Market forces should decide whether a particular
product should be packed in jute or in any other material.'
With the gradual loss of segments of the domestic market, contraction in the
size of the industry is inevitable. And no one expects a spectacular
improvement in the export of traditional jute products. Except for a handful
of units, the jute mills have postponed modernisation and product
diversification for far too long.
The Belfast-based Lumus Mackie has promised to make available a new range of
high speed spinning and weaving machines. But before they invest in new
machines and technology, the jute mills want an assurance from the West
Bengal government that they will be allowed to 'rationalise the complement
of workers and link wages to productivity'.

FT  11 JAN 94 / Survey of West Bengal (2): Marxist warhorse puts out a
welcome mat - Jyoti Basu, the state's octogenarian chief minister, talks to
Kunal Bose
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jyoti Basu, West Bengal's octogenarian chief minister, acknowledges the
need for foreign investment in India. 'But such investment should be in the
priority sectors like power, heavy engineering, food processing and
electronics.
'Foreign investment must in the first place satisfy the condition of
mutuality of interest,' says Mr Basu who, during 16 years of uninterrupted
rule, has brought West Bengal back to the serious reckoning of investors.
Since the power sector was opened up to private investment, Mr Basu's
government has been talking to the British, German and Japanese 'to find out
to what extent we can work together.'
However, the chief minister is opposed to foreign investment in consumer
goods industries. 'I don't think we need Pepsi-Cola and Coca-Cola in India.
We must not get our priorities wrong.'
A veteran Marxist warhorse, Mr Basu nevertheless admits that for 'some
selfish reasons, I have welcomed the gradual delicensing of industries. When
there was licensing, the federal authorities used to discourage
entrepreneurs from setting up industries in West Bengal.
'I thought delicensing would put an end to all that. But even now, the
financial institutions, controlled by the federal government which provide
lines of credit to industries, do not look kindly at investment proposals
for West Bengal. We are trying to fight this.'
For several reasons industrial investment in the state should now pick up,
says Mr Basu. West Bengal's power situation is among the best in the country
and investments to create more power capacity should ensure that supply
remains adequate in future years. An Indian government report has confirmed
that the state's infrastructure is generally satisfactory.
Mr Basu mentions the Birlas, who are planning a significant investment in
steel in West Bengal. Also, the Tatas will in the near future commission a
pig iron plant. Among the multinationals, Philips and Siemens are fast
expanding their production base in West Bengal.
The chief minister's efforts to attract investment to West Bengal from
Indian businessmen living abroad have started to produce results. At his
invitation, Mr Swraj Paul, chairman of the UK based Caparo Group, is
examining the possibility of rehabilitating two engineering companies.
According to Mr Paul, 'though a Marxist, Mr Basu appears to be ready to go a
long way with the federal government so that West Bengal does not miss out
on new investments. The political stability, for which the credit almost
totally goes to Mr Basu, is a big plus point for the state.'
Mr Rama Prasad Goenka, chairman of CESC, which is setting up two coal-fired
power complexes in the state, says: 'The leadership of Mr Basu inspires
confidence among the business community. He alone can bring about West
Bengal's economic renaissance.'
The chief minister thinks that it works to the advantage of West Bengal that
the political parties (constituents of the Left Front) running the
government 'have some influence over the major trade unions. The political
parties use the link to educate the unions about the importance of
production and productivity. I think the workers in West Bengal in general
are a responsible lot. At the same time, I am aware of the complaints
relating to the lack of work culture. Maybe it is true in some cases. We are
trying to correct it.'
Mr Basu tells managers of private and public enterprises that they should
have 'a regular dialogue with the trade unions and workers on all relevant
company and industry related issues. They will certainly find the workers
responsive. It is only through a process of continuous education that the
workers can be made aware of their responsibility along with their rights. I
always tell the workers that they must study the state of their industries
before they put forward their demands.'
As for the privatisation of the 75-year-old sick steel company IISCO, Mr
Basu will not say more than that the Steel Authority of India, a central
government undertaking, 'can rehabilitate IISCO, if funds are made available
to it.' He does not believe that the solution to the widespread sickness in
the public sector lies in 'wholesale privatisation'.
But he is not against selective privatisation. 'We must keep it in view
that, as there are very good private sector managements, there are also very
bad ones. It will be wrong to believe that in the private sector alone, we
will find the panacea to the country's industrial ills. After all, India has
more than 250,000 sick private sector units.'
Mr Basu explains: 'The Marxists are running a Left Front government in West
Bengal. But we do not have a socialist programme. After all, we have to
function within the
Continued on next page
Marxist's welcome Continued from previous page
limits of the constitution. It is nothing like a separate republic of West
Bengal. We have a minimum programme for the people which we are trying to
implement effectively.'
He admits that 'the Left Front is in almost total disagreement with the
basic policies of the Narasimha Rao government. We are not at all satisfied
with the performance of the federal government. It does not have a
meaningful programme to increase the purchasing power of the people in the
countryside. Unemployment has assumed menacing proportions. India has ended
up as one of the biggest borrowers in the world.'
A relentless campaigner against communal forces, Mr Basu describes the
outcome of the recent elections in the four states - Madhya Pradesh, Uttar
Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh and Rajasthan - where the right-wing Bharatiya
Janata Party governments were sacked by the centre following the demolition
of the Babri Masjid at Ayodhya in December 1992 as a 'setback for the forces
of the right. But Congress (I) will be mistaken if it thinks that the
election results are an endorsement of its policies. People voted against
Congress (I) where there was a credible alternative to it. But when the
choice was between the Congress (I) and the BJP, they voted for the Congress
(I).'
What will happen to West Bengal after Mr Basu? He is in his 80s. Though in
good health, he is not expected to carry on running the state much longer.
Businessmen planning to invest in West Bengal want to be assured that there
will be stability beyond Mr Basu.
Describing West Bengal as the 'most stable state in the country,' the chief
minister says that 'one significant proof of stability is the regularity
with which the Left Front wins elections to parliament, state assembly and
local bodies.' Mr Basu certainly does not think that there will be a deluge
after him in West Bengal.

FT  11 JAN 94 / Survey of West Bengal (1): Climate changes for industry -
The Marxist government is wooing foreign investment amid clear signs of
industrial revival in the state
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SHIRAZ SIDHVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A sense of quiet optimism pervades West Bengal's business community. After a
quarter of a century of decline, the state's industrial revival seems very
much on the cards. In Calcutta, the eastern seaport which is the natural
gateway to emerging Asian nations, there is a strong campaign to revive some
of the region's lost glory as India's prime industrial heartland.
Two and a half years ago, when the Indian government embarked on its
economic reforms programme, it seemed unlikely that West Bengal, plagued by
power cuts, dead telephone lines and a declining economy, could compete with
other states to benefit from the opening up of India's economy. Today,
industry leaders are confident that West Bengal, with its strategic
location, skilled manpower and wealth of natural resources, will recreate
the industrial climate that was allowed to wither in the late 1960s.
There is reason for the optimism. After a period of stagnation, when
virtually no new investment was made in the state, over 258 projects
involving foreign investment of Rs55.9bn had been cleared by the government
up to September 1993. The Marxist state government is actively wooing
foreign investment.
There has been a dramatic improvement in power supplies - West Bengal
already has a surplus, and new power projects are being commissioned.
Telecommunications have been modernised, and telephones actually work. Last
month, businessmen, who were forced to travel to Delhi or Bombay for
international flight connections, rejoiced when British Airways and KLM
resumed operations to Calcutta.
The first signs of an industrial revival came in 1990, with the country's
two largest private sector groups - the Tatas and Reliance Industries -
investing Rs30bn and Rs3.9bn respectively in a new petrochemicals complex at
Haldia and a plastics factory. The Reliance project has yet to materialise,
but the interest shown by the two big houses was enough to put Calcutta
firmly back on the country's industrial map. The government has claimed that
the setting up of a new industrial belt at Haldia, south of Calcutta, could
create 150,000 jobs, but work on the Haldia project has been slow in
starting.
Other large projects include a Rs7.5bn pig iron plant proposed by the
Birlas, a leading Calcutta business group, Tata Iron and Steel's pig iron
plant which is nearing completion in Kharagpur, and telecom- munications and
electronic projects by Siemens and Philips respectively.
According to the Bengal Chamber of Commerce, industrial investment in West
Bengal, which averaged 9 per cent growth a year until the mid-1960s, was
falling by 0.5 per cent a year by 1985. The resource-rich region once
accounted for over 80 per cent of the country's industry but its virtual
monopoly did not survive Independence. Other parts of the country were not
obliged to deal with the problems of over-manning which new technology
exposed in West Bengal's industries.
Management controls deteriorated and several companies closed when British
and other overseas-owned companies were forced to reduce their stakes by the
socialist government in Delhi. The political instability brought about by
the ultra-left Naxalite movement in the late 1960s accentuated the problem
for a while. West Bengal's decline had begun and little was done to arrest
the damage for over 25 years, 16 of them under Marxist rule.
'The flight of top management, more than the flight of capital, contributed
to Calcutta's slide,' says Mr Mumtaz Ahmad, past president of the Bengal
Chamber. Companies such as Bata, Britannia Biscuits, Brooke Bond and Lipton
moved away from Calcutta. Even though ITC, an associate of BAT Industries,
stayed, it invested in other Indian states.
Meanwhile, the national government exercised strict control over new
investments so that it could often influence business houses to set up in
the part of the country it favoured. 'All that has changed now,' says Mr
Ahmad. 'In terms of infrastructure, natural resources like coal, plentiful
water and power, and the disciplined attitude of labour, we are all set to
compete, industry-wise and state-wise.
'The new investor to India will take the path of least resistance, and the
state government has now realised that unless we woo him, he will go
elsewhere,' says Mr Ahmad, a member of a West Bengal government committee on
infrastructure improvement, who was largely responsible for British Airways'
return to Calcutta. 'India was opening up, and Mr Basu's government realised
that if it didn't fall into line, it would be left behind.'
Indeed, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) government with Mr Jyoti Basu
at the helm, sees no contradiction between its traditional ideology and the
encouragement of a free market economy. He once explained the reason for
'the change of climate' in the state, saying: 'We criticised capitalism, but
the capitalism we criticised, no longer exists. Capitalism has changed, and
we have to change.'
Addressing potential investors in London in September last year, Mr Basu
admitted that his government had turned its immediate attention to
agriculture 'with a special emphasis on land reform for restructuring
retrograde agrarian relations.'
The West Bengal government has established a successful local
self-government system, or 'panchayats' at the village level, to allow
peasants exploited by feudal land acts to enhance their dignity, and thus
their productivity. Almost 50 per cent of the state's plan allocation has
been channelled to this decentralisation process, and as a result food
output is growing at about 5 per cent a year, one of the highest rates in
India.
Better living conditions in the villages have reduced migration to the
cities, though the influx from neighbouring states Bihar and Orissa, and
from Bangladesh have put a strain on West Bengal's already overstretched
urban resources.
Mr Basu believes that agriculture can now serve as a springboard for
industry in the state. The chief minister, who many people say is
single-handedly steering reform in the state, is keen to develop food
processing to augment traditional agro-based industries such as tea and
jute.
The development of an electronics industry could, in turn, complement the
traditional steel and engineering industries. The potential of export-led,
labour-intensive industries has appealed to Mr Basu, who is hard-pressed to
solve the state's high unemployment. The example of neighbouring Bangladesh
as a leading garment exporter is tempting to follow: the chief minister once
remarked that Calcutta had a lot of tailors, but virtually no garment
industry.
For the new investor, West Bengal has very real advantages over other Indian
regions. The state is rich in mineral wealth - coal, graphite, china clay,
granite and other precious minerals. It has a highly diversified
agricultural base, and its climate and soil are perfect for horticulture.
Technical personnel and skilled manpower are easily available, and the
financial services and banking sectors are well-developed.
But many disadvantages have still to be surmounted: an inadequate seaport, a
capital city bursting at the seams and virtually no development of satellite
townships around Calcutta, or any infrastructure to talk of in the state's
hinterland. At Writers Building, the state's seat of power, bureaucracy is
rife, with most ministers sitting on mountains of unattended paperwork.
'Change takes time to permeate,' says Mr Pradeep Das Gupta, secretary of the
Bengal Chamber. 'The government has been late in announcing a new industrial
development policy, and the sooner this is done, the better. But it is clear
that the government means business, and is thinking of an aggressive
marketing approach to sell West Bengal to foreign investors.'
Mr Krishan Lal Chugh, chairman of ITC, one of the few multinational
companies with roots firmly entrenched in Calcutta, believes the
'much-maligned city' can become a showpiece for the rest of India. He points
out that 'power cuts have been banished to Delhi,' and that Calcutta, with
its reasonable rents and stylish clubs is 'the cheapest Indian city for
executives to live in today.' The labour climate has improved, and the
quality of skilled workers and management-level executives is still the best
in the country. 'Bengal should sell,' says Mr Chugh resolutely.

FT  11 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Metal market analysts expect
slow and arduous recovery in 1994 - The worst may be over for the world's
metal producers, but a quick recovery in price levels is not on the cards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The worst is over for metals producers in this economic cycle. But analysts
suggest this does not mean that there will be a quick return to prosperity.
The move away from the depths into which prices sank last year, a plunge
that caused many producers big losses, will be slow and arduous.
Analysts surveyed by the Financial Times predict that all but one of the
London Metal Exchange-traded metals are likely to have a higher average
price this year than in 1993 - the odd one out being copper, which some
forecasters believe still has some way to fall.
Most of the analysts suggest that lead is the base metal likely to show the
biggest average price improvement this year.
Precious metals, which recovered last year from the bottom of the trough
they reached at the begining of 1993, are forecast to continue their steady
price rise.
According to Mr Philip Crowson, chief economist at RTZ Corporation, the
world's biggest mining group, base metals prices are likely to remain
subdued right into 1995. While the US economy is picking up relatively
strongly, Germany and Japan are still in the doldrums, he points out. This
will delay any increase in demand for metals.
'The traffic lights may no longer be set at red, but amber is still flashing
strongly in many important metal consuming regions,' he says.
Like many other analysts, Mr Crowson suggests that, as producers cannot
expect a strong boost in demand to come to their rescue, they must take
their fate into their own hands.
'Until there are significant and genuine productions cuts, particularly in
those metals where stocks are highest - aluminium and zinc - I see no reason
for prices to move up very much.'
Last January analysts were predicting that 1993 would be another tough year
for metals producers and their worst fears were realised.
Apart from deepening recession in most parts of the industrialised world,
only partly compensated for by a sluggish improvement in the US, producers
had to cope with worsening problems associated with the collapse of the
former Soviet Union. This has meant either a surge in metal exports from the
area (particularly of aluminium, nickel and zinc) or a steep fall in the
imports the CIS used to make.
As the accompanying chart shows, all the LME metals suffered a big drop in
average prices in 1993 compared with 1992.
In contrast gold's price, which was at a seven-year low on the first trading
day of 1993 in London, moved up - as did platinum and silver prices.
Mr Nick Moore, analyst at Ord Minnett, now partly owned by the Jardine
Matheson trading group, points out that in many previous economic cycles
base metals have recovered nine to ten months after precious metals prices
moved away from their lows. 'This seems to be happening again.'
As usual, some predictions stand out because they are against the trend set
by most of the analysts. For example, Mr Dan Roling at the Merrill Lynch
financial services group, and Mr Wiktor Bielski at Bain &amp; Co, a Deutsche
Bank company, are predicting a strong rise in copper's price while most of
their competitors suggest a lacklustre performance can be expected from this
metal.
Mr Bielski explains his position: 'The fundamentals in the copper market are
getting better all the time'.
He cites US copper demand, up more than 8 per cent in 1993, and recent falls
in copper stocks on both the New York Commodity Exchange and the LME. Stocks
represent only about eight weeks' consumption, the lowest ever coming out of
a recession, he points out. There was probably a 1.5 per cent increase in
western world copper demand last year compared with 1992 and 'people are
begining to realise there will not be a surge in supply in 1994'.
He says only 60,000 to 70,000 tonnes of extra annual copper capacity is
scheduled for 1994 - the big surge is due in 1995.
From his New York base Mr Roling is out of step with the other (mainly
London-based) analysts in his forecast of a steep drop in zinc prices. He
explains: 'I believe there will be no production cuts'.
Ord Minnett's Mr Moore stands out as a bull of aluminium. He remains
convinced the aluminium industry will find a way before long to solve the
international crisis caused by supplies of the metal - much of it from
Russia - swamping demand. He says most of the improvement in aluminium's
price, and the prices of other base metals, will come in the second half
when he predicts that London Metal Exchange stocks, at present at record
levels, 'will fall precipitously'.
Precious metals analysts whose forecasts are not in the chart include Mr
Andy Smith at Union Bank of Switzerland, who suggests that the price of gold
might move over Dollars 400 an ounce in the short term. Looking a year
ahead, however, he sees the metal back at Dollars 350 an ounce.
Mr George Milling-Stanley at Lehman Brothers, the New York financial
services group, is forecasting an average gold price of about Dollars 375 an
ounce in 1994. He also suggests there will be a higher range for gold this
year - of Dollars 420 to Dollars 350, compared with 1993's range of Dollars
410 to Dollars 325.
He says: 'Speculative buying may carry the price beyond the 1993 high, but
gold has stalled between Dollars 400 and Dollars 430 on several occasions in
recent years, and this area can be expected to provide considerable
resistance'.

FT  11 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gold price takes another knock
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Gold's price, which started the new year seemingly set to rise to Dollars
400 a troy ounce, took another big knock in hectic European trading
yesterday that saw it close in London at Dollars 383.10, down Dollars 5.15
from Friday's close.
The trend started in New York on Friday when some institutional investors
switched money from gold to bonds, traders suggested, partly because the
institutions were disappointed that the precious metal had failed to break
through the Dollars 400 level.
Analysts suggested yesterday's drop had changed gold's technical picture and
it could be heading for further falls - with Dollars 380, Dollars 375 and
Dollars 370 an ounce important 'support' points on the way down. Gold
bounced off Dollars 379.85 at the lowest level in London yesterday, at which
point bargain hunters appeared, traders said.
There were some rumours that Australian producers were selling gold again
yesterday after restraining themselves as the price approached Dollars 400.
In contrast, the Reuter news agency reported suggestions that South Africans
had been supporting the market.

FT  11 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: US/China wheat deal shows trade
war is still on - A heavily subsidised sale that appears to defy the spirit
of the Gatt settlement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The floor of the Chicago Board of Trade reacted like a firework to a lighted
match last Tuesday morning to news that China wanted to purchase 1.1m tonnes
of US soft wheat. Traders roared and wheat futures soared to all-time highs.
China, once the US's largest wheat customer, has not purchased grain since
July 29 and if this huge sale is completed US soft wheat stocks could be
drawn down to unexpectedly low levels.
In the midst of the tumult several puzzled traders stumbled out of the pit
and punched their calculators. China had bid Dollars 88.50 a tonne for the
wheat, about Dollars 2.40 per bushel, well under the world export price. For
the sale to go through, the US government would have to escalate the
US/European Union grain war to new heights, kicking in more than Dollars 60
a tonne to subsidise the sale through its Export Enhancement Programme.
Only weeks after the US and EC had agreed to begin to reduce farm trade
friction through a new General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, would the US
government back aggressive subsidies for the China sale, the traders
wondered, or would it pass, causing the futures rally to fizzle on news of
an incomplete sale Wednesday morning?
As it turned out, the Gatt agreement had done nothing to cool the trade war.
The US Department of Agriculture agreed to pay a Dollars 53.5m subsidy to
induce China to buy 815,000 tonnes of wheat, with an average 'bonus' of
Dollars 65.61 a tonne, the biggest export subsidy awarded this year. US
taxpayers will contribute about Dollars 1.78 and the Chinese government
Dollars 2.40 for each bushel.
Before the Gatt settlement it was understandable for the US to keep up trade
pressure on the EC, says Mr Dale Gustafson, cereals analyst for Smith Barney
Shearson. 'The intent was to keep the negotiators at the table.' Now, he
says, for the US to escalate the subsidy war 'is a bit surprising'. Other
analysts are more outspoken, calling current world export subsidy levels
'insanity'.
Since 1985 the US has spent Dollars 6.2bn to subsidise wheat exports,
including Dollars 470m since October. The EU, trying to market a mountainous
surplus, has done the same. The trade war has distorted domestic farm
programmes and crumpled markets for countries which do not subsidise
exports.
While the US has maintained world market share with subsidies, the supply
situation at home has shifted dramatically. Floods, drought and frost have
eroded US wheat yields and quality for the last two harvests, leaving
supplies historically short. Mr Dick Lowey, president of the research firm
AgResources, estimates that only 35m to 45m bushels of soft red winter
wheat, the variety most competitive with EU wheat, will be left in farmers'
bins at the end of this season, barely enough to prime the export pipeline.
Arranging a ceasefire in a 9-year trade war is difficult. 'The wheels of
government move slowly,' says one USDA export analyst who asks not to be
identified. 'What happens to EEP after Gatt remains to be seen.'
The Gatt settlement calls for a gradual reduction in cereals subsidies. One
of its aims is to draw down the EU's 23m-tonne wheat stock over a six-year
period. AgResources' Mr Lowey believes the US will soon begin to lower its
subsidies to destinations like Morrocco, allowing a modest shift in its
wheat exports to the EU. He says US wheat prices, now nearing Dollars 4 a
bushel, reflect concern that US wheat supplies may not rebuild quickly
without that shift. 'We're at a stage where we should begin to phase out
subsidies, and I think we'll begin to see that (reflected in EEP bonus
levels) soon,' he suggests.

FT  11 JAN 94 / Government Bonds: Jitters over new supply leave long-dated
gilt prices lower
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Auction jitters pushed UK government bond prices lower yesterday and,
although the market recovered slightly, long-dated gilts still ended the day
about a quarter of a point lower.
Dealers expect the Bank of England to announce the preliminary details of
the January gilt auction this week. The market expects the new supply to be
at the very long end, with either a new 20-year or a new 25-year gilt as the
auction stock.
Such an announcement is likely to depress long-dated gilts, dealers said,
especially since it would probably be interpreted as signalling that the
Bank sees little scope for a further reduction in long gilt yields.
The economic news released yesterday had little impact on gilt prices and
economists said it provided confirmation of a recovery, although the
consumer credit figures were slightly weaker than expected, with net
consumer credit rising by Pounds 290m in November.
Looking ahead this week, the gilt market will focus on the unemployment
figures tomorrow and the meeting between the Mr Kenneth Clark, the
chancellor of the exchequer and Mr Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of
England, for a signal on interest rates.
Among the high-yielding European government bond markets Italy closed
three-quarters of a point down, rattled by further political scandals,
dealers said.
The Liffe March futures contract ended 0.78 down at 117.10, off the low
price of 117.05. The bond market fell on rumours that top politicians were
involved in an alleged attempt to hush up a scandal over secret service
slush funds.
Spanish bonds saw some weakness, dealers reporting foreign selling of
Spanish paper because of worries about the peseta and unease over the
Banesto debacle.
German government bonds ended the day almost unchanged, showing little
response to news that western Germany's gross domestic product shrunk by 1.9
per cent in 1993, following growth of 1.6 per cent in 1992.
Elsewhere in Europe, the French market fell back on disappointment over the
lack of an interest rate cut.
Swedish government bonds, which had rallied strongly last week as details of
the government's budget proposals leaked into the market, ended yesterday
little changed as expectations were generally confirmed, dealers said.
After early profit-taking following last Friday's strong rally had pushed US
Treasury prices lower in the morning, the bond market rallied in the
afternoon to leave longer-dated issues little changed.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down only 3/32 at
100 1/4 , yielding 6.226 per cent, and the two-year note unchanged at 100
11/32 , to yield 4.049 per cent.
The selling of longer-dated Treasuries began overnight on foreign markets
and, after a brief rebound, continued into the morning in New York. Traders
were not concerned by the activity, which they categorised as natural
profit-taking.

FT  11 JAN 94 / International Bonds: Global offerings meet demand for higher
yields
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN and CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Global bond offerings in yen, Canadian dollars and Finnish markka yesterday
reflected the growing trend for such offerings across a broader range of
currencies, as investors become increasingly willing to buy foreign currency
bonds in search of higher yields.
Italy's Y300bn seven-year global bond met strong demand, particularly in
Japan, where it can be placed with both retail and institutional investors
following last month's easing of regulations.
Although the whole deal could easily have been placed in Japan, according to
lead manager Daiwa Europe, at least half of the issue will be sold
elsewhere.
Joint lead manager JP Morgan reported surprisingly strong sales to US
investors, who are not usually buyers of yen bonds. They were said to be
attracted by the liquidity of the deal, and are bullish on both Japanese
interest rates and on the yen's performance against the dollar.
The deal will be priced at 7am in London today, at a yield spread of 41 - 43
basis points above the seven-year Japanese government bond.
Strong demand is likely to lead to a pricing at the tighter end of that
range, representing a cost of funds for Italy of less than 20 basis points
above dollar Libor,
The Canadian dollar sector was dominated by a CDollars 1bn global bond
offering by Hydro-Quebec, one of Canada's largest power utilities, via
Merrill Lynch and ScotiaMcLeod.
The 10-year bonds, priced to yield 71 basis points over the new Canadian
benchmark, got off to a slow start but eventually met broad-based demand, a
syndicate official at one of the lead managers said.
He estimated that some 20 per cent of the deal was bought by Far Eastern
investors, with another 40 per cent flowing into European accounts and 40
per cent taken by North American investors.
Finnish Export Credit launched the first ever global bond offering in the
Finnish markka market. The FM2bn deal due 1999 will be priced today at 25
basis points over the comparable Finnish government bond.
Although issuance in the Finnish markka sector is widely expected to
increase this year - this deal alone exceeds last year's total - further
global deals are unlikely, as no other Finnish borrowers (apart from the
Republic) are registered with the US Securities &amp; Exchange Commission and
swap opportunities are meagre.
In the sterling sector, the Halifax Building Society launched a Pounds 500m
10-year deal, priced to yield 32 basis points over the comparable gilt. The
deal, which was unusually large for a building society issue, attracted
strong demand, partly because of the lack of current coupon paper in the
sector.
Also in the sterling sector, the City of Salford and Leicester City Council
launched the first local authority bonds since 1982, with deals totalling
Pounds 100m and Pounds 80m respectively. Both issues were placed in the
sterling domestic market by UBS.
Meanwhile, Hongkong Land Holdings' first ever international bond issue met
strong investor demand.
The company issued Dollars 360m of convertible bonds to refinance its
investment in Trafalgar House, the troubled conglomerate in which it holds a
25 per cent stake.
According to an official at the lead manager, Jardine Fleming, the paper was
snapped up by investors in Hong Kong, the UK, the US and Switzerland. 'It's
the bluest of Hong Kong blue chips,' he said. Hongkong Land, which has a
stranglehold on office space in the colony's central business sector, is set
to benefit from this year's expected rise in property valuations and rental
rates.

FT  11 JAN 94 / International Capital Markets: Improvement in credit ratings
of European issuers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN and RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
European issuers' credit quality declined further in 1993, but the
deterioration is set to slow in 1994, according to Standard &amp; Poor's, the US
credit rating agency.
Although downgrades outpaced upgrades in 1993, fewer ratings were lowered
than in the previous two years, S&amp;P said yesterday. In 1993, 48 European
issuers were downgraded and seven upgraded, compared with 65 downgrades and
no upgrades in 1992.
But while ratings should be more stable this year, Europe is not likely to
see the turnround that is taking place in the US, where upgrades now outpace
downgrades.
European downgrades last year were concentrated in Sweden, Finland, France
and Italy. The banking sector accounted for the bulk of the European
downgrades, with 23 out of a total of 48. In most European markets, economic
recession and weak real estate markets played a part in declining credit
quality.
However, the sector also suffered from fundamental changes in the industry,
involving deregulation and internationalisation which increased competition.
Moreover, in some European countries, moves to sell state-owned banks put
pressure on ratings, said Mr Barry Hancock, head of S&amp;P's banking group. He
said bank downgradings would probably fall in 1994 but warned that ratings
were unlikely to bounce back to pre-recession levels.
Although the European credit outlook for 1994 is more positive than in
recent years, the agency warned that recovery has been relatively weak and
the recession in Germany could stall recovery elsewhere.
Last year's improvement in credit quality among many US bond issuers could
be threatened by a resurgence of borrowing, in part to finance takeovers,
the two largest US credit rating agencies warned.
S&amp;P said it raised more ratings than it lowered for the first time since
1980, while Moody's reported upgrades outnumbering downgrades for the first
time in nine years.
An improvement in the financial structure of many US companies, rather than
an upturn in the economy, had accounted for the improving credit picture,
Moody's senior economist John Lonski said. Many companies had taken
advantage of the strong stock market to raise equity and reduce their
gearing.
Both agencies pointed to banking as the sector where the greatest number of
upgrades had been achieved. Non-investment grade (or junk) bonds also saw
strong improvements, the first overall increase in credit quality in this
market since 1980.
Both warned, though, that increased borrowing to back takeovers could weaken
the balance sheets of some companies this year.
Mr Leo O'Neill, president of S&amp;P, said: 'Size does not equate to strength;
perceived synergies do not automatically create products and services
consumers need, or even want; and acquiring companies using a surfeit of
debt may leave the combined operation too weak to confront unexpected
contingencies.'

FT  11 JAN 94 / International Company News: Michelin to launch FFr3.5bn
convertible bond
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Michelin, the French tyre manufacturer, yesterday announced it would launch
a FFr3.5bn convertible bond issue in a move to reduce its debt, diversify
its sources of finance and reinforce its financial structure.
The company, which had first-half losses of FFr3.19bn (Dollars 540m) last
year after provisions for restructuring, has debts of about FFr30bn.
Michelin said last night, however, that it was confident of recovery in the
international tyre market. It said the recovery in the North American market
should continue over the next few years and that the sharp price competition
which started at the beginning of last year had stabilised.
In Europe, which suffered a particularly sharp contraction in 1993, Michelin
said there were signs that the decline in sales had ended. Some markets,
such as the UK, had seen the start of recovery, according to the company.
The group said its restructuring plan, which involves the loss of 2,950 jobs
and a reduction of operating costs by FFr3.5bn by the middle of next year,
was on schedule. Provisions for the costs of the restructuring plan, which
total about FFr2.6bn, were taken in the first half of last year.
Industry analysts in Paris said that the convertible bond issue was timed to
tap the buoyant Paris stock market. Yesterday, the CAC-40 index of leading
shares reached another record, rising 0.4 per cent to close at 2,317.
Under the terms of the issue, to be launched on January 12, bonds will be
priced at FFr255. On Monday, before news of the issue, Michelin shares rose
FFr3 to a 12-month high of FFr229.1.
The bonds, which can be exchanged on the basis of one for one share from
February 2, will mature on January 1, 2001. They will carry an interest rate
of 2.5 per cent, or FFr6.38, payable on January 1 each year.
Michelin said the yield would be 5.03 per cent if the bonds are not
converted. On maturity, they will be repaid at FFr307 each, or 120.39 per
cent of the issue price.
Existing shareholders will be given a priority entitlement of one bond for
every 15 shares between January 12 and January 21 inclusive.

FT  11 JAN 94 / International Company News: Hong Leong gains banking
respectability - Quek Leng Chan and the Malaysian conglomerate he heads
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Quek Leng Chan, head of Malaysia's Hong Leong group of companies, is a
renowned gambler. He has been known to wager thousands of dollars on the
casino tables. Every Christmas, he is said to take his one holiday of the
year - in Las Vegas.
But in business, Mr Quek, a lawyer by training and one of Malaysia's most
powerful but reclusive corporate leaders, is regarded as a shrewd and
patient planner, interested more in long-term strategy than short-term
gains.
From modest beginnings in the late 1960s, Hong Leong (HL) has grown into one
of the biggest conglomerates in Malaysia. It is involved in virtually every
aspect of the country's economy, from the manufacture of roofing tiles and
semiconductors to newspapers and property. HL's 10 companies, listed on the
Kuala Lumpur stock market, have an annual turnover of more than MDollars
3.4bn (USDollars 1.3bn).
Mr Quek also heads a spreading regional empire involved, among other things,
in motorcycle manufacturing in China, mining in the Philippines and property
and stockbroking in Britain.
Now the final touches have been put on a MDollars 1.1bn deal which will make
Mr Quek a main force in Malaysia's fast-expanding financial services sector.
After protracted negotiations HL has gained control of MUI Bank, a Malaysian
bank with 35 retail branches within Malaysia and one in Singapore. An
associated finance company, MUI Finance, is also being brought under HL
control.
'The acquisition of MUI Bank and Finance is the last piece in HL's corporate
structure,' says an analyst. 'HL has gained the respectability associated
with retail banking operations and now has the financial muscle to rival any
'hong' in the region.'
HL's expansion has been closely associated with the political rise of Mr
Anwar Ibrahim, Malaysia's finance minister. In Malaysia, as with most
countries in south-east Asia, politics and business are often closely
related.
Analysts say Mr Quek backed the finance minister's successful bid late last
year for the deputy leadership of the United Malays National Organisation
(UMNO), the dominant political party in the country. Mr Anwar is seen as the
leader of a new generation of Malays, and the man most likely to succeed Dr
Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysia's prime minister for the past 12 years.
Last January, HL helped four supporters of Mr Anwar in a MDollars 800m
management buy-out of both the New Straits Times, Malaysia's main newspaper
and publishing group, and the country's only privately-held TV station.
Analysts say Mr Anwar, who would have the final say on a transaction like
the MUI deal, has given a big fillip to HL's expansion plans; banking
licences are hard to come by in Malaysia.
Mr Anwar has denied any favouritism. 'I don't favour any group. As long as
everything is in order and it benefits the economy, business proposals will
be approved,' he said.
Like many of his fellow multi-millionaire Chinese businessmen in south-east
Asia, Mr Quek's ancestors were poor immigrants from southern China. The clan
first settled in Singapore, where one branch of the family, with the surname
Kwek, runs a separate HL group. The bigger, more diversified HL group is
headquartered in Kuala Lumpur, under the control of 50-year-old Mr Quek.
'HL is a very Chinese company in that Quek and his family keep tight control
on all operations, but the group has highly professional managers at its
centre,' says a fellow Chinese businessman.
HL's Malaysian operations are divided into three main parts. Construction is
headed by Hume Industries, one of Malaysia's biggest building companies.
Hume is expanding rapidly in tandem with a massive infrastructure
development programme now being undertaken Malaysia. Hume also recently
bought an 85 per cent stake in Nanyang press, publishers of Malaysia's
highest circulation daily Chinese newspaper.
Hong Leong Industries (HLI) manufactures building materials and is also
involved in the motorcycle industry, with a 50 per cent share of the
Malaysian market. Associated companies are involved in steel production,
electronics and packaging.
With the acquisition of MUI Bank and Finance, market attention in the coming
months is likely to focus on HL Credit (HLC), the financial arm of Mr Quek's
empire. Analysts say Mr Quek is likely to use HLC's estimated asset base of
MDollars 5bn to become a market leader in Malaysia's fast expanding
financial services sector.
Most of HL's overseas operations are believed to be held under the Hong
Kong-listed Guoco group of companies, with assets estimated at USDollars
3bn. Through Guoco, Mr Quek is a controlling shareholder in the Dao Heng
Bank and Overseas Trust Bank in Hong Kong. Associated activities in Hong
Kong include insurance and stockbroking.
Mr Quek is known as one of biggest players on the Kuala Lumpur stock
exchange. Analysts say that with the Kuala Lumpur market going up 98 per
cent last year, Mr Quek has become considerably richer in recent months -
though they hesitate to put a figure on his personal wealth.
Meanwhile, HL companies are making handsome profits - Hume's pre-tax profit
was MDollars 134m in the year to June 1993 compared to MDollars 103m in the
previous period. '1993 was quite a year for Quek Leng Chan,' said a fellow
Malaysian businessman. 'He backed the right politician, he became head of a
banking empire and shares in his companies raced ahead on the stockmarket.
He probably won at the tables as well.'

FT  11 JAN 94 / International Company News: BZ Trust to reduce commission
charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BZ Trust, the fund management unit of the BZ banking group in Zurich, has
agreed to reduce the commission it charges for managing the three investment
companies controlled by the group.
BZ has come under public criticism for the massive commissions earned in the
past year, although BZ officials insist that no investors have complained.
In the first eight months of the fiscal year, it earned SFr132.7m (Dollars
90.2m) for managing BK Vision, a quoted company that specialises in holding
banking shares. In the first six months, it earned SFr140.4m from Pharma
Vision, another quoted company which specialises in pharmaceutical shares.
The performance related commission structure has been based on the market
capitalisation of the companies rather than their net asset value.
However, a significant part of the commissions paid arose because the prices
of the Vision shares moved in the past two years from discounts of roughly
10 per cent against net asset value to premiums of a similar order.
Mr Kurt Schiltknecht, president of BZ Trust, said that as of the fourth
quarter of last year, commissions have been based on the lower of market
value and net asset value.
The result in the fourth quarter was to reduce BZ Trust's total commission
income by between SFr150m and SFr200m.

FT  11 JAN 94 / International Company News: Good second quarter for Gold
Fields companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Gold Fields of South Africa has reported a dip in after-tax profit to
R387.7m (Dollars 76.5m) in the second quarter to December from R396.7m in
the September quarter, after higher gold output was offset by a lower gold
price received.
The weaker gold price, down to R39,758 a kilogram from R41,640 a kilogram,
masked a good operating performance from the group's four mining companies.
Mr Alan Munro, executive director, said yesterday that the quarter was
'satisfactory' as management successfully 'kept the lid on costs'.
He noted that despite the more or less flat quarter-on-quarter performance,
results for the half year showed after-tax profit improved to R784.3m from
R497m in the same period in 1992.
The after-tax profit in the second quarter a year ago was R270.2m.
Overall gold production for the second quarter rose to 30,713 kilograms from
29,259 kilograms, reflecting an increase in tonnes of ore milled and better
grades.
Working profit increased marginally to R491.7m from R491.3m, but a decline
in the group's tax provisions to R142.5m from R148.6m was outweighed by a
fall in sundry revenue to R38.5m from R53.9m.
Driefontein, South Africa's most profitable gold mine, had a strong quarter.
Its east division hit patches of unexpectedly good ground, lifting its grade
by more than 10 per cent to a four-year high of 10.5 grams a tonne.
After-tax profit rose to R194.4m against R185m.
Mr Munro praised the results from Kloof, the other large producer in the
group, which showed no ill effects from the accident in October which badly
damaged one of its shafts and trapped 150 miners underground for several
days. He said the mine had enough ore reserves stored above ground to ensure
it maintained its gold output for as long as it took to repair the damaged
shaft.
With better performances from its Leeudorn and Libanon divisions, Kloof's
results were dented only by weaker gold price. After-tax profit fell to
R174m from R187.5m.
Doornfontien, under threat of closure for some time, was able to maintain
its recent profitability by mining more underground ore, turning in almost
unchanged after-tax profit of R4.33m compared with R4.57m. Mr Munro said the
mine's future was dependent on improved gold prices and the development of
more underground ore reserves.
The group's other producer Deelkraal struggled to meet production targets,
but made an after-tax profit of R14.9m.

Gillette, the US shaving and consumer products group, yesterday announced
plans to reorganise its overseas operations in a move that will bring 2,000
job losses over the next two years and a one-time after-tax charge of
Dollars 164m in the fourth quarter of 1993.
It said sales, profits and earnings were expected to reach record levels in
the fourth quarter before special charges, reflecting the introduction of
new products and the inclusion for the first time of results from Parker
Pen, which it bought last May.
The company said that the job losses, which represent about 6 per cent of
the workforce, would fall largely outside the US, but did not specify where.
Gillette said that the cuts were likely to be balanced by growth elsewhere,
so overall employment would remain roughly at the present level of 34,000 by
the end of the year.
Mr Alfred Zeien, chairman and chief executive, said the company needed to
reorganise so that it could compete more effectively and expand in
international markets.

Atlantic Richfield (Arco) is to take a charge of Dollars 450m after tax to

The charge, announced yesterday and to be included in fourth-quarter figures

'substantial' charge to reshape the bulk of its US operations.
It covers severance costs from shedding 1,300 jobs, as well as the

protection

<TEXT>
Conran Stores, which operates the US branch of the Habitat chain founded by
Sir Terence Conran in the UK, is seeking protection from creditors under
Chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy code.
The company's 14 home furnishings stores, which operate in the US under the
Habitat name, were trading yesterday as attempts were made to find a buyer,
but it seemed unlikely they would continue in their existing form.
Conran Stores is owned by a group of US investors headed by Mr Marvin Traub,
a former chairman of the Bloomingdale's department store group. They bought
the loss-making company from Storehouse, the UK retailing group, in 1992.
The company said the 'difficult and very competitive retail environment and
the continuing general economic decline which had severely affected Conran's
during prior years proved too high a hurdle to overcome.'
Discussions were being held with several parties, but if these proved
unsuccessful the company would 'take appropriate action to maximise
recoveries from a prompt disposition of its assets.'

FT  11 JAN 94 / International Company News: Federated eyes a bargain buy in
Macy's - Merger would create retailing empire with turnover of Dollars 13bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Federated Department Stores' attempt to take over the equally prominent R.
H. Macy group is unusual by even US standards.
The merger of two of the world's best-known names in department stores -
Federated owns Bloomingdale's and several other US chains - would create a
vast retailing empire.
But this is no ordinary takeover bid. R. H. Macy has been operating under
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection since January 1992, so its future lies in
the hands of creditors rather than shareholders.
Instead of bidding for Macy's equity, Federated has staked a claim on the
company by acquiring Dollars 449m worth of its highest-ranking debt from the
Prudential Insurance Company of America, just as Macy's prepares its plans
for a capital reorganisation.
If Federated succeeds in acquiring Macy's, it will become the biggest
department store group in the US. Apart from Bloomingdale's, Federated owns
the A&amp;S, Jordan Marsh, Stern's, Lazarus, Rich's, Goldsmith's, Burdines and
Bon Marche chains in the US. Its 219 stores recorded sales of Dollars 7bn in
1992.
R. H. Macy, with 111 stores in the Macy's and Bullock's chains, turned over
Dollars 6.3bn in the year to last July, so the combined group's turnover of
more than Dollars 13bn would put it in the number one slot above May
Department Stores, which had 1992 turnover of Dollars 11bn.
Nevertheless, Federated's strategy raises an obvious question. Why would
anybody want to take over a bankrupt department store group - particularly
when department stores are seen as the dinosaurs of retailing, losing market
share to newer shopping formats such as out-of-town malls and warehouse
clubs?
Part of the answer lies in the fact that the death of the US department
store has been exaggerated. Some of its problems were as much to do with
over-leveraged buy-outs in the 1980s as they were to do with loss of
customers.
Most groups are now doing modestly well, especially those - like Federated -
which have restructured balance sheets, improved buying, dropped
money-losing lines and made their stores more attractive.
Yet department stores ignore the competitive threat at their peril.
Consumers want value for money, and other retailing formats are only too
keen to deliver. Mr Allen Questrom, Federated's chairman and chief
executive, says that if department stores are going to be around in the 21st
century, they have to get their costs down to a level where they can
compete.
Federated - which itself emerged from bankruptcy protection nine days after
Macy's went into it - has achieved an impressive financial recovery in the
two years since by securing internal efficiencies.
But the next step, Mr Questrom says, must be to improve competitiveness and
deliver better value to customers by securing the economies of scale that
come with being a bigger group - for example, by winning greater buying
clout and spreading administration costs across a larger sales base.
Mr Questrom may yet be thwarted. To succeed with a bid, he will have to win
the support of Macy's other creditors by persuading them that his plan is in
their interests as well as his own company's.
The bankruptcy court judge will have to be similarly persuaded, and may also
need to be convinced that a merger would not be anti-competitive.
Macy's has until March 15 to come up with a reorganisation plan (though it
can plead for more time). Some suspect Federated will use its position to
block the Macy plan and impose its own, but Mr Questrom insists all he wants
to do is put forward an alternative and let creditors decide.
'This is not a hostile takeover,' he says. 'We wouldn't do it, the courts
wouldn't let us do it, and that's not our intent.'
As for anti-trust issues, Mr Questrom dismisses them as irrelevant. Maybe
there was a time when department stores dominated US retailing, he says, but
it has long gone. The entire department store sector sells less in a year
than Wal-Mart, the large discount-store group, and faces competition from an
ever-increasing proliferation of formats.
Nevertheless, Macy will certainly not give up without a fight. Other
would-be bidders, such as May Department Stores or Dillard Department
Stores, may yet enter the fray. Federated itself may walk away if, on closer
examination, it decides the deal does not make sense.
What of the Dollars 449m of shareholders' money that Federated has already
spent? Mr Questrom says he is not worried. The debt it has bought ranks
above all other claims against Macy, is secured against 70 stores, and is
piling up interest at the rate of 12 per cent a year.
Even if Macy were to collapse, Mr Questrom says, Federated would still get
its money back when the assets were sold. 'It's a good investment. If it
doesn't materialise into a combination, there's very little downside,' he
says.

KNP BT, the Netherlands' biggest paper and packaging group, has disposed of
its 46 per cent stake in Ahrend, the Dutch office furnisher. The move brings
to an end a stalemate that has existed between the two companies since a
failed takeover attempt in 1989.
The shareholding, worth around Fl 100m (Dollars 51m), was placed mainly with
institutional investors, with Ahrend itself buying back around 10 per cent
of the shares.
The Ahrend shares are a legacy of an unsuccessful takeover attempt nearly
five years ago by Buhrmann-Tetterode (BT), which merged in early 1993 with
KNP and VRG of the Netherlands to form KNP BT.
KNP BT said that the disposal would lead to an unspecified extraordinary
gain. However, the company added that, overall, it would be taking an
extraordinary charge of around Fl 300m this year to finance reorganisations,
in line with earlier predictions.
KNP BT indicated last year that it wanted to sell its Ahrend shares, saying
the shareholding had been downgraded from a strategic to a financial
investment.

Mr Alfred Zeien, chairman and chief executive, said the company needed to
reorganise to compete more effectively and expand in international markets.
Part of the plan will be to reorganise its international manufacturing
operations, dedicating plants to specific product lines instead of expecting
each of them to make a diverse range of goods.
The group also aims to improve efficiency by consolidating some of its
warehouses and sales centres and by integrating computer networks.
Gillette's products include razors and toiletries sold under the Gillette
brand, Oral-B toothbrushes, Parker and Paper Mate pens, and Braun electrical
goods.
Most of its operations are in the US, Europe and Latin America, but it is
also expanding in other markets, such as China, India and Turkey.
Mr Zeien said the effect of the efficiency savings would be felt mainly next
year and there would be no significant impact on the current year's results.

<TEXT>
Roche, one of the big three Swiss pharmaceutical groups, recorded an 11 per
cent increase in consolidated 1993 sales to SFr14.3bn (Dollars 9.7bn),
following a 13 per cent rise in 1992. It said all divisions contributed to
the sales increase.
The Basle-based group, which normally provides a full financial report in
April, indicated it achieved 'a significant increase' in group profit. In
1992, consolidated net income rose 29 per cent to SFr1.9bn.
Roche said operating profit last year was boosted by 'a better utilisation
of production capacity and consistent management of costs'.
The significant increase in net income was also due to 'another healthy
result in the non-operating sector'.
The group says that it has been only marginally affected by government
pressure on drug prices in many countries. In Italy, the most recent
European country to act in this area, Roche said it achieved real growth in
sales last year, although the devaluation of the lire hurt the Swiss franc
result.
Investors have showed great confidence in the group, bidding up its
non-voting shares 51 per cent last year after a 60 per cent rise the
previous year. Its current market capitalisation of about SFr61bn makes it
the world's most highly valued pharmaceutical group.
The group had liquid reserves of more than SFr12bn at the end of 1992.
The pharmaceutical division, which accounts for more than half of total
sales, reported a 13 per cent rise in revenue to SFr7.8bn.
The leading drugs (Rocephin, an anti-infection treatment, Dormicum-Versed, a
mild anaesthetic, Roaccutane for treating severe acne, Furtulon for treating
solid tumours and Roferon-A for cancer and anti-viral therapy) continued to
record volume increases. Sales of the self-medication business, Roche
Consumer Health, surpassed SFr1bn.
Sales of vitamins and fine chemicals advanced 7 per cent to SFr3.3bn, due to
strong demand for vitamin E, beta-carotene and the feed additive
Astaxanthin. The diagnostics division reported a 10 per cent rise in
revenues to SFr1.7bn, while revenues of the flavours and fragrances division
were up 8 per cent to SFr1.4bn.

FT  11 JAN 94 / International Company News: Banks asked for new
Metallgesellschaft credits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Metallgesellschaft's bank creditors heard yesterday that they were expected
to extend new credits worth DM700m (Dollars 407m) to the crisis-torn German
metals and engineering group as part of the rescue package put forward last
Wednesday.
The request, restricted to banks which are owed more than DM50m, was DM200m
more than the figure mentioned at last week's crisis meeting, when the new
management also proposed raising DM1.4bn through a share issue, plus a
DM1.3bn debt-for-equity swap.
It came in a note sent out yesterday that was described by one source as
'long on what is required of the banks but short on the new strategic
direction of the group'.
The note said that participants in the new credit line would be granted a
charge over Metallgesellschaft assets assembled in what one banker described
as a 'security pool'.
It is understood that Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank, both house banks to
and shareholders in Metallgesellschaft, will not be involved in this part of
the proposed deal.
The two banks contributed an estimated DM1bn in fresh credits late last year
when details first emerged of the oil market speculation losses which have
brought the group to the brink of insolvency.
Although smaller lenders are believed to be anxious that the new proposal
relegates their debt to junior status, bankers on balance believed that the
rescue would go ahead.
'There are not many people around who think they will be better off if they
allow the company to go down,' one noted. Lenders and shareholders, who have
until the end of Wednesday to approve the deal, accept that insolvency is
the only alternative to agreement.
Mr Eberhard Zinn, a director of the Bayerische Landesbank, one of
Metallgesellschaft's biggest lenders, said his board had not yet made a
formal decision, but added: 'We hope we will be able to get it through.'
Mr Zinn told the Reuters news agency that some foreign creditors might have
difficulties accepting the package 'above all for reasons of timing'. But it
was important that such lenders - accounting for around half the total of
100-plus banks involved - should agree, he added.
Non-German bankers complained yesterday at the lack of time allowed for
consideration, the rigidity of the conditions and their inability to
negotiate.
'There will be many lessons to be drawn from this. It does not paint a very
flattering picture of the German way of doing things,' one said.
'Some people may try to lay down conditions for participating, but I suspect
they will join in, kicking and squealing,' another added.

Several western media companies, including Bertelsmann of Germany, Companie
Luxembourgeoise de Telediffusion (CLT) and Time Warner of the US, will
compete for control of Poland's first commercial TV channel.
Applications for the licence, which is to run for 10 years, are to be heard
in a series of public hearings by the Radio and TV Council, a regulatory
body, starting on Friday. A decision on the licence is expected soon after.
The channel will require an initial investment of up to Dollars 100m and
will operate alongside the two Polish state channels which carry
advertising. The new station will be competing for advertising revenues
estimated at about Dollars 100m a year. Initially, the station aims to reach
about half of Poland's population of 40m.
Foreign ownership of the broadcast media is limited to 33 per cent, and the
foreign companies involved had to find local partners.
Bertelsmann, which has said it will invest Dollars 200m, is linked with the
state-owned Polish Development Bank and the Warta insurance company. CLT,
working with Reuters Television, has ITI, a local video and screen
distributor.
Time Warner, CNN and Capital Cities ABC are linked to a number of
journalists from the soon-to-be-closed Radio Free Europe. The journalists
are led by Mr Marian Terlecki, a former head of state television.
The other main contender is NTP Plus, a group of journalists with roots in
the Solidarity movement. They are backed by CEDC Media Enterprises, which
has a broadcast licence in Prague and is controlled by Mr Mark Palmer, a
former US ambassador.
Canal Plus, the French pay-TV channel, is backing another Polish group.
Kinnevik Media International of Sweden is competing, as is Polonia 1, a
chain of stations controlled by Mr Nicola Grauso, a Sardinian media owner.

FT  11 JAN 94 / International Company News: Ifil seeks a winning combination
 -Haig Simonian analyses the holding company's complex web of deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Even by the recent standards of many Italian companies, the past three
months have been extraordinarily busy for Ifil, the holding group indirectly
controlled by the wealthy Agnelli family.
Since October, Turin-based Ifil has spent L652bn (Dollars 397m) on a
controlling stake in La Rinascente, Italy's biggest retailer; increased its
share in Fiat to more than 12 per cent and launched a large rights issue to
finance its ambitions.
As part of its diversification into non-cyclical sectors such as foods and
tourism, Ifil has struck a string of deals with important business partners,
notably in France, ranging from hotels in Hungary to foodstuffs in Hong
Kong.
However, Ifil's moves have not been unanimously acclaimed. The complex
Rinascente deal, in which the Fiat-controlled retailer passed to Ifil via
Fiat's own shareholders, was pilloried by some analysts as an in-house
arrangement tailored to bolster Fiat's flagging finances more than the
interest of Ifil's shareholders.
Ifil's decision to spend more than L770bn on increasing its stake in the
cars group has come under fire. Though some analysts see Fiat, Italy's
biggest private company, as a potential recovery stock, its short-term
prospects look grim and Ifil's investment seems odd.
Unprejudiced consideration of its policy is complicated by Ifil's historical
role as a strongbox for the Agnellis and an instrument in broader family or
Fiat-related transactions.
Many observers recall the 1986 manoeuvrings when cash-rich Ifil was used in
a complex ballet to buy out the Libyan government, then a minority
shareholder in Fiat.
Mr Gabriele Galateri di Genola, Ifil's managing director, sees things
differently. Ifil's decision not just to subscribe to Fiat's rights issue,
but raise its stake to 12.6 per cent from 9.26 per cent, 'comes down to
whether you think it's a good investment or not', he says.
Displaying the charm and acumen which many believe will drive him to the top
of Fiat, he argues that any investor not convinced about the car company's
future should sell out. Mr Galateri argues that Fiat, expected to announce a
large loss in 1993 and pass its dividend, has strong recovery potential. The
rights issue represents a bargain.
Drawing attention to the convertible bond which accompanied the rights
issue, he rejects criticisms that the cars group represents a poor
short-term investment. The 2 per cent coupon on the bond offers a very
reasonable return and Ifil has entered the group of core investors expected
to play an active role in Fiat's future, he argues.
Mr Galateri is more convincing when it comes to Rinascente. While some
analysts have attacked the deal - in which Fiat shareholders were invited to
buy the group's 46.8 per cent Rinascente stake - many agree there could be
advantages in bringing Ifil and the retailer together.
Ifil has expanded in food production after a stream of takeovers of leading
Italian companies since the mid-1980s. More recently, it has sold many
acquisitions to BSN, the big French foods group, in return for cash, an
equity stake of almost 6 per cent and a commitment to develop joint food
interests.
It is the food-retailing combination which lies at the heart of the
Rinascente deal. The latter is an odd collection of businesses, comprising
flagship city-centre department stores, the SMA supermarkets and
hypermarkets chain and the struggling Upim variety stores.
SMA, and especially its growing list of greenfield hypermarkets, is the most
attractive component. Italian retailing has been undergoing a belated
transformation in recent years as thousands of small, city centre outlets
have made way for more big supermarkets. Although the mix between small and
large food stores is heavily weighted towards the former, the big outlets
are expected to dominate in the end.
Because of the complexities of Italy's new takeover laws, Ifil has limited
its Rinascente share to 33 per cent to avoid triggering a compulsory
takeover. That will gradually increase, as bourse rules allow it to raise
its holding by 3 per cent a year, although Mr Galateri declines a final
target.
Not that there is any threat to its control. The complex change of hands
from Fiat has meant that bank underwriters, likely to be sympathetic to
Ifil, have been left with a large portion of Rinascente stock on their
books. Arab Banking Corporation and Pictet, the Geneva-based private bank,
have bought stakes, estimated at around 6 per cent and 2 per cent, in the
retailer respectively. Both are close to Ifil.
The Ifil-Rinascente link may be purely defensive. If, as some observers
expect, Italian retailing moves towards the UK model, where big supermarket
chains tend to have the upper hand over suppliers, then adding retail
distribution to Ifil's food production portfolio could be a bonus. But the
deal's main appeal may be in the wider context of changes in Italian food
retailing.
As part of its privatisation policy, the government plans to sell GS, the
big state-controlled supermarket and hypermarket chain. A number of
contenders have thrown their hats into the ring, although the timing and
details of the disposal are unclear.
Mr Galateri is unwilling to be drawn on Ifil's plans. Some observers suspect
that buying Rinascente - while beneficial to Fiat - may be a first step in a
more ambitious Ifil strategy.
Combining Rinascente's food retailing with another big network, such as GS,
would create a large force in the highly fragmented Italian market. If the
Rinascente-GS duo could be beefed up with minority participations from other
leading retailers, in the UK or Germany, it could make a winning
combination.

The Austrian government plans to sell at least half of its 36.5 per cent
stake in Flughaven Wien, the Vienna airport company, as soon as possible,
the finance ministry said yesterday.
Flughaven Wien was partially privatised in 1992 with the sale of 27 per cent
of its share capital. The City of Vienna and the Province of Lower Austria
each have 18.25 per cent stakes in the airport.
The privatisation will be either through a flotation on the stock exchange,
a direct sale to a trade buyer, or a combination of both, the official said.
Lazard Brothers of London are advisers, and a decision on the method of
privatisation will depend on market conditions and whether Lazard can find a
suitable foreign buyer, the official said.
Based on the current price of Vienna Airport shares of just under Sch600 per
nominal share of Sch100, the government could hope to raise around Sch2.2bn
(Dollars 185m) from the sale of 18.25 per cent of the company.

FT  11 JAN 94 / International Company News: Bidding dispute over Paramount

<TEXT>
The two protagonists in the Dollars 10bn takeover battle for Paramount
Communications became embroiled in a complex dispute over bidding procedures
yesterday, as QVC Network called on the Paramount board to declare the
latest offer from rival Viacom in violation of the rules and take
appropriate action.
QVC said it would await the action of the Paramount board, which is to
consider the Viacom offer tomorrow before deciding what action to take.
Observers said that if it did not win the support of the Paramount board,
QVC might go to the courts in an attempt to block the Viacom offer.
Viacom unveiled its new bid - as well as an Dollars 8.4bn merger agreement
with video rental company Blockbuster Entertainment - on Friday night,
shortly before the expiry of QVC's tender offer for 50.1 per cent of
Paramount's shares.
Viacom increased the value of its cash offer for 50.1 per cent of Paramount
to Dollars 105 a share, compared with QVC's Dollars 92, but it cut sharply
the value of the securities being offered for the remainder.
Traders said that Viacom's stock and shares offer for 100 per cent of
Paramount remained below QVC's offer.
QVC, which announced yesterday that its tender had attracted 26.8m Paramount
shares - more than 20 per cent of the total - argues that Viacom broke the
bidding rules by launching an offer inferior to the one it had on the table.
In spite of this, QVC yesterday extended its bid to January 21, the same
closing date as Viacom's latest tender, as it is required to do under the
bidding rules. There had been hints that QVC might try to close its bid
earlier than this.
Viacom argues that its current offer is superior to QVC's and it has fully
complied with the bidding procedures.

FT  11 JAN 94 / International Company News: State to raise Dollars 1.4bn
from IMI sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN

<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Italian government stands to make up to L2,200bn (Dollars 1.4bn) by
selling part of its stake in Istituto Mobiliare Italiano, the latest
candidate on its privatisation list.
Mr Piero Barucci, the Treasury minister, said the state would roughly halve
its shareholding in IMI to about 30 per cent from just over 60 per cent.
The transaction, to start on January 31, involves the sale of 200m IMI
shares, representing one third of its capital. About 90 per cent of the
shares being sold are held directly or indirectly by the Treasury.
The pricing will be revealed on January 29. However, the Treasury has
indicated that shares vill be sold for between L9,800 and L11,000 each.
The majority of the issue will be reserved for institutional investors,
notably abroad. Some 35m shares will go to US institutions, 65m to other
foreign investors and 25m to Italian institutions. A further 75m shares are
being sold to private investors in Italy.
Mr Mario Draghi, the director general of the Treasury, who has been
overseeing the IMI sale for more than two years, justified the decision to
dispose of only half the state's stake for the time being.
With the privatisation of Credito Italiano barely completed and that of
Banca Commerciale Italiana coming immediately after IMI, the Treasury had to
be careful not to flood the market, he argued. The BCI deal starts on
February 28. The fact that the IMI privatisation is an initial public
offering, rather than the disposal of residual public-sector stock,
compelled caution, he said. Selling IMI shares in more than one tranche
could maximise receipts for the state.
IMI embraces long-term lending, fund management, securities trading and
insurance. It raised net profits to L376bn in the nine months to September
30 1993 from L275bn in the same period in 1992.

FT  11 JAN 94 / International Company News: Euro Disney banks may seek theme
park shake-up
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The Euro Disney banks may demand changes in the management and operation of
the EuroDisneyland theme park as part of the emergency financial
restructuring package for the troubled leisure group.
The banks are awaiting a review of Euro Disney that they commissioned last
month from the Paris office of KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy and
consulting group. Euro Disney, which lost FFr5.3bn (Dollars 898m) in the
year to September 30, is threatened by bankruptcy unless the banks agree to
a rescue package.
KPMG has been asked to audit Euro Disney's financial position and its
capital requirements. The preliminary version of this report, which will
form the basis of the banks' strategy in the restructuring talks with Euro
Disney and Walt Disney, its US parent company, is scheduled for completion
by the end of this week.
The banks have charged KPMG with analysing Euro Disney's business plan so
that the banks can decide whether changes will be required in the running of
the park and in its cost base. This report, which is expected to take longer
to finish than the financial audit, will be used to assess whether the banks
should ask for strategic or personnel changes to be made at Euro Disney.
'There is deep dissatisfaction among the banks as to the way that Disney has
managed Euro Disney,' said a banker involved with the negotiations. 'It is
possible that we may press for changes. We also have to be sure that the
cost base comes down. But nothing will be decided until KPMG has completed
its work.'
Walt Disney would be expected to resist any attempt by the banks to
influence the running of Euro Disney. It prides itself on its strong
corporate culture and was, until the Euro Disney debacle, regarded as one of
the most most successful companies in the US.
However the banks, which have been asked by Disney to exchange part of their
FFr20.3bn loans for equity as part of the restructuring package, are anxious
to protect their position.
Disney has implemented changes at Euro Disney since the park's opening in
April 1992. Many of the original US executives have been replaced by
Europeans. Mr Philippe Bourguignon, chairman, has overhauled Euro Disney's
policies for marketing, merchandising and pricing.

FT  11 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Thomas French pushes ahead to over Pounds
1m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The integration of British Tapes together with the disposal of lossmaker Kaz
Krafts enabled Thomas French &amp; Sons to record a rise in pre-tax profits from
Pounds 110,000 to Pounds 1.05m for the year to October 2.
The figure took account of abortive acquisition costs of Pounds 257,000.
Turnover of continuing businesses rose from Pounds 12.84m to Pounds 14.61m -
the Manchester-based group makes curtain tapes and window accessories.
Earnings worked through at 4.67p (0.19p). A proposed final dividend of
2.175p makes a maintained 3.625p total.
Year-end gearing was reduced from 40 per cent to 22 per cent.
Mr Michael Snapes, formerly managing director of Coral Holdings, has been
appointed chief executive. The move splits the role of Mr Jeremy French, who
continues as executive chairman.
Mr French said the sale by Marling Industries in November of a 22.8 per cent
stake to institutions should help share liquidity.

FT  11 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Hewlett-Packard UK at Pounds 83m -
Worldwide profits performance more than doubles to Dollars 1.2bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK subsidiary of Hewlett-Packard, the US-based computers and electronics
group, outperformed its parent last year with a Pounds 90m turnround in
pre-tax profits and a 43 per cent increase in turnover to more than Pounds
1bn.
Worldwide, HP reported profits of Dollars 1.2bn (Pounds 810m) in 1993, up
from Dollars 549m the previous year. Revenues rose 23 per cent to Dollars
20.3bn, making it the second largest computer manufacturer in the US and
easily the most profitable.
The UK subsidiary made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 82.6m compared with a
Pounds 7.4m loss the previous year. Mr John Golding, UK managing director,
played down the profit improvement pointing out that the figures reflected
internal accounting policy rather than trading performance.
He attached more importance to the growth in overall turnover, which reached
Pounds 1.02bn, and to a 50 per cent increase in exports to Pounds 324m.
Mr Golding said the company's performance was the result of quality
programmes, eliminating waste, consolidating operations and keeping expenses
under control.
During the year, HP bought Colorado Memory Systems (Europe) and BT&amp;D
Technologies, strengthening its activities in computer mass storage and in
telecommunications.
HP seems to have proved itself better able to ride out the recession and
turbulence in the global computer industry than other large computer
manufacturers.
It is, according to Mr Golding, profitable in all its product sectors
including computer systems, printers, calculators and electronic
instruments. It is strengthening its performance in personal computers and
is now the fourth largest pc vendor in Europe.

FT  11 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Treatt shares rise 13p on back of profits
jump
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares of Treatt, the USM-traded supplier, blender and distiller of
essential oils and aromatic chemicals, jumped 13p to 180p yesterday on news
of a 31 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 1.66m for the year
ended September 30 1993.
The improvement, from last time's Pounds 1.27m, was scored on a turnover
just 2 per cent ahead at Pounds 15.4m (Pounds 15.1m). Net margins, however,
jumped from 8.4 per cent to 10.8 per cent.
Earnings rose to 12.27p (9.37p) and a proposed final dividend of 2.9p lifts
the total dividend to 4p (3.6p).
Mr Geoffrey Bovrill, chairman, said the US offshoot, Florida Treatt, made
its first operating profit and was proving to be an important outlet for the
sale of RC Treatt's products, particularly its specialities and natural
chemicals.
Florida Treatt was formed in 1990 to manufacture natural orange juice
aromas. The main products are used to improve the aroma of concentrated
orange juice which loses some flavour components during production. Its
turnover rose by about 50 per cent over the 1992-93 year and the customer
base substantially expanded.
Overall, Suffolk-based Treatt has a basic range of over 100 different
essential oils. Its customers include flavour and fragrance creators as well
as manufacturers of soft drinks, food, confectionery, pharmaceuticals, soap
and detergents.
A substantial potion of turnover consists of export sales.

Nobo Group, the office and business products supplier, reported more than
doubled pre-tax profits for the six months to October 31 in 'difficult
trading conditions'.
Pre-tax profits were Pounds 965,000 (Pounds 403,000) on turnover of Pounds
10.6m (Pounds 10.2m). The improvement was boosted by the restating of the
comparable figure for FRS 3. Turnover, adjusted for the effects of the sale
of Budgie Office Products and the purchase of Elite Optics, a maker of
overhead projectors, advanced by 5 per cent.
Earnings per share came out at 5.55p (2.05p) and the interim dividend is

FT  11 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Management deal secures independence of
Epicure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Epicure, the 100-year-old grocery brand, will remain part of an independent
company following a Pounds 10.5m deal announced yesterday, writes Nigel
Clark
Petty Wood, the family-owned food distributor which owns the brand, is being
bought by its management.
Mr Jonathan Russell of 3i, which is backing the deal, said: 'This is a
classic case of resolving a succession issue within an old established
family business by uniting ownership with management.
The company was founded in 1816 and the shares have passed through several
generations. In 1989 a new management team came in, since when there has
been little family involvement in the day-to-day activities.
Finance for the deal, which includes working capital, is provided by a
syndicate led by 3i and including Lloyds Development Capital and NatWest
Ventures.
Mr Peter Hopkins, managing director, said the buy-out would enable the
company's expansion programme to continue. 'The sense of family unity has
been a great asset to the company in the past but it is now time to move
Petty Wood forward.'
Over the last three years the company, based in Andover, Hampshire, has
expanded to bring in other leading brands as well as Epicure. These include
Melitta Coffee, Jordans cereals and Baxters of Speyside.
It supplies prestige outlets such as Fortnum &amp; Mason and Harrods as well as
independent retailers. Turnover for 1993 is expected to be more than Pounds
20m.

FT  11 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Rising markets lift Aberdeen Trust profits
79% to Pounds 3.1m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Aberdeen Trust, the fast expanding fund management and accountancy services
group, yesterday reported a 79 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to
Pounds 3.1m for the year to September 30.
Turnover, from management fees on its many unit and investment trusts, and
from accountancy services, was up 32 per cent to Pounds 14.7m (Pounds
11.1m).
The group, which was floated on the Stock Exchange in 1991, had Pounds 2.2bn
under management on December 31 1993, spread across 14 investment trusts, 20
unit trusts, as well as institutional and private individuals' funds.
Most of the trusts carry the Abtrust label. The company specialises in east
Asian stock markets and in smaller UK companies.
Mr Martin Gilbert, chief executive, said the improved profit was due partly
to the fact that world stock markets had done well in 1993 and to success in
raising new funds, while the group had reduced its operating costs.
Additional funds worth Pounds 140m were committed to the group's investment
trusts during the calendar year, representing 5 per cent of all funds raised
for UK investment trusts during the year.
He believed the full benefits of reducing overheads and increasing funds
under management would flow through in the current financial year.
Operating profits jumped from Pounds 2.2m to Pounds 4m but interest charges
doubled to Pounds 1m as a result of a transaction in 1992 with Century Life.
A proposed final dividend of 1p makes an unchanged 1.5p total. Earnings per
share were 61 per cent higher at 2.46p (1.53p) after allowing for
reorganisation costs of Pounds 600,000 incurred in the first half.

FT  11 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Kleinwort's EPIT trust raises Pounds 320m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kleinwort Benson's European Privatisation Investment Trust has raised about
Pounds 320m from institutions during the pre-placement period, making it
likely to be the second largest UK investment trust launch ever, and the
largest trust in Kleinwort's stable.
The public offer period, which starts today and closes on February 2, could
take the fund up to a total of as much as Pounds 400m.
Kleinwort originally announced that the fund aimed to raise Pounds 40m.
The largest investment trust launch was the Mercury World Mining Trust last
November, raising a total of Pounds 426m.
The offer price for EPIT is 100p, with 50 per cent due immediately and the
remainder six months later, to allow staggered investment of the funds.
There will be one warrant attached to every five shares, and the minimum
investment is Pounds 2,000.
The trust will initially buy shares in companies privatised within the last
five years, following the principle that most efficiency gains are realised
within five years of privatisation. These will be sold, or money borrowed,
to participate in new privatisation issues as they come up.
Up to 20 per cent of the fund will be invested in former Warsaw pact
countries, and up to 20 per cent in the UK. But the main emphasis will be on
European Union member countries apart from the UK. France, Italy and Spain
all have large privatisation programmes planned.
Mercury Asset Management is launching a similar European privatisation
trust, but with a larger UK content.
Investment trusts provide a simple way for individuals to invest in
privatisations outside the UK as they avoid the need for foreign bank
accounts and currency exchange costs.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Mr Greg Hutchings, chief executive of Tomkins, said yesterday he was 'very
excited and very optimistic for the future'. He said the 15.2 per cent
increase in the interim dividend was 'very bullish'. He predicted the group
would continue to generate earnings and dividend growth above the average
for the stock market.
Mr Hutchings said Tomkins, which acquired Ranks Hovis McDougall, the food
group, in December for Pounds 990.5m, would not rewrite its 10-year-old
mission statement just because it was out of fashion with the stock market.
The integration of RHM was going to schedule.
At the half-year end net cash was Pounds 170m, which, Mr Hutchings said,
provided the resources to finance recovery, although at present he could see
'very few signs of recovery in the UK and continental Europe'.

FT  11 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Europa merger delayed until after March 14
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The three-way merger first proposed six months ago involving Europa
Minerals, a small London-quoted finance house, and Burmine and Austmin Gold,
two Australian companies with which it is already closely involved, will not
be able to take place until after March 14.
Mount Edon Gold, another Australian group which has made a rival bid for
Burmine, is appealing against a decision of the Australian Supreme Court
and, consequently, the Australian Administrative Appeals Tribunal has
ordered Burmine not to put any resolution to its shareholders to approve the
three-way merger until after a hearing on that date.
Mount Edon is appealing against an ASC decision preventing Mount Edon from
voting its 22.6 per cent stake in Burmine when the three-way merger comes up
for shareholder approval.
Burmine, for its part, has also appealed against the ASC decision, claiming
that the proposed merger should not be conditional on shareholder approval
at all.
The Mount Edon offer for Burmine is due to expire on January 21. The contest
is made even more complex by the fact that Mount Edon also has a 19.9 per
cent shareholding in Europa while Europa already owns 38.5 per cent of
Burmine and Austmin holds 19.8 per cent of Europa.
Henry Ansbacher, the UK merchant bank, owns 12.8 per cent of Europa.

FT  11 JAN 94 / UK Company News: W Midlands Travel in slow lane
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
West Midlands Travel, the largest bus operator in the Midlands which was
bought by its employees from the local authorities in December 1991, made
pre-tax profits of Pounds 9.6m for the year to March 1993 on turnover of
Pounds 150m.
The results, announced to the employees last weekend, were little changed
from the preceding year - eight months of which were in public ownership -
when pre-tax profits were Pounds 9.8m on turnover of Pounds 149m.
Mr Don Colston, chief executive, expects the pre-tax figure for the year to
March 1994 to be little changed again at around Pounds 10m.
The 1991 buyout, which cost Pounds 72m, was financed solely by debt.
Half of this sum has now been repaid, Mr Colston said.
Debt repayments have been absorbing cashflow and he noted that funds would
have to be found 'in the not too distant future' for investment in the bus
fleet.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Barrow Hepburn, a wholly-owned subsidiary of BTP, the specialist chemical
company, returned pre-tax profits of Pounds 7.32m for the half year ended
September 30.
That compared with Pounds 4.52m previously and was struck from a turnover of
Pounds 90.56m (Pounds 64.6m). Acquisitions added Pounds 10m to turnover and
Pounds 1.53m to operating profits. Earnings amounted to 11.88p (7.37p).
The results were included in BTP's results for the half year to September
30.

FT  11 JAN 94 / UK Company News: US behind rise at Ellis &amp; Everard
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ellis &amp; Everard, the chemicals distributor, yesterday reversed the downward
trend of recent years with a better than expected 31 per cent jump in
interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 6.5m to Pounds 8.5m.
From earnings per share for the six months to October 31 ahead by 31 per
cent to 7.2p (5.5p) the interim dividend is being raised by 9 per cent to
2.45p (2.25p).
The profits rise was fuelled by a stronger dollar and an underlying recovery
in volume and margins, particularly in the US. Group turnover was 11 per
cent higher at Pounds 211.5m (Pounds 190.1m).
Mr Peter Wood, chief executive, said Ellis, which has suffered in the last
two years due to recession and unsuccessful diversification, had spent the
last 12 months sorting out 'a lot of problem areas'.
These included the previously lossmaking Spanish operation which had been
merged with a separate company in March, leaving Ellis with an 11 per cent
stake, and the pools chemicals distributor, acquired in 1990.
The pools business suffered a Pounds 100,000 loss, but Mr Wood said
rationalisation left him hopeful of an improvement next year. The Spanish
activity, now included as an associate, contributed profits of Pounds
100,000.
The good news came from the US, where operating profits rose by 27 per cent
in dollar terms to Dollars 7.1m (Dollars 5.6m) on sales 3 per cent ahead to
Dollars 182.9m (Dollars 177.5m). Exchange rates contributed Pounds 500,000
to pre-tax profits.
Mr Wood said the US businesses had benefited from improved buying power and
rationalisation. This helped overcome weak chemical prices, down by about 8
per cent. In the UK operating profits were 13 per cent higher to Pounds 5.3m
(Pounds 4.7m) on sales 6.5 per cent up to Pounds 77.1m (Pounds 72.4m).
Ellis also announced the Pounds 1.2m acquisition of Ronmar Plastics, a
distributor of polymers for Du Pont. Mr Wood said that the purchase, along
with two long-term distribution and packaging contracts also announced
yesterday, would be 'producing meaningful numbers' by 1994-95.
COMMENT
The shares rose just 4p on the results to 241p, reflecting the company's
determination to rein in any over-excitement. Mr Wood warned that while the
second half gave no cause for concern so far, the first half's success did
not imply any departure from the normal trading pattern of 55 per cent of
the year's profits in the first six months and 45 per cent in the second.
Nevertheless these were good results, and the deals announced yesterday show
Ellis is following a sensible longer-term strategy. Full-year forecasts are
for between Pounds 15.5m and Pounds 16m. The prospective p/e of 18 leaves
Ellis with events looking up in the short term. However, longer-term punters
are likely to be tempted by the yield and a substantially more attractive
outlook next year.

Holders of Queens Moat Houses' two debenture stocks yesterday formed a
steering committee to negotiate with the hotel company over terms of its
refinancing.
At a meeting there was a unanimous vote in favour of the move, which was
described as helpful by the company, its advisers and the trustee to the
stocks.
QMH is in talks with its bankers and other lenders over a Pounds 1.3bn
refinancing. The debenture stocks are secured on assets but last November
holders agreed to waive their right to enforce their security. The value of
the security has fallen to below the nominal value of the two stocks, which
total Pounds 215m.
Yesterday, holders representing 81.77 per cent of the two stocks voted
either at the meeting or by proxy. The committee includes Legal &amp; General,
Sun Life Assurance, Standard Life, Norwich Union, Equitable Life and Eagle
Star Life. These six investors hold 53 per cent of the two stocks.

FT  11 JAN 94 / UK Company News: AG Barr declines by 32% to Pounds 4.1m in
trade 'horror story'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Profits at AG Barr, the Glasgow-based soft drinks company which manufactures
Irn-Bru and Tizer, fell 32 per cent before tax in the 52 weeks to October
30.
The decline to Pounds 4.07m (Pounds 5.97m) was struck on turnover down at
Pounds 87.9m (Pounds 94.7m). The shares slipped 5p to 305p.
Mr Robin Barr, chairman, said that trading in the year had been 'extremely
disappointing'. He said that the summer had been 'one of the worst for many
years' with sales in the first week of June down 44 per cent on last time.
He also blamed the declines in profits and turnover on increases in sugar
prices since the UK left the ERM - they were up 18 per cent in February,
falling to 12 per cent in August - and a 'softening of prices' in the
group's non-branded products. While a branded two litre bottle cost 99p, an
own-label product has often been reduced from 59p to 45p, and the prices of
commodity tertiary brands have fallen to as little as 26p for two litres.
In addition, last time's figures were for 53 weeks and included an
exceptional profit of Pounds 409,000 from the sale of the stake in Taveners,
the sugar confectionery maker.
However, Mr Barr said he was pleased with 'the way we moved within the
trade, even if the trade itself was a horror story'.
Sales of Barr's brands, which account for about 90 per cent of group
turnover, rose 4 per cent, helped by increased marketing budgets for Irn-Bru
and Tizer. In the other flavours segment of the UK carbonates market Irn-Bru
lifted its market share from 7.9 to 9.2 per cent.
The interest bill was sharply reduced to Pounds 591,000 (Pounds 1.07m) and
Mr Barr expects that to fall further in the current year, in spite of
anticipated capital expenditure costs of between Pounds 4.5m and Pounds 5m,
against Pounds 4.1m in the period under review.
The final dividend is held at 4.75p for an unchanged 6.5p total, payable
from earnings down at 15.51p (21.57p) per share.

FT  11 JAN 94 / UK Company News: New betting head is appointed to Ladbroke
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ladbroke yesterday unveiled the first of what are expected to be several
senior management appointments when it announced that Mr Mike Smith, a
director of Bowater, is to head its betting and gaming division.
Mr Smith, 47, will also sit on the Ladbroke main board. He is expected to
take up his appointment at the end of May.
Ladbroke said last Friday that Mr Cyril Stein, who headed the group for
nearly four decades, would not stay on as a non-executive director.
The announcement was seen as a attempt to ensure a fresh start for Mr John
Jackson and Mr Peter George, who took over as chairman and chief executive
respectively at the beginning of the month.
Ladbroke is also expected to announce a new chief executive for its Hilton
International hotels subsidiary. The group, whose other interests are
do-it-yourself retail outlets and property, said last year that it was
talking to Mr Michael Hirst, the current head of Hilton, about his future.
These discussions were still going on.
Mr Smith held senior positions in the car industry before moving to Grand
Metropolitan in 1984.

FT  11 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Tiphook disposal may raise over Pounds 700m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tiphook, the transport leasing group, is expected to announce soon the
disposal of its container business to Transamerica, the US financial
services group, for a figure in excess of Pounds 700m.
Shares in Tiphook yesterday fell 6p to 72p after weekend reports that the
groups had yet to settle details of the disposal, which was first announced
in November.
The initial purchase price announced was Pounds 830m, a much higher figure
than analysts had believed to be obtainable. The price has been reduced
following due diligence by Transamerica, which is now complete, but a figure
over Pounds 700m would still substantially reduce Tiphook's borrowings of
about Pounds 1.2bn.
Tiphook has said it intends to retain the group's other activities -
including its fleet of 25,065 truck trailers, the biggest fleet in Europe -
which it believes will be capable of servicing the remaining debt.
The publication of Tiphook's December capacity utilisation figures, due
today will be delayed until the container disposal is complete. Shareholders
will be given details of the group's structure and future trading strategies
before the end of the month.

FT  11 JAN 94 / UK Company News: BAT to merge fund management activities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BAT Industries said yesterday that it was merging the fund management
operations of its two insurance companies, Eagle Star and Allied Dunbar,
into a new company reflecting what it sees as fundamental changes in the
financial services industry.
Mr George Greener, chief executive of BAT's UK Financial Services, said: 'We
believe fundamental change has already taken place in the financial services
industry.'
One of the objectives of the new company, to be known as Threadneedle Asset
Management, will be to increase BAT's asset management for third parties,
particularly pension funds.
'I believe the days of distribution-led business are finished. We want to
improve our image in the marketplace and improve our performance,' Mr
Greener said. 'We need to be transparent to independent financial advisers
and to external clients.'
New rules taking effect in January 1995 will require life insurance
companies to tell prospective customers much more about the charges for each
policy and how much each sales agent is paid in commission.
Mr Greener believed that superior investment performance would do much more
to enhance sales than the expansion of the sales force which has been the
traditional route through which life insurers have gained market share.
BAT intends to retain its two insurance brands and will not seek to merge
Allied Dunbar with Eagle Star.
There will also be a separate unit to manage property investments.
Mr Greener also said that in BAT's repositioning effort, it was also looking
at acquisitions. He declined to be drawn on the type of acquisition except
to say: 'I have always been interested in the concept of bancassurance.'
Mr Greener said he does not expect any significant redundancies to result
from the merger. However, rationalisation of back office activities could
pare expenses by 10 per cent to 20 per cent over the medium term.
The two companies between them have 60 fund managers and broadly similar
investment approaches.

FT  11 JAN 94 / RHM helps Tomkins double profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tomkins, the industrial group, nearly doubled interim pre-tax profits, from
Pounds 47.1m to Pounds 93.8m, with the help of Ranks Hovis McDougall, the
food group acquired for Pounds 990.5m in December 1992.
Mr Greg Hutchings, chief executive, said the rise in profits was achieved in
spite of difficult trading conditions, with few signs of recovery in Europe.
At the operating level, RHM contributed profits of Pounds 38.5m to a total
of Pounds 85.9m, with milling and baking making Pounds 7.1m of that. Concern
over intense competition in the baking industry has led Tomkins' shares to
underperform since the acquisition.
Mr Hutchings was upbeat yesterday about prospects, but the shares fell 3p to
259p. Since acquiring RHM, 22 facilities had been closed and 2,860
redundancies made, cutting the workforce by 11 per cent.
Tomkins used Pounds 12.3m of the Pounds 90.4m provisions set up at the time
of acquisition in the six months to October 30. About Pounds 69m was left,
which would be needed over the next 12 to 18 months.
Spending on advertising had been increased by Pounds 8m to support brands
such as Mr Kipling's cakes, Hovis bread and Sharwoods ethnic foods, which
had been neglected by the old management. New products had been launched,
such as sun-dried tomato bread for Marks and Spencer. Mr Hutchings said the
bread market was no more competitive than, for example, the lawnmower market
in the US.
Mr Ian Duncan, finance director, said Tomkins' operating profits, excluding
RHM, rose from Pounds 39m to Pounds 47.4m, with about Pounds 4m due to the
fall in sterling against the dollar. The group had hedged dollar profits for
the current year at Dollars 1.59 which compared with a rate of Dollars 1.76
for 1992-93.
Profits from North America rose 71 per cent to Pounds 50.1m. Mr Hutchings
said this demonstrated the group's operational gearing, where a rise in
volume led to a sharper rise in profits.
However, in some divisions margins fell as competition was still fierce. Mr
Duncan said that, for instance, at Murray Ohio, the US lawnmowers and
bicycles business, higher volumes had been gained at the expense of lower
margins.
He said the group's net cash had risen to Pounds 169.8m at the end of the
half-year, up from Pounds 120.6m on May 1. But with interest rates low, cash
was 'our worst performing asset'. Interest receivable fell from Pounds 6.3m
to Pounds 4.6m.
After tax, earnings per share rose 23.2 per cent to 5.53p fully diluted. The
interim dividend goes up from 1.805p to 2.08p.
Mr Hutchings said the group had increased interim earnings per share by
three times the market average over the last 10 years and the dividend at 2
1/2 times the average.

FT  11 JAN 94 / Scandal pushes rock-like imageto the edge: Patrick Harverson
explains how Prudential Securities is being hit by investors' claims
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Prudential Securities agreed to pay Dollars 371m (Pounds 250m) in fines
and restitution to settle charges that it defrauded hundreds of thousands of
investors who bought high-risk limited partnerships from its brokers in the
1980s, the Wall Street firm thought the worst of the scandal was over. Mr
Hardwick Simmons, chief executive, said of the settlement three months ago:
'It's one last punch. The eye already got blackened.'
In the past fortnight, however, the firm received another black eye when Mr
Loren Schechter, its general counsel, was forced to resign. Mr Schechter,
the firm's chief legal officer for more than 11 years, was ousted after it
was reported that the US attorney's office in Manhattan was investigating
the legal department's role in vetting sales documents used in connection
with the partnerships.
Over the next few months several former and current executives, including Mr
George Ball, former chief executive, as well as Mr Schechter, are expected
to be issued with subpoenas by government investigators seeking more
information on the case.
Mr Ball's career has continued to suffer - last October he resigned from a
top post at another Wall Street brokerage, Smith Barney Shearson, amid
speculation that he was asked to go because of the publicity surrounding the
limited partnerships case.
Other indications that the issue has yet to run its course include the
prospect that senior executives at the firm in the 1980s will be charged by
the Securities and Exchange Commission with failing to supervise properly
the brokers selling the partnerships, and the recent naming of Prudential
Insurance, the firm's parent company - and two accounting firms Arthur
Andersen and Deloitte &amp; Touche - in lawsuits involving the limited
partnerships.
The investigation of wrongdoing at Prudential Securities has implications
beyond the firm. The publicity surrounding it has come at a bad time for the
US brokerage industry, which has been trying to fend off accusations that it
was lax in preventing 'rogue brokers' from taking advantage of investors
through unscrupulous trading practices. The longer the Prudential Securities
affair drags on, the harder it will be for Wall Street to convince investors
that its brokers can be trusted.
The problems plaguing Prudential Securities, the fourth largest firm in the
industry, date back to the early 1980s, when brokers at Prudential-Bache
Securities, as the firm was then called, sold about Dollars 8bn of highly
speculative limited partnerships in property, oil and gas investments to
about 400,000 clients.
Although the clients say they had been assured the investments were safe, by
the end of the decade the high-risk investments had soured amid the collapse
of the property and energy markets. Investors were left with billions of
dollars in losses. By the start of the 1990s, thousands of clients had
launched lawsuits against Prudential Securities, claiming they had been
defrauded by brokers who had misled them about the partnerships' risks and
returns. So far, only a few class-action lawsuits on behalf of several
thousand investors have been settled, at a cost to the firm of Dollars 270m.
Prudential Insurance's public image - built upon the advertising slogan
'Solid as a Rock' - has been tarnished by the events, partly because many
investors said they bought the partnerships as they trusted the Prudential
name.
The parent company has also been named in several class-action lawsuits
which claim the insurer was part of a racketeering conspiracy involving the
sale of the partnerships. Government investigators are also looking into
allegations that insurance agents at the parent company bypassed rules that
prohibited them from selling partnerships and other securities.
Prudential Insurance's debt rating might even be lowered because of the
events. Last month the insurance ratings agency AM Best was considering
downgrading the rating from A-double plus, its highest grade, because of
uncertainty surrounding the financial implications of the partnerships
affair.
Ultimately, the biggest cost will be in dollars. To date, the firm has
agreed to pay a total of Dollars 641m to settle SEC charges and class-action
lawsuits. The funds will come out of the Dollars 700m Prudential Securities
has set aside in reserves to cover such costs.
Under the terms of last October's SEC settlement, the firm is obliged to
meet the claims of any of the 400,000 clients who bought the limited
partnerships who can convince lawyers that they were defrauded.
Industry analysts estimate that the firm will need to come up with hundreds
of millions of dollars more. Mr Perrin Long, analyst at First of Michigan,
says: 'My guess is the final bill will be at least Dollars 1bn.' The firm
has admitted the Dollars 700m will grow to at least Dollars 800m.
The only good news for Prudential Securities is that all this has come at a
time when it can afford the huge costs. If it had erupted in the late 1980s,
when the securities industry was struggling, it might have broken the firm.
Today, however, Wall Street is entering the fourth year of boom, and
Prudential Securities has thrived. Yet, the scandal has ruined what should
have been the best years in the firm's history.
While every other big securities firm has been basking in record profits,
Prudential Securities admits it has had to put aside a dollar in its
reserves for every dollar of earnings.

FT  11 JAN 94 / Christmas sales up 11% for Signet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Signet, the jewellery group formerly known as Ratners, defied rumours
circulating last month of poor Christmas trading to announce an 11 per cent
sales increase in December.
Mr James McAdam, chairman and chief executive, said the rise in
like-for-like sales - excluding store openings and closures - in the crucial
Christmas period and a 6 per cent like-for-like increase for the 11 months
to December 31, meant Signet was likely to return to profit after a Pounds
40.1m loss last year. Signet shares gained 3 1/2 p to 31p.
Mr McAdam said the group had maintained the improved gross margin of about
57 per cent achieved in 1992.
'We didn't break ranks and start discounting,' he said. 'The sale didn't
start until after Christmas.'
That, combined with a further reduction in operating costs of about Pounds
30m, in addition to Pounds 50m the previous year, was 'driving the bottom
line hard'. Most analysts are forecasting pre-tax profits of Pounds 1m to
Pounds 2m for the year to January 29, although restoration of the dividend
is unlikely for some time.
The group performance was boosted by a strong showing by its Sterling chain
in the US, which now accounts for 55 per cent of group turnover, and 928 of
its 1,645 jewellery outlets. Sales were up 19 per cent on the previous
December, compared with single-digit rises among most competitors.
In the UK, like-for-like jewellery sales were up 6 per cent in December,
including a 12 per cent rise at Ernest Jones, and 5 per cent at H Samuel.
But sales in the Ratners chain, which now comprises only 100 stores, were
flat. Mr McAdam said the chain would shrink to 60 stores by the middle of
this year, through further conversion of Ratners stores into the H Samuel
format. Ratners stores already converted have enjoyed sales increases of
about 20 per cent.
The remaining 60 stores will be converted to a new format, and may be
renamed. Mr Mc-Adam said the format was likely to be based heavily on
experience gained from 'very encouraging' tests of trial outlets, called
Equa, in Swindon, Norwich and Peterborough.
The 186 Salisburys handbags, luggage and fashion accessories stores
continued to perform badly, with sales down 24 per cent in December. Signet
said a new management was looking at ways of turning the business round.

FT  11 JAN 94 / Frenchman tipped as Eurotunnel chief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Georges-Christian Chazot, a French industrialist with experience of the
service sector, has emerged as the leading candidate to take over as group
chief executive of Eurotunnel, the operator of the Channel rail link.
Eurotunnel said it expected to make an announcement concerning a new group
chief executive either this week or next week. The new appointee is expected
to take over from Sir Alastair Morton, who currently acts as chief executive
and who would revert to his position as co-chairman, along with Mr Andre
Benard.
Eurotunnel is keen to install a chief executive before commercial operations
start in March with freight services. Passenger services will start after
the official opening of the tunnel, due on May 6. Tariffs will be announced
today.
Mr Chazot, 54, worked until the beginning of this month at Adia, the Swiss
temporary employment group, where he was in charge of French operations.
During his 18-month stint, he helped reorganise the company's French
employment agencies.
Most of his career has been in industry. He has worked at several industrial
groups, including Alcatel, the Paris-based telecommunications group. He held
a number of positions, including heading its business systems division.
Before that he was chairman of Saft, Alcatel's batteries subsidiary.
Mr Chazot has a degree in electrical engineering and a diploma in marketing.
His appointment would tilt the balance of the board in favour of France.
Currently, it comprises seven Britons, seven Frenchmen, one Belgian and one
American.
One Paris banker involved in the Eurotunnel project welcomed Mr Chazot's
candidacy. 'He has experience of working in international companies and
seems to have a good technical background,' he said.
The new appointee will take over in the wake of a series of positive
developments at Eurotunnel. Last week, the company obtained approval from
its banks to raise an extra Pounds 1bn in funding which is necessary to
complete the project. The funding is expected to be divided equally between
a rights issue and a further Pounds 500m of bank loans.
Eurotunnel has also resolved legal disputes with the French and British
governments.

FT  11 JAN 94 / Investigation to start into Metallgesellschaft's ex-boss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER and CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Frankfurt prosecutor's office has launched a formal investigation into
Mr Heinz Schimmelbusch, the former chief executive of the troubled
Metallgesellschaft group, and former finance director Mr Meinhard Forster.
Ms Hildegarde Becker-Toussaint, spokeswoman for the office, said the
investigation would focus on suspicion of fraud and failure to inform the
supervisory board of developments.
Metallgesellschaft refused to comment on the investigation yesterday, nor on
press reports that Mr Schimmelbusch, a 49-year-old Austrian, had misused
company funds. If formal charges were brought as a result of the
investigation, the former executives could face fines or up to 10 years in
jail.
The investigation, initiated after a complaint from a Metallgesellschaft
shareholder, follows the sacking of the two executives last month after the
group encountered serious liquidity difficulties arising from its activities
on the US oil futures market.
Since then the scale of the problems afflicting the Frankfurt-based metals
and mining group, has escalated. Last week Mr Kajo Neukirchen, the new chief
executive, revealed that losses in the year to September amounted to DM1.8bn
(Pounds 700m) - five times those originally reported.
The group's bankers and shareholders have been given until tomorrow night to
support a DM2.7bn injection of new equity capital. The group's bank
creditors were told yesterday that they were expected to extend DM700m of
new credit to the company - DM200m more than the figure mentioned at last
week's crisis meeting.
Mr Gunter Rexrodt, German economics minister, urged bank creditors and
shareholders to support a swift restructuring. He said this would secure
jobs and avoid unnecessary tensions on international metals markets.
It is likely the 100-plus banks involved will accept the refinancing. There
is unhappiness among non-German banks over the lack of time for considering
the plans and the rigidity of the proposals.

FT  11 JAN 94 / Historic city centre faces flood: Chichester prepares for
the worst as further rain is forecast
</HEADLINE>

   CHICHESTER
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
They were preparing for the worst in Chichester's elegant County Hall last
night as the River Lavant threatened to burst its banks and flood the
historic centre of the West Sussex city.
There was the distinct air of a war bunker in three basement rooms as county
council officials and exhausted firefighters awaited the arrival of the main
bulk of a 150-strong force of army engineers, junior government minister Mr
Charles Wardle and 150,000 sandbags.
Scientists and officials from the National Rivers Authority fought for wall
space for their charts showing river levels and river flows. Chichester, the
county town of West Sussex with a population of 20,000, is an unlikely place
to be in what resembles a state of siege, with its beautiful cathedral,
half-timbered coffee shops and pleasant Georgian architecture.
The River Lavant has never caused much trouble in the past. Now, the city's
eastern fringes have been flooded, though not seriously so. But the fear is
that further rain before the weekend could cause the breakdown of a culvert
running beneath the city centre and bring flooding in the heart of the city.
And the weather forecast is for more rain tomorrow.
Efforts are going on round the clock to shore up the river at the eastern
fringes and late yesterday 85 members of the fire brigade were hard at work
there, using sandbags and mud.
Parts of the town centre have been ripped up to make way for pipes which are
decanting 4.5m gallons of water a day from the Lavant into the sea at
Fishbourne Bay, three miles to the south of the city. Several Green
Goddesses - venerable army fire engines - are being used as part of this
operation. However, officials say this may not be enough.
One of the first things Lt Col Robbie Burns, in command of the contingent
from the 36th Engineers Regiment, will have to decide is whether to build
temporary bridges where sections of the A27 and the A259 are under water to
enable traffic to get through. The engineers will also look at ways of
drawing off more water from the Lavant.

FT  11 JAN 94 / Railtrack chief set to resist track ownership by operators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR and ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Bob Horton, chairman of Railtrack, yesterday launched a strong defence of
his organisation's role as owner of British Rail's track and signalling.
He gave a clear indication that he would strongly resist any attempt by
train operators to own track by spelling out the benefits of separating
track from the operation of rail services.
In a speech to the Chartered Institute of Transport, Mr Horton also publicly
committed his company to privatisation - the Treasury favours early
privatisation of Railtrack.
Mr Horton said: 'There is no need for a commercially driven public sector
organisation to be subject to the full detailed panoply of nationalised
industry controls, simply because that is the norm. I believe that is now
clearly accepted by the government.'
He said the advantage of separating the track from the train operators would
prove considerable. He said the complexity of contractual relationships was
commonplace in industry.
He did not mention the Central Railway Group, which has been allowed to
negotiate the purchase of track, or the potential bidders for ScotRail,
which favour integration, but said there was no logic to such moves.
'There is no necessary logic in vertical integration even when there is a
high degree of mutual commercial dependence,' he said. 'The act of
separation will enable us to clarify responsibilities and calculate costs,
it will make it much easier to obtain value for money.'
He argued that separating track ownership from the operation of rail
services would give a clear commercial focus to railway activities.
Decisions on new track and signalling investment would be made only after
detailed analysis of the needs of potential customers.
Mr Horton also sent a clear signal that he hopes to expand rail services.
'We want to open up the network to as many new services, freight and
passenger, that operators want to provide.'
As part of Railtrack's commercial focus it will relate its charges to its
performance. If trains are delayed or cancelled because a driver is sick or
a locomotive fails, Railtrack would not seek to apportion blame but try to
find and agree an explanation to minimise the chances of it happening again.
The west coast main line, between London and Glasgow, which the government
hopes to modernise with Pounds 400m-Pounds 600m of private sector finance,
will serve as a benchmark for the new railway structure, Mr Horton said.
He said he was confident 'that by this time next year our plans will be
concrete and we will be engaging a consortium to carry out the work.'
Mr Horton also revealed that Railtrack would contract out maintainance work
to the private sector.

FT  11 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: National lottery
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is rather disconcerting to learn how deep the gambling instinct runs
among the great and the good of British business. Yesterday, another two
FT-SE 100 companies threw their names into the hat to be selected to run the
national lottery, bringing the total number of interested consortia to
eight. That level of interest alone suggests the bidding for the licence
will be fierce and the returns correspondingly meagre. The lottery's high
visibility will also ensure operators' profits are sliced to the bone.
Nevertheless, even margins of 1 to 2 per cent will appear attractive if the
lottery can generate revenues projected at anything between Pounds 2bn and
Pounds 6bn. The lottery will undoubtedly take a fair chunk of cash out of
the public's pockets. Combined with this April's tax increases, that could
lead to some marked shifts in consumer spending patterns. Spending on
discretionary items, such as chocolates, newspapers and slot machines may
suffer. That helps explain the interest of companies such as Cadbury
Schweppes and Rank, which have a clear defensive intent.
Those most at threat from the lottery are the pools companies. Littlewoods,
which is by far the biggest operator, is determined to fight the lottery
tooth and nail. But Ladbroke, which has less muscle, is trying to hedge its
bets. Whether the government will accept that Ladbroke can disinterestedly
run betting shops, football pools and the lottery simultaneously, however,
is a moot point.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Signet - the jewellery retailer which may always be better known as Ratners
 -is the latest high street group to lift the veil on Christmas trading. The
apparently patchy performance of stores' groups is partly due to the
unreliability of year on year comparisons. Dixons disappointed last week
because it had a barnstorming run with video games in 1992, but a miserable
time with the same product in 1993. Projecting retail spending trends from
the habits of a few million teenage telly addicts is clearly a dangerous
game.
Jewellery has similarly peculiar problems. Signet's sales in 1992 were much
lower because the company had abandoned the disastrous discounting of 1991.
Not surprisingly then, last Christmas's turnover was usefully higher than
1992, but the increase may well reflect the company's own recovery as much
as an improvement in the economy. Significantly, sales at the stricken
Ratners chain failed to improve.
Throughout 1993, reasonably buoyant retail sales statistics contrasted
strongly with the cries of pain from most retailers. The conclusion may be
that turnover was frequently bought at the expense of margins. Those with
strong brands and franchises have managed to profit, even under such tough
conditions, while those in a weaker position had to put up with spasmodic
discounting to move stocks. Since low inflation exposes price increases and
poor value, and supposing that consumers remain cost conscious, pressures on
high street margins seem likely to remain intense.

FT  11 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Tomkins
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The jury must still be out on Tomkins' purchase of RHM. Though interim
profits of Pounds 94m were a little higher than the market expected, that
mainly reflected the trend in the group's other businesses. The old RHM held
little surprise. Milling and baking contributed Pounds 7.1m, though it must
have been the main beneficiary of the Pounds 12.3m group spending against
provisions. Of course, Tomkins' supermarket customers would be asking
awkward questions if it had pushed bread margins sharply higher. As it is, a
further slog lies ahead, while the acquisition is made relatively less
attractive by the Pounds 17m increase in the provision for deferred tax.
Tomkins' balance sheet with net cash of nearly Pounds 170m is strong
compared with other conglomerates. Cash generation will not be quite so
impressive in the second half, when both utilisation of provisions and
capital expenditure will increase. Still, Tomkins can amply afford to
restructure RHM while conserving working capital resources for the upturn.
It could even gear up for an acquisition, if an opportunity arose.
The company must hope this flexibility encourages the market to accord it a
higher rating. Indeed, there is some prospect of out-performance, not least
because its high cover ratio puts Tomkins into the popular category of
companies able to offer real dividend growth. The trouble is that its cash
pile is also a drag at current interest rates. There would be more sense in
saving up for another acquisition if RHM had already proved a winner.

FT  11 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Regulation issue
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The creation of the Personal Investment Authority, the proposed
self-regulatory body for retail financial services, is starting to resemble
an elaborate game of chicken. Standard Life's decision to withdraw its
support amounts to a calculated gamble that government can be forced to
reconsider legislation and that the resulting statutory system of regulation
will be more agreeable than the PIA. With the Prudential already opposed to
self-regulation, the defection of a second large life insurer is certainly a
blow. Much depends on whether other companies think the opposition bandwagon
is worth climbing aboard, although that is unlikely to be clear until the
PIA prospectus is published next month.
If the PIA cannot command the support of the big life insurers, it is hard
to see how the two-tier system of regulation can survive. In theory,
Standard Life and Prudential could opt to be regulated directly by the
Securities and Investments Board instead. That would be another gamble,
since their relationship with the regulator would be antagonistic from the
outset. In practice, though, the SIB itself would probably find the position
untenable.
Such fragmentation would undermine the reasoning behind setting up the PIA
in the first place. Proposals for making the two-tier system work, presented
to government by SIB chairman Mr Andrew Large last May, centred on devolving
direct regulation away from SIB itself. In the meantime, government will
doubtless continue to reject legislation, for fear of giving scent of
victory to the PIA's opponents. If the companies stick to their guns, it may
have to think again.

John Gummer's celebration of the British capital - 'London, making the best

environment secretary ought to have had a word with his brother's public
relations firm when compiling the section on finance.
A picture entitled 'Bank dealing floor' is quite obviously no such thing.
Clearly visible in the background above the milling crowds of dealers is the
legend 'London International Financial Futures Exchange'. The bit on the
foreign exchange market also contains the puzzling information that it has
544 'listed companies' compared with 119 in Tokyo and 87 in New York.

It never pays to upset your stockbroker, at least not in India. G V
Ramakrishna, chairman of India's Securities and Exchange board - the
government's watchdog - has been replaced by Shirish Nadkarni, a former test
cricketer.
Ramakrishna's 'promotion' to the National Planning Commission was greeted
with jubilation by stockbrokers and caused the new year markets to soar. The
outgoing chairman, whose five-year term was cut short by more than a year,
was highly unpopular with brokers. At one stage they went on strike for a
week protesting at a ban on forward trading transactions. They claimed
Ramakrishna didn't understand the markets and was prone to excessive
nit-picking.
By contrast, Nadkarni is seen as much more 'industry-friendly'. A former
chairman of the Industrial Development Bank of India, he heads the State
Bank of India's asset management company, as well as being the sheriff of
Bombay. He's also chairman of the National Stock Exchange. How very cosy.

When is The Rank Organisation going to find a replacement for Sir Patrick
Meaney who died over 18 months ago? Sir Leslie Fletcher has been standing in
as chairman but he's well over 70 and can't be expected to hang on much
longer.
One possibility is for Michael Gifford, chief executive for over a decade,
to step up to the plate. But this wouldn't go down too well with the
institutions, especially if he wanted to combine the two jobs. The name of
Sir David Scholey, Warburg's chairman, had been mentioned. He has been
tipped to pick up the chairmanships of one or two top companies ever since
he gave up as chief executive of the merchant bank in October 1991.
But Sir Leslie is still there and Sir David is still available. Perhaps Sir
David has his eye on an even bigger prize - the chairmanship of GEC. After
all, Lord Prior has been doing it for the past decade and Lord Weinstock,
the managing director, turns 70 this year.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Is the parliamentary career of Tory MP Michael Mates, who resigned as
Northern Ireland minister in June over his links with the fugitive
businessman Asil Nadir, about to shift up a gear?
Whitehall insiders are tipping Mates as the first chairman of the new
Northern Ireland select committee, the establishment of which is imminent.
One mark against him is that MPs are sometimes reluctant for recent holders
of ministerial office to be appointed to the chair of committees the purpose
of which is to scrutinise the executive branch of government.
But Mates' independence during the Nadir kerfuffle eventually redounded to
his credit when the government admitted that privileged documents were
wrongly handed to lawyers prosecuting Nadir, thus bearing out one of Mates'
allegations. Moreover, Mates has useful experience; before becoming a
minister, he chaired the defence select committee.

It's an ill wind that blows nobody any good. As the Tory party's sexual
peccadilloes play havoc with John Major's authority, Sime International  -
the world's biggest rubber company which owns a condom brand called Jiffi -
spotted an opportunity too good to miss.
Jiffi's advertising agency, Nobull, quickly came up with a national
advertising campaign attuned to the zeitgeist: 'Next time, don't be so
conservative' it trumpeted in a full page ad for its products, which it said
were 'available not only in blue, but also red and yellow (and) ideal for
any party'.
The ad was not to everyone's taste, however. According to Nobull, The
Guardian turned it down while The Mirror said Yes, but only for an
exorbitant price. However, Today loved it, as did the Evening Standard,
which called up Nobull's media buyers to ask if it could please run it too,
at 'a hell of a lot less than rate card'.

FT  11 JAN 94 / Caustic claimant to the throne: Fear and truculence could
mark the first session of Russia's newly-elected parliament
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first speech to the lower house of the Russian parliament - the state
duma - should be given at its opening today by Mr Georgi Lukava, at 68 its
oldest member.
It is a nice newly-minted gesture to honour age: the problem arises only
with Mr Lukava's affiliation. He is a member of the Liberal Democratic Party
(LDP), the ultra-nationalists who command 64 seats in the duma, making them
the second largest group in the fragmented assembly and by far the biggest
in that half of the duma's 450 seats chosen by party affiliation.
Russia's newest and most alarming claimant to power thus has the first word.
There are those, including some of the radical democrats, who think it may
have the last word, too. As the implications of last month's elections sink
in, and as the signs from the presidency point increasingly towards a course
which at best slows the pace of economic change, the reformers grow
pessimistic and talk of going into opposition.
When President Bill Clinton flies into Moscow he will find a city in which
the main political actors find it difficult to speak their lines, because
their parts are still being written. Only Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, leader of
the LDP, seems as completely certain of himself as ever - responding to Mr
Clinton's speech in Brussels on Sunday evening with a threat to 'annihilate'
any Nato division which approached the borders of the former Soviet Union.
Though shunned by European countries, thrown out of Bulgaria, and absent
from Mr Clinton's busy schedule, Mr Zhirinovsky has effortlessly kept media
attention by his pronouncements, the now familiar mixture of bombast and
sweet reason. Among the latter, he has said he is willing to co-operate in
parliament with any of the elected groups, including the main liberal party,
Russia's Choice, though he favours the Communists and the Agrarian Party. He
seems to have come to at least a tactical agreement with them to push for
chairmanships of important committees - and may claim the foreign affairs
chairmanship for himself.
Though the arithmetic will remain unclear until the independent deputies -
who make up the majority of the 50 per cent of the duma elected in
first-past-the-post contests - decide which way to vote, it now seems likely
that it will be largely hostile to reform and strongly nationalistic in
tone. Under the constitution, the parliament has few real powers to
challenge the president and can only vote down his choice of a government by
securing a two-thirds majority. However, it is freely elected, and it seems
that President Boris Yeltsin has chosen to co-operate and compromise with it
to stop or at least delay the kind of confrontation which led to the
shelling of the White House in October.
Even before the elections, it was clear that Mr Yeltsin's team was adopting
a harsher tone in its foreign policy stance: that tone is now being further
strengthened. Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the foreign minister, now makes threatening
speeches against Ukraine for its continued retention of nuclear weapons, and
has sought to appear more patriotic than Mr Zhirinovsky when the latter
commented that Germany might share the administration of the north-west
region of Kaliningrad (formerly Konigsberg). At the same time as Mr Kozyrev
set out to reassure the west that ultra-nationalism would not influence his
foreign policy, he demanded that the west desist from 'preaching' to Russia
on how it should act.
This tone is being picked up and amplified. At a press conference yesterday
to publicise the creation of the Federal Counter-Intelligence Service
designed to replace the Security Ministry (itself replacing, or renaming,
the KGB), Mr Sergei Stepashin, the service's first deputy director,
complained that the west - and the former Soviet states, especially the
Baltics - had stepped up its intelligence activities and were seeking to
recruit senior Russian officials as spies. This may be true, but to announce
it so close to the Russia-US summit is to make a political, rather than a
factual, point.
The Russian attitude to the former Soviet states is clarifying itself - and
hardening. Membership of the Commonwealth of Independent States increasingly
means submitting to Russia's economic and security priorities. With the
exception of the Baltic states, the economic prostration of these countries,
or the large amounts of Russians within their borders, or both, dictate that
the behest of Russia is usually heeded. In the case of Belarus, the least
independent-minded of the former Soviet republics, it now appears that under
an economic treaty agreed in principle last week, the smallest Slav state
will essentially be reincorporated into Russia.
Ukraine, the second largest (after Russia) of the former Soviet Slav
countries, remains the largest potential problem, and one to which the new
parliament will pay at least as much attention as the old. Mr Clinton has
been optimistic about Ukraine's readiness finally to sign an agreement to
hand over its nuclear weapons to Russia, but such an accord has been reached
before, and they remain in Ukraine.
Within Russia itself, the chances of a reform course continuing to be
underpinned by the commitment of an all-powerful president appear to have
dwindled in the opinion of the reformers themselves.
Mr Yeltsin yesterday announced the shape of the government - slimmed down to
four deputy prime ministers and to 26 ministers. He told Mr Viktor
Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, to name his team within a week. That team,
the reformers believe, will certainly not be more strongly committed to
economic reform than the last. It may, on some scenarios, lack any of the
leading reformers altogether. Mr Chernomyrdin is constitutionally the second
most powerful figure in the country and has made it clear he sees a centrist
course as the salvation for Russia. A presidential decree yesterday named
his closest (and conservative) aide, Mr Vladimir Kvasov, as head of the
government's administrative secretariat, with ministrial rank. Mr
Chernomyrdin is no reactionary, but he has been a reluctant radical. A
weathervane politicially, he is swinging back to a middle ground which is
still to be defined but which will certainly downplay the macroeconomic
stabilisation which the radicals have struggled - so far unsuccessfully - to
achieve.
Mr Yegor Gaidar, first deputy prime minister and the symbol of Russian
reform, is likely to be named again as one of the two first deputy premiers,
according to sources in the presidential administration and among the
reformers. Doubts remain over the fate of Mr Anatoly Chubais and Mr Boris
Fyodorov, respectively deputy prime ministers for privatisation and finance.
Both, in their different ways, are less accommodating than Mr Gaidar, more
intent on demanding a commitment to deepening the reform process and to an
end to the compromises and half-measures which they believe marked the
government last year. Their agendas, differing from Mr Gaidar's, may mean a
split in the reformers' ranks.
Russia now has all the trappings of a democracy - a constitution, an elected
president, an elected assembly, a free press and an independent judiciary
whose members are still to be appointed. Its first democratic parliament
reflects its mood, fearful and truculent, scornful of its former weakness in
being so nice to other countries. This need not mean disaster. It will,
however, mean that 1994 will be another year of dangerous living.

FT  11 JAN 94 / Personal View: How the west should help Russian reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEFFREY D SACHS and CHARLES WYPLOSZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The western aid effort for Russia has been a debacle. Over the past two
years, much aid has been promised but very little has been delivered.
Technical assistance and food aid aside, almost no programmes have taken
off. Reformers have paid heavily at the polls for this failure.
As early as 1991, western governments sought to avoid budgetary
responsibility for Russia's reforms by assigning the lead aid role to the
International Monetary Fund - a cautious, narrowly focused bureaucracy
ill-suited for a task needing breadth of vision and risk-taking.
Successful reforms depend on timing and tactics. In a crisis, reformers need
to keep the initiative, and to make reforms palatable and irreversible.
These principles have been exemplified by Anatoly Chubais, Russia's
privatisation minister, whose programme has privatised 80,000 enterprises.
The same considerations should apply to monetary stabilisation. It is not
enough for the IMF to preach low budget deficits and tight money. The trick
is to help reformers implement such policies.
Foreign aid can be critical for stabilisation. Foreign resources help the
government to pay the bills (such as for social programmes) in a
non-inflationary way. Each dollar the government receives from abroad is a
dollar's worth of domestic currency that need not be borrowed from the
central bank. Foreign aid also fosters government unity, bolsters public
confidence in the reforms and signals that the government has staying power.
The best chance for stabilisation came in 1992, at the start of Russia's
reforms. Support for Yeltsin was high and reformers had the public's
confidence. Yet the west pushed hard for continued debt servicing. Moreover,
in January 1992, the IMF suggested Russia had little need of foreign
financial assistance. The IMF reversed this notion two months later, but
then did almost nothing to co-ordinate an emergency aid programme.
At no stage in 1992 did the Group of Seven industrial nations or the IMF
actually consider in detail with the Russian leadership how foreign aid
might bolster reform. There was no planning of support for social spending,
small business development or industrial restructuring. The IMF itself lent
only Dollars 1bn in 1992, under the surrealistic condition that the money be
held in reserve and not used for imports. The IMF also steered Russia away
from introducing a separate currency, early stabilisation of the exchange
rate and rapid development of a treasury bill market to help finance the
budget deficit.
The chance for a breakthrough in stabilisation was lost in 1992. The
government began to drift later in the year. Central bank leadership passed
into new and reckless hands. New conservative ministers promoted a fresh
burst of inflationary subsidies to industry and agriculture, and then
acting-prime minister Yegor Gaidar was swept from office at the end of the
year.
In 1993, the chances for a breakthrough were never as bright, but the G7's
promises of aid remained vague and the IMF refused much up-front assistance.
This guaranteed a continuation of the familiar pattern of gradual actions
backed by niggardly financial support, resulting in backsliding.
After the dissolution of the hardline parliament in September, Boris
Fyodorov, the finance minister, raised interest rates; ended subsidised
credits, grain procurement subsidies and bread price controls; and put the
central bank under the guidance of the government's credit commission, a
committee to set macroeconomic targets. Despite these breakthroughs, and
with elections weeks away, the IMF refused to disburse a planned Dollars
1.5bn loan which could have helped the government avoid politically damaging
wage payment arrears.
The reformers lost badly at the election last month. They were undone by
government inconsistencies and inaction - not by too much reform. The west
had failed to help push through basic improvements in the economy and to
help finance an adequate social safety net.
The west promised a Dollars 28bn package for 1993, of which about Dollars
5bn was actually delivered. Some Dollars 13bn was to come from the IMF, of
which Dollars 1.5bn arrived; Dollars 3bn was to come from the World Bank, of
which Dollars 600m arrived. Most of what actually came was in the form of
export credits, which were of very limited use for the reforms.
When President Bill Clinton meets President Boris Yeltsin in Moscow on
Thursday it may be too late for the reformers, who are under intense
pressure to leave office. If the reformers and the reforms survive, Clinton
must offer Yeltsin a fundamentally revised aid effort.
Given Russia's budgetary gap and urgent social needs, western governments
should provide about 4 per cent of Russian GNP (Dollars 14bn) in
quick-disbursing funds for socially oriented projects, including housing for
the military, support for targeted social relief, and funds to close coal
mines and compensate miners and their families. On the western side, the
programmes should be monitored by G7 governments, rather than the IMF.
Another Dollars 8bn - from the World Bank, European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development, and the export credit agencies - could support long-term
industrial restructuring, with investment funds and programmes for promoting
small businesses. The IMF would make available Dollars 6bn in loans, on
which there would be the normal conditions, but it would not have the
overall lead or be able to block disbursement of other funds.
The catch with our proposal, of course, is that it would require new
appropriations from western parliaments. The west must choose. Paying less
than one-tenth of 1 per cent of western GNP, or Dollars 14bn, is surely the
most important investment in Russia's democratic future and, thus, in
western security.

FT  11 JAN 94 / Leading Article: More law is not better law
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK parliament returns to work this week after the Christmas break, with
a full legislative programme to complete by the autumn. Legislation
timetabled for this session includes another education bill, the third
criminal justice act in four years and further measures to reform local
government. Yet the more that parliament revisits these important subjects,
the less satisfactory the outcome appears to be. Britain's legislative
machinery is in crisis.
One symptom of this crisis is the volume of legislation passed each year. In
1901, 40 acts were passed covering 247 pages; by 1991, the number of acts
had risen to 69, needing 2,222 rather larger pages. It is not evident that
the UK is better governed as a result.
Another symptom is the amount of time spent remedying the defects of recent
legislation. New sentencing procedures in the Criminal Justice Act 1991 were
repealed last year within months of being introduced. Quangos set up by the
1988 Education Reform Act to administer the national curriculum and testing
were abolished in the 1992 Education Act when the reforms ran into trouble.
The rules for calculating the maintenance to be paid by absent parents have
had to be changed within months of the Child Support Agency opening its
doors.
Bad law crowds out the good. Legislation on restrictive trade practices
recommended in a 1989 white paper has yet to find parliamentary time. There
is a queue of measures from the Law Commission to update the law. The
trademarks legislation which parliament will consider in this session has
been waiting since 1987.
Undue haste
Much legislation is unsatisfactory because of the haste with which it is
passed. The 1990 Dangerous Dogs Act - which has clogged the courts with
arguments over the nature of a pit bull - sped through parliament in
response to a public outcry. But ministers are also guilty of pushing
through their favoured ideas without proper consultation or analysis of the
consequences. Their haste is understandable: ministerial office often lasts
no more than a year or two. By the time the mess emerges, its creator has
moved on.
Such haste inevitably leads to bad drafting. The civil servants who draft
legislation complain that they receive instructions late, with short
deadlines and subject to changes of mind by the commissioning departments.
As a result, the government finds it necessary to present increasing numbers
of amendments to its own bills in the Lords. According to Lord Howe, the
average number of amendments has risen from 1,106 per session between 1979
and 1983 to 2,668 between 1987 and 1989.
The Broadcasting Act 1990 passed through parliament with the help of a
staggering 1,322 government amendments. It is already being torn up, with
restrictions eased on mergers of ITV companies and a new review of rules on
cross-media ownership.
Outside consultation
A recent paper from the European Policy Forum, the cross-party think-tank,
suggested the drafting of legislation should be opened up to lawyers outside
the civil service. This would break the monopoly of parliamentary counsel
and allow departments access to a wider range of talent. More important, it
could also slow down the legislative process. Outside lawyers might demand
more reasonable timetables and clearer instructions.
But much more needs to be done if the quality of UK law-making is to
improve. A high-powered commission sponsored by the Hansard Society last
year completed a two-year investigation into the legislative process. It
produced more than 100 recommendations for streamlining parliament's work,
including more consultation, deeper parliamentary scrutiny and better
timetabling. Their proposals have attracted widespread support and should be
implemented.
None of this will have the necessary impact, however, unless the political
process is also improved. Ministers too often take the view that government
office gives them the right to bulldoze through radical measures on the
basis of rudimentary analysis and inadequate testing. Incremental change -
as in the Thatcher reforms of industrial relations - may be more effective
and hence more durable than can-do government.

FT  11 JAN 94 / Leading Article: Shrinking the Fed
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The case for granting central bankers the exclusive right to run an
independent monetary policy is gathering momentum across the world. Yet in
the US, where the recent conduct of monetary policy has been notably
impressive, the movement is all in the other direction. Indeed, the Federal
Reserve is under siege. Mr Henry Gonzalez, chairman of the House banking
committee, wants to turn regional Fed presidents into political appointees
and to force more disclosure on the Fed's policy-making open market
committee. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen is anxious to relieve the Fed of
its role in banking supervision. Can it really make sense to politicise and
shrink the Fed in this way?
Fed chairman Mr Alan Greenspan clearly thinks not. And a robust defence may
yet keep the hawks on the House banking committee at bay. Trench warfare
between Congress and the Fed is normal at the point in the cycle where
politicians fear a rise in interest rates. While there may be a case for
modest changes to the way in which the open market committee discloses its
deliberations, there is no case at all for further politicising an
institution which is already subject to political pressure.
The more serious challenge comes from Mr Bentsen. For while the Treasury
Secretary's urge to put the supervisory activities of the Fed, the
Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and
the Office of Thrift Supervision under one roof may look ambitious, it is
arguably a logical response to market reality. Mr Bentsen also has a greater
head of steam behind his reform proposals than his predecessor Mr Nicholas
Brady enjoyed when he sought in vain to tidy up the same regulatory mess.
Regulatory legacy
The demarcation lines in US financial services are a hangover from the
financial crises of the 1930s. They are largely irrelevant to an age in
which banks, thrifts and industrial or commercial companies all have the
skills and technology to provide financial products to consumers and
companies across the nation. Nor is the regulatory legacy of the 1930s
appropriate to deal with the proliferation of new products that are growing
rapidly at the expense of traditional deposit taking and lending. The
financial crises of the 1980s exposed the present structure as an
anachronistic hotch-potch involving extensive overlaps and inconsistencies.
The snag with Mr Bentsen's proposal is that it opens up an old debate about
central banking, as well as precipitating a turf war and prompting worries
about a regulatory monolith. Mr Greenspan, along with many other central
bankers, argues that the Fed needs to supervise the banks because monetary
policy works better when the monetary authorities know what is going on in
the institutions that create money and advance credit. And he argues that
the Fed could not have pre-empted a credit crunch without early intelligence
from the Fed's own bank examinations.
Systemic crises
Since the 19th century central bankers have acted as lenders of last resort
in order to prevent systemic crises. Then, when bank balance sheets
contained a high proportion of marketable paper, it was not necessary for
the authorities to know much about the banks' operations. Last resort
lending was about providing a market for the banks' paper, so that solvent
banks could restore their liquidity without infecting the rest of the
system.
The growth of illiquid loans in bank balance sheets in the 20th century,
together with the increasing sophisication of the payments system, makes it
more important for central banks to understand the plumbing. The recent
temporary surge in the amount of government paper in US bank balance sheets
cannot detract from that point. It is noteworthy, too, that those countries
where supervision is conducted in a separate agency have not been immune to
disaster - witness the huge losses and consequent nationalisations that
occurred recently in the Scandinavian banking system. And combining the
thankless task of supervision with monetary policy has the advantage that
higher-quality recruits come into supervision.
The administration is right to attach priority to regulatory reform. But it
should not be necessary to part the Fed from its information sources to
bring it about.

FT  11 JAN 94 / Wars across the water: Ticket prices for a Channel crossing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The children are restless. The drive to Dover is taking its toll on tempers.
French shops and beaches beckon. But first you have to cross the Channel. Do
you take advantage of special offers from ferry operators and take your
family on 1 1/2 hour - possibly choppy - sea passage for as little as Pounds
20? Or do you use the newly-opened Channel tunnel for Pounds 240 and a
27-minute crossing?
The question will face many families this summer. Already it is plaguing the
Channel tunnel operators. If enough British families choose the faster route
to the continent after the tunnel opens on May 7, the project should soon
start to pay off the estimated Pounds 10bn construction cost. If families
choose a rival form of transport, then Eurotunnel's financial projections
will once again need to be revised.
Some idea about how competitive the tunnel will prove should emerge today
when Mr Christopher Garnett, commercial director of Eurotunnel, unveils the
fares to be charged by Le Shuttle, which will carry travellers and their
vehicles through the tunnel between Folkestone and Calais. The announcement
will mark the tunnel's transition from ambitious construction project to
operating transport system which has to attract business.
'The classic argument is that once the tunnel has been built all its
problems are behind it,' says Mr Richard Hannah, a critic of the project and
transport analyst with UBS, the securities house. 'But now we are moving
into the phase of testing the market and that is the riskiest time for the
project.'
At first sight, the market seems buoyant. Cross-Channel traffic, by air and
ferry, has increased by 48 per cent over the past 10 years. Last summer
alone, the number of passengers on the Dover-Calais ferry crossings rose by
a remarkable 25 per cent, helped by attractive price discounts and a revival
in the UK economy.
Nevertheless the Channel crossings market is fiercely competitive. The ferry
companies have had six years, since construction of the tunnel began, to
prepare for its opening: service has been improved and and many ferries are
now close to cruise liners in the amenities they offer.
Le Shuttle prices have been pitched at about the middle of the range of
ferry charges - indicating the tunnel's operators are not seeking to
undercut rivals or to claim that the tunnel will offer a premium service
justifying premium prices. Early indications suggest they will start at
Pounds 160 return for a car and five passengers in the low season, rising to
between Pounds 220 and Pounds 260 in the summer peak.
In comparison, Stena Sealink, one of the two ferry operators on the
Dover-Calais route, last week announced fares starting at Pounds 126 and
rising to Pounds 220 in the summer peak. That is lower than 1993's top rates
but represents an overall increase of about 1-2 per cent over last year.
But given the nearly Pounds 10bn invested in construction costs and the low
marginal cost of running extra trains, Eurotunnel could find itself under
pressure to discount fares. In the early years at least the Eurotunnel will
be scrambling to make up revenues lost by delays in construction and rolling
stock deliveries.
The company has been forced several times in recent years to revise down its
revenue projections, most notably for the first few years of operation. The
latest forecast - on which today's pricing figures have been based - suggest
a turnover of Pounds 224m in 1994, rising to Pounds 690m in 1996. But the
latter figure will still be little more than Eurotunnel's interest charges,
currently about Pounds 650m a year.
So the key to Eurotunnel's success will lie in its ability not merely to
steal passengers from the ferries but to generate new business and exploit
the principle that new transport projects, such as motorways, increase the
number of journeys made.
One option would be to create a market by offering cheap fares to fill the
shuttles during quiet periods. Mr Alastair Dick, an independent transport
consultant, says: 'I would expect them to create a major new off-season
market for quick trippers by offering attractive off-season fares.' There is
also potential for attracting continental car trippers into Britain: at
present it is mostly the British who take their cars across the Channel.
Low season discounts are one thing, but to succeed Eurotunnel must charge
commercially-viable rates for the bulk of its business over the long term.
In the City there is some scepticism about how easy this will prove. 'If you
want to give yourself a fright, look at the airline industry where fares
have fallen because of product innovation and the high levels of
competition,' says Mr Hannah. UBS calculates ferry and airline fares between
the UK and France will continue to fall by between 2 and 4 per cent a year
in real terms, increasing pressure on Eurotunnel.
In response, SG Warburg Securities, stockbroker to Eurotunnel, says
published cross-Channel ferry tariffs rose in real terms in the 1980s and
that the analogy with the airline industry is false because the pace of
technological change is slower in the ferry business. The Dover-Calais route
is also used as a benchmark for setting fares on other short-sea routes from
the UK, and to cut ferry prices on this route would trigger cuts on others,
hitting the profitability of ferry operators.
Warburg estimates the average cost of crossing the Channel will fall by 12
per cent in real terms between 1994 and 1997 but will then rise in line with
inflation. However, part of the reason for fares rising will be the ending
of duty free sales in 1998.
But there remains the danger of published prices being undercut. The family
taking its car on the shuttle for its annual summer holiday is just one part
of the market. Many coach operators and road haulage operators will
negotiate special deals way below the posted tariffs.
'We negotiate a single tariff for the whole year and we would expect to pay
the same rate to use the tunnel as we do for the ferries,' says Mr John
Gilbert, general manager of Eurolines UK, part of the National Express coach
group.
At the same time families from, say, the Midlands may welcome the chance to
relax and enjoy a meal on the slower ferries while truck drivers may use the
time for obligatory rest periods.
The history of Eurotunnel is littered with missed and revised forecasts.
Projecting fares and revenues remains fiendishly difficult. What is certain
is that today's announcement will be only the first shot in what could be a
bitter and protracted contest between the ferries and Le Shuttle.
Eurotunnel's shareholders and bankers will watch anxiously but
cost-conscious travellers can only benefit.

FT  11 JAN 94 / Major's deadly mantra
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Back to basics has become the defining slogan of a morally bankrupt
government. This was unintentional. The three fateful words were perhaps too
carelessly written into a speech prepared for Mr John Major last year. The
purpose was to pander to the mood of October's Conservative party
conference. The tacky little device worked. The party leader kept his job. A
difficult week passed without serious mishap.
That should have been the end of it. In a sane polity the phrase would have
been returned to the file of political cliches, to be retrieved only in
emergency. This prime minister should be so lucky. 'Back to basics' has
become a deadly mantra, meaning whatever the hearer chooses to believe. This
week it is bouncing about the media, postponing yet again, perhaps for ever,
the time when the present British government will regain the respect of its
electorate.
We may question whether Mr Major is held in such persistent contempt because
he is a weak politician, or, as an alternative, a politician in a weak
position. The latter, more charitable, explanation is supported by his
courageous policy for Northern Ireland, not to mention his steadfast
navigation by the fixed star of low inflation. He has other, less
universally celebrated, achievements to his credit, not the least of which
was the negotiation of and legislation for the Maastricht treaty. By hook
and by crook he has kept the Tories in one party, although to say that he
has united them would be a truth of the same order as his assertion in April
1992 that he would not increase taxation.
What he has not been able to do is provide intellectual coherence, a
philosophical justification for his social policies. Thinking such ponderous
thoughts through to a satisfactory conclusion is not his strength. That is
why he is imprudent to play around with the dangerous 'back to basics'. To
the Puritan right this piece of nonsense appears to mean that ministers in
Mr Major's government who are guilty of sexual misconduct must resign. There
are monastries in which the penalty is less severe.
On Sunday Mr Major tried to explain himself on BBC television's Breakfast
with Frost. He was not in favour of a witch-hunt against people who behaved
in a foolish fashion, although where people patently behaved badly then it
was perfectly proper that they shouldn't remain in a public position. These
are the weasel words of the wily whip; they do not win anyone's respect. To
be fair, the prime minister was in a corner. Even his home secretary, Mr
Michael Howard, found the Jesuitical wriggling at which he is usually so
adept difficult yesterday. 'Back to Basics' in his view certainly included
individual responsibility, but not those matters which were more the
responsibility of the pulpit than politicians . . .
It would be a joke, were it not for the victims. Mr Tim Yeo, the former
environment minister, was unjustly sacrificed. His private life was, and
remains, his own business. He was capable in office, but sadly destroyed by
a lethal phrase not of his own making. If he was now to resign his seat, he
would precipitate a by-election. The government might lose. Marvellous. The
damage to the Conservatives would have been self-inflicted, and thoroughly
deserved.
Others extend the phrase to include financial impropriety, the appearance
although not the actuality of which led to the prompt resignation of Mr Alan
Duncan, a minister's parliamentary bag-carrier. This is surely a jest.
Britain's genteel forms of corruption have become entrenched in the
constitution. The sale of honours, the payments to Conservative party funds
by companies headed by the recipients, the fattening-up of redundant
officials for transfer to the lucrative private sector, the boardroom chairs
for the ex-ministers who when in office supervised the process - all of
these wholly legal Italian practices would be swept away by a truly honest
application of 'back to basics'.
Mr Major, who apparently believes that it would be more damaging to abandon
the slogan than to persist with its use, has another interpretation. He
wants 'neighbourliness, courtliness, courtesy,' he told Sir David Frost. 'We
need those community values back.' They were taken away by the Tories. The
Conservative government has destroyed local authorities and local
communities, by centralising power in Whitehall and farming out jobs in
non-elected quangos to party supporters.
Let us give it one more try. 'Back to basics,' Mr Major said on Sunday, was
designed to meet the fears of ordinary people about unemployment, rising
crime, lower standards in education, and the instability of institutions
such as the monarchy and the church. Oh yes? The social disintegration that
the prime minister describes so well has occurred under the management of a
single party, in office for the past 15 years.
A rise in unemployment was a necessary consequence of Mr Major's
counter-inflation strategy, as his former chancellor, Mr Norman Lamont, once
famously indicated. Rising crime certainly does have everyone worried, Mr
Howard so much so that he has taken refuge in posturing as the hard home
secretary, tough on criminals. He has no credible strategy for reducing the
number of burglaries, assaults and car thefts. For that we must look to
Labour's Mr Tony Blair.
The Conservatives have an excellent strategy for education, the execution of
which they have persistently botched since it was introduced by Mr Kenneth
Baker in 1988. Mr Major's fault is that he has kept on Mr John Patten, a
singularly inept secretary for education. Mr Patten, a high priest of
moralism, managed last spring to have upset everyone - the left, the right,
the centre, the trade unions, teachers, parents - even, it is said in the
long corridors, his own permanent secretary. He may be rescued by Sir Ron
Dearing, brought in to advise him, plus a new top civil servant. But nothing
would carry education more convincingly 'back to basics' than the
appointment of a competent minister.
In short, the government has been in office too long. It cannot be blamed
for the instability of the monarchy, or the church, but only one party has
been in charge while the sense of community has been destroyed, crime has
risen, and educational standards have not. 'Back to basics' is the Tories'
last excuse.

FT  11 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Horrified by unfairness of others
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr T P W DOWLEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The unfairness of insurance companies' practices has been widely
publicised following the recent Consumers' Association 'Which?' survey. It
is said many motor insurers happy to insure a motorist's Cavalier 1.6L
refuse to insure his Escort XR3i.
Speaking as a registered insurance broker, I must remember to ask the
Consumers' Association to investigate greengrocers' shops.

FT  11 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: No case for holding up Nato expansion
(2)
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID HOWELL MP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Edward Mortimer is quite right about Nato ('How to widen the circle',
January 5). The US-inspired 'partnership for peace' is indeed a fudge - and
I believe a dangerous one. Nato should certainly expand eastwards, starting
now with a firm timetable. There is no danger of 'isolating' Russia in this
process. How one isolates a continent-sized entity like the Russian
Federation is anyway not clear. What is very clear, on the other band, is
that the underpinning of European security and the embracing of Poland and
other east/central European states in an enlarged Nato cannot possibly wait
for the ponderous and uncertain timescale of Russian reform.
To follow that path would be not just to cast away a crucial opportunity for
helping the new democracies through to stability within the Europe of which
they are unquestionably a key part (the three small Baltic states should
also be included). It would also play right into the hands of Russian
extremists, who are already delighted to see the ambiguous signals issuing
from the west.
The people in Washington (and London) who argue the other way are doing a
disservice both to Russian democratic prospects and to Europe's future
consolidation and security. I do hope that Britain, with its history of
support and understanding for the needs and hopes of the nations of east and
central Europe, large and small, will help correct the apparently rather
deep American misunderstanding of the position.

   From Mr JONATHAN SUNLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Anticipating the outcome of the Nato summit, Jurek Martin echoes the
doubts of some US defence planners opposed to full Nato membership for
central Europe on grounds of 'the security implications of sharing
operational knowledge with countries whose political futures as
western-inclined democracies could not be assured' ('Still chairman of the
board', January 8-9).
The problem with this approach is that it amounts to a self-fulfilling
prophecy. Surely the best way to ensure that the Visegrad Four states
(Poland, Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic) remain politically and
strategically committed to the west is to reciprocate the overtures of those
within these countries who have made this their goal, thereby strengthening
their domestic position? Appearing aloof or indifferent achieves the
opposite, by playing into the hands of politicians keen to use the pretext
of 'western betrayal' to popularise nationalist alternatives.
This does not mean that Nato should immediately open its doors to countries
still militarily unready for full membership. It does mean, however, that
the alliance should strive to close this gap with the most plausible
applicants in the shortest possible time, while reassuring them that they
are not being consigned to some strategic limbo.

FT  11 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: 'Horrendous' cost of proposed local
government structure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Sir IAN WRIGGLESWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, To most of us in business it is self-evident that having larger unitary
local authorities will make our lives easier, be less expensive, and, with
good management, provide better local services. It is not surprising,
therefore, that in Cleveland the Confederation of British Industry, the
Teesside Chamber of Commerce and the Teesside Small Business Club all
concluded that they would prefer two unitary authorities to replace the
existing five rather than the four favoured by the Local Government
Commission and Mr Phillip Yuill (Letters, January 4).
From the business point of view local government reorganisation shows every
sign of turning out to be a disaster. Between them the commission and the
government are going to lumber us with a new local government system that is
more expensive, less efficient and more divisive, and the bill is going to
be horrendous.
The commission estimates the transitional cost will be between Pounds 590m
and Pounds 780m. On the experience of the 1973 local government
reorganisation I shall be amazed if it is a penny less than Pounds 1bn and I
believe Sir John Banham, the commission chairman, has mentioned a similar
figure. Against the background of current public sector debt it is
staggering that the government is prepared to incur this quite unnecessary
financial burden and has specifically instructed the commission that it is
not required to put forward the lowest cost solutions.
On the question of Durham and Cleveland reorganisation I entirely refute Mr
Yuill's suggestion that we, Teesside Chamber of Commerce and the Teesside
Small Business Club, do not speak for local business. He also misinterprets
the views of the training and enterprise council and Teesside Development
Corporation.
Our membership, which has been consulted at meetings and through surveys
over many months, includes virtually every significant employer in the area
and a vast range of professional practices and smaller businesses. Not
surprisingly, they view the prospect of substantially increased costs and
four local authorities rather than two with considerable foreboding.

FT  11 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Protecting pay in low-cost countries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr S K PURSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I was glad to see Samuel Brittan ended his Economic Viewpoint (January
6) on the implications of free trade for labour markets of industrialised
countries by calling for more research on pay trends in developing and
former communist countries. Factor price equalisation in the labour market
can, in theory, be achieved by wage increases in the non-OECD world as well
as by cuts in the industrialised countries.
Indeed, it is in the global public interest for workers' wages in low-cost
exporting countries to rise as productivity increases, thus boosting
consumer demand and staving off the spectre of Marxist immiseration (growing
poverty) of the proletariat. The problem is that many employers do not
volunteer pay rises and unions cannot bargain effectively because of
repressive laws and intimidation.
Surely, the best way to avoid the destabilising tensions inherent in low pay
relative to productivity in developing and former communist countries is to
link trade liberalisation to the observance of minimum labour standards,
including the right to organise a union.

Sir, I found the article on Kaizen most interesting (Management: The Growing
Business, January 4). My colleagues and I took particular note of the
comment by Pierre Lecocq about 'lost disciplines'. My company in common with
many others went through re-organisation during the 1980s and a lot of
disciplines deemed to be overheads were removed or reduced. One of these was
the work study engineer.
This was a discipline which stood back from the day-to-day pressure and
therefore was able to see the 'wood from the trees' and advise the
management of poor layout, methods and achievement levels.
We are now in the process of introducing Kaizen into our standard
procedures: and guess where the guidelines can be found? In our 30-year-old
work study manuals.

C4's new series Undercover Britain (9.00) which promises to bring us

we are assured, alive 'and well', whatever that means, and living in London.
Sima Rey takes a job as a domestic servant to replace a girl who ran away

'Women Who Kill': five women who suffered abuse at the hands of their
partners and killed them (10.40).
BBC1 begins a series which sounds from its title as though it may be more a

FT  11 JAN 94 / Arts: Fine twists to Veronica's Room - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ira Levin has written some fine thrillers, including Rosemary's Baby, The
Stepford Wives and The Boys From Brazil. He has been mining a rich
psychological seam below the surface of ordinary life. Now the Haymarket
Theatre Basingstoke has found a little 90 minute nugget by Levin called
Veronica's Room. It is clever, knotty, scary and well worth seeing.
The plot is a gem. It is 1973. Susan and Larry are spotted in a restaurant
by an Irish couple, Maureen and John, who claim Susan is the image of their
dead employers' dead daughter, Veronica. They persuade Susan to dress up as
Veronica from the 1930s, and plunge her into a nightmare role-play by
appearing as their employers, Veronica's parents. The more Susan-Veronica
protests it is 1973, the madder she seems. There are two fine twists too
good to reveal.
Levin writes about psychoses or disorders by confining them to one place, as
he does in his novel Sliver where the action is set in one high-rise. In
Veronica's Room beneath the gloss of Nixon's America lies the normalcy of
Roosevelt's and beneath that a cesspool of incest, murder and guilt. The
play looks apt for 1990s America, too, because it is all about memories and
false memories of childhood. There is now a support group for those people
suffering from False Memory Syndrome: they thought they were abused in
childhood but turn out not to be and still suffer as if they had been, a
lose-lose situation.
The play is more made-for-TV than stage, and the actors who have to make big
gestures out of small but vital details are sometimes like the cartoon
characters flailing in mid-air and getting nowhere. There is still a rough
edge to the central performances from Frances White (Maureen), Catherine
Cusack (Susan) and Duncan Law (Larry), but they should learn from the
excellent William Franklyn (John) who plays everything pared down and
understated.
The oppressive set (Elroy Ashmore) works well in the refurbished Haymarket
to turn intimacy with the stage into claustrophobia. Adrian Reynolds'
direction is hampered by the necessary interval (theatre bars contribute
substantially to income). If the Haymarket can maintain this level of energy
and invention, it will have a good year.

FT  11 JAN 94 / Arts: Etched on the memory - Recent work by Chris Orr and
Norman Ackroyd
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To think of prints within the context of British art in the last 30 years is
to think first of the mass of screenprints, then of the offset lithographs
that were published in large editions to make contemporary art available to
a wider public. So ran the argument in the entrepreneurial 1960s, and still
it runs.
That these 'original works of art' proved not so cheap reflects not merely
the undoubted technical skills of the master printers who, for the most
part, made them for the supervising artists, nor the increasingly
sophisticated machinery at their command, but also a natural business
acumen. After all, an edition of 500 at only Pounds 500 a throw comes to -
well, quite a lot, even after overheads. There are not so very many artists
even today who can command as much for a single painting.
Good luck to them. I make the point only to make the further point that such
essentially commercial an enterprise was superimposed upon the much older
practice of the artist-printmaker, who works directly upon the block or
plate or stone, draws or engraves or etches it, and proofs the thing
himself. Such is the true 'original print', small in the edition, direct in
the expression, the product of labour as intensive and personal as the
creative process itself.
In this we have a strong and continuing tradition that goes back through
early Hockney, early Freud and early Sutherland to Brockhurst, Strang,
Menpes, Sickert, Hayden, Whistler, Keane and Cruikshank and beyond. Two of
the best and most idiosyncratic of our current etchers, both of them well
into their mature careers, are now showing together for a short time at the
Bankside Gallery.
With Chris Orr we find ourselves indeed looking further back to the gleeful
graphic scurrilities of the 18th century and the Regency, though rather to
the ribaldry of Rowlandson and Hogarth's more general social satires than to
Gillray's wickedly particular political attack. Orr is in fact hardly a
satirist at all, so genial and affectionate is his view of man's foibles and
preoccupations, whether carnal or spiritual. His suite on the life of
William Blake is quite as touching as it is hilarious, taking up incidents
and quotations of his wonderful visionary innocence - the tree full of
angels on Peckham Rye, for example; the Tyger leaping on his bed; his belief
that the world was flat; and this exchange with his wife: 'Good God, here's
Edward III.' 'Where?' 'On the other side of the table, you can't see him,
but I do, it's his first visit.'
But Orr's most engaging image is the large 'Small Titanic', a cut-away side
view of the ship full steam ahead, deck by deck, cabin by cabin, gloriously
incidental, improbable and inconsequential. There, puffing contentedly at
his pipe, is the captain at the wheel and there, far below, the mermaid
consoling the crew. And in between? Everything you can imagine: a salesman
in ladies' underwear knocking at a cabin door, chickens running round the
galley floor, the washing hanging out on deck, the whole world kissing,
flirting, flapping, ogling the day away. Wonderful.
Orr's drawing as such is deceptively awkward, knowingly innocent, retaining
the directness and vivacity of the talented schoolboy artist, just as in the
imagery he retains so much of the vivid, jokey, smutty inventiveness of the
schoolboy - as though he were Just William off to art school. Any such
impression, true as it is to the spirit of the work, belies its technical
quality. For these prints are beautifully made, so beautifully that we
hardly notice, as we are drawn, engrossed, into the action.
Norman Ackroyd is another consummate technical etcher, albeit of rather
different and infinitely adventurous a kind. Where Orr uses line, drawn and
etched in the usual way, Ackroyd has taken the use of aquatint - in itself a
standard technique - to the limits of its expressive potential. Aquatint was
always available as a means of establishing broad areas of tone, varied by
the time spent in the acid, in relation to whatever the drawn image might
be. What Ackroyd does is simply to use it with the freedom of watercolour,
and the plate itself as though it were but a page in the sketch-book. He
even dispenses with the aquatint altogether, drawing in acid on the plate
directly with the brush, as though it were but water from the pot.
The effects he achieves place him in direct line with that romantic
landscape tradition that is one of the glories of British art. And his
practice, too, of setting off to remote and romantic places and using his
art to keep topographical account of his journeyings, places him honourably
in the steps of his heroes, such as Turner and Crome. The economy of the
statement is remarkable, a horizontal line to set the space, a tonal sweep
for cloud or mist or hillside, a flicker of interest for undergrowth, an
evocative shadow for the ghost of a tree or a rock or a gable end. Sometimes
there will be a focus of detail more closely worked and resolved, but not
always. And yet there these places are as we know them, if only by power of
imagination, from the Stacs of St Kilda to the ramparts of Cadbury Castle -
'Yet still the blood is strong, the heart is Highland,/ And we in dreams
behold the Hebrides.'
He is using the opportunity at Bankside to make a short review of the work
that has come of his more recent expeditions: the Western Shore (Ireland
1987); The Pictish Coast (Scotland 1988); Saint Kilda (1989); the Windrush
(1990); the Summer Isles (Hebrides 1991); and North South East West (all
over the place), all published by the Penny Press and sold as folios or
single prints unless already sold out.

FT  11 JAN 94 / Arts: Players of promise in the PLG - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Every January the Park Lane Group sets about shaking off the sleepiness that
grips London music over the new year period. Since 1956 the game plan for
doing so has remained pretty well fixed: a five-evening series of chamber
concerts in the Purcell Room, two each evening, in which young artists
tackle choice varieties and careful combinations of 20th-century music.
The 38th series (January 9-13) is under way. In advance one may have
wondered - as one has tended to in recent years - whether the PLG formula
had become tamely predictable, had even outlived its usefulness. But then
Sunday's opening presentations brought on three young players of promise,
each of whom one was glad to encounter for the first time, each of whom
programmed a wide selection of (mainly) post-war music. The suspicion was
once again proved unworthy and unjust, in the most satisfying of ways.
The most remarkable of the three youngsters, Jonathan Kelly, was last year
appointed principal oboe of the City of Birmingham Symphony. No wonder: he
is a simply smashing player, an on-the-toes virtuoso whose delivery boasts a
leaner timbre, a sharper definition to the line than is common with British
woodwind players (no doubt the training under Maurice Bourgue in Paris had
something to do with it).
He made light, in both senses, of the musical and interpretative demands of
two modern oboe-and-piano showpieces, Richard Rodney Bennett's After Syrinx
I and Paul Patterson's Duologue (the trim rhythms of his pianist, Alison
Procter, provided strong ballast). A new piece by Jonathan Dove, first of
this year's PLG commissions, extended the range into long-breathed lyricism
 -a short Irish-folksong fantasy, it is titled Music for a Lovelorn
Lenanshee and combines craftsmanlike skill and salon-music charm. Thea
Musgrave's Niobe for oboe and tape, its patterns no less elegantly threaded,
completed the impression of fine-focused musicianship.
For this player a bright future is easily predicted. For the two pianists -
the Russian Olga Balakleets, who occupied the early-evening session, and
Lisa Loh from Hong Kong, who rounded out the later one alongside Mr Kelly -
the crystal ball is slightly cloudier.
Still, both gave considerable pleasure. The first, assertive but never
overbearing, keen in directing every musical current, made a particular
success of Martin Butler's On the Rocks (1992), a fluent, somewhat
wry-flavoured, always appealing tribute to Debussy's La Mer. The second, who
stepped in to the series at a late stage in place of an ailing
mezzo-soprano, revealed an unflappably cultivated touch and a sinuous sense
of phrase in Dutilleux, Messiaen and the Canadian composer Francois Morel.

FT  11 JAN 94 / Arts: Monteverdi a la grecque - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Though the English Bach Festival may be in deep financial trouble, its
founder-director Lina Lalandi is determined that it will go down, if it
must, with all flags proudly flying. The EBF's Monteverdi at Covent Garden
on Sunday - his noble L'Orfeo, realised with scrupulous 'period' attention
to the composer's musical plan (but no castrati) - may even have had its
last performance as well as its first, should its provisional Spanish tour
misfire. EBF productions are prepared to a very high standard, very
expensively; here, the price of seats in the Royal Opera stalls left too
many of them unfilled.
Spanish readers should insist upon hearing this Orfeo with all the Latin
urgency at their command; it is far too good to be left dangling. It is not
exactly a 'revelation', as some earlier baroque excursions by the EBF have
been; for after centuries of neglect this 1607 opera has lately been taken
up far and wide - in widely different versions and adaptations, some aiming
no less keenly at 'authenticity'. But Sunday's performance was satisfying,
beautiful, and beautifully consistent in its own particular terms.
Those terms were special, though never eccentric. On the one hand, the music
was entrusted to period-specialist singers (17 of them, many doubling as
solo personae and as choristers) and period-instrument players of a high
calibre. The roll-call of the latter matched Monteverdi's specified crew
closely; divided between the front corners of the stage - each team boasting
its own imposing viola da gamba - their virtuosity and their vividly various
timbres conquered the flat Royal Opera acoustic brilliantly. We have heard
leaner 'authentic' treatments of the music, but the richer, boldly dramatic
contrasts here sounded plausible as could be.
On the other hand, the customary EBF concern with visual period-details was
suspended in favour of Getting Back to the Greek (Miss Lalandi is Greek.)
Instead of replicating the costumes, stage-gestures and dances of
Monteverdi's Renaissance time, Tom Hawkes's production was dressed in
faithful Ancient Greek clothes - with more sophisticated dyes, perhaps - and
antique-style crowns and bracelets by the jeweller Ilias Lalaounis, enacted
with restrained, stylised gestures, and in homely choreography by Sarah
Cremer. To have shepherds skipping in circles, short chitons and big rustic
smiles was a bit of a risk, but nobody actually laughed.
The considered depths of the opera were made too palpable for frivolous
reactions. Against Howard Williams' vital account of the score, the solo
singers and the well-tuned chorus stood out superbly, searching out the
expressive force of Monteverdi's lines. The one weakness was their foggy
Italian (Monteverdi cared enormously about the words): in the Prologue Naomi
Harvey's prettily-sung 'La Musica' was particularly muzzy. Marilyn Hill
Smith was a poised Eurydice with a matronly grace, Della Jones a fine,
quietly intense Messenger.
In the title-part the baritone Russell Smythe was properly heroic, alight
with passionate feeling, and with all the necessary resources - Monteverdi's
Orpheus is a cruelly taxing sing - to carry him through the great plaints of
Acts 3 and 5. Among the lesser players the bass Graeme Broadbent gave
splendid weight to Pluto, lord of the underworld, but to praise his
colleagues fairly would require listing all of them. Peter Rice's basic
design, an elegant three-doored temple frontage, sometimes became
transparent to afford visions further back, notably a tableau of Charon
ferrying the dead across the Styx. It all hung together, without fuss; we
felt we were hearing Monteverdi plain, and very rewarding it was.

FT  11 JAN 94 / People: Morton moves, but stays put
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Clive Morton, currently director of personnel for Northern Electric, has
been appointed personnel director for the Rolls-Royce Industrial Power
Group, replacing Petter Tweddle, who is retiring.
Morton will also become a member of the Rolls-Royce Industrial Power Group
board - a key factor in his decision to accept the job although he has been
with Northern Electric, where he was not a board member, for less than two
years.
His new post, for which he was headhunted, is based at Industrial Power
Group's headquarters in Newcastle. This was also an important consideration
for the 50-year-old Londoner, who has become one of the best known figures
in north-east England's business community since moving to the region in
1986 as director of personnel and administration for Komatsu UK.
While with Komatsu, the Japanese-owned earth moving equipment manufacturer,
Morton set up the company's plant at Birtley, Tyne and Wear, and also
established a reputation as a vociferous champion of Japanese-style
management methods.
At Northern Electric, he has introduced cultural changes including a move
towards a team-working, rather than a sequential, structure, and also
negotiated a single agreement with the four trade unions representing
employees, in order to increase flexibility and efficiency.
He says it is too soon to say what changes he might make at Industrial Power
Group, although he will be looking to see whether he could help introduce
more world class processes.
The decision to leave Northern Electric was very difficult to make, he says,
but his new post is a great opportunity to join a major manufacturer and
exporter as a board member. He will take up his new position in the next few
months.

FT  11 JAN 94 / Business and the Law: Gender latitude on pension schemes -
European Court
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Court of Justice has ruled that it is not unlawful under
European Union law for an employer to make differing contributions to a
contributory pension scheme for male and female employees.
The case concerned a Mr David Neath, who was made redundant at the age of 54
in 1990 after 17 years service with his employer, Hugh Steeper, a
Leeds-based artificial limb manufacturer. During his employment, he had
contributed to private occupational pension schemes. Although the employees'
contributions to the schemes corresponded to a percentage of their salary
which was the same irrespective of their sex, the employer's contributions
differed for men and women because of the actuarial factors used.
The scheme in question allowed men to claim a full pension at 65 and women
at 60. On his redundancy, Mr Neath was entitled to have his acquired pension
rights transferred to another pension scheme or to receive a deferred
pension payable at 65. He could also convert part of the deferred pension
into a capital sum.
Mr Neath realised that his financial position would be better if the
interpretation of the Court's judgment in the Barber case were that his
pension could be recalculated on the same basis as his female counterparts
for the entire period of his 17 years' service, rather than just for the six
weeks subsequent to May 17 1990, the date of the Barber judgment.
He also realised that, whatever the effects in time of the Barber judgment,
the value of his pension in whatever form he took it would be lower than a
female employee would have received because of the use of the actuarial
factors based on the differing life expectancy of men and women.
He brought an action before the Leeds Industrial Tribunal seeking the same
pension rights as his female counterparts. The tribunal referred two issues
to the European Court: the effect in time of the Barber judgment and the use
of actuarial factors differing according to sex.
The first issue was resolved in the Court's judgment of October 6 1993 in
the Ten Oever case, where the Court held that the principle of equal pay
should apply only to benefits payable in respect of periods of employment
after May 17 1990, except in the case of claims initiated before that date.
The Court in the present case reiterated this and added that the principle
should also apply to transfer benefits and lump-sum options.
On the second issue, the Court had to decide whether the fact that male
employees would be entitled to less than their female counterparts because
of the use of actuarial factors was compatible with EC equal pay rules.
To decide this, the Court had to determine whether the transfer benefits and
lump-sum options available to Mr Neath amounted to pay. The European
Commission argued they should be treated as pay and that, thus, no
differences in treatment based on sex could exist unless objectively
justified. Statistical data based on the life expectancy of men and women
were not objectively justified as they reflected averages, whereas the right
to equal treatment was given to individual employees.
The Court rejected this argument. It said the concept of pay encompassed the
commitment given by an employer to pay an employee defined benefits or
specific advantages. Anything outside that commitment did not constitute
pay.
In the context of an occupational pension scheme, the employer's commitment
was the payment of a periodic pension at a particular moment in time.
However, the commitment did not include the funding arrangements by which
the periodic payment would be secured. Thus, an employer's contributions to
a pension scheme which were unequal due to the use of different actuarial
factors for men and women were not incompatible with EC equal pay rules.
The Court ruled that this principle covered transfer benefits and lump-sum
options, the value of which could be determined only by reference to the
particular funding arrangements in question.

FT  11 JAN 94 / Business and the Law: Dissatisfied clients at Europe's Bars
 -A barrier-free market is a long way off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One year after the unveiling of the European Single Market, lawyers are
still some way from establishing a free market in legal services.
Progress has been made towards lowering the barriers which prevent lawyers
practising in foreign jurisdictions. In Europe, the European Commission is
considering a draft establishment directive giving lawyers the right to set
up shop in foreign jurisdictions, while globally, there have been efforts to
open up legal services under the auspices of the General Agreement on Trade
and Tariffs. However, agreement at both levels has proved elusive.
Mr John Toulmin QC, the outgoing president of the Council of the Bars and
Law Societies of Europe (CCBE), an umbrella organisation for the European
legal profession, says agreement is now urgent. There has been a large rise
in demand for cross-border legal services in the past five years, he says,
largely the result of the globalisation of business.
If lawyers are going to meet the new and increased demands from clients they
must move towards a unified position on legal practice and regulation, he
adds. Mr Toulmin remains optimistic about achieving a single market for
legal services in Europe, in spite of the lack of progress since the CCBE
submitted its draft establishment directive to the Commission in 1992.
Despite opposition from some EC member states, the Commission is pressing
ahead with the draft directive. At a meeting with Commission officials in
December, the CCBE was assured that the Commission's final draft would be
published within three months.
The need for uniform rules governing lawyers' rights to practise in the EU
is accepted by the Commission, he says, and by most of the European Bars.
There are a number of issues which remain unsettled, such as the question of
whether after three years' practice in a foreign jurisdiction a foreign
lawyer should be able to, or should be required to, become a full member of
the Bar of the host member state. Mr Toulmin says agreement on the directive
can be reached by the end of the year.
A Gatt deal on legal services, in contrast, may prove harder to achieve.
Representatives of the CCBE, Gatt and the American and Japanese Bars met in
France last October to try and settle the outstanding obstacles to a global
legal services deal.
One of the main issues is the US and Japanese refusal to allow foreign
lawyers to practise in the US or Japan until they have practised in their
own country for five of the previous seven years.
This stipulation makes it more expensive for foreign firms to open up
offices in Japan or the US because they would have to staff them with
experienced - and expensive - lawyers.
At the meeting in France, there were signs that both the Americans and the
Japanese may be prepared to relax the five-year rule. The US is considering
reducing or abolishing the rule. In Japan there has already been a softening
of the stipulation with the Japanese now saying two years' practice outside
a foreign lawyer's own jurisdiction would also be sufficient.
The Japanese also agreed to look again at domestic rules which prevent
foreign lawyers in Japan advising local firms on the law of a foreign
jurisdiction - a restriction Mr Toulmin describes as 'absurd'.
The main sticking point to a Gatt legal services agreement is the nature of
the work that foreign lawyers should be able to practise in overseas
jurisdictions.
The Americans do not necessarily want individual US lawyers to be able to
practise the local law of a foreign jurisdiction, but they do want to be
able to offer a local service by hiring local lawyers and, potentially,
appointing local partners anywhere in the world. The head of the US
delegation at the meeting in France, Mr Steve Nelson, a partner of Dorsey &amp;
Whitney, said the aim was to be able to form 'international multinational
partnerships'.
European and Japanese Bars oppose this. The CCBE position is that foreign
lawyers should be able to advise on their own national law and on
international law but not on the law of the host state. EC law, however,
would be treated as part of the national law of each member state, which
would mean US firms in Europe would not be able to advise on EC legislation.
The main disadvantage of a global legal services deal would be that it could
undermine bilateral or multilateral deals outside the Gatt. For example,
such a deal might threaten bilateral pacts between the US and the UK under
which American and English lawyers can form multinational partnerships.
Mr Toulmin points to a formula which could allow progress on a global legal
services deal. Foreign lawyers could advise on their own law and on
international law and take part in all arbitrations except domestic ones.
They would have to register with the local competent authority and submit to
local conduct and disciplinary rules provided those rules conform with
accepted standards. This would be the minimum requirement entitling a state
to most-favoured nation treatment for legal services - that is, exemption
from the requirement under the Gatt general services agreement to give equal
market access to all trading partners.
Mr Toulmin accepts that not all European member states would find such an
approach acceptable. But he warns that unless someone produces a positive
formula for an agreement soon, a deal on global legal services could prove
impossible. That, he adds, would be a serious setback for both lawyers and
their clients.

FT  11 JAN 94 / Business and the Law: Competitive improvement - Legal briefs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Significant improvements in the European Commission's handling of
competition cases have been called for by the House of Lords Select
Committee on the European Communities.
The Committee, chaired by Lord Slynn, the Law Lord and former British judge
at the European Court of Justice, is opposed to fundamental structural
change such as hiving-off competition investigations to a separate
authority, but it calls for changes in Commission procedures.
The Lords recommend improved access for businesses to the Commission's file
on a complaint or investigation, with powers for the independent official
known as the hearing officer to rule on conflicts between access and
confidentiality.
Where national inspectors carry out 'dawn raids' on business premises for
the Commission they should work under identical guidelines to Commission
inspectors.
When the Commission closes an investigation with a 'comfort letter'
indicating, without a formal decision, it does not intend to take further
action, it should explain its findings more clearly.
There should be more block exemptions from the competition rules covering
wide categories of cases to reduce the need for individual companies to
apply for an exemption.
Reasons for imposing a fine should be set out fully.
The Competition Directorate (DGIV) and the Court of First Instance in
Luxembourg (CFI) (which handles competition cases) should have better
resources.
Procedural changes recommended by the Committee include:
mandatory timetables to be laid down at the outset of an investigation for a
formal decision;
appeals against a ruling of a hearing officer to a single judge of the CFI;
leave of a national judge required before a Commission decision ordering an
investigation is carried out against the wishes of the company concerned;
a simplified new procedure leading to a decision by a single Commissioner;
investigation and assessment of appropriate cases delegated to national
competition authorities;
and harmonisation of national remedies, notably on damages, injunctions and
interim measures.

FT  11 JAN 94 / Business and the Law: Contradictory finding on law firm
defections - Legal briefs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The increasingly competitive nature of the legal services industry in the US
was underlined by a recent California Supreme Court decision allowing law
firms to include clauses in partnership agreements designed to prevent
partners defecting and setting up in competition.
The decision has caused a stir in US commercial legal circles because it
contradicts a 1989 ruling by the New York Court of Appeals that such clauses
amount to an unlawful restraint of trade.
The New York court ruled that any clause in a partnership agreement
providing for the witholding of profit share if a partner defects would
amount to an unfair restraint on a lawyer's freedom to practise where he
chose and could also interfere with clients' rights to instruct the lawyer
of their choice.
But the California Supreme Court, in its December decision, said that law
firms should not be treated differently from other business partnerships
which are allowed to enter into such anti-competitive agreements under
Californian law.
'A revolution in the practice of law has occurred requiring the economic
interests of the law firm to be protected as they are in other business
enterprises,' the court said.
The case arose after the defection in 1987 of several partners from the Los
Angeles firm of Parker Stanbury Babcock Combs and Bergsten to set up the
rival firm of Howard Moss Loveder Strickroth &amp; Walker in nearby Santa Ana.
The partners claimed they had been denied their share of the profits for
unbilled work and work in progress when they left.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Tony Frendo, managing director, finance and administration, and a main board
director at ARGYLL, the food retailing group, is resigning at the end of the
month to pursue other business interests.
Frendo, 46, says that after 20 years with two companies - 10 with Sir James
Goldsmith's Cavenham group, and 10 with Argyll - and after more than eight
years in the same job, he is looking for a new challenge.
At Argyll, such a challenge might have been presented by the chief
executive's job, but that role recently went to Colin Smith, previously
finance director. 'I have got to the point where I would like more variety,'
says Frendo. 'I would like to move away from a mainstream job with one
company, to taking up a series of directorships, working with different
people.'
He says an example of that might be representing a venture capital business
on the board of another company. He believes he has a number of skills to
offer, especially in integrating new acquisitions. At Argyll, he was deeply
involved in integrating Safeway, acquired in 1987.
As for as his immediate plans, Frendo says he is 'pursuing a number of
things, but they are at an early stage'.

Baroness Dean (above left), of Thornton-le-Fylde, formerly Brenda Dean who
was general secretary of the trade union Sogat, has gained her first
non-executive directorship. She is joining the board of INVERESK, the
Fife-based specialist paper group, which floated on the stock exchange last
year.
The company has also appointed Bill Goodall (above right) as non-executive
chairman, replacing Ingram Lenton who is resigning his directorships because
of ill-health.
Dean, who became a Labour life peer last year after stepping down as deputy
general secretary of the GPMU, into which Sogat - the principal union for
paper workers - merged, won the respect of the paper industry for her
constructive attitude to change. The industry last year awarded her its gold
medal.
Lenton, a former managing director of the papermakers Bowater, chaired
Inveresk after its management bought it out of Georgia Pacific in 1990 and
steered it through last year's flotation. Goodall, who retired as executive
chairman of the mini-conglomerate Scapa Group in October, was intended to be
Lenton's successor but has had his appointment to the chair speeded up.
Inveresk now complies with the Cadbury Report strictures, having a
non-executive chairman and, now with Dean, two non-executive directors. Ian
Boyd, finance director of Weir Group, joined the board last year.

FT  11 JAN 94 / Technology: Cellular working reassessed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cellular manufacturing was one of the most important tools used by
manufacturers in the 1980s to improve their competitiveness, but users are
now re-evaluating its benefits, according to a report by Ingersoll
Engineers.
It is not that employers have gone off the idea of cells - mini-business
units that operate semi-
autonomously, handling manufacturing or assembly - says the UK-based
management consultancy.
Indeed, a phenomenon that Ingersoll dubbed 'the quiet revolution' has gained
momentum, with penetration up by 40 per cent in three years. Six out of 10
UK engineering companies have switched to cell manufacturing since 1985 and,
according to one, 'if we hadn't gone to cells, we wouldn't be in business'.
What is shifting, according to Ingersoll's report, is the rationale for
introducing cells.
Three years ago, it says, the principal objectives were defined in terms of
'hard' factors such as better on-time delivery, improved response and
reduced stocks. 'Soft' or people-oriented factors such as commitment,
training and clearly defined responsibilities were seen as important
'inputs' for the success of the cells.
However, three years later soft factors are being perceived as 'outputs' or
benefits.
The result is a much more balanced view of the benefits of hard and soft
issues. Team working and empowerment are seen as equally important as
quicker throughput and reduced work-in-progress.
The survey found that some 73 per cent of companies use cells, compared with
51 per cent in the previous study, and that a further 7 per cent plan to do
so. Significantly, only one company in the sample of 51 had used, and then
abandoned, cell techniques.
According to Brian Small, Ingersoll's managing director, cells are creating
'a much greater commercial awareness at every level - with significant
paybacks for organisations as a whole and with everyone getting closer to
the customer'.

FT  11 JAN 94 / Technology: Miners bitten by the gold bug - How Ashanti is
using bacteria to release the precious metal at its processing plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEN GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Gold miners like to think that their latest allies, Thiobacillus
ferro-oxidans, spend their lives eating and breeding.
They speak affectionately of them as 'gold bugs', which munch their way
through ore to release precious metal that would otherwise be very difficult
to liberate. If bugs are treated well, their number multiplies rapidly.
That is certainly the way that many of those responsible for the world's
biggest biological gold processing venture talk about T. ferro-oxidans.
Their venture, a Dollars 105m (Pounds 71m) plant at Ashanti Goldfields in
Ghana, starts up well ahead of schedule this week, instead of March as
originally planned. The plant is a crucial element in a Dollars 305m,
three-year expansion scheme that will take Ashanti's annual gold output
above 1m troy ounces and place it among the world's top 10 producers.
When pressed, however, the miners have to admit that the truth about T.
ferro-oxidans is more complex but no less colourful. These bacteria are
among the most odd of this planet's life forms. They require a very acid
environment and a temperature of between 30`C and 40`C to do their best
work. They are unaffected by high concentrations of most metals.
But they do not 'munch' gold ore. They cause enzyme and chemical changes on
the gold-bearing sulphide rock, extracting electrons or energy from the ore
and breaking the sulphide bonds. That releases the metal. Neither do they
breed in the conventional way. Every few hours each single-cell bacterium
splits in two - and that leads to the rapid multiplication.
T. ferro-oxidans cannot cause disease because it can only develop on
inorganic matter. Those bacteria being employed by Ashanti started life in
South Africa at the Fairview gold mine. It was at Fairview that Gencor, the
South African mining group, built the first commercial-scale gold processing
plant to use biological leaching. Ashanti is relying on technology developed
by Gencor; technology that is also being used at the Sao Bento gold mine in
Brazil and at the Harbour Lights and Wiluna mines in Western Australia.
Until the mid-1980s, miners used two other methods to break down (or
oxidise) refractory (or difficult) ore that otherwise would have released
very little of its gold: pressure oxidation and roasting. Both are
expensive, and roasting has the added drawback of sending liberated sulphur
and arsenic compounds up the chimney. If the compunds are not captured they
produce acid rain and poison the countryside.
Neither of these high-tech processes seem in any great danger from
bioleaching, however. Two large gold projects where bioleaching would work
well - at Lihir Island in Papua New Guinea and Kanowna Belle in Western
Australia - have decided to used pressure oxidation and roasting
respectively.
Ashanti considered roasting its refractory ore but opted for bioleaching
because operating costs should be lower and it 'is the world's most
environmentally friendly way of extracting gold from ore', says John Clarke,
Ashanti's consulting metallurgist. Roasting also needs high-tech process
plant - temperatures of 680`C-700`C are required - and is not really
suitable in a country where there are shortages of the skills needed to
operate and provide technical support for such equipment.
In contrast, the bioleaching process is relatively simple to operate.
'Constancy is the key to successful bioleaching,' says Clarke. 'Constant
material, constant temperature. Always let the bugs acclimatise to their new
environment.'
Ashanti's plant was built by Minproc, the Australian group. Sulphide ore is
crushed into a powder, which is mixed with water in tanks into which the
bacteria are introduced. After the bugs have done their work - they take
about four days and release more than 90 per cent of the gold - the solution
is moved to conventional carbon-in-leach tanks where gold is recovered. The
solution containing the free arsenic, sulphur and iron is pumped into
neutralisation tanks. Limestone and lime - 150,000-200,000 tonnes a day,
accounting for half the operating costs - is added to the solution, which is
rendered non-toxic as it hardens to form stable arsenic and sulphur
compounds.
Ashanti's plant has six times the capacity of the biggest built so far, but
each tank is only twice the size of those at Sao Bento and Wiluna. Clarke
suggests it is unlikely that bigger tanks will be used elsewhere because of
the need to keep supplying T. ferro-oxidans with oxygen and nutrients.
Initially, the bugs will be responsible for producing about half Ashanti's
gold and, in a year or so, nearly all of it.
The question being asked elsewhere in the gold mining industry is: do the
bugs have to be kept in tanks to do their work?
Newmont Mining, biggest of the US gold miners, believes tanks are not
necessary. Newmont has built a 20,000-tonne heap of refractory ore at its
operations on the Carlin Trend in the Nevada desert and introduced T.
ferro-oxidans to it. The company has already established that the system
works technically and has patented some aspects (such as the way the fluid
containing the bugs can be percolated through a large heap of ore and not
allowed to get too hot or too cold). Newmont is about to begin a feasibility
study to look at capital and operating costs to make sure that its process
is commercially viable.
Once the bacteria have done their work, the heap must be washed and
neutralised and then the gold extracted by conventional heap-leaching, by
which a weak cyanide solution is trickled through the ore to capture the
metal.
Newmont is also experimenting with a chemical other than cyanide, though it
will not say which.

FT  11 JAN 94 / Technology: To boldly go into PC future - Computers that can
be controlled by speech are rapidly becoming reality
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEOF WHEELWRIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Star Trek has a lot to answer for. The popular science fiction television
and film series, first shown in 1966, set high expectations for computers
that could be controlled by talking to them - and having them talk back.
Although it has taken a quarter of a century, science fiction is now rapidly
becoming reality. Within two years, most personal computers will come with
speakers, a microphone, built-in sound processing, CD-Rom players and
operating system-level sound software.
Until recently, however, there have been few business applications available
to take advantage of these sonic PC appendages. Two promising areas that are
emerging are 'command and control' and voice annotation. Both offer improved
efficiency over keyboards and computer mice and could help to make PCs much
easier to use.
Voice 'command and control' enables PC users to speak commands to the
computer rather than typing them. The advantages are clear, but the drawback
of this technology is that it requires the user to spend a long time
training the PC sound system to recognise his or her voice.
Even when the system has been trained, it can often be disrupted by
background noise. If someone is using the photocopier, the fax machine is
beeping or the air-conditioning has just been switched on, the PC may get
confused.
This problem can be minimised by wearing a telephone operator-style headset
that includes headphones to listen to the sound system and a wrap- around
unidirectional microphone that sits only inches from your lips.
Recognition under these circumstances is actually quite good. You will,
however, have to get used to the idea of being tethered to your PC. Get up
quickly and you find your headset, microphone - and anything else you may be
wearing from the neck up - being dragged off your face, not to mention the
complications of confusing a telephone headset and the one being used for
voice recognition.
The second big area where voice is expected to make inroads is that of
document voice annotation. This is where users can add voice 'notes' to
computer documents.
The idea is that voice annotation of documents provides a quick and easy way
of making comments about the content of the documents - without the comments
having to become part of the textual or graphic content of the document.
Thus changes can be requested to a document without users having to type out
those changes.
Voice annotation is expected to be particularly useful in situations where a
number of people might be collaborating on preparation of a single document.
By using voice annotation as the document is passed around the workgroup
over an electronic mail system, the project co-ordinator can make all the
changes at once without having to worry about using specialised 'versioning'
software to keep track of them.
Voice annotation could also be useful in making confidential comments about
financial figures in spreadsheets or making comments on marketing
presentations before they are completed. Any situation where, in the past,
you might have dictated a note to be typed up and attached to a document is
a candidate for voice annotation.
If speech-embedding technology continues to use better compression (so that
messages do not take up as much disc space or hog the network) and voice
command systems can further improve on their accuracy of recognition, while
cutting down on the 'training' time of the system, then PC users may soon
have the power of a starship commander.

FT  11 JAN 94 / Management (The Growing Business): A soft route to high-tech
 -Too few bright ideas are converted into successful UK businesses. Richard
Gourlay describes how one consultancy has made the transition to
manufacturer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the German group Bosch was looking for a way to differentiate its
cordless hand power tools in a market flooded with similar products it chose
to introduce a battery charge-monitor. But it lacked the technology to
measure the residual power of Nickel-cadmium batteries.
Esselte, the Swedish office products group that owns the internationally
renowned Dymo labelling system, had a similar challenge. Despite owning an
excellent brand, Esselte Dymo saw increasing competition from newer
technologies, notably Brother of Japan, but had a limited research and
development capability to update its products.
Both companies arrived at solutions with the help of The Technology
Partnership, a Hertfordshire-based company that started life seven years ago
as a engineering and scientific consultancy.
Bosch's battery monitor and Esselte Dymo's electronic labeller are now
successfully on the market. But for The Technology Partnership, product
development contracts like those with Bosch and Esselte Dymo provided a
knowledge base that has helped it follow an unusual path of growth.
After seven years the group is manufacturing and developing high-tech
products in its own right, supported by the knowledge and the cash generated
from developing products for third parties.
There is nothing new in consultants working beside a company's in-house
development team to come up with new products or innovations; the cost of a
full blown R&amp;D department can be exorbitant for many groups and many
companies also value the independent views of outsiders.
But the step from consulting to manufacturing is still relatively unusual.
By the standards of recent UK high-tech start-ups, The Technology
Partnership has enjoyed a considerable success - it now employs 170 people,
six-times more than when it started, and has sales of over Pounds 13m.
With some justification The Technology Partnership claims to be joining an
all-too-select club of successful high-tech start-up companies in the UK, a
list that includes Apricot, Acorn, Domino Printing and Oxford Instruments
but precious few others.
According to David Connell, head of The Technology Partnership's strategy
division, theirs is a model of development that the government should be
supporting if it wants to encourage a more dynamic base of high technology
start-ups.
'The traditional venture capital model is one where you have your product
and your business plan, and you raise finance, do the development and market
the product,' says Connell. This approach - what has become known as a 'hard
company' start-up - often requires a full management team, considerable
capital and substantial risk. Given the risks, it is not surprising that
there have been so few successes.
By contrast the 'soft start-up company' sells consultancy or does contract
manufacturing for a customer, using the cashflow and experience it acquires
to 'harden up' and develop its own products.
The problem is that even the handful of venture capital funds prepared to
finance high-tech start-ups are not interested in backing companies that are
still trying to turn their ideas into businesses. This is understandable as
these companies' main assets wear shoes and can walk out of the door at
anytime. Most will only fund a company when it has already developed a
product that is ready to go to market.
Even then the transition from consultancy to making and marketing a product
is the most difficult phase of development.
Companies handle it in different ways. Crombie Anderson, a consultancy in
Dunfermline, Scotland and Denver, Colorado, has chosen to spin out the two
high-tech businesses it has incubated. But it has always kept its consulting
side as a separate business.
'Consulting is jobbing work. If you want to penetrate a market you have to
really focus,' says Douglas Anderson, managing director of the consultancy.
He is also chairman of Creos, which he spun out of the consultancy when it
received backing from venture capitalists Electra Innvotec and which makes
high-voltage power supplies for computerised tomography (CT) scanners.
'For this opportunity in medical imaging you have to have a team that is
really dedicated to that and nothing else,' he says.
The Technology Partnership experience is similar, though on a larger scale.
Formed when 25 consultants from PA Consulting Group left en masse in 1987,
it started with specialist consulting. As well as developing products for
others it started to make manufacturing equipment under contract, notably
for Celltech, the drug discovery company.
Celltech needed to make large quantities of a growth hormone, and asked The
Technology Partnership to make a robot that would replicate exactly the
human procedures approved by the US Food and Drug Administration.
The Technology Partnership has since updated the robot and set up a niche
business selling the equipment to biotechnology companies making, for
example, vaccines.
The next step was to form strategic partnerships to develop ideas generated
within the consultancy business. These have included a joint venture with a
corporate partner to develop an ink-jet printing technology and a project
with Analogue Devices of the US to design telecommunications chips for the
new GSM digital telephones spreading across Europe.
Lastly, The Technology Partnership has been able to dedicate two people for
18 months to a project that is developing vehicle power systems for electric
cars. This has led to the spin-out of a new business funded by a large
company.
'It is the service (consultancy) side of the business that allowed two
people to explore the possibility of a new approach to drives in electric
vehicles with potential partners and the car companies,' says Gerald Avison,
managing director of The Technology Partnership.
The consultancy started with a distinct advantage - it was quickly large
enough to free researchers from the daily grind of covering the business's
overheads with fee earning consultancy. But for smaller teams the transition
from consultancy to making a product is a difficult manoeuvre.
For 11 years after leaving Warwick University, Ron Jones, ran Ceramic
Developments as a consultancy. But even after re-mortgaging his house, his
company lacked critical mass. 'At the bottom of the recession we were
struggling to get product into the market,' says Jones. 'I had been managing
director for 11 years but we were short on the technical side and I needed
to get back to development.'
Like Creos, Jones was fortunate enough to raise venture capital from Electra
Innvotec. Jones returned to what he did best, R&amp;D, and the new managing
director began to focus the business on its most promising developments.
The company now has four products in the market, one of which is lightweight
ceramic armour used on the floor and seats of aeroplanes flying into Bosnia.
Jones says development plans and the need to provide investors with an exit
means the company (current sales roughly Pounds 2.5m) may be sold to a
larger company group in the next year.
Though Ceramic Developments could become part of a larger group, it has at
least joined the thin ranks of companies that have turned ideas into
businesses.
Some observers believe too many high-tech start-ups do not make this jump,
partly because funding for product development is inadequate. Alternatively
development is too slow - often also a result of inadequate funding. 'The
market window is often finite and not very wide,' says Gerald Avison. 'If a
product takes too long to develop it is no longer what the market wants.'
David Connell, who was on the UK government's Advisory Council for Science &amp;
Technology (ACOST) committee that looked at 'Barriers to Growth' in 1990,
believes many more high-tech companies could be successfully incubated in
the UK if there were more government support for the soft start-up. He has
two concrete recommendations.
First, the government could help by using the services of smaller
consultancies, which could then begin to develop a knowledge base. Second,
the government could try to find ways of supporting the transition to
production and marketing, such as regular competitions to promote good
ideas.
Neither seem likely so long as the government continues to believe
intervention is an unwelcome distortion of a market system that works.

FT  11 JAN 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Outsource boom for
in-house services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Aerospace does it. So does the Inland Revenue. And most companies in
the UK have either tried it, liked it or want to do it more. In the last
five years, outsourcing - the practice of contracting out services
previously done in-house - has become well established in British companies.
A survey of the country's largest public companies, by 3i, the investment
capital provider, suggests overwhelming support for outsourcing and 80 per
cent of those surveyed said there was scope for more. The survey suggests
that the smaller companies which often supply the services are likely to do
significantly more non-core activities for the larger companies.
Most companies said the greatest benefit was the management time that was
freed up, but also noted that outsourcing cut staff costs and increased
flexibility. Nearly half those surveyed said it also helped create greater
certainty about the level of costs. The greatest problem was maintaining the
quality of service and communications with the sub-contractors.
The most common service to be outsourced was, not unexpectedly, printing,
where three-quarters of companies have now stopped doing it themselves.
Travel services and pension management were almost as popular. More than
half those surveyed had outsourced software developments, public relations
functions and catering. At the other end of the scale, 1 per cent had
outsourced the accounting function, 5 per cent treasury management and 7 per
cent research and development. Most outsourcing was the result of decisions
taken on an ad hoc basis, suggesting the practice could spread still
further.
Three-quarters of the companies had not conducted a systematic review of the
opportunities. But two-thirds said they expected a further reduction in the
number of middle managers and believed new employment opportunities would
appear in the small and medium-sized sector of business. 'Small companies
can do the work more efficiently and cheaply and in many instances do it
better,' said Rupert Wiles, director of 3i.

FT  11 JAN 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Study shows fall in
buy-outs last year - In a Nutshell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The number of management buy-outs and buy-ins last year fell by a fifth over
the previous year. But the number of companies finding an exit either
through flotation or trade sales jumped to a record high.
The figures from the Centre for Management Buy-out Research at the
University of Nottingham suggest that while liquidity is returning to
buy-out financiers there may be a shortage of deals into which they want to
reinvest funds.
Nevertheless, Chris Ward, partner of Touche Ross Corporate Finance that
jointly finances the centre, is optimistic that investor appetite for deals
has been restored.
Buy-out failures were down by half to 50. There was also a fall in the
number of buy-outs from companies in receivership, suggesting more concerns
were starting their independent existence in stronger financial shape.
Buy-outs that needed to refinance during the year also fell.

FT  11 JAN 94 / Consumer credit drop may be obscuring trend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Consumer credit figures for November last year, published by the Central
Statistical Office yesterday, give mixed signals about the recent trends in
consumer spending.
Seasonally adjusted net lending to consumers in November was Pounds 290m,
down from Pounds 312m in October and below analysts' expectations. The main
culprit was finance houses' net lending, which was down to Pounds 262m from
Pounds 349m in October.
However, this contradicts figures from the Finance and Leasing Association,
published at the weekend, which showed an 8 per cent increase in lending
between the October and November figures.
Monthly statistics are always subject to distortion and, if one aggregates
the last three months' figures, the trend in the CSO statistics is positive.
Net lending in the three months to November was Pounds 1.09bn, up from
Pounds 642m in the three months to August and the highest three-monthly
figure since 1989.
The prospect of the November 30 Budget may have temporarily lessened
consumers' desire to spend. Figures for M0, usually a good indicator of
activity in the retail sector, have pointed to a pick-up in spending in late
December.
Figures for finance-house lending show that consumers were prepared to spend
on cars in November. New vehicle-related lending was Pounds 905m, up from
Pounds 758m in October.
November's credit figures show that net lending on bank credit cards picked
up, to Pounds 36m, after consumers repaid Pounds 31m of credit card debt in
October. New credit advanced on bank credit cards in November was a record
of Pounds 2.99bn.

FT  11 JAN 94 / Big media buyer supports planned television mergers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Carat, one of the UK's largest media-buying groups, yesterday backed mergers
between television companies in spite of fears that any further
concentration of advertising sales might be to the disadvantage of
advertisers.
The Office of Fair Trading has extended its scrutiny of Granada's Pounds
700m hostile bid for London Weekend Television to take in an examination of
the implications of the bid for the advertising sales market.
Mr Ray Kelly, chief executive of Carat (UK), said yesterday: 'If the
television companies we have in the UK are going to be able to compete
vigorously with media owners outside the UK then there is an absolute need
for them to start doing what they're doing now, which is to merge.'
Advertisers want to see the quality of programming maintained, said Mr
Kelly. TV companies are 'only really going to be capable of continuing to do
that if they're strong companies', he added. Carat's clients include Abbey
National, Cadbury, and United Distillers.
The OFT's move follows a submission from the Incorporated Society of British
Advertisers that a fall in the number of TV advertising selling points might
drive up prices.
Granada's and LWT's sales houses, which both sell for other TV companies,
account for more than 40 per cent of the ITV advertising market.
Zenith, another large media buyer, last night said TV ownership and
sales-house arrangements were distinct. Ms Christine Walker, Zenith chief
executive, said: 'A stronger ITV financially is a better ITV for the
advertisers.' She added, however, that advertisers would be 'justifiably
concerned' if advertising were concentrated.

FT  11 JAN 94 / Treasury rules out model sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Treasury has decided against privatising its computer model used in
economic forecasting, after more than a year of feasibility discussions,
Peter Marsh writes.
The decision, announced yesterday, was greeted as 'disappointing but
understandable' by DRI, the US-owned economics consultancy which last April
declared its interest in running the model.
Some economists have criticised faults in the model as being partly
responsible for poor Treasury forecasts in recent years.
Few UK economic consultancies said they were interested in taking over the
model because the work might be too complex and not profitable enough. The
Treasury said its decision had followed a recommendation by KPMG Peat
Marwick, the consultancy.

FT  11 JAN 94 / Labour attacks Tory tax 'hypocrisy'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, yesterday accused the prime minister
of 'hypocrisy and deceit' by scheduling 20 separate tax rises for the next
two years in spite of his party's general election pledge not to raise
taxation.
In the first assault of the new year on the government's economic policy, Mr
Brown outlined what he described as 'the hidden Tory tax calendar' at the
heart of the past two Budgets.
Citing weekend remarks by Mr John Major that the Tory party had no instinct
for tax rises, Mr Brown suggested that, from April this year, there would be
a tax rise every month until the end of 1994. This would, he claimed, amount
to an increase of Pounds 1,330 in tax for the typical family over the next
two years.
It was 'an extraordinary political own goal and an act of hypocrisy, broken
promises and deceit unrivalled in the history of taxation,' Mr Brown said.
He said the tax rises would hit the very groups in society which the
Conservatives had pledged at the last general election to protect from tax
increases. In many cases, he said, the increases would be larger than those
the Tories had suggested would be introduced by a Labour government.
For example, he said, a clinical nurse earning Pounds 13,250 would pay an
extra Pounds 791 in tax. In contrast, a Conservative general election
campaign advertisement had alleged that the extra burden under Labour would
be Pounds 479.
He also said that someone earning Pounds 15,000 a year would pay an extra
Pounds 811 under the proposed tax rises while the Conservatives had claimed
that, under Labour, the total tax rise would have been Pounds 647.

FT  11 JAN 94 / BBC to unveil reforms today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The BBC will today unveil a package of fundamental changes to pay,
conditions and grading in an effort to make the corporation more
competitive.
The changes flow from Producer Choice, the internal market in BBC services
launched last year. Producers now have control over their own budgets and
have the right to go outside the corporation to buy services.
The Producer Choice system, it is believed, has demonstrated that some BBC
business units, or departments, are uncompetitive compared with their
private-sector rivals. As a result, a number of managers have been seeking
greater flexibility on everything from pay and conditions to the
corporation's grading system.
The move will be seen as highly controversial by the broadcasting unions
because of the clear implication that a fragmentation of corporation-wide
terms and conditions of employment is about to be unleashed with the
possibility that some staff at least will be offered less attractive terms.
Details of the package are not yet known, but it is clear that the present
system of collective bargaining could be under threat.
The BBC would confirm yesterday only that there had been talks on pay and
conditions. It declined to say anything before today, when the process of
briefing staff will begin.
Apart from some differences in terms in separate business units, it is
believed the package will involve an element of performance-related pay.
Apart from the effects of Producer Choice, which the BBC claims has already
contributed to savings of more than Pounds 100m, the pressure for financial
change at the BBC is coming from the effects of nearly flat licence-fee
income growth and some rising costs.
The years of transition from black-and-white licence fees to colour meant
sustained growth in BBC income in real terms. That process is now complete
although the Government recently agreed that the licence fee would be linked
to retail prices for the last three years of the BBC's existing royal
charter, which runs out at the end of 1996.
Mr John Birt, director-general, promised to turn the BBC into a model public
corporation in Extending Choice, the corporation's vision of its future. Mr
Birt said in a recent interview that Producer Choice had revealed that some
areas were still overmanned and that further redundancies were necessary,
but he declined to say how many.
A government white paper on the future of the BBC is expected in the next
couple of months as part of the decision-making process on the renegotiation
of the corporation's royal charter
In November the BBC said it was seeking to make further efficiency gains of
13 per cent over the next three years and that savings would have to be made
across the board.

FT  11 JAN 94 / Trade statistics defended as deficit declines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Recent trade figures may be more accurate than had previously been thought,
the Central Statistical Office said yesterday. It reported a visible trade
deficit of Pounds 578m for October last year, down from Pounds 1.1bn in
September.
Trade with European Union countries has been recorded under the new
Intrastat system since the single market was introduced at the beginning of
1993. Doubts about the accuracy of the new system have been widespread.
During the period October 1992 to October 1993, the volume of UK imports
from non-EU countries showed an 11 per cent rise while imports from the EU
were recorded as falling by 8 per cent.
This led many to believe that the Intrastat system might be under-recording
EU imports.
However, the CSO believes that, before the introduction of the Intrastat
system, some imports were mis-recorded as coming from the EU.
This probably occurred when ships docked at main ports such as Rotterdam
before transferring goods to the UK. The 'point of origin' of such goods was
then described as being European instead of being from, say, the Far East.
Under the Intrastat system, which is linked to the collection of value added
tax, such imports are now correctly being recorded as from the rest of the
world.
As evidence for this theory, the CSO points to the pattern of trade with the
Benelux countries (figures for in-dividual EU countries are reported for the
first time this month).
In the 10 months to October 1992, the UK recorded a visible trade deficit
with the Benelux group of Pounds 1bn; in the 10 months to October 1993,
there was a surplus of Pounds 300m. This, the CSO believes, may help explain
the apparently aberrant trade patterns of recent months.
Figures for the UK's trade with the EU are now reported later than those for
the rest of the world. The visible trade deficit with non-EU countries in
October, at Pounds 372m, had already been announced; yesterday's figures
revealed that the deficit with the EU was Pounds 206m.
Recent trade figures have been fairly erratic with a sharp improvement in
August, a deterioration in September and a pick-up again in October. The
non-EU balance worsened once more in November, with a deficit of Pounds
767m. If the three months to October are aggregated, however, the combined
deficit at Pounds 2.1bn is substantially lower than the May-July
three-monthly figure of Pounds 3bn.
Exports in October were a new record, at just over Pounds 10.5bn, while
imports were Pounds 11.1bn. The September figures were Pounds 10.3bn and
Pounds 11.4bn respectively.
However, the October figures were helped by a Pounds 536m surplus on oil and
erratic items, such as aircraft and precious stones.
If oil and erratics are excluded, the October deficit was Pounds 1.1bn
compared with Pounds 1.4bn in September. In volume terms, exports were up
3.8 per cent on September, while imports rose 0.4 per cent.
Meanwhile, the DHL Quarterly Export Indicator, based on interviews with
directors of 501 UK companies, found that UK manufacturers were more
confident about long-term export sales than at any time in the past two
years.

FT  11 JAN 94 / Construction figures point to housing market upturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Further evidence of a sustained recovery in the housing market emerged
yesterday with publication of the latest construction figures from the
Department of the Environment.
These showed that the number of new homes started by builders rose during
the first 11 months of last year by almost 20 per cent to 175,000 compared
with the corresponding period in 1992.
This already makes 1993 the best year for housing starts since 1989 when
builders commenced work on 201,000 homes. By 1992 this annual total had
slipped to just 156,500.
Mr Joe Dwyer, chief executive of Wimpey, one of Britain's biggest
housebuilders, said yesterday: 'The latest figures are encouraging and
confirm our own experience that a steady improvement is under way.
'But price increases are still restrained and are likely to remain so, not
least, because of the impact of Budget measures on consumers' pockets which
take effect in the spring. Nevertheless, the trend is positive and I am
increasingly hopeful that this momentum can be maintained.'
Housing starts are regarded as one of the best guides to sales by the
industry, which takes about 12 weeks on average to construct a home.
The number of private-sector homes commenced during the first 11 months of
last year rose by 18.6 per cent to 134,300. This compares with 120,000
private starts for the whole of 1992. Construction of homes for housing
associations also jumped last year with starts rising during the first 11
months by a quarter to a record 39,300. This compared with a previous best
of 33,800 starts for the whole of 1992.
Builders say cuts in government spending mean that sales to housing
associations are likely to fall during the next 12 months. Yet this decline
is expected to be more than offset by increased sales to the private sector.
Sir George Young, housing minister, said yesterday: 'Houses are now more
affordable than they have been for many years, and with the prospect of
modest price rises next year, I would expect to see that reflected in
increased housing starts.'

FT  11 JAN 94 / Barclays union threatens action
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Barclays Group Staff Union, which has about 50,000 members, will decide soon
whether to take industrial action over the decision by Barclays Bank to cut
a further 3,000 jobs over the next two years. The decision will follow an
emergency meeting of the staff union's regional chairmen next week.
The Bifu banking union, which has about 12,000 members at the bank, said
industrial action was 'a real possibility'. The union is particularly
concerned that a much higher proportion of the job losses will come from
compulsory redundancies than in previous cuts.
Bifu also issued a warning that thousands of other job losses in the sector
were coming, with statements from two other financial institutions expected
this week.
The Barclays announcement takes the total of job losses in the bank's
five-year programme to 21,000 - 16 000 have already gone. Barclays said it
believed there was still some scope for voluntary redundancies. It would
resort to compulsory redundancies only 'when other avenues have been fully
explored'.

FT  11 JAN 94 / Left seeks to lead Revenue union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The broad left is mounting a serious challenge to capture the top job in the
Inland Revenue Staff Federation, the 57,000-strong tax officers' union.
As a postal ballot for the post of general secretary began yesterday, the
present leader Mr Clive Brooke is coming under attack from Mr John Ellis, a
tax official from Crewe, Cheshire, who sits on the executive.
Mr Ellis is calling for 'an immediate change of direction' in the union by
launching a campaign of lawful industrial action against the government's
plans to market-test and privatise Inland Revenue services.
'The purpose of such a campaign is to force our bosses around a real
negotiating table,' said Mr Ellis, who also wants a shorter working week for
tax officers, increased annual leave, and job security through redeployment.
Mr Ellis is calling for a 'pro-active agenda rather than one where the union
does nothing more than react and accommodate the Inland Revenue's agenda'.
He wants a leadership that 'can relate to members' fears, anger and
aspirations'.
Although Mr Brooke also opposes the government's plans, he argues that
industrial action is 'only one' of many weapons the union can use to defend
its members. He says disruption 'should never be taken for its own sake'
because there is 'no point in winning a glorious defeat'.
'I stand for practical steps to defend members rather than to expose them to
real risks to their jobs,' said Mr Brooke. He added that the union had taken
industrial action over market-testing under his leadership, but had also
sought to persuade the government to change direction.
He said no Revenue staff had suffered compulsory redundancy, national pay
bargaining had been maintained and there had been pay rises, not freezes,
for staff during the past five years.

FT  11 JAN 94 / Bill on business rates faces disruption by Labour MPs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The bill setting the level of business rates for the coming financial year
will be a target for Labour MPs when they return to Westminster today to
continue their procedural 'trench warfare' against the government.
Labour leaders decided to withdraw customary co-operation between government
and opposition over the handling of legislation just before Christmas.
Ministers used the parliamentary guillotine to force through two
controversial bills through all their stages on successive days.
Some of the anger fuelled by what Mr John Smith and his shadow cabinet
colleagues believe was an abuse of parlia - mentary process surfaced in the
House of Lords yesterday. Baroness Turner of Camden, chief Labour speaker in
the debate on the bill providing for Pounds 1.9bn additional revenue from
employees' National Insurance contributions, warned that it would require
increased scrutiny because of its 'rushed passage' through the Commons.
She stressed that, but for the need to comply with constitutional
convention, Labour peers would have voted against the second reading of the
bill.
Labour MPs will have an early opportunity to harass ministers seeking to
speed through vital legislation when a procedural motion relating to the
non-domestic rating bill is discussed later today. They will have even more
scope tomorrow when the bill is due for its second reading.
Mr Tony Newton, leader of the Commons, has already underlined the importance
of ensuring that the bill is not unduly delayed in order to avoid businesses
facing uncertainty over rate bills for the coming financial year.
The statutory sick-pay bill - the other measure whose rapid passage through
the Commons triggered the declaration of non-co-operation - is due for its
second reading in the Lords today.
It is designed to save the Treasury about Pounds 750m by ending the
arrangements for reimbursing employers for about 80 per cent of the cost of
statutory sick pay.

Plans to open the milk market in England and Wales to competition on April 1
were shelved yesterday. The Milk Marketing Board failed to overcome
remaining government objections to its proposals to become a producer
co-operative.
Postponement of the board's demise was agreed at a meeting between Mr Andrew
Dare, chief executive, and government officials.
'Because of the lead time that we need to make all the necessary
arrangements, we're not going to hit April 1,' said Mr Peter Morgan, the
board's head of corporate affairs.
Time is needed in particular for the partial flotation of Dairy Crest, the
board's dairy products subsidiary, which has to take place first in order to
provide working capital for the new co-operative, Milk Marque.
The board, which for 60 years has bought all milk from farmers in England
and Wales, selling it on to dairy companies, must now propose a new date for
market liberalisation. It is believed to favour July 1.
'We won't want to delay any longer than is necessary, but neither will we
want to rush into putting forward another date if there's a risk we can't
honour it,' said Mr Morgan. The government last month challenged key aspects
of the board's plans, saying they could be anti-competitive.
Questions were raised over the proposed bulk transfer of assets, milk
records and haulage contracts from the board to the new body, the way milk
would be auctioned to dairy companies and the requirement that farmers who
joined Milk Marque should give 12 months' notice if they wanted to leave.
Mrs Gillian Shephard, agriculture minister, moved quickly yesterday to
dispel concern among farmers about the uncertainty that has been created
over the future of milk marketing.
'We have made such good progress on outstanding issues that I'm confident we
shall come to a good agreement,' she said. 'However, the issues raised are
very complex ones affecting 30,000 milk producers, 50m consumers and an
industry valued in billions of pounds.
'The most important thing is to ensure the successor arrangements for the
Milk Marketing Board are right.'
A further meeting will be held on January 24, when both sides hope remaining
problems can be resolved.

FT  11 JAN 94 / Southwark calls in private sector to help rebuild estates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Private-sector developers are involved in radical plans for a
public/private-sector consortium to tackle one of London's most serious
concentrations of poor-quality council housing.
Under the proposals being discussed by Southwark council and the Department
of the Environment, about 1,000 homes in the five south London estates of
North Peckham, Gloucester Grove, Willowbrook, Camden and Sumner could be
demolished. The land would be used to build houses for sale and to rent
through housing associations, with the remaining council homes refurbished.
The comprehensive regeneration project - which involves one of the
highest-density population concentrations in the south-east - would be
financed by capital from the private sector, the Housing Corporation, the
government and the local authority.
Costs are still being worked out, but would be considerable. Proposals in
1990 for refurbishment of Gloucester Grove and North Peckham through a
Housing Action Trust - which would have taken the estates out of
Labour-controlled Southwark council's control - would have cost about Pounds
112m at 1988 prices. The plan was rejected by tenants.
Southwark council and the government are investing Pounds 52m in
improvements at three of the estates, and the council estimates that work at
North Peckham alone will need a further Pounds 48m.
An environment department conference on estate regeneration and the private
sector on Friday will be told that Southwark has successfully interested
private-sector developers - including Barrett and John Laing - in the
possibility of joining a consortium to change the social and economic nature
of the area.
An average of 87 per cent of families are council tenants - rising to 99 per
cent on some estates - and it is planned to reduce this to 60 per cent by
the end of the decade.
The urgent need for a more broadly balanced population on the estates, where
unemployment rates are about 27 per cent, is emphasised in a Southwark
report on the future of the retail centre at Peckham. 'New housing for sale
is vital if Peckham is to stand any chance of retaining its role as a centre
even within the borough,' it says.
Population density would be cut from 438 per hectare to 350 through
substantial demolition of blocks. New homes would be built for sale or rent
through housing associations.
Gloucester Grove and North Peckham estates have presented problems ever
since they were built in the 1970s. They have suffered from inadequate
design and high levels of deprivation and crime.
The estates suffer serious economic and social problems in spite of being
within two miles of central London, which should increase their appeal to
private developers.
The council envisages working with two to four housebuilders and up to six
housing associations. Many residents would have to move to enable the
development to take place.
Mr John Johnson, who chairs Southwark's economic development committee,
said: 'A scheme of this scale would work only with tenants' support, and
they are understandably suspicious. But I think they are also realistic, and
appreciate that there will be few other opportunities for improving the
environment.'

FT  11 JAN 94 / Water pollution hearing soon
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Victims of the Camelford water pollution incident have received a High Court
date for civil actions claiming their health suffered as a result of events
in the Cornish town almost six years ago.
The hearing into claims by 11 nominated people will open in May at the Crown
Court in Truro before Mr Justice Wright.
After about two weeks the hearing is expected to move to London for expert
evidence, expected to last a further three weeks.
About 139 other claims are likely to depend on the hearing's outcome. Water
supplies to 20,000 people were affected in the incident.
The pollution happened when a relief lorry driver dumped 20 tonnes of
aluminium sulphate into the wrong tank at a South West Water Authority
treatment works in July 1988.
The actions have been brought against South West Water Services, a
wholly-owned subsidiary of South West Water which, though it was only
created in 1989, assumed civil responsibility from the water authority which
it succeeded.
The authority was convicted at Exeter in 1991 of causing a public nuisance
and was fined Pounds 10,000 with Pounds 25,000 costs.
The SWWA was cleared of polluting the river Camel by flushing the mains at
midnight on the day of the incident because the judge said it was the only
action open to the authority.
The claims are for 'chronic and acute injuries arising out of the incident',
said Camelford-based solicitor Mr John Whiting, whose firm is representing
about 120 claimants.
They will allege that the water authority failed to provide wholesome water,
was in breach of its statutory duty and was negligent. This led to short and
long-term health problems, primarily long-term memory loss.
Mr Whiting said there had been 'nominal offers of settlement' in relation to
short-term sicknesses but responsibility had not been accepted for the
medium and long-term symptoms.
South West Water said 75 per cent of all claims, involving several hundred
people, had been settled.

FT  11 JAN 94 / Vocational body hits back at jibe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The quango responsible for developing the new system of vocational
qualifications in England and Wales yesterday hit back at a senior academic
who described the system as a 'disaster of epic proportions'.
The National Council for Vocational Qualifications said in a 36-point
statement that a report from a team headed by Professor Alan Smithers of the
Centre for Education and Employment Research at Manchester University, was
'inaccurate and misleading'.
The council and Prof Smithers disagree over the work-based national
vocational qualifications (NVQs) and the general national vocational
qualifications (GNVQs) which are intended to be 'vocational A-levels'. Prof
Smithers claimed yesterday that he had received several hundred letters and
telephone calls, and that most has said: 'Thank goodness somebody has spoken
out.'
Prof Smithers claims that the new qualifications are based on what a student
can do, with little formal regard for knowledge or theory acquired about the
subject. Written examinations are, for example, not compulsory for NVQs.
The council said it had received support from many organisations. It said
that, if candidates were unable to present evidence of competence through
performance alone, it might be necessary to collect evidence of their
possession of 'the essential underpinning of knowledge and understanding'.

FT  11 JAN 94 / Tories fail to answer basic questions: A party braced for
further disclosures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's back-to-basics initiative was mired in a philosophical
quagmire yesterday as Tory MPs struggled to agree on a moral framework for
the campaign.
The party appeared deeply split as some ministers insisted the initiative
was not aimed at personal morality, while others said it ought to be.
Ominously for Mr John Major, the prime minister, both rightwing moralists
and normally supportive liberals were saying privately that the issue had
been badly handled.
The party is bracing itself for the possibility of further disclosures about
the private lives of those MPs perceived by elements of the media and some
constituency activists to be guilty of moral turpitude.
To add to Mr Major's problems, MPs return to Westminster today for the start
of a parliamentary session which was always expected to be difficult for the
government.
Moral issues will come under the Commons spotlight early in the session when
MPs debate whether to reduce the age of consent for homosexuals from 21 to
either 18 or 16.
The government will also introduce two controversial law and order measures
 -the Police and Magistrates' Courts bill and the Criminal Justice bill -
described by Mr Major as crucial to back-to-basics.
In addition ministers will have to decide whether to accept demands for
changes to the education bill - another back-to-basics measure - following a
frosty reception in the Lords at the end of the last parliamentary session.
However, the government's most important task will be to agree on a way to
clarify the aims of back-to-basics and defuse attacks by constituency
activists on the behaviour of some MPs.
Ministers were sending confusing signals yesterday, suggesting that the
government is still groping towards a coherent moral framework for the
initiative three months after it was launched at the Conservative party
conference.
Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, said the campaign was 'not about drawing
up a check-list for individual behaviour in every set of circumstances
because that is not something which governments can or should do'.
Mr William Waldegrave, the Citizens' Charter minister, also said the
government had 'better things to do' than to lecture voters on private
morals. But Mr John Redwood, the Welsh secretary, and Mr John Patten,
education secretary, both said moral issues were important to the
government.
Mr Patten said: 'I always feel a child who is brought up without a father
suffers terribly. It doesn't matter whether they are married or not - I
prefer them to be married myself - but I think the fathers should be there.'
But it was this sort of language, employed by rightwing ministers such as Mr
Peter Lilley, social security secretary, and Mr Michael Portillo, chief
secretary to the Treasury, which caused back-to-basics to be seen as a moral
crusade.
Dame Jill Knight, a vice-chairman of the influential 1922 committee of Tory
backbenchers, said moral issues were a 'narrow but extremely important
aspect of responsibility'.
Mr Bill Cash, a leading rightwing critic of the prime minister, said a
policy based on traditional family values was sustainable 'despite the fact
that a number of people seem to have wandered off course'.
There were nervous references at Westminster yesterday to 1963, when the
Profumo scandal did much to prepare the ground for a Labour general election
victory.
For the moment, however, the controversy is merely embarrassing for the
government, rather than dangerous. The spate of disclosures about MPs in the
past week has shaken ministers, but party managers believe the damage can be
contained as long as the revelations end soon.

FT  11 JAN 94 / Press watchdog widens its remit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Press Complaints Commission is to abandon its controversial rule that
stops investigation of most breaches of the newspaper industry's code of
practice when there is no complainant.
The rule has led to embarrassing inconsistencies. Some complaints by third
parties have not been pursued even though, in some cases involving members
of the royal family, the commission has intervened when no complaint has
been made.
The commission will now change its articles of association to make it much
easier to adjudicate on third party complaints.
The issue came to a head over commission plans to appoint Professor Robert
Pinker, one of its members, as privacy commissioner. Prof Pinker will remain
a member and continue to adjudicate on general complaints, but he will also
head any investigations into unnecessary invasions of privacy. He will also
have the right to start his own inquiries. His work will be done under
commission auspices, and he will submit his recommendation to the full
commission.
In extreme cases of breaches of the rules on privacy, the privacy
commissioner will be able to recommend that publishers take disciplinary
action against the editors responsible.
The move is the response of the newspaper industry to complaints from Mr
Peter Brooke, the national heritage secretary.
Following the Daily Mirror's publication of unauthorised pictures of the
Princess of Wales exercising in a gym, Mr Brooke said stronger measures were
needed to protect privacy although he accepted that the self-regulatory body
had performed well in dealing with press inaccuracies.
Mr Brooke said at the time that the government would 'take into account the
failure that has occurred' over the Mirror affair when examining the scope
for criminal or civil remedies to protect personal privacy.

FT  11 JAN 94 / Gas price rise hits big users
</HEADLINE>

   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Gas is to raise the price of one and two-year interruptible gas
contracts by an average 6 per cent from next month, David Lascelles writes.
Interruptible contracts enable large consumers to buy gas at cheaper rates.
They do so in the knowledge that they might be cut off at short notice.
There are about 1,000 customers in the interruptible market, some of them
the largest gas consumers in the country, including power stations.
Mr Norman Blacker, director of the UK gas business, said factory gate prices
had increased by 9 per cent over the past two years, but interruptible
prices had fallen by more than 25 per cent in real terms since British Gas
was privatised in 1986.
'It is important that our prices in this market become more
cost-reflective,' he said.

FT  11 JAN 94 / Business failures 'show 46% fall'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The number of UK business failures in the final quarter of 1993 fell to the
lowest level since 1989, say estimates released yesterday by Trade
Indemnity, the credit insurance group.
Failures encountered by Trade Indemnity's policyholders fell by 46 per cent
in the fourth quarter compared with the same period in 1992. The group
registered 942 business failures in the final three months of 1993, a 21 per
cent fall on the previous quarter.
Trade Indemnity said the figures showed a radical change in the UK business
climate. 'Whilst there is usually a seasonal increase in the first quarter
of the new year, it is clear that companies are at last able to concentrate
their minds on expansion rather than simply survival,' the company said.
Trade Indemnity warned that companies' cashflow still remained under
pressure. 'The overriding message from our policyholders at present is one
of margins continuing to be squeezed between price pressure from customers
and higher-cost supplies.'
The company said its statistics tended to reflect failure trends of more
established companies. It said evidence suggested its statistics often led
other available indicators by as much as six months.

FT  11 JAN 94 / Ageing culvert takes the strain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY and MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In spite of a respite from heavy rain yesterday the county town of
Chichester in West Sussex was last night bracing itself for the possibility
that its historic centre could be awash with floodwater by the weekend.
The River Lavant, a normally placid waterway which has not misbehaved for at
least 100 years, is threatening to burst into the High Street.
Ms Teresa Cash, spokesperson of the National Rivers Authority for the
southern region, said: 'There has been seven inches of rain since New Year's
Eve. Normally there is five inches of rain in the whole of January.'
There are two main threats. The Lavant has already burst its banks twice
since New Year's Eve, flooding the eastern end of the city of 20,000 people.
Twelve families have been evacuated, and although shops have not closed they
are all protected by sandbags. The Sainsbury's supermarket has become an
island and several petrol stations are under water.
The A27 to Brighton has been closed and the road south to Bognor Regis is
virtually impassable.
But the more significant and immediate threat is to the city centre. The
Lavant river divides at a point called The Hornet in the east of the city
and goes through a culvert under the city centre.
Much of this culvert was built 100 years ago and is under great stress.
Ms Jane Gale, emergency planning officer for the county council, said last
night: 'There doesn't seem to be any danger at the moment. A lot depends on
what the fire brigade and the army manage to do. However, no one knows what
the culvert can stand.'
The river level fell yesterday, but the city is bracing itself for downpours
forecast towards the end of the week.
In addition to the main new pipeline that is carrying 2m gallons of water
daily away from the culvert to the sea, a further five pipes carry
floodwater into drainage ditches around the city.
A dam made of sandbags is being constructed on the east of the Lavant to
contain the flooding in the area of the city around The Hornet. A further
channel made of sandbags is under discussion which could carry a further 2m
gallons a day from the Hornet, down Market Road and then back into the
river.
The council says it cannot estimate the cost of the work and the damage at
this point.
In the area of greatest flooding the peak flow of the Lavant has been about
30m gallons a day. It has subsided to between 12m and 15m gallons a day.

inside the centre at a computer terminal he was using for about Pounds 3.50
an hour. Apart from novel-writing he has a little publishing business. 'The
telecentre facilitates that immensely - you can do the design, the
typesetting, the lot yourself,' he said.
The telecentre in Kington, Hereford and Worcester, stuffed with more than
Pounds 250,000 of electronics, has in three months become the focal point
for the Connected Community Project - the shop window of the attempt to
stimulate the economy of a small country town by the application of the
latest high-technology.
The leading partners in this experiment of creating an electronic community
are the Department of Trade and Industry and the Rural Development
Commission, both of whose motives are to foster economic growth. Other
leading partners are British Telecommunications and Apple Computer, which
are looking for new ways of selling equipment and services.
Kitting out the telecentre is a continuing business. 'We've done something
called future proofing. As equipment gets faster this network won't get
outdated,' explained Mr Keith Harris, Kington's technical director.
The installation of cabling and equipment has been done to make future
change easy. 'You don't have to rewire the building to change the position
of a telephone,' he said.
The telecentre has drawn the curious to such an extent that, to allow the
serious to carry on working, it is now closed during the mornings for those
dropping in casually.
'We expected the level of interest in the centre would grow organically, but
it's been a bang,' said Mr Miles Swinburne, the Kington project manager.
'We're having to introduce booking times.'
Word processing and desktop-publishing courses, taking place at the
telecentre until a full-scale training centre can be set up, are three-times
subscribed. Youngsters are coming in on Saturday mornings. 'We're teaching
the kids to build a picture,' said Mr Lawrence Smith, a local art teacher.
Anybody with the right equipment at home can pay a subscription, link with
centre, be given storage space in the telecentre's computers and become part
of the electronic mailing system.
The telecentre is also a gateway to the the world through BT's newly
installed Integrated Services Digital Network - phone lines which can
transmit almost instantaneously text, data, voice and image.
The development of the centre, after of public meetings in Kington last
summer extolling the potential benefits of a high-technology infusion,
created expectations which Mr Swinburne and Mr Harris, the only two people
paid full-time by the project company, cannot easily meet.
The project has 34 Macintosh computers provided by Apple but, said Mr
Swinburne: 'People believed we had 100 machines in a cupboard and we are
mean bastards not letting them out.'
Of those 34 machines, 16 are in the telecentre, six are destined for the
training room, and six are in local schools. For the rest, progress in
getting them installed and running around the community has been slower than
Mr Swinburne had expected during the planning days of last summer.
This is partly explained by the concentration of effort on the telecentre
and partly by delays in the training of those who will use them in the first
instance.
Three machines, for example, will be used by a chain of local sports shops
to control stocks, but the retailers themselves have had to concentrate on
the Christmas trade rather than computer training.
But the work of finding computer applications relevant to the economic
development and commercial growth of Kington has not stopped.
Just as Ms Lowes is trying to work up her nutrition database, so Ms Ann
Pollock is working on a tourism project which would computerise and make
available according to demand information such as traffic flows and future
local attractions. Mr Richard Hammond is working on the computerisation of
farm accounts.
Now that the project is moving out of the teething-trouble phase, the method
of funding it has started to change. Kington Connected Community is
dependent not just on the four main sponsors but also on the Hereford and
Worcestershire Training and Enterprise Council and the Leominster District
Council.
'They're moving quickly from chucking money in the pot to project-driven
funding,' said Mr Swinburne, citing work that the project has received from
the district council to computerise information for housing-tenants
associations.
But, against the background of a so far feeble revenue stream, he warned
that 'all documentation on this tells you it takes about three years to be
self-financing'.

FT  11 JAN 94 / Institutions to finance lottery bid by Rank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Rank Organisation plans to bid for the National Lottery licence with
finance largely provided by a consortium of institutional investors.
Mr Michael Gifford, chief executive of the leisure group, has reached
agreement in principle with a range of large UK institutions, said to be
household names.
If it won the licence Rank would be the operating company. It would probably
hold a minority of the equity, and choose all suppliers by tender.
Although Rank is a serious contender, it is unlikely to announce formally
its intention to bid much before the February 14 deadline.
Meanwhile Ladbroke, the hotel and leisure group, and MAI, the television,
financial services and market research group, confirmed their intention to
bid, unveiling a heavyweight board for the joint venture known as Games For
Good Causes.
Mr Malcolm Hughes, managing director of Vernons, the Ladbroke-owned football
pools company, will be chief executive of the lottery consortium.
He said yesterday that the National Lottery might eventually raise nearly
Pounds 1bn a year for good causes and Pounds 500m for taxpayers. This
implies annual revenues of about Pounds 4bn.
He also promised that, if successful, the operation would be based in
Liverpool, home of Vernons, although it would be independent of the pools
organisation.
The consortium is chaired by Sir Christopher Benson, chairman of Boots. Lord
Hesketh, former government chief whip in the Lords, is deputy chairman.
The board also includes Sir Michael Lickiss, a senior partner in Grant
Thornton, the accountants, Sir Michael Jenkins, an executive director of
Kleinwort Benson, and Ms Elizabeth Filkin, the Inland Revenue's independent
adjudicator, who would act as a lottery ombudsman.
Ladbroke and MAI would each take a third of the equity with the rest being
offered to institutional investors.
All the consortium's technology would be supplied by the UK subsidiary of
AT&amp;T/NCR, the communications and computing group, which would draw on the
lottery equipment of Automated Wagering International of the US.
Sir Christopher said yesterday that the consortium was 'looking at a high
street operation' but declined to say whether this might include Boots. He
promised Games For Good Causes intended to be 'as open as we can' on its
application after the bids have gone in.
Eight consortia have so far indicated serious plans to bid for the lottery
licence with signs of two further 'dark horses' in the wings.

FT  11 JAN 94 / Ex-BCCI manager to face charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Swaleh Naqvi, formerly the second ranking manager at the collapsed Bank
of Credit and Commerce International, is expected to be charged with fraud
by the US authorities and stand trial later this year, the US Justice
Department said yesterday.
Mr Naqvi will face Federal fraud charges brought in the District of
Columbia, Mr Gerald Stern, the Justice Department's special counsel for
financial institution fraud, said.
If acquitted there, Mr Naqvi could then face separate charges brought in
state courts in New York, Georgia and Florida, Mr Stern added.
The move follows the agreement reached over the weekend between the US
authorities and the Abu Dhabi government.
Under this, a civil action against Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan, the Abu Dhabi
ruler, is to be dropped in exchange for allowing US prosecutors access to Mr
Naqvi.
The prosecution would be the first to be brought in the US against a senior
Bank of Credit and Commerce International official.
It follows last year's acquittal of Mr Robert Altman, a Washington lawyer
accused of fraud over the BCCI takeover of First American, and the dropping
of charges against Mr Clark Clifford, the former US defence secretary.
The deal will also give a kickstart to US inquiries into others suspected in
the BCCI fraud, which have stalled in recent months.
Abu Dhabi, the bank's majority shareholder, has agreed to hand US
investigators the 'Naqvi files', representing more than 1m papers which
detailing how BCCI perpetrated one of the biggest banking frauds in history.
Mr Naqvi has been under house arrest in Abu Dhabi since late in 1991. He
will be handed over to the US authorities within 120 days.
In legal moves in London, Sheikh Khalid bin Mahfouz, the former chief
operating officer in London of National Commercial Bank of Saudi Arabia,
yesterday issued a High Court writ claiming up to Dollars 10.5bn (Pounds
7bn) from the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority.
The Sheikh alleges that both the authority and its senior official, Mr
Ghanim Faris Al Mazrui, were knowing parties to BCCI carrying on its
business with the intention of defrauding creditors.
The action is in effect seeking an indemnity for Sheikh Mahfouz in the event
of Touche Ross, the BCCI liquidators, winning a civil action against him for
Dollars 10.5bn.

FT  11 JAN 94 / Counties shake-up sparks confusion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Polls of residents of the next three counties to be restructured by Sir John
Banham's Local Government Commission have revealed deep confusion over the
local government review.
The commission will use the polls - by market research organisation MORI -
as evidence when drawing up its final proposals for the counties of
Humberside, Lincolnshire and North Yorkshire.
But the polls have proved totally contradictory. Majorities in all three
counties said they approved in principle of creating unitary authorities to
replace the current two-tier system of counties and districts. But their
single most popular option when presented with a range of alternatives was
to keep the status quo.
Unitary councils, which the government has backed since last September, are
opposed by 69 per cent of residents in North Yorkshire's Craven district
council, for which the local government minister, Mr David Curry, is the MP.
County councils said the confused figures showed that the case for change
had not been made, while district councils stressed the support for the
principle of unitary councils.
South of the Humber, maintaining the status quo was the favoured option of
38 per cent, while it was favoured by 33 per cent north of the river. In
both cases, the next most popular option was favoured by only 16 per cent.
Final recommendations will be published on January 24.
In another worrying development for the review, a Somerset district council
threatened to apply for judicial review of the commission's proposals.
Mendip, the only district to be split under current proposals, will decide
on Thursday whether it is to follow four counties in taking the commission
to the High Court.
The commission's recommendations on Cleveland also came under attack from
the Teesside Study Group of local businessmen and professionals. The group
criticised the proposal to create four unitary authorities, saying: 'Can
what was the smallest county in England afford four chief executives, four
social services departments, four directors of education and so on?'
Local Labour MPs backed the group's call for the commission to create two
unitary councils instead.
Ms Marjorie Mowlam, MP for Redcar, Mr Frank Cook, MP for Stockton North, and
Mr David Bowe, MEP for Cleveland and Yorkshire North, stated: 'There must
now be a very real suspicion that in reality what the commission is
proposing for this area would actually add to costs rather than produce even
limited savings.'

FT  11 JAN 94 / Race-row pair reprieved
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Liberal Democrat party was under fire from the Conservatives and Labour
yesterday after plans to expel two London councillors, accused of racism,
were dropped.
An inquiry set up by the party last month recommended that the two Tower
Hamlets councillors should be expelled for producing racist leaflets during
a by-election won by the British National party.
The councillors were reprieved after an appeal to the party's London region,
which accepted their apologies. A third councillor involved resigned from
the party.
Mr Matthew Taylor, the Liberal Democrat campaigns chairman, said the
decision was 'entirely consistent' with the appeal process envisaged by the
inquiry report.
He said the main author of the leaflets had given specific undertakings not
to stand as a candidate or produce campaign leaflets in future.
The Liberal Democrats also accused Labour of conducting a secret inquiry
into racist campaigning in the borough by Labour candidates.
'Our procedures have been followed openly, and explicit action has been
taken in line with the report. The contrast with the Labour party could not
be greater,' Mr Taylor said. Mr Jack Straw, Labour's environment spokesman,
said the decision not to expel the councillors was 'a major humiliation' for
Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader.
'This whole exercise has now been exposed as a cynical whitewash,' Mr Straw
said. 'I have no doubt that the London party acted as it did because it was
petrified that any members expelled would blow the whistle on the complicity
of senior members of the Tower Hamlets party about the use of the race
card.'
Mr Gerry Malone, deputy chairman of the Conservative party, said the
decision showed that the Liberal Democrats were 'willing to say or do
anything, however unscrupulous, to get elected'.

<TEXT>
About 135 flood warnings from the National Rivers Authority were in effect
throughout the south of England yesterday, including three red warnings for
areas where rivers threatened to burst their banks, Motoko Rich writes. The
three areas most at risk were: Chichester on the River Lavant, Arlesey on
the River Hiz near Bedford, and Blunham on the Ivel, also near Bedford.
There were reports of severe flooding along much of the south coast. A
leading firm of loss assessors said hundreds of properties were affected.
The firm said: 'We had to take a helicopter over the area (from Sussex to
Dorset). We could not get to it by vehicle.' It added that there was 'a lot
of devastation - houses, fields, roads, caravan parks, industrial estates,
large commercial areas, all under water. When you are in the air it looks
like one big lake.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The trial of Mr Mohammed Baqi, a director of Attock Oil International
charged with fraud over his alleged involvement with the collapsed Bank of
Credit and Commerce International, is set to start later this week.
Selection of the jury to try Mr Baqi began yesterday at the Old Bailey in
London. The jurors are expected to be formally sworn in today.
Mr Baqi faces 16 charges concerning the alleged furnishing of false
information about the finances of BCCI. The Serious Fraud Office, which has
brought the prosecution, alleges he conspired with members of the bank's
management to furnish documents which falsely indicated that the bank was
owed a total of Dollars 123m (Pounds 83m) by Attock Oil.
Mr Baqi denies all the charges. The trial is expected to last up to two
months.

<TEXT>
Quaker Oats, the breakfast cereal maker, is recalling 460,000 packs of Sugar
Puffs and Quaker Puffed Wheat, with a retail value of about Pounds 800,000,
after 'rough grain husks' which could irritate the throat were found in some
packs, Neil Buckley writes.
About 5,000 packs are believed to be affected by the problem, thought to be
the result of a breakdown in the sieving process. The company said there was
no danger to children or adults.
'However, these irregular shaped husks, which have rough edges, could cause
some throat discomfort and irritation, and small children could cough or
regurgitate them,' said Dr Gerry Jewell, quality-control director.
Packets affected are Sugar Puffs with a best before date of 30/11/94 and
batch codes L52-L90 marked on the packet top, or best before 31/12/94, batch
codes L01-L42, or Puffed Wheat best before 31/12/94, batch codes L16-18 and
L37-39.
Customers with such packs are advised to destroy the contents and send the
packet top with their name and address for a replacement voucher to Quaker
Oats, Dept 2000, Snowden Drive, Winterhill, Milton Keynes MK6 1HQ.

FT  11 JAN 94 / Gas price rise hits big users
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Gas is to raise the price of one and two-year interruptible gas
contracts by an average 6 per cent from next month.
Interruptible contracts enable large consumers to buy gas at cheaper rates.
They do so in the knowledge that they might be cut off at short notice.
There are about 1,000 customers in the interruptible market, some of them
the largest gas consumers in the country, including power stations.
Mr Norman Blacker, director of the UK gas business, said factory gate prices
had increased by 9 per cent over the past two years, but interruptible
prices had fallen by more than 25 per cent in real terms since British Gas
was privatised in 1986.
'It is important that our prices in this market become more
cost-reflective,' he said.
British Gas has been told by its regulators to allow more competition in the
contract market.
But though it has now lost 70 per cent of the firm contract business,
competitors have been slow to offer interruptible contracts because they
believe that British Gas prices have been too low.
This price increase, which has been agreed with Ofgas, the regulator, should
stimulate more competitor interest.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, and the European Commission
will today begin talks in the hope of reaching a deal on full liberalisation
of public procurement contracts by April 15.
The European Union, US and 10 other countries agreed in December to open up
lucrative public contracts to full competition in most areas from the
beginning of 1996.
But in spite of the impetus given by the parallel Uruguay Round talks on
global trade liberalisation, certain areas - including contracts offered by
local authorities and utilities below central government level - were left
out of the agreement.
The EU has said it will withhold full liberalisation of telecommunications
contracts, until the question of sub-federal contracts is resolved.
Mr Kantor yesterday discussed public procurement and other post-Round issues
with Sir Leon Brittan, the European trade commissioner, in what both sides
described as a 'stock-taking' of the Uruguay Round deal.
Mr Kantor and Sir Leon agreed that trade representatives from the 'Quad'
countries - the US, EU, Canada and Japan - should meet, possibly following
scheduled talks among Quad trade officials in Washington on January 19. The
US and EU are particularly eager to press on with the Gatt commitments on
opening up access to markets of the four trade partners.
Today, Mr Kantor will press the case for further public procurement
liberalisation in talks with Mr Raniero Vanni d'Archirafi, commissioner
responsible for the internal market, and Mr Martin Bangemann,
telecommunications commissioner.
The US has always argued that it is difficult to oblige individual states to
open their contracts to further competition. Instead, US officials said Mr
Kantor would promise to persuade sub-federal authorities to make voluntary
commitments to liberalisation.
The EU and US took their first step in April last year towards a deal on
public procurement by opening up markets for services and heavy electrical
equipment.

FT  11 JAN 94 / World Trade News: Ford, Mazda may produce European car
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DETROIT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ford and Mazda, the US and Japanese carmakers, are to begin negotiations
shortly which could lead to the produc tion of cars at a Ford plant in
Europe for sale under the Mazda badge in European mar kets.
The cars, modified versions of Ford products, could be built at one of
Ford's two plants in the UK, where it has significant excess capacity.
Mr Wayne Booker, Ford executive vice-president, international operations,
said European production for Mazda would be one of the priority issues to be
examined, as a result of the closer strategic relationship being developed
between the two groups.
Ford acquired a 25 per cent stake in Mazda in 1979 and the two groups
already have extensive links. Two weeks ago, with Mazda in loss and under
growing financial pressure, they announced these ties were to be
strengthened with closer co-operation mainly in product planning and
manufacturing.
The number of Ford-nominated directors of Mazda is being increased from four
to seven; four of these directors are to be appointed to management
positions including one as executive vice-president.
'One of the issues is how we help Mazda in Europe,' said Mr Booker in an
interview with the Financial Times. 'The degree of openness that should now
be established will allow a different way of evaluating the use of more Ford
products.'
Earlier talks between Mazda and Ford about European production for the
Japanese carmaker broke down in March last year after nearly four years'
fruitless talks. Mazda had previously held abortive talks with Saab of
Sweden.
The change in Ford's attitude towards collaborating with Mazda in Europe
stems from its high level of overcapacity in Europe, where it has been in
heavy losses for the past three years.
Mr Booker said Ford now had more spare capacity than envisaged 18 months
ago, because of the steep decline in new car demand in west Europe and gains
made by its own drive to increase productivity. The choice of Ford plant at
which cars would be produced for Mazda would depend on which product was
selected. 'It looks right now as if it would be Halewood or Dagenham (Ford's
two UK car assembly plants) rather than Saarlouis (one of Ford's two German
assembly plants).'

Winter conditions on the north Atlantic are rarely smooth but a dispute
between exporters and the shipping lines which link North America and Europe
has whipped up a storm.
Conferences - agreements between shipping lines to set prices on a
particular route - are a well-established means of introducing certainty
into a seasonal business requiring large capital investments. But one
newly-established conference, the Trans Atlantic Agreement, has set shippers
against the shipping lines and led to a dispute over the powers of the
European Council and the European Commission.
The TAA is an agreement between 15 large shipping lines, accounting for
about 85 per cent of sailings between northern Europe and the US, to
regulate both rates and capacity. Its members include many large container
shipping lines such as P&amp;O, Nedlloyd and Maersk.
The TAA came into effect in September 1992 and pushed up freight rates by as
much as 100 per cent, the shippers claim. The shipowners see in it a chance
to reduce their ruinous losses on the north Atlantic.
'When the cost of shipping a container across the Atlantic fell from Dollars
1,600 (Pounds 1,080) to Dollars 800 no-one jumped up and down to say that
the shipowners were losing a fortune,' comments Lord Sterling, chairman of
P&amp;O and president of the European Shipowners' Association.
'All the ship-owning companies are trying to do is to claw back their losses
and make sure they don't go bust.' The shipping lines estimate their losses
on the north Atlantic at Dollars 650m over the past four years.
The shippers, for their part, see the TAA as an attempt to extend the
normally accepted rules of conference agreements laid down by the United
National Conference on Trade and Development (Unctad). They regard it as a
dangerous precedent which, if the shipping lines can get away with it, could
be applied to other routes around the world.
Shippers' organisations have responded angrily to the creation of the TAA
and have lobbied hard for the European Commission to view it as an illegal
cartel. The British and French Shippers' Councils have condemned the TAA as
damaging European exports at a time of recession.
Guinness, the drinks group which ships large volumes of beer and whisky to
the US, estimates that the TAA has added up to Pounds 1.5m to its annual
shipping costs of between Pounds 15m and Pounds 20m. 'We face a monopoly
agreement which has already cost us a significant sum and which threatens to
cost us more in 1994,' said Mr Chris Scott-Wilson, head of European affairs.
'We are very concerned that the TAA can control freight rates and limit
capacity almost at will.'
The dispute centres on conflicting interpretations of regulation 4056 which
exempts liner conferences from European competition rules. Unusually, this
regulation, which took effect in 1987, was the work of the European council
of ministers and not the European Commission. This led to claims that when
the council considered the TAA at the end of last month it was usurping the
commission's powers.
In the event Mr Karel van Miert, commissioner in charge of European
competition policy, intervened. Last month he issued a statement of
objections to the TAA but invited the shipowners to consider a compromise.
The dispute between the shippers and the shipowners focuses on three aspects
of the TAA:
Its inclusion of the inland transport of cargoes to and from the ports. The
shippers argue that many shipping lines do not own road haulage companies
and do not make capital investments in this area.
The TAA argues that what are known as intermodal agreements are a
well-established and essential part of contracts. The fact that it seeks to
control capacity on the routes as well as rates. The shipowners counter that
they have taken surplus vessels out of commission and have reduced capacity
by 10 per cent over the past year. But there is still excess capacity of 15
per cent.
Permission for shipping lines to charge differential rates. The shippers say
this breaks the normal conference rules which require shipowners to charge
uniform rates. The shipowners argue that it is natural for TAA shipping
lines to charge varying prices because they offer different levels of
service.
Brussels has indicated that if the TAA makes permanent capacity reductions
it would look more favourably on the agreement. But it has recently taken a
tough line against other conferences which it felt breached the rules,
fining two cartels operating between Europe and Africa.

The growing taste in Japan for foreign-made cars last year boosted sales of
imported cars by more than 9 per cent, according to figures released
yesterday by the Japan Automobile Importers Association, writes Michiyo
Nakamoto in Tokyo.
Sales of imported vehicles rose 9.1 per cent from the previous year to
201,481 units, marking the first year-on-year rise in three years, the
association said.
However, the success of imported cars did not reflect a simple rise in
demand for foreign makes but was largely supported by increased sales of
cars made by Japanese carmakers at their overseas facilities, which rose by
48 per cent.
Honda, in particular, saw wide demand for its cars made in the US and sales
of Honda of America's vehicles jumped 36 per cent to 26,841 units. The
company, which has positioned the US as a world exporting base, expects to
raise exports from the US to 28 countries including Japan from 41,694 units
last year to 75,000 units in 1994.

FT  11 JAN 94 / World Trade News: EU directive on utilities 'could increase
prices'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Union's Utilities Directive could lead to higher prices for
electricity transmission and distribution equipment, dashing hopes that
competitive purchasing could reduce costs and benefit consumers, a report*
says today.
The controversial procurement directive, which came into force last January,
was a key weapon in the European Commission's battle to subject suppliers of
goods and services such as utilities to long-term competitive pressures.
The Commission has long believed that the tendency of public agencies to buy
equipment and services from domestic suppliers meant costs were higher than
if contracts had been allocated on the basis of full and fair international
competition, which the directive is aimed at encouraging.
However, a report by Mr Steve Thomas and Mr Francis McGowan of Sussex
University says the reverse could be the case for transmission and
distribution equipment.
'It may be that the time when procurement liberalisation measures could
prove useful has already passed and the rigidities a mandatory requirement
would impose could prove counter-productive,' it says. 'Given the
dangerously concentrated nature of the equipment supply industry, a much
greater threat to the economic welfare of consumers may be posed by
non-competitive forces in the equipment supply industry than is posed by the
policies of the electricity supply industry.'
In the past, says the report, electric utilities in France, Italy, Germany
and the UK could all choose from at least two domestic suppliers for most
big items of equipment. Now, following a series of cross-border mergers and
takeovers, the option of 'buying national' usually does not exist.
With further mergers still likely, no prospect of new equipment suppliers
being created and the 'worrying history of cartel behaviour' in the supply
industry, the assumption that it will always behave competitively looks
optimistic, says the report.
The directive also makes it more difficult for utilities to enter into
long-term agreements with suppliers to develop and purchase new designs of
equipment, ironically a practice that is increasingly common in other
industries, says the report. This could weaken the utilities' market power.

FT  11 JAN 94 / Perry likely to join Fed board
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Clinton administration has narrowed its choice for the next seat on the
Federal Reserve board to Mr George Perry, an economist at Washington's
Brookings Institution.
Although President Bill Clinton is understood not to have made his final
choice yet, his economic advisers have picked Mr Perry from a shortlist to
succeed Mr Wayne Angell, whose term of office as a Fed governor expires at
the end of this month.
Mr Perry, who was an economic adviser to former Vice-President Walter
Mondale in his 1984 election campaign, would, if finally selected by Mr
Clinton and confirmed by the Senate, be expected to be less hawkish than Mr
Angell.
Inflation has been one of the focuses of Mr Perry's academic work, but some
of his writings suggest he sees a trade-off between growth and inflation.
'The demand management chore confronting policymakers is not merely avoiding
excess demand, but rather choosing how much to accommodate inflation and how
much to give up in output and employment in order to suppress inflation,' he
wrote in an article on demand-pull inflation in an influential economics
dictionary.
Curiously, the administration, which has gone to great lengths to ensure
ethnic and gender diversity in other appointments, appears relatively
untroubled by the fact that Mr Perry is a white male. The Fed, whose seven
governors include just one woman and no blacks or Latinos, is probably the
institution whose diversity shortcomings are most glaring.
Mr Morton Halperin, whose nomination to the new post as head of peacekeeping
operations at the Pentagon was held up by Republican opposition in the
Senate, has withdrawn his candidacy. The White House had said it would
resubmit his nomination, which expired when Congress adjourned last year,
but yesterday said Mr Clinton had accepted Mr Halperin's withdrawal 'with
real regret'.
Mr Halperin's decision was prompted by the resignation of Mr Les Aspin as
defence secretary. He felt Mr Bobby Ray Inman, Mr Aspin's successor, should
have the freedom to select his own subordinates.

FT  11 JAN 94 / Salinas sacks interior minister
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Carlos Salinas fired Mexico's hardline interior minister yesterday
and put the foreign minister in charge of a commission to bring peace to the
troubled southern state of Chiapas.
The cabinet changes were the most dramatic response yet to last week's
uprising in Chiapas, in which more than 100 people have died. While the army
has gained virtual control of the area, the conflict continues in the hills
and jungle around the former rebel strongholds.
Mr Salinas replaced Mr Patrocinio Gonzalez Blanco Garrido, the outgoing
minister of the interior, with the reputable attorney-general, Mr Jorge
Carpizo. The foreign minister, Mr Manuel Camacho, resigned to take over a
non-governmental commission to bring peace to the area.
Mr Gonzalez, until last year governor of the state of Chiapas, has been
widely attacked for failing to anticipate the uprising in Chiapas, and for
his oppression of indigenous groups while running the state government. Mr
Carpizo is a respected former head of the government human rights commission
and national university.
The cabinet change came as Mexico's stock market experienced one of its
worse days in recent history. The market closed down 6.3 per cent in heavy
volume, its biggest one-day fall in more than four years. 'The market is
worried that the conflict in Chiapas may drag on and that it may not be
confined to Chiapas,' said Mr Timothy Heyman, head of Baring Securities in
Mexico City. 'The beginning of a dialogue would be construed as a very
positive signal.'
President Salinas said Mr Carpizo's mission would be to bring peace and
respect for the law to Chiapas, and ensure that the presidential elections
this August would be conducted according to the constitution and new
electoral law.
A government spokesman added that the removal of Mr Gonzalez sent a message
of conciliation to rebel groups. 'At the same time that the stranglehold is
being applied in the area of combat, the government is open to all avenues
of dialogue,' he said.
The government previously laid down conditions for talks with the rebels
that amounted to unconditional surrender. It is still not clear if the
government is willing to offer new conditions for negotiations.
The Defence Ministry said late on Sunday that the military base outside San
Cristobal de las Casas had come under renewed attack, and that on Friday
rebels had launched another offensive against the city of Ococingo.
Notimex, the state-owned news agency, reported two explosions next to a
communications tower in Chiapas on Sunday night and three that damaged an
electricity tower in the state of Mexico. The explosions followed four bombs
in Mexico City over the weekend.
Mr Samuel Ruiz, the bishop of San Cristobal, accepted a rebel request to
mediate in talks aimed at ending the uprising. Mr Rigobertu Menchu, the
Guatemalan Nobel prize winner for peace, rejected their offer.

FT  11 JAN 94 / Mexican inflation rate slowed to 8 per cent last year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mexico's inflation rate slowed to 8 per cent last year, the lowest annual
figure since 1972, writes Damian Fraser. This was nearly 3 percentage points
less than 1992's figure and came at the cost of stagnant economic growth,
which in the first nine months of the year was just 0.5 per cent.
The central bank reported that December's inflation rate was 0.8 per cent,
the second highest monthly rate last year. It was pushed up by an increase
in food prices (1.2 per cent) and education (1 per cent).
The high December figure ensured the annual rate was appreciably higher than
the government's revised forecast of 7.7 per cent. The government has
forecast an inflation rate of 5 per cent for this year.
Overall, inflation was kept in check by low increases in producer prices,
which rose a modest 5.9 per cent in the year.
Mexico's finance ministry has authorised creation of six more financial
intermediaries, as part of its strategy of opening up the financial sector
to more competition. The new institutions will lend money to small
businesses, provide mortgages, and in some cases pool credit for business
projects within a community.

FT  11 JAN 94 / Washington casts cloud over UN peacekeeping: Edward Mortimer
examines the consequences of diplomatic friction on prospects for peace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In a grim report at the weekend, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN
secretary-general, voiced grave doubts about the organisation's ability to
keep the peace in Somalia after March 31, when US and European troops are
due to pull out.
His proposal for a residual force of 16,000-20,000 soldiers was based, he
said, on what was available, not what was needed.
UN peacekeeping may have passed its peak, after a year of passion and
recrimination in the long on-again off-again romance between the UN and its
most powerful member, the US. Ms Madeleine Albright, US ambassador to the
UN, does not put it in quite these words, but her message in a recent
interview with the FT was clear: from now on the US, in its contribution to
UN military operations, will specialise in activities where the risk of
casualties is low.
Other governments are getting that message, and the UN secretariat is
wondering how many in future will expose their soldiers to risks the US is
not prepared to take.
When then-President George Bush addressed the UN General Assembly in
September 1992, he spelled out concrete ways in which the US would support
Mr Boutros Ghali's Agenda for Peace. For instance, it would train its troops
jointly with those of other countries, and incorporate peacekeeping into US
manuals of military doctrine.
Under President Bill Clinton these promises have yet to be implemented,
although Ms Albright insists they will be. 'My sense is, we're getting
there,' she says, summarising discussions on the subject with high-ranking
US officers. 'Peacekeeping is a growth industry for the military.'
If so, it is an industry with acute growing pains. In Bosnia, the UN
Protection Force (Unprofor) has been largely powerless to protect the
civilian population, let alone halt fighting. The US refused to send troops
of its own unless a peace agreement was first accepted by all three warring
parties.
Instead it advocated helping the Bosnian government with arms deliveries and
air strikes. When Nato, under strong US pressure, agreed to threaten air
strikes if Serb forces continued the 'strangulation' of Sarajevo, Mr Boutros
Ghali said he would expect to be consulted, since air strikes would have to
come within the overall context of the UN operation. This, reported as
asserting a right of veto, provoked a marked cooling in US-UN relations.
Worse was to come. The debacle in Somalia on October 3-4, when 12 US
soldiers were killed and the body of one dragged through the streets of
Mogadishu in full view of television cameras, confirmed the fears of many
Americans that Mr Clinton's 'multilateralism' meant exposing their troops to
unjustified risks, for causes unconnected with US national interests.
Mr Clinton promptly changed tack on Somalia, announcing the March 31
deadline and giving priority to a political settlement between the Somali
factions. He blamed the UN for the previous policy, which was to hunt down
the recalcitrant warlord, General Mohammed Farah Aideed.
This caused intense resentment at the UN: it was done without consultation,
and the hunt for Gen Aideed had been a mainly US enterprise.
Then on October 13 the USS Harlan County, which had been due to land a
contingent of US troops in Haiti as part of a UN operation to restore
deposed President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, pulled out of Haitian territorial
waters, deterred by a crowd chanting that they would turn the operation into
'another Somalia'.
Ms Albright insists that Somalia 'has no connection with Haiti'. The Haiti
operation, she says, was not peacekeeping or peace enforcement: it was a
technical training mission. . . They only had side arms, and were dependent
totally on going into a non-hostile environment.' Yet UN officials remain
bitter about the US's abrupt and unilateral abandonment of a plan which they
had put together under intense US pressure.
As Ms Albright says: 'It's easy for other people to make judgments about our
troops.' What is not easy is for UN headquarters to know whether and when,
in the future, it can count on US troops being available.
A 'presidential decision directive,' setting out criteria by which the US
would decide first whether to vote for new peacekeeping forces and second
whether to contribute its own troops, was the subject of prolonged argument
within the administration last year, and has still not been published. But
already the US has become harder to convince on both counts.
The Security Council has become less willing, in Ms Albright's words, to
'throw a peacekeeping operation' at every problem which crops up - as was
shown in November when it refused a request for a small peacekeeping force
in Burundi.
As for US troops, Ms Albright suggests there should, in future, be a
'division of labour,' with each country doing what it is best at. And what
the US is best at, it seems, is such things as 'logistical support' or 'lift
capability,' rather than frontline peacekeeping duties. Few now imagine that
any US troops will be sent to Bosnia, even if a peace plan is agreed.
Meanwhile, the administration has promised to ask Congress for a
supplemental appropriation of about Dollars 1bn (Pounds 670m) to pay off the
US's arrears of unpaid peacekeeping dues. (This year's bill is likely to
reach Dollars 1.3bn, for which Congress in October voted only Dollars 400m.)
The US is assessed for 25 per cent of the UN's regular budget and 31 per
cent of the cost of peacekeeping operations.
According to Ms Albright, 'fairness dictates that our portion should go down
and the amount owed by nations whose economic power has increased
dramatically over the past two decades should go up' - a reference to Japan
and Germany.
The US is also at odds with Mr Boutros Ghali over attempts to reform the UN
bureaucracy. Not satisfied with having its own nominee, Ms Melissa Wells, as
undersecretary-general in charge of administration, it is now demanding the
creation of a new office of inspector general.
The secretary-general points out that he has already abolished 30 per cent
of top posts in the secretariat, and redeployed hundreds of staff from
headquarters into 'the field'. But, he adds drily, 'when member states have
difficulty in providing their contributions, they have to invent excuses'.
Mr Boutros Ghali is anxious to repair relations with the US, knowing that
without the positive backing of its richest and most powerful member state
the UN can achieve little. But his irritation boiled over when he heard Ms
Albright say, in early November, that 'by the end of this calendar year we
expect to pay more than Dollars 1bn in regular budget and peacekeeping
assessments'. Such figures are meaningless, he says, unless you set them
against the size of the outstanding debt.
Ms Albright is equally irritated by his attitude. 'The secretary-general
overdoes this,' she says. 'We are the biggest payers. . . We are providing
the bulk of everything.' In the wake of November's Nafta vote she is
confident Congress will agree to Mr Clinton's request for a supplementary
contribition. 'But there is nothing people like less than to be badgered,
and Mr Boutros Ghali has a tendency to badger.'

FT  11 JAN 94 / Glimmer of hope for Brazil's street children: Angus Foster
visits a pioneering project to rehabilitate and educate a deprived
generation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Good news rarely reaches Brazil's street children who are forced to survive
amid constant hardship. Last year's murders of children in Rio de Janeiro
highlighted the horrors which occur regularly throughout Brazil.
But a project in the country's third largest city, Salvador, has the initial
markings of success. From modest beginnings the project is now working with
nearly 3,000 of Salvador's estimated 16,000 street children. Most unusually
in Brazil, the private sector has become involved and since August about 250
former street children have been found jobs.
Set up in 1991, Projeto Axe is named after a Yoruba word which means the
positive force or structure underlying life. Following the project's success
it has been praised by Unicef Brazil and the Brazilian government, and is
now starting to advise other cities about their street children.
'Of course we've had many failures, but this shows the authorities that
programmes like this can work,' according to Mr Cesare de Florio la Rocca,
the president and driving force behind the project.
The majority of Salvador's street children, as elsewhere in Brazil, have
families. But they are forced on to the street usually because their parents
cannot or will not feed them.
Most children return home late at night or at weekends and only a small
number have broken ties with their families. On the street, younger children
often rely on begging while older children, between 10 and 15, mix work with
petty theft. Prostitution and drug abuse are common.
In Salvador's busy Praca da Piedade, many children from as young as six
years old are already sniffing glue supplied in return for watches and
wallets which the children pocket from passing pedestrians.
Children wash in the fountain, watch television in a department store and
receive hand outs of clothes and food from a nearby church. 'It is the whole
structure they need to stay on the street, and they have total freedom too,'
according to Lilian, one of Axe's 'street educators.'
Axe has five core activities designed to get children off the street. Since
most of the children are illiterate, one of the first tasks is to persuade
them to return to school. This is a delicate exercise relying on the skills
and patience of the street educators, who often have to persuade reluctant
parents as well.
Under an Axe work education programme, older children work in a recycled
paper factory, metal furniture shop or with clothing design. There is also a
project to teach children music and sports skills.
Children who join the project are given three meals a day, free bus tickets
to their place of education or work, and an allowance of about Dollars 45
(Pounds 30.40) a month. Mr de Florio insists this is not a payment. 'It is
to help them be able to stop needing to work on the street,' he said. Most
of the funding comes from Unicef, the International Labour Organisation, the
European Union and Save the Children.
Axe is unusual because it has attracted private sector help, especially one
of Brazil's largest construction companies, OAS. Mr Carlos Seabra Suarez,
executive vice president, heard about Axe from a Brazilian journalist who
knew the project was having trouble finding jobs for its children.
According to Mr Suarez, involvement with Axe has been positive for the
company and links will be strengthened this year.
By the end of last year OAS had 45 former street children under evaluation,
of which 28 had already been approved for full time work. Most are being
trained for jobs like carpenters, electricians and steelworkers.
A special centre is now being planned where many more children will be able
to gain job training and professional skills. OAS intends to pay the
centre's bills of about Dollars 1m a year, even though many of the children
will be recruited by other, rival companies. 'It is not just for OAS but all
of Bahia state,' Mr Suarez said.
Axe has also placed children with the Salvador municipality, Bahia
university and other employers. One project underway will open a hotel in
the restored centre of Salvador, known as Pelourinho, where former street
children will be trained as hotel staff.
According to Axe employees and outsiders, the project has succeeded for
three main reasons. Probably the most important is its professionalism. All
97 staff are professionally trained and regularly retrained. Several, like
Mr de Florio, have worked with children for many years.
The project also gives a high degree of independence and freedom to the
children. It seeks their agreement rather than trying to force acceptance of
discipline and work. Finally, management is decentralised and does not
impose on the educational sphere.
For the children, it seems to be working. At an end of term Christmas party
for Axe children now back in education, one of them recalled: 'When I
started I was shouting at my teacher. But I think I've learned some things,
thanks be to God'.

The US Supreme Court yesterday rejected an appeal arguing that the White
House should have prepared an environmental assessment of the North American
Free Trade Agreement, Reuter reports from Washington.
The appeal was lodged by the public advocacy group Public Citizen and the
environmental group the Sierra Club. They argued that the US Trade
Representative's Office should have review Nafta's environmental impact.
The Supreme Court denied the appeal without comment or dissent.

FT  11 JAN 94 / Revolt unsettles Mexico market

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mexico's stock market fell sharply yesterday morning as traders saw no sign
of a rapid end to conflict in the southern state of Chiapas. The market was
down nearly 6 per cent at noon, one of the largest morning falls on record.
The Defence Ministry reported late on Sunday that the military base outside
San Cristobal de las Casa had come under renewed attack, and that on Friday
rebels belonging to the Zapatista Army of National Liberation had launched
another offensive against the city of Ococingo.
Notimex, the state-owned news agency, reported two explosions near a
communications tower in Chiapas state on Sunday night, and three that
damaged electricity towers in the state of Mexico. The explosions followed
four bombs in Mexico City at the weekend.
'The market is worried that the conflict in Chiapas may drag on and that it
may not be confined to that state,' said Mr Timothy Heyman, head of Baring
Securities in Mexico City. 'The beginning of a dialogue (between government
and rebels) would be construed as a very positive signal.'
A senior government official said yesterday the administration was open to
all possibilities of dialogue, and would probably make further conciliatory
proposals soon. But he said the army would continue to seal off the area.
'We have to close the circle around them - we cannot permit the rebels to
leave,' he said.
Bishop Samuel Ruiz, the controversial bishop of San Cristobal, accepted a
rebel offer to mediate in talks aimed at ending the uprising. But Ms
Rigoberta Menchu, the Guatemalan Nobel peace prize winner, said she had
rejected a rebel offer to mediate.
The bishop, long critical of government policy in Chiapas, said the
rebellion was an 'historic opportunity' to end centuries of oppression of
indigenous peoples. The Interior Ministry has linked 'religious peoples'
with the uprising, a charge that has infuriated many in the Catholic Church.
The International Commission of Jurists yesterday condemned methods used in
the Chiapas revolt, saying they were 'contrary to national and international
law', Reuter reports from Geneva.
The commission, which groups 45 international jurists, urged an end to the
'fratricidal strife' between the Mexican army and indigenous people in the
state. It also condemned violence by the rebels.

FT  11 JAN 94 / Caracas returns to price control
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   CARACAS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Venezuela has imposed strict price controls on a 'market basket' of basic
items amid mounting public discontent over recent price rises fuelled by the
introduction of a value added tax.
The Caracas government's decision, unveiled on Sunday night, freezes prices
of 11 food items and about 100 medicines. It represents a sharp policy
change for Venezuela, which began to eliminate price controls on goods and
services in 1989.
Previously the country had a long history of price controls and other forms
of govern-ment intervention in the economy.
The price control decree is due to expire on March 1, but businessmen fear a
new government scheduled to take office on February 2 will be tempted to
prolong it.
Mr Jorge Redmond, president of the Venezuelan Industrial Council, which
represents manufacturers, called the government decision 'lamentable' and
'irresponsible,' and said it showed that Venezuelans still felt they had to
run to the government to solve their problems.
The administration of President Ramon Jose Velasquez ordered a two-stage
introduction of VAT, starting last October, with the second stage introduced
on January 1.
Retail prices rose sharply in October and again earlier this month, causing
widespread public discontent in a country which has suffered from more than
two years of political and social instability.
Sharp increases in petrol prices and transport fares in early 1989 sparked
three days of rioting and looting that left about 300 dead.
Some officials are worried that recent price rises could generate fresh
riots.
The VAT was designed to provide the government with a more diversified
income base and avoid fiscal deficits which have fuelled inflation. Big
increases in retail prices since October were caused by a combination of
price gouging by some businessmen and a lack of government information on
the new tax and how it should be applied.

Puerto Rico has launched an effort to protect its tourism industry, the
pillar of the island's economy, from the effects of an oil spill which has
polluted six miles of beaches in the main resort area of San Juan, the
capital, writes Canute James in Kingston.
The local tourism company has launched a publicity offensive and is offering
prospective visitors alternative destinations on the island.
The government of the US possession in the north eastern Caribbean is also
seeking compensation for economic and environmental damage from the owners
of the barge from which the oil started spilling late on Friday.
About half the barge's 1.5m gallons of heavy oil has leaked, polluting
beaches and moving towards an ecologically sensitive lagoon.

FT  11 JAN 94 / Vietnam and US continue thaw
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Vietnam is expected to begin talks with the US on human rights abuses, in
the latest tentative step towards normal relations between the two
countries.
Preliminary talks between the Vietnamese ambassador at the UN in New York
and senior State Department officials could take place this month, and might
help eliminate one more stumbling block to a US decision to lift its
economic embargo on Vietnam.
Eight US military teams are now engaged in a search for the remains of US
servicemen listed as missing in action during the US-Vietnam war, an issue
which remains the biggest obstacle to any US decision to normalise
relations.
But the pace of official visits by US military and political chiefs has
accelerated in recent weeks, and a delegation of senior senators from both
parties this weekend called for the embargo to be lifted.
Although President Bill Clinton announced last year that the US would no
longer oppose loans from the international financial institutions to
Vietnam, and allowed US companies to bid for such projects, US law still
forbids normal commercial operations in Vietnam.

FT  11 JAN 94 / Israel and PLO resume talks
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation formally resumed suspended
peace talks yesterday as Syria, for the first time, welcomed the
Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement as a first step towards Middle East
peace, Julian Ozanne writes.
Palestinian and Israeli negotiators met after three weeks of bickering in
the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Taba to try to end a stalemate over three
main issues blocking implementation of the Palestinian self-rule agreement:
control over borders; the size of the West Bank area of Jericho and security
arrangements for Jewish settlers.
The two sides are also divided on how long it will take to draft a final
protocol, with the PLO saying within three weeks, and Israeli officials
predicting the talks could last up to two months.
Syria, which has been critical of the Israeli-Palestinian peace accord,
yesterday endorsed the agreement.
Diplomats said this was one of many steps being taken by Damascus before a
summit between President Bill Clinton and President Hafez al-Assad in Geneva
on Sunday.

FT  11 JAN 94 / Nigerian budget ends market reform era
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ADAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LAGOS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Nigeria's 1994 budget has abandoned market reforms begun in 1986 and
reintroduced economic controls which critics say have set the clock back
nine years.
A foreign exchange rate fixed at N22 to the dollar, interest rates of 12 to
15 per cent and a ban on free repatriation of export proceeds appear to have
killed any hope of Nigeria reaching agreement with the IMF during the
mission to Lagos later this month.
A deal with the IMF could have opened the way to fresh funds and substantial
relief on servicing Nigeria's Dollars 30bn external debt which is more than
Dollars 6bn in arrears to the Paris Club of sovereign creditors.
The budget leaves a question mark over the future of Mr Kalu I Kalu,
recently appointed finance minister for the second time, who is known to
favour complete deregulation of the economy and an agreement with foreign
official creditors as soon as possible.
Nigeria has not serviced its Paris Club debt for two years, since the last
rescheduling agreement and talks with the IMF and World Bank failed last
year over the government's foreign exchange rate policy, lack of
transparency in oil revenues and heavy subsidies on domestic fuel.
The speech reflects the concerns of manufacturers who claim that they are
being forced out of business by high interest rates and lack of foreign
exchange.
'They have thrown out the baby with the bath water,' said Mr Atedo
Peterside, a merchant banker in Lagos last night. 'We could have had fiscal
discipline and some tariff reforms which would have given manufacturers 90
per cent of what they want without giving up all the gains of deregulation
since 1986.'
Deregulation got a bad name under previous head of state Gen Ibrahim
Babangida, but some of his reforms were welcomed by the private sector. Gen
Sani Abacha's budget is likely to drive much foreign currency trading
underground.
Two months after seizing power Gen Abacha said in his first economic policy
statement that Nigeria would strive to reach accommodation with the foreign
creditors, but seems to offer them little.
He has budgeted for a large state surplus in 1994 of over Dollars 5.5bn
which would allow room to pay external debts but it is not clear how the
government can achieve it. The budget provides for Dollars 11.5bn revenue,
nearly 50 per cent more than in 1993 when the assumed oil price was 35 per
cent higher.
Apart from the introduction of modified value added tax on selected goods
and some higher duty on luxury imports, there is no new source of revenue
and nearly all the government's income derives from oil exports.

FT  11 JAN 94 / India to liberalise insurance market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
India is likely to announce sweeping changes to its tightly-controlled
insurance industry, including moves to end the state's long-standing
monopoly of insurance and open the industry to foreign companies.
Mr Manmohan Singh, finance minister, is expected to outline his plans for
the industry's biggest upheaval since life insurance was nationalised in the
1950s, in his 1994-95 Budget speech, due next month.
Insurance industry reform is seen as an important element in the general
overhaul of India's financial markets, which in turn forms a central part of
the government's economic liberalisation programme.
The basis of the officials' actions will be a report presented last week to
Mr Singh by a government-appointed committee headed by Mr RN Malhotra, a
former governor of the Reserve Bank of India.
Mr Malhotra and his colleagues recommend privatising the two state-owned
giants of the industry, the Life Insurance Corporation and the General
Insurance Corporation, which handles non-life insurance. With their
subsidiaries, the two corporations have virtual monopolies in their markets.
Reflecting India's cautious approach to privatisation, the report recommends
the state should retain 50 per cent stakes in each corporation. To promote
competition, the General Insurance Corporation's four operating subsidiaries
should be made managerially independent.
The report proposes foreign insurers wanting to enter the Indian market
should be encouraged to invest through joint ventures with domestic
partners, rather than on their own. The committee suggests new entrants
should face tough conditions, including a minimum capital requirement of
Rs1bn (Pounds 21m) and a pledge to carry out a fixed minimum amount of
business in rural districts.
Indian industrialists have complained the proposed minimum capital level is
too high and will discourage potential entrants, though it is unlikely to
prove a hurdle to big foreign insurance groups eyeing the Indian market,
notably Sun Life of the UK which has a joint venture with the Life Insurance
Corporation selling insurance to Indians in Britain.
The extent to which the finance ministry will implement the report will
depend on the reaction of the industry's trade unions, concerned
liberalisation could bring job cuts.

Tajikistan plans to introduce rationing in its capital, Dushanbe, to

City council officials said ration tickets had been printed and would be
distributed soon for meat, flour, noodles, butter, vegetable oil, vodka,
soap, rice and tea. Bread is not to be rationed.
The move is part of a general attempt to improve the basic standard of
living in Tajikistan, which remains one of the poorest of the former Soviet
republics, having never recovered from civil war in 1992. It follows the
Central Asian state's adoption of Russia's rouble as its currency last
Saturday, when it dumped the old Soviet-era roubles used for decades.

Damage from bushfires raging across the state of New South Wales could reach
ADollars 100m (Pounds 45.2m) in insurance claims for burned-out homes and
businesses.
The fires, the worst in the state for 50 years, have so far claimed four
lives, burnt out 600,000 hectares of land, destroyed 185 homes and damaged
130 others. More than 20,000 people have been evacuated, including residents
of Sydney's northern and southern outskirts, since last Thursday.
The Insurance Council of Australia said that by Sunday, the damage bill to
houses was ADollars 50m, with another ADollars 50m for damage to commercial
properties. The New South Wales government also faces losses of about
ADollars 50m in forest assets plus Dollars 10m in lost annual royalties.
There have been no estimates on rural properties and livestock.
The authorities do not see an immediate end to the disaster. Rain and cooler
temperatures yesterday provided relief to nearly 10,000 firefighters,
helping to contain the number of fires to 135 from the Saturday peak of 155.
More than 2,000 of the firefighters have come from other states.

<TEXT>
Those with shares in the Kuala Lumpur stock market, south-east Asia's
biggest in terms of market capitalisation, should reconsider their position
very carefully, Mr Daim Zainuddin, former finance minister, confidant of
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and treasurer of Malaysia's dominant
political party.
The Kuala Lumpur market index went up 98 per cent last year. Average daily
turnover has risen from about MDollars 200m (Pounds 51m) a year ago to more
than MDollars 3bn.
'We have reached a dangerous stage,' Mr Daim told the Malaysian government
news agency. 'Almost everybody is getting into the market. Everybody is busy
on the phone. Nobody seems to be working. Everyone talks about shares. This
will affect productivity and lower productivity will affect our economy.'
Mr Daim said the Kuala Lumpur market was due for a big correction after its
recent strong rise. 'The big question now is when. But when the fall comes,
the damage is going to be massive because the market has gone up too steep,
too fast' he said. 'The government will not bail out anybody.'
Not only is Mr Daim a well connected political figure, he is also reputed to
be one Malaysia's richest men who has been behind many of the country's
biggest corporate restructurings - and an avid stock market player.
He said he had already 'cashed out'.

Thai trade union leaders have demanded an 8 per cent rise in the minimum
wage for workers and threatened to call a general strike on May 1, labour
day, if their demands are not met.
Thailand's trade unions are notoriously weak and divided - it is estimated
that less than 5 per cent of the total workforce is unionised  - but
employers are worried by recent successes of industrial workers and unions
in securing wage rises above the inflation rate.
Unskilled labour in Thailand is about five times as expensive as in China,
Vietnam and Indonesia, and some investors are moving labour-intensive
operations in textiles and shoe-manufacturing from Thailand to those
countries.
Many Thai employers and small foreign companies pay their employees less
than the legal minimum, but multi-national corporations with reputations to
protect usually abide by the law.
A group of five trade unions has agreed to demand a 10 baht (26p) increase
in the minimum daily wage, which would raise the pay of a worker in Bangkok
or the surrounding area to 135 baht from 125 baht; minimum wages in other
regions are slightly lower.
They say they have based their demand on the growth rate of the country's
economy; this is running at about 8 per cent a year, while inflation has
fallen to 3.5 per cent.
The 10 baht claim is regarded in Thailand as a moderate opening bid by the
standards of previous negotiations. 'I think this is a bargaining
statement,' said Mr Chalongphob Sussangkarn, human resources director at the
independent Thailand Development Research Institute. 'This year their demand
seems to be more moderate.'
Thai trade unions, which suffered under a succession of military regimes,
are able to operate more freely under the present democratically-elected
government; the ruling coalition is in the process of rescinding a ban on
trade unions in state enterprises.
Union power, however, is undermined by Thailand's reserve of poor, rural job
seekers who migrate to the cities, whereas Malaysia and Singapore are short
of workers.

FT  11 JAN 94 / Golan pioneers refuse to surrender a life's work: Julian
Ozanne reviews local obstacles to a settlement over the strategic heights
bordering Syria
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ramona Bar-Lev settled in the Golan Heights in 1969, two years after Israel
captured the strategic plateau in a counter-offensive against a Syrian
attack.
'We are not climbing down from the Golan,' she says. 'The government can't
talk about the Golan as if it was still 1967. It is now 1994 and we have
given all our life to this place. We are the reality today.'
The views of the 13,000 Israeli settlers on the Israeli-occupied Golan
Heights are unlikely to be given much weight when President Bill Clinton
meets President Hafez al-Assad of Syria in Geneva on Sunday. The two leaders
will discuss making progress in peace talks between Israel and Syria which
focus on an Israeli return of the Golan in exchange for peace with Syria
including trade and diplomatic ties and security guarantees.
In Israel, however, the plight of the Golan settlers - praised and financed
by successive Israeli governments - has ignited widespread public support
and sympathy. Across Israel banners and stickers express public solidarity
with the settlers. Sacrificing the settlers in the interests of peace will
not be easy for a democratic government with a thin majority and mounting
opposition to the peace process.
Furthermore, if Israel is about to give up Golan for peace with Syria, the
Jewish settlers and investors do not resemble a population about to be
displaced. They are busy expanding their businesses and building new
red-tiled roofed homes with government approval and subsidies.
Many Golan residents simply refuse to accept the government would surrender
the sparsely populated Golan Heights which is viewed as vital for Israel's
security and water supply.
Last week Mr Binyamin Ben-Eliezer, Israel's housing minister, officially
opened a government-built 700-house extension of Katzrin, the main Golan
town, and vowed Israel would 'not abandon the residents of the Golan
Heights'.
'The government says one thing but keeps encouraging us to stay here. There
will be no change because the government does not believe in giving up the
Golan and knows it can have peace with Syria without doing so,' said Mr Uri
Meir of the Golan Development Company which encourages new investment.
'I have grandchildren born on the Golan and I have spent the last 26 years
working to make the Golan something special. I cannot believe I will ever
leave the Golan and start a new life at 46 years-old.'
Mr Meir says the Golan contributes Dollars 200m to the Israeli economy
annually from agriculture, industry and tourism. This year a chocolate
factory and a producer of door frames will join more than a dozen other
businesses at the Katzrin industrial site. All investors receive a 30 per
cent grant from the government.
The Golan Heights Winery, one of the existing investors has just started a
Dollars 5m three-year expansion programme, adding to its investment of
Dollars 15m since 1983. The expansion plan will double production to 340,000
cases by 1999, much of it for export to the US and Europe.
'The government is supporting this expansion because it believes in the
long-term profitability of our company,' said Mr Doron Rand, the marketing
manager. 'The government talks about changes but there are many ways to make
changes without us going down from the Golan. On a business level we are
going ahead as if nothing will change. Our future is here.'
The confidence of investors and settlers on the Golan reflects the special
importance attached to the Heights by Israel. Since 1967, the Golan, which
is strategically positioned above Israel's northern valleys, has been seen
as the country's most vital defence line. Unlike the other occupied Arab
lands, Israel annexed the Heights in 1981. Control also ensures the security
of the basin of the Sea of Galilee which supplies 30 per cent of Israel's
water resources.
Golan residents say they are different from settlers in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip where there is a Palestinian population dispossessed of its land.
Before 1967 the Golan was a military area with only a handful of Arab
villages. 'The Golan today is the ultimate model of pioneer-Zionist
accomplishment,' says a campaign leaflet.
Mrs Leora Dormann, a teacher, moved to the Heights in 1981 and lived with
her husband and two children in a caravan. 'The politicians told us we were
the pioneers of the 1980s. We were idealistic and we believed we were doing
something for the country making it safer and building something from
scratch,' she said.
'Many of our friends died defending the Golan. We are going to object,
protest and fight against it and we are not going to go peacefully or easily
and I am going to fight with my kids and my pupils. We are not fanatics but
it hurts. It is as if the government is now saying we have to throw away our
lives - all that we did here.'
Not all the Golan settlers are as determined. Some are ready to leave but
are waiting for the government to offer compensation. 'When people heard
about the Clinton-Assad meeting here they said we are getting closer,' said
Mrs Sue Korda, a resident of Kibbutz Ein Zivan, close to the Syrian border.
But those who want to stay outnumber those who want to leave and, buoyed by
recent opinion polls of Israeli support for keeping the Golan, they are
ready to fight a fierce campaign to stay put.

FT  11 JAN 94 / Japan signals China policy shift
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Japanese government has signalled an important shift in China policy by
indicating that it will be more frank in future discussions on issues such
as human rights and China's growing military budget.
Mr Tsutomu Hata, the foreign minister, told Chinese leaders that the two
countries should be increasingly direct in discussing sensitive issues, a
departure from the traditionally cautious Japanese approach to China.
The Hata visit to Beijing confirmed Chinese officials' concerns that Japan's
new coalition government would take a tougher line than past Liberal
Democratic party governments, in part, because Mr Hata and Prime Minister
Morihiro Hosokawa have strong personal opinions on issues such as human
rights.
Mr Hata told his hosts that China has to provide a clearer explanation of
the intentions behind a 15 per cent increase in defence spending in fiscal
1993. He also asked China to abide by international guidelines on the
transfer of missile technology.
Chinese officials are accustomed to hearing such advice from the US, but it
is unusual coming from Japan. However, the Japanese government sees the more
direct approach as a sign that ties between the two countries are
'maturing', meaning that both sides should be able to speak more freely.
Mr Qian Qichen, China's foreign minister, said his government will attempt
to increase the confidence of neighbouring countries in China's peaceful
intentions. China, he said, is 'actively involved in global efforts to ban
nuclear bomb experiments'.
The military issue was also raised in a meeting with Chinese President Jiang
Zemin who said defence spending has 'not increased by much', and the
expansion of the budget reflects the effects of inflation in China. But he
also insisted that 'we need to modernise some weapons'.
Meanwhile, Chinese leaders expressed concern at what they saw as an
improvement in relations between Tokyo and Taiwan, which China regards as
off-limits to official foreign delegations that give the impression the
island is an independent nation.
The Chinese comments were apparently inspired by a report that Mr Hiroshi
Kumagai, minister of international trade and industry, was planning to visit
Taiwan, a report which has been denied by the Japanese government.
However, Mr Hata stood his ground by suggesting that 'for the development of
China and the development of Asia, we cannot deny the development of
Taiwan'.
He also asked Chinese leaders to use their influence with North Korea to
guide that country away from its suspected development of nuclear weapons.
Mr Hata said Japan would assist China in its campaign for readmission to the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
He discussed the possibility of a new package of low-interest loans to China
after 1995, and Japanese officials indicated that the loan negotiations
could be used to encourage China to be more open about its military
development.

FT  11 JAN 94 / Franc zone 'on verge of devaluing'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The 14 west and central African members of the 'franc zone' were yesterday
reported to be on the verge of devaluing their joint currency against the
French franc, in a move urged by the International Monetary Fund to boost
their exports.
French press say possible devaluation of the so-called CFA franc, set at 50
to one French franc since 1948, topped the agenda at yesterday's meeting in
Dakar, attended by 10 African presidents, three prime ministers and one
finance minister, plus the French aid minister and Mr Michel Camdessus, IMF
managing director.
A devaluation has been made inevitable by the fact that the Balladur
government last year made future budgetary aid to French-speaking African
countries dependent on their agreement to structural adjustments with the
IMF, and that the IMF, like the World Bank, regards the lack of change in
the CFA parity over the past 45 years as a brake on that adjustment.
The Dakar summit is due to agree a FFr360m (Pounds 41.3m) recapitalisation
of Air Afrique, jointly owned by 11 French-speaking African countries.
France is ready to contribute almost two-thirds of this in special advances,
provided the 11 shareholder governments put in some new money and renominate
Mr Yves Roland-Billecart, who became airline president in 1989 and kept it
out of the red until last year.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Hong Kong government is to ask local lawmakers to approve an extra
HKDollars 1.7bn (Pounds 148m) to sustain the colony's airport project in the
absence of a comprehensive financial agreement with China.
The money is needed to push ahead with building necessary works for the
airport on Chek Lap Kok, an island off the northern shore of Lantau.
Officials indicated yesterday they will ask the Legislative Council's
finance committee to approve the awarding of contracts worth HKDollars
1.29bn to build the airport's foundations, baggage handling facilities and
an underground 'people mover'. The government is also seeking an additional
HKDollars 377m for head office expenses for the Provisional Airport
Authority.
Talks between Britain and China about the airport are stalled. The decision
last month by Governor Chris Patten to push ahead with his democracy
legislation without Beijing's agreement has given the Chinese added cause
for delay.
A suggestion made by Britain last week for more talks received no response
from Beijing.

FT  11 JAN 94 / Nato Summit: US revives Bosnia air strikes threat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
US President Bill Clinton warned European allies yesterday that the North
Atlantic Treaty Organisation must be ready to carry out threats of military
action in Bosnia or risk the credibility of the alliance.
'If the situation does not improve, the alliance must be prepared to act,'
he said on the opening day of the Nato summit. However, he later made clear
there was no question of an immediate decision to launch air strikes.
He told other Nato leaders that threats of action 'cannot be seen as mere
rhetoric'. Those who attacked the Bosnian capital Sarajevo must understand
that Nato was serious, he said.
Arguments over Bosnia threatened to undermine the image of renewed purpose
which Nato sought to project at the summit, primarily through the forging of
new links with former enemies in central and eastern Europe. At a press
conference, Mr Clinton said Nato's opening to the east, less than three
years after the disbandment of the Warsaw pact, was the real issue of the
day.
The 16 leaders yesterday launched their Partnership for Peace project
inviting former Warsaw pact countries, including Russia and the rest of the
former Soviet Union, to negotiate military ties.
The plan is a compromise which holds out the prospect of eventual membership
for some former communist countries while acknowledging the opposition of
Russian hardliners who fear encirclement by Nato. The alliance hopes eastern
European partners will join in task forces for regional conflicts. The
summit is also due to approve a new command structure designed to help Nato
deal more effectively with crises such as Bosnia.
Last night allied leaders met for in-depth discussions on Bosnia and
possible use of air-strikes to halt the fighting between Serbs, Croats and
Moslems and ensure that United Nations troops carry out relief missions. But
even before the evening talks, divisions resurfaced among allies. Canada
expressed reservations about the risks of military action, including
possible reprisals against their troops serving with the UN. Mr Andre
Ouellet, Canadian foreign minister, told reporters: 'An air strike might
solve a minor circumstantial problem but could create a number of other
difficulties and make our troops be perceived as belligerents.'
Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign minister, warned that any action would have to
be considered carefully but said the threat of air strikes - which was first
made last year - 'might well be implemented'.
Late last night, in what appeared to be a shift in the UK stance, Reuters
news agency said Britain was in favour of threatening Serbian forces with
limited air strikes unless the airport in Tuzla, north-east Bosnia, was
reopened for aid deliveries and the road to Srebrenica, a Moslem enclave,
was freed for UN troops. France was also reported to be in favour.
Laura Silber adds from Belgrade: Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb
leader, yesterday reacted angrily to Nato warnings of air strikes against
Serb targets ringing Sarajevo, warning that any such decision would
jeopardise talks on Bosnia's partition due to be held later this month.

FT  11 JAN 94 / Nato Summit: Nato's unequal Partnership for Peace - The US
idea for a bigger alliance fails fully to satisfy the former east bloc
states
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Even before it was launched at the Nato summit yesterday, the alliance's
Partnership for Peace plan had lost some shine.
The plan, a US inspiration, was conceived three months ago as a means of
placating both the central European countries seeking Nato membership and
the Russians, worried about being left out in the cold.
Publicising the idea at such an early stage may have been a tactical error,
some officials at Nato now believe. It became clear that the plan would
fully satisfy none of the main countries at which it was directed - neither
central European nations such as Poland, because it gives them no explicit
security guarantees, nor the Russians, since it is billed as a prelude to
the expansion of Nato closer to their own borders.
Invitations to negotiate individual Partnership for Peace agreements are
being sent to all the former Warsaw pact countries, including Russia and
other Soviet successor states in Europe and central Asia. Other European
countries - neutral and non-aligned - may also seek to participate.
Altogether the plan could involve Nato in military co-operation with 30 or
more countries.
First discussed at an informal meeting of allied defence ministers in the
German Baltic town of Travemunde in October, the idea provided an elegant
way of resolving, or at least postponing, a Nato dilemma. Alternatives under
discussion at the time included the creation of some kind of Nato affiliate
status. Partnership for Peace offered the advantages both of avoiding any
new legal arrangement - Nato's treaty makes no provision for associate
membership - and of appearing to be even-handed with respect to Moscow and
its former military satellites.
Nato officials have in the meantime worked hard to inject practical content
into the proposed agreements. The alliance is eager to stage the first joint
field exercises in peacekeeping this year. A 'planning cell' will be set up
at Mons in Belgium, site of Nato's European military headquarters.
Although participants are warned that co-operation will not be a military
aid programme, Nato expects to have to stump up initial funds. These will
not be huge in relation to allied defence spending - Nato sources suggested
yesterday that 'we can do significant things for less than Dollars 10m
(Pounds 6.7m) in the initial phase'. But the plan will nonetheless require
extra contributions to Nato funds.
The plan is being launched separately from co-operation programmes under the
22-nation North Atlantic Co-operation Council, which was set up two years
ago as a forum for Nato to deal with its former foes. The NACC, often
criticised for being little more than a talking shop, will continue to be
for the purpose of wider consultations. Under the partnership agreements, or
PFPs, countries will be able to consult individually with Nato if their
security is endangered.
However, allies have resisted formally extending to PFP partners the
provisions of Article 4 of the North Atlantic Treaty providing for automatic
consultation when 'the territorial integrity, political independence or
security of any of the parties is threatened'. This, it was feared, would
have encouraged countries to seek protection under the treaty's following
article, which pledges mutual assistance on the basis that an attack on one
is considered an attack on all. However, Mr Manfred Worner, Nato secretary
general, said in his opening statement yesterday that the alliance's message
to central and eastern European countries was: 'We shall not leave you
alone.' The PFP plan is presented as being non-discriminatory. But in
practice it will result in several different levels of co-operation.
Nato's aim is that it should act as a filter for genuine candidates
eventually to join the alliance. The communique to be issued today will
state that allies 'expect and would welcome Nato expansion that would reach
to democratic states to our east as part of an evolutionary process'. A less
explicit version, simply reaffirming that the alliance remained 'open to the
membership of other European countries', as stated in the North Atlantic
Treaty 45 years ago, was rejected.
US President Bill Clinton said the plan would 'advance a process of
evolution for Nato's formal enlargement'. In a distinct difference of
nuance, Mr John Major, UK prime minister, said yesterday it 'could' lead to
the admission of new members. Mr Major emphasised that countries wanting to
join had 'much work to do'. Departing from previous policy of not naming
names, he hinted strongly that Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary would
have priority. UK officials said that Slovakia, the fourth member of the
so-called Visegrad group, would have 'a different timetable'.

<TEXT>
Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the nationalist whose victory in Russian
parliamentary elections has precipitated a rush of applications among
Russia's neighbours to join Nato, said yesterday that any expansion of the
alliance would lead to World War Three.
'It would be a huge mistake and a tragedy for Nato, Europe and the whole
world if they move to take in our neighbours,' he told reporters. 'This
would mean Nato took the path of preparing for World War Three against
Russia.' His latest statements, the tone of which changes to suit his mood
or domestic audience's requirements, followed earlier attempts to woo
western opinion by declaring his adherence to democracy, peace, and a desire
to meet US President Bill Clinton.
'We will not allow a single foreign division near Russia's borders. Any
military unit which receives orders to move towards Russia will be
exterminated,' said Mr Zhirinovsky. He also predicted yesterday that the
Baltic states, which already have their own fledgling armed forces and are
among those states which want to join Nato, would be reabsorbed by Russia of
their own free will to deal with their economic problems.
Meanwhile, the reformist, pro-western Russia's Choice bloc announced
yesterday that its strategy for dealing with a man it describes as a fascist
threat to mankind was to try to get him prosecuted for warmongering talk.
'Many of the actions and declarations of (Zhirinovsky's) Liberal Democratic
party are clearly covered by articles of the existing criminal code,' said
Mr Yegor Gaidar, the leader of Russia's Choice. 'We have drawn this
informally to the attention of the general prosecutor's office and will do
this formally.'
Meanwhile, a senior western diplomat has warned that Nato will get the worst
of both worlds with its hurried US-inspired response to new applicants. On
the one hand it is promising security guarantees it is not yet in a position
to offer these countries, while on the other, he said, making it more
difficult for reformers in Russia to hold the line against
ultra-nationalists.

The Polish government yesterday grudgingly endorsed President Bill Clinton's
Partnership for Peace proposal, calling it 'an insufficient step in the
right direction'.
President Lech Walesa, who is due to go to Prague for a meeting with the US
leader tomorrow to tell him of Polish disappointment at Nato's failure to
open up more to the central European countries, has been pressing in recent
days for a firm commitment for central European membership of Nato from the
Brussels summit. He has also criticised the plan proposals as not going far
enough to ensure the security of the region.
Mr Walesa suggested yesterday that Nato membership should be offered to
Russia as a way of controlling its nuclear arsenal. 'I do not know why the
world has not asked Russia to put its nuclear weapons and other terrible
weapons at Nato's disposal when they join. Nobody has dared ask such a
question so far.'
Mr Andrzej Olechowski, Polish foreign minister, yesterday put a brave face
on the issue, however, and said after a cabinet meeting attended by the
president that Poland would accept the US proposal 'after we have seen the
details', adding that 'the proposal goes in the right direction.'
'After all,' he continued, 'now we are in the waiting room - before there
wasn't even any talk of Nato membership.' He added that Washington had
publicly stated in the past few days that 'the security of Poland and the
other countries of the region was of material interest to the United
States', which he viewed as the administration's most far-reaching statement
to date on the issue.
Mr Olechowski was speaking in the wake of an announcement that Mr Vladimir
Zhirinovsky, head of the far right Liberal Democratic party, the second
largest fraction in the new Russian parliament, was planning a visit to
Poland. Mr Zhirinovsky's strong showing in the Russian elections has
rekindled Poland's fear of its neighbour. Mr Olechowski warned that should
Mr Zhirinovsky do anything construed as being against Polish interests, he
would be expelled .

FT  11 JAN 94 / Well-treated Dutch reluctant to face healthcare cost:
Insurance reform plans have made little headway over the years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Late last year Dutch television viewers were treated to a stark view of the
choices which may confront the country's much-praised healthcare system.
A studio audience was presented with the medical histories of two patients
seated on stage. The audience then had to decide which case should receive
funding from the healthcare system's finite financial resources.
One programme featured Mrs Carmen de Bruijn, a 29-year-old mother seeking a
breast reduction operation to alleviate back pain. She was pitted against Mr
Kees Brink and his wife Ms Pauline Linthorst, who had elected to be
sterilised during her previous marriage but now wanted to have children.
The studio audience voted 25-to-20 in favour of the Fl 7,100 (Pounds 2,400)
breast reduction operation and against a Fl 4,200 in-vitro-fertilisation
attempt for the childless couple. The series, entitled 'A Matter of Life and
Death', came under fierce criticism. Yet the programme, partially funded by
the ministry of health, met its goal of stimulating public discussion about
the costs of healthcare.
Last week, the Dutch government launched two fresh proposals aimed at making
people more cost-conscious.
Proposed legislation would allow people covered by the national health
system to opt for an 'own-risk deductible' that would lower their monthly
premium charges. Premiums would also fall for any patient not filing claims
in any given year.
Finally, patients would be able to volunteer to pay all their medical bills
and later be reimbursed by the national health system. These options are
already available to people who are privately insured.
At the moment, patients insured under the national health never actually see
a bill, and they therefore have barely any idea of what health care costs,
says the health ministry.
The Netherlands has been confronting the prospects of wide-ranging health
insurance reforms for nearly 10 years, though little has been achieved so
far because of continuing political controversy.
With a national election in May little progress is expected over the next
few months. The momentum for reform also slowed because Mr Hans Simons, the
secretary of state for health and the main proponent of reform, plans to
leave national politics to seek office at the local level.
The Dutch health insurance system has three tiers, but only one level of
care. People earning less than Fl 56,000 a year receive compulsory coverage
from a network of regional, semi-public, non-profit health insurers.
Higher earners are free to take out private health schemes from a range of
competitors. And the government takes care of long-term treatment for the
chronically ill or the mentally handicapped through Exceptional Medical
Expenses Insurance (AWBZ), which is paid out of taxes.
More than 60 per cent of the population is covered by the compulsory scheme,
with nearly 30 per cent covered by private-sector companies.
While there are few complaints about the quality of care in the Netherlands
 -hospitals are well-funded and alternative therapies are often covered by
insurers - the government believes that there should be more competition
between insurers.
It wants to merge the three separate types of financial flows into one
system, so that healthcare choices are more efficient and cost-effective.
'Under the present system, insurers sometimes prefer to see people stay in
residential, nursing-home care because this is paid for by the government.
This is true even when home help would be better and cheaper,' a health
ministry spokesman said.
Debate about the funding of health care began in 1986, when Mr Wisse Dekker,
a former board chairman of the Philips electronics group, was asked to
review the system.
A year later, the Dekker Committee proposed that everyone be covered by one
basic health insurance package, ending the split between public and private
schemes.
More controversially, the proposed basic package would cover only 70-80 per
cent of the existing, all-inclusive package. Although details were never
worked out, people wanting to insure themselves against the cost of
physiotherapy, for example, might have to take out supplementary insurance.
Mr Simons, a Labour politician, rejected some of the measures, urging that
the basic health package should be as comprehensive as possible, avoiding
the need for supplementary coverage.
In contrast to the Dekker plan, which called for half of total insurance
premiums to be linked to individual salaries, Mr Simons wanted 80 per cent
to be determined by earnings, putting a greater burden on the better paid.
In the end, Mr Simons has had only partial success in his attempt to take
the AWBZ fund and turn it into a forerunner of a single form of national
health insurance.
Rehabilitation treatment and medicines have been transferred to the AWBZ,
but more basic coverage - hospitals, general practitioners and specialists -
still remains in the two-tier, public-private system.
As long as this is the case, the Netherlands is far removed from the goal of
creating one 'pot' of healthcare money from the various 'little pots'
characterising the system.

FT  11 JAN 94 / Yeltsin aide fears clash with legislature: Russia's new
parliament convenes for the first time today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Russia's new parliament convenes today amid warnings from President Boris
Yeltsin's aides of the dangers of fierce new confrontation between the
executive and the legislature.
'Unfortunately we have information that some factions, including the
Communists, are planning a new onslaught on the president and government,'
Mr Vyacheslav Kostikov told a press conference.
He appealed to the Communists, however, 'to look at the bloody consequences
of your own heritage when you criticise Russia's democracy and accuse the
president and government of anti-democratic behaviour'.
The warning came amid claims that five of the main Russian parties have
agreed to nominate Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, leader of the ultra-nationalist
Liberal Democratic party, as chairman of the parliament's foreign affairs
committee.
The appointment, in the wake of Mr Zhirinovsky's strong showing in last
month's elections, would send a further ominous message, especially to
Russia's neighbours.
Mr Sergei Shakhrai, the leader of the reformist Russian Party for Unity and
Accord, says in an interview in today's daily newspaper Sevodnya that the
Liberal Democrats, the Communists, the Agrarians, the Women of Russia and
the Democratic party have agreed a slate of candidates. As these parties
command around half the seats in the lower chamber, or state duma, they have
a good chance of success.
Mr Shakhrai has proposed himself as speaker.
Meanwhile, Mr Yeltsin unveiled a long-heralded streamlining of the
government. Although the reorganisation itself appears to be little more
than cosmetic, its announcement has cleared the way for the appointment of a
new cabinet.
The composition of the cabinet will be the first real indicator of the
government's level of commitment to fully-fledged market reforms, following
the strong anti-reform vote in the December 12 elections. It is to be
proposed by Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, and endorsed by Mr
Yeltsin.
Yesterday's restructuring reduced the number of deputy prime ministers from
nine to four. Itar-Tass news agency, quoting a senior government official,
said the two new first deputies were likely to be Mr Oleg Soskovets, a
middle-of-the-road industrialist, and Mr Yegor Gaidar, who launched radical
reforms two years ago.
Itar-Tass also reported that Mr Alexander Zaveriukha, the conservative first
deputy prime minister responsible for agriculture, and Mr Boris Fyodorov,
the radical finance minister, who has vowed to resign from the government if
Mr Victor Gerashchenko is kept on as central bank governor, were being
proposed for the other two deputy prime minister posts.
Three new ministries have been created, some old ministries and government
committees have been abolished or merged, and others have been renamed.
Mr Kostikov also confirmed a presidential decision to spend Dollars 500m on
a new parliament building, despite criticism that it would be a waste of
money when the state has other buildings to choose from and has sharply
reduced spending on the population.
The construction of a new building showed optimism in Russia's prospects for
democracy, he said.

FT  11 JAN 94 / Bosnians and Croatians draw up ceasefire plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Croatian and Bosnian negotiators yesterday drew up plans for a temporary
ceasefire aimed at ending weeks of heavy fighting in central Bosnia.
However, diplomats described a planned ceasefire as 'tentative' and Bosnian
president Alija Izetbegovic said on German television there had been 'no
great result'.
There had also been failure, after two days of talks in Bonn, to resolve the
future status of Mostar in western Hercegovina and agree on a Bosnian
request to give the rump state access to the sea.
Implementation of a ceasefire has still to be worked out but diplomats said
agreement might be enough to secure the future of the Geneva peace talks
which are due to resume later this week.
Bosnian government forces had earlier this month pushed back Croat troops
from around Vitez, central Bosnia in an attempt to gain control of arms
plants.
President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia had warned that he would increase the
number of Croat troops to win back this territory. But diplomats said that
pressure from Germany, France and other western countries might have
persuaded Mr Tudjman to consider a ceasefire.
'We just do not know if either side mean what they say,' said a western
diplomat. 'Croatia might have agreed to this for public relations and
because of the growing international pressure on Tudjman. But we don't know
if the commanders on the ground will stop the fighting.' Despite Croatia's
goal of creating a Greater Croatia, similar to Serbia's aims in Bosnia,
senior Bosnian officials confirmed yesterday they still wanted to forge an
alliance with Croatia.
An alliance between Zagreb and Sarajevo was formed in early 1992, but
Croatian-backed troops in Bosnia continued to gain territory in Hercegovina,
and around Mostar, the regional capital, in an effort eventually to link it
to Croatia proper. But a Bosnian negotiator at the Bonn talks said: 'We must
try and cement a new alliance with Croatia. We will need Croatia once this
war is over for economic, social and political reasons'.

Two days of talks between Bosnian and Croat leaders ended yesterday without
agreement on a ceasefire or territorial settlement, officials at the talks
in Bonn said.
The officials said the talks between Mr Alija Izetbegovic, Bosnia's Moslem
president, Croatian President Franjo Tudjman and mediators Lord Owen and Mr
Thorvald Stoltenberg, co-chairmen of Geneva-based peace conference, had
ended after a full day of difficult meetings.
They said the four would have dinner together last night and leave Bonn this
morning. It was not yet known whether any of the parties would issue a
statement.
Meanwhile, fighting flared again yesterday in central and north-eastern
Bosnia.
Bosnian Croat forces yesterday tried to retake a strategic road,
intersecting the Croat enclave in central Bosnia, according eyewitnesses in
Vitez. They said the mainly Moslem government army cut through a supply
route at the weekend, running between Vitez and Busovaca, two towns on the
route crucial for the Croats to maintain their hold over the enclave.
Major Mike James, a British UN officer in the area, said the Bosnian army
attacked Croat forces at four points in the Vitez pocket. Sarajevo radio
yesterday denied reports that the Bosnian army started the fighting.
Bosnian Croat forces this autumn suffered a string of reverses at the hands
of their Moslem adversaries. If the Bosnian army seizes Vitez, it will
bolster its control over central Bosnia. The town has a weapons factory and
is the headquarters for British UN troops.
Serb forces stepped up attacks around Teocak, northeastern Bosnia, according
to Sarajevo radio. In nearby Bijelina, local inhabitants yesterday
anticipated an upsurge in attempts to force remaining Moslems out of the
Serb-held town on the Bosnian frontier with Serbia.
In Geneva, a United Nations official said the international humanitarian
airlift to Sarajevo, suspended last week after Bosnian Serbs shelled the
city's airport, is to start again today.

FT  11 JAN 94 / Sweden expects faster growth to help rein in budget deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sweden is recovering more rapidly than expected from three years of deep
economic recession, Mrs Anne Wibble, the finance minister, said yesterday as
she presented the right-centre government's last budget before the September
general election.
She said growth in gross national product this year of 2.4 per cent - higher
than previous forecasts of 1.9 per cent - would set the country on a path to
sustained growth for the rest of the decade and would reverse a recent
increase in the budget deficit.
Mrs Wibble said the deficit in the 1994-95 budget year (July-June) would
fall to 11.2 per cent of GNP, or SKr172bn (Pounds 14.1bn), from 14.8 per
cent in the current year. The borrowing requirement would tumble by SKr51bn
to SKr220bn.
But the budget contained only marginal new savings measures in addition to a
five-year SKr81bn programme outlined last year. This prompted criticism that
the looming election had deterred the government from taking stronger action
to curb growing debt. Net public sector debt at 35 per cent of GNP is rising
faster than in other OECD countries, while gross central government debt is
set to reach 95 per cent of GNP in mid-1995.
'The growth in state debt is seriously worrying,' said Mr Magnus Lemmel,
managing director of the Federation of Swedish Industries. 'The budget ought
to have contained further measures to strengthen the government's control of
the economic situation.'
But Mrs Wibble rejected this criticism, saying the five-year savings plan
enacted last autumn contained the necessary measures to stabilise debt in
1998. 'For economic and electoral reasons we advanced a large part of the
budget consolidation plan to autumn 1993. Last year the critics said we were
saving too much.'
She also denied that official growth forecasts were over-optimistic, saying
latest figures for the second and third quarters of 1993 were 'better than I
had dared to guess'.
The budget forecast that exports will rise 10.7 per cent in 1994, thanks to
increased competitiveness, and the country's current account will move
strongly into surplus. But the domestic sector will again be depressed, with
only modest growth in private consumption and a continued fall in public
consumption.
Unemployment will remain a black spot. The jobless total, including those on
training schemes, is expected to rise to 14.4 per cent in 1994 from 12.9 per
cent last year. The government aims to halve unemployment by the end of the
decade, but it acknowledges that the economy will need to grow by 4 per cent
a year between 1996 and 1999 for this to be possible.
Mrs Wibble stressed the importance of Swedish membership of the European
Union, which a sceptical electorate will vote on in a referendum later this
year. 'Membership is central to winning investment and to the development of
the Swedish economy. We must win the referendum,' she said.
Economists expect a further relaxation in short-term interest rates shortly
to bolster growth.

FT  11 JAN 94 / French inflation down to 2.1%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Weak domestic demand and seasonal factors prompted a fall in French consumer
price inflation in December, according to figures released yesterday by
Insee, the national statistics office.
Consumer prices fell by 0.1 per cent compared with November, giving an
annual rate of inflation of 2.1 per cent.
Insee said that a slight fall in the consumer price index was not unusual at
the end of the year and reflected a fall in prices in fruit and vegetables
and in clothing. Additional factors included a reduction in the price of oil
products.
Economists in Paris said that the weakness of inflation also reflected
fragile consumer demand in the face of uncertain economic growth and the
rise in unemployment. Several economists estimate that consumer spending
fell in the final quarter of 1993, after rising strongly, by 0.7 per cent,
in the third quarter.

The west German economy contracted by 1.9 per cent in 1993, the sharpest
drop in gross domestic product since the second world war, according to the
federal statistics office.
GDP for the whole country fell by 1.3 per cent last year, down from a growth
rate of 2.1 per cent in 1992.
The recession in western Germany had an impact on the eastern part of the
country, which accounts for 7 per cent of the economy. Eastern Germany's GDP
rose by 6.3 per cent in 1993, after growing by 7.7 per cent the previous
year.
Officials at the statistics office said the 1993 drop in GDP was 'dramatic'
but it came from 'a very high point' following two years of boom after
reunification in 1990.
The figures support estimates by the government, which revised its forecast
downwards in December and predicted a 2 per cent GDP fall for western
Germany. In October, the economics minister still expected a more modest
drop of 1.5 per cent.
The economics ministry in Bonn yesterday refused to comment as detailed
figures, including fourth-quarter GDP, will only be published officially
today. But government officials said the fourth quarter would continue to
mark the improvement recorded in the previous two quarters. West Germany's
GDP grew by 0.5 per cent in each of the second and third quarters after a
3.4 per cent drop in the first three months of the year.
Mr Gunter Rexrodt, economics minister, recently said Germany could look
forward to growth in 1994 of between 0.5 per cent and 1 per cent. But
pessimism prevails among independent advisers, (the so-called five wise men)
who see zero growth for 1994 due to lagging domestic demand and delayed
investments.
Ifo and DIW, two leading economic institutes, last week called on the
Bundesbank to further lower short-term interest rates to ensure sustainable
growth. Both institutes are warning that the modest improvement in the
economy could be short-lived unless better investment conditions are offered
to enterprises.

<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Talks resumed in Dublin yesterday between the government, employers and
unions on a centralised pay bargaining agreement to cover the next two to
three years.
The government cleared the way for fresh talks, which broke down two months
ago, by agreeing to phase out an unpopular 1 per cent income levy over the
next three budgets. Ireland faced a return to free collective bargaining
when the talks broke down over the levy introduced in last year's budget.
The negotiations are still likely to be difficult, with all sides seeking
significant changes in the two previous tripartite agreements which have
regulated public and private sector pay since 1987.
The Irish Congress of Trade Unions, which represents most organised labour,
is calling for a 'new departure' in economic policy, involving commitments
to greater workforce participation in company management, together with a
'radical tax reform', aimed at job creation.
The country's main employers' organisation, the Irish Business and
Employers' Confederation (IBEC), also wants a reduction in personal tax
rates and employers' contributions to social insurance schemes, 'to improve
the incentive to work'. However, it is also pressing for a pay freeze this
year, arguing that competitiveness is under threat as a result of the
previous centralised pay deals.
'All the evidence suggests that income settlements throughout Europe have
fallen dramatically in the recent past and are continuing to do so. . . . in
contrast, the position in Ireland has been one where significant real pay
increases have been achieved over the last six years,' the IBEC says.
Average industrial earnings in Ireland rose by 5 per cent last year, against
an inflation rate of under 2 per cent, it says.
The government for its part is also seeking a freeze on public sector pay
this year, and plans to introduce work-sharing and voluntary work schemes
for those on unemployment benefit.

FT  11 JAN 94 / British Steel chief says EU pact in danger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Steel warned yesterday that a key part of the European Commission's
plan to restructure the European Union's steel industry could collapse if a
controversial rescue of Klockner-Werke's Bremen mill goes ahead.
In an outspoken interview following last month's Brussels agreement on state
subsidies, Mr Brian Moffat, chairman and chief executive of British Steel,
urged the Commission to speak out against the Bremen rescue and to encourage
mergers in the industry.
Mr Moffat's comments underline the unease among big non-aided steel
producers following last month's agreement - which resolved disputes over
subsidies in Germany, Italy and Spain - and indicate that the subsidy issue
has not been laid to rest.
British Steel and its big French and German counterparts regard the future
of the Bremen mill as a test case for the industry. In November,
Klockner-Werke said it was selling 75 per cent of the mill for a symbolic
DM1 each to four local companies in a consortium led by the city state of
Bremen.
Opponents say the deal amounts to state aid. Mr Moffat said the Commission
should say in advance of being asked formally to approve it that the deal is
not acceptable.
This could clear the way for a rival plan under which companies in Eurofer,
the Brussels-based association of big European producers, would pay DM1bn
(Pounds 300m) for the Bremen cold mill and shut down its hot-rolled mill,
which has capacity of 3m tonnes a year.
Non-aided steel producers have been given until the end of February to come
up with 25m tonnes of capacity cuts to match the 5m of cuts to be made by
subsidised producers under last month's agreements. But Mr Moffat said
producers would not come forward with cuts if others continued to be
'spoon-fed'.
'If the Bremen issue is resolved unsatisfactorily, that would put paid to
the flat products initiative,' he said. Cuts of 6m tonnes are being sought
in hot-rolled coil and 2.5m tonnes in steel plate.
Mr Moffat said in the autumn that British Steel may not take part in the
EU-backed self-help scheme - under which producers remaining in a sector
will pay rivals which leave or reduce their presence.
Yesterday he said British Steel still reserved the right not to pay the
levies involved in the scheme. 'If we think that subsidies are going to be
continued, the answer is no - and we would not be alone.'

A German court said yesterday that IG Farben, a shell company handling the
liquidation of the notorious second world war Nazi chemicals cartel, has no
legal claim to dispossessed assets in eastern Germany, Reuter reports from
Berlin.
The federal administrative court in Berlin confirmed an earlier ruling by a
lower court in Halle.
IG Farben shareholders had hoped to gain millions of marks in windfall
profits from the sale of the company's property in east Germany.
IG Farben, which developed the gas used to kill millions in Nazi death
camps, was broken up afterwards and formed the nucleus of Germany's three
main chemical groups Hoechst, BASF and Bayer.

FT  11 JAN 94 / Stronger growth undermines hopes of early rate cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Prospects for an early cut in UK interest rates appeared to fade yesterday
as a clutch of official statistics added to recent evidence of stronger
economic growth and a survey of business leaders signalled a possible return
of inflationary pressures.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, returns to Britain today from a business
trip to East Asia. Tomorrow he meets Mr Eddie George, the Bank of England
governor, for their first in-depth review of monetary policy since the
Budget.
High on Mr Clarke's agenda will be official figures, published yesterday,
showing housing starts up by 11 per cent in the three months to the end of
November, consumer credit business in the same period at its highest level
for three years, and details of UK trade with the rest of the world in
October showing volume exports growing faster than imports.
Three surveys, published yesterday and this morning, provide more evidence
of economic buoyancy to add to anecdotal reports of strong high street
spending before and after Christmas, and last week's news of rapid growth in
December of M0, the narrow measure of money supply. Trade Indemnity, the
credit insurance group, reported yesterday that the number of UK business
failures in the last quarter of 1993 fell to the lowest level since 1989. A
Gallup survey commissioned and released today by DHL International, the
distribution company, found increased confidence among UK exporters.
Dun &amp; Bradstreet, the business information group, says in a survey published
today that UK businesses are more confident about trading conditions in the
current quarter, with 58 per cent forecasting higher profits and nearly a
third expecting to increase staff.
Moreover, the Dun &amp; Bradstreet poll of 1,938 managing directors in all
regions and sectors of British business found a sharp increase in those
expecting to raise prices this quarter. More than a third of the managers
surveyed between December 5 and 23 said they expected to increase their
selling prices.
D&amp;B said its prices 'optimism index', which is calculated by subtracting the
percentage of respondents forecasting a decrease from those predicting an
increase, increased to 20 for the current quarter from just 2 in the final
quarter of last year.
The price index was at its strongest level since mid-1991. A year ago it
stood at minus 20.
While the apparent buoyancy of the economy has shifted the balance of
opinion since Christmas against an early cut in interest rates, the outcome
of tomorrow's discussions is not certain.
Some senior bank officials fear that an early interest rate cut could fuel
inflationary pressures, while others fear that the tax increases due in
April could stall the recovery. Officials are conscious that the economy is
heading into the unknown in view of the very large tax increases in the
pipeline.
UK financial markets yesterday signalled reduced expectations of a cut in
base rates from the 5.5 per cent level set shortly before the November 30
Budget.
While other share markets rose, London equities dropped slightly, with the
FT-SE 100 index falling 5.4 points to 3,440.6. UK gilt-edged government bond
prices also eased, while the pound was firm.
Expectations of steady interest rates helped lift the Bank of England's
trade weighted sterling index to 82.5 at the close, its highest level since
October 1992.

FT  11 JAN 94 / Ukraine agrees to removal of nuclear missiles: 'Hopeful and
historic' deal to go before Kiev parliament in the spring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN and JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS, MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US, Russia and Ukraine have reached agreement on the removal of all
former Soviet nuclear missiles from Ukrainian territory, President Bill
Clinton announced last night.
The US president will stop briefly in Kiev tomorrow night to talk to
President Leonid Kravchuk, who will then join Mr Clinton and President Boris
Yeltsin in Moscow on Friday to initial the agreement.
An ebullient Mr Clinton described the settlement as 'hopeful and historic'
and, along with the Nato summit's endorsement yesterday of closer
co-operation with former Warsaw Pact nations, as 'two breakthroughs for
peace'. He was speaking in Brussels at the end of the first day of a summit
otherwise overshadowed by the conflict in former Yugoslavia, over which Mr
Clinton warned European allies yesterday that Nato must be ready to carry
out threats of military action or risk the credibility of the alliance.
On the Ukraine missiles deal, the president was confident that Mr Kravchuk
could carry the Ukrainian parliament with him, but this remains a big
stumbling block. Last year the legislature added sufficient conditions and
demands to an earlier agreement to render it unacceptable to the US. Mr
Kravchuk will submit this agreement, together with the Start and Nuclear
non-proliferation treaties already approved, to the new parliament after
elections in March.
The deal, if agreed there, would remove one of the largest sources of
potential instability in the former Soviet Union.
However, in Kiev last night officials urged caution, suggesting that the
final terms of the accord had yet to be determined. Mr Kravchuk has a
history of appearing to agree on key issues with Russia, then revising the
terms of the agreement later. Relations between Ukraine and Russia worsened
last year after an agreement in principle on the handing over to Russia of
the Black Sea Fleet was later repudiated by Mr Kravchuk.
Both Mr Clinton and Mr Warren Christopher, his secretary of state, argued
that Ukraine would benefit from the missiles agreement - not only in the
form of financial payments from the US, but also because its territorial
integrity had now been guaranteed by the US and Russia, its powerful
neighbour.
The agreement enables Mr Clinton to claim a substantial foreign policy
victory in a field - nuclear non-proliferation - to which he has accorded
high priority. Kazakhstan and Belarus, the other two former Soviet republics
with nuclear missiles, have already given them up.
US officials said the 'framework' agreement to deactivate nearly 1,800
warheads and 175 intercontinental ballistic missiles now based in Ukraine -
all aimed at the US - could see the first transfers of warheads to Russia
begin in the spring. The process is expected to take seven years.
Ukraine will receive 'somewhat more' than the Dollars 175m (Pounds 118m)
already on offer from the Nunn-Lugar programme which helps states dismantle
their nuclear capabilities.
Additionally the US will buy enriched uranium extracted from the missiles
under the existing Dollars 12bn, 20-year understanding with Russia. It will
then be reprocessed and resold on a commercial basis.

FT  11 JAN 94 / Tory MPs attack PM over 'back to basics'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major's handling of the back to basics controversy was under fire
yesterday as the issue of the private lives of Conservative MPs threw the
government into deeper disarray.
MPs on all sides of the Tory party said the prime minister had mishandled
the backlash which forced Mr Tim Yeo to resign as an environment minister
over an affair which produced an illegitimate daughter.
The government's difficulties were compounded by the resignation of Lord
Caithness, a senior government spokesman in the Lords, following the
apparent suicide of his wife. A post-mortem confirmed that Lady Caithness
died from a single gunshot wound to the head.
Mr John Patten, the education secretary, admitted in a radio interview that
the government had been battered by the events of the past week. 'I cannot
remember a time since I have been in the House when it has been so
difficult,' he added.
MPs were split over whether Mr Major should have stood by Mr Yeo to
demonstrate his tolerance, or fired him to demonstrate the government's
commitment to family values. There was widespread agreement that his
decision to do neither has deprived the back to basics initiative of a clear
moral framework.
One influential rightwing back bencher said the government appeared to have
been caught trying to 'duck and weave and fudge issues' instead of offering
decisive moral leadership.
One cabinet minister applauded the prime minister's stand against a 'witch
hunt' for moral nonconformists, but accused him of failing to make clear
judgments about the values involved in back to basics.
The confusion was also reflected in ministerial statements intended to
support Mr Major's weekend assertion that the initiative was mainly
concerned with education and crime. Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, said
the campaign 'does not involve hectoring. It does not involve those matters
which are more the responsibility of the pulpit than politicians'.
But Mr Patten said the government should stand by its commitment to 'family
responsibility'.

FT  11 JAN 94 / Resignation blow to City watchdog
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The creation of a Personal Investment Authority, the planned City watchdog,
suffered a fresh setback yesterday when one of its directors resigned in
protest at the composition of the board.
The move by Mr Jim Stretton, deputy managing director of Standard Life, was
backed by his company, which became the third leading life office to oppose
publicly the plans for the authority.
The setting up of the PIA, a self-regulatory body for retail financial
services, has met a series of obstacles. The damage from yesterday's events
is more serious because the PIA had previously been gaining momentum amid
growing recognition in the financial services industry that the authority
would come into effect around the middle of this year.
Its creation is central to the plans set out by Mr Andrew Large, the
chairman of the Securities and Investments Board, for enhancing investor
protection.
Mr Stretton said his resignation arose from the board's decision that only
nine of the 19 directors should be active industry practitioners.
The board decided just before Christmas that the other directors should
comprise nine public interest directors and the authority's chief executive.
Mr Joe Palmer, the PIA chairman, regretted Mr Stretton's decision and paid
tribute to his contribution to PIA's development over the past year.
Privately, another board member described Mr Stretton's departure as 'a
major blow'.
Mr Stretton argued that since the industry would be in a minority on the
board, the organisation could not be a self-regulatory body, and that the
preferable route would be to move to statutory regulation.
Mr Roy Nicolson, chief executive of Scottish Amicable, has expressed similar
concerns.
Mr Mick Newmarch, chief executive of Prudential, the UK's largest life
office, has already made clear his preference for statutory regulation and
yesterday said he was interested to see the conclusions 'people we regard as
sensible' had reached.
The SIB, the City's chief regulator, is expected to receive a document next
month on the PIA's plans, and other life offices may wait until that has
been published before making their views known. If they intervene in similar
terms, then the prospect of a confrontation between the industry and the
regulator will intensify.

FT  11 JAN 94 / Reynolds reassures N Ireland nationalists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Albert Reynolds yesterday promised Northern Ireland's nationalist
community there would be no return 'to the bad old days' of unionist
domination under the UK-Irish peace initiative.
In his first substantial speech of the new year on the initiative, the Irish
prime minister insisted that majority consent in Northern Ireland was
essential for any peace settlement.
But in a passage aimed at Sinn Fein leaders - who have deman-ded
clarification of last month's Downing Street declaration be-fore passing
judgment on it - Mr Reynolds made it clear he thought the scope of the
so-called 'unionist veto' was limited.
'It is important to note that the requirement for the consent of a majority
is related . . . to the constitutional issue,' he said. 'It does not mean
that all forms of political progress or other decisions by the two
governments are subject to a similar block.'
Sinn Fein has argued that the veto has been able to block political progress
in the past and would continue to do so under the terms of the peace
initiative.
Mr Reynolds' remarks came as Lord Callaghan, the former Labour prime
minister, added his voice to calls for London to provide Sinn Fein with the
clarification it has requested.
But Lord Callaghan - who, as home secretary, sent the first British troops
into Northern Ireland in 1969 - said the government was right not to
negotiate with the IRA alone.
Separately, Mr James Molyneaux, the Ulster Unionist leader, predicted that
talks between Mr Michael Ancram, the Northern Ireland minister, and the
province's four constitutional parties could lead to an elected assembly for
Ulster by the end of the year.
As unionist politicians hardened their rhetoric, Mr Molyneaux predicted that
the IRA and Sinn Fein would reject the joint declaration and said Mr John
Major, the prime minister, was right not to offer clarification. The
document was set out in plain English.
He could see no reason why even those of 'limited intelligence' could not
understand it.
A joint Army and police base at Crossmaglen, South Armagh, was rocked by an
explosion early today. Two soldiers were believed to have been injured in
the attack. A separate mortar bomb exploded at the base last night, but no
injuries were reported.

FT  10 JAN 94 / (CORRECTED) International Company News: When the hedging had
to stop - Metallgesellschaft lost DM800m on oil contracts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Correction (published 10th February 1994) appended to this article.
Metallgesellschaft, the stricken German metals and oil trading group, puts
its losses from oil derivatives for the year ended September at about DM800m
(Dollars 470m). By the time it has shed all its unprofitable positions, a
further DM1.5bn could be added, creating the most spectacular losses
incurred through trading in the derivatives markets.
Could this disaster really have its origins in a misguided hedging strategy
intended to reduce the group's potential losses from movements in the oil
price?
The answer, according to people close to the group and traders in the oil
derivatives markets with a close knowledge of its activities, is yes.
However, as the losses began to mount through last autumn, further
misjudgments by the group's management in the US added to the scale of the
disaster.
At the heart of the company's difficulties lies a basic mismatch in the
maturity of its commitments to deliver oil and oil products, and the
derivative financial instruments used to hedge those commitments.
MG Corp, the US arm of the group, had been bent on an aggressive expansion
of its energy business, both in gas and oil.
Through its 40 per cent stake in Castle Energy, a Pennsylvania refining and
marketing company, MG had been widening its refining interests rapidly. Last
year, Castle acquired Powerine, a California-based refinery. Its refining
capacity is put by analysts at between 100,000 and 150,000 barrels a day.
The group is also reported to have had an ambitious marketing arm, buying
and selling on energy products to a wide range of customers. Total sales are
put at some 300,000 b/d.
Yet the rapid growth of its refining and marketing operations left MG with a
large risk. It was contracting to sell oil and oil products in the future at
a fixed price which had been determined at the outset. However, it would
have to buy oil to meet these commitments at the prevailing market price. If
the oil price were to move up, it could face a big loss.
MG chose to hedge this risk mostly by buying short-term futures contracts.
MG's operations on the financial markets were conducted through MG Refining
and Marketing, the same New York-based subsidiary through which the physical
side of the oil business was handled. The bulk of the trading was handled
through the subsidiary's operations in Houston, a centre for much of the
energy trading in the US.
MG had acquired a reputation as a moderately active trader in the
over-the-counter derivative markets, though not one of the biggest. Its
staff enjoyed a good reputation among Houston's small oil trading community,
and it was known for hiring talented people. Last year, for example, it
recruited Mr Kirk Kinnear, a former vice-president of Phibro, the energy
trading arm of Salomon Brothers and a long-time participant in the
derivatives markets, to run its growing swaps business.
But the group's hedging strategy proved a disaster. It appears to have been
based on a belief which was widely held in the oil markets before this
summer: that short-term oil prices would never fall much below long-term
ones.
Ever since an active market in long-term oil derivatives developed in the
late 1980s, traders say, short-term prices have remained higher than
long-term ones (a phenomenon known in the oil market as backwardation,
equivalent to an inverted yield curve in the interest rate markets).
A number of oil traders recall that it was an article of faith in their own
firms that this phenomenon would persist, or that if short-term prices fell
below long-term ones, it would be only marginally. Based on this
presumption, the maturity mismatch in MG's hedging strategy posed few risks.
It could even lead to a small profit if the oil market retained its gentle
backwardation, since the company would profit from short-term trading gains.
The savage oil price fall last autumn revealed the flaw in this approach.
The long-term oil price remained little moved, while the immediate market
price fell some Dollars 5. Suddenly, MG was faced with big losses on its
short-term derivative positions.
A number of questions remain. Why did MG not act earlier to change its
hedging strategy? As the oil price slid, even before the crucial Opec
meeting in November, it was clear that past assumptions about the pattern of
oil prices might be challenged.
Were all its short-term positions in the financial markets the result of
hedging, or was the company also speculating to try to make a profit?
It is clear that MG was running a large position: even with a Dollars 5 a
barrel loss on all its derivative exposure, it would have needed an open
position of 200m barrels in to take a loss of Dollars 1bn. That is
equivalent to nearly two years' business through its refining and marketing
arm, all of it hedged in the short-term market.
'That's a pretty big bet,' said one experienced oil trader last week. 'It
certainly raises the question of when hedging turns into speculation.'
CORRECTION
We are happy to make it clear that Mr Kirk Kinnear was not recruited to run
the growing swaps business at MG Corp, as stated on January 10. He joined
the company shortly before the end of its fiscal year, ended September, 1993
as vice-president, crude arbitrage. He was not involved with the company's
trading in the derivatives markets.

FT  10 JAN 94 / (CORRECTED) Toy industry reports 15% market growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Correction (published 11th January 1994) appended to this article.
The UK toy market grew last year by at least 15 per cent to Pounds 1.87bn,
say industry estimates released yesterday at the Harrogate International Toy
Fair.
Video games are now put at 40 per cent of the total, with sales growth more
than trebled in two years and contributing the main driving force in the
total toy market's 78 per cent expansion since 1991.
However, industry leaders now believe sales of video games are slowing as
the market for the hardware they are played on matures - and as parents turn
against the solitary or two-players-only nature of the games. Video games
sales for 1993 are nevertheless expected to top Pounds 750m, compared with
less than Pounds 240m in 1991 but about Pounds 650m in 1992.
'Activity' toys, such as snooker or darts, are second in popularity, with
likely sales of Pounds 244m last year, or 13 per cent of the market. Games
and puzzles came third at Pounds 174m, or 9.3 per cent.
'Board games have come back very rapidly in 1993,' Mr Graham Scott, who
organises the Harrogate fair, said yesterday. 'They lost out for a while,
but video games cannot be played by whole families. Board games can, and
appear to have done well this Christmas.'
Dolls and their accessories continue to hold a strong fourth place with a
near-50 per cent rise in sales over two years.
A rapidly developing segment, however, is 'plush', a cheap synthetic fur
which is enabling the market for teddy bears and other cuddly toys to expand
rapidly. Plush product sales are growing thanks to cheap labour in China,
where high-quality, mass-produced plush from Taiwan or South Korea is being
turned into teddies by the million. Retail prices of plush bears range from
Pounds 1.99 to Pounds 60.
'It means you can now have ranges of bears, with limited editions and a wide
choice of options on size to make them more collectible,' said Mr Les
Vargerson, managing director of Agenta Marketing of Market Harborough, in
Leicestershire.
He is the UK agent for Althans, which although based near Coburg, Germany,
has more than 500 people employed in Hong Kong and China. It is now one of
Europe's leading specialists in Asian-made Pluschtierfabrik bears.
The Harrogate fair, which ends on Wednesday, kicks off 1994's worldwide
toy-industry round of trade shows. It usually attracts about 8,000 potential
buyers, importers and exporters from throughout the world.
Mr Con Conrad of Benjamin Toys, who is chairman of this year's Harrogate
fair, believed Mr Blobby, the UK's 1993 Christmas craze, had peaked because
the uncuddly latex figure could drive few spin-offs.
The ranks of Harrogate's dolls, teddy bears, Tom and Jerry lookalikes - as
well as the scores of company representatives trying to sell educational
toys to retail chain buyers - looked as though they hoped so.

Sales figures for toys quoted in thousands of pounds in one edition of
yesterday's Financial Times should have been expressed in millions of
pounds. The figures quoted in the accompanying graph as unit sales were
sales by value expressed in billions of pounds.

The US bank should enjoy a temporary respite from the furore over its
entanglement with the struggling Spanish bank Banesto when it reports
fourth-quarter results on Thursday. The figures are expected to cap a strong
1993, with market projections putting earnings per share for the year at
Dollars 8.20-Dollars 8.50, compared with Dollars 5.63.
The earnings momentum in the last quarter is likely to have slowed, however.
The question for 1994 is: will a tail-off in trading income lead to a slump
in earnings?

prize - Other companies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Bidders for Italy's second mobile communications network will be working
flat out this week to finalise preliminary proposals before the
pre-qualification deadline on Saturday.
After months of false starts, the initiative to liberalise Italy's cellular
phone market, hitherto monopolised by the state controlled Sip group, and to
set up a new GSM-standard network, is moving ahead in earnest. Italy is one
of Europe's fastest-growing mobile phone markets, with more than 1.1m
subscribers to the existing network.
The four consortia in contention are: Unitel (Fiat, Fininvest, Vodafone);
Omnitel (Olivetti, Swedish Telecom, Bell Atlantic, Cellular Communications,
Lehman Brothers); Pronto Italia (Pacific Telesis and a number of
medium-sized Italian companies); and Etra (Eni group, BellSouth, Millicom,
Premafin). The concession is expected to be awarded by the end of April.

FT  10 JAN 94 / GM sets US profit aims after turnround
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DETROIT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
General Motors of the US, the world's largest vehicle maker, has set the
target of achieving a net profit on its North American automotive
oper-ations in 1994 after three years of heavy losses, Mr Jack Smith, chief
executive, said last night.
GM, which still lags the financial performance of Ford and Chrysler, its
domestic US rivals, had achieved an operating break-even on its North
American automotive operations in 1993 before interest and tax, Mr Smith
said. This represented a turnround of more than Dollars 10bn since 1991 and
of Dollars 4.5bn in 1993 alone, Mr Smith told the Automotive News World
Congress.
Mr Smith, who became chief executive in November 1992 after a boardroom
coup, warned that GM's North American production costs were still high and
that the group's balance sheet was 'still too weak'.
However, GM's Opel/Vauxhall car and light commercial vehicle operations in
Europe had remained 'significantly in the black', said Mr Rick Wagoner, GM
finance director.
GM Europe remained the most profitable volume carmaker in Europe last year,
in contrast to the heavy losses suffered by its leading rivals including
Volkswagen, Ford of Europe, Fiat and Peugeot Citroen. It is understood to
have achieved a profit of Dollars 400m-Dollars 500m in 1993, in spite of a
fall of around 15 per cent in west European new car sales.
Mr Wagoner said that GM Europe had incurred substantial restructuring costs
in 1993 to reduce its workforce and its financial performance should improve
in 1994.
He added that in North America GM had operated at 75-80 per cent of its
capacity but was aiming to reach 100 per cent capacity utilisation by 1996
through continuing plant closures, already announced, and rising output.
Mr Smith said that GM's top short-term priority for the past two years had
been to 'stop the bleeding from its North American automotive operations
through improved product quality, a big reduction of unprofitable sales to
daily rental fleets with greater emphasis on retail sales, reduced costs and
lean manufacturing'.
The biggest cost reductions in the short-term - Dollars 4bn between the end
of 1990 and the end of 1993 - had been achieved in purchasing, where 27
North American purchasing units were consolidated into one.

FT  10 JAN 94 / Scandal strikes at pinnacle of Brazil's national life
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAO PAULO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
As if Brazil did not have enough trouble sorting out its huge economic and
political problems, scandal last week hit the pinnacle of national life when
Rio de Janeiro's football federation fell to pieces.
Three of the city's most famous teams, Flamengo, Fluminense and Botafogo -
names which recall as many past glories as Europe's Liverpool or AC Milan -
quit the Rio federation and announced plans to set up a rival championship.
'It's too late now, we can't go back,' announced Botafogo's president, Mr
Carlos Montenegro.
There had been rumblings of discontent from several club presidents for many
months as allegations of corruption and mismanagement swirled around the Rio
game. But the crisis hit in mid-December when the Rio-based newspaper, O
Globo, published allegations from three referees that the Rio federation was
planning to fix matches in this year's state championship, one of the most
prestigious annual competitions.
According to the referees, who repeated their allegations in hearings this
week, officials from the Rio federation told a meeting of about 70 referees
early in December that some results should be decided 'in line with' the
federation's wishes. They were told of a special 'Rule 18,' even though the
rule book only contains 17 orders, which calls for referees to act in the
federation's interests.
Claiming the Rio championship was no longer credible, the three clubs
announced plans to split. They have now started talking about inviting
leading teams from the states of Minas Gerais and Espirito Santo to start an
'Eastern League'.
All of this has left the Rio federation facing the prospect of farcical
state championships in which only one of its four main teams is still
involved. The federation's leaders are also being investigated by the state
sports body and even the Rio legislature.
Mr Eduardo Viana, federation president, has spent the last week dashing
around Rio trying to avoid the press and has refused any comment. Described
even by his advisers as a 'poor communicator,' he was quoted recently as
saying: 'I hate public opinion. The people could all be shot with
machine-guns for all I care.'
Optimists among Rio's football fans say the current problems could lead to a
long overdue professionalisation of the game, which is rife with cronyism.

FT  10 JAN 94 / French rescuers seek flood victims
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rescue workers yesterday struggled to reach four people feared crushed in
their homes when an avalanche of mud devastated the French Alpine village of
La Salle-en-Beaumont, Reuter reports.
Rescuers using mechanical excavators worked through the night in a desperate
effort to clear away the tons of sodden earth that swept through early on
Saturday.
The mud destroyed eight homes and the village church, about 35 miles south
of Grenoble, and two middle-aged couples were almost certainly buried in
their sleep, officials said.
The landslide, over 600 yards long and 300 yards wide, started when a
rain-swollen canal overflowed in the mountains above the village, pouring
water on to a precipice already soaked by weeks of rain.
One of the men believed killed had been warned by telephone of the mudslide
but decided to stay in his house.
The landslide was the worst incident since relentless rains began in France
last month, causing at least five confirmed deaths, flooding thousands of
acres and forcing thousands to flee their homes.
Surging waters broke through a string of dams in the southern Camargues
region at the mouth of the Rhone on Saturday, threatening the vast region
which was devastated by floods in October.
Access to the southern city of Arles was cut off early on Sunday because of
flood-waters.
President Francois Mitterrand on Saturday toured flooded streets in the
south-western town of Saintes by boat. More than 500 houses in Saintes and
the surrounding region had to be evacuated.

MONDAY 10
Nato tries to redefine itself
Leaders of the 16 Nato countries meet for a two-day summit in Brussels. US
President Bill Clinton, on his first trip to Europe since taking office in
January 1993, will be attending. The US called the meeting - Nato's first
summit since 1991 - to try to inject new life into the alliance.
Proceedings will be dominated by a dilemma over how to handle the
aspirations of central and east European countries that want to join.
Keeping both them and the Russians happy looks impossible.
Middle East peace talks
Middle East peace talks between Israel and the Palestine Liberation
Organisation are due to resume. Negotiations have been stalled over
arrangements for the Israeli handover of Gaza and the Jericho area of the
West Bank, which should have begun on December 13.
Beirut reconstruction
The share offer to capitalise Solidere, the company being created to rebuild
Beirut city centre, closes today. The issue represents 35 per cent of the
founding equity; Dollars 1.17bn worth of shares are being distributed to
property-owners in exchange for title to the land.
Wibble presents her budget
Anne Wibble, (left) Sweden's finance minister, presents her budget for the
1994-95 fiscal year. After three years of deep recession, the economy is set
to show modest growth. But sharply rising debt and a budget deficit of about
15 per cent of GNP have cramped policy options in the battle to reduce
unemployment from 14 per cent.
Burmese opposition
The Karen National Union, the largest group of insurgents still fighting
Burma's military government, is to tell its colleagues in the Democratic
Alliance of Burma that it has decided to pursue separate peace talks. The
move comes in response to mounting pressure from its traditional backer,
Thailand.
Britain's Milk Marketing Board
Britain's Milk Marketing Board meets the government in an effort to win
support for its plans to reshape itself as Milk Marque, a voluntary farmers'
co-operative. The Pounds 3bn milk market in England and Wales is opened to
competition in April. If the government rejects the board's plans, an
investigation of the milk market is likely to begin on Wednesday.
TUESDAY 11
Russia's parliament meets
The newly-elected Russian parliament convenes - in two places. Because the
government has taken over the old parliament building for itself, the State
Duma (lower chamber) will squeeze into a former Comecon skyscraper, and the
Federation Council (upper chamber) will sit in the former Soviet
construction ministry a few miles away.
President Boris Yeltsin is expected to address both chambers separately on
their first day. Election of a parliamentary speaker is an early task,
which, reflecting the fractious nature of parliament, is unlikely to be
easy. The parliament looks set to be dominated by anti-reform forces.
EMI meeting
The European Monetary Institute, the European Union's embryo central bank,
holds its inaugural session in Frankfurt town hall. The Institute was set up
on January 1, when stage two of the EU's progression to a single currency
formally began.
South African reform
The Transitional Executive Council starts meeting in Pretoria for what are
expected to be weekly sessions.
Tunnel ticket prices
Eurotunnel, operator of the Channel Tunnel, announces fares for Le Shuttle,
the car passenger service which will run through the tunnel between
Folkestone and Calais. Tickets go on sale on Wednesday ahead of the tunnel
opening on May 6.
UK politics
The House of Commons returns after its Christmas recess.  The Finance Bill
will be published, with no substantial changes expected from the November
Budget, the first to unify spending and revenue measures. Stephen Dorrell,
the financial secretary to the Treasury, will be the minister mainly
responsible for piloting the Bill through the Commons.
Phones of the future
Al Gore (left), the US vice-president, addresses communications and
entertainment industry executives at a conference on information
superhighways sponsored by University of Southern California, Los Angeles.
He will outline the administration's telecommunications policy into the next
millennium.
FT Survey
West Bengal. After a quarter of a century of decline, the state's industrial
revival seems imminent. In Calcutta, the eastern seaport which is the
natural gateway to emerging Asian nations, there is a strong campaign to
revive some of the region's lost glory as India's prime industrial
heartland.
WEDNESDAY 12
Proposal for allaying angst
The Czech capital Prague is the venue for a meeting between President
Clinton and the leaders of the Visegrad group of four central European
countries, Czech president Vaclav Havel (above), Polish president Lech
Walesa, Hungarian president Arpad Goncz and Slovakian president Vladimir
Meciar. President Clinton will be explaining Nato's plans for closer
military collaboration through so-called 'partnerships for peace' that stop
short of full membership. He will be trying to reassure them that the scheme
will address their security fears.
Clinton then flies on to Russia, where among other things the will try to
assure his hosts that the planned arrangements pose no threat to them.
Italian confidence vote
The Italian parliament is due to debate a motion of no-confidence in the
government of prime minister Carlo Ciampi (left). This will determine both
the date of the dissolution of parliament and that for early elections.
Metallgesellschaft
Deadline for banks to approve a DM3.2bn (Dollars 1.9bn) bail-out for the
German mining, metals and engineering group.
Georgia's president Eduard Shevardnadze
Georgia's president Eduard Shevardnadze is scheduled to start a two-day
official visit to Turkey for talks on regional and international issues.
Shevardnadze is to sign a series of agreements on industry and trade,
tourism, security, customs, prevention of smuggling, drugs smuggling,
culture and sports.
UK economic policy
Chancellor of the exchequer Kenneth Clarke and governor of the Bank of
England Eddie George have first substantial discussion of monetary policy
since last November's Budget. Inevitably, interest rates will feature on the
agenda.
The policy dilemma is whether to cut rates in anticipation of the effect of
April's tax rises on consumer demand, or to wait to see how consumers react.
Recent positive economic indicators has dampened speculation of a cut in the
short term.
UK unemployment
Labour market statistics for December 1993 are expected to show the number
of jobless still falling, but more slowly.  Estimates of the month's decline
vary from 5,000 to 40,000, with the trend fuelled by more hiring rather than
just a slowdown in firing.  Unemployment in November was 2,816,000.
THURSDAY 13
Clinton confers with Yeltsin
President Clinton holds talks in Moscow with Boris Yeltsin, the Russian
president. Signs are that economic reform is taking a back seat.
Russia is being much more assertive abroad, especially in the former Soviet
states. And Mr Clinton will need a lot of balm to soothe Russian suspicions
that Nato is creeping up to its borders.
A bridge too far?
A bridge too far? Swedish prime minister Carl Bildt's four-party coalition
will meet in an attempt to make a long-delayed decision on building a
road-and-rail link to Denmark, the first fixed link between Sweden and the
European mainland.
Stockholm and Copenhagen signed a treaty to build the combined 18km
bridge-tunnel across the Oresund strait in 1990. However, the Dollars 2.8bn
project has been held up by opposition from Sweden's Centre Party. Its
environmental objections are shared by many voters, according to opinion
polls.
Mr Bildt, anxious to avoid a coalition upset, is striving to find a
compromise that will allow the project to go ahead, while keeping the Centre
Party in the government. A frustrated Denmark, meanwhile, is threatening to
sue if Sweden backs out.
Professor Stephen Littlechild due to speak
UK electricity industry regulator, Professor Stephen Littlechild, is due to
speak on power generation and electricity supply at a conference in London's
Langham Hotel. He has to decide soon whether to refer generating companies
National Power and PowerGen to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
Analysts will be studying the speech for clues on his thinking.
Thorp in court
Environmentalists go to the High Court in London to seek judicial review of
the UK government's decision to start up Thorp, the controversial nuclear
waste reprocessing plant in Cumbria. Thorp is due to begin operations on
January 17.
Saleroom
Sotheby's New York offers for sale the collection of the late Peter Jay
Sharp, a New York hotelier and real estate developer. The 77 lots are
expected to bring in some Dollars 15m. They include Old Master paintings,
illustrated books, French furniture, and Renaissance bronzes, including the
figure of a bull below.
FRIDAY 14
US seeks boost in the east
Lloyd Bentsen, US treasury secretary, in Moscow for President Bill Clinton's
summit with Russian President Boris Yeltsin, embarks on a trip to the far
east.
His first stop is Jakarta, Indonesia. He travels on to Thailand and China
before returning to the US on January 23.
Bentsen hopes to strengthen economic relations and improve opportunities for
US goods, investment and financial services.
Environment conference
Ministers from 17 nations, including the US, begin an informal three-day
conference on global issues in Agra, India.
UK national lottery
Peter Davis, director-general of the national lottery, has called for
expressions of interest in applying for the lottery licence by today. The
deadline for applications is February 14.
Golden trends
Gold Fields Mineral Services, producer of the influential annual Gold
Survey, is due to publish its second update on trends in the 1993 gold
market.
WEEKEND 15-16
Clinton and Assad to talk
President Clinton stops off in Minsk, capital of Belarus on Saturday en
route to Geneva. There, he and President Assad of Syria are due to discuss
the Middle East peace process.
Inkatha decision
Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi's Zulu-based Inkatha party will decide at its
congress on Saturday, whether to uphold its boycott of South Africa's first
all-race elections in April.
Japanese reform
If the government's political reform bills fail to get through the upper
house of parliament by Sunday - 60 days after passing in the lower chamber -
the lower house has the right to form a joint committee with the upper house
and enact amended versions. The current session of parliament has been
extended to January 29 in an attempt to get the bills through.

FT  10 JAN 94 / Equity Markets: US investors help ease the indigestion -
London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The reappearance of US buyers at the end of last week rescued London from
what was beginning to look like prolonged post-Christmas indigestion. Friday
afternoon is not usually the best time to take the market's temperature, but
there had been previous indications that the mid-week fall of just over 100
points from the FT-SE closing peak of 3,462 at the end of December was
probably no more than an acceptable bout of profit-taking.
The lead is coming from the FT-SE Mid 250 Index, which gained more than 3
per cent last week, much of it while the FT-SE 100 Index was moving
uncertainly. Institutional fund managers, as well as private investors, are
buying the Mid 250 stocks not just because the potential gains are greater,
but because faith in economic recovery remains solid.
The Mid 250 Index is the entry point for the range of capital goods stocks,
a sector which attracts institutional cash both from home and abroad. The
focus on the futures-related Footsie stocks in the run-up to Christmas may
have cheated the Mid 250 stocks of their share of investor optimism.
The blue chip issues which make up the FT-SE 100 list are still strongly -
perhaps too strongly - influenced by the March contract on the Footsie
future, which is more erratic than in the days when it carried equities to
peaks every day.
The FT-SE 100 stocks have become less reliable on their own account, as fund
managers have shown themselves more selective. Much of last week's recovery
leaned heavily on strength in BP, Shell and the lesser oil stocks, which
will remain dependent on prospects for a fresh attempt by Opec to cut
production and raise crude oil prices.
No Opec move is likely this week, and the absence from the week's company
reporting list of the big store companies offers further respite. The
profits warning from Dixons proved a false alarm for the sector but any true
upswing in the mainline retailers must wait upon profit figures from the
leaders. Shares in Kingfisher, Sears and Marks &amp; Spencer have heavily
underperformed since the market went into orbit at the beginning of
December, and the confidence in recovery in the economy needs underpinning
from these monarchs of the consumer spending jungle.
Banking stocks, stars of the most recent advance in share prices, are poised
to report 1993 results, with TSB expected to lead the way at the end of this
week. But the banking results are unlikely to affect overall views on the
market's direction.
If the US funds still rate the UK market high on their buying lists - and a
number of brokerage houses support that view - then the stock market should
see the effects this week as business returns to full throttle after the
curtailed post-Christmas week. Barring any upsets from the over-the-counter
options arena or from global oil prices, the blue chips are likely to
continue to shake off the profit-takers. But the Footsie may have to run
hard to catch up with the Mid 250 Index.

MILAN
Italian markets are hoping that the date for general elections will be
announced after Wednesday's parliamentary vote of confidence in the
government. The markets became increasingly anxious last week over political
infighting between those wanting an early election in April, and others who
would prefer June to give the weakened centre parties more time to regroup.
STOCKHOLM
Today's Swedish budget is expected to provide the market with some support.
However, continuing political rows over environmental issues involving the
Oresund bridge project could offset otherwise positive expectations. Unibank
says that with the marked strengthening of the krona and the sharp fall in
long-dated interest rates in mind, the scope for a cut in the marginal
lending rate has improved.
FRANKFURT
The German markets look likely to move sideways in the coming week, although
UBS warns that the banks could continue to underperform. UBS adds that
market participants were too optimistic about the impact of fresh liquidity
in January. The market will be vulnerable until overhanging trading
positions, bought in anticipation of a good performance, have been cleared.
PARIS
Inflation figures for December are due today. NatWest Securities says that
another low figure should buttress the franc, reinforcing the ability of the
Bank of France to lower rates once the Bundesbank moves again.
LONDON
FG Inversiones Bursatiles, the influential independent Spanish stockbroker,
will be setting out its thoughts on the outlook for the Madrid market at a
presentation in London tomorrow. Today, Davy Stockbrokers of Dublin is in
London to present its view on prospects for the Irish market.
TOKYO
Shares, which recovered the 18,000-level after foreign buying last week, are
likely to hover around that level as a result of profit-taking ahead of the
March book closing. However, the Nikkei may see steady buying as a further
fall in long-term interest rates could trigger a shift of funds into stocks.

FT  10 JAN 94 / Equity Markets: Cash inflow cheers bulls and bears - New
York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The year-end stand-off between the inflation-wary bears and the
growth-minded bulls began to erode last week under the weight of a seasonal
inflow of funds from institutional investors adjusting their portfolios for
1994.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average pushed above the 3,800 level, an important
barrier, for the first time and rang up a 66-point advance on the week.
The balance may tip more decisively this week. Based on last Friday's
December employment data and expectations of tame consumer and producer
price reports this week, the optimists have every reason to feel vindicated.
However, the next few days may test their patience. The strides taken last
week were in part explained by the so-called January effect. This phenomenon
is caused by the reinvestment of cash generated for tax-related stock sales
at the end of the previous year. With the January surge tampering off,
cyclical stocks may stall.
Given the sharp, speculative rise of cyclical stocks 'investors may have
trouble finding value in the near term', says Mr James Solloway, director of
equity research at Argus Research in New York.
'After the past two weeks, the market has become a little bit extended, a
little too leggy,' agrees Mr Alfred Goldman, technical market analyst at AG
Edwards &amp; Sons of St Louis. 'This week there may be a pause to refresh.'
If so, Mr Solloway would view any pull-back as a buying opportunity. The
overall trend remains bullish, both analysts believe, citing the economic
fundamentals.
Those who see a sustained period of low-inflationary growth on the horizon
were cheered on Friday when the Labor Department reported non-farm payrolls
last month grew by 183,000, well below expectations, but strong enough to
suggest continued economic buoyancy.
The figure reinforces the impression that the economy is expanding on the
back of productivity gains rather than increased labour costs, a trend which
Mr David Hale, chief economist with Kemper Securities in Chicago, expects to
continue through 1994. That bodes well for fat corporate profits as well as
low interest rates - both of which are supporting stock prices.
Cyclical companies are benefiting from strong capital spending by
manufacturers. Equities in general have prospered as investors seek better
returns than money market funds and other short-term instruments are
yielding.
The focus is centred on December's producer price index, due Wednesday, and
the consumer price index scheduled for release the next day. The data will
provide direct evidence of inflationary pressures.
Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette is forecasting a 0.1 per cent PPI decline and a
0.1 per cent rise in the CPI, suggesting prices are well under control. If
those estimates prove accurate, the bond market is likely to rally and 'any
pause to refresh' in equities may turn out to be very brief indeed.

FT  10 JAN 94 / Equity Markets: Gold funds add the glister to a remarkable
year - Risk and Reward
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
1993 was a remarkable year for the world's stock markets, a fact underscored
by the latest performance data on equity mutual funds. According to Lipper
Analytical of New Jersey, gold funds topped the performance charts in 1993
after being laggards for a decade.
Benefiting from a 17.8 per cent rise in the price of gold and a 13 per cent
appreciation of the South African rand against the US dollar, Lipper reports
that gold funds posted an 80.87 per cent average return for the year.
While gold bugs finished first, every category of stock fund that Lipper
tracks finished ahead for the year. Funds which invested heavily in emerging
markets and international stocks were second only to gold.
Mutual funds, the investment vehicle for US investors who prefer to trust
their savings to professional money managers, saw assets balloon in 1993.
Stock funds in particular received an influx of cash, as people moved money
out of low-yielding fixed-income accounts in search of higher returns.
Net sales of mutual fund shares reached a record Dollars 250bn in the first
11 months of the year. However, mutual fund purchases did slow in the fourth
quarter, a cautious response to stock markets that were reaching historic
highs.
Stock funds invested in international markets outperformed general funds,
which have both US domestic and foreign investments, by a factor of three.
Lipper reported an average return of 43 per cent for world equity funds,
compared with an average 12.5 per cent increase in the 1,336 general equity
funds it tracks.
In the US, that compares with a 16.97 per cent gain in the Dow Jones
Industrial Average for the year, or the relatively lacklustre gain of 10.06
per cent in the Standard and Poor's 500 index.
The fever of rallies in emerging markets last year was reflected broadly in
the mutual fund sector. Regionally, shares of Pacific basin funds advanced
63.81 per cent in the year, lifted by a 145 per cent advance in Hong Kong.
Latin American funds, rarely seen until last year, gained in popularity. The
nine funds Lipper tracks posted a 57.05 per cent annual return. Canadian
funds appreciated 34.3 per cent on average. Their robust growth, analysts
said, could be attributed partially to optimism generated by the debate over
and completion of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
Equity funds targeting European markets advanced 26 per cent, overwhelming
the falls in many European currencies against the US dollar. That
performance was below the 50.2 per cent five-year average for the European
funds.
Japanese funds finished last in the international sector, suffering with
Japan's battered stock market, but they still managed a 23 per cent
annualised return. Lipper's editor Mr William McBride explains that an 11
per cent gain in the yen's value in dollar terms, combined with some
first-half market gains, helped offset the effects of the slide in Japan's
market in the second half of the year.
Reflecting on the fact that the current stock and bond market rallies are
one of the longest in living memory, particularly in the US, Lipper advises
caution in 1994 fund selection. For the nervous investor, it favours money
market funds, the mutual fund industry's version of cash.
For stock funds, it advises high-quality growth funds for the least downside
potential, and funds indexed to the S&amp;P 500 for new investors.
For the adventurous, Lipper pinpoints last year's laggards, Japanese and
health/biotechnology sector funds.

FT  10 JAN 94 / World Bond Markets: A flying start in the Eurolira sector -
International
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Borrowers dashed with almost indecent haste to launch their new year
Eurobond issues, tapping a wide variety of currencies and maturities in the
first few days of 1994.
While several sectors of the international bond market saw substantial new
supply, one of the most interesting was the Eurolira sector. This area
offered borrowers attractive arbitrage opportunities, at a time when the
regulations governing the market have been eased and when investor demand
for high-yielding paper is expected to remain quite strong.
Last week saw a sudden rise in Eurolira issuance with seven new issues -
from Eurofima, Kingdom of Sweden, Dresdner Finance, GECC, Credit Local de
France, Bayerische Hypobank, and Abbey National - raising a total of
L1,750bn, or nearly 10 per cent of the total of L18,076bn raised in Eurolira
issues in the whole of 1993.
It not unusual for issuers to kick off the new year with a burst of
activity. But the start of 1994 saw a change in some of the regulations
concerning the Eurolira sector.
Lead managers no longer need to obtain permission from the Bank of Italy for
such issues. Instead, a Bank of Italy official said, they only have to
notify the central bank of their intention to launch a Eurolira issue and
can assume that the deal will automatically go ahead. Only in the case of
borrowers with a low credit rating or no rating at all, or in cases where
the issue has an unusual structure, does the central bank maintain its right
to withhold permission.
From the borrowers' point of view, it is the favourable swap opportunities
which have provided the main driving force, allowing issuers to obtain
attractive sub-Libor funding.
Such opportunities come and go, and borrowers have to be quick to take
advantage of them. For example, syndicate officials point out that for much
of December, swap opportunities were unattractive, and so there was almost
no issuance of Eurolira paper that month.
From the investors' point of view, 1993 was a very good year for both
Italian government bonds and Eurolira bonds, and these markets are expected
to continue to perform well in 1994.
Dealers cite several attractions of Eurolira paper. This sector of the
international bond market is normally dominated by retail investors hunting
for high coupons. Few other areas of the international bond market can
provide such high coupons and such high overall yields.
Coupons on Eurolira paper were in double digits last summer, and while they
have steadily come down since then - last week's issues offered coupons
ranging between 7.375 per cent and 7.875 per cent - they are still
substantially higher than the coupons and overall yields on offer with, say,
D-Mark denominated paper.
Bond market specialists expect Italian government and Eurolira bonds to
rally further in 1994 as inflation continues to decline and interest rates
continue to fall.
While hopes are high of a cut in official interest rates in the near future,
some analysts predict that the Bank of Italy may hold off cutting rates
until the Bundesbank lowers the key German interest rates.
In the secondary market, Eurolira paper is quite expensive, with many issues
trading at well over par, dealers said. Yet in spite of these factors,
investors did not appear to be rushing to buy up all the new Eurolira
issues. By Friday afternoon, some of the issues were only just trading at
full fees, and dealers quoted prices for the Kingdom of Sweden and Credit
Local which were outside full fees.
The more generous in the market attributed this lack of investor interest to
the holiday hangover, adding that it was proving difficult to track down
investors as many are not expected to return to work full-time until today.
Others claimed that the Kingdom of Sweden deal had been priced too
aggressively and that matters had not been helped by the generally heavy
supply.
'The market has had enough, it is getting saturated,' said one dealer.
Given the conditions, it remains to be seen whether the European Investment
Bank goes ahead this week with the launch of its much-rumoured L1,000bn
Eurolira issue.
Such a large deal could well swamp a market which appears to be suffering
from a bout of indigestion.

The US bond market, buoyed on Friday by helpful employment figures for
December, will be looking for good inflation statistics this week to bolster
its positive new tone.
The market rallied strongly on Friday on the release of figures that showed
payrolls rising by 183,000 in December. This was well short of the figures
that Wall Street had been expecting.
The statistics suggested that the US economy grew at a moderate pace in the
month, ameliorating fears that November's fast growth would be sustained, in
turn leading to a higher rate of inflation and early action by the Federal
Reserve to raise interest rates.
The 30-year-issue ended the week with a yield of 6.22 per cent - the lowest
it has been since December 23, and down from 6.41 on Monday, which marked a
4 1/2 -month high.
Analysts expect this positive backdrop to be reinforced by very small
increases in the inflation indices for December.
The producer price index, which is due on Wednesday, is expected to show no
rise in the price of finished goods.
The consumer index, which is due on Thursday, is forecast to show a 0.2 per
cent increase, or 0.3 per cent in the core index, which ignores volatile
food and energy prices.

<TEXT>
Pessimism over economic recovery is expected to deepen as the bond market
concentrates on the negotiations for political reform.
That debate could further delay the economic support package. If the
political reform bill fails to pass the upper house by Sunday - 60 days
after the bill's passage in the lower house - the lower chamber obtains the
right to form a joint committee with the upper house to enact amended
versions.
Expectation of a delay in the economic package is deepening the gloom,
pushing the yield on the No 157 10-year benchmark lower. Some traders expect
the yield, which closed below the 3 per cent mark last Friday for the first
time in six years, to test the historical low of 2.55 per cent.
Last week's recovery of the Tokyo stock market gives little incentive to
place new funds into the bond market. Speculation of lower interest rates
and an imminent cut in the official discount rate cut have been supported by
weak share prices, but further buying of export-oriented shares due to the
weaker yen could undermine such hopes.
Short-term interest rates may rise slightly this week, the final week for
the December reserve maintenance period. Banks are expected to dip into the
money markets to raise funds for their accounts at the Bank of Japan.

Investors appeared to be taking a breather last week, when trading was thin
and prices drifted lower. But they should have some more substantial
domestic economic figures to chew on over the next fortnight. Earnings and
unemployment figures are due this week and December retail sales and
inflation figures are due on January 19.
Traders will be watching for signs of inflationary pressures that might
prevent the government from cutting base rates. 'Earnings growth has fallen
to 3 per cent and it is vital to the bull case for gilts that the rate of
growth does not pick up,' says Mr Simon Briscoe, UK economist at Warburg
Securities.
Long gilts fell about 1 1/2 points between Tuesday and Thursday last week.
The higher-than-expected growth in the M0 narrow money supply measure was
not encouraging. The M0 rise, and an 8.6 per cent annual increase in notes
in circulation for the week to January 5, indicated buoyant spending over
the Christmas/new year period.
However, overseas factors were the main influence for much of the week. The
Bundesbank left rates unchanged on Thursday, and in the early part of the
week investors were fearful that the Fed might tighten US rates. But
Friday's weaker-than-expected US employment numbers helped gilts to rally
along with US Treasuries.

FT  10 JAN 94 / World Bond Markets: Ireland remains an attractive option -
Capital &amp; Credit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While most European bond markets wallowed in the doldrums, Irish gilts
powered ahead last week, fuelled by bullish domestic fundamentals and a cut
in interest rates.
Although the market has enjoyed a sizeable rally in recent months, many feel
it has further to go. 'Ireland is one of the most attractive stories
around,' says Mr Gordon Johns, managing director of Kemper Investment
Management, the London-based fixed-income subsidiary of the large US fund.
According to Kemper's calculations, Irish gilts last year posted the
strongest performance of the 21 bond markets it monitors, yielding a 30.2
per cent total return in local currency terms. While such stellar returns
are less likely this year, 'on fundamental economic grounds, the Irish
market is still very attractive', says Mr Johns.
The Irish Treasury last week surprised the markets with lower-than-expected
1993 budget deficit numbers, announcing that the Exchequer Borrowing
Requirement for last year was IPounds 690m, or 2.5 per cent of gross
national product, well below the target of IPounds 766m, or 2.8 per cent of
GNP.
'The underlying state of public finances was much better than expected, and
Ireland and Luxembourg were the only two countries to meet the Maastricht
criterion on budget deficits last year,' notes Mr Han de Jong, chief
economist at Goodbody Stockbrokers in Dublin. The government's funding
position at the end of 1993 was 'extremely favourable, leaving it in a very
healthy position going into 1994', he adds.
Funding is set to decline this year, with gross issuance seen down sharply
from last year's IPounds 3.5bn. Mr Oliver Mangan, senior economist at Davy
Stockbrokers in Dublin, estimates gross issuance of about IPounds 1.9bn this
year.
While last year's issuance was concentrated mainly in the 5-10 year
maturities, some borrowing is likely to shift to longer maturities next
year. '1994 is likely to see the creation of a new long-dated stock,
possibly a 25- or 30-year issue,' says Mr Mangan.
Meanwhile, the Irish pound has been going from strength to strength,
becoming the firmest currency in the European Monetary System's
exchange-rate grid and trading above its former 2.25 per cent ERM ceiling
against the D-Mark. It traded at around DM2.48 late on Friday, well above
the DM2.4660 upper limit accorded to it under the former narrow-band ERM.
The currency's strength, and last week's decline in money markets rates
following a Christmas squeeze, enabled the central bank to cut its
short-term facility and overnight deposit rates by 25 basis points on
Friday, to 6.75 per cent and 3.50 per cent respectively. The move followed
last week's rate cuts in Austria, Denmark, Belgium and the Netherlands,
though it surprised many observers who had not expected the Irish Central
Bank to cut rates before the Bundesbank's next monetary easing.
The Irish pound is likely to remain underpinned by the country's solid
economic performance. After growing by some 2 per cent in 1993, Ireland's
GNP is set to rise by about 3.5 per cent in 1994, lifted by a recovery in
domestic demand, the acceleration of UK growth and the consolidation of the
US recovery, Mr Mangan predicts. By the end of the year, he expects the
pound to be higher against sterling at Pounds 0.97 and a good deal stronger
against the D-Mark, at around DM2.57.
Inflation is expected to remain under control. Following last January's 10
per cent devaluation of the pound, many forecast a headline inflation rate
around 3 per cent. Instead, it fell to an annual average of about 1.6 per
cent.
In spite of prospects for continued economic recovery next year, inflation
pressures are expected to remain capped by low oil prices, subdued UK
inflation, the strength of the Irish pound, moderate pay increases amid
near-17 per cent unemployment and few, if any, indirect tax increases in the
January budget. Most analysts are looking for an average headline rate of
2.5 per cent to 3 per cent in 1994.
The Irish 10-year yield spread over German bunds narrowed sharply in 1993
after hitting a high of some 300 basis points last January. On Friday, it
stood at some 68 basis points, at the low end of its recent 70-90 basis
point range. However, although yields are expected to continue falling, many
analysts do not expect that gap to get much tighter.
If anything, it could widen back to the top of that range in the second half
of the year, when UK yields are expected to rise in response to a
deterioration in the UK inflation profile. The favourable inflation gap over
Germany is likely to be eroded in the course of this year as inflation
declines in Germany and rises in Ireland, causing the yield gap to widen. By
the year-end, most analysts expect the Irish 10-year yield to be between
5.75-6 per cent, trading at some 80 basis points over bunds.

German government bonds have had a bumpy ride, rallying sharply over the
Christmas period, selling off last Tuesday and recouping some of those
losses towards the end of the week.
The Bundesbank's decision to leave interest rates unchanged at last
Thursday's council meeting, and statements from Mr Hans Tietmeyer, its
president, that rates would be kept on hold for the time being, gave some
support to the long end of the yield curve as well as the D-Mark.
Bunds were further underpinned by the strength of the US Treasuries market
following the release of slightly weaker-than-expected US jobless numbers on
Friday.
In the absence of market-moving data, German bonds this week are expected to
trade within a narrow range, with the March bund future seen fluctuating
roughly between levels of 100.90 and 101.30.
Meanwhile, Bundesbank watchers are eagerly awaiting the release of January
inflation data and M3 money supply numbers, which are expected next week,
for further clues to the pace of monetary easing.
Until then, fixed-rate securities repurchase agreements at 6 per cent for
the next two weeks will keep rate-cut speculation to a bare minimum.

FT  10 JAN 94 / Emerging Markets: News round-up
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hong Kong
China will this week announce another group of Chinese incorporated
companies to be listed in Hong Kong. Charles Lee, chairman of the Hong Kong
stock exchange, said they would be medium to small-sized firms involved in
the infrastructure, transportation and telecommunications businesses.
Lee added that it was possible that one or two of the companies in the group
would seek listings in Europe and in the US as well.
Poland
The Polish government is considering introducing some form of taxation on
capital gains. However, Mr Marek Borowski, the finance minister, said that
the tax should be small so that it did not discourage investors or hamper
the growth of the stock market, which has been a source of income.
Poland has stepped up its efforts to lure more state firms into its landmark
Mass Privatisation Programme before closing the list of participants at the
end of this month. Mr Wieslaw Kaczmarek, the privatisation minister, met
managers and union leaders from 56 state companies in an effort to persuade
them to join 367 firms already enlisted for the programme.
Zimbabwe
Zimbabwe's central bank is to issue details soon about the new rules on
increased foreign shareholdings in local firms. The central bank has already
said that foreign investors would be allowed to buy up to 35 per cent of
shares offered by local companies, with each individual investor limited to
10 per cent of equity offered.
Israel
The chairman of the Tel Aviv stock exchange is cautious about the outlook
for 1994. Mr Haim Stoessel said that future developments depended
increasingly on a mixture of political and economic factors that were not
easily forecast.
Stoessel added that 186 new companies offering their shares in 1993 and the
number of shares traded reached 1,140 from 777 at the end of 1992.

FT  10 JAN 94 / Emerging Markets: Will the boom continue in central Europe?
 -The Emerging Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Central Europe's fledgling stock markets astonished all but a tiny handful
of canny professionals last year as word of large paper profits attracted
local and foreign money into Warsaw's tiny stock exchange.
Warsaw's boom was followed by similar forays into Prague and Budapest as the
price earnings ratios of Polish shares rose to western levels and investors
piled into Hungarian and Czech shares hoping for a similar ride.
Few expect Warsaw, with its puny 22 stocks, to repeat last year's average
700 per cent capital gain. But last year's easy profits have already
attracted the attention of traditional left-wing thinkers among the
re-vamped former communists who dominate the left of centre coalition
government formed after general elections in September.
In parliament last week Mr Leszek Miller, the labour minister, who faces
strong demands from his party's trade union backers for higher pensions and
social spending, called for a capital gains tax and Mr Marek Borowski, the
finance minister, said his ministry was exploring the practicalities of a
small transaction tax on share dealings on the Warsaw bourse.
However, Mr Borowski quickly added that the government as a whole was
convinced that public finances had more to gain from continued growth of the
stock market than from new taxes.
Pointing to the 3,000bn zlotys raised for the state treasury from the recent
privatisation of Bank Slaski he sought to educate the government's own
political supporters by warning that taxes which depressed share prices
would lead to a fall in the expected revenue from privatisation.
Many foreign investors, who moved in when they noticed the market take off
in the first half of 1993, have in any case already taken their profits. Big
players in emerging markets, like Salomon Brothers, expect a substantial
market correction to reduce share prices which no longer bear much relation
to the future earnings capacity of the enterprises concerned.
A correction will be painful for thousands of latecomers to the Warsaw
bourse but is unlikely to be either very deep or prolonged. The Polish
economy expects another year of 4 to 5 per cent growth in 1994.
The new government has indicated it will maintain the tight fiscal and
monetary stance dictated by the IMF, and hopes are rising for an agreement
on Poland's Dollars 13bn (Pounds 8.7bn) commercial bank debt. The latter
would improve Poland's access to future bank borrowing and raise its overall
investment profile.
On the privatisation front some 20 to 30 'National Investment Funds' are
being created to manage more than 360 state companies to be privatised in
the first round of mass privatisation. They will be run by foreign and
Polish-based investment managers.
Throughout the region, 1994 should be the year when privatisation really
takes off. The Czech Republic has emerged as the clear leader in mass
privatisation through its voucher privatisation scheme with shares in more
than 1,300 companies distributed between 8m voucher holders.
Most deposited their vouchers with a dozen investment funds to manage. This
has left the funds free to become the main buyers and sellers of shares, on
and off the stock exchange, building up controlling stakes in chosen
companies as they do so. A second round of privatisation, involving more
than 600 companies, has started.
Czech fund managers are already seeking qualified managers for their new
assets, in one emblematic case recruiting a former vice chairman of Chrysler
to restore the fortunes of Tatra, the Czech heavy truck maker.
This year, given the high cost and difficulty of obtaining finance from the
banking system, many companies in central Europe will be tempted to take
advantage of booming stock markets to seek a stock market quotation and make
public share offers to raise cheap equity capital. At this point the stock
markets will cease to be the glorified casinos they have been up to now and
start to perform their basic economic function - providing a channel for
capital from investors to enterprises. In many cases initial public
offerings from newly privatised companies are expected to provide a
relatively cheap entry for investors.
On the Prague stock exchange, officially opened last April, trading only
really began in June after shares from the first wave of voucher
privatisation were finally transferred to their new owners. By December 16,
the last session of 1993, securities worth more than Kcs9bn (Dollars 310m)
had been traded.
Trading at the twice weekly sessions is heavily concentrated on a small
number of popular stocks. The rival over-the-counter RM-System, established
shortly after the stock exchange, offers periodic share auctions through its
computerised system, but both systems as well as market operators have faced
teething problems. Only a handful of companies are fully listed and analysts
say investor protection is weak and information inadequate. Some shares are
already considered overpriced, though most analysts remain bullish about
prospects for 1994.
Budapest's stock exchange is also on an upward trend with the BSE index
hitting record highs. Brokers are banking on the influx of foreign money
continuing. So although the BSE index is 50 per cent above year ago levels
it may have some way to go. At 1230, the index is barely above the peak of
March 1991, a substantial fall in dollar and real terms. Prospects for
earnings growth in the medium-term, however, are good and the climate for
new issues is promising too. The privatisation authorities appear ready to
price offerings competitively. The performance of Pick, the salami producer,
has provided an alluring precedent for investors. Its shares have more than
tripled in price, from Ft1,200 at flotation in late 1991, to Ft4,200 now.
Many analysts, however, remain sceptical that 1994 will be a boom year for
the Budapest stock market. Overshooting budget and current account deficits
have pushed up interest rates and are likely to draw investors back to the
government paper market, which in any case dominates turnover.
Even after a fivefold increase in total post-tax earnings for listed
companies as a whole the average p/e ratio, based on estimated 1993 post-tax
earnings and year-end total capitalisation of Ft82.4bn (Dollars 820m), of
the 28 firms on the exchange stands at 20.8.
Liquid shares suitable for institutional investors are particularly
expensive. Fotex, the retailer, is on 22 times 1993 earnings. The figure is
better - 12.6 - if the 10 lossmaking firms are excluded. But the market is
still not cheap.
Higher share prices are also attracting a rash of initial public offerings.
The end of last year saw a batch of four small new issues. Credit Suisse
First Boston, the most active international investment bank in Budapest,
once focused on corporate bond and commercial paper markets but is now
turning its attention for the first time to IPOs.

FT  10 JAN 94 / Emerging Markets: Sterling and dollar strength to be tested
 -Currency Markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Activity on the money markets looks set to be fragmented this week, with
attention focused fairly equally around the dollar, yen and D-Mark.
With the fifth round of US-Japan trade framework talks due to begin in Tokyo
this week, a key question will be the sensitive relationship between the
dollar and yen.
Last year the US government tried to talk down the dollar's rate against the
yen to put pressure on Japan in trade negotiations. But a carefully timed
interjection by Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US treasury secretary, last week
criticised the yen's recent slide. But though the US government now fears
that a weak yen could harm US interests if it deepens the Japanese
recession, Mr Bentsen's intervention is likely to be only partly successful.
After weakening at the beginning of last week, the yen later rose on the
back of worse-than-expected US unemployment data. But most dealers expect it
to fall further this week, possibly touching the Y115 level.
On the dollar side, the publication of a spate of US economic data this
week, will intensify the debate about the pace of the US economic recovery.
Although most dealers expect the dollar's recent bull run to be tempered,
market sentiment remains mixed about the pace of the US recovery.
Consequently the dollar seems set to remain within a small - albeit volatile
 -band.
The D-Mark will also be closely monitored this week after the Bundesbank
attempted to dampen market speculation last Thursday that a rate cut will
occur later this month. Although the D-Mark slightly strengthened after
this, many dealers remain convinced that the ailing state of the German
economy will force a cut soon.
In the UK the publication of labour market data on Wednesday, and producer
prices and industrial production data on Thursday, will fuel speculation
about sterling's ability to break through the DM2.60 barrier. Last week the
pound touched a six-month high, amid growing optimism about economic
recovery.
Meanwhile the mounting concern about the weak Spanish economy seems set to
depress the peseta even further, while the Italian lira's recent rise is
likely to be halted, with more twists in the Italian corruption scandal
expected.

FT  10 JAN 94 / The Markets: Impact of an invisible trend - Global Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Some worldwide economic trends are easy for investors to come to terms with.
Manufacturing is heading east? Buy Hong Kong. Interest rates are falling?
Buy banks and property. Inflation's on the wane? Look for companies with
long-term pricing flexibility.
And so on. Other trends are much harder to translate into investment
decisions. We know the score, but can't quite see how to play it.
That's certainly the case with one of the profound trends reshaping
manufacturing industry: the death of vertical integration. Not only is it
difficult to disentangle the winners and losers; it is also hard to decide
if this is an idea that has come and gone or if its full impact has yet to
be felt.
After all, the sort of complete vertical integration once practised at
Ford's Rouge plant - iron ore in one end, cars out the other - has been out
of fashion for at least 30 years. It's been clear for nearly two decades
that the US car companies' heavy reliance on in-house components put them at
a significant competitive disadvantage to their Japanese rivals. And in the
1980s, industries as disparate as oil and computers started to look again at
how vertically integrated they should be.
The trend though is still making itself felt. Last week ICL, the UK-based
arm of Japan's Fujitsu, turned its factory into an electronics contract
manufacturer, as part of its decentralisation plan. And Coopers and
Lybrand's automobile experts announced that, though the car-makers have
already moved away from vertical integration, you ain't seen nothing yet.
The successful car companies of the future will be assemblers, not
manufacturers, says the Coopers study. Fewer than 10 of the present 25 main
engine manufacturers will survive. With a complete new car costing nearly
Dollars 1.5bn to develop, the study says, collaboration and further
outsourcing is inevitable. New union agreements in Germany, for example,
will allow Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Volkswagen to do much more outsourcing,
following a path already trodden by the US (and bringing Europe more into
line with the pattern always operated in Japan). 'Only final assembly will
remain a core manufacturer skill for product variety and quality reasons.'
What's the investment implication? Well, the study concludes that the most
profitable firms in the industry in the year 2000 will be second-tier
component suppliers, design houses and de-integrated car manufacturers.
First-tier suppliers and integrated car manufacturers will underperform.
Perhaps. But the example of the high-quality bicycle industry, which has
never been vertically integrated, offers an alternative vision of the
future. Its key players are not the assemblers, or the second-tier
suppliers, but the big manufacturers of components, whose brand image and
global reach outstrips the assemblers.
Analogously, the personal computer business is becoming one in which two
first-tier suppliers, Intel and Microsoft, have the global status and the
profits, leaving the assemblers and the second-tier suppliers slim pickings.
Perhaps the first component manufacturer to follow Intel's lead by
advertising 'GKN inside' or 'Nippondenso under the bonnet' will be the car
industry play of the 21st century.
World's best
Whatever the future may hold, 1993 was certainly kind to the car companies,
in stock market terms at least. As the chart shows, car stocks were one of
the top four best-performing global sectors in the FT-Actuaries World Index
last year, and they have now regained all the ground lost to the recession.
The chart shows last year's top four sectors in a longer-term perspective.
(The sparkling performance of the Diversified Consumer Goods and Services
sector probably owes as much to the presence of two of Hong Kong's biggest
companies, Jardine Matheson and Hutchison Whampoa, as to any more humdrum
cyclical factors.)
Only three FT-AWI sectors lost value last year: beverage and tobacco
manufacturers fell 3.8 per cent, under the influence of the Great Brands
Panic. Health and personal care dropped 2.1 per cent as the US, Germany and
 -last week - Italy put the squeeze on drugs prices. Textiles and clothing
also fell, by 0.9 per cent. In global terms, the long-debated switch out of
defensive stocks into cyclicals has already begun.
Ruritania
When the European Monetary Institute holds its first meeting on Tuesday, it
will be easy to make Ruritanian jokes about an institution that has no
offices and no obvious role. Easy, but wrong. The EMI illustrates the trend
towards putting monetary policy in the hands of technocrats, even if as an
institution it has little direct influence.
In the long run, the deflationary bias inherent in such an approach will
provoke political tensions, perhaps fatal ones. Until then however, the
trend will place powerful downward pressure on prices.
If 19th century Russia's governing principle was autocracy tempered by
assassination, the political economy of late 20th century western Europe
will be deflation tempered by popular revolt. The trick will be to estimate
where, and how forcefully, the people's voice will make itself heard.
Debt not equity
The craze for emerging markets is usually described in terms of portfolio
investment in equities, as in the left-hand chart. But this is a small
proportion of the huge flow of funds to the rapidly growing economies of
south-east Asia. The World Bank estimates that Dollars 60bn (Pounds 40bn)
flowed into the region's developing countries last year, of which only
Dollars 4bn was portfolio equity investments. The great bulk was made up of
Dollars 27bn of long-term debt and Dollars 25bn of foreign direct
investments. These figures were exactly double the level of 1990.
Option to default
Old-school investors will be dismayed by one aspect of the rapid
proliferation of option theory at US business schools. The traditional bond
versus equity debate - from the point of view of the issuer - has been
transformed by the notion that a company issuing long-term debt is, in
effect, acquiring an option as to whether to repay the principal, since
bankruptcy is always available as an alternative.
If the purchasers of the debt implicitly under-price this option, issuing
bonds is inherently more attractive than issuing equity, a perception that
might explain the steady drift upwards in the indebtedness of US
corporations in the 1980s.
In the 1990s, issuers started to price the 'option' more realistically, and
gearing fell. Now, balance sheets have been restored by the equity issues of
recent years; and the implicit option price has been falling for many
borrowers as spreads for junk bonds have narrowed. The balance of advantage
may be shifting back.
A contribution to this debate comes in a recent paper from Moody's, the
rating agency, assessing how US credit quality has changed over the past 70
years. It can be summed up in one word: worse. In the most difficult year of
the 1960s, for example, Moody's had to downgrade only 2.9 per cent of
issues. In the 1970s, a much more disturbed decade, the worst year saw 5.1
per cent downgraded, but many years saw 2 per cent or less.
In every year since 1982, however, downgradings have run at more than 5 1/2
per cent of issues outstanding, and in some years the figure has been much
higher. In 1986, for example, nearly one in 10 issues was downgraded; and
though the figure has fallen since 1990, it was still 5.7 per cent in 1993,
otherwise a great year for corporate America.
Will the reversion to 1960s levels of interest rates also see a return to
that decade's relative rating stability? Or has there been a permanent shift
in issuers' attitude towards their debt obligations, as the option theory
implies?
It's hard to tell. One aspect of the Moody's study is entirely unambiguous,
however. An upward revision of a rating is equally likely to be followed by
a downgrade or a further upgrade - there is no 'upward momentum.' But, alas,
'downward momentum' does exist. Once an issue has been downgraded, it is
statistically more likely to go further down than up. In credit quality as
in life: once things start to go wrong they usually get worse.

FT  10 JAN 94 / The Markets: How to monitor economies - Economic Notebook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It has taken longer than the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade
negotiations, but early next month, policy makers around the globe should be
receiving a new rule book telling governments how to monitor their
economies.
After more than seven years work, the 1993 revision to the system of
national accounts (SNA) is about to thud on to the desks of government
statisticians. This internationally agreed method of tracking economic
growth covered 800 pages of typescript in draft form and will spawn a
plethora of national handbooks instructing officials how to apply the new
rules.
The revised SNA will mark a breakthrough of sorts. It is a further step
towards a truly global economy. But many economists and statisticians are
also certain to argue that an opportunity has been missed.
Although many hundreds of recommendations have gone into the new system, it
is still a reworking of a framework first developed in the US, UK and Canada
in the 1940s, when manufacturing industry was dominant, and the countries
concerned were primarily interested in managing their economies to win, and
later recover from, the second world war.
The accompanying panel gives a simplified picture of what the SNA tries to
achieve. Its aim is to record the nature of stocks and flows that are part
of the economic system, applying the same concepts, definitions and
classifications to all accounts and sub accounts. It is rooted in the market
system, where goods and services are produced and traded for a price.
The framework is designed to group transactions and transactors in an
accounting system that is meaningful for economic analysis, forecasting and
policy. It sets out to answer the question: 'Who does what, by what means,
for what purpose, with whom, in exchange for what, with what changes in
stocks?'
That sounds simple. But, as Mr Joseph Duncan, the chief economist of Dun &amp;
Bradstreet and one of America's leading statisticians, has observed: 'The
elaboration of the system quickly generates considerable detail.'
The 'who' alone covers non-financial companies, financial groups, government
institutions, households, which in turn consist either of individuals or
groups, and non-profit institutions. The foregoing question also encompasses
measures of production, income, saving and investment and wealth. The SNA
framework includes domestic and foreign activities, financial and
non-financial transactions, and gives current and real, inflation-adjusted
measures.
Inevitably, trying to fit something as diverse as a national economy into an
accounting framework has created peculiarities. Research and development is
nothing if not an investment in the future. In the SNA, however, it counts
as consumption. The system is especially bad at recording and evaluating
investment in human capital such as education.
The latest revision, which is the first since 1968, sets out to give more
attention to services, and especially financial services, in national
economies. One of the more noticeable changes will be the gradual
disappearance of gross national product from national accounts to be
replaced by gross national income. But there has been no significant change
in the boundaries of production.
The new SNA will do nothing to assuage feminist economists who have strongly
criticised the system, and therefore governments, for largely ignoring the
role of women in societies. It does not take account of housework or their
unpaid contributions to family businesses and farms, which play a vitally
important part in production in developing countries.
Environmentalists have long complained that the SNA does not properly
reflect quality of life issues such as the costs of pollution. Indeed,
pollution, which is destructive, appears in national accounts as a component
of economic growth when attempts are made to clear it up.
However, because the system covers activities of market significance in a
nation's affairs, it does take indirect account of the proceeds of crime.
Nonetheless, 1993 SNA revision has a distinguished pedigree. It was worked
out by officials from the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund,
the World Bank, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
and Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union.
User groups were consulted. A conscious effort was made to involve
developing countries in the work. The Soviet Union and its allies took a
surprisingly strong interest in the discussions in the late 1980s. Since
communism's collapse, the former centrally planned economies have
enthusiastically embraced the national accounts system as part of their
adoption of market economies.
The new system has been harmonised with IMF balance of payments data. It
takes proper account of value added tax, which had still to be applied in
Europe when the SNA was last revised in 1968. As the new millennium draws
near and governments gradually implement the recommendations, economic
information will become much more comparable internationally. In theory,
this should facilitate co-operation on economic policies in an increasingly
interdependent world.
However, it is a moot point whether the framework can fairly reflect the
complexity of a world in which some nations are experiencing revolutionary
changes in social conditions, family structures and the world of work
through the application of new technologies to industrial and commercial
businesses, while others are struggling to develop beyond subsistence
farming.
To be fair, the authors of the SNA have recognised its limitations and made
provision for nations to overcome some of its inflexibility by setting up
'satellite' accounts. These will enable countries to track developments in
health, education, research and development and the environment in a more
logical way without overburdening or disrupting the main framework.
Indeed, for many national accounts' statisticians, the further development
of satellite accounts is a way of developing new techniques that could lead
to innovations for the system as a whole. But for that, national statistical
offices will need greater financial support from governments than has been
the case over the past two decades.

FT  10 JAN 94 / International Company News: Czechs seek new partner for CSA
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   VIENNA, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Czech government is seeking a new partner for CSA, the troubled national
airline, in which Air France, the Caisse des Depots and the European Bank
for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) jointly have a 40 per cent stake.
Mr Jan Strasky, Czech transport minister, said that his government was ready
to buy back Air France's stake, and sell it to another investor.
He denied negotiations were under way with Delta of the US, and suggested a
Czech bank may buy Air France's stake. Analysts say this could only be a
temporary solution to the crisis at CSA.
Air France, which invested in CSA in 1992 in a move to establish a base in
eastern Europe, wants to maintain its participation, but on the condition
that the original shareholder agreement is maintained.
Air France opposes a proposed change to voting procedures in which at least
one of the six foreign shareholders must vote in favour of strategic and
financial decisions.
CSA was partially privatised in 1992, with about 49 per cent of the shares
remaining in state hands.
EBRD paid Dollars 30m for its 20 per cent, with the Caisse des Depots, the
French state financial institution, and Air France paying the same amount
for their shares.
The bulk of Air France's investment was in the form of technical assistance,
training and modernisation.
The Czech airline, burdened with ageing Soviet aircraft, expensive leases on
new aircraft contracted before 1992, and a surplus of employees and
unprofitable routes, has fallen deeply in the red with losses expected to be
about Kcs1.2bn (Dollars 41m) for 1993.
The airline's worsening financial situation has caused growing tensions
between its foreign shareholders and the government.

FT  10 JAN 94 / International Company News: US bank sought Banesto board
changes last autumn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER and PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JP Morgan, the US bank advising Banco Espanol de Credito (Banesto) before
its board was dismissed two weeks ago, recommended to Mr Mario Conde,
Banesto's former president, last autumn that he make changes in the bank's
senior management as part of a recovery plan.
JP Morgan wrote to Mr Luis Angel Rojo, the governor of the Bank of Spain, on
the eve of the intervention to say that it supported Banesto's former
management. However, it has emerged that the US bank had told Mr Conde that
it thought that several senior managers should be replaced.
JP Morgan is believed to have pressed for management changes that could have
been announced early this year as part of its own recovery plan, which would
have involved writing down Pta265bn (Dollars 2bn) of Banesto's assets
immediately and raising new capital by measures including a convertible bond
issue.
Mr Conde, meanwhile, has promised to hold a press conference this week,
which would be his first public appearance since being removed as Banesto
chairman.
It seems unlikely that Mr Conde will seriously challenge the central bank's
intervention. He owns about 4 per cent of Banesto's equity and his personal
fortune may depend on the bank recovering under its new management.
Mr Conde borrowed Pta70bn from Banco Central Hispano (BCH) to participate in
the capital increase, lead by JP Morgan last year, pledging the shares he
bought and the rest of his assets as a guarantee.
However, Mr Conde is likely to add his voice to growing opposition in Madrid
to the possibility that the new Banesto management could write down the
bank's capital, and thus the value of its current shares, before asking
other Spanish banks to participate in a capital increase.
Mr Jose Maria Amesategui, the president of BCH, has publicly opposed a
capital writedown. 'It is the last thing they should do,' he said.
Mr Alfredo Saenz, Banesto's acting president, has told shareholders he is
'studying every possibility' to defend their interests. Opponents of an
equity write-down argue that he should recapitalise the bank by selling
assets.

FT  10 JAN 94 / International Company News: Zenith and Novell in networking
initiative
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Zenith Data Systems, the personal computer arm of Groupe Bull of France, and
Novell, the leading US computer networking software supplier, will today
announce an initiative to simplify and cut the cost of networking for small
workgroups.
The initiative, if successful, will strengthen Novell's hold on the
networking market while throwing an additional lifeline to the troubled ZDS.
The two companies are launching a family of network servers, small computers
which manage the information flow around a network.
Priced between Dollars 999 and Dollars 1,599, the servers claim to bring the
advantages of shared information and services to groups of up to 20 staff
without the disadvantages of traditional networking methods.
Setting up the specialised hardware and software for networking takes
several hours and requires experienced engineers. These networks are too
complex and expensive for small businesses or workgroups.
ZDS and Novell claim the new servers, the Z-Stor family, can be set up in
less than 10 minutes by computing novices.
The Z-Stor units will be the first to use Novell's new operating software
derived from its acquisition last year of Digital Research, a pioneer in
operating software. The software is a competitor to Microsoft's MS/Dos and
Windows, but Mr Bruce Fryer, ZDS product manager, said there was no
intention of using Novell's system on other ZDS computers.

FT  10 JAN 94 / International Company News: Italy's yen bond open to
Japanese investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Republic of Italy's Y300bn global bond offering, due to be launched
today, will be the first yen deal available to all investors in Japan, as
well as Europe and the US, following the liberalisation of Japanese
financial regulations last month. It will be the largest yen offering
outside the domestic market.
Previously, international bonds could only be sold in Japan after a 90-day
lock-up period, and then only to large institutions. Because the Italian
deal has a Securities Registration Statement, it can be placed with both
institutional and retail investors in Japan.
The process is similar to registration with the Securities and Exchange
Commission in the US market, and allows underwriters to sell bonds to a much
broader investor base.
Daiwa Securities, one of the arrangers of the transaction, said that 'the
whole transaction could be absorbed in the domestic market, but that's not
the purpose of the deal'. If it were placed solely in the domestic market,
it would be likely to become illiquid.
The seven-year issue is expected to be priced to yield 40-45 basis more than
the No. 140 Japanese government bond due June 2001. Following a further
rally in the Japanese government bond market last week, this would give a
yield of about 3 1/2 per cent.
According to Mr Alberto Giovannini, head of the Italian Treasury's
international borrowing programme, the pricing reflects an improvement in
Italy's performance in the bond market in the last year.
However, with elections due later this year, Italian bonds could again
become volatile in the face of political uncertainty.
Foreign borrowing for 1994 has not been set, but Mr Giovannini said that it
would remain around 4 per cent to 5 per cent of total debt. Last year, Italy
borrowed Dollars 12.5bn in international markets.

<TEXT>
MIM Holdings, the Australian mining group, has sold its 4 per cent interest
in Renison Goldfields Consolidated, in a deal worth ADollars 43.7m
(USDollars 29.3m).
The sale follows a review of non-core assets and was undertaken at ADollars
5.50 a share, or ADollars 12.8m below MIM's book value for the stake.
It is believed that the shares, which were sold through Potter Warburg, the
Australian broker, were bought by a single offshore entity.
The ADollars 260m takeover bid by the Normandy Poseidon group for fellow
Australian minerals group, Aztec Mining, has been put on hold by legal
action.
Aztec is seeking further disclosure from Poseidon Gold, the Normandy
Poseidon subsidiary which is making the bid.
The hearing, in the Federal Court, has been adjourned until January 12.
