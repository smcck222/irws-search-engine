FT  10 JAN 94 / UK Company News: EFM Dragon Dollars 80m senior loan note
issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EFM Dragon, an East Asian investment trust, has issued Dollars 80m (Pounds
54m) of 15 year senior loan notes. It is believed to be the first UK
investment to make this kind of issue, writes Bethan Hutton.
The notes, which have a fixed coupon of 7.26 per cent, were placed with US
institutional lenders.
The trust currently has net assets of about Pounds 350m and only a small
amount of gearing. Once the proceeds of the issue, arranged by Hambros Bank
and Robert Fleming, are invested, the trust will be approximately 20 per
cent geared, a relatively high level for its sector.
Mr Hamish Buchan, an investment trust analyst with NatWest Capital Markets,
said the deal appeared to be designed to avoid currency risk.
'They are borrowing effectively in a matched currency, because so many
currencies and economies in the East Asia region are dollar denominated or
dollar linked', he stated.
Mr Michael Balfour, manager of the trust, described the coupon of 7.26 per
cent as 'very attractive', in the light of projected growth rates for
economies in the region of 7 to 8 per cent a year.
The issue will give the trust flexibility to buy into markets at times of
weakness.
Mr John Szymanowski, an investment trust analyst with SG Warburg, noted that
current investment regulations meant that the interest would have to be paid
out of dividend income rather than capital growth from the fund.
Dividend levels on shares in south east Asian markets tend to be low, but
the effective rate of about 1.5 per cent spread over the whole fund should
be possible to meet, he said.
The impact on dividend income to shareholders should be outweighed by
improved capital gains.

FT  10 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Buying the Bactroban with the bath oil -
Why SmithKline Beecham has reshaped its consumer brands side
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SmithKline Beecham, the pharmaceuticals group, will today set the seal on a
year-long reorganisation of its consumer brands business by giving it a new
name. In future, the business, which last year provided almost a quarter of
the group's Pounds 5.2bn turnover, will be known as the consumer healthcare
division.
Behind this apparently trivial detail lies a drive to ride a wave of change
sweeping through the world pharmaceuticals industry. SB aims to sharpen the
international marketing thrust which it, and many rivals, believe will be
increasingly important to success in the future.
The most powerful impetus is the industry-wide stampede to generate more
business from over-the-counter drugs, as ballooning health budgets force
governments everywhere to squeeze prescription medicine costs.
'Ten years ago, increasing OTC sales was tactically right. Today, it is
strategically right', says Mr Harry Groome, chairman of SB consumer
healthcare.
Competitors have drawn the same conclusion. Six months ago, Glaxo,
Warner-Lambert and Wellcome joined forces to develop and sell OTC drugs. A
year earlier, SB formed a joint venture for similar purposes with Marion
Merrell Dow of the US.
History has endowed SB with some advantages in consumer marketing. It is
relatively more exposed to consumer products than most of its large rivals,
thanks to brands like Lucozade and Ribena soft drinks, Macleans toothpaste
and Tums antacid tablets.
However, not all the brands fitted the company's newly- defined vocation as
a healthcare supplier. Last year, it disposed of products including
Brylcreem hairdressing, Badedas bath oil and the Silvikrin and Vosene hair
care brands.
The streamlining leaves the consumer healthcare division focused on three
main businesses: OTC drugs, currently about half its total sales; oral care,
including toothpaste and brushes, which accounts for a further quarter; and
nutritional products.
Mr Groome reckons the business will get off to a flying start this year when
it launches in Britain a non-prescription version of Tagamet, its
best-selling anti-ulcer drug, designed to treat heartburn. It also plans to
market over the counter in the US anti-smoking gum and patches developed by
Marion Merrell Dow.
Other candidates for OTC treatment include Bactroban antiseptic cream and
its Relafin anti-arthritis drug. The company also sees a promising market in
home diagnostic kits. By next year it reckons it will have five OTC products
each generating annual sales of more than Pounds 100m.
Its confidence is inspired by the US, where sales of the most popular OTC
drugs have increased on average two and a half times five years after they
came off patent. That growth has offset their lower net profit margins
which, at 10 to 15 per cent of sales, are half those on best-selling
prescription drugs.
However, industry analysts point out that the OTC business has pitfalls. An
OTC version of Tagamet will have to do a similar job to the prescription
drug with a much lower strength. It also risks competing directly with Tums
as an antacid treatment. And once Tagamet patents finally expire, rivals
will be free to make it. 'The market is going to be much more competitive',
says one analyst.
SB has spent the past year girding for that challenge by overhauling its
international marketing, which had been hampered by the company's division
into loosely-linked geographic units. 'There was no way to drive a cohesive
marketing or product development strategy worldwide, because it quickly ran
into geographic barriers', says Mr Groome.
After studying successful consumer products manufacturers, including
Unilever, Mars and Procter &amp; Gamble, SB set up six teams, each responsible
for managing a product category. Headed by proven marketing executives and
backed up by research and development staff, the teams are free to co-opt
managers from the company's national subsidiaries.
The new approach is already paying dividends. Mr Groome says the division's
sales rose by about 11 per cent in 1993 after stagnating in 1992.
Tighter cross-border co-operation has reduced the number of different
toothbrush designs SB sells around the world, cutting manufacturing costs by
Pounds 1m a year.
'Better co-ordination hasn't just saved on costs,' says Mr Peter
Glynn-Jones, SB's head of corporate strategy. 'It means that if something
has been done once by a group of experts, you can be sure it's right.'
Product development has also been speeded up. Mr Glynn-Jones says a new
toothbrush with a flexible head has been developed in 40 per cent of the
time needed under the old system. SB aims to launch it in all its main
markets in two years, instead of the four it would have taken previously.
The next challenge is to extend products across frontiers. This has advanced
slowly since SB was formed in 1989 out of a merger between SmithKline French
of the US and the British Beecham group.
Though the healthcare division's biggest markets are in the US, Europe and
Japan, the only places outside Britain where many former Beecham brands,
such as Horlicks, are sold are Commonwealth countries. Furthermore, the UK
is still the only market in which all the division's three businesses are
active.
Mr Groome says SB is considering launching nutritional drinks such as Ribena
and Lucozade in the US. It also wants to broaden its product range in China,
where its Contac anti-cold treatment is already selling well.
However, the division's ideas for expansion do not end there. It is also on
the look-out for acquisitions and believes further strategic alliances will
play a role. 'We take a very pragmatic approach,' says Mr Groome.

FT  10 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Pharmakopius seeks Stock Exchange listing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pharmakopius, a 10 year-old specialist international healthcare research and
development company, is to seek a listing on the London Stock Exchange.
The group, which is based near Oxford, undertakes contract research and
development work and provides the other services needed before a new drug
can be licensed. Its customers include a wide range of pharmaceutical
companies.
Dr Richard Smith, Pharmakopius' founder, chief executive and main
shareholder, said the the flotation will probably be by way of a placing
with institutional investors early this year and is likely to value the
group at between Pounds 20m and Pounds 30m.
The issue is being sponsored by Allied Provincial Corporate Services.
Dr Smith, a former Reckitt and Colman director of research and development
with more than 20 years' experience in the pharmaceutical industry, founded
the company in May 1984 as a specialist consultancy. His close adviser is Mr
Ronald Wing, a former managing director of Reckitt and Colman.
Since then the range of services offered by the group has been expanded to
include all aspects of pharmaceutical product development from the end of
the discovery process to obtaining product licences - including preparation
of the important 'data sheet.'
Although turnover has been relatively flat throughout the recession at about
Pounds 3.5m the group has continued to trade profitably despite substantial
investments, mainly in specialist staff.
The group currently employs a core full-time staff of some 75 people, mostly
highly qualified scientists.
Its client base of more than 150 includes some of the largest international
pharmaceutical companies like Bayer, Roche Nicholas, Smith &amp; Nephew and
Wellcome.
Although it faces competition from the many small contract clinical research
companies in the UK and has a few large competitors in the US, Dr Smith
claims Pharmakopius is distinct from the the majority of healthcare
companies.
The company expects to raise between Pounds 5m and Pounds 6m in new money
through the flotation. The new funds will be used to expand the group's
international operations and to further enhance its services to the
pharmaceutical industry and strengthen its management team.
In addition the funds will be used to exploit the recently-acquired
worldwide rights to a broadly based portfolio of prescription and
over-the-counter products which are held by its subsidiary, Alpha
Healthcare.

The paper, packaging and office supplies group is expected on Wednesday to

The reason for the reduction is a further fall in paper prices, the result
of low demand and competition from cheap imports from Germany, as well as
weakness in the corrugated box market. Production has been affected by the
rebuilding of a machine at Smith's Kemsley mill.

FT  10 JAN 94 / China to launch Dollars 100m fund in London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The investment arm of China's Guangdong provincial government is launching a
Dollars 100m (Pounds 67.5m) direct investment fund which will be listed on
the London Stock Exchange. It will be the first Chinese development fund to
be endorsed by a state government.
The Guangdong Development Fund will invest in a wide range of projects in
what is China's wealthiest province, and the management role of the
provincial government should ensure rapid deal flow.
A subsidiary of Guangdong Enterprises - the Guangdong government's
investment arm - is to invest Dollars 10m in the fund. Barclays de Zoete
Wedd, the sponsor to the issue, will invest a similar amount, and it is
planned that a further Dollars 80m will be placed out to US and European
institutions.
Since the 1992 visit to Guangdong by Deng Xiaoping, China's senior leader,
alerted international fund managers to the changes taking place in southern
China, there has been a flood of China funds listed, primarily in Hong Kong,
New York and Dublin. Many of these funds have been slow to invest beyond the
Chinese and Hong Kong stock markets, and most of the asset appreciation has
come from Hong Kong-listed China concept stocks.
Mr Victor Chu, a veteran China investor whose First Eastern China Investment
will be co-manager of the fund, claims the Guangdong Development Fund will
be fully invested within 15 months, and only 10 per cent can be invested in
equities. He said: '1994 is going to be a difficult year in China. Even good
state companies will find it difficult to expand capacity, but this will
create investment opportunities.'
The Guangdong Development Fund has already signed letters of intent for up
to five projects which would absorb around 25 per cent of its capital. The
fund is looking to invest in infrastructural projects and light industries
within Guangdong province, which borders Hong Kong.

FT  10 JAN 94 / GM sets US profit target after turnround

   DETROIT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
General Motors of the US, the world's largest vehicle maker, has set the
target of achieving a net profit on its North American automotive operations
in 1994 after three years of heavy losses, Mr Jack Smith, chief executive,
said last night.
GM, which still lags the financial performance of Ford and Chrysler, its
domestic US rivals, had achieved an operating break-even on its North
American automotive operations in 1993 before interest and tax, he said.
This represented a turnround of more than Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.7bn) since
1991 and of Dollars 4.5bn in 1993 alone, Mr Smith said.
Mr Smith, who became chief executive in November 1992 after a boardroom
coup, warned that GM's North American production costs were still high, and
that the group's balance sheet was 'still too weak'.
However, GM's Opel/Vauxhall car and light commercial vehicle operations in
Europe had remained 'significantly in the black', said Mr Rick Wagoner, GM
finance director.
GM Europe was the most profitable volume carmaker in Europe last year, in
contrast to the heavy losses suffered by its rivals such as Volkswagen and
Ford of Europe. It is understood to have achieved a profit of Dollars
400m-Dollars 500m in 1993, in spite of a fall of around 15 per cent in west
European new car sales. Mr Wagoner said GM Europe's financial performance
should improve in 1994.

FT  10 JAN 94 / Industrialists subpoenaed in UBS case
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Terry Smith, one of the City of London's best known investment analysts,
is serving subpoenas on three leading industrialists as part of his case for
unfair dismissal against UBS Securities, the investment bank subsidiary of
Switzerland's biggest bank.
He has filed subpoenas in the high court for the attendance at his case of
Sir Colin Marshall, chairman of British Airways, Sir Allen Sheppard,
chairman of Grand Metropolitan, and Mr Robert Montague, chairman of Tiphook.
Mr Smith was sacked by UBS in October 1992 after he refused to cancel
publication of a book, Accounting for Growth, which is critical of the
accounting techniques used by many of the UK's biggest companies, including
the drinks group Grand Metropolitan. He believes he was dismissed in part
because of complaints about the book from GrandMet and other companies,
though UBS has denied this. It said he was dismissed because he breached
internal procedures for vetting the contents of the book.
The trial, which begins later this year, is likely to be a focus for the
long-running City debate on whether analysts are free to write impartial
reports on companies which are the customers of their firms.
GrandMet's then finance director, Mr David Nash, complained about publicity
the book was receiving a few weeks before Mr Smith was suspended by UBS on
August 12 1992. The company was an important foreign exchange customer of
UBS, carrying out deals generating monthly income for UBS of around Pounds
100,000.
Sir Colin Marshall, a non-executive director of GrandMet, is thought to have
reiterated GrandMet's concerns to UBS. At the time, Sir Colin was also chief
executive of BA - he is now chairman - which was one of UBS's most important
corporate broking clients.
The subpoenas ask Sir Colin and Sir Allen to produce documentation
concerning telephone conversations they had with Mr Rudi Mueller, chairman
of UBS's London operations, in summer 1992, and with each other. Sir Colin
is also asked for documentation concerning a telephone conversation he had
with Mr Miles Emley, then a corporate finance director at UBS, on August 6
1992. Mr Emley is now chairman of printing group St Ives.
Mr Montague's subpoena asks him to produce documents relating to a telephone
conversation he had with Mr Mueller on the book in the summer of 1992.
Tiphook, which ran into financial difficulties last year because of its debt
in excess of Pounds 1bn, was not at the time a corporate broking client of
UBS but it became one later.
UBS is suing Mr Smith for breach of copyright in relation to the book. Mr
Smith is suing UBS for breach of contract and unfair dismissal. He is
claiming around Pounds 600,000 in lost remuneration and legal costs.

FT  10 JAN 94 / Company News (This Week): Germany due for a respite from
shocks - Metallgesellschaft/Siemens
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The worst should be over by Wednesday. By then, Metallgesellschaft's
shell-shocked shareholders and bankers should have delivered their verdict -
along with pledges to stump up DM3.2bn (Pounds 1.25bn) - on the new
management's rescue plan.
Provided there are no further unpleasant surprises from the metals, mining
and engineering group, things should start to improve on Thursday. That is
when Mr Heinrich von Pierer, chairman of Siemens - the epitome of German
corporate conservatism - will reflect on a sound year and perhaps offer some
tangible evidence of economic recovery.
Mr Kajo Neukirchen, the new Metallgesellschaft chairman, is also expected to
make an appearance before the press to throw more light on how he hopes to
take the group forward.
Although the financial rescue package is the work of Deutsche Bank and
Dresdner Bank, his role should not be under-estimated. One banker enthused:
'I'd love to see what the poor blighter can do when he gets to run a good
company.'
Mr von Pierer is in that fortunate position. At the Siemens press conference
he will review the group's 1.3 per cent earnings gain for last year. Given
the sea of red ink engulfing much of corporate Germany, it was as welcome as
the plan to invest DM2.4bn in a new plant in Dresden.

FT  10 JAN 94 / Unlikely duo in the world of entertainment: The merger of
Blockbuster and Viacom for the Paramount bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is a blockbuster of a deal, in both name and nature, but the Dollars
8.4bn (Pounds 5.67bn) merger agreement unveiled on Friday night by cable
television company Viacom and video retailer Blockbuster Entertainment is
getting unenthusiastic early reviews on Wall Street.
The deal is the most startling alliance yet to emerge from the
five-month-long takeover battle for film and book group Paramount
Communications, in which rival bidders Viacom and QVC Network have gathered
around them allied media and telecommunications companies.
It also looks a considerable coup for Mr Wayne Huizenga, Blockbuster
chairman, who in seven years has turned the business from a tiny chain into
the world's largest video retailing empire. Blockbuster agreed last
September to provide Dollars 600m to back Viacom's bid. On Friday, it agreed
to put up a further Dollars 1.25bn in return for Viacom stock, allowing
Viacom to increase the amount of cash in its cash-and-stock bid for
Paramount. At the same time, Viacom has agreed to take over Blockbuster via
a stock swap worth some Dollars 8.4bn - a deal meant to go ahead
irrespective of whether the alliance wins Paramount.
Wall Street is unimpressed. First, the deal seems a convoluted way of
keeping highly-leveraged Viacom in the battle for Paramount, particularly as
the new offer is in important respects inferior to the offer already on the
table from QVC.
Viacom has increased its cash offer for just over 50 per cent of Paramount's
stock from Dollars 85 a share to Dollars 105, which compares with Dollars 92
from QVC. But Paramount has lowered the value of the securities being
offered for the remaining 49 per cent to Dollars 52, based on Friday's
closing stock prices, compared with around Dollars 75 from QVC. Viacom's
total bid is thus worth around Dollars 78 a share, while QVC's stands at
Dollars 83.
Second, Wall Street is sceptical as to what Viacom will gain from a merger
with Blockbuster, apart from immediate access to cash, a better chance of
winning an already expensive Paramount, and a somewhat stronger balance
sheet.
At first glance, the two appear complementary. Viacom's main business is the
creation of entertainment 'software', through cable television channels such
as MTV, the pop music network, and Nickelodeon, a channel for children.
Blockbuster's main business is entertainment distribution, through video
rentals. Some analysts question the benefits of linking these two sides. The
rental business looks very vulnerable to the revolution in the US
communications industries. This promises a world of inter-active,
multi-media home entertainment, where consumers can call up a movie at the
touch of a button, rather than trudging to a video store.
Blockbuster is the creation of Mr Huizenga, who started out as a rubbish
collector and built this into Waste Management (now known as WMX
Technologies), America's largest rubbish removal company. He retired from
Waste Management in 1984 and three years later invested in the then tiny
Blockbuster.
Blockbuster now accounts for some 15 per cent of the US home video market
and has 3,500 stores in nine countries. Even though the US rental market is
mature, its income and revenue (Dollars 142m and Dollars 1.2bn in 1992) have
been growing strongly, partly by capturing business from smaller rivals and
partly from diversification.
Blockbuster is now the third largest record retailer in the US, and has a
separate joint venture with Britain's Virgin to develop music mega-stores.
None of Blockbuster's diversifications will add significantly to the
impressive software assets that would be fielded by a merger of Viacom and
Paramount, and analysts are sceptical of the claims by Mr Sumner Redstone,
Viacom chairman, that Blockbuster gives him 'extraordinary capacity to
exploit worldwide opportunities' in the entertainment business.
Admittedly, Viacom is not paying much of a premium to gain control of
Blockbuster. Shareholders are being offered around Dollars 31 a share, which
compares with Blockbuster's close on Friday of Dollars 28 1/4 and a 52-week
high of Dollars 34 1/4 .
The 70-year-old Mr Redstone will retain control of the combined group, with
61 per cent of its voting stock, while Mr Huizenga, 55, will become
vice-chairman.
Friday's deal has left some analysts wondering not only if Mr Redstone has
the firepower to win Paramount, but whether he may have just hitched a ride
into the brave new multi-media future on the technological equivalent of a
horse and buggy.

FT  10 JAN 94 / Company News (This Week): Flurry of trading news to test
anecdotal hopes - UK Retailers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After conflicting messages from Dixons and Boots last week, a clearer
picture of retailers' fortunes in the vital Christmas trading period may
emerge this week, with at least four leading groups due to make trading
statements.
Dixons rushed out a profits warning last Thursday after Christmas sales
little better than 1992. That contrasted with anecdotal evidence of brisk
trading in the final weeks before Christmas and first week of the new year
sales.
Boots, however, reported sales up 7.2 per cent, and is thought to be more
representative of the sector.
On Tuesday jewellery group Signet (formerly Ratners) and Storehouse, the
clothing group comprising BHS, Mothercare and Blazer, will report. Signet
shares were hit in December by rumours that sales were down. But at least
one analyst expects the group to announce a recovery after two years of
like-for-like (excluding new stores) decline, forecasting second-half growth
of 5-6 per cent and some margin improvement.
Storehouse is expected to follow a good Christmas last year with sales
increases of about 6 per cent at BHS and 10 per cent at Mothercare.
Body Shop, which last year reported an 8 per cent drop in like-for-like
Christmas sales, is expected to report better news on Thursday. Analysts
expect flat like-for-like sales for the second half, but growth of 4.5 per
cent including new stores.
Friday's statement from catalogue retailer Argos is also expected to be
positive. Like-for-like sales are expected to be up about 4 per cent in the
second half.
Next and Sears are still considering whether to make statements, while
Kingfisher is tipped to make its first ever Christmas statement before the
end of the month. Marks and Spencer is waiting until mid-February before
revealing its Christmas performance.

FT  10 JAN 94 / Fledgling central bank faces struggle: Obstacles remain to
acceptance of EMI as monetary force in Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There are growing signs that the president of the European Monetary
Institute, Mr Alexandre Lamfalussy, will have a struggle to get the
organisation accepted as a significant force in European monetary affairs.
The institute's council holds its inaugural meeting in Frankfurt tomorrow
with difficult questions over the pay and conditions of the staff yet to be
resolved.
There are also differences among the European central banks, who own the
institute, over how far jobs should be allocated on grounds of nationality.
More fundamentally, there are wide divergences between authorities such as
the European Commission and Belgian finance ministry, which see the EMI as
an instrument to force integration in the EU, and others, notably the Bank
of England and Bundesbank, which think its role should be mainly advisory.
Last week, the Greek government, which took over the presidency of the
European Union at the new year, cast doubt on the status of the EMI. Mr
Yannos Papantoniou, the alternate economy minister who will chair meetings
of EU economics and finance ministers until the end of June, said he doubted
whether Mr Lamfalussy would be invited to the monthly meetings of 'Ecofin'
ministers on a regular basis.
Senior European monetary officials say the Greek threat is one of Mr
Lamfalussy's lesser problems. The EMI's statutes make clear that Mr
Lamfalussy can expect to attend ministerial meetings when the functioning of
the European monetary system or broad macro-economic issues are being
discussed - which will be the case with most of them.
The officials consider the first two meetings of the EMI council will be a
significant test of Mr Lamfalussy's influence. But it will only become clear
around mid-year, when key staff have been recruited, whether the EMI will
play an important role in EU monetary policy.
Mr Lamfalussy, a Hungarian-born Belgian banker, is having to build the
institute from small beginnings. He has to recruit four or five key people
soon, including a director-general and department heads.
Meanwhile, many of the officials who served the EMI's forerunner - the
Basle-based EC central bank governors' committee - are returning to their
national central banks at the end of three-year secondments.
Officials say the EMI has 'hundreds of candidates' for senior posts, mainly
nominated by EU central banks, but they cannot be selected until the terms
and conditions of employment are fixed.
Among unresolved questions are whether non-German officials should be given
expatriate allowances as an inducement for living in Frankfurt or whether
there should be some other form of dislocation allowance for new employees
of the institute that does not discriminate against Germans. Mr Lamfalussy
will have to fight for conditions that are good enough to attract high
quality staff to the EMI.
The EU central banks believe the EMI should be kept on a tight budgetary
rein so that there is no suspicion of the extravagant behaviour that marked
the start-up of the London-based European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development.
In the meantime, Mr Lamfalussy is unable to provide the officials to chair
the various EMI sub-committees responsible for guiding the current second
stage of European economic and monetary union. A key test of the EMI's
status will be whether his staff take over such duties when it is properly
operational later this year.
Although tough battles lie ahead, Mr Lamfalussy has one thing in his favour;
he was asked to do the job of EMI president. As long as the majority of EU
states are committed to Emu, they have a vested interest in ensuring that
the EMI plays a constructive part in the process even though the Maastricht
Treaty is vague about the institute's precise role.

FT  10 JAN 94 / Public sector pay rise forecast: Most managers expect to
offer between 1% and 3% despite freeze
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Most public sector workers will get pay rises in 1994-1995 of between 1 and
3 per cent despite the public sector pay bill freeze which the government
hopes to extend until 1997.
An informal Financial Times survey of senior public sector managers found
most confident that they could offer a pay rise at or above the rate of
inflation through efficiency savings and job shedding.
This is true in local government, where a pay rise of 2 to 3 per cent is
being pencilled in, and the civil service, where around 2 per cent is
expected. Similar rises are expected in government agencies and NHS hospital
trusts where collective bargaining is being devolved.
Where new pay systems are established, greater differentiation in pay awards
is likely, with some employees getting considerably more than 3 per cent.
Some of the 1.5m workers covered by the pay review bodies may also break the
3 per cent barrier. The review bodies - covering teachers, doctors and
nurses and armed forces personnel - are expected to submit recommendations
to government by the end of the month.
The government announced in September a pay bill freeze for 1994-1995. The
November Budget extended this to 1997. The freeze does not mean that the 5m
public sector workers will get no pay rise, but that any increase must be
paid for by improved productivity or reduced staff. The freeze follows the
1.5 per cent pay norm in 1993-94.
There was some tension last year when the government sidestepped the review
bodies with its 1.5 per cent limit, but there was no rebellion and the same
is likely to be true this year. On the other hand, some review body
recommendations may be difficult to meet from efficiency savings and might
have to be rejected.
A member of one of the pay review bodies said privately: 'Pay bills are for
the government. Our remit is to recommend a pay rise and that is what we
shall do.' The same member said that, if the government had attempted to
impose a pay norm for the second year running, there might have been open
revolt from pay review members but he added: 'This year's arrangements leave
us sufficient scope to do something useful.'
Aside from the possibility of recommendations for higher pay from the pay
review bodies, the government seems relaxed about the public sector pay
round.
Mr Stephen Dorrell, the financial secretary, wrote last month to Mr John
Monks, the general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, saying that
efficiency savings, and therefore a pay rise, should be possible in 'all
areas of the public sector'.

FT  10 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Bowater
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
When a company is de-rated as sharply as Bowater has been over the past few
months, the suspicion is that something sinister is at work. But in
Bowater's case, it may reflect little more than fashion. After being the
belle of the packaging ball throughout the recession due to its defensive
charms, Bowater is now looking less modish in recovery. The turn of the
investment cycle has resulted in more volatile second-line stocks picking up
speed at Bowater's expense. At its peak, Bowater accounted for some 35 per
cent of the sector's value. That has now slid to 23 per cent.
Although earnings' forecasts for Bowater have remained largely unchanged,
some concerns about its strategic thrust have surfaced. The past two years
have seen a whirlwind of corporate activity, with Bowater spending Pounds
844m on acquisitions and issuing Pounds 630m of new equity. The management -
and the market - have been striving to make sense of this reshuffled pack of
assets. The task has been complicated by some of its new businesses in
cosmetics and medical packaging running into the brunt of recession in
mainland Europe.
It has also proved hard to lift volumes and prices in the UK, ensuring
lacklustre growth in underlying organic earnings. Supermarkets are squeezing
food packaging prices hard and the photographic market remains tough. With
gearing at the year-end likely to be just under 50 per cent and the market
still awash with Bowater paper, Bowater has little option but to make the
best of what it has got. At least its US and Australian operations are
showing more bounce.

FT  10 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: US airlines
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The US transportation secretary's proposals to allow foreigners to increase
their ownership of US airlines from 25 per cent to 49 per cent will raise a
small cheer among high-flying European airlines. The move seemingly
represents a further step towards liberalisation of the skies. But the US
Congress has yet to have its say; it is not yet clear what the US will
demand from European governments in return.
Moreover, at present, all it would mean for European airlines is that they
could buy bigger stakes in loss-making businesses. The US market may have
experienced a pick-up in demand as economic recovery has gathered pace. With
the exception of USAir, all the major carriers have posted third-quarter
profits. But a recent bout of seasonal discounting has again disfigured the
market. The growth of airlines such as Southwest Airlines, which offers
cheap point-to-point services rather than the traditional hub-and-spoke
operations, will also limit the scale of any profits upswing.
US carriers are having to respond to such pressures with ever more inventive
means of cutting costs. United's plan to sell stock to its unions represents
the boldest move. USAir is attempting to cut operating costs by minimising
the time its airplanes spend on the ground. Besides, European carriers'
ambitions to expand in the US may be limited by worries of their own. Most
state-owned European airlines have far more bloated cost structures. There
is also a danger that concealed forms of state subsidy in Europe will keep
excess capacity in the air, with the same devastating impact on industry
profitability as Chapter 11 produced in the US.

FT  10 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Hot property
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The speed of the revival in the UK property market, following its worst
recession in decades, has been remarkable - in stock market terms, at least.
The intriguing question is how much more there is to come. Since sterling's
exit from the exchange rate mechanism, the market value of property shares
has risen almost three-fold to Pounds 15bn. Some companies have shown even
more startling gains. For example, British Land, boosted by the company's
association with the omnipresent Mr George Soros, has seen its shares jump
from 110p to 411p.
Big property companies have taken advantage of the market's enthusiasm to
raise Pounds 1.4bn of new equity. That has given them leeway to buy
properties and shore up strained balance sheets, underpinning dividends and
further enhancing the sector's appeal. Even the wave of new issues has
scarcely dampened investors' ardour.
Investment demand has been driven by comparative yield considerations. With
long dated gilt yields falling below those on property, fund managers have
shown a voracious appetite for both bricks and mortar and their paper
substitute. Some estimates suggest Pounds 10bn of investment money is
looking for a home in property, depressing last year's double-digit yields
on prime London offices to 7 per cent. Likewise, the yield on property
shares has been chased down from a peak of 9.5 per cent at the end of 1992
to 3.5 per cent - although part of that fall reflects dividend cuts. Share
ratings have risen so fast that many property companies are trading at a
premium to net asset values. The tacit assumption is that these asset values
are significantly understated.
However, the surge of investment interest has discouraged owners from
selling both physical assets and shares, further squeezing up prices. Such
is the level of demand that some segments of the market appear in danger of
overheating. Yields on some prime retail sites have dropped as low as 4 per
cent, within range of their historic lows, suggesting some worryingly
indiscriminate buying.
Property has traditionally been viewed as a quasi-equity investment,
providing a good hedge against inflation with the prospect of capital
growth. Yet investors currently seem to regard it more as a bond with a
fixed income stream. That may prove reasonable if inflation remains low and
the comparative virtues of property against gilts and equities remain solid.
But current yields leave little by way of risk premium. The danger comes if
the economy stalls, interest rates rise, rental growth remains elusive and
the government starts tampering with the tenant law.
Such doubts make it unlikely that property shares will keep rising at such a
prodigious rate this year. But while there may be some bumps along the way,
the longer term direction still looks assured. Property remains a highly
cyclical investment and the upswing is still in its infancy. At its last
peak in 1988, the property sector accounted for 4.2 per cent of the equity
market's total capitalisation. Despite the recent surge, it accounts for
just 2 per cent today.

FT  10 JAN 94 / Leading Article: Next steps for the Tecs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The establishment three years ago of the Training and Enterprise Councils
was one of Britain's bolder institutional shifts of recent years, even if
the task of running Tecs has been made more difficult by the government's
ambivalence towards the market failure which called them into existence.
Nonetheless, the Tecs have disappointed the cynics who said they would
emulate Private Industry Councils in the US, which lost business support. Of
the three tasks bestowed upon Tecs - organising the training of the
unemployed, raising the skill level of the employed and stimulating
enterprise - they have performed the first more efficiently than the state
and have made some progress in the last two. Although of uneven quality,
their industry committees have become useful forums for corporate networking
and their compact size has made them ideal sites for experiments, such as
those now taking place on job creation. Above all, the Tecs have tapped a
large reservoir of regionally-based civic capitalism, which recognises that
there is a collective interest in public economic goods such as an effective
training system.
If that enthusiasm is not to wither away, the Tecs cannot stand still. As
spelt out in a book published today by Professor Robert Bennett and
colleagues at the London School of Economics, Tecs have not become powerful
agents of business self-administration, such as the German chambers of
commerce, which many people - including Mr Michael Heseltine in late 1980's
exile - wanted. Given Britain's individualistic business culture and the
character of the government it was unrealistic to suppose that they would.
The relevant question now is whether pushing them gradually in this
direction will remedy the problems identified.
Less impact
In the field of stimulating economic development, and channelling public
support for business, the answer is a qualified yes. Tecs have had less
impact than hoped in this field partly because they have had very little
money for it, but also because of their hybrid character and the fact that
they overlap with other institutions such as local authorities, chambers of
commerce, and various government agencies, including the trade department's
latest offspring, the one-stop-shop. Merging chambers and Tecs, despite
their different traditions, makes sense in terms of increasing the impact of
both types of organisation and in creating local bodies that are big enough
to provide most government business support services. Some form of
compulsory registration for companies with more than 100 employees would
also be worth considering.
Independence
The improved information about local companies that would come with
registration could also improve the Tecs' contribution to in-company
vocational training. But to make a real impact here Tecs need more financial
and operational independence from government. That means either allowing
them to levy funds from local businesses or to share in the business rate,
or some mixture of the two. German success in vocational training has many
causes, including a collective bargaining system which makes it difficult
for employers to poach skilled workers, but the existence of well-funded
chambers to administer the system, financed by local employers and a local
tax, is one cause of that success.
Britain cannot hope to copy German success by simply borrowing its
institutions. But if Tecs are going to become more than sophisticated
quangos for training the unemployed they need to acquire something akin to
the strength and independence of German chambers. It is an open question
whether bodies devoted to raising business quality in general, and
in-company training in particular, should also have a monopoly in running
large-scale training programmes for the unemployed.
It is time for ministers to recognise that the process of granting greater
autonomy to former public sector agencies across the economy needs to be
applied to the Tecs. Targets would still need to be set and quality
rigorously monitored by the Tecs' paymasters, but enabling Tecs and chambers
to merge would be a useful step along the way.

FT  10 JAN 94 / Leading Article: The ghost at Nato's feast
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
'What really matters is Bosnia,' said a senior Clinton administration
official quoted in the FT last September, discussing prospects for the Nato
summit which opens in Brussels today. If by January 10 Nato was 'there, and
doing something', the summit would be a success. But if Sarajevo had 'gone
down the tubes' it would be a failure.
January 10 is here, and Nato is not 'there'. At least, it is no more there
than it was in September. The headquarters unit provided by Nato for the UN
Protection Force (Unprofor) is still there, but the force is no more able
than it was four months ago to protect the civilian population of Sarajevo
and other towns from Serb shelling, which continued cynically through the
Christmas 'truce', if anything at greater intensity than before. In August
Nato threatened air strikes if the 'strangulation' of Sarajevo continued. It
persists but there have been no air strikes.
The UN commander in Bosnia, General Francis Briquemont - a representative of
Nato's host nation - has just resigned, 'exhausted' after six months in the
job and publicly deploring the 'fantastic gap' between UN Security Council
resolutions, 'the will to execute those resolutions and the means available
to commanders in the field'. The resolutions in question authorise the use
of 'all necessary means' to ensure that relief supplies reach their
destination. Yet tanks intended for the protection of UN troops trying to
reopen the airport at Tuzla, so that relief supplies can be flown in, are
stranded at a base in Serbia because Bosnian Serb leaders (against whose
forces the protection is required) are allowed to block their passage; and
the Serbian government extracts payment from the UN for allowing supplies
through, to offset the effect of sanctions which the UN has itself imposed.
Peace agreement
When the US offical spoke in September of Nato being 'there, and doing
something', she alluded to the plan for a Nato force, including 25,000 US
troops, to supervise the implementation of a peace agreement between the
three Bosnian parties. Today not only does a peace agreement seem further
off than ever, but no one any longer believes, after the retreat from
Somalia and Haiti, that US troops would be sent to Bosnia even if a peace
agreement were reached.
In short, while Sarajevo may not quite yet have disappeared 'down the
tubes', in other respects conditions in Bosnia are precisely those required
for the Nato summit to be a failure. Nor can Nato get away with blaming the
UN for this state of affairs. The same governments call the tune in both
organisations.
Military muscle
Only Nato could provide the political and military muscle for the UN to
enforce its resolutions in Bosnia, and it has conspicuously failed to do so.
No wonder, then, that central European governments lack confidence in it. No
wonder they interpret the proposed 'partnerships for peace', not as a bold
strategy for gradually expanding Nato's zone of peace but as a fudge,
designed to avoid any risk of confrontation between Nato and Russia.
Indeed who can expect that Nato would stand up to Russia if it lacks the
courage to stand up to Serbia and Croatia? Who can be surprised, when Serbia
is allowed to get away with ignoring frontiers and forcibly moving
populations in the name of ethnic solidarity, that Russian leaders from
Boris Yeltsin downwards increasingly invoke the same principle in dealing
with other ex-Soviet republics, and seem increasingly disposed to defend the
involvement of Russian military units in conflicts beyond Russian borders as
a contribution to 'stability' or even 'peacekeeping'?
Of course, Russia is not Serbia and Yeltsin is not Milosevic. There is still
a chance that Russia under Mr Yeltsin's leadership will remain democratic
and friendly to the west. Nato leaders do not want to jeopardise that
chance, and recognise that any Russian regime will be concerned with the
stability of Russia's neighbours, particularly those with large ethnic
Russian populations. But that does not mean they should encourage anyone in
Russia to think that such interests can be asserted legitimately or with
impunity by military force. Further passivity in Bosnia is all too liable to
have that effect.

FT  10 JAN 94 / Scramble for seats on mystery ride: As the Nato summit gets
under way in Brussels, David White questions its role and relevance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'An alliance whose purpose is not the intention to wage war is senseless and
useless' - Adolf Hitler
The challenge the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation faces as it completes
its first 45 years is to prove Hitler wrong. Since the cold war dissolved in
the late 1980s it has been scraping around for a new sense of purpose. As
leaders of the 16 allies meet for their summit in Brussels today, not only
the future membership of Nato is in question but also the nature and
continued relevance of the organisation.
A previous summit in London in 1990 proclaimed Nato to be 'the most
successful defensive alliance in history'. Its success as a front against
the Soviet Union was such that it never had to put troops into action. Its
effectiveness derived from two factors: a powerful military capability, and
the political will to use it if necessary.
But its reason for existing - the Red Army - is now a thing of the past. It
is possible that rebuilt Russian forces might again become a threat to
western Europe. But - for all the sabre-rattling of Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky,
the ultranationalist Russian politician - they are not considered one now by
military chiefs. As a British admiral graphically put it: 'The light house
keeper at Muckle Flugga (northern Shetlands) hasn't seen a periscope for
years.'
The cold war held Nato together and guaranteed a level of public support.
Now the only public enthusiasm for Nato is evident in the nations of central
and eastern Europe which would like to join, and which most of the allies
are anxious, for now, to keep at bay.
The summit, called by the US last year, was not meant to be about
enlargement, but that is the issue which will dominate it. The strong
nationalist showing in last month's Russian elections has exacerbated Nato's
quandary - giving countries such as Poland all the more reason for seeking
Nato's protection, and Nato all the more reason to tread cautiously and
avoid reinforcing Russians' belief that the world is ganging up against
them.
Nato's leaders have yet to persuade President Boris Yeltsin it would be in
Russia's own interest to have central Europe securely linked to western
European institutions. The alliance is caught between the risk of playing
into the hands of Russian extremists by favouring expansion and that of
apparent appeasement of Moscow, allowing it to veto Nato decisions.
But there are more problems involved in expanding Nato than Russian
reactions. One question is whether Nato is prepared, or militarily able, to
protect borders further east. Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, put
it in blunt terms at the Royal College of Defence Studies last month: 'Are
the US Congress, the House of Commons, the French Assembly, the Bundestag
solemnly ready to guarantee with the lives of their citizens the frontiers
of, say, Slovakia? If not, or if not yet, then it would be a deceit to
pretend otherwise.'
Another is where to draw the line. Although there is general acceptance in
Nato that membership will eventually grow, no consensus exists as to how
many might join. Limited expansion could create its own tensions and
divisions. 'What if we take Poland in but not Lithuania (which last week
became the first ex-Soviet republic to apply)?' asks one seasoned Nato hand.
'What if Hungary but not Romania?' On the other hand, the more countries
join, the harder it may be to maintain a semblance of cohesion within the
alliance. And the less cohesion, the less advantage there is in joining.
The fact that Greece and Turkey were both Nato members may have helped
contain their dispute over Cyprus - an example often cited by central
European officials. But that was during the cold war; it might not be so
with future quarrels.
If there is one art Nato has become adept at, it is papering over its
difficulties. The summit will open the way to enlargement in principle,
without naming names, fixing a timetable or setting criteria for membership.
Yet it will be understood that Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary and
Slovakia will be put in the fast track, nobody will join for several years
and that membership will be conditional on real democratic credentials.
Nato now wants to be about shared political principles. In the past - during
its first 25 years when Portugal was a dictatorship, during the colonels'
Greece or periods of military rule and repression in Turkey - democratic
principles took second place to common strategic interests.
Mr Volker Ruhe, German defence minister and an early champion of
enlargement, has said that the central European nations will not be joining
the old Nato but a new one. By that he meant a co-operative Nato not geared
to fending off Russia. The trouble is that what the central and east
Europeans want to join, essentially, is the old Nato - to feel safe against
Russia. Mr Antony Lake, President Bill Clinton's national security adviser,
warns that if they join too quickly their worries about Russia could become
'a self-fulfilling prophecy'.
Nato's holding tactic - thought up by the US in October - is to offer
military co-operation agreements to all the countries of the former Warsaw
Pact, Russia included, and assorted other European nations. Partnership for
Peace agreements - PFPs in Nato-ese - will allow countries to draw closer to
Nato by exercising and possibly peacekeeping alongside Nato forces. They may
be a prelude to membership, but not automatically. And, crucially for the
applicant countries, they will not include mutual defence guarantees.
Mr Yeltsin has given a guarded welcome to the proposed military ties, which
should start to be negotiated this year. Countries such as Poland rather
grudgingly accept the idea, suspicious that they are being fobbed off.
President Lech Walesa told the Washington Post that Nato's approach to
enlargement was 'shortsighed and irresponsible'.
Nato's hope is that the co-operative programmes will winnow out the serious
candidates - those that can make a real contribution - and groom them for
membership, which could roughly co-incide with entry into the European
Union.
But what sort of Nato will they be joining? Will the US still be as engaged
in it? Nato went through many internal spats in the cold war but there was
no question of the US commitment or of America's vision of its own security
being anchored in Europe.
Allies expect Mr Clinton to deliver a strong reaffirmation of Nato's
importance and the need to keep it as a transatlantic forum. But it is
questionable how long the US can maintain public support for keeping even a
reduced troop force of 100,000 in Europe. Nato would be severely weakened
without the US contribution - both for vital military assets such as
long-range transport and satellite surveillance, and for the weight the US
pulls in the world.
In the past three months the Clinton administration has bombarded Nato with
initiatives, fleshing out its Partnership for Peace idea, seeking Nato
involvement in 'counter-proliferation' to deal with potential new
nuclear-missile powers, and proposing new Combined Joint Task Forces which
would link France more closely into Nato military planning for operations
outside allied territory.
Nato has unique military resources. No other organisation could provide the
sophisticated co-ordination needed for tasks such as enforcing the no-fly
zone in Bosnia. The Gulf war effort three years ago also drew heavily on
experience of working together in Nato.
However, allies' military forces are being rapidly run down. With no clear
threat scenario, there is now longer any yardstick for judging what forces
Nato needs or what kind of fighting it should train for. There is a risk
that, like the excess tanks and artillery of the cold war now being
dismantled, Nato's military structure will rust away. It would then be an
alliance on paper, which might be worth little if put to the test.
'The trick,' says a former senior Nato diplomat, 'is how to ensure that the
habits of co-operation that we have developed over the last four decades are
not thrown away.'

FT  10 JAN 94 / The declining relevance of Europeans: America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As President Bill Clinton makes his first visit to Europe, it is perhaps
worth reflecting that the US is rapidly cutting loose from its European
roots. The point is not just that Pacific rim and western hemisphere
countries have become more important trading partners, it is that a
diminishing proportion of Americans have personal or ancestral links with
Europe.
Sharp changes in immigration patterns, magnified by differences in fertility
rates, are transforming the US into the world's first truly cosmopolitan
society. Demographic trends point in a direction that would have been
unthinkable to the founding fathers: by the second half of the 21st century,
Europeans and their descendants - the ethnic group that has dominated the US
for more than 200 years - may well be outnumbered by other racial groups.
In parts of the US this non-European future has arrived. Look at the
register of new home buyers in affluent Orange County, suggests Mr Peter
Morrison, a demographer at the Rand Corporation in California. The top four
surnames are Nguyen, Lee, Garcia and Kim. Miami, now jokingly referred to as
the 'capital of Latin America', is comparably diverse. As Time magazine
noted in a special report on 'multicultural' America, nearly 60 per cent of
Dade County residents speak a language other than English at home.
The US was set on its present multicultural path by a radical (but much
underrated) change in immigration policy in the mid-1960s. On humanitarian
grounds, strict limits on overall immigration were eased and rules
allocating quotas according to the existing population mix scrapped, ending
the bias in favour of northern European countries such as Germany, Ireland
and Britain. In 1940, 70 per cent of immigrants came from Europe. By 1992,
over 80 per cent were from Latin America, the Caribbean and Asia.
Immigration policy was revised three times in the 1980s. The net effect was
to relax entry controls further and reinforce the shift towards Asian and
Hispanic immigrants. Those entering as refugees were mainly Asian while the
beneficiaries of a generous amnesty were mostly Mexicans. The principle
governing legal immigration remains 'family unification'. But since only
recent immigrants seek to bring in family members, and since they are mainly
Asian or Hispanic, the effect is to magnify the new bias in favour of Asia
and Latin America.
So far there seems little risk of an outbreak of European-style xenophobia.
In multicultural America, gangs of skinheads do not amuse themselves by
beating up foreigners. But a nation that is composed of immigrants is
beginning to wonder whether present policies are not excessively liberal. In
the past 10 years, nearly 9m immigrants have entered the US legally - the
largest number since the turn of the century. A further 5m people are
reckoned to have evaded border patrols.
Signs of unease are multiplying. Polls suggest that nearly two-thirds of
voters now favour stricter controls on legal immigration (Americans
overwhelmingly support tougher curbs on illegal aliens). Politicians have
not hesitated to exploit the changing public mood. Mr Pete Wilson, the
Republican governor of California, boosted his popularity last year by
urging the repeal of laws giving automatic citizenship to the children of
illegal immigrants. And he shocked the liberal establishment by arguing that
illegal immigrants should be denied access to the state's over-subscribed
education, health and welfare services.
Some of the growing hostility towards immigrants can be put down to
temporary economic difficulties: when jobs are scarce and local budgets
under pressure, an influx of poor families is bound to be unpopular. The
fact that immigration is so regionally concentrated (in states such as
California, Florida and New York) only adds to the strains. California, in
particular, is inundated, having admitted more immigrants in the past decade
than in the preceding 50 years; 40 per cent of the population of Los Angeles
is foreign born. A third of legal and half of illegal immigrants settle in
the state.
But the fears about immigration run deeper. The underlying problem is that
the decision to loosen immigration policy and shift the mix towards Asians
and Hispanics was not the result of a vigorous public debate. Americans did
not consciously decide their country was under-populated and insufficiently
cosmopolitan. The big changes of recent decades have taken nearly everybody
by surprise.
As a result, the social and financial strains are proving severe.
Highly-educated northern Europeans were easily assimilated. Low- skilled
Hispanics and Asians are not. Yet the federal government does not properly
compensate cities such as Los Angeles for the huge costs of absorbing this
new class of immigrant. And many politicians seem bewildered by social and
educational changes under way - such as strident demands for a genuinely
multicultural curriculum - that are a direct result of their policies.
By global standards US immigration policy is benign. While narrow-minded
Europeans exploit 'guest workers', the US readily offers citizenship. While
the likes of Canada and Australia scoop up the cream of the immigration pool
by imposing strict educational and skill requirements, Uncle Sam remains
big-hearted enough to welcome the underprivileged. It is uplifting to see a
nation settled by Europeans erecting a multicultural tent large enough for
every race and creed. Yet it is troubling that so few Americans seem to
grasp what a bold and principled policy they have embarked upon.

No wonder the shares in state-owned banks are missing out on the current
bullish run at the Athens Stock Exchange.
The fact that the Greek Socialist government is replacing the chairmen of
half a dozen state-controlled banks with its henchmen is itself
unremarkable. But eyebrows were raised even in Athenian banking circles when
none other than Soulis Apostolopoulos pitched up as the new chairman of Bank
of Attica, a small state bank specialising in trade with the rest of the
Balkans.
Until recently, Apostolopoulos, who headed a Greek state trading agency,
ITCO, during the Socialists' last turn in the 1980s, was in jail. He had
been convicted of fraud relating to the Great Maize Scandal of 1990, when
the Greek government had to pay a Dollars 2.4m fine because ITCO sold a
cargo of Yugoslav maize to Belgium, using forged Greek certificates of
origin to avoid paying EU countervailing levies.
Another, er, surprise is the return of Panayotis Korliras as chairman of
Greece's third biggest bank, Ionian Bank, a job he held under the previous
Socialist administration. All have not forgotten how, during his watch at
the parent company, a luxury hotel on Rhodes was built by the bank's
subsidiary, Ionian Hotels. For the past two years, the latter has been
trying to dispose of the edifice, which cost Dr14bn to put up, a piffling
Dr10bn over budget.

The London gold market, where just five firms fix the price every day, is an
incestuous place, even by City standards. Hence a frisson of excitement at
the admission of two new boys to the club in the space of a week.
The mighty Deutsche Bank is now the proud owner of Sharps Pixley, and Edmond
Safra's Republic National Bank of New York swallowed Mase Westpac, the
remnants of the old Johnson Matthey Bankers. Both parents are big gold
traders in their own right, but had hitherto lacked the cachet of membership
of the club which has fixed prices since 1919.
New arrivals at exclusive gatherings should know how to behave. No surprise,
then, to see Keith Smith, former boss of London's oldest bullion firm,
Mocatta &amp; Goldsmid, leave retirement to take over as non-executive chairman
of Republic's new operation, Republic Mase Bank.
Smith caught the gold bug in the 1950's, when he started working for Edward
E Mocatta. Republic Mase's managing director, Dick Gazmararian, used to work
for him, and Edmond Safra, one of the world's canniest private bankers, has
been a friend for over 30 years. Indeed, it was Safra who persuaded Smith to
take on the new job.

Business sponsorship window of the moment must be the United Nations' 50th
anniversary, due in 1995 - a 'unique opportunity to reposition the UN' as
the hopeful press release puts it.
No-one would deny the organisation needs a facelift. This week, for
instance, UN sources expect Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali to take
the unusual step of backing the appointment of a special 'force inspector'
for former Yugoslavia. His brief? To hasten investigations into months-old
allegations of black marketeering, prostitution and the transporting of
people from Sarajevo for payment.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the US futures industry's
regulator which is habitually on the look-out for sharp trading practices
among its charges, seems to be experiencing a bit of churning itself - of
chairpersons that is. The Commission is now greeting the third acting
chairperson selected for it since President Clinton took office a year ago.
Latest to step into the breach is Clinton fund raiser and farmer's daughter
Barbara Holum, taking over from Sheila Bair, a Bush appointee who had been
in place since August. Holum, sworn in as a commissioner only in November,
is no time-server either.
The game of musical chairs began last January when staunch Bush supporter
Wendy Gramm, chairwoman since 1988, handed in her notice. Commissioner
William Albrecht was provisionally roped in, but he departed in August,
leaving a lonely duo of commissioners, one of whom was Bair.
Seeing that the last two chairpersons and two of the three interim heads
have been female, there has obviously been no particular problem in
achieving gender 'balance' for this would-be politically correct
administration. But frustrated regulatory staff suspect that the White
House's ambitions extend to redressing ethnic balance, and the names of two
female black Chicago lawyers are circulating. Just what kind of political
point is there to be made, though, after all the dithering?

FT  10 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Unitary councils will not spawn
'despised quangos'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN WILSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mrs Pat Case, Conservative opposition leader of Lancashire County
Council (Letters, January 6), complains that the Local Government
Commission's moves to restructure local government are out of line with the
Conservative government's transfer of responsibilities for health, education
and waste management to trusts and company boards.
Mrs Case also claims that replacing large and remote county councils like
Lancashire with smaller, all-purpose unitary councils will spawn a system of
'despised quangos' because the new authorities will have to work together on
some functions such as strategic planning, county archives and the lord
lieutenancy.
If Mrs Case despises quangos so much, she would do well to understand what a
quango is. My dictionary says a quango is a quasi-autonomous national
government organisation - in other words, a body which can more or less do
what it likes and derives its existence and power from national government.
That sounds to me like a perfect description of the health trusts and
opted-out school governing boards which Mrs Case seems to like so much.
Conversely, it does not fit at all the handful of joint arrangements,
overseen by locally-elected councillors, which the new unitary authorities
will need.
Replacing the present system of separate county and district councils with
unitary councils will put right the mistakes of the 1974 reorganisation,
eliminate waste and an unnecessary layer of bureaucracy, save money, be more
responsive and accountable and, as commission chairman, Martin Easteal,
says, produce a structure which can take back powers from the quangos.
The real threat to local democracy and to ordinary people's ability to
control their local services comes precisely from those quangos - and not
from the pending reorganisation.

FT  10 JAN 94 / Some common sense on US and China
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
During most of the post-war period respectable western opinion worried about
the low living standards and slow growth of Asian, African and Latin
American nations, who made up the so-called Third World. Now the fashionable
worry has flipped over; and it is that the best-performing of these
countries will overwhelm the established industrial nations.
Some of the alarmism has been fuelled by a recondite piece of research,
which appeared in an appendix to the May 1993 World Economic Outlook
published by the IMF. This reassessed the share of different parts of the
world in global GDP. It did so by converting currencies on the basis of
their estimated domestic purchasing power rather than at their market
exchange rates.
The result was that the established industrial countries had their share of
world output in 1990 reduced from 73 to 54 per cent, and the developing
countries had theirs raised from less than 18 to more than 34 per cent. The
most famous finding of all was the trebling of China's share in world GDP
from 2 to 6 per cent. These new estimates have travelled by bush telegraph
among the economic talking classes, where they are now in vogue.
They should not in fact have caused any surprise. It has long been known
that GDP comparisons at market exchange rates exaggerate the poverty of many
Third World countries. The Canadian economist and national income expert,
Dan Usher, observed a couple of decades ago in his travels in Indo-China
that most people had a tolerable, if basic, standard of living. Yet their
pay, expressed in say dollars or D-Marks, would have brought rapid
starvation to anyone having to live on it in North America or western
Europe.
The reason for the discrepancy is also well-known. Market exchange rates
establish a rough equivalence of purchasing power for different currencies
in terms of products which feature in international trade. The stress is on
approximation. The US economy appeared to drop from nearly a third to barely
more than a quarter of the world's total, due first to the overshooting and
then to the undershooting of the dollar in the 1980s.
In Third World countries there is a systematic tendency for non-tradable
products and services to sell at very low prices relative to tradable ones.
Travellers know how cheap are restaurant meals, shoe cleaning and other
personal services in poorer countries. The new estimates have had less
effect on growth rates than on total output.
Developing countries have been growing faster than established industrial
ones at least since the mid-1970s. Since 1984 developing country growth
rates have averaged almost 5 per cent per annum, against 2 1/2 per cent for
developed ones. In the two years to 1994 the IMF expects developing
countries to grow by nearly 6 per cent per annum while industrial countries
grow by only 1 1/2 to 2 per cent. Among the latter, the dear old European
Community is projected to grow by between  1/2 and 1 per cent.
These estimates incorporate an additional 0.8 per cent added to the average
annual growth rates of developing countries and a subtraction of 0.1 per
cent for the developed world, as a result of the rebasing exercise. Without
these corrections the developing world would still have shown a more rapid
growth rate than the industrial west.
But the rebasing does make a difference. Old figures showed rapid Third
World growth was necessary to offset its high population growth. Output per
person seemed to be growing at an approximately similar pace in both areas.
The new estimates suggest Third World growth is faster even on a per capita
basis.
Even the latest corrections may not go far enough. They still suggest the
US, with a fifth of China's population, has a total real GDP 10 times as
large. But in any case the discrepancy in living standards remains huge.
Surely a gradual catching up by China is welcome - although it does not
justify turning a blind eye to human rights abuses in China or its adjacent
territories.

FT  10 JAN 94 / Grounded after a bumpy flight: Stephen Wolf, stepping down
as chairman of United Airlines, speaks to Paul Betts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Stephen Wolf is paying the ultimate price to secure the future of his
company United Airlines, the largest US carrier.
To win up to Dollars 5bn of wage and productivity concessions from the
company's 80,000 employees to compete against the new breed of low-cost US
domestic airlines, Mr Wolf has agreed to step down as chairman and chief
executive in June. The airline's president, Mr John Pope, and its legal
counsel, Mr Larry Nagin, are also leaving.
Mr Wolf conceded that his decision to go was not only unusual but
unprecedented. 'I am a little melancholy about leaving, but I am also happy
because I think the employee buy-out of the airline and the wage and benefit
concessions they are making is the best alternative for the company, its
employees and its shareholders,' he said during a visit to London last week.
Just before Christmas, the United board accepted an offer by its workers to
take a majority stake of between 53 per cent and 63 per cent in the airline.
If the buy-out, the biggest in US corporate history, is completed as
expected by June, Mr Wolf, once reported to be the highest-paid executive in
America, will probably walk away an even richer man than he already is. His
three-year contract will be honoured.
His last published salary was Dollars 575,000 in 1992 and he also holds
considerable stock options and shares. Mr Wolf said he would not be
receiving an additional golden handshake and that he would have preferred to
continue earning his salary by actively running the airline during the next
three years.
'But the pilots and machinist unions wanted me to leave and constitute a new
board as a condition for the buy-out and wage concessions and I will do
that,' he said.
Ironically, Mr Wolf will leave United a much stronger airline than when he
was brought in to revive the sleeping giant of US aviation at the end of
1987. Although he never won the hearts of the union leaders, he has
succeeded in transforming United, once focused on the US domestic market,
into a powerful global carrier with probably the most extensive network in
the world and Dollars 2bn of cash reserves.
In the 1980s, United, known in the US airline industry as the '900lb
Gorilla' because of its size, lost its way as well as its number one
position in the industry to American after a crippling strike by its pilots.
The company dropped its strategy of a global integrated travel group by
divesting itself of its Hertz rent-a-car business, and its Westin and Hilton
International Hotel activities.
'We returned the company to its core airline business, modernised what was
one of the oldest fleets in the industry and put into place what I believe
is the best route structure of any airline in the world,' Mr Wolf said. 'We
also made some improvements in our costs but our labour contracts inherited
from the days before deregulation simply could not work in a low cost
airline environment.'
United's unit costs are much lower than those of its big European
competitors. 'British Airways' costs are about 35 per cent higher than ours,
Lufthansa's about 90 per cent more and Air France 100 per cent plus higher,'
said Mr Wolf. But the cost base was still much too high to compete against
the new low-cost carriers in the US domestic market.
Faced, in addition, with the worst postwar recession in the air transport
industry Mr Wolf slashed United's long-term capital spending programme by
Dollars 5.5bn this year on top of an earlier cut of Dollars 3.6bn in 1992.
'At the end of 1992 we also took one significant run against operating costs
by laying off 2,800 people, but it was not enough and we went to the union
leaders to try to make a significant adjustment to our overall labour
costs,' he explained.
United had three options. 'The first was the status quo: do nothing until
the market picks up. But it was no longer just a cyclical problem, it was a
structural one. US consumers were telling us they wanted low fares as well
as safe airlines. So the status quo was no option,' Mr Wolf said.
The second was to co-operate with the unions to achieve a dramatic change in
working practices and wage and benefit costs. The third, he explained, was
to forge ahead irrespective of the unions with a sweeping restructuring
programme including the setting up of separate low-cost airline subsidiaries
within the company, contracting out service and aircraft maintenance
operations, selling assets and laying off thousands of workers.
'That last option would have been very difficult and confrontational: we
would have faced a labour conflict to the nth degree,' he said.
From the day he took over at United, Mr Wolf has had to wrestle with
particularly hostile labour relations, especially from his pilots. His
appointment was welcomed by Wall Street because of his reputation as an
expert in rescuing troubled airlines.
After learning the airline industry ropes in 15 years at American, he spent
short stints as head of marketing at Pan Am and president at Continental.
Then, in less than three years as head of Republic, he turned the Minnesota
loss-making airline to profit and paved the way for a merger with Northwest.
He moved on to Tiger International where he pushed its Flying Tiger air
cargo business to record profits before it was merged with Federal Express.
But if United's motto has long been 'Fly the Friendly Skies', Mr Wolf found
few friends in the airline. Since the 1985 strike, the airline's pilots have
sought to take control of the company and put their man in the top slot. Mr
Wolf's salary when he joined - he was reported to have earned Dollars 6m in
his first year largely as a result of compensation for stock options he left
behind at Tiger International - won him even fewer friends among the
airline's employees. But he has persevered in his strategy to return United
to the number one position in the US industry. Mr Wolf said he would
continue working aggressively to try to complete his strategic plan before
stepping down in June. He has just announced further expansion in Pacific
services including a substantial increase in flights to China: the company
is about to open a huge new maintenance base at Indianapolis: he is
continuing lobbying hard to win approval from the UK government to fly from
London to the airline's main hub of Chicago: he is in the thick of
negotiations with the German and US government authorities to get a
marketing alliance with Germany's Lufthansa off the ground.
'When I hand over the ignition keys to my successor United will be a
superbly engineered company,' he claimed in an ironic reference to Mr Gerry
Greenwald, a former vice-chairman of the Chrysler motor company widely
tipped as the unions preferred candidate to head the airline.
Mr Wolf said he had made no plans for the future. He hinted he might
consider a job outside the industry, but others expect he is likely to be
approached by United competitors.
His biggest consolation is that he believes he is setting a new trend in the
US airline industry. 'Our big US competitors will also have to react and I
can see them all, American, Delta, USAir eventually taking the same employee
participation road. That is the price of survival,' Mr Wolf said, donning
his Stetson hat and riding out, a tall lonesome figure, in the western
sunset.

Sir, Russians learned not to believe everything they saw on television long
before the launch of TV ads promising a fortune in return for a
privatisation voucher ('Yeltsin plans curbs on abuses of privatisation by
voucher', January 5). Our representative survey of Russians, supported by
the Foreign Office Know-How Fund, found the great majority of Russians have
a realistic idea of a voucher's worth, estimating its value at Rbs9,000
roubles (about Pounds 5). Moreover, 82 per cent reckon their voucher will
decline in value.
We can extend to Russia the aphorism of a pioneering student of public
opinion: 'Ordinary people are not fools'.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ANDREW CAMPBELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your newspaper should be congratulated for predicting Daimler Benz's
problems as early as 1988 ('Lingering Doubts about Daimler', November 14,
1988). Christopher Lorenz's excellent analysis of Daimler Benz was based on
examining the capability of the parent company to manage and create synergy
out of the diverse businesses it had acquired in the previous three years.
He concluded that success was unlikely, that Daimler would need to make
significant divestments, and that even then the logic of the company
'remains doubtful'.
This approach to understanding diversified companies is called parenting
theory. It focuses on the skills of the parent. The logic for
diversifications is then the fit between a business and the parent's skills.
This way of thinking about diversified companies has become the established
creed among top academics and consultants and in Lorenz's writing on other
companies. Why is it absent from your leader, 'Diversify and Die' (January
4)?
Vague discussions about the merits of specialisation versus balance or about
the dangers of 'having all your eggs in one basket' are a poor substitute
for rigorous analysis of parenting skills in order to understand why some
conglomerates make sense and others do not.

Sir, Mr Herbert E Meyer (Letters, January 1/2) argues that the proper role

while entrepreneurs make growth happen.
Perhaps one of the proper roles for government, as automation increases and
the requirement for employees decreases, will be to ensure a reasonably
equitable distribution of those employment opportunities which exist?

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr STEPHEN MCNAIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, David Soskice's support for continued expansion of higher education
(Personal View, January 6) will be welcome to all those who believe the UK's
future lies in a high-skills, knowledge-based economy. However, he fails to
note the scale of recent and current change in higher education itself, both
in who participates and what is provided.
It is now three years since school leavers ceased to be the majority of
entrants to higher education in England and Wales: while the numbers of
young people entering higher education expanded in the 1980s by 28 per cent,
the expansion was in mature students (77 per cent), mature women (147 per
cent), and part-timers, notably part-time postgraduates (164 per cent).
This is a signal that many people are recognising the priority of lifelong
learning: we cannot afford to wait for young people with new skills to
replace those currently in the labour market.
The second point is that traditional forms of higher education do not
necessarily produce the kind of skills which the Employment in Britain
survey points to. Developing these reliably and economically in most
universities calls for change in what is taught and how it is taught. But
the government's Enterprise in Higher Education programme has invested for
the past five years in curriculum development aimed precisely at these kinds
of skills. Fifty-four universities, working with thousands of employers,
have introduced changes affecting the experience of a growing proportion of
their students.
There is a long way to go, but the UK may not be as far behind the US as
David Soskice fears. We certainly share the hope that the present
consolidation will prove to be a minor diversion from the long-term trend of
expan-sion.

FT  10 JAN 94 / Arts: Billy Roche's The Cavalcaders - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A whisper of warning.
Billy Roche's The Cavalcaders at the Royal Court may seem initially
disappointing to anyone who saw the same author's Wexford trilogy at the
Bush. The theatre is bigger, the play is not. It may be that the small Irish
town is running out of subjects.
The plays in the trilogy were set respectively in a snooker hall, a betting
shop and the belfry of a parish church. Each had a background that was
lively and contributed to the plot. The Bush has a large stage relative to
the space for the audience. That produced an appropriate intimacy.
Cavalcaders is set in a shoe-menders' shop, and a fairly dingy one at that.
Whereas from the belfry, you might look out from the tower and see the whole
of Wexford, here you will see at most the hairdressers' across the road and
perhaps a few people walking down the street. Even to do that, you have to
stand on a chair and lift the curtain.
This is a self-inflicted handicap by a playwright who has made so much out
of specialising in details. There is a lot of movement in a betting shop or
even a pool room; the scope for action at a cobblers', where most people
seem to fail to collect their shoes, is limited.
Perhaps this is deliberate and Roche has become more introverted. Certainly
there are fewer jokes; the piece is tinged with sadness throughout. The
central character, Terry, almost never leaves his shop; his girlfriends come
to him, and object when he never offers to take them out.
The central prop, apart from the shelf of old shoes, is an upright piano
usually covered by a canvas. It is around the piano, however, that the
cobblers gather in their part-time vocation, for - when not mending shoes -
the Cavalcaders are a male quartet singing sentimental, poppish songs, some
of which they write themselves. They pose with great style, and it is a mark
of their achievement as actors that, as a singing group, they never seem to
be either wholly good or wholly bad. The in-between is captured to
perfection, which may be what Wexford is all about.
The structure is weaker than one expects from Roche, and even harder to
follow when you read the text than when you see it on stage. Neither Terry's
wife nor her lover appear and we learn almost nothing about them. Suddenly
the play goes into flashbacks, which is almost always a suspect way of
storytelling.
Yet of the quality of the acting and the infectious nature of the Wexford
language there can be no doubt. Terry, played by Tony Doyle, is the most
senior of the shoe-menders. His young girl friend Nuala (Aisling O'Sullivan)
has great freshness, but in the background there is his older friend Breda
(Marie Mullen). The two women get on well enough together, a reminder
perhaps that in Wexford nothing much changes because there is nothing much
that can change.
The language is soft, sometimes deliberately inarticulate, almost never
without feeling. There are times when you straining not to miss a word.
Billy Roche himself plays Josie, one of the Cavalcaders and cobblers.
Direction is by Robin Lefevre, and if you've never been to Wexford, you
might as well start from here.

Television has long tended to be embarrassed by true experts (too hoity
toity, too serious) and instead has chosen for its presenters
'personalities' with a bit of knowledge and a lot of enthusiasm. In the arts
we have recently had the nun who spent her previous life in a caravan, and
now here comes stand-up comedian Billy Connolly to show us The Bigger
Picture. In the first of a six-part series on Scottish art, Connolly goes to
Rome to explain about the Grand Tour. Well, programme makers are as keen on
an expenses-paid trip to Italy as you or I would be (7.30 BBC2).
Perhaps we have previously had drama and documentary series on the same
subject transmitted simultaneously, but I cannot recall them. Last night
BBC2 screened its documentary series 'Auction', and tonight ITV begins its
drama Under The Hammer. Richard Wilson plays the motorcycle-riding
international art expert at 'Klinsky's', the auction house invented by John
Mortimer (9.00).
Cutting Edge (9.00 C4) looks into feuds between neighbours, over dogs,
noise, almost anything.

FT  10 JAN 94 / Arts: Allied-Lyons gives RSC Pounds 3.3m - Sponsorship
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The sponsorship year got off to the best possible start with the
confirmation on Friday that the Royal Shakespeare Company had found a much
needed corporate backer. Allied-Lyons, the foods to drinks company, is
giving the RSC Pounds 3.3m over the next three years, the largest arts
sponsorship in the UK.
It was wonderful news for the RSC which in December said goodbye to Royal
Insurance, its main corporate prop, which had contributed Pounds 3.5m over
six years. Allied-Lyons has decided to concentrate its arts and community
expenditure behind one venture, and asked consultants Scope Communications
to come up with alternatives. Of its three suggestions the RSC was the
obvious choice for chief executive Tony Hales. 'It's one of the best
international brands in the UK,' he says.
Allied-Lyons money will support four productions a year in the UK,
educational work, and, of vital importance to the sponsor, international
tours. Most of Allied-Lyons' profits come from overseas and the first fruits
of the link will be harvested in an imminent RSC tour of the Far East,
including Japan, where the company works closely with Suntory.
Hales intends to lock the company in tightly with the RSC. It will involve
its 70,000 employees, and its shareholders, with discounted seats, and help
to promote RSC tours through its pub outlets. It may also back individual
productions with its brand names and use the RSC in advertising.
For the RSC the sponsorship is vital. Although director Adrian Noble has
lopped Pounds 600,000 off the overdraft since his arrival, it still stands
at Pounds 2.4m, and the windfall royalties from its production of Les
Miserables are now slackening. This valuable new commitment to the RSC
increases confidence all round.
*
Researching the effectiveness of sponsorship is a costly business, so few
supporters of the arts, and even fewer arts organisations, contemplate doing
it. However the Tate Gallery has set in motion a long-term evaluation of the
impact of sponsorship on its exhibitions. It is conducted by MORI, and is
costing the Tate over Pounds 20,000.
MORI is questioning visitors to the Gallery; past, present, and potential
sponsors; and MPs and opinion formers, and gaining their reactions to
sponsorships at the Tate. Or whether, indeed, there are any reactions.
Favourable results will contribute towards a marketing package to offer
potential sponsors. If there are criticisms, the Tate's business development
department, under Fay Ballard, will try and remedy them.
Since 1990 the Tate has raised Pounds 4.25m in corporate sponsorship. As
well as regular backers, like BP, which has just paid for another annual
rehang, and Tate &amp; Lyle, which has renewed its funding for the Friends of
the Tate, in 1994 Ernst &amp; Young is involved in its first major sponsorship
by putting a substantial six-figure sum behind a Picasso show, and
Reed-Elsevier comes in later in the year, helping to stage a Whistler
exhibition.
Award ceremonies in the arts stimulate attention, reward performers, and
appeal to sponsors. Classical music has never really succeeded in getting a
prize-giving off the ground to match the Booker, the Whitbread, the Olivier,
or the Prudential, partly because its scope is so international.
The Classical Music Awards sponsored by Kenwood, the Japanese electronics
company, seems to have plugged the gap. The 14 prizes, bronze sculptures by
Dhruva Mistry, will be distributed at the Albert Hall on January 21 to
category winners - singer (male and female); orchestra; composition; etc. -
from eight countries. The international spread of the awards makes it costly
 -Kenwood invests Pounds 350,000 in organising the event, plus another
Pounds 150,000 on promotion - but is happy enough with the results to have
signed up for another two years.
*
In theory sponsorship was to be the icing on the cake for major arts
companies, with the cake being well fruited with state support through the
Arts Council. Events are changing that, most strikingly in the financing of
the London orchestras. The contribution of grants to their financial
viability has fallen steadily, with sponsorship making up much of the
shortfall.
This is especially true of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, which on
December 15 discovered that its Arts Council grant for 1994-95 was to be cut
by 25 per cent to Pounds 300,000, or around 5 per cent of its turnover, and,
on the same day, finalised a Pounds 500,000 a year sponsorship with Classic
FM.
The RPO becomes the station's national orchestra, taking concerts from its
London platform around the UK. The RPO hopes that its success in forging
such a substantial sponsorship, the largest in the UK classical music scene,
will prod the Arts Council into raising its grant, at least for its touring
activities.
*
What's in a name? Around Pounds 20,000 for the Blackheath Concert Hall. It
was planning a Christmas production of Prokofiev's Peter and the Wolf. One
of the board was great friends with Peter Wolff, who runs S. R. Gent, a
clothing supplier to Marks &amp; Spencer. Peter Wolff liked the idea of backing
his opera. As a first time sponsor the BSIS gave the concert halls a
matching Pounds 20,000, which helped support a Victorian Circus. And Wolff
is so happy that he wants to make Peter and the Wolf an annual event.
*
Mobil is one sponsor which sticks in there and positively relishes backing
the controversial. It has just announced another Mobil Playwriting
Competition. Scripts should be in by next August and there is Pounds 40,000
in prize money.
In contrast, Mobil also backs a popular play which tours the country,
offering its regional offices opportunities to entertain clients, its staff
discounted seats, and the wider public the chance to see a production which
is more lavish than most theatres can hope to present these days. Alan
Ayckbourn's Absurd Person Singular is just starting the rounds.

FT  10 JAN 94 / Arts: Rostropovich at the Barbican
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At the Barbican on Saturday night, with a superlative piano-partner in Ian
Brown, Mstislav Rostropovich played the cello. He was in easy, magisterial
form. Not least among the delights of a Rostropovich recital is being firmly
reminded that he is a great artist - a fact that is sometimes muddied in his
appearances as conductor. There, an excess of enthusiasm over technique may
disappoint; sometimes he doesn't transmit his intentions to his orchestra
clearly enough to achieve much more than an excited hubbub, all noise and
confusion. When he does, the result can of course be splendid; but not
always.
On the cello, however, his intentions are directly and gloriously realised.
On Saturday there were two or three passages in which his pitch suddenly
went peculiar (he is going on 68, after all), but they made no difference
whatever. Even in the smallest pieces - a Marcello Adagio, the Rakhmaninov
Vocalise, a racing Humoresque by himself fifty years ago, and most of all in
an encore, Ravel's bijou Habanera - there were penetrating touches of
phrasing and colour, of humour and feeling. Rostropovich is one of those
rare players whose instrument has become his natural voice.
Twenty and thirty years ago, he used to invest Bach's solo suites with taut
drama. Here, the C minor Suite was broad, unhurried, grand and down-to-earth
at once: a ripe musical experience. For the Beethoven sonata originally
announced, he substituted the early, playful variation-set on the duet 'Ein
Madchen oder Weibchen' from Mozart's Magic Flute, to which Brown made his
own sparkling contribution. Early this season, Brown figured in a Nash
Ensemble concert that got off on the wrong foot and grew steadily lamer (as
I reported glumly on this page); it was a great pleasure to hear him rising
to this occasion with such assured, creative finesse.
He matched Rostropovich faultlessly in their crowning exhibit, Prokofiev's
late C major Sonata - for which in 1949 the cellist himself had advised the
composer on the cello-writing. Like other works of Prokofiev's last years,
it is seemingly transparent, tuneful, sectional in an old-fashioned way, and
yet elusively oblique. Here the partners invested its three discursive
movements with glowing conviction and variety, moment by moment; by the end,
we had registered a potent autumnal message, music too precisely expressive
(as in Mendelssohn's famous remark) to be put into words.

FT  10 JAN 94 / Arts: A promising start to 1994 - Architecture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The new year has started very merrily with the amusing attack on Brian
Sewell, art critic of London's Evening Standard. Apparently some of his
articles have caused such offence that several self-important, self-styled
'members of the art world' (presumably they inhabit a different earth from
the rest of us) wrote a letter which, in effect, asked for him to be
silenced.
I can only suppose that some of the 35 signatories had nothing better to do
in the post-Christmas limbo. They accused him of being both homophobic and
misogynist (I'm not quite sure where that leaves him . . . ), ignorant and
hostile when it comes to their kind of contemporary art. On top of all that
they accused the poor critic of, 'sexual and class hypocrisy. They were just
kind enough to say that he was 'very occasionally . . . sometimes
perceptive'.
The fun continued when none other than the Secretary of State for Education,
John Patten, wrote a letter supporting Mr Sewell. He made a very good point
about the 'art world' which applies to certain aspects of the professional
architectural mafia as well: that 'cultural life is only for the self-styled
cultured, a narrow group alternately puffing and then gently 'criticising in
context' each others work'.
Mr Patten went on to say that the letter from the 35 worthies 'marks the
barrenness and imploding nature of so much British intellectual and artistic
life, with a few notable exceptions'.
Critics must have views and express them with knowledge in a way that
provokes debate and interest. I think Mr Sewell is right about the
fashionable shibboleths that dog the visual arts in this country. He is
right to puncture the cloud of putrid political correctness that has
replaced reason and thought in much of the 'art world'. He is also right to
cry out for quality and integrity in art. He is criticised for this elitism
by a group who are so elitist as to be, culturally speaking, almost
incestuous.
This fruity and encouraging debate about criticism in the visual arts is a
promising start to 1994. Also, at last, there is a new chairman of the Arts
Council - Lord Gowrie, who is seriously knowledgeable about the arts, who
will undoubtedly be able to clear up the mess left by his predecessor. He
also loves architecture in an intelligent and thoughtful way - he is a
bridge builder who, I trust, will not underestimate the public as the Arts
Council and its minions has for so long.
Furthermore, I am happy to declare an interest in a new architectural
magazine that will be launched on March 15 in London called Perspectives,
with the object of encouraging the kind of informed architectural debate
that was started by many of the speeches of the Prince of Wales. He was
able, as no architect, critic or member of the 'art world' has been able, to
encourage widespread debate about contemporary architecture. The new
magazine, which will make architecture a live subject, has the support of
the Prince of Wales's Institute of Architecture.
There are also some very encouraging new buildings to write about in 1994.
Richard MacCormac's new student rooms for St John's College, Oxford, also
has generous commissions for works of art as part of the whole project. This
is one of the buildings that will be interpreted at length in Perspectives
and on these pages.
On May 28 the new Glyndebourne Opera House by Michael Hopkins will open. At
about the same time, Eurostar trains should be running into the new Channel
Tunnel rail terminal at Waterloo. This is a dramatic, beautiful place
designed by Nicholas Grimshaw. I was lucky enough to have a preview the
other day and it is remarkable - just as good as any of the grands projets
that architects are always complaining we never build in this country.
I noticed that Nicholas Serota, director of the Tate Gallery, was too
politic to sign the letter attacking Mr Sewell. I imagine he is much too
worried about the decision his trustees are apparently about to make to
offer to convert Bankside Power Station into a Museum of Modern Art. We have
such good architects in Britain at the moment that a new building is surely
the best answer. The conversion of the Gare d'Orsay into a major museum in
Paris was only a partial success. The decision to appoint an old hand at
architectural politics, Gordon Graham, to run a competition for the future
of London's South Bank suggests that plans for the new Museum of Modern Art
should be held over until the Hayward Gallery is demolished and plans are
ready for an art venue of international standard, which London badly needs.
I relish the thought of the opening of the Channel Tunnel making trips to
Europe easier. I wish there was a tunnel to link the UK to the countries of
the formerly communist eastern Europe. The future of cities such as like
Prague and St Petersburg depends on the spread of the work of enlightened
architects, or they risk repeating all our commercial and architectural
mistakes.

FT  10 JAN 94 / Monday Interview: 'We're insiders and usurpers' - Sir
Michael Perry tells Guy de Jonquieres of Unilever's prospects after the
Uruguay Round
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For a group its size - its Pounds 25bn annual sales dwarf the economies of
many of the 150 countries in which it does business - Unilever has long kept
a remarkably low profile. As Sir Michael Perry, co-chairman of the
Anglo-Dutch food and consumer products manufacturer, puts it: 'We have
always believed in letting our brands do the singing.'
Recently, however, Unilever has begun to raise its corporate voice. Early
last month Floris Maljers, Perry's Dutch counterpart, led a group of
Europe's most powerful industrialists in calling publicly on governments to
cut social costs, speed up deregulation and listen more closely to industry.
Soon afterwards, Unilever saw another, more ambitious, lobbying initiative
pay off when agreement was reached in the Uruguay Round trade negotiations.
For months beforehand, top executives had hammered away at the importance of
getting a deal - and the dire economic consequences of failure. In private,
they delivered the same message to the world's politicians.
Now the deal is done, what is in it for Unilever? The direct benefits look
surprisingly modest. Because the group, which has plants in 80 countries,
makes many products locally, few are vulnerable to trade barriers.
None the less, it expects increasingly to move products across borders and
to supply worldwide from a single source so as to capture scale economies.
It is also relieved to see the resolution of the long-running trade dispute
over oilseeds, of which, as the leading margarine producer, it is a big
purchaser.
But for Perry, the Uruguay Round is as important as a guarantee of continued
free trade as for its specific provisions. Had the Round collapsed, the
world trade system would probably have dissolved into regional trade blocs
as wealthier economies banded together behind protectionist walls.
That, he admits, would not have all been bad news for Unilever, given its
wide international spread. 'One can argue that in the short term at least, a
measure of protection is not something people sniff at. It has advantages if
you happen to be an insider.'
The snag was that those advantages would have been bought at the expense of
poorer economies, such as India and Africa, where Unilever also has big
stakes. The closing of industrialised markets could have threatened economic
development in China, where it is rapidly stepping up investments.
That matters a lot to Unilever, which relies increasingly for growth on
fast-expanding, and highly profitable, operations outside the stagnant
markets of western Europe and north America. Another big plus from the Round
is that pressure is kept on developing countries to plug away at broader
economic liberalisation.
Still, the process is not a one-way bet. In India, where the group's local
subsidiary is the second largest publicly-quoted company, liberalisation
will make it easier to do business - but also for new competitors to enter
the market. 'So we have a foot in both camps. We're insider and usurper,'
Perry says.
Nor does he expect the political path ahead to be entirely smooth. 'The big
problem these governments face is that, if they are democracies, they have a
rather sad and difficult imperative - they want to be re-elected next time
round. If ripping away bureaucracy and protection leads to massive
disadvantage for local interests, there is a political price attached.'
That dilemma is not confined to the developing world. Perry foresees 'new
stresses and strains' as the European Union wrestles with declining
industrial competitiveness and high labour costs, while facing growing
pressure to underwrite political stability in the countries of central and
eastern Europe by opening its market to their exports.
'The reality is that right next door, in east Germany, the Czech Republic
and so on, there are massively lower costs which are going to threaten the
standard of living of everyone else in Europe and increase pressures on
structural unemployment.'
Here, too, Unilever finds itself on both sides of the argument. It would
like more freedom to export to the west from the low-cost plants in central
Europe. 'If we don't, our competitors will, and our shareholders won't thank
us for putting them at a disadvantage,' Perry says. Yet the group also has a
huge stake in western Europe, where it makes more than half its sales and
employs more than 100,000 people.
If things were left to the laws of supply and demand, labour costs in the EU
would plunge, he says. 'But since we all want passionately to cling to gains
in our standard of living, we shall do everything possible to prevent that.
But something has got to give somewhere. In the past, the gap (in labour
costs) was plugged by tariffs and protection. The dismantling of protection
has to lead to another solution.'
What might that be? Ideally, Perry says, the gap would be closed by a rise
in living standards in the developing world. The differential could also be
narrowed by a reduction in social charges in western Europe, which would
lower labour costs without eating too deeply into take-home pay.
He is encouraged by the realistic tone of the recent white paper on
competitiveness by Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission. But
he is far less sanguine about reducing long-term unemployment, which he
considers the biggest threat to the world economy. 'There is little
companies can do on their own. We will generate wealth by using every ounce
of innovation and technology . . .to make products and services. But we are
able to generate a unit of wealth these days with lower labour content than
we were. Therein lies the dilemma. Where that takes us, I'm not sure. But it
is an area where the old, easy, answers no longer apply.'
With so much on its plate, he reckons, the EU needs to adjust to the impact
of the Uruguay Round before it is ready to launch any further big
initiatives in foreign economic policy. 'We now have to let the thing
settle, let the patterns become clearer. It may lead to some recoil, some
back-tracking.'
But any period of reflection and consolidation is likely to be kept short by
the rush of events elsewhere - above all by political change and uncertainty
in the former Soviet Union and China.
'The threats to stability in Europe and the world are self-evident. To that
extent, the arrangements put in place in the Uruguay Round, which appeared
to fit the context of economic and geopolitical structures as they were
yesterday, will have to be looked at again when patterns change. I can't put
it any more precisely than that.'

FT  10 JAN 94 / People: Yet more turbulence at TWA
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Carl Icahn resigned as chairman of Trans World Airlines a year ago, the
US carrier appeared to have embarked on a period of relative harmony, writes
Frank McGurty. Just this autumn, TWA emerged from two years of Chapter 11
protection, with William Howard, a much-admired industry veteran, at the
controls.
Last week, Howard, 71, resigned, ending a short and not-so-sweet chapter in
TWA's tangled tale.
His replacement is Donald Craib, 68, a former chairman and chief executive
of the Allstate Insurance Group. A TWA director for two months, Craib has no
experience of operating an airline.
He spent 36 years at Allstate, then a subsidiary of Sears Roebuck, starting
in 1950 as a claim adjuster, and has been a management consultant since
retiring in 1986.
Sporting a brave face and a tight lip, the TWA board said Craib's background
reflected broad financial and administrative experience. Moreover, he
supported 'employee involvement in the corporate decision-making process',
an important issue at a company of which the staff owns 45 per cent.
Under Icahn, morale had taken a nose-dive. In announcing his resignation,
the board praised the grandfatherly Howard for helping revive the enthusiasm
of TWA's employees.
He was reported to have clashed over strategy with Glenn Zander, 47, one of
his two vice-chairman. In an ironic twist, Zander, a career TWA financial
executive, also departed last week, citing personal reasons.
The acrimony between the two surfaced soon after it became apparent the
airline's position remained highly precarious.
In November, it announced a third-quarter loss of Dollars 61.7m and analysts
have questioned whether TWA's current cash reserve of Dollars 163m is
adequate to see it through the lean winter months.
Not surprisingly Craib is more upbeat. In fact, he plans to expand the
airline's capacity over the next year - one of the pillars of Howard's
strategy to distinguish TWA as a full-service carrier.

FT  10 JAN 94 / People: Boonstra bows out of Sara Lee
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The onset of Chicago's winter may have been too much for Cornelis Boonstra,
Sara Lee's president and chief operating officer who retired abruptly on
December 31 after only six months in the job, writes Laurie Morse.
The 56-year-old Dutchman cited personal reasons for his departure, which led
local pundits to speculate that his wife may have preferred to stay at home
in the Bahamas rather than circulate in Chicago's frigid climate and
midwestern social set. Through a spokeswoman, Boonstra said his departure
was not based on differences with company management, and was not linked to
health considerations.
His exit shocked analysts, who said Boonstra had just reorganised Sara Lee's
lagging apparel business. Sara Lee, which had Dollars 14.6bn in sales in
1993, is best known for its bakery, coffee and grocery lines, but is also a
global marketer of personal care products and clothing brands like Hanes,
L'eggs, Bali, Playtex and Champion.
Boonstra, a 20-year Sara Lee veteran, was heir-apparent to company chairman
and ceo John Bryan. Before being appointed president in July, Boonstra had
served as chief of Sara Lee's European operations. He had been an executive
vice president and director at Sara Lee since 1988.
Boonstra also resigned his seat on Sara Lee's board, although he will be
elected as a member of the supervisory board of Sara Lee/DE, a Dutch entity
which oversees most of the company's international business.
Bryan, 58, is in no hurry to retire, but now that Boonstra has bowed out his
succession is left to a troika of executives. Though Boonstra's duties have
been split between Steven McMillan, executive vice president, and Donald
Franceschini, senior vice president, Michael Murphy, the chief financial
officer since August, has also been suggested as a successor.

FT  10 JAN 94 / People: Jardine's Scottish tradition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE LUCAS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When one of Hong Kong's most prestigious jobs is vacated in March - taipan
of Jardine Matheson, the colony's oldest hong - it will be taken up by
Alasdair Morrison, 45-year-old managing director of its associate, Hongkong
Land Property Company, writes Louise Lucas.
While other hongs have done their bit by replacing top-level departees with
local Hong Kong Chinese, Jardine is keeping up the older tradition of having
a Scotsman at the helm.
At a Christmas function, Nigel Rich, the present taipan who leaves the
colony in March to become group chief executive at Trafalgar House, and
Morrison, both Scots, were resplendent in kilts.
It may be fitting attire for the managing director of Jardine Matheson,
which has a thistle as its emblem, but Morrison may find he has more need to
reach for his skean dhu in the challenges ahead.
To the Chinese government, Jardine compounded its original sin - the group
started life as an opium merchant - by distancing itself from the colony.
The group was the first to re-domicile in Bermuda and to switch its primary
listing to London.
Finally, it publicly supported the democracy proposals put forward by Chris
Patten, governor of Hong Kong and architect of the blueprint for an expanded
democracy ahead of 1997. Beijing could stand no more; it told the hong to
gui xi (literally go west, but also go to hell) and then gloated as the
group's share prices took a hammering.
When it comes to facing these and other issues, analysts and peers say
Morrison is capable, sure-footed, an obvious heir to the throne. His
ultra-conservative style is just the ticket for acting guardian of a holding
company tightly controlled from London by Messrs Henry and Simon Keswick,
the controlling shareholders.

FT  10 JAN 94 / Business Travel: When tickets crumble to dust - FT Writers
explain the rights of passengers who find their flights overbooked or
seriously delayed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Laden with your suitcase, briefcase and suit-carrier, you stagger to the
airline check-in desk. All you want is to relax in your business-class seat
with a glass of champagne, and a flight attendant tending to your needs.
Instead you hear: 'I'm sorry, sir, the flight is overbooked. You'll have to
wait.' Your confirmed ticket crumbles to dust. Angry and frustrated, you
wonder what will happen next.
Most airlines in large business destinations try to soothe you with cash,
meal vouchers and free telephone calls to your destination. They have to do
this under European Union or US rules, which set out minimum, and in the US
case, maximum cash compensation for 'bumped' passengers.
In the EU, for flights of up to 3,500km (mainly within Europe and north
Africa) compensation should be at least Ecu75 (Pounds 59) where the airline
offers an alternative flight arriving within two hours of the original time,
and Ecu150 for flights arriving over two hours later.
On longer flights, Ecu150 should be paid for flights arriving within four
hours of the original time, and Ecu300 where the delay is more than four
hours.
In the US, the figures are 'an amount equal to the one-way fare up to a
maximum of Dollars 200' for delays of between one and two hours (two and
four hours for international flights) and twice the fare up to Dollars 400
if the delay is longer.
The US Department of Transportation points out that 'you always get to keep
your original ticket, and you can use it on another flight or have it
refunded. The . . . compensation is essentially a payment for your
inconvenience.'
Many airlines prefer to offer flight vouchers instead of cash as
compensation. Vouchers give discounts on flights, generally of Dollars
300-Dollars 500, but you should ensure that they can be used on discounted,
as well as full-fare, tickets. You can insist on a cash payment.
Some airlines, especially those in the US, operate auctions, in which they
offer progressively higher amounts of compensation until the excess number
of passengers has voluntarily agreed to take a later flight. United
Airlines, the second biggest carrier in the US, says that this system means
that only one in 30,000 passengers is bumped off a flight against his or her
will.
Flights originating outside the US or EU may be less straightforward. Some
carriers, such as American Airlines, Swissair and Japan Air Lines, apply US
or EU rules across their entire network. Others, especially carriers from
developing countries, may try to pay substantially less.
The rules do not apply to charter flights.
For all passengers, a few steps can be taken to minimise the chances of
losing your seat:
Confirm your flight, and check in on time. These are prerequisites for the
US and EU compensation rules to take effect. Checking in early will reduce
the risk still further.
Travel business class, first class or on a full-fare economy ticket. Most
airlines claim they never overbook the first-class cabin, and if you are on
a full-fare economy ticket you should be first in line to be bumped into
business or first class. Furthermore, with a first or business-class ticket,
other airlines on the route will be keen to take you on their flights,
because they then get the ticket revenue.
Join frequent flyer or other privilege programmes. All the airlines
contacted by the Financial Times said that holders of such cards should be
less likely to be bumped.
Kick up a fuss. Ground staff have a lot of discretion over who flies. If you
have a business meeting, anniversary dinner or medical condition, tell the
ground staff.
Persistence works: one terrier-like FT journalist was bumped on to Concorde
as ground staff strove to rid themselves of his attentions.

FT  10 JAN 94 / Management: Lament of the big spenders - Purchasing and
supply are still not getting the attention they deserve. Michael Cassell
investigates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Clive Mason spends more than Pounds 6m a day every day of the year. Stuart
Humby signs off a similar amount. Peter Garnett daily waves goodbye to the
best part of Pounds 1m.
Drawn from the highest ranks of the UK's 120,000-strong army of purchasing
and supply managers who annually write Pounds 750bn worth of cheques between
them, they are among the biggest of big spenders.
If people like them spend wisely, they can help boost both their companies'
short-term profitability and their long-term competitiveness.
Mason, director of purchasing and supply for British Airways, heads a
worldwide team which buys everything from jet fuel to champagne. Humby,
director of group purchasing for National Westminster Bank, buys cars by the
dozen for the bank's 11,500-strong fleet. Garnett is managing director of
Greenalls Services, the company formed specifically to buy in everything
from beer mats to beds for the shops, pubs and hotels within the Greenalls
group.
The benefits of professional procurement can be enjoyed by companies of all
sizes. The recently-formed purchasing team at Bankers Trust, the
international investment bank, reckons it has saved the business Pounds 12m
in three years; Airoil-Flaregas, a Middlesex-based combustion equipment
maker with annual turnover of Pounds 20m, says that improved buying
procedures are saving it a useful Pounds 15,000 a month.
Companies spend an average 55 per cent of total production costs on buying
in goods and, increasingly, on a range of support services. But despite a
growing awareness of the value of a strategic approach to the purchasing and
supply function - now invariably dubbed 'logistics' - the impression remains
that most British companies still fail to take the issue seriously enough.
The result, according to the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply,
means unenlightened businesses could be spending up to one-third more than
necessary and ultimately risking their own future.
It also means that those charged with the purchasing role have been widely
regarded as bit-players in the corporate management game, badly paid when
compared to finance or marketing personnel and rarely promoted into general
management.
A recent survey carried out among more than 400 UK companies by the CIPS
offers an 'alarming snapshot' of current attitudes. Nearly one quarter of
companies do not believe they can make any savings by improving purchasing
and supply practice, while 17 per cent cannot even identify the percentage
of their total costs spent on buying goods and services.
'Despite high levels of external expenditure, most companies are still in
the stone age as far as managing the purchase and supply chain is
concerned,' says Peter Thomson, CIPS director general.
The CIPS, naturally enough, wants the issue driven much higher up the
management agenda until the supply chain is widely acknowledged as an
important influence in the overall performance of a business.
Mason, Humby and Garnett all agree that part of the answer lies in ending
the compartmentalised nature of a job in which barriers are too often placed
between those who sign the bills and those with purchasing expertise.
Instead, they advocate a broader, strategic approach which embraces the
entire company.
The three agree that the process of elevating the supply chain process
should ideally start with its endorsement among the highest tiers of
management, with overall responsibility for the issue held by someone at or
near board level.
'It is about establishing a new mind-set,' says Mason. 'You can begin by
asking very senior people if they know how much their company spends, how
many suppliers they have, the average length of contracts. You are often met
with a glazed look but you might provoke them to go and find out.'
Garnett says that by setting up a separate company to handle procurement for
Greenalls, the group has made transparent the entire supply chain process,
enabling it to analyse its efficiency and financial performance.
'At the end of the process, you can choose whether or not to contract out
all or part of the entire supply chain, from warehousing and distribution to
finance and technical services,' he says.
Mason comments that one of the biggest challenges is 'getting people to
shift thinking from price to cost. When you start considering whole-life
costs instead of concentrating on knocking a few pounds off the initial
deal, you are making progress. When we buy an aircraft, one of the elements
built in is what we can sell it for 15 years later.'
He adds: 'In the mid-1980s, we had 10,000 significant suppliers in the world
 -now the figure is down to 3,500 and still falling. There is a different
focus. People used to chase new suppliers to extract better prices but now
the focus is on who can deliver what we really need.'
Humby refers to partnership sourcing - the building of a long-term
relationship between supplier and customer - and suggests: 'A more strategic
approach to purchasing means it can be involved right at the start of the
specification process so that suppliers can respond differently to meet a
company's specific needs. That way you can make important step-changes to
productivity.
'All too often, companies take a look at the purchasing operation and then
forget it. There is a black hole in understanding. But it needs to be
examined systematically, comprehensively and relentlessly,' he says.
The CIPS is doing its bit to raise the profile of purchasing in the business
education world, by sponsoring three university chairs and planning as many
as 12 over the next five years. It is also building links with business
schools in the US and the UK.
Mason says that, despite the disappointing attitude towards purchasing and
supply, business is at least starting to catch on. British Airways this year
had more than 1,000 applications for six graduate places in its purchasing
group.
Greenall says: 'The function has not been seen as a route to the top - but
that is going to change. To be effective in this area you need a breadth of
business understanding which crosses all areas of the company. It will
become a new breeding ground for successful executives.'
Meanwhile, the CIPS prefers to keep its feet on the ground. 'Our survey
findings are truly astonishing because of the sheer ineptitude, the sheer
lack of business acumen they reveal,' says Peter Thomson. 'Not to know how
much is spent and how much can be saved says very little for the businessmen
concerned.'

FT  10 JAN 94 / Business Travel: Long day's journey - FT Writers explain the
rights of passengers who find their flights overbooked or seriously delayed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is a struggle to crawl out of bed at 6am in the dead of winter, but that
is the price one pays for being a north Londoner with a flight leaving
Heathrow at 9.30.
The Northern and Piccadilly Underground lines delivered me to Terminal 1 at
8.30am on December 28. There I was greeted by a notice saying that my Cyprus
Airways flight to Larnaca had been delayed until 6 that evening because of a
24-hour strike by Cypriot civil servants.
What rights do you have if your flight is delayed? Not many, as I
discovered. Rebecca Evans, a barrister in the legal department of the
Consumers' Association, says delays are a 'grey and fuzzy area'. The best
strategy is to scream and shout, which often results in offers of
compensation.
Cyprus Airways check-in is handled at Heathrow by British Airways. The BA
staff were helpful, walking along the check-in queues to warn passengers for
Larnaca that they should not wait, as their luggage would not be accepted
before 3pm. All further inquiries were directed to the Cyprus Airways
airport staff.
Cyprus Airways agreed to send a fax to my hotel in Nicosia to say I would be
arriving after midnight, but that was all. All further requests for help
received a belligerent response, as did inquiries to the airline's London
office after I returned home.
The airline's staff at Heathrow said they would not feed customers who had
to spend the day at the airport. There were no cups of tea on offer and
certainly no sympathy.
The strike, the airline employees said, had nothing to do with them. The
delay had been caused by government employees, including customs and
immigration officials and air traffic controllers.
But wasn't the airline owned by the Cyprus government, the internationally
recognised administration that controls the southern, Greek side of the
island? Not really, the airline's London office said. The Cyprus government
owned a minority 49 per cent stake. The remaining 51 per cent was held by
private investors.
As the strike had started the night before, why hadn't the airline attempted
to contact passengers to warn them of the delay? The airline said its London
staff had not known about the strike until the morning after it started,
suggesting that communication between Cyprus and London is not all it should
be. Although it is true that the strike was called at short notice, BA had
already postponed a flight the night before because of the dispute.
Cyprus Airways' London office said most passengers on the flight lived
within commuting distance of the airport and could go home. It added that BA
had sent its own passengers home. If any passengers were out of pocket, they
should contact the airline.
BA confirmed that it had sent passengers home. It said it had no hard and
fast rule on how to deal with delays. It said customer service staff were
encouraged to take responsibility for passengers and keep them comfortable.
Ms Evans says the Warsaw Convention, which governs airline behaviour, has
more to say about delayed baggage than delayed passengers. Airlines are
obliged to compensate you if they do not get you to your destination within
a reasonable time - usually six hours for a long-haul flight.
But Cyprus Airways was within its rights: if a delay is caused by events
outside an airline's control, you have no right to compensation. But, she
adds: 'It's not unknown that if people make a fuss they do get
compensation.'

FT  10 JAN 94 / Management: Put the gender issue on the agenda - Steve
Shirley, life-president of the FI Group, on how to get more women into
senior positions - Tips from the top
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE SHIRLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Let's suppose that one of your resolutions for 1994 is to get more women
into senior management, perhaps even on to the board. What do you have to do
this Monday morning?
With women forming more than half the working population, it certainly seems
strange that so few of us get through the glass ceiling to serve at a
corporate level. It should be no surprise if shareholders start asking
questions at the AGM.
The point is, however, that it is quality not quantity that counts: pressure
to play the numbers game does not help. Making promotions and new
appointments is tough enough without someone saying you should appoint a
black or someone with disabilities or, heaven forbid, a woman.
Yet some positive discrimination may be necessary, if for no other reason
than to create the right corporate culture. My experience is that once you
alter the culture, there is no looking back.
Women have seen welcome changes in the fields of marketing and advertising,
and more recently, in the old, hidebound professions of law and accountancy.
But we also need such a quantum leap in industry.
Top women now aged over 50 can be termed pioneers. We were the first of the
few rising to uncharted territory. Career opportunities 30 years ago were so
narrow that we had to take any significant opportunities that arose. The
same is true today. I receive more corporate invitations than my business
performance alone would warrant. They have an element of tokenism.
No matter - provided it is clearly understood that I am not going to sit
quietly, giggling at the occasional joke whether or not I understand it. I
expect to be judged by the same inexorable criteria as my male colleagues:
do I enable my group or organisation to achieve its task? Nowadays that is
less by command and control, more by building teamwork and empowering
individuals.
There are undoubted business benefits in having a work environment that is
more encouraging to women. So, in the absence of quotas, what can be done to
increase the quality and quantity of women's participation?
First, companies should consider introducing general management training
specifically for women. I'm also a great believer in senior managers, of
either sex, mentoring more junior female colleagues. Then, there is 'career
pathing' as a system of stepped experience towards career goals. Like men,
women have to face the issue of whether they are prepared to pay the price
of a vigorous career. Success is not an easy option. It requires sacrifices
but also provides excitement and a sense of fulfilment.
Funnily enough, I also believe that God is in the detail. We have to get job
advertisements and application forms worded so that women who have been
through career breaks to have children or to follow a husband's job move, do
not feel they have to break into an alien world of steady progression and
unbroken continuity.
If you want to get a woman on your board as a non-executive, think of the
characteristics you want in any director. Then if there is a shortage in
your industry extend your search to professions where women have hit the
top.
Perceptions are vitally important. I shall always remember rejecting a
candidate's application on the grounds of her insufficient experience. Then
a headhunter so extolled her entrepreneurial qualities and trained intellect
that a meeting was arranged. She went on to serve on our board for more than
two terms.
On the subject of positive discrimination, there is Opportunity 2000's idea
of percentages agreed with business unit heads so as to target, say, 30 per
cent of all department heads or unit leaders to women. Once the middle
management posts are filled, there will be competences enough for the top
posts later. The main reason people give me for not appointing women to
their boards is that there are no women around. By this they usually mean
visible at the level below the board.
The process of managing change is an enormous challenge. But it is not
always necessary to guess. Ask the women in your organisation what they
think will help them fulfil their aspirations.

The US travel industry, hard hit by public reaction to crimes against
foreign tourists, last week launched a campaign to promote the safety of
travel to the US. It will involve more information for travellers and
lobbying for stricter gun control laws.

FT  10 JAN 94 / Business Travel (Travel Update): Discount time
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Some US airlines cut fares by as much as 45 per cent last week. The cuts
were triggered by Northwest Airlines, which reduced prices on flights in the
US, Canada and the Caribbean between January 18 and April 15. American
Airlines, United, US Air, TWA, Continental and Delta, all followed, but did
not cut prices in all regions. Discounting among US airlines is common in
January but rarely on this scale.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The planned opening of the Channel Tunnel next May has sparked the expected
price cutting by ferry operators. Eurotunnel, the tunnel operator, will
announce its fares on Tuesday. They are likely to range between Pounds 160
and Pounds 260, depending on the season. Last week Stena Sealink simplified
and cut its charges. A standard round trip for a car and five passengers
will start at Pounds 126, rising to a peak of Pounds 220, with extra charges
for weekend sailings. The previous peak price was Pounds 294, Stena said.

FT  10 JAN 94 / Business Travel (Travel Update): Favourite among the safest
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
British Airways claims to be the world's favourite airline, but which is the
safest?
The International Airline Passengers Association has spent six months
developing a system for evaluating airline safety. It looked at how many
accidents airlines had suffered and how many deaths per million passengers.
It also looked at other, less quantifiable, factors. These included aircraft
maintenance and the quality of pilot training, the age of aircraft and the
air traffic infrastructure in an airline's base country.
BA is among the six safest large airlines. The association said BA had only
one accident in its last 3m flights and had 'an excellent management'.
But top of the list of safe large airlines was American. 'Every American
flight sets another world record for most flights without an accident, now
over 9m,' the association said. 'No other airline . . . has been close to
this record.'
The association believes American's success lies in its innovative pilot
training and the right it gives to all mechanics to ground an aircraft.
The other large carriers with good safety records are SAS ('accident free
for over 24 years, an unbelievable number'), Delta, Lufthansa and Southwest.
The best of the medium-sized airlines were All Nippon, America West, Ansett
Australia, Canadian Airlines International and Saudi Arabian Airlines.

FT  10 JAN 94 / FT/Transmedia Restaurant Promotion: There is such a thing as
a free lunch - How to obtain 25 per cent off a meal out and win a free
dinner
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More than 2,500 restaurants in the UK and the US are taking part in the 1994
Financial Times restaurant promotion. FT readers will be entitled to a 25
per cent saving on food and drinks consumed at lunch and dinner for a full
six months. All take part between January 24 and February 11 will be entered
in a draw for 1,000 free lunches (or dinners) for two offered to launch the
scheme.
This follows last January's successful two-week restaurant promotion, Lunch
for a Fiver, which offered fun and unbeatable value in the UK.
This year we offer a deal on an international scale that will last longer.
The key to the Financial Times 1994 restaurant offer is the Financial
Times/Transmedia restaurant charge card. You can apply for it, free of
charge, by writing to the address on the application form at the bottom of
this page. After that, all you require is a valid Access, Visa or Delta
charge card and a first class stamp.
Once you have sent this information off you will receive a live
FT/Transmedia restaurant charge card which you can use in any restaurant
that accepts the Transmedia card as you would any other credit card. You
will also receive the Transmedia directory of 2,400 US restaurants which
accept the card plus a listing of the British restaurants. As the number of
British restaurants which accepts this card is growing quickly we will be
providing updates of the participating restaurants on the food and drink
page of the Weekend FT.
What are the benefits for the FT reader?
The most obvious is the 25 per cent saving on food and beverages (excluding
service and vat) to which the card entitles you. This saving applies to all
the restaurants taking part whenever they are open for business.
But there is more. The attraction of this particular offer is the scope and
number of the participating restaurants. If you live in London you may well
be able to use it daily - for business entertaining or meals with friends or
family. If you live outside London, and there is currently no Transmedia
restaurant nearby, you can still apply for the card and use it when
travelling.
This also applies to FT readers living outside Britain. You can apply for an
FT/Transmedia card and use it when business or pleasure brings you to
London, Edinburgh, Bath or Bristol. Or to the US when a business or holiday
trip takes you to New York, Washington, Chicago, San Francisco or Los
Angeles. Transmedia is also planning to open a Paris office later this year.
How does it work?
For readers of most newspapers such an extraordinary offer would need no
further explanation but FT readers will doubtless be curious about its
mechanics.
Transmedia advances unsecured cash to a restaurant which it then markets to
Transmedia cardmembers. The advance is repaid on a 2 for 1 basis via the
food and beverage credits which Transmedia card members consume at these
restaurants. To encourage its members to use these restaurants more
frequently Transmedia passes on a 25 per cent saving on food and beverage
back to the card member via his or her Access, Visa or Delta card.
Since it was established in 1984 Transmedia estimates that it has advanced
more than Dollars 130m to the American restaurant industry and, during the
same period, made total savings of around Dollars 28m for its card members.
What makes Transmedia attractive to so many restaurateurs is that it has
found a niche in the market, filled it and then adapted itself to keep its
restaurants busy.
A restaurateur can put the unsecured cash to whatever use he or she chooses.
Banks have never understood the restaurant industry, sometimes with good
reason, but often because restaurateurs offer little in the way of security.
A lease is normally a restaurant's main asset and, frequently, the terms of
a lease can preclude a change of use if the restaurant fails.
None of the restaurants which join Transmedia are working with such large
margins that they can afford to reduce their prices for ever. But each has a
different commercial need and can see a positive use for an interest-free
advance: to repay a bank overdraft or directors' loans or to redecorate or
re-equip and improve service. The managing director of one highly popular
wine bar has joined because, after 14 years of packed houses, she feels the
building needs a bit of a facelift and Transmedia can provide the necessary
capital.
Transmedia takes the risk of advancing cash to the restaurant industry and
minimises this risk by marketing and promoting the restaurants. During the
late 1980s many US restaurants joined Transmedia as the recession affected
demand and high interest rates made bank borrowing to finance promotion or
publicity unthinkable. But, as the US economy improves, there has been no
slacking in the call for Transmedia's services.
The reason for this is something that is now being learnt and applied by
British restaurateurs. The high prices of the 1980s have disappeared and we
are all demanding value for money whether it is business or social
entertaining.
This means lower prices. To compensate for this, and rising overheads,
restaurants are opening longer and later. The most costly item today is not
an extra waitress but an empty table.
One restaurateur, who plans to open a large brasserie later this year in
London's West End, estimates that to break even his turnover will have to be
at least Pounds 2.5m - and that is before the builders have left the site.
A number of restaurateurs have successfully been able to keep their
restaurants busy enough to make them profitable and Ed Guinan, Transmedia's
European chairman, is aware that Transmedia may not be for every
restaurateur.
But for those keen to increase volume and turnover - and the British
restaurateurs who have already joined Transmedia will soon have the benefit
of increased business from visiting US cardmembers - Transmedia may provide
an effective solution.
As Seth Lewis, food and beverage manager at the Grosvenor House, on Park
Lane, central London explained: 'Business is considerably better than it was
a year ago but it is still only good 40 weeks a year.
'My job now is to make it good 52 weeks a year.' Two of his hotel's
restaurants now accept the Transmedia card.
How do you take advantage of the FT/Transmedia card?
The key to where you can use your card and the secret behind Transmedia's
success in marketing and promoting its member restaurants lies in the
compact Transmedia Directory of Restaurants which is mailed to all its card
members every six weeks.
If you wish to keep the card after six months you will be charged an annual
card fee of Pounds 35. This fee will be refunded if you wish to cancel your
membership of the scheme during the first year.
1,000 free meals draw.
To enter the 1,000 free meals draw use your FT/Transmedia Restaurant card at
any of the participating restaurants in the UK from Monday January 24 to
Friday February 11. You will be automatically entered in the draw (there are
no alternatives to the prizes offered). The more you use your card the
better your chance of winning]
To encourage readers who enjoy commenting on restaurants the FT will be
offering 200 Winesavers, for storing wine leftovers, to readers who send the
bestaccounts of their meal. We will also send a case of pink Champagne to
the outright winner. Send your stories to me at the FT. Rate restaurants
from A-C (A= excellent, C= poor) for 1)Service, 2) Food quality, 3)Value for
money 4)Atmosphere.
Promoters are: Financial Times, Number One, Southwark Bridge, London SE1 9HL
and Transmedia, 11 St James's Square London SW1Y 4AD.

FT  10 JAN 94 / FT/Transmedia Restaurant Promotion: Financial Times special
offer - Terms and conditions
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The FT/Transmedia Restaurant Promotion entitles readers to apply for an
FT/Transmedia Restaurant Card free for the first six months. Annual
membership fees are Pounds 35 and will be billed to your credit card account
at the end of the fee-waived period.
Card holders may cancel membership at any time for a full refund on return
of the FT/Transmedia Restaurant Card. To participate in the promotion,
readers must have a Visa, Mastercard, or Delta credit card.
The FT/Transmedia Restaurant Card entitles holders to a 25 per cent saving
on the cost of the food and beverage portion of restaurant bills (not
including VAT, service and tip) at participating restaurants.)
Reservations for parties of seven or more must be booked through the
Transmedia office. Reservations are subject to space available. The
telephone number for reservations is 071-930-0700.
To use your FT/Transmedia Restaurant Card select a participating restaurant
from the list published in the FT.
Present your card at the end of the meal as you would any other major credit
card, sign the Transmedia slip for the full amount and keep your copy.
Transmedia, not the restaurant, gives the 25 per cent saving and therefore
the 25 % saving that will not be deducted at the restaurant but will appear
on your Visa, Mastercard or Delta statement.
Transmedia will charge your Visa, Mastercard or Delta account for the full
amount of the Transmedia charge slip and will process a corresponding
transaction crediting your account for the 25 per cent discount on the food
and beverage portion of the slip.
Continue to check the published list of restaurants as some restaurants may
be added or deleted. Restaurant directories will be sent to cardholders
updating participating restaurants after the initial promotion has ended.
Only the application form printed in the FT is valid. Photocopies or any
other reproductions will not be accepted. Closing date for receipt of
applications for the launch promotion is Friday, January 21 1994.
Applications should be sent to FT/Transmedia Restaurant offer, PO Box 85,
Watford, WD2 4WQ.
Cards are expected to be sent within 7 days of application receipt.
Transmedia will continue to accept card applications after the initial
closing date, but cannot guarantee delivery in time for the launch
promotion.
Following the end of the FT/Transmedia Restaurant Promotion, a
computer-generated random selection will be made of 1000 Transmedia
restaurant charge slips generated over the promotion period of Monday
January 24 to Friday February 11 1994. Charge slips selected entitle each
winner to receive a Pounds 50 Transmedia credit toward their next visit to
any Transmedia restaurant while continuing to enjoy a 25 per cent discount
with their Transmedia card. The selection will take place on Tuesday, March
1 1994. Winners will be notified as soon as possible after Monday March 7.
The Financial Times and Transmedia cannot be responsible for lost or stolen
cards, although Transmedia will make every effort to recover these cards.
Transmedia will provide restaurants with an updated list of invalid cards.
The card holder should inform Transmedia as soon as possible to expedite
this procedure.

FT  10 JAN 94 / Neo-Tesco look services motorways
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL JOHNSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Turn left after the Burger King, pass the amusement arcade and you will
reach the Country Kitchen restaurant, complete with patisserie, salad bar,
and hot servery.
Not your local high street, but Granada's Chieveley service station near
Newbury, Berkshire, built in 1987 on a 50-mile stretch of the M4 between the
Heston and Membury service stations that had no toilets, food or fuel.
All the signs are that it will be the model for the new service stations
promised last week. Granada - which with Forte's Welcome Break dominates the
53-station market with a score each - sees de-regulation as an opportunity
to establish a brand identity, not to revolutionise the service-station
concept.
Mr Ian Dunstall, the commercial director of Granada Hospitality, said:
'Historically there has been no branding between operators, with people
defining a station by location rather than operator.'
The most sensitive motorists will be disappointed to hear that the
prevailing 'neo-Tesco' style of station is unlikely to be overtaken by
anything more elegant this decade. Granada plans to standardise its stations
over the next few years so that visitors will hardly tell the difference
between stops on the M25 and one on the M1.
It will build three stations in the next three years, costing some Pounds
20m each. Meanwhile, it is installing a Burger King on every site and
spending Pounds 10m on converting the interiors of its oldest developments.
'Criticism tends to be directed at the ambience internally,' Mr Dunstall
said. 'People will be able to find their way round as easily as their local
Sainsbury's'
Forte points out that the government has protected against an explosion of
fast-food outlets along motorways by insisting that operators continue to
provide 24-hour access, fuel, free parking and toilets.
Mr Richard Power, head of corporate communications at Forte, said: 'The
experienced operators will open a number of new outlets, but they are likely
to be smaller than those built under the old system.'
He predicts an increase in the provision of facilities so that outlets will
be 'as much a place to relax as to eat'. Beyond that, Forte says its new
Welcome Break developments will not be much different from existing ones.
Smaller, more frequent service stations thus appear to be the way forward.
But greater competition seems unlikely to attract significant new entrants.
Accor, the French leisure group, recently showed some interest in a site on
the M25. It has withdrawn, however, worried that the prime sites had already
been snapped up. It was also put off by the requirement to provide fuel as
well as catering facilities on site.
The 24 new service stations - four with planning permission - which are now
in the pipeline are the product of de-regulation. Until now, stations had to
be spaced at least 30 miles apart.
The government has given the private sector responsibility for picking
sites, acquiring the land and seeking planning permission. Some are worried
about the still-unwieldy nature of the planning process. Mr Peter Dixon, of
consultants Grimley JR Eve's motorway and roadside development team, said:
'Motorway service area de-regulation was announced 16 months ago. It's a bit
rich to boast that four have obtained planning permission after so long.'

FT  10 JAN 94 / Tecs under fire for 'basic deficiencies'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Training and Enterprise Councils, set up by the government to spearhead
training improvements and stimulate local economies, will drift into a
secondary role unless reforms are made, says a study led by Professor Robert
Bennett of the London School of Economics, published today.
It is the first significant independent examination of the 82 employer-led
Tecs and their Scottish equivalents, Local Enterprise Companies.
Tecs, and to a lesser extent Lecs, are criticised on a number of fronts
including widely differing financial management.
The National Audit Office is looking at the effectiveness of the Department
of Employment's action to improve Tecs' financial control systems.
Tecs are also criticised in the LSE report for a lack of skilled staff. Many
staff are civil servants on secondment and the study recommends an immediate
end to this practice, which is not due to finish until 1996.
It also identifies 'fundamental deficiencies in the structure of Tecs'. The
study says the government has given the councils an unclear job. The
original mission for Tecs was to foster local economic growth and strengthen
the UK's skills base.
Yet most of the government's finance for Tecs is earmarked for training the
unemployed. Tecs play only a small part in local economic development, and
have few opportunities to become more involved.
Others recommendations made by Prof Bennett, including the suggestion that
Tecs could merge with chambers of commerce, are likely to be controversial.
Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, and Mr David Hunt,
the employment secretary, are to decide shortly whether they will approve
such moves.
Several Tecs would like to merge with chambers while others are strongly
opposed.
The proposal that the new combined Tecs and chambers should be more
independent of the government, and that they should be able to receive a
levy from the non-domestic rate, is likely to be politically unacceptable.
Prof Bennett, who believes chambers of commerce have more legitimacy because
of their local business membership and the democratic election of their
councils, is an advocate of Continental-style chambers. These have
substantial regulatory relationships with local employers.
He said yesterday: 'The government has not given Tecs the means to achieve
the grand vision.'
Mr Edward Roberts, chairman of the Tec National Council, said: 'There are no
quick fixes. Tecs have been set up over the past three years. We need a
serious sustained effort over the next decade. Some of the issues raised by
the study are being dealt with.'

FT  10 JAN 94 / ITV merger plans worry advertisers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Advertisers have protested to fair trading and television regulators about
concentration of TV advertising sales that will take place after proposed
mergers in the industry.
The Office of Fair Trading last week extended its investigation into
Granada's Pounds 700m bid for London Weekend Television and is believed to
be looking at concerns expressed by the Incorporated Society of British
Advertisers.
The society has told the OFT and the Independent Television Commission that
sales houses may have too much power.
Laser, the LWT sales house, also sells for Yorkshire-Tyne Tees, in which
Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a stake. The Time Exchange, the
Granada sales house, is a joint venture with Scottish and also sells for
Grampian and Border.
The two sales houses have more than 40 per cent of the ITV advertising
market.

FT  10 JAN 94 / More adults attempt to slim
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A third of adults in the UK are trying to slim at any one time, Mintel, the
market intelligence group, says today. Ten years ago the proportion was only
a quarter.
The slimming foods market, which Mintel calculates was worth Pounds 67m in
1993, traditionally receives a boost in January following the excesses of
Christmas.
Mintel highlights concerns that while some of those dieting have no medical
need to slim, others who are overweight are doing nothing to shed their
excess pounds.
Women are more likely to be dieting unnecessarily and men to be avoiding
slimming. Government research suggests that 37 per cent of men are
overweight, compared with 24 per cent of women, says the study. Yet Mintel
analyst Ms Helen Ruddick said that a survey of more than 25,000 adults for
the report showed that nearly 41 per cent of women, compared with 23 per
cent of men, said they were trying to slim.
Sales of slimming foods reached a new high last year, following a slump at
the beginning of the decade when the sector's value plummeted to about
Pounds 25m. The decline was caused mainly by the demise of very low-calorie
diets of drinks, soups and bars that were intended to take the place
entirely of normal eating.
These extreme diets have been superseded by 'meal replacements' which are
designed as alternatives to some main meals but not as the sole source of
nutrition, says Mintel.
The report forecasts further growth in the sector during the next four
years, partly because of demographic changes - the number of women aged from
25 to 54 is expected to increase by 4 per cent during the period. Yet some
restrictions are expected in the advertising of slimming products as a
result of European Union legislation.
Mintel also warns manufacturers that 'dieters are notoriously fickle' and
that many who regain lost weight 'may give up on products they have tried
before, and will continue to look for new ways to get slim - the next
miracle cure'.

FT  10 JAN 94 / Boundary changes may remove familiar faces from Commons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Several prominent MPs may find themselves defending marginal seats at the
next general election if proposals to redraw their constituency boundaries
are implemented this year.
Party managers say that four government members - Mr Nicholas Soames, the
food minister, Sir George Young, the housing minister, Sir John Wheeler,
Northern Ireland minister, and Sir Derek Spencer, the solicitor-general -
will find that, on the basis of votes at the last general election, boundary
changes should mean that their seats go to Labour.
The Boundary Commissions for England, Scotland and Wales, which are charged
with ensuring that constituency electorates remain roughly the same size,
are steadily reshaping Britain's general election map for the first time
since 1983.
Their proposals are not due to be completed until the end of the year. But
they have already forced at least four members of the government and about
20 other MPs to start considering their options if they wish to avoid losing
their seats at the next election. Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor
whose current seat is being abolished, is among prominent backbenchers in
the same position. Others include Mr David Alton, the Liberal Democrat MP,
and Dame Janet Fookes, Tory MP for Plymouth Drake and deputy speaker of the
House.
However, Labour and Conservative party managers warned at the weekend that
the changes may affect several other MPs who remain unaware that the
spotlight will fall on them.
An official at one of the major parties who is monitoring the changes said
that the successor to Mrs Edwina Currie could find that the changes turn her
Derbyshire South constituency into one of the most marginal Tory seats. Mrs
Currie, who will contest the Bedfordshire South seat in the European
Parliament this year, is to leave the Commons at the next general election.
At the last election Mrs Currie held her seat with a majority of 4,568 over
the Labour candidate. However, there are proposals to withdraw from her
constituency a ward which contributed about 2,000 of that majority. Party
managers believe that Sir George Young will find that his Ealing and Acton
constituency is strongly Labour-leaning at the next election, after five
Hammersmith wards have been added.
Officials from the Conservative and Labour parties say Sir John Wheeler will
have problems with his Westminster North constituency (due to become
Regent's Park and Kensington North), which he defended with a majority of
just 3,733 at the last election.
For Mr Soames, the loss of part of the Mid-Sussex District from Crawley
could dent the 7,765 majority which he had at the last election. Although he
is not affected by current proposals, Mr Winston Churchill will have to fend
off a Labour attempt to have his constituency abolished instead of Mr Gerald
Kaufman's. Both MPs have seats in the Greater Manchester area, where the
Boundary Commission has to select one constituency for abolition.
'In England only 17 out of the 46 counties have yet been decided upon by the
commission,' said an official at one of the major parties. 'There is still a
lot of water to go under the bridge.'
Constituency boundaries are being redrawn because demographic changes have
led to a sharp shift in populations out of metropolitan centres and into the
shire counties over the last decade. This has created expectations that the
restructuring of the political map will favour the Conservatives. According
to Westminster Communications, a political consultancy, the Tories would
have won six more seats at the 1992 election and Labour lost one had the
proposed changes been implemented at that time.
If their worst fears are realised, some of these MPs could have the
opportunity of fighting some of the 20 or so seats that will be created by
the Boundary Commission for England at the next election. However, an MP
would have to judge whether it would be politically acceptable to desert a
constituency simply because it had turned into a marginal.

FT  10 JAN 94 / Consumer credit up 8% in month
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Consumer and business credit leapt ahead in November in spite of the
uncertainty generated by the Budget, figures from two credit monitoring
organisations indicate today.
Yet the rise may not feed straight through to rising consumer spending
because credit is increasingly being used as a substitute for cash, warns
one of them, the Finance and Leasing Association.
Total consumer credit in November increased by 35 per cent to Pounds 1.17bn
compared with the corresponding month a year previously, says the
association, the industry's main trade body.
The jump is the highest since the recession began and an increase of 8 per
cent on October. Total business credit rose by 25 per cent on November 1992
to Pounds 911m.
In the three months to November, consumer credit rose by 30 per cent and
business credit by 28 per cent compared with the same period a year earlier.
Mr Tony Mallin, association chairman, said: 'Our November figures suggest
that consumer confidence has returned and we expect to see this trend
continue in December.'
Within the total consumer figure, the sharpest rise was seen in the motor
sector, reflecting a rise in car sales from the depressed levels of 1992.
Credit to consumers buying new cars through dealers in November rose 66 per
cent to Pounds 233m, compared with the same month in 1992. For used cars the
rise was 29 per cent. Both figures were slight-ly lower than for October.
Business finance for cars gained 69 per cent to Pounds 458m in November
compared with the corresponding month in 1992, although this was a 14 per
cent decline on the month before.
In consumer goods, the figures suggest a sharp rise in buying of expensive
items such as refrigerators and televisions. Store instalment credit rose 80
per cent to Pounds 106m, a much sharper rise than for store cards used for
both cheap and expensive goods where the gain was 15 per cent to Pounds
320m.
The rising value of the individual items bought is also reflected in figures
from Infolink, the credit information organisation which measures the number
of credit inquiries rather than the total amount borrowed.
Credit inquiries at finance houses, which typically offer larger loans on
expensive items, were up 9.1 per cent. Infolink said its growth figures were
lower than the FLA's because the inquiries it measures do not coincide with
actual credit given and that the amounts being lent were much bigger per
inquiry than in 1992.
Valuables are being pawned in an effort to pay off Christmas and new-year
debts, it was claimed yesterday.
Pawnbrokers have loaned 20 per cent more money than at this time last year,
said the National Pawnbrokers' Association, which represents more than 200
of the estimated 350 pawnbrokers in Britain.
'Over the Christmas period and subsequently there has been a mini-boom,' the
association said.

FT  10 JAN 94 / Figures indicate recovery in commercial property
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The scale of the recovery in the commercial property market was underlined
yesterday by figures showing total returns from property of 18.6 per cent in
1993. Capital values grew by an average of 10.2 per cent.
These estimates by Richard Ellis, a firm of chartered surveyors, reveal a
sharp improvement on the previous year when commercial property made
negative returns of 2.1 per cent.
Property's strong performance, which was particularly pronounced in the last
few months of the year, stems from a historically high income return
together with a significant fall in investment yields.
The office sector made the greatest improvement of any sector of the
property market, moving from a 1992 return of minus 5.4 per cent to just
under 20 per cent. Total returns for retail property improved from 0.2 per
cent in December 1992 to 17.6 per cent a year later. Industrial property
improved over the year from 2.3 per cent to 18 per cent.
Office values rose by nearly 11 per cent, compared with a fall of 15.4 per
cent in 1992. Retail values rose by 10 per cent, compared with a fall of 7
per cent. Industrial values improved by nearly 16 percentage points to 8.4
per cent.

FT  10 JAN 94 / Holiday price war goes into third week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The overseas holiday price war enters its third week today in spite of
widespread expectations in the industry that it would end last Saturday.
The two largest travel agents' chains say they intend to continue offering
discounts of 11 per cent. Mr Richard Bowden-Doyle, marketing director of
Lunn Poly, the largest retail chain, said the 11 per cent discounts would
apply to all summer 1994 holidays. The chain would also offer reductions of
up to Pounds 200 on winter holidays.
Going Places, the second-largest chain, said it would match Lunn Poly's
discounts. The price war began after Christmas in an attempt by travel
agents to get holidaymakers to book early.
An 11 per cent discount is close to the average commission earned by large
travel agency chains. All the largest chains said at the start of the
post-Christmas price-cutting campaign that the discounts would apply for a
limited period only.
Many in the industry expected travel agents to abandon the price war last
Saturday in favour of price cuts on a smaller range of holidays. But Lunn
Poly and Going Places said at the weekend that they had not decided when to
end the discounting campaign.
One travel industry executive said yesterday: 'It would be stupidity to
carry on for ever. If Lunn Poly were to do it for another month, I would
expect the rest of the trade to follow them. It wouldn't be a disaster if
you look at the year as a whole. If it went into a second month it would be
a problem. If you continued on 11 per cent indefinitely it would damage
margins.'
Although some travel agents said the sales in the first few days after
Christmas had been no higher than last year, bookings have now picked up. Mr
Bowden-Doyle said Lunn Poly had sold 250,000 holidays since Christmas, an
increase of 25 per cent over last year.

FT  10 JAN 94 / Confidence shown on sales growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The owners of small and medium-sized companies believe their sales will grow
an average 7.2 per cent during 1994, says a survey published today by the
accountancy firm Ernst &amp; Young.
The figure is almost three times as much as the growth forecast for the
whole economy by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, in his November Budget.
Questioning 480 chief executives of owner-managed businesses, Ernst &amp; Young
found that 58 per cent were confident that the economy would improve in the
next 12 months, compared with 64 per cent six months ago and 32 per cent a
year ago.
This confidence must be tempered with caution, says the firm, because 43 per
cent of those surveyed had not yet seen signs of recovery themselves. Yet 43
per cent planned to take on staff during 1994 and only 9 per cent expected
to make cuts.
Overall, the executives planned to employ an average of 3 per cent more
staff in 1994.
The findings come ahead of Wednesday's official unemployment figures, which
could continue the falls of recent months.
Within industries, the construction sector expects output to increase by 8
per cent during the year. This compares with an expectation of zero growth
in a similar survey a year ago.
On a regional analysis, Scotland showed the sharpest improvement, with 53
per cent expecting more orders and inquiries compared with 33 per cent six
months ago.
In the south-east, however, just 35 per cent expected more orders - a fall
from 53 per cent.
'There are good signs of increased confidence particularly in the
construction sector and in regions outside of London and the south-east.'
says Ernst &amp; Young.
The survey was carried out by MORI. Three-quarters of those surveyed owned
businesses with turnovers of less than Pounds 10m a year.

FT  10 JAN 94 / Major predicts economic growth this year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The economy will grow by between 2.5 per cent and 3 per cent this year, and
at that level 'or a little higher' next year, Mr John Major, the prime
minister, said yesterday, Kevin Brown writes.
Mr Major's forecasts, delivered in a television interview with Sir David
Frost, are slightly more optimistic than the government's Budget estimates
last November.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, forecast in his Budget speech that the
economy would grow by 2.5 per cent this year, rising to 3 per cent in
1994-95.
Mr Major also forecast that unemployment would continue to fall and
reaffirmed the government's determination to keep inflation within the
target range of 1 per cent to 4 per cent.

FT  10 JAN 94 / Union warns on Barclays job cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Union officials warned yesterday that morale among the 70,000 staff at
Barclays Bank would be hit sharply by news that a further 3,000 jobs may go
over the next two years.
'Morale has already been knocked sideways,' said Mr Rob MacGregor, assistant
secretary of the banking union Bifu. 'This news will take it through the
floor.'
Barclays is already well into a programme of job reductions aimed at
bringing the total down by 18,000 over five years from the start of 1991;
this was increased from an initial target of 15,000. Some 13,500 jobs have
gone, mostly through voluntary redundancy and natural wastage.
Mr MacGregor expected other banks and financial groups to announce job cuts
shortly. He said: 'Whichever way you look at it, more compulsory
redundancies are certainly on the cards.'

FT  10 JAN 94 / Scott Inquiry to examine UK/Iraq documents
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Scott inquiry is examining documents which suggest that the contribution
of UK manufacturing to Iraq's military enhancement was more widespread than
that suggested by Whitehall and ministers.
An official with the inquiry confirmed yesterday that Lord Justice Scott is
looking at a dossier supplied by The Sunday Times which includes allegations
that Royal Ordnance supplied material to Germany which was eventually
shipped to Iraq.
British Aerospace has denied that it has breached export regulations and is
offering to co-operate fully.
Meanwhile, the inquiry is checking United Nations documents made available
by the government to see if any of those concerning Iraq's nuclear programme
are missing. The inquiry was given information last year which had been
gathered by a UN inspectorate team and was thought to mention the names of
British companies involved.
The Sunday Telegraph yesterday said some of the documents had been
suppressed by the government.

FT  10 JAN 94 / Scott inquiry teeters between dynamite and damp squib: Jimmy
Burns explains why allegations of conspiracy and cover-up remain unclear
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nine months after the start of its public hearings, it is still not clear
whether the Scott arms-for-Iraq inquiry will produce political dynamite or a
damp squib.
Tomorrow, as the inquiry resumes its public hearings after the Christmas
recess, the former home secretary Mr Kenneth Baker will face his grilling.
Later this week the former foreign secretary Lord Howe will be called. They
will be followed next Monday by Mr John Major, the prime minister. Mr
Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence
secretary, and former foreign minister Mr Tristan Garel-Jones are also due
to appear.
What is yet to be established is whether the Thatcher administration
deliberately engaged in an organised conspiracy to supply arms illegally to
Iraq. It is also unclear whether Mr Major's government tried to ensure a
cover-up for past mistakes by issuing public-interest immunity certificates
to prevent government documents being disclosed in the trial of three former
executives of Matrix-Churchill, the machine-tool manufacturer.
In the eyes of some observers, the inquiry is running out of steam.
One former senior aide to Baroness Thatcher said: 'The inquiry is too bogged
down in minutiae. The worst Scott might conclude is that she (Lady Thatcher)
was presiding over an incompetent government.'
Yet others closer to the present administration have not ruled out the
possibility that the inquiry could put further strains on Mr Major and his
government.
'I haven't heard many colleagues talking about Scott recently,' said one
Conservative MP close to the government. 'But there is some explosive
material here.'
The issues with the most explosive potential are the use made by ministers
of immunity certificates authorising the withholding of documents, and the
extent to which British companies, with the complicity of officials and
ministers, were engaged in arming President Saddam.
At the time of the Matrix-Churchill trial in November 1992 ministers said
that disclosure would be injurious to the public interest, endanger the
lives of informants and threaten the efficiency of government.
Mr Heseltine said that Sir Nicholas Lyell, the attorney-general, had advised
him it was his duty as a minister to sign the immunity certificates. He
later told the Commons that 'what I knew, what I should have known, the
questions I should have asked' were matters that would be 'properly examined
by the Scott inquiry'.
The inquiry has now established that officials and ministers, other than
those who signed the immunity certificates, knew that Matrix-Churchill
executives were involved in intelligence activities.
It has also established that export licences for dual-use equipment were
approved even though the intelligence services knew that British
manufacturers were contributing to the enhancement of Iraq's military
capability.
Lord Justice Scott is thought now to be prepared to dispute the
attorney-general's advice to the government. He may also seek to discover
why the Matrix-Churchill trial took place, given the remarks by the former
trade minister, Mr Alan Clark, that it should not have.
But lawyers who have been following the inquiry closely believe the judge's
terms of reference are too narrow to establish the full truth of what went
on in the 1980s. Mr Christopher Muttukumaru, the secretary to the inquiry,
said: 'We are not a general investigating authority looking at the extent to
which companies breached export regulations. Our interest is in establishing
what the government knew about companies breaching export regulations.'
Further controversy could arise from the balance the judge seems to have
tried to maintain between the interests of justice and the interests of
Whitehall. 'The judge wants to be seen to be scrupulously fair so that his
report will be taken that much more seriously,' said one of his officials.
Some Whitehall officials believe ministers have tried to pass blame on to
them and warn they could kick up a fuss if they end up as scapegoats. 'We
feel as if we've been dumped on,' one witness grumbled.'
A high-ranking political source said this week that Whitehall was awaiting
with particular anticipation the evidence of Sir Robin Butler, cabinet
secretary and head of the civil service, whose guidance notes put the onus
of political responsibility on ministers.
But the inquiry is taking much longer than expected. The publication of the
judge's final report is not expected until the end of the summer and until
the furore that surrounded its instigation has dissipated.
It may now be all the harder to detect whether the inquiry will focus more
on political responsibility, or opt instead for a broad critique of the
inefficiencies of government and the shortcomings of legislation.

FT  10 JAN 94 / NHS 'health cheques' urged
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Private insurers should take over the National Health Service and issue
patients with 'health cheques' to pay for health insurance, the European
Policy Forum, a cross-party think-tank, says in a report on the UK health
service.
It said the insurance companies would commission healthcare from doctors and
hospitals. The cheques would be worth between Pounds 200 and Pounds 1,500,
depending on people's age and circumstances.
The Department of Health said an insurance-based health service had been
ruled out many years ago and this remained the case.

FT  10 JAN 94 / Hospital bed cuts attacked by Labour
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A total of 10,637 beds in National Health Service hospitals and trusts have
been lost in just one year in England, demonstrating that the service is
'slowly being whittled away', Mr David Blunkett, shadow health secretary,
said yesterday. He said Department of Health figures showed this brought the
total of beds lost to 120,000 since 1981 - a 34 per cent decrease.
But Dr Brian Mawhinney, health minister, said the number of beds was only
part of the story because the length of time a patient stays in hospital was
falling all the time; the number of patients being treated as day patients
was rapidly increasing, thanks to new techniques; and many doctors were now
carrying out minor surgical procedures.

FT  10 JAN 94 / Oil price recovery is forecast
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Oil prices will recover to about Dollars 18 a barrel by the end of the year
from Dollars 14 in the first three months, predicted NatWest Securities
yesterday.
The securities concern's oil and gas research team believes the recovery
will come even if a group of countries not affiliated to the Organisation of
Petroleum Exporting Countries is not persuaded to cut output.
It says the recent squeeze in the oil market will ease in the second half of
the year as demand for Opec oil is aided by the recovery of economies.

FT  10 JAN 94 / Flooding in south 'may cost Pounds 100m'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER and MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The damage resulting from flooding across southern England could cost up to
Pounds 100m, a firm of loss assessors said yesterday as the south and other
areas prepared for rain this week.
Mr Justin Balcombe, of loss assessors Balcombe Group, said the total cost of
the flood damage greatly exceeded the costs that would be covered by
insurance. The Association of British Insurers has estimated claims at
between Pounds 20m and Pounds 60m.
Mr Balcombe warned that many companies suffering flood damage would discover
they had breached the terms of their insurance policies, which often
stipulate that goods should be stored on pallets raised above the floor.
Large tracts of farmland, where crops have been ruined by floods, are not
covered by insurance. Another large bill for flood damage will be borne by
the owners of caravans on caravan parks, the contents of which are often
uninsured. The London Weather Centre said there would be rain on most days
this week.
Some 129 flood warnings from the National Rivers Authority were in force
last night.
By far the most critical area was Chichester, West Sussex, where mopping up
was continuing after the river Lavant broke its banks. Emergency services
were last night apprehensive and the city was being kept open by sandbags
along the A259 link road from the already blocked A27 coast road. Another
red warning - the highest level of alert - was issued for the River Hiz in
the Bedford area. A warning of flooding on the river Ouse, at Newport
Pagnell, Bucks, was expected to be lifted.

FT  10 JAN 94 / Manchester trams beat forecasts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Greater Manchester's ex-perimental 'supertram' - unique in Britain because
it runs on existing railway lines in the suburbs but takes to specially laid
tracks in the streets through the city centre - is proving more successful
than forecast.
When the first trams ran on the Pounds 132m Manchester Metrolink system in
April 1992 they were expected to be carrying about 11m passengers a year by
now, but the actual figure is 13m.
Recent surveys suggest 47 per cent of passengers leave their cars at home to
take the tram, easing traffic congestion and parking problems.
Metrolink's success is likely to encourage similar developments in other
cities in Britain and abroad. Sheffield has already laid tracks and will
begin a supertram service between the city centre and Meadowhall, an
out-of-town shopping complex, in about two months. Southampton and Croydon
are among about a dozen other places making plans.
Manchester's success is also significant because of the method of financing,
which will now be used as a model.
A consortium of public and private sectors made a competitive bid to design,
build, operate and maintain the system at the least cost to public funds -
in effect, quasi-privatisation of part of the public transport network.
The private sector gets most of its returns long-term through operations,
rather than from profits in construction and vehicle supply. It is also
obliged to maintain the network.
Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Executive and local authorities took
only a 24.7 per cent stake in the venture to keep below the 25 per cent
permitted by law for public-sector participation in private companies.
The private-sector backers - GEC Alsthom, Mowlem and Amec - then paid Pounds
5m for the franchise to operate the service under contract to the executive,
which retained control over policy.
Metrolink extensions are planned to Salford Quays and Trafford Park, with
later possible links to Rochdale, Oldham, Ashton-under-Lyne and Manchester
Airport.

FT  10 JAN 94 / Nestle announces coffee price rise
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Nestle, the food company, yesterday announced the first rise in coffee
prices since 1990.
From today the company has added 19p to the cost of a 100g jar of Nescafe,
which is expected to take the average supermarket price from Pounds 1.37 to
Pounds 1.56 by the end of the month.
Nestle said the rise was prompted by world coffee bean prices, which have
increased by a third since a producers' agreement in June last year.
Accumulated higher production costs since 1990 also played their part in the
size of the increase, Nestle said.
'There is now a formal agreement among the major coffee-producing countries
to hold back 20 per cent of their crop to keep the price up and provide a
much-needed boost to their foreign currency earnings,' the company said.

FT  10 JAN 94 / Sinn Fein rules out unionist veto on unity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The prospects for peace in Northern Ireland appeared to be receding
yesterday after Sinn Fein toughened its terms and Mr John Major, the prime
minister, again refused republican demands for 'clarification'.
In a toughly worded interview Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, ruled out
a unionist veto on constitutional change, and demanded British action to
'persuade' unionists to accept Irish unity. Mr Adams told The Observer
newspaper that 'the unionists will not move, and we cannot expect them to
move, until the British persuade them to. They have no right of a veto over
any policy'.
His comments suggest a hardening of the Sinn Fein response to the
Anglo-Irish joint declaration on Northern Ireland, which gives the unionists
an explicit veto on constitutional change.
However, Mr Adams also acknowledged that a united Ireland could not be
achieved without the participation of the unionist majority in Northern
Ireland.
In a separate statement issued in Belfast, Mr Adams repeated demands for
'clarification' of the joint declaration, which offers Sinn Fein a place at
the negotiating table within three months of a permanent IRA ceasefire.
The statement said Mr Major's refusal to clarify the declaration was 'an
abdication of his responsibilities and a clear indication that he has no
real commitment to building the peace process'.
It said Sinn Fein was prepared to 'assist' Mr Major to bring about peace.
'The sooner he stops play-acting and stringing this out, the sooner we can
all move towards an end to conflict and towards a new beginning.'
Downing Street said a letter setting out Sinn Fein's request for
clarification had not been received. But Mr Major made clear that no
clarification would be offered.
Mr Major told Sir David Frost on BBC Television that he was prepared to wait
'for a little while' for a definitive republican response to the joint
declaration. But he said the government would not be 'drawn into
negotiations by the back door' by responding to questions from Sinn Fein in
advance of a permanent IRA ceasefire.
'What at present is going on is that they are seeking to muddy (the) issue,
to enter into negotiations effectively without giving up violence,' he said.
'That is not on offer. They do have to give up violence and then the way
forward to a democratic future is perfectly clear, and the way forward for
them to get into the talks about the democratic future for Northern Ireland
is perfectly clear.'
Mr Major said the three-stranded talks process between London, Dublin and
Belfast, which began in 1992, would be intensified whatever Sinn Fein's
response to the joint declaration.

Japan's former trade minister, Mr Seiroku Kajiyama, a senior figure in the
once-dominant Liberal Democratic party, is the latest politician linked to a
bid-rigging and bribery scandal, according to the daily Asahi Shimbun
newspaper, Reuter reports from Tokyo.
Mr Kajiyama allegedly took Y10m (Pounds 60,000) from Mitsui Construction in
exchange for helping it win a public works contract in his home region.
Asahi, quoting government sources, said state prosecutors were tipped off
about Mr Kajiyama's alleged involvement during their questioning of former
regional governor Mr Fujio Takeuchi, who is on trial on charges of taking
bribes from four big contractors.
Mr Kajiyama's office allegedly contacted Mr Takeuchi, then governor of
Ibaraki north of Tokyo, to urge him to select Mitsui as one of the
contractors in a Y25bn government dam project in Ibaraki.

FT  10 JAN 94 / Palestinian peace support slips
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM, AMMAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Israel's military officer in charge of the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip
yesterday gave the cabinet a grave assessment of disintegrating Palestinian
support for the peace agreement and deteriorating economic conditions in the
territories.
Major-General Danny Roth-schild told the government that Palestinian
opposition to the peace accord was growing daily with the delay in
implementing the agreement and the worsening economic situation. At the same
time, Palestinian sources reported that three more members of the main Fatah
faction of the Palestine Liberation Organisation had resigned their
committee posts in protest at the way the PLO was being run.
Gen Rothschild's warning came hours before Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators were due to resume peace talks in the Egyptian Red Sea resort of
Taba. Both sides differed widely yesterday about how long it would take to
agree an Israeli troop withdrawal from Gaza and the West Bank area of
Jericho.
Mr Nabil Shaath, chief Palestinian negotiator, said he believed the two
sides could reach agreement within three weeks. However, Mr Yossi Sarid,
Israeli minister of the environment, said after yesterday's cabinet meeting
he thought the talks could last six to eight weeks. 'We are happy the Taba
talks are resuming but we hope the Palestinians will understand this time
that time is critical and we won't make concessions on security,' he said.
Implementation of the accord has already been delayed four weeks as the two
sides failed to reach agreement on three outstanding issues: control over
borders, the size of the Jericho area and security for Jewish settlers who
will continue to live in Gaza-Jericho.
Mr Shaath said over the weekend the two sides had reached broad agreement on
many issues such as the schedule of Israeli troop withdrawal; the
composition, size and deployment of the Palestinian police force; and the
security co-ordination for borders and roads. The remaining issues, he said,
could be settled in a similar process of compromise.
AP adds from Amman: Share prices on Amman's stock exchange came to life over
the weekend in the wake of a Jordanian-PLO economic accord, with particular
investor interest in banks which are expected to reopen branches in the
occupied West Bank.
Bank shares rose by almost the authorised daily limit of 5 per cent and
accounted for JD4.5m (Pounds 4.3m) worth of traded stock.

FT  10 JAN 94 / Burma's main rebel group to seek peace: Why the Karen are
under pressure to stop fighting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The largest remaining guerrilla group in Burma has decided to hold separate
peace talks with the government in response to mounting pressure from its
traditional backer, Thailand, and a sharp build-up in Burmese armed forces.
The ethnically based Karen National Union (KNU) will tell its colleagues in
the anti-government Democratic Alliance of Burma (DAB) of its intention to
hold talks with the government at a crisis meeting today in the Karen's
jungle headquarters in Manerplaw.
Up until now the Karen has insisted it will only talk to the Rangoon regime
as part of a comprehensive political settlement with the DAB - an umbrella
organisation of students, exiles and ethnic minorities which the KNU has
traditionally dominated.
But Dr Em Marta, head of the KNU's foreign affairs department, said in
Manerplaw: 'We're in a very tight spot. I don't think any one party on its
own could resist the pressure to negotiate.'
The president of the KNU, and its military leader, General Bo Mya, said that
if the KNU refused to go into the negotiating room alone warfare was likely
to break out with renewed vigour, with more than 30 Burmese battalions in
place around Manerplaw.
'We want peace but Slorc (State Law and Order Restoration Council) is
preparing for war. Every day they are preparing positions around us. I think
if we do not play their game then they will start the offensive,' said Gen
Bo Mya.
A Karen peace move would be a victory for the government's policy of picking
off its opponents one by one with separate ceasefire deals: a process which
began in 1989 with the collapse of the Burmese Communist party. When China
closed the border, the communist remnant was forced to ask Rangoon for food
and medicine in exchange for a peace agreement.
Late in 1993 the Kachin Independence Army, Burma's biggest guerrilla group,
was also forced into a ceasefire, under pressure from China, to the bitter
disappointment of the Karen.
The Burmese army has doubled in size in recent years, receiving over Dollars
1bn-worth of arms from China, and is now preparing to swing its full force
against the Karen's estimated 6,000 soldiers (the Karen themselves claim
20,000, including part-timers). Apart from the Karen only a few Mon and
Karreni guerrillas and students-turned-fighters remain actively hostile to
Rangoon.
The Karen have fought the Rangoon authorities since Burma won independence
from Britain in 1948 and a commitment to allow minorities to decide their
own political future was discarded. They support a federal state, rather
than rule from Rangoon, which has historically only sporadically extended
beyond the central plain. The Karen now live along the eastern border near
Thailand.
Thailand has traditionally welcomed the KNU's resistance to the Burmese
government, seeing the group as providing a buffer zone between itself and
the unstable and occasionally expansionist Burmese government. But times
have changed. And the market imperative of restoring normal relations with
its neighbour, as well as Asean's policy of constructive engagement has seen
Thailand withdraw its backing for the KNU in recent months.
Thailand, like China, is now eager to do business with the widely-reviled
regime, which has been condemned by the United Nations for murdering many of
its civilian population and for ignoring a 1990 general election which saw
overwhelming support for a democratic opposition party.
The Thai's are also worried that if fighting escalates thousands more
civilians could pour over the border to join more than 70,000 refugees from
Burma.
This shift in position has seen an end to not only Thailand's own provision
of weapons and ammunition, but also the end of its blind eye to the
involvement of Thai brokers in the buying and selling of arms between
Cambodia and the KNU. The insurgency would quickly collapse if ammunition
supplies were cut off.
To drive the point home Thailand has refused to allow key members of Burma's
Manerplaw-based government-in-exile, including the prime minister, Mr Sein
Win, to pass through Thai territory after a visit to Washington.
Few of the regime's critics believe the current ceasefires will lead to
lasting peace. The government is taking the opportunity to put a new
constitution in place, to be nominally agreed by a convention of hand-picked
delegates which has met sporadically for the last year. It is expected to
formalise the role of the military in government.

<TEXT>
Malaysia has launched a crackdown against an estimated 250,000 foreigners
who are working illegally in the country, writes Kieran Cooke from Kuala
Lumpur.
Dr Mahathir Mohamad, prime minister, said the government would ban
recruitment of unskilled and semi-skilled foreign workers until the problem
of the illegal immigrants had been sorted out.
The rapid growth of Malaysia's economy in recent years has reduced the
unemployment rate to less than 3 per cent and led to serious labour
shortages in many sectors. The government says there are 1m foreign workers
 -one in eight of the labour force - in Malaysia.
Employers in the construction and plantation industries have expressed
concern that any wide-ranging moves against foreign workers would lead to
serious production shortfalls. On some plantations up to 80 per cent of
workers are foreigners, most of them Indonesian or Bangladeshi.

FT  10 JAN 94 / France wins Dollars 2bn Saudi arms deals

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
France and Saudi Arabia have agreed to establish a joint committee to
discuss commercial co-operation and finalise industrial and armaments
contracts worth an estimated Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.34bn), after a visit to
Riyadh by Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister.
French officials said the two-day visit, which ended yesterday, had resulted
in provisional agreements to upgrade four missile-launching frigates and
maintain Saudi Arabia's Shahine anti-aircraft def-ence system and Crotale
missile system. The accords could be concluded in the next few weeks, said
one French official.
But the French delegation, which included Mr Francois Leotard, defence
minister, Mr Alain Juppe, foreign minister, and Mr Gerard Longuet, industry
minister, failed to reach agreement on a contract for three new
missile-launching frigates valued at more than Dollars 3bn.
French hopes for an agreement on civil aviation made progress, without
reaching a final agreement. Mr Balladur's delegation was attempting to
encourage Saudi purchases of Airbus aircraft which are manufactured by a
European consortium, including Aerospatiale. The consortium is in
competition with Boeing of the US to provide airliners to renew the Saudi
fleet.

FT  10 JAN 94 / Sydney hopes for rain as fires race into suburbs

   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Cooler weather late yesterday offered some hope that Sydney might soon win
its four-day battle against fires which have destroyed more than 150 homes
and killed four people, Reuter reports from Sydney.
But weather forecasters said Sydney would not see rain until Wednesday or
Thursday. 'Until we get rain, the situation remains on a knife edge,' said
Richard Whitaker, a meteorologist.
Firefighters were last night planning a massive, and risky, control burning
along a 50km line in the Blue Mountains west of Sydney, in an effort to
contain Australia's worst fire crisis in 200 years. But as night fell, wind
shifts saw hundreds more residents evacuated from southern and northern
suburbs.
On the edge of the Royal National Park, firemen evacuated more residents as
a huge fire raced towards the outlying southern suburb of Waterfall.
Helicopters were also water-bombing flames at the semi-rural Oxford Falls in
Sydney's north, while nearly 300 elderly people were evacuated in Belrose
after fires broke out in the surrounding Garigal National Park.
However, the blaze in the Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park, which had
threatened several suburbs, was slowing, and in Sydney's southern suburbs of
Jannali and Como fires were suppressed but not contained, firemen said.
About 7,500 firemen, backed by military units, are fighting 120 fires across
New South Wales. Many of the fires have been lit by arsonists.

FT  10 JAN 94 / International Press Review
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE
'A power is born', declared Le Monde on the launching of an independent Bank
of France last week. 'It is a landmark in French finance', proclaimed
L'Agefi, the business daily.
Le Nouvel Economiste, the influential weekly, even designated the nine
members of the new monetary policy council, appointed last week, as 'the
guardians of the franc'.
But there were dissenting voices from the broad consensus on the importance
of the event. 'The real significance is without doubt less than is claimed'
said Le Quotidien de Paris, the right-wing daily, in an editorial. Most of
the council's powers would be superseded by the European central bank, the
paper argued. And until then, the absence of powerful representatives from
industry and agriculture was a real limitation: 'The sages risk being a
little disconnected from economic life.'
Most of the media, however, applauded the selection of the six lay members
who will sit alongside Mr Trichet, the governor of the central bank and his
two deputies. 'A council of strong personalities' was the description
offered by La Tribune Desfosses, the financial daily.
Like most of its counterparts, the paper argued that the council represented
a welcome diversity, with members drawn from journalism to insurance. It was
also a pro-European council, unlikely to rock the boat by changing course
from the government's cautious and relatively tight monetary policy.
Some concerns were voiced about the granting of control over monetary policy
to a non-elected body. But, as Liberation, the liberal daily, concluded, the
reform was above all pragmatic. Paraphrasing Deng Xiaoping, the Chinese
leader, it asked: 'What does it matter if the cat is grey or black, as long
as it catches the mouse?'
ITALY
Italian papers have had a bonanza since the new year reporting the chaos in
pharmacies following the introduction of complex new rules on drugs sales.
The strong human interest element of a rule change which has seen sick
patients queueing outside chemists' shops only to be turned away because
they lack a prescription has even knocked the political corruption scandal
out of the papers for a few days.
Both La Repubblica, the best selling daily, and Corriere della Sera, of
Milan, carried interviews with Mrs Maria Pia Garavaglia, health minister, in
which she made a spirited defence of the reforms, aimed at reducing
over-prescription and saving money on Italy's huge annual drugs bill. In
particular, she criticised the media for exaggerating the impact and
inconvenience of the new rules.
Her accusations did not, however, curb the space devoted by the newspapers
to the grievances aired by pharmacists, doctors and representatives of big
drugs companies.
The result was a virtual free-for-all, in which each group threw mud at the
other, and they all threw mud at the Health Ministry. Il Sole 24 Ore,
Italy's leading business newspaper, gave ample space to industry spokesmen
castigating the government for its ineptitude and issuing dire warnings
about the consequences of the reforms for drugs companies.
But in the more popular press, the human interest angle, focused on the need
from January 1 for prescriptions for many medicines that could previously be
bought without a doctor's authorisation, eclipsed the industrial story. Most
papers focused on horrific tales of haemophiliacs or Aids-sufferers turned
away from chemists' shops because their medications were no longer available
without a prescription.
Again and again, their plight was confused with the simultaneous reform of
the free medicines list. As a result, stories also abounded of patients
seeking familiar drugs, previously sold at the token price of L5,000 (Pounds
2), at their full retail value.
MEXICO
The ability of the Mexican government to control the press was tested to the
limit last week, as armed rebels in the southern state of Chiapas took over
several towns and attacked soldiers in their barracks.
In the first days of the uprising, the newspapers were filled with images of
the uprising, interviews with guerrillas, eyewitness accounts of army
bombings of supposed guerrilla strongholds, and descriptions of the deaths
of rebels and civilians in shoot-outs.
But by mid-week the government seemed to have had enough of the battle-line
descriptions, and the army cut off main routes to the conflict areas. From
then on the news was dominated by government press releases and
pronouncements by political leaders.
On Thursday most papers led with the government's terms for peace: a demand
for unconditional surrender; on Friday with President Salinas's promise to
consider pardoning Indians who co-operated with the government; and on
Saturday with the interior minister's reiteration that rebels were violent
extremists who manipulated Indians to join them.
Developments in the conflict, the number of rebels, their long-term threat
to national security, and army tactics in restoring order were generally
given less importance.
Editorials, with some exceptions, toed the government line. Excelsior, the
establishment newspaper, even concluded, in language remarkably similar to
the government press release, that the rebels were 'run by true
professionals of violence that only exploit the conditions of poverty of the
Indians and use them to damage Mexico. Their objectives, above all, are far
from the demands and interests of the community'.
However, more independent newspapers such as La Jornada and El Universal
called on the army to respect the human rights of Indians when putting down
the rebellion. Carlos Fuentes, the novelist, said in La Jornada that the
uprising was provoked by the misery in which most of Mexico's Indians lived.
'The Mexican political and economic system, unjust and anti-democratic, is
co-responsible for the explosion,' he concluded.
PAKISTAN
Last week's fight among members of the Bhutto family, on the anniversary of
the birth of Mr Zulfikar ali Bhutto, the late prime minister, triggered
speculation in Pakistan's press about the government's future, amid almost
united condemnation of the scrapping.
The killing of a civilian in police firing outside al-Murtaza, the family's
ancestral home, in the southern city of Larkana, and the subsequent
vitriolic accusations by Mrs Nusrat Bhutto against her daughter, Prime
Minister Benazir Bhutto, received front page coverage in local papers. But
the national dailies ran editorials urging the two sides to resolve their
differences. 'If this situation continues unchanged, the government will
face such a great damage which even its worst enemies have not been able to
inflict so far,' said Jang, the best-selling Urdu daily.
'The family feud has now assumed alarming proportions, and even if if does
not pose a serious threat to Benazir Bhutto's political authority, it is
bound to distract her emotionally from her job as the country's prime
minister', said the opposition-supported The Nation.
The largest circulation English-language newspaper, Dawn, warned that 'a
leadership crisis of this magnitude cannot remain confined' to the ranks of
the ruling PPP (Pakistan People's party). It was bound to have wide-ranging
political and administrative repercussions, the paper said.
But it was left to The Muslim of Islamabad to point to the irony that 'the
last nail in the coffin of party unity may have been hammered over the
founder's grave site'.

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US is to ask the European Union to join an effort over the next month to
persuade Japan to open its domestic markets further.
Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, will propose today to Sir
Leon Brittan, the EU trade commissioner, that trade ministers from the
so-called Quad countries - the US, EU, Canada and Japan - hold a special
meeting probably early next month to discuss the issue.
Mr Kantor told the Financial Times in Brussels that 'a window of
opportunity' was open between January 29, by which time Japan is expected to
have passed new economic stimulus measures, and the middle of February.
Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, Japan's prime minister, is due in Washington on
February 11, while Mr Peter Sutherland, director-general of Gatt, has
invoked a February 15 deadline for new market access proposals.
Noting European dissatisfaction with recent Japanese offers on white
spirits, copper and other commodities, Mr Kantor said it was time for the US
and the EU to go 'shoulder-to-shoulder' to impress on Tokyo the need for
greater initiatives.
Quad officials already have a meeting scheduled for January 19. Assuming Sir
Leon attends, that could be followed by a full ministerial session roughly
two weeks later.
Mr Kantor emphasised that it was incumbent on all industrialised nations to
open and build their domestic markets. He put this challenge on a par with
US proposals to make Europe's security appropriate for the post-cold war
era.
Mr Kantor was added to President Clinton's European travelling party last
week not only, he said, to propose a harder line with Japan. Also on his EU
agenda are following up on the Uruguay Round agreement and reaching a new
agreement opening up European procurement policies on heavy electrical
equipment.

FT  10 JAN 94 / Mexico City hit by four bombs as uprising spreads
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Four bombs exploded in Mexico City over the weekend, and a hand grenade was
tossed at a government building in the Pacific resort of Acapulco, in
further signs of an extension of last week's uprising in the southern state
of Chiapas.
A group claiming to represent a previously active urban subversive movement,
known by its Spanish initials Procup-PDLP, told news agencies it was
responsible for three of the attacks. A man claiming to represent the
movement told the Italian wire service Ansa that it was acting in
'solidarity' with the self-described Zapatista Army of National Liberation
which led the new year uprising in the southern state of Chiapas.
The Mexican government has linked the Zapatistas with Procup, and said it
has found its propaganda in the Zapatista camps. Another caller, claiming to
represent the Zapatistas, claimed responsibility for the first of the bombs.
There were no deaths or injuries reported, and Procup, as is its custom,
appears to have chosen its targets to cause material damage. The first car
bomb, early on Saturday morning, destroyed a car park and damaged nearby
shops. Another bomb exploded near a military base in the district of
Naucalpan, and two others were planted next to an electricity tower in the
district of Cuautitlan.
In Chiapas the army continued to seal off the conflict zones as soldiers
hunted for the Zapatista rebels. The search is taking place in the hills
around San Cristobal de las Casas and other towns which the rebels seized
earlier last week. Around 100 people have already died in the uprising,
according to official figures.
The government said the rebels were 'not an indigenous movement nor is it
peasants' action'. They were 'professionals manipulating the disaffected and
those who have suffered from recent adverse economic conditions'.
The Attorney-General's Office has concluded that of the 30 bodies found in
the town of Ocosingo, four had been executed at close range. However, it
said that three of them were shot with rifles not used by the Mexican army,
ruling out the possibility, in its view, of army responsibility. It said an
investigation would continue to determine who was responsible. The bodies
appeared to be those of Zapatista rebels.

FT  10 JAN 94 / US in BCCI deal with Abu Dhabi
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ABU DHABI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US has reached a deal with Abu Dhabi that settles some of the
counterclaims on the assets of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce
International and gives US prosecutors access for the first time to a key
BCCI executive.
Representatives of the US Justice Department, the New York district attorney
and the Federal Reserve Board, as well as trustees for First American, the
US bank illegally controlled by BCCI, agreed on Saturday to drop a civil
lawsuit against Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan, the ruler of Abu Dhabi and BCCI's
majority shareholder. They also agreed not to pursue any criminal charges
against Sheikh Zayed.
The charges have provoked a diplomatic controversy, with Sheikh Zayed
claiming sovereign immunity.
In exchange, Abu Dhabi agreed to give up claims on Dollars 400m (Pounds
270m) lent to the money-losing First American, and its 28 per cent stake in
the Washington-area bank, and to make available to US prosecutors Mr Swaleh
Naqvi, the second-ranking manager of BCCI, who has been under house arrest
pending charges in the Gulf emirate. Justice Department officials yesterday
said Mr Naqvi could be brought to the US within four months.
Abu Dhabi has also agreed to give US investigators complete access to BCCI
documents and to allow them to question 10 former bank employees being held
in the country.
According to reports, the Dollars 400m recovered under the deal will be
split between the US government and BCCI depositors, with some of the money
used to provide severance pay to First American employees and some to pay
for the continuing civil lawsuits brought by First American's trustees
against other defendants.
A spokesman for the Abu Dhabi government said last night: 'We have always
been keen to give assistance to BCCI creditors.'
US and New York prosecutors have failed ignominiously in their efforts to
pursue the fallout from BCCI's failure in 1991. Mr Robert Altman, a
Washington lawyer who was accused of serving as a cat's paw for BCCI in its
takeover of First American, was acquitted by a New York jury on charges of
bank fraud, and similar charges against Mr Clark Clifford, the former US
defence secretary and Mr Altman's partner, were dropped.
Prosecutors have said that their inability to question Mr Naqvi, top
assistant to BCCI founder Agha Hassan Abedi, has impeded their efforts.
The United Arab Emirates has issued a formal summons to bring Mr Abedi to
trial for his alleged role in the bank's failure, Reuter reports from Abu
Dhabi. Mr Abedi, 71 and in ill health, is believed to be living in Karachi.
He and 12 other former executives of the bank he founded in 1972 face
charges and civil suits worth up to Dollars 10.2bn in Abu Dhabi.

FT  10 JAN 94 / Trade negotiators face hectic three months: Structure of the
World Trade Organisation must be agreed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Although the Uruguay Round of global trade talks formally ended on December
15, trade negotiators returning to Geneva this week after the Christmas
break have a busy agenda in prospect.
In the next three months they must decide on the structure, membership and
work programme of the World Trade Organisation, the body which will police
fair trade rules and implement the results of the Round. Recommendations
will be put to ministers when they meet in Marrakesh on April 12-15 to sign
the Uruguay Round accords.
It is already accepted that work on the link between trade and the
environment will feature strongly in the work programme. But the nature of
that work has yet to be agreed and big differences remain between rich
nations and poorer countries who fear environmental concerns will be used as
a pretext for trade protection.
Other issues jostling for the WTO's attention, such as competition policy,
worker rights and currency movements, are also likely to be contentious.
Ministers will also be asked to approve transitional institutional
arrangements for transforming the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
into the WTO, which will come into effect with the rest of the Uruguay Round
by July 1995.
These arrangements, which are likely to include the setting up of an interim
committee for the WTO, will mean more staff and money, but Gatt officials
insist extra demands will be modest.
In addition, ministers must decide on WTO membership and, in particular,
what to do about countries applying to join Gatt which want to become
original members of the WTO. Of these, the most important by far is China.
Trade officials will also be using the coming weeks to complete country
tariff schedules. For most countries this will simply be a matter of
formalising what has already been negotiated, but substantive talks are
continuing on textiles tariffs and between the European Union and Latin
American banana exporters.
Countries have until February 15, when all draft final tariff schedules must
be in, to negotiate improved offers. But they cannot withdraw concessions
already made unless trading partners fail to deliver their part of the
bargain.
Meanwhile, the Gatt secretariat has until the end of March to check the
tariff and services schedules for consistency, and tidy up the Uruguay Round
texts ready for endorsement in Marrakesh.
Trade negotiators must also try to reach agreement in several areas where
they failed to meet the December deadline. The most pressing is completion
of talks on a Multilateral Steel Agreement, which the US would like to tie
up before April. A renewed attempt to agree a revised Gatt code on subsidies
for civil aircraft is planned to conclude by the end of this year.
Talks on liberalising trade in four key services sectors will also continue
this year. Negotiations on financial services will kick off later this month
when the US and Japan hold talks under their bilateral negotiating
framework.
Negotiations on labour services, shipping and basic telecommunications are
due to start within a month of the Marrakesh meeting. Talks on financial and
labour services must conclude in 1995 but those on shipping and
telecommunications will run into 1996.
Finally, just to ensure that trade officials are not left twiddling their
thumbs, a new set of negotiations is already programmed for the start of the
WTO in 1995. To take just one example, the Uruguay Round commits countries
to initiate work on common standards for professional services, beginning
with accountancy.

FT  10 JAN 94 / Wibble sees signs of life in ailing Swedish economy: Figures
are starting to add up for tough-minded finance minister
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mrs Anne Wibble, Sweden's finance minister, is a plain-speaking politician
who has pulled few policy punches as she has battled her way through two
years of economic crisis. With a deficit still of towering proportions, she
has little room to offer relief when she announces her 1994-95 budget today.
But the dour Wibble demeanour of the past is likely to give way to a more
upbeat message. As a general election looms in September and with the
economy at last showing signs of revival, the right-centre coalition is
anxious to show that its market-oriented medicine is beginning to work a
cure on the deepest recession Sweden has suffered since before the second
world war.
According to finance ministry figures leaked last week, the economy is
reckoned to have shrunk by 2 per cent last year, not the near 3 per cent
forecast last October. The ministry predicts gross national product growth
of 2.4 per cent this year against its previous estimate of 1.9 per cent.
Sharply improved competitiveness, stemming from a 25 per cent fall in the
value of the Swedish krona last year and significant improvements in
productivity, has given a shot in the arm to export-oriented manufacturers.
As a result, the new figures show industrial production rose in 1993 by 2.7
per cent and will grow by 8.5 per cent this year; exports are set to rise by
more than 10 per cent this year after a 7.4 per cent surge in 1993, and the
current account is expected to move into surplus.
The government can also point to other positive trends. Interest rates have
fallen steadily to around 5 per cent, producing, among other effects, a
dramatic improvement in the performance of commercial banks which a year ago
were brought to their knees by a spate of loan losses. Although the bank
crisis has cost the taxpayer some SKr90bn (Pounds 7.3bn) in bail-out
commitments, there should now be no more calls on the state coffers.
Inflation, the bugbear of the Swedish economy in the 1980s, also seems to be
under control, despite the heavy devaluation of the krona. It rose by more
than 4 per cent in 1993 but should be about 2.5 per cent this year and
remain steady in 1995.
All this has given the government, led by Mr Carl Bildt's conservative
Moderates, grounds for proclaiming that its market reform policies have laid
the basis for a sustained recovery through to the end of the century. But it
still faces an uphill battle to rebuff the claim by the opposition Social
Democrats that this rosy prediction ignores the deep malaise still
afflicting the domestic economy.
Above all, the export-led upturn has made no impact on record levels of
unemployment, which pose the biggest threat to the government. In less than
four years, the proportion of the workforce on the dole or in state training
schemes has risen from around 5 per cent to 14 per cent. At best, only a
marginal reduction is expected this year.
Most of the output gains in the export industries are being made through
improved productivity, while the domestic sector continues to be suppressed
by low private consumption and the deficit-driven squeeze on public
spending. Private consumption, which accounts for 55 per cent of GNP, shrank
by some 4 per cent in 1993, and is expected to show only marginal growth
this year. Net investment is predicted to contract by around 7 per cent this
year after a fall of 14 per cent last.
Meanwhile, unemployment costs especially have thwarted the government's
efforts to control the budget deficit, which autumn forecasts predicted
would reach 15 per cent of GNP in the current June-July budget year. Central
government debt has shot up to more than SKr1,000bn (Pounds 81.3bn), or
about 70 per cent of GNP, from about SKr600bn in 1990. Despite some hefty
cuts in public spending programmes, the public sector still accounts for
around 70 per cent of GNP in Sweden.
The Social Democrats, warning of a 'debt trap' if there is not a speedy
return to growth and a fall in unemployment costs, have called for a demand
stimulus to kick-start the domestic economy. They suggest a cut in value
added tax and delays in other planned tax increases.
But Mrs Wibble (who belongs to the Liberal party) has insisted there is no
room for a fiscal stimulus. As much as she and Mr Bildt would dearly love to
cut the tax burden, the finance minister insisted in an interview in
December that curbing the deficit remains the priority, even in an election
year.
Newspaper reports have warned of more cuts in welfare benefits today to help
get the borrowing requirement back on a downward curve.

FT  10 JAN 94 / Bosnia presses for protective Nato air strikes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Bosnian officials are planning a diplomatic drive to persuade Nato to launch
air strikes against Serb positions as a means of protecting aid convoys and
lifting the siege of Sarajevo.
Separately, in a letter sent to this week's Nato summit in Brussels, the
Bosnian government urges the defence alliance's involvement in any peace
plan agreed between Bosnia, Croatia and Serbia.
'Nato is the only entity that can muster the necessary forces with the
proper mandate and resources that are critical to a successful programme,'
it said. The letter coincides with growing impatience within the European
Union over failure to reach a negotiated political settlement.
Yesterday, Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, Belgian prime minister, said the Nato summit
must 'give a signal. . . We must seriously consider whether to carry out air
strikes'.
The US and Britain sent a demarche to Serbia's President Slobodan Milosevic
at the weekend stating that air strikes in support of aid convoys had not
been ruled out.
In an interview on BBC television yesterday, Mr John Major, British prime
minister, reaffirmed the UK's readiness to launch air strikes if the UN
requested Nato to do so.
The renewed attempts by the Bosnian government to involve Nato came as Lord
Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, the international peace negotiators,
sought agreement between Bosnia and Croatia on a ceasefire in and around
Vitez, a Croat enclave in the centre of the republic.
Talks, which had been due to open in Bonn on Saturday, were postponed until
yesterday after shelling at Sarajevo airport prevented Bosnian President
Alija Izetbegovic's departure.
The talks between Mr Izetbegovic and President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia
will aim to end conflict in central Bosnia and reach agreement on the future
status of Mostar in western Hercegovina. Bosnia's access to the sea under an
eventual peace agreement will also be discussed.
But Bosnian government officials yesterday said they were determined to hold
on to the area around Vitez. 'There are crucial military installations and
production facilities here,' a senior diplomat said.
Moslem forces pushed forward against their Croat adversaries in the town of
Vitez as British UN troops braved the fighting to rescue fleeing civilians.
The clashes heighten the prospects for all-out military intervention by
Croatia, after warnings last week by Mr Tudjman and senior Croat officials
that Zagreb would intervene if the Moslems did not halt their offensive in
the strategic Lasva valley, in central Bosnia.
A British officer in Vitez yesterday said the Moslems appeared to have
launched a surprise pre-dawn attack. At least four people were killed,
including three children, and more than 30 injured in the fighting,
according to local officials. As the fighting flared, British forces in
armoured personnel carriers helped evacuate civilians from surrounding
villages.
Meanwhile, spurning western threats to launch air strikes against Serb
forces attacking Sarajevo, Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic reiterated
his aim to create a Greater Serbia.
'Our goal is to unite with Serbia, we cannot hide that. This is our right,'
he told an assembly session marking the second anniversary of the
declaration of his self-styled Serb state. The meeting was held in Pale, the
mountain stronghold less than 10 miles east of the besieged Bosnian capital.

FT  10 JAN 94 / Bribery claims shake Belgium: Leaked allegations involve
three French-speaking ministers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Belgium was shaken this weekend by the publication of leaked allegations of
bribery and corruption at the heart of the country's French-speaking
Socialist party, one of four members of the fragile governing coalition.
Mrs Veronique Ancia, an investigating magistrate from Liege, wants to
question three Socialist ministers about claims that money was promised to
the party in relation to a 1988 contract for military helicopters awarded to
Agusta, the Italian aircraft manufacturer.
Members of the national parliament, and the assemblies of the country's
Walloon region and French-speaking community, will this week consider
whether to agree to her request that the ministers' parliamentary immunity
be lifted.
But the formal procedure may be disrupted by the wholesale leaking of the
secret report justifying Mrs Ancia's request.
The report was widely quoted by Flemish radio last week and published in
full by certain Belgian newspapers on Saturday.
'What is at stake in this affair is too important. . . . for the truth never
to see the light of day,' the francophone daily La Libre Belgique argued in
an editorial.
As published, the report alleges that vital documents were doctored to
favour the Agusta bid over French and German competition. It concludes that
'the way in which the contract was granted was tainted with illegal acts. .
. . and forgery'.
Mrs Ancia's inquiry has been based on interviews with sources including Mr
Philippe Moureaux, another senior member of the French-speaking Socialist
party, ministerial advisers, and senior army officers.
All three Socialist ministers - Mr Guy Coeme, Belgian deputy prime minister,
Mr Guy Spitaels, minister-president of Wallonia, and Mr Guy Mathot, Walloon
minister of internal affairs - again denied last week that they were
involved in any wrongdoing.
Critics of the way in which the inquiry has been handled now say two key
principles of Belgian law - the secrecy of legal investigations and the
presumption of innocence - have been broken.
Mr Mathot claimed yesterday that he was being subjected to the 'justice of
the streets', with no right of defence.
Public discussion of the scandal has also raised fears of a split in the
francophone Socialist party, a rekindling of animosity between
French-speaking Wallonia and Dutch-speaking Flanders, and even the
disintegration of the government itself.
The Volksunie, a moderate Flemish nationalist party, certain young
French-speaking Christian Democrats, and most of the Flemish press have
already called for the resignation of Mr Coeme, who was defence minister at
the time of the Agusta deal.
Agusta itself has always denied any connection with illegal financial
dealings.

FT  10 JAN 94 / Kohl aide's call on arms sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARIANE GENILLARD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Friedrich Bohl, a senior aide to Chancellor Helmut Kohl, yesterday called
for a revision of Germany's strict guidelines on arms exports.
Speaking on radio, Mr Bohl, minister in charge of the chancellery, defended
a proposal by conservative parliamentarians last week to lower Germany's
tough 1982 restrictions on weapons exports and harmonise them with less
stringent standards in the European Union.
Mr Bohl said it was 'fully unrealistic' to expect Germany's EU partners to
raise their own arms trade restrictions. 'We have to reach a reasonable
compromise in line with our moral standards and international obligations.'
The restrictions include a ban on arms sales to any conflict zone or 'area
of tension'. This rules out German arms exports to most of the Middle East.
They also apply to technology easily converted from civilian to military
use.
Conservative members of parliament have recently stepped up pressure on the
federal government with calls for a relaxation of the guidelines. Members of
the Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU), a key coalition partner for Mr
Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU), have been particularly vocal in an
effort to help the local arms industry, which faces large job-losses because
of the recession and federal defence cuts.
Mr Karl Lammers, foreign affairs spokesman for the CDU/CSU in parliament,
last week put forward a proposal for more liberal guidelines to allow
cross-border co-operation in the defence industry. The idea has received
strong support from the powerful BDI industry federation.
'The threatened exit of German companies from the field of defence
technology must be prevented. This would have drastic consequences for our
competitiveness, our security and foreign policy and the capacity of our
army,' said a BDI statement. German businessmen complain that Germany's
tough restrictions are giving an unfair advantage to competitors, such as
French companies.
German restrictions on the sales of armaments abroad have been tightened in
the last decade after it was found out that German defence equipment was
used in Libya and Iraq.

<TEXT>
Italy's fragile eight-month government headed by Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi
faces one of its sternest tests this week as parliament votes on a
no-confidence motion on Wednesday which could determine Mr Ciampi's future
and the timing of new elections.
The political tension rose over the weekend after magistrates started
interrogating Mr Maurizio Broccoletti and Mr Luigi Bisignani, two central
figures in the long-running political corruption scandal, who returned to
Italy last week. Both are believed to have access to important evidence
which could affect the future of the present government and influence this
week's parliamentary debate.
The most explosive testimony is expected to come from Mr Broccoletti, a top
secret service administrator, extradited from Monaco on Thursday. He has
claimed a string of senior ministers regularly received payments from the
secret services over the past decade. Mr Broccoletti's allegations include
two previous interior ministers, administratively responsible for the secret
services, and the present incumbent, Mr Nicolo Mancino.
His claims, which come as Italy's political parties manoeuvre frantically
for advantage ahead of the no-confidence vote, could provoke further
ministerial resignations. They also involve Mr Vincenzo Parisi, head of the
national police force. His offer to resign at the weekend was rejected by
the government, and he is expected to make a statement to magistrates this
week.
Allegations of high-level corruption by Mr Broccoletti before he went into
hiding rocked the political establishment last November and triggered an
unprecedented television address to the nation from President Oscar Luigi
Scalfaro. Mr Broccoletti has now raised the stakes by accusing several
ministers, and Mr Scalfaro, a former interior minister, of covering up the
evidence.
The claims, however, have been treated with caution amid a stream of
conflicting allegations, including suggestions that some secret service
members have been conducting a disinformation campaign against the
government.
Mr Bisignani, one of the six remaining suspects in hiding in the corruption
scandal, surrendered to Milan police on Friday. Magistrates believe he
played a vital role passing illegal payments from industry to senior
politicians.
A former Rome correspondent for the Ansa news agency, Mr Bisignani had
high-level political contacts, notably in the Christian Democrat party. He
is also believed to have played a central role in transferring large
kickbacks from the Montedison chemicals group, where he was head of external
relations, to the parties during negotiations to dissolve the Enimont
chemicals joint venture in 1990.

FT  10 JAN 94 / Ciampi's fate in the hands of parliament: No-confidence
debate will prove decisive either way
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For experienced watchers of Italian politics, the coalition government's
closing weeks show all the signs of Roman politics at their most
introspective.
Rather than mirroring the mood of change supposedly sweeping the country,
the talks held last week by Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, the prime minister, and
party leaders ahead of Wednesday's crucial no-confidence vote were more
reminiscent of the sort of back-room dealing which has been a hallmark of
Italian politics since the second world war.
But whatever the manoeuvrings before the parliamentary motion, the debate
itself is expected to prove decisive for Mr Ciampi's future and the timing
of general elections.
Although the prime minister has been sibylline about his tactics, President
Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, with whom Mr Ciampi has co-operated closely, is widely
expected to dissolve parliament immediately after the debate, irrespective
of its outcome.
In early December, most Italians had expected President Scalfaro to announce
the election date in his year-end address. Almost two years of political
corruption investigations have cut a swathe through the political
establishment and mid-March appeared most likely.
Shortly before the address, however, Mr Marco Panella, leader of the small
Radical party, persuaded many deputies to table a no-confidence motion. In
the circumstances, Mr Scalfaro, a firm believer in parliamentary rights,
decided to delay an announcement until the legislature had expressed itself
on the Ciampi government.
The Christmas break and Mr Ciampi's commitments at this week's Nato summit
in Brussels have postponed the debate until Wednesday. In the interim, the
prime minister has sounded out party leaders on the timing of elections.
Party attitude to the polls fall into three camps. The clearest is that of
the Democratic Party of the Left, the Northern League and the neo-fascist
MSI. All three, though light years apart ideologically, expect to perform
well and therefore want an early vote.
By contrast, a large number of deputies, predominantly from the coalition of
Christian Democrats, Socialists and two smaller parties which technically
support Mr Ciampi, want it put off for as long as possible. Their motive is
self-interest. Dozens of deputies caught up in the corruption scandals have
managed to avoid interrogation - and possible incarceration - thanks to
their parliamentary immunity. Should they lose their seats, their immediate
prospects are not rosy.
The third camp also comprises members of the four-party coalition. They,
too, would like polling postponed, ideally to June, when they could be
combined with European parliamentary elections.
However, their motives are substantially different from those of their
colleagues fearing prosecution. Headed by Mr Mino Martinazzoli, the
Christian Democrat leader, the third group sees postponement as offering an
opportunity to regroup the tattered centre of Italian politics.
Mr Martinazzoli's DCs, traditionally an umbrella party bringing together
widely different schools of thought, are most exposed. Once Italy's biggest
grouping, the party is set to suffer badly at the ballot box. Some
right-wing members have already defected to Mr Mario Segni, the popular
former Christian Democrat, whose popular referendum movement has been the
catalyst for many of the most important political reforms of the past two
years.
The Christian Democrats are also fraying on the left. Deputies from the
Veneto region have called for the immediate creation of a party to replace
its discredited forerunner. Last week another splinter group, dubbed the
'neo-centrists', attacked Mr Martinazzoli's leadership with calls for deeper
reforms.
The pressures within the Christian Democrats have been clearly communicated
to President Scalfaro, himself a former DC minister, and Mr Ciampi, whose
coalition is largely based on the party's support.
So far, both men have resisted the pressures. Mr Ciampi is a former central
bank governor who has made much of his current role as leader of an
'institutional' government of technocrats largely independent from party
politics. Mr Scalfaro, who is required to put aside his former political
allegiances as head of state, has shown admirable impartiality.
The latest twist in the political corruption scandal, with the extradition
last week from Monaco of Mr Maurizio Broccoletti, has raised the pressures
further on both men. However, Mr Broccoletti's allegations, far from
intimidating the president and prime minister, may only stiffen Mr
Scalfaro's resolve to call elections as soon as possible.

More than 3,000 elected officials from Slovakia's Hungarian minority agreed
at the weekend on a plan designed to protect and expand ethnic Hungarian
rights in Slovakia.
However, they pulled back from possible confrontation with the government by
dropping demands for an autonomous Hungarian province with its own
parliament.
There are about 600,000 ethnic Hungarians, representing 12 per cent of the
population, in Slovakia. They live mostly in provinces bordering Hungary in
a wide arc stretching from Bratislava, the Slovak capital in the west, to
Kosice and the Ukrainian border in the east.
Local representatives who met in a packed sports' hall in the southern
Slovak city of Komarno on Saturday, agreed to campaign for the establishment
of a single administrative district comprising either one or three regions
that would guarantee 'basic freedoms and human rights' for ethnic
Hungarians.
These proposals counter government plans included in a broader
administrative reform that would divide the areas inhabited by ethnic
Hungarians along north-south axes, thereby diluting Hungarian representation
at local and national level.
The meeting was called by an organisation established by mayors concerned at
what they perceive as growing discrimination against the Hungarian minority.
The removal of bilingual road signs earlier this year, and the passing of a
law forcing Hungarian women to add the Slovak 'ova' to their family name,
have caused widespread resentment.

FT  10 JAN 94 / Clinton calls for unity of east and west Europe: President
says US depends on the security of a democratic continent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Bill Clinton opened his first presidential visit to Europe with a
powerful call for integration of the continent, east and west, as part of a
renewed partnership with the US.
At least 100,000 US troops, he said, would remain in Europe 'not out of
habit' but because the commitment was 'justified'.
Proclaiming a 'new day for our transatlantic partnership' in a speech at
Brussels town hall, the president declared that the US depended on the
security of a free and democratic Europe.
Mr Clinton said that the 'new security' would rest on three pillars -
military strength, to be discussed at the Nato summit beginning today;
economic security (Mr Clinton also announced that the long-delayed 'jobs
summit' would be held in March); and the growth of democracy, which could
prove effective in preventing another Bosnia.
Mr Clinton commended to European attention the US Partnership for Peace
proposals, to be endorsed at the Nato summit which would allow eastern
European states gradually to strengthen their links with Nato.
Alluding to fears aroused by the rise of Russian nationalism, Mr Clinton
maintained it would be wrong 'to draw a new line between east and west that
could create a self-fulfilling prophecy of future confrontation'.
While 'the statements of some Russian political figures have given us all
genuine cause for concern', the 'staggering' recent developments in Russia
had to be kept in perspective. 'Our road to Europe's integration will be
wider, smoother and safer' if Russia could be helped to evolve into 'a
market democracy at peace with its neighbours', he said.
It was vital that what might prove to be a 'fleeting' opportunity to bring
the former Soviet bloc on should board not be missed, he said. Integration
might prove 'gradual and often difficult', as Germany's experience had
shown, but 'the Iron Curtain must not be replaced by a veil of
indifference'. Mr Andrei Kozyrev, Russia's foreign minister, echoed Mr
Clinton's theme yesterday, saying fears of a new 'threat from the east'
would be dispelled by a strategy of partnership with the democratic forces
in Russia, in spite of the success of the ultra-nationalist and communist
parties in last month's elections.
In particular, Mr Clinton urged western Europe to open its economic doors to
the east. The success of eastern Europe 'will ultimately depend more on
trade than aid', given the shortage of money in western government coffers.
This meant continuing to reduce barriers to trade and investment, a message
he will reinforce at a session with European Union leaders tomorrow.
He is due to travel on to Prague, Moscow, Minsk and Geneva but that
itinerary could change should a satisfactory agreement be reached over the
dismantling of the nearly 1,800 former Soviet nuclear missiles based in
Ukraine.
A senior US official last night said 'a great deal of progress' had been
made in negotiations involving Ukraine and Russia to resolve the question of
the warheads. But he refused to speculate on whether Mr Clinton would fit in
a meeting with Ukrainian president Leonid Kravchuk to initial any agreement,
which would still be subject to ratification by the parliament in Kiev.
A US offer to buy up to 500 tons of uranium extracted from Russian and
Ukrainian missiles remains on the table.

FT  10 JAN 94 / Tory anger grows over handling of 'back to basics'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The back to basics initiative launched by Mr John Major appeared close to
foundering yesterday as questions mounted over the prime minister's handling
of the issue.
He defended the initiative vigorously, but there were signs of growing anger
among Tory MPs about the muddle over values which has dogged the campaign
since it was launched at the party conference in October.
In the past two weeks it was revealed that Mr Tim Yeo, the former
environment minister, had fathered two children out of wedlock by different
women; that Mr Alan Duncan, a minister's parliamentary assistant, had
resigned after disclosures about a business deal; and that a Conservative
backbencher was reported by his wife to have allegedly left her for a man.
It also emerged that Mr Steven Norris, transport minister, may face a
re-selection battle in his Epping constituency over claims that he has had
five mistresses.
Interviewed on the BBC's Breakfast with Frost, Mr Major sought to defuse the
row by denying that back to basics was a moral crusade, and drawing a
distinction between bad behaviour and tolerance of indiscretions. He said it
was 'proper' that ministers should resign if they behaved 'badly'. But 'if
someone commits a silly indiscretion, I am not in the business of a
witch-hunt'.
Mr Major urged his colleagues to show 'tolerance and understanding' to MPs
who behaved 'foolishly', and insisted that recent events did not invalidate
the initiative.
Senior Conservatives refused to comment publicly on the initiative in an
attempt to avoid stir-ring up fresh controversy when parliament resumes
tomorrow.
However, many rightwing MPs have been angered by the prime minister's
handling of the issue, which some see as a betrayal of family values. By
contrast, mainstream Conservatives who were worried by the moralistic tone
of the initiative are concerned that Mr Major has given a further hostage to
fortune by attempting to distinguish between classes of bad behaviour.
Sir Edward Heath, a strong supporter of the prime minister, said it was
'highly dangerous' for ministers to moralise. 'People, particularly the
British, dislike being preached at,' he said.
The confusion prompted a scathing attack by Mr John Smith, the Labour
leader, who claimed the initiative had 'collapsed in its own
contradictions'. Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, accused Mr
Major of offering the electorate 'bland slogans, muddled thinking and
complacency'.

FT  10 JAN 94 / Video game makers in US to set up age rating system
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Video game manufacturers in the US, under political pressure to limit the
violence and sexual content of their products, have agreed to set up a
system to rate games according to their suitability for children.
In an initial proposal outlined this weekend at the Consumer Electronics
Show in Las Vegas, the Software Publishers Association, representing 1,100
companies, suggested a four-level system ranging from E for everyone to AO
for adults only.
Game makers would rate their own products, but they could be fined by an
industry-appointed council if they violated agreed guidelines. Some video
game companies, including Sega, which has overtaken Nintendo as US market
leader, already publish ratings with their games, but the industry is still
some way from final agreement on how to make the system general.
In the UK, makers, including 3DO, Atari, Electronic Arts and software
publishing houses, said they are developing a governing board to set
standards. At the moment there is no separate UK ratings system for games.
But as games get bloodier and more realistic with advanced graphics, the
Dollars 6bn (Pounds 4bn)-a-year industry is under mounting pressure from US
Congress and from customers to crack down on some of the more explicit
games.
Senator Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut and Senator Herb Kohl of Wisconsin
have proposed a bill that would impose ratings on the video game industry if
it fails to develop a satisfactory system of its own within a year.
Although the Software Publishers Association proposal is now expected to
form the basis for an industry-wide rating system, there is still
disagreement among game makers over how such a system should operate.
Some big companies favour an independent rating authority as the only way of
ensuring uniform and credible standards, while others argue that the cost
and delay involved in such an authority would be devastating to their
profitability.

FT  10 JAN 94 / Rail concession may boost privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A private rail company planning a freight link to the channel tunnel has
been given the right to own its own track, in a key concession which could
reopen the debate over a central component of the government's plans for
rail privatisation.
The Department of Transport has allowed the Central Railway Group to
negotiate the purchase of the track it needs to set up a 180-mile link
between the Midlands and the tunnel.
The concession is a direct challenge to Railtrack, the company set up to own
and manage former British Rail lines from April. Railtrack is in the midst
of tense negotiations with the Treasury over the value of its assets.
The concession meets one of the main reservations expressed by potential
bidders for rail franchises. If it were extended to other potential private
rail operators, more might be attracted to bid for franchises.
Most of Central Railway's route runs along disused British Rail track or
alongside existing lines, but it crucially includes 40 miles of British
Rail's Chiltern lines.
Sea Containers, the shipping company which is a potential bidder for a
British Rail franchise, said the concession was 'very interesting and
encouraging to other bidders. But it depends on how far the government is
prepared to go with it'.
Mr Roger Freeman, the transport minister, in a letter dated July 15 1993,
gives permission to the Central Railway Group 'to negotiate with Railtrack
with a view to establishing the terms on which railway infrastructure and
operational land could be acquired'. The letter is reproduced in a
fund-raising prospectus published by the group.
The government has said most of the British Rail network will be owned by
Railtrack; the only previous exception allowed was the Isle of Wight's
railway network. But pressure is growing for Scotrail, the Scottish network,
to be sold off too.
The ban on owning the track has been criticised by several potential bidders
for BR franchises. The founder and chairman of the Central railway Group, Mr
Andrew Gritten, said ownership of the track was essential if the company was
to raise finance for the project, which is expected to cost Pounds 3bn.
The company is attempting to raise Pounds 6m from City institutions to
prepare the project for parliamentary approval. A second stage fund-raising
of Pounds 25m is planned to obtain a stock market listing which, it is
hoped, will raise nearly Pounds 1bn. At the time of listing Pounds 2.1bn of
debt would also be raised.

FT  10 JAN 94 / Paramount contest still open after cool reaction to Viacom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.7bn) takeover battle for Paramount Communications
appeared wide open yesterday as Wall Street reacted unenthusiastically to a
new offer from cable company Viacom and rival bidder QVC Network hinted it
might cry foul over Viacom's behaviour.
Viacom announced on Friday night that it had entered an Dollars 8.4bn merger
agreement with video retailer Blockbuster Entertainment and, helped by
Dollars 1.25bn of Blockbuster cash, was increasing its cash offer for 50.1
per cent of Paramount's stock.
This went up from Dollars 85 a share to Dollars 105 a share, topping a
Dollars 92 a share offer on the table from QVC. But at the same time, Viacom
sharply reduced the value of the package of securities it is offering for
the remaining 49.9 per cent of Paramount's stock.
Based on Friday's stock market closing prices, traders reckon the securities
are worth some Dollars 51 to Dollars 52 a share, compared with a package of
QVC securities worth around Dollars 74 to Dollars 75.
The total cash and stock value of the Viacom bid thus stands at around
Dollars 78 a share, compared with QVC's Dollars 83 a share, and analysts
said the Viacom offer could deteriorate further today if traders marked down
its shares in reaction to Friday merger pact with Blockbuster, which came
after the stock markets closed.
The new Viacom offer, which will be considered by Paramount's board this
week, came just hours before the Friday night close of QVC's latest tender
for Paramount.
The QVC camp indicated yesterday that its tender had failed to secure the
50.1 per cent it needed for victory. Officials blamed Viacom for submitting
a last minute offer which, they argued, was not a bona fide bid higher than
QVC's, and as such should not lead to a further round of bidding.
QVC said on Friday night it believed 'the blended (cash and shares) value of
the new Viacom offer will be less than Viacom's estimates and even less than
Viacom's previous offer'. QVC officials hinted yesterday that the company
would take strong action today - presumably of a legal nature - over the
Viacom offer.
It could try to depart from the takeover timetable, which calls for rival
tender offers to close on the same date, and close its offer before Viacom's
January 21 deadline. QVC has until the market opens this morning to say
whether it is extending its bid.
Viacom said yesterday that its revised offer complied with the agreed
bidding procedures, which it claimed meant that QVC would be required to
extend its tender offer until midnight, January 21. Viacom also claimed that
its offer was superior to QVC's.
It said its revised offer increased the cash consideration to Paramount
shareholders by more than Dollars 1.1bn over its previous offer, and by more
than Dollars 800m over QVC's currrent offer.
Analysts said the five-month-old battle seemed to have a considerable way to
run, with the potential both for fresh courtroom battles and new offers.

FT  08 JAN 94 / (CORRECTED) BT price move intensifies competition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Correction (published 11th January 1994) appended to this article.
The tariff changes announced by British Telecommunications this week
intensify its fight for residential customers with Mercury and the cable
television companies. In the process, its tariff structure is becoming more
confusing than ever before.
Gone are the days of peak, standard and cheap tariffs, with calls dependent
on the time of day and the distance of the call. The main changes are as
follows:
'Option 15', introduced two years ago, gives BT customers 10 per cent off
call charges in return for a payment of Pounds 4 a quarter.
A new weekend rate, introduced last month, sharply reduced the cost of most
BT long-distance calls on Saturdays and Sundays.
A 'close ties' tariff, announced this week, will give BT customers a 5 per
cent discount on five numbers of their choice, in return for a one-off
payment of Pounds 4.99.
Mercury's policy has been to promise a reduction on BT's standard
long-distance tariffs, while mirroring most of BT's special offers. It
guarantees to undercut BT standard tariffs by 20 per cent for long-distance
UK calls made at cheap rate; by 10 per cent for international calls made at
any time; and by 10 per cent for UK long-distance calls made during peak
time.
To counter Option 15, Mercury has its own special deal for day-time callers.
For a Pounds 3 quarterly fee, customers get 15 per cent off BT basic prices
for calls made during standard and peak periods.
As for 'close ties', Mercury has launched its own 'Yourcall' scheme, which
starts in March. Mercury's version does not charge a registration fee, but,
unlike BT's scheme, is not available for local calls.
Mercury has no local network, and it charges a Pounds 10 quarterly
connection fee.
Connecting with Mercury can be done via a special phone with a blue button
in most of the country or, in those areas with digital phone exchanges, by
prefixing long-distance numbers with '132', once the user has registered
with the scheme.
The cable companies, which now boast more than 300,000 phone customers in
urban areas, almost all levy lower standing charges than BT, and guarantee
reductions on BT standard tariffs. Nynex, one of the largest UK cable
operators, charges a quarterly line rental of Pounds 16.50, against BT's
Pounds 20.16 (from next month).
Yet in some cases it is cheaper to phone long distance on Mercury using a BT
line than it is to take a cable connection.
CORRECTION
Mercury's residential connection fee is Pounds 10 a year, paid in quarterly
instalments, not Pounds 10 a quarter as stated in Saturday's FT.

Transmedia will provide restaurants with an updated list of invalid cards.
The card holder should inform Transmedia as soon as possible to expedite
this procedure.

FT  08 JAN 94 / Tokyo may act in drugs row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's ministry of health and welfare is considering disclosing its
evaluation procedure for new drugs, after the death of 20 patients who took
a cancer drug during clinical tests.
The ministry is trying to alleviate public criticism over the approval by
the Central Pharmaceutical Affairs Council last month of irinotecan
hydrochloride, a lung, uterine and ovarian cancer drug which also causes
diarrhoea and a decrease in white blood corpuscles.
From March, the Health Ministry is expected to inform hospitals and medical
associations on how it examines and evaluates new medicines during screening
and provide doctors and pharmacists with clinical data of the checks.
Ministry officials have blamed drug companies for not providing sufficient
information about new drugs, and says it wants to promote the proper use by
providing information.
Before the anti-cancer drug case, 14 people died after taking sorivudine, a
shingles drug, causing a rift between the Health Ministry, doctors and drug
companies. Ministry officials blamed doctors for failing to read warnings
against the combined use of the shingles drug with an anti-cancer agent,
while doctors criticised the ministry and the drug maker for not placing
conspicuous warnings.

FT  08 JAN 94 / As They say in Europe: Good fortune brings pain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Once 1994 got under way I felt a sense of relief. After the (largely
miserable) mass-contemplation of its advent, the new year eventually
arrived, and no new ghastly event had hit the world scene.
So I turned to the French press to see how it received a flood of good news,
as well as news of good floods. This was because, apart from meteorological
phenomena, there were a number of rather jolly events that normally might
have been expected to raise everyone's spirits, even in France.
For one thing, the FT had awarded the country's prime minister, Edouard
Balladur, the title Man of the Year. All that got, from Sud-Ouest, was a
sour rebuff: 'There is at least one point of agreement between us and our
British compatriots.' An Alsace daily remarked that although Balladur had
become the 'sacre homme de l'annee' it was in a paper which was 'hardly
francophile'.
Another bit of good news was that an 83-year old widow from the Gard, in the
deep south, had won a record FFr60m (Pounds 6.8m) on the national lottery,
the biggest sum in loto's history. Enormous interest centred on the family
of Marie-Therese Barre ('Granny' to the press) which seemed to be distilled
from some daft 1950s black comedy of the French screen.
'Granny' herself had retired years ago from her job at the salt pans of
Aigues-Mortes. Then there was her son, Jacques, 41, who is enjoying six
months paid medical leave from his job as wayside weed remover for the local
council. He had hurt his knee playing football. The daughter-in-law, Sylvie,
35, keeps the books of a small family firm. She had been the first to hear
the good news and immediately told the dowager Mme Barre to go ahead and buy
the wardrobe she wanted. 'She also wants a new TV,' said Sylvie.
'Granny told me it won't change her life,' Sylvie added menacingly. 'You
can't go shopping in a village of 5,050 inhabitants in a mink and pearl
necklace.' It was, of course, Jacques and Sylvie who went to Paris to
collect the winnings and give the press conference from their suite at the
Ritz. 'When I find myself here,' said Jacques, 'I realise that everything
has changed. It was my mother who won, but she was tired and asked me to
come. I'm sort of the head of the family.'
The joy of the media was, to say the least, confined. The Barre's local
paper, L'Independant du Midi, was particularly bitter: 'The game (Loto) is
only a supplementary tax in disguise into which millions of victims throw
themselves, and from among whom the state carefully pulls a few privileged
beings. It is certainly necessary to motivate other players, but to win such
sums means what? To escape a life that one has fashioned up to now; to move
not to a new social level but to a veritable new social planet, to lose old
friends and acquaintances, to find oneself confronted by flattery,
speculation and crooked threats . . .'
But even a real tale of crookery failed to lift the national mood. The
Burgundy wine scandal achieved little more than a few examples of savage
Schadenfreude. This uplifting tale is based on the iron rule in Burgundy
that no wine can be declassified and sold at a bargain price in order to
clear stocks.
Current economic conditions make this a powerful temptation. Any Burgundy
sold at a knock-down price arouses tremendous interest. This customarily
becomes sheer avarice among those who believe they are innocently laying
their hands on stolen goods. So it was that 750,000 bottles were sold for
FFr25 (Pounds 2.85) each on the basis that they were in fact declassified
pommard or chablis. The fraud was perpetuated because victims did not
complain for fear of exposing themselves as 'mugs'.
The wine was in fact from Languedoc and Roussillon, and the regional paper,
once again L'Independant du Midi, gloated. Its readers among local wine
growers had long been accused of faking claret and now their products had
been used in the fabrication of the more prestigious Burgundy crus. 'What a
fine revenge for the producers of the Midi,' wrote the paper. 'After all,
one lends only to the rich.'
This opaque statement reflects a typical regional attitude vis-a-vis those
who dwell in other, more privileged, regions. 'Lending' their inferior wines
to those others, and trying to swindle the rest of the country, gives
greater pleasure than a windfall of FFr60m.
The duc de la Rochefoucauld noted 300 years ago in his famous Maxims that
the misfortune of others, even friends, gives us a certain pleasure.
L'Independant proves that, and the reverse: their good fortune can cause us
some pain.

FT  08 JAN 94 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Setting the right tone
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Funnily enough, I like advertisements. This liking of adverts - peculiar in
a journalist - stems from a fondness for advertising itself, and for the men
and women, plus those in between, who work in ad agencies. What funsters
they are - witty, intelligent and able to conceal, like master magicians,
their suspicion, or conviction, that helping to sell dogfood or a twee brand
of after-shave is a ridiculous occupation for people of talent.
I used to write about the ad business for the FT, and was lucky that my
four-year stint (to 1982) coincided with prodigiously gushing ad budgets.
Those were the glory days.
I lunched and dined with the chairmen of all the brightest agencies, and
enjoyed their company greatly. They were all wealthy men; some were quite
eccentric. One of them used to pretend to himself that I was a particularly
callow youth. I expect it gave him a buzz. He always ordered my food, and
once told the waiter to cut up my steak. If I visited him at his agency he
would offer me sweet sherry.
Once, in a restaurant, he decided the time had come to explain the nature of
the relationship between agencies and their clients.
'What you need to know, Michael, is that in all practical respects, an
agency is like a knocking-shop. Just look at an agency's clients, especially
the out-of-towners - oinks in shiny suits. (I imagine he meant 'oik'; he
often muddled words.) All year, these oinks make hair-gel or catfood or
something else revolting.
'The only glamour in their lives is when they come to London to visit the
agency to see what they are getting for these enormous sums of money that
the agency is charging them. So we show them the house-reel and wine them
and dine them and pander to their needs, no matter how basic. Then back they
go to the provinces, to their grey little lives, to make some more catfood.
We whore for them, you see.'
Yes, I still enjoy advertisements. I read one the other day. It has given me
an idea. It was in The New Yorker, where the ads often out-sparkle the stuff
that keeps them apart. It was a house-ad for reader services offered by The
New Yorker itself. 'Use our convenient touch-tone phone line,' said the ad,
'to hear special messages about the quality products and services listed
below. Call toll-free from any US touch-tone phone.'
One of these products was Tilley Endurables: ''The best travel and adventure
clothing in the world': classically-styled, long-lasting, comfortable
clothes with secret pockets . . . And, of course, the Tilley Hat. The
68-page catalogue is a hoot] For your free copy, please call: 30238.'
Other products and services on offer included a sweepstake offering a trip
for two to 'fascinating Malaysia and surprising Singapore'; holiday news
from Remy Martin; and Loro Piana Italian fabrics.
This touch-tone business is clearly intended to help foster closer ties
between advertisers and their customers. Perhaps it is an old idea; if so, I
haven't noticed it. But I am attracted by its niftiness. As a result, I am
setting up a touch-tone phone operation of my own. Examples of services that
I plan to test-market:
The John Major Pre-Retirement Programme: 'Hello. This is John Major. Like
me, perhaps you are anticipating sudden retirement in the not too distant
future. If so, you will be cheered to know that there are numerous
activities to which the retired person can devote his or her energies. I
myself plan to take up train-spotting - if I can find any trains] - and
possibly home baking, just to surprise Norma. I have produced a bumper
leaflet which explains the full range of activities available to us once we
leave the world of work. If you would like one, please speak after the tone
. . .'
Norman Fowler's Practical Guide to Modern-Day Morality: 'Hello. People often
ask me how we in the Conservative Party can call, with a straight face, for
a return to family values when many of our members, some in government, have
mistresses all over the place, and other peccadilloes. I myself believe it
important not to pre-judge the issue. To keep an open mind. Yet face things
squarely. Not run and hide. If you would like to hear more, please speak
after the tone . . .'
Probably I'll make a fortune.

FT  08 JAN 94 / The FT Interview: And finally . . . coffee at the Ritz -
Trevor McDonald recalls his early days in Trinidad, his dangerous
assignments, and his rise to number one newsreader
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There was little danger of missing Trevor McDonald at our appointed meeting
place, the Ritz. For the sole anchor on ITN's News At Ten is surely the best
known black man in Britain, with the possible exception of Frank Bruno.
And the viewers love him: a recent Gallup Poll showed that the West Indian
with the clipped moustache and even more clipped delivery was streets ahead
of his nearest newscasting rival.
McDonald has just written a book about his previous life as a reporter: a
colourful tale in which he presses the flesh with everyone from Burl Ives to
Saddam Hussein; talks to Colonel Gadaffi in his tent; and chats over a snack
of iguana in the jungle with Daniel Ortega. On one assignment he has a
submachinegun thrust in his belly; on another, he wins the toss to be the
first journalist to interview Nelson Mandela after his 27 years in prison.
In spite of all this, the reason for his fame is his presence in the blue
neon ITN 'spaceship' five evenings a week, reading words from an autocue to
up to 7m viewers. Does he think so much fame is justified for doing so
little?
'It is easy to say 'how silly'. But on the other hand people want to watch
someone they feel comfortable with.'
To hear him talk about it, the job sounds a piece of cake: 'You have to read
well, and construct your sentences clearly.'
But if it's that easy, why are some newscasters so much more popular than
others? 'I don't understand it, but I'm glad it's me they like,' he says,
then adding after a pause for thought: 'It's like reading for the Royal
Shakespeare Company - you use all the same tricks.'
McDonald refers to the English classics with a frequency that is most
un-English. Indeed he speaks an archaic language all his own, sprinkling
otherwise plain speech with quotes from Tennyson and words such as
'interlocutor' and 'ineluctable'.
He confesses he is beginning to find his own fame a little frightening: 'A
lady came up to me in the supermarket the other day and told me that a few
days before she had seen me cross the road against the lights. Her little
girl said: 'That newsman has broken the law. We must stop watching the news
if he behaves like that.''
But far from looking frightened, he seems amused. He appears to be wearing
his fame well, liking the attention, yet not letting it turn his head. 'You
are built up to be greater than you are,' he says, modestly.
One of the things that may explain his popularity as a newscaster is that he
comes across as a decent bloke. His book is riddled with examples of his
sunny view of the human condition.
But despite his optimism, McDonald is not a Good News man. Indeed he regards
the campaign by his BBC counterpart, Martyn Lewis for less gloom and doom on
the box as puerile. 'It is so far off the agenda of what journalism is
about, that I get worried. The function of journalists is to tell what is
going on. Not to be social engineers.'
He argues that the debate stems from a fallacy. 'It is a mistake that the
media abhors good news. Some of the biggest money we have spent at ITN
recently has been on the collapse of the Berlin Wall and the transformation
in South Africa. When there is good news we go overboard. I would love more
apple pie. More lunches at the Ritz, more champagne for everyone. But life
isn't like that.'
For McDonald himself, life these days is a little like that. As he sits in
his perfect business suit politely asking the waiter for fresh orange juice
and black coffee you would think he had been born at the Ritz rather than in
Trinidad.
McDonald presents his Caribbean childhood as poor but happy, with a beloved
father who made shoes to pay for his children's education. 'I really adored
my father. He was an educator, disciplinarian, friend, counsellor and
drinking buddy. He was not formally educated, but he had an extraordinary
view of what was necessary to succeed. He always said: whether you are a
doctor, a lawyer or a dustman, you have to strive.'
The day his father died McDonald was in Moscow. He recalls how strings were
pulled by one of Gorbachev's assistants to get him on the next flight home.
'My father would have been so proud that his name was uttered in the
corridors of power at the Kremlin,' he says.
Although he is proud of his roots, McDonald is low key about being West
Indian in Britain. He claims he has never been discriminated against - his
colour has neither helped nor hindered his rise: 'Racism is not as prevalent
in the media as on the milkround.'
Characteristically, he is upbeat about race relations in Britain. 'This is a
multi-racial society. Nothing on God's earth will change it. It is
ineluctable, irrevocable. People will learn to adjust.'
But surely politicians can do something to help the process? McDonald
agrees, hinting that the Conservative government is making matters worse. He
deplores those politicians 'who stand up at party conferences making
speeches for cheap laughs in which they say that they understand the fear of
communities being swamped'. He argues that a simple declaration from the
government of its intention to improve race relations would in itself do
much good.
I wonder whether he couldn't do a little more himself to help blacks in this
country. He looks a bit uncomfortable. 'I visit schools a lot.'
He pauses and corrects himself: 'To be very honest I don't do it a lot, but
whenever I can.'
The question seems to have hit a sensitive spot: 'I could have done more,
but have not had the time. With all the travelling, and trying to keep up
the pretence of being a father and a husband, it is not always very easy . .

FT  08 JAN 94 / Faith makes Durham fizz: Hugh Dickinson finds David Jenkins
the most exciting and stimulating bishop
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH DICKINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The timing was perfect. Try putting a bomb under the angels and shepherds in
July and it would not even make the Parish Mag. But here we are at Epiphany
and all the world knows that a senior bishop of the Church of England has
taken a pot shot at the three wise men. (These mysterious magi arrived at
Bethlehem on Twelfth Night. Um, or didn't)
The Durham affair has had a splendid run. It was headline news for two days
in both BBC and ITN The Radio 4 programme, The Moral Maze, devoted a whole
bad-tempered hour to it. MPs and peers pontificated disapprovingly. Fellow
Bishops sighed. Evangelical clerics railed. The tabloids and the broadsheets
devoted column after column to it. Leader writers said the faithless Bishop
was a prime cause of the loss of nerve and decline in the Church of England.
It is odd that no-one defended David Jenkins. Very odd indeed. For I have
frequently sat in packed halls and churches listening to him hold his
audiences enthralled.
Let me state boldly that he is the most exciting, stimulating and
faith-enhancing Bishop on the Bench. Who was it who held a sixth-form
conference of 300 young people spellbound for an hour after their allotted
period was supposed to be over? Who was it who (so the rumour goes) brought
the House of Bishops to their feet in a standing ovation after an
impassioned speech about faith? Who has had the courage and integrity to
share with Christian lay-people the conclusions of a century of Christian
scholarship which are taught as a matter of course to the majority of
theology students?
Right. David Jenkins.
Here in Salisbury (hardly the heartland of liberal scepticism) he received
tumultuous applause from a packed Cathedral after a profound and moving
lecture last summer. I know lay and ordained men and women who would say
that the Christian faith has only been made believable for them by people
such as David Jenkins and others who have dared to be truthful about Gospel
Truth.
So it is odd that the media presents an image of an academic noddy, a dried
up, liberal sceptic, when he is in reality a dynamic and profoundly
believing Christian man with a faith that is both generous and contagious.
How can such a mismatch come about? Well, nothing is so much fun as seeing
high-minded religious people at each other's throats. But in this case there
is a real and profoundly felt disagreement between two kinds of believing.
There is script faith and seed faith. Each views the other with deep (but
Christian) hostility and distrust. There are lots of illiberal and
fundamentalist clergy and laity who feel the truth of Scripture is betrayed
by the kind of faith which makes David Jenkins fizz.
His seed faith is open, questioning and undogmatic. It focuses on the
central core of belief. It is willing to suspend judgment on historical
authenticity; it treasures myths which fire the imagination. It distrusts
static formulae; it asks people to think for themselves, to respond from the
heart to whatever speaks to the heart.
It does not seek to control or manipulate. It believes that God is
ultimately mysterious.
For Scripture is not script. It is a kaleidoscope of historical facts,
poetry, metaphor and myth which holds truths at many different levels, but
all pointing to the claim that God was at work in Jesus.
For the Bishop's critics, by contrast, faith is a construct of authoritative
texts, statements of belief and traditional teachings. It is a complete
package. To pick and choose would be to set your own fallible judgment
against the Word of God.
If the Bible says the angels burst into song over Bethlehem, then you have
to believe that a tape-recorder would have picked up the tune. If it says
Jesus converted 120 gallons of water into wine, then Chateau Lafite it was.
Allow one stitch to be unpicked and the whole thing will unravel.
Behind this kind of belief is a longing for certainty and a desire for
authority. And it is effective. There is a resonance between a public which
longs for security and an end to doubt, and powerful and dogmatic
personalities who are only too happy to offer it.
It has simplicity, clarity and power. All over the world fundamentalist and
conservative religions are making converts. People's lives are being
changed. Energies are being channeled in programmes, fatwahs, jehads,
crusades and missions. Liberals are demonised, along with the new age, yoga,
and socialism.
By its nature script belief is highly sympathetic to right-wing politics and
hostile to causes such as equal rights.
By contrast seed belief seems vague, equivocal and woolly. It distrusts the
techniques of mass persuasion.
It refuses to offer factitious certainties to the vulnerable and uncertain.
To children and the simple-minded it seems hesitant and confusing. And yet
for many people who dislike the dogmatism of script belief it offers a way
of believing which treasures intellectual integrity and recognises that
truth is many-layered.
But given that believers do divide into these two opposing camps, how is it
that all the nobs and commentators are so hostile to the Bishop of Durham?
Is our society deeply authoritarian? Do we do not want people to think for
themselves?
To my mind it is patronising and offensive to suggest that Christian lay
people should not be told the conclusions of 100 years of theological
scholarship. It is like saying: Don't tell them the earth is round; they'll
all be terrified of falling off.
Many more would be Christians if they did not have to believe in
unbelievable accessories, because then they could hang on to the simplest
and most cogent formula I know: God is. As he is in Jesus. Therefore we have
hope.
That is what David Jenkins is saying.
Hugh Dickinson is Dean of Salisbury

FT  08 JAN 94 / Arts: Recital of the fin-de-siecle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One would have thought the arrival of a new millennium would be something to
sing about. As the close of the 19th century a wealth of composers, such as
Strauss and Wolf, Schoenberg and Berg, were producing songs for the new
century - a level of activity that we show no sign of equalling as the year
2000 approaches.
Half the art of giving a successful song recital comes in planning the
programme. For her Wigmore Hall recital on Thursday Joan Rodgers turned
exclusively to that rich period, 1885-1905. This also had the advantage of
drawing her away from the Mozartian era for which she is known in opera. How
would a favourite Susanna, Zerlina and Pamina fare as she ventured into
decadent turn-of-the-century Vienna?
The first thing to say is that she has not forgotten where she has come
from. When she sings Mozart, Joan Rodgers has impressed audiences with a
classical poise and purity of voice, though the sound is warmer than it was
and has lost some of its ease above the stave. What remains special is the
beauty of tone lower down, allied to a care over phrasing, rhythms,
consonants that marks a singer of distinction.
All these are important attributes, just as much in the music of Wolf and
Berg. It is good to hear a recitalist really sing in Wolf, giving the vocal
lines the musical eloquence they deserve. Rodgers was touching in any song
where the singing came first ('An den Schlaf' radiant, 'Das verlassene
Magdlein' haunting) but made little of songs in which the words should lead
the way. In Berg's Seven Early Songs, a favourite with Wagnerians, her
Mozartian elegance and precision made a welcome change, but these were again
seven of the same.
The sense of a true Lieder singer at work only fully came through with the
Strauss songs. Perhaps Roger Vignoles, ever the supportive accompanist,
encouraged a stronger contrast of mood, as the words suddenly started to
communicate specific emotions. 'Allerseelen' managed to be delicate, but
still suggest deep feeling. The ingenuousness of a Sophie, the mature
sentiment of a Marschallin were held nicely in balance.
Everywhere there was tact, a quality all too often foreign to singers who
take up Schoenberg's Cabaret Songs. If anything, these were under-sold,
where a hardened recitalist would be hawking their humour and catchy tunes
to rake in the applause for the end of the evening. In the song about the
cat, Rodgers was a kitten next to the audience-devouring tigress of Jessye
Norman, who also gave us Schoenberg in London recently.
To end on a note of unqualified delight: the first encore, Tchaikovsky's
'None but the lonely heart', was sheer beauty, understatement at its most
moving, every shading of colour and emphasis perfectly judged. It is time
that one of the British opera companies invite her to visit as Tchaikovsky's
Tatyana.

FT  08 JAN 94 / Arts: Opera casts its net back - Records
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
About 20 years ago my local library moved into new premises and took what
then seemed the ambitious step of opening a record section. The objective
was not to make money by charging, as it is now. The expansion of the
library's services was simply an invitation to its readers to broaden their
interests.
As no payment was required, anyone could afford to be adventurous. Why I
borrowed a boxed set of LPs entitled Stars of the Old Vic and Sadler's Wells
I do not now remember. Most of the singers would have been unknown to me and
I had never been to the opera at either the Old Vic or Sadler's Wells. The
records had to be returned within a fortnight, but there was one group of
performances in that collection so exciting that it has stayed fresh in my
mind ever since.
The set concluded with a selection of excerpts from Britten's Peter Grimes,
performed by the original cast soon after the opera's premiere, in 1948. For
some reason they had never been issued at the time and EMI had decided to
use them to illustrate a high-point in the history of the Sadler's Wells
company. Now they are back, superly re-mastered, in excellent sound, as part
of a two-CD box of historic Britten recordings which unearthes still more
rare treasures, a tempting proposition.
No] - it is more than that. The Peter Grimes excerpts are essential
listening for anybody interested in the opera. Hearing them again, one
realises why this opera blew through the British musical world like an
East-coast gale. The music has a biting edge, the drama a chill realism, by
the side of which performances today all too often sound warm and
comfortable. No other singer surpasses Peter Pears's intensity in the mad
scene, unhinged and wild, frightening to hear. It is also good to have
preserved on disc Reginald Goodall, the original conductor, and Joan Cross,
Britten's chosen Ellen Orford, who died aged 93 just before Christmas. The
rest of the set has substantial excerpts from The Rape of Lucretia made in
1947 (not, alas, with Kathleen Ferrier) and early recordings of Britten
folksongs. Six tracks, including some of the Peter Grimes, are appearing for
the first time.
EMI's set of Donizetti's Anna Bolena will also be new to many people. This
release bestows a certain legality upon what used to be a pirate recording,
though the sound quality unfortunately remains very poor, subject to sudden
outbreaks of twittering, which I take to be interference in the radio
reception. This is the price we have to pay to hear Maria Callas in the
title-role, live at La Scala, Milan, 1957, at the very height of her career.
The whole of the final scene, sung with infinite variety of colour, is an
object-lesson in bel canto singing, every line with something to say. There
are also live recordings of Callas in Bellini's Il pirata and Verdi's
Macbeth.
The set devoted to another prima donna from the 1960s - Regine Crespin  -
does not offer enlightenment on such a consistent level, but is a welcome
collectors' item. Crespin's voice and style of singing have been described
as 'addictive', which seems to me apt. There are unsuccessful performances
here - a deadly slow Schumann Liederkreis Op. 39 is one - but, as with
Callas, this is a truly personal singer, imaginative, moving, memorable. A
shame that Decca, which holds her best recordings, has not issued a similar
retrospective.
That company's main operatic release this winter had one eye on the future.
Ever since Luciano Pavarotti signed an exclusive contract near the start of
his career, Decca has been building up its recordings of the tenor's main
operatic roles (prime material for future re-release, long after the singer
himself has retired). As his repertoire is relatively small, there is not
much to go, but Puccini's Manon Lescaut is a new addition, which Pavarotti
sings with all his customary beauty of voice. Mirella Freni, with whom as a
child he shared a wet nurse, sounds less well preserved. Decca's recording
is brash and James Levine conducts with relentless passion, loving the music
to death.
It is interesting to speculate which recordings from today will be accorded
historic importance in the next century. Individual stars, like Pavarotti,
will certainly have a place, but how shall we look back on the authentic
instrument movement, if it continues to progress and change at the present
rate? Even the most advanced performances, in terms of research and period
accuracy, might soon sound out-of-date.
If any present recordings retain their importance, John Eliot Gardiner's
cycle of the Mozart operas will surely be among them. This series sums up
all that is best about the movement in general. His new set of Cos fan tutte
is thoughtfully cast, immaculately - nay, astonishingly - precise in every
technical detail, considering it was made at a live performance. Gardiner
has a reputation for ruling his singers and orchestra with a rod of iron.
And it shows.
Of the three Da Ponte comedies, on which he is now engaged, none sparkles as
a result of technical brilliance more brightly than Cos fan tutte. The trios
and quintets of the first act are so clear that an average music student
could sit down and write out the parts without any need to hear the music
again - assuming, that is, he could keep up with Gardiner's speeds. One
imagines long hours of rehearsal, in which the conductor went over each
passage time and time again until every little phrase was balanced as he
wanted it. Single-mindedness can be a virtue in a conductor.
It is a feature of the performance that the six solo singers should form an
obedient ensemble. Anybody who has a favourite old recording in which the
singers flaunt their personalities (Montserrat Caballe and Janet Baker, for
example) may feel cheated at the comparatively pale portrayals here, in
which blending of voices rather than individuality is the prime requirement.
Nevertheless, Amanda Roocroft and Rosa Mannion as the two sisters, Rainer
Trost and Rodney Gilfry as their lovers, contribute some beautiful singing,
the soprano and tenor especially. Eirian James is the Despina with a
surprise baritone register, Carlos Feller the Don Alfonso. Gardiner could
not achieve his high standards without colleagues as skilled as these.

Productions of The Nutcracker come and go. Mostly they do not go soon
enough, and among the tribulations of the festive season - like hideous
Christmas cards from forgotten relations - are those misbegotten stagings
with which innocent children are introduced to 'the ballet'.
English National Ballet's version by Ben Stevenson, brought among us two
years ago, has won few plaudits from me. Its party scene is a rough and
tumble in which tots are given alcohol, an old man falls over several times,
and small boys behave like miniature terrorists: true to life, no doubt, but
no fun to watch on stage. Much of the dramatic signposting in the score is
crassly ignored. Later scenes are somewhat better, though much infested with
child performers. What virtues the affair possesses are owed to Desmond
Heeley's designs (which just manage not to go over the top in seasonal
winsomeness) and, this year, to the disciplined and buoyant dancing of the
company - the fruit of Derek Deane's policies after less than a year as
artistic director.
I saw the piece on Wednesday evening, and was content to sit through the
early mayhem because of the promise of Yelena Pankova and Thomas Edur in the
grand pas de deux. Pankova remains the enchanting ballerina we knew with the
Kirov. Her dancing is as light as ever, frosted and sweet as a Sugar Plum
should be, and unfailingly charming. I wish the version of the pas de deux
were better, but Pankova persuaded me at moments that it was real
choreography. So did Edur, with his aristocratic manner, the lift and
clarity of his style, and the beautiful quietness - that absence of vain
display and empty bravura - which touches his grandest, most serious moments
as a dancer. He also partnered Susan Jaffe, very secure and polished, in the
snow scene, both of them giving its ice-skating curlicues something like
academic seemliness.
For the rest, I salute the corps de ballet, who appeared strong and sure of
themselves, and note that Philip Arrona's Drosselmeyer looks very like
Talleyrand. I could not, though, take myself to this version unprepared, and
on Monday night I went to Covent Garden to be reminded by the Royal Ballet's
wise and sensitive staging of what a Nutcracker should be. Here sentiment,
and the musical aptness of the dance, are paramount attractions - and the
choreography does not insult its players. I saw Miyako Yoshida as the Sugar
Plum, clear and bright in step, and Tetsuya Kumakawa as her cavalier,
cutting astonishing shapes in the air. But it was Stephen Jefferies as
Drosselmeyer who made the evening glorious.
Jefferies, as we have known for 20 years, is a dance-actor expressive,
original, profound. He made Drosselmeyer a contemplative, almost melancholy
figure, at once mysterious and benign. The entire action seemed to spring
from his will, and he moved through it as a truly Hoffmannesque figure. In
its concentration, its dignity and commanding intelligence, this reading
rivalled anything I have seen Jefferies do throughout his career - even his
tremendous Rudolf in Mayerling. Such artistry speaks of theatrical genius:
we are privileged to watch him.
The Nutcracker continues at the Royal Festival Hall until January 22.

FT  08 JAN 94 / Arts: Film-makers baptised in fire - Nigel Andrews talks to
director Chen Kaige about the true cultural revolution going on in China
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
We know how an individual recovers from a nightmare. He wakes up, turns on
the bedside light, stares round at comforting reality: soon the horrors
start to disperse. But how does a nation recover - especially from a
nightmare that began as a dream?
'I really believed in Mao a long time ago,' says film-maker Chen Kaige,
whose Cannes Golden Palm-winning epic of Chinese history Farewell My
Concubine opened in Britain this week. 'Everybody did. We had no other
reference points to the outside world. We had never been out of China. We
believed in communism like Nature.'
And they believed right up to, and into, the Cultural Revolution. Like any
nightmare, though, this one finally got bad enough to wake everyone up.
Farewell My Concubine's half-century-spanning story of two rival Peking
Opera actors ends in 1977, after the Gang of Four were arrested and the CR
reached official fade-out. But the horror of that period gives Chen's film
its dramatic last act, shock-punctuated with betrayals, arrests, show trials
and summary deaths. And in men like Chen himself, Zhang Yimou (Raise The Red
Lantern) and Tian Zhuangzhuang (Horse Thief) China's agonies have given
China a generation of film-makers, baptised in fire, who have become the
greatest and bravest in its history.
Chen's debut feature Yellow Earth (1984) began it all. It was the first
Chinese film anyone could remember that portrayed real people in real,
remote landscapes. 'The land where we shot the film,' he says, 'was the
birthplace of so-called 'Chinese civilisation.' And incidentally of the
Communist party. Yet cameras had almost never been there before. When I got
there I was shocked. People were very quiet, very guarded, very austere. Yet
reading their faces was like reading Chinese history.'
Before Chen made Yellow Earth, the country's cinema had alternated
big-screen melodramas - love and betrayal amid the cherry blossoms - with
march-and-sing propaganda film bearing titles like 'Heroic Red Women Save
The Jute Factory.' Farewell My Concubine wryly invokes both traditions. It
is melodramatic; and it does allude, paradoxically, to the propagandist
pageantry of Maoist cinema. But like all Chen's work - The Big Parade, Life
On A String - Farewell takes the scenic route to enlightenment. It gives the
devil his photogenic due before rendezvousing with truth, sense and freedom.
It also counterpoints the public dream of Maoism with the private dreams of
its unheroic 'hero.' A gay Peking Opera actor who plays the Queen on stage
to his rival and idol's King, he suffers not just for his art but for his
homosexuality. 'He's the guy who cannot make a difference between real life
and life on stage,' Chen says. 'He's a beautiful dreamer, he lives like ET.'
ET?
'Yes, he comes from another planet. He cannot get on with ordinary people.
He lives in his art, and finally he sacrifices himself for his art.'
But why set that sacrifice in 1977 - surely the year of hope and
emancipation for China? 'This man belonged to the old times. Farewell My
Concubine is not just a political story, it's an artistic one. He was coming
into a new age where he knew he would not belong. He would not be useful or
comfortable.
'Today Chinese Opera is dying. The government tries to play patron, but it
doesn't work. The life style on which Opera is based is gone. We used to be
very close as a community, the Chinese people. Where I lived, I could hear
the people curse in the next room. We'd say 'Hello' to each other every
morning. It's not the same in modern-day China. In the old days you could
ring an Opera troupe and say, 'Lets have a performance in the courtyard]'
'Peking Opera was an amazing form, so dedicated, and so enclosed] If you
talk to old performers as I did, you find they knew nothing about the
outside world or politics. But when they talk about Opera their eyes and
faces come alight. They're dreamers, like my hero.'
But experienced dreamers also know when a dream is ending. Killing himself
on stage in the film's last scene, perhaps Chen's hero senses the distant
shadow of Tiananmen Square, reaching out to choke the hopes of those who
believed that tyranny might have vanished with Mao. For Chen it has never
vanished. His recent films were made with non-Chinese finance and initially
banned in China. Yet he and his contemporaries have gone on making films
that hammer against the walls of silence and intolerance in their country,
walls raised during the 25 years of Mao's rule.
'Maoism was a beautiful dream of establishing a new world, a new society. We
all tried to believe in it. And we did believe in it, up until the Cultural
Revolution.
'What you see in Farewell about that period is true. People started to
denounce and betray each other. I denounced my own father when I was 14. He
was accused of being a secret agent for the Kuo-Min-Tang (Chinese
Nationalists). It wasn't true. But the point is, people lived in fear. Fear
of being kicked out from society. So to stay in society they needed to
denounce other people to prove their loyalty. That's how Mao ran the
country.'
Now a quarter century after Mao let 'a thousand flowers bloom,' in order to
search out and cut down the nonconformist shoots, a band of cinematic
survivors has created something like a true cultural revolution. Last year
Chinese film-makers were the most prolific prize-winners on the festival
circuit, snapping up the Golden Lion/Bear/Palm consecutively at Venice,
Berlin and Cannes.
'There was one very emotional moment in Cannes,' says Chen. 'An American
journalist asked me, 'You young film-makers in China have made such great
progress, how do you feel about this?' The answer is, we have been working
towards this for ten years] I was very emotional, I almost cried. Only I and
other young directors know how difficult it has been. You have to fight
enemies you don't even know; you're attacked from every direction. That is
why as a generation we are pretty strong. I'm sad to say it, but we are
strong.'

FT  08 JAN 94 / Arts: Drawn in the manner of Haarlem - Patricia Morison
enjoys Amsterdam's 'The Dawn of the Golden Age' exhibition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unwary people could be fooled by the Rijksmuseum's cunningly chosen poster
for its stupendous and extremely costly new exhibition. They will catch
sight of baby Catharina Hooft and her nurse, an enchanting portrait painted
in 1620 by Frans Hals, and think, 'Ah, Hals] And that of course means the
Dutch Golden Age, Rembrandt, Cuyp, Vermeer, Jan Steen, and so on.'
In fact, Hals is the bait to lure the public to an experience which is
surely vastly more rewarding. Dawn of the Golden Age is a beautifully
designed and magisterial survey of the visual arts in the north Netherlands
between 1580 and 1620. So far as I know, no museum has ever made such an
ambitious commitment to the art of this complex and absurdly neglected
period. A marathon show, it demands a far longer visit than the press were
allowed. So allow at least a day for it, and if this period of Dutch art is
a blank on your cultural map, try beforehand to browse in the well-written
catalogue, a massive Thames and Hudson production.
Sixteen galleries are elegantly arranged with just about anything a Dutch
nobleman or burgher could have aspired to, around 1600; 160 paintings and
drawings, prints, sculpture, glass, silver, calligraphy, furniture, armour,
and superb tapestries. Two-thirds of the exhibits are loans, brought from
all over the world. Curious rarities include a needlework 'painting', an
extremely rare survival of a large woodcut of the Mocking of Christ such as
humble people pinned to their walls and, at the other end of the social
scale, unique example of a gauzey, Frenchified ruff.
Dutch craftsmanship was worth waiting for. A tapestry caparison for a parade
horse was made by the famous Spiering workshop for the coronation of
Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden, but delivered years late. Francois Spiering was
a refugee from Antwerp. Many other artists in the exhibition were Flemish
Protestant refugees; the under-appreciated genius Jacques de Gheyn II,
theorist and painter Karel van Mander, Hans Bol who made miniature
townscapes popular, and Paschier Lammertijn, king of damask. What we think
of as the Dutchness of Dutch art was directly dependent on the impact of men
who had learned their trades in the highly specialised workshops of the
south.
There are many pointers to the bloody struggle for independence from
Catholic Spain. There is Hendrick de Keyser's model for the tomb of William
the Silent, and a superb gold tazza engraved with the scene showing the
wiley ruse which brought to an end the siege of Breda. Dutch towns were
fiercely proud and rapidly growing extremely rich. Many beautiful things in
the exhibition were commissioned by the towns as propaganda. Heroic failure
was no less worthy of record, as shown by quite one of my favourite
exhibits, an enormous tapestry which shows a naval disaster, from a series
commissioned by the States of Zeeland.
Few painters of the Dutch dawn are widely popular today - perhaps only Hals
and Avercamp, the mute who specialised in skating scenes. The giant of the
exhibition is the painter and engraver Hendrick Goltzius (1558-1617), a
dazzlingly and protean talent. Other leading masters of their day were
Cornelis Cornelisz, Abraham Bloemaert, Joachim Wtewael, and Pieter Lastman,
the history painter who for six months taught Rembrandt.
Rarely do Old Master exhibitions strike such an instant blow to the visual
nerves as the first room with Bloemaert's 'Death of Niobe's Children' (from
Copenhagen), Cornelisz's 'Battle of the Titans', Goltzius's 'Massacre of the
Innocents' and Wtewael's 'Deluge'. In the late 1580s and '90s, this group of
Haarlem artists were in thrall to the engravings of the well-travelled
Bartholomaeus Spranger, such as the famous 'Marriage of Cupid and Psyche'.
From their paintings, prints and drawings, it is clear to see how intensely
competitive these Haarlem Mannerists were. As Karel van Mander urged them,
Flemish artists had to show the Italians that they had caught up. They, too,
had drunk from the wisdom of the ancients. It was their turn to show that
they could not only represent the idealised nude with the skill of a
Michelangelo but show it performing terrifying gymnastics in incredibly
complex compositions.
Dutch Mannerism around 1600 repulses many people for being so frantic and
exaggerated. Artists were fascinated by the erotic, including incest and
homoeroticism, by violence and disasters, by the monstrous and irrational.
(Look at Jacques de Gheyn's witches, his almost human frogs, and the
repulsive little bronze monsters designed by Arent van Bolten.) Or could it
be that taste this century is tending in a direction similar enough to make
us receptive to even the wildest visions of the Mannerists?
Haarlem mannerism in painting is not everyone's taste. But anyone who likes
Art Nouveau must surely love the silversmiths, Adam van Vianen and his
brother, Paulus, goldsmith to Rudolf II in Prague. Their pieces in
auricular, ear-shaped style, make silver seem hardly more solid than whipped
cream. Ewers and goblets swirl biliously, giving fleetingly glimpses of
women, parts of the body, and grotesques.
If this seems a little unwholesome to fit your idea of Dutch art, be
reassured that there are more straight-forward delights, such as the early
landscapes, still-lives, flower-paintings, and the hilarious military
fashion-plates by Jacques de Gheyn. I particularly enjoyed the 'friendship
books' kept by several artists. As animal artists, Goltzius and Jacques de
Gheyn can hold a candle to Durer.
Again and again, the genius of Goltzius has one open-mouthed in admiration.
His pen-drawings in imitation of engravings are incredible, technical
show-offs which nonetheless have real beauty. Just see the merriment of the
'Boy with a Skull and a Tulip'. Marvel, too, at the 'Study of a Right Hand'.
Those three visble fingers look deformed. Is this Goltzius' right hand which
van Mander said was badly burnt, or is it simply 'by the hand of Goltzius'?
do not miss this wonderful chance to look at Dutch art in its cradle.
On cultural events being mounted as part of the Golden Age of Amsterdam
festival, contact VVV Amsterdam Tourist Office, 06-340- 34066. Dawn of the
Golden Age is sponsored by Unilever. The exhibition runs until March 6;
advance tickets can be purchased from Netherlands Reservation Centre, PO Box

FT  08 JAN 94 / Arts: Arts Council off the hook - Off the Wall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A month ago the Arts Council seemed to be one British institution going
rapidly down the plug hole. I now confidently forecast a future for the
Council of serene stability: its crisis is over. This is only partly because
of the arrival in April of a tough new chairman, Lord Gowrie, who knows his
way around politics and would not have taken on the job without certain
guarantees.
The main reason for feeling sanguine is that the Council now has few
opportunities to beat itself up. It is a small irony that, during a
Conservative government, the Arts Council has become excessively dirigiste.
The most obvious example is the four London orchestras. Instead of letting
market forces decide which should prosper, the Council tried to impose a
solution, with the well known baleful results. But also in modern dance, the
regional theatre, and the visual arts the Council has attempted to know
better than the consumer. Now, with the one exception of a joint review,
with the BBC, into the regional orchestras, the Council plans few major
initiatives that seem certain to explode in its face.
An era of indolence goes hand in hand with the hope that the organisational
turmoil in the arts, and the Arts Council, is over. In a few weeks the
Council will announce around 30 redundancies as it cuts Pounds 600,000 from
its administrative costs as part of an efficiency drive forced on it by
Peter Brooke, the heritage minister. After that the Council is supposed to
be in perfect shape.
It is the same with the Regional Arts Boards. On April 1 they take on more,
and bigger, clients devolved from the Arts Council, and the new grass roots
structure of the arts in England finally falls into place. Only a lunatic
would suggest another major review or strategy document on the arts.
There is one other factor which should give the Council confidence. While
Peter Brooke protected the rest of his empire in the November Budget he cut
the grant to the Arts Council by Pounds 3.2m, the first ever reduction in
its revenue. But this was only politics. The Treasury felt that the Council
had been over-generously endowed by David Mellor. The cut was a small slap
on the wrist to put the Council in its place. Next autumn, when the 1995-96
grants are announced, the Council can anticipate a reasonable rise in
revenue.
If things look brighter for the Council it is far from certain that its
secretary-general, Anthony Everitt, will have his contract renewed at year's
end. When Lord Palumbo arrived as chairman, with a blueprint for devolution
and a slimmed down Council, it so appalled the then secretary-general, Luke
Rittner, that he resigned. His deputy, Everitt, went along with Palumbo and
stepped up to the top job. Rittner is close to Lord Gowrie. Indeed when
Gowrie was chairman at Sotheby's he brought in Rittner to head the marketing
team. Old scores could be settled.
Apart from a love of the arts Lord Gowrie was keen to chair the Arts Council
because in a year's time it becomes a much bigger challenge. The Council
will distribute Lottery money to the arts which will transform the cultural
scene in the UK. The first trickle of the gold rush might emerge in January
1995.
Ministers originally played down the size of the cash flow. Of course it
depends upon the betting instincts of the British, but early estimates of
Pounds 70m a year for the arts (with the same amounts going to heritage,
sport, charities and the Millennium Fund) look over-cautious. Now the
whisper is that the arts could eventually be Pounds 200m a year better off.
The money is intended to go on capital projects - a better heating system
for the National Theatre, for example, or improved dressing rooms at Covent
Garden - rather than boosting annual subsidy, but improved facilities can
have a direct effect in bringing down running costs and increasing box
office revenue.
For one object of national importance it looks as if the Lottery has already
arrived as saviour. The Three Graces, the classical sculpture Canova made
for the Duke of Bedford in the early 19th century, was bought by the Getty
Museum of Malibu, California, for Pounds 7.9m. But an export licence has
been refused.
Last month Peter Brooke announced that he was consulting the museums and the
art market as to whether, in exceptional circumstances, an export block
should not last for 18 months instead of the more typical three months. If
the soundings support the idea, then the Three Graces will still be in the
UK in the spring of 1995. The V&amp;A can launch another appeal to acquire it
and the government gain general kudos when, thanks to Lottery money, it
stays in the UK.
The Lottery seems so wonderful that it is bound to be a disappointment.
Apart from a mad scramble by applicants for its largesse, one worrying
aspect has emerged. The Millennium Fund was supposed to leave the nation
with a legacy of great cultural monuments for the 21st century - a Welsh
Opera House in Cardiff; a National Gallery of Scottish Art; a Tate Gallery
of Modern Art; a revamped Royal Opera House, etc. But now it seems that the
money can also be spent on general building projects, like an Embankment
Underpass from Westminster to the City. Such an undertaking might make life
in the capital sweeter, but it hardly counts as a heritage gain.

FT  08 JAN 94 / Arts: Dancing with the wind - Joan Acocela explains 'Butoh'
and the work of Eiko and Koma
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOAN ACOCELA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Practitioners of Butoh, the 'dance of darkness' that arose out of the rubble
of postwar Japan, periodically tour the US, their naked, twisted bodies
moving with infinite slowness in an atmosphere of unnamed anguish. American
audiences tend to view these performances with awed respect. At the same
time, Butoh shows often have a certain gun-to-the-head quality as if, were
you to prefer something else - something with music, something with clothes,
on your night out - this would prove you a person of low character.
Eiko and Koma, a Japanese husband-and-wife team, received their early
training form Butoh masters, and they have much in common with Butoh. They
are primitivist; they are slow; their limb sockets look as though they have
been rearranged. But Eiko (the woman) and Koma (the man) are so riveting
that, in watching them, you forget to say to yourself: 'This is good for
me.'
Eiko and Koma are both in their 40s. They met at the University of Tokyo
where they were studying law and political science, and moved to the US in
1976. They generally give one show a year in New York, and the shows are
much the same. The title is usually organic - past works include Grain,
Night Tide, Tree, Rust, Land - and the element named is often part of the
show. The couple has done whole dances in pools of water and piles of
leaves. What the dance involves is some exceedingly slow transaction - for
example, Eiko and Koma move toward one another, reach one another, then
part. Basically, the organism reaches for the thing it needs.
Nothing could be more natural and, as their titles indicate, these shows are
about nature. But by virtue of the extreme slowness and detail of the
movement, and also the dislocations of the body - at times you do not know
what is an arm, what is a leg - all is translated into a luminous
unnaturalness, in which the smallest action carries a huge rhetorical force.
This is Eiko and Koma's formula. They never change it; they never cheapen
it. Actually, they have altered it a bit recently. With the collaboration of
the American Indian composer Robert Mirabal they have begun using music in a
more conventional way. And whereas before, all their work was performed by
them alone, their last two shows have included their son Yuta Otake. He is
only eight, but he too can now move in slow motion.
Eiko and Koma's most recent piece, Wind, had its New York premiere in
December at the Joyce Theater. No, it does not use wind machines. Instead,
feathers fall slowly, two or three at a time, onto the stage, and as they
float and twist in the air, the air becomes an actor in the drama.
Meanwhile, below, the dance takes the form of passages: first Koma, then
Eiko cross the stage and vanish, their spirits presumably carried away in
the air. At the end, Yuta is left on the stage, seemingly dead. But at the
very last moment, he begins to move. He is being born, or reborn.
In the middle of the piece, there is a blackout, and when the lights go on
again, we see a tang1ed blob on the stage. It is Eiko and Xoma, naked,
locked in an embrace. But like all sex scenes in their work, this one is
sexy only in a rather dire way. At one point Eiko, lying on her side, arches
her body into the air. We see her whole trunk - full frontal nudity. But it
does not look like a nude woman. It looks like a sting ray, or a bearded
face, or God knows what. And that is the force of Eiko and Koma's work: to
use only the body, but generalise it, so that it becomes Nature, and make it
strange, so that it becomes theater.
Koma is the more poignant of the two. He is humanity, struggling. As for
Eiko, her face is a mask, her every limb-rotation an eerie drama. She seems
to have died and returned. She is one of the most thrilling artists on the
New York stage. Together, she and Koma are giving primitivism a good name.

the thousands of shows staged in London over the last decade, the only
memorable exhibitions of western works of art that spring to my mind are the
V&amp;A's Rococo: Art &amp; Design in Hogarth's England (1984), Paul de Lamerie at
the Goldsmiths' Hall in 1990 and the in-house celebration of George IV's
Carlton House at the Queen's Gallery three years ago. And
characteristically, it took a collaboration between the Liverpool Museums
and a commercial furniture dealer, Blairman's, to re-establish the
reputation of the extraordinary George Bullock as one of the greatest
cabinet-makers and designers that England has produced, in an exemplary show
in 1988.
By refreshing contrast, a number of promising shows of objects and applied
arts are scheduled for London in the New Year. The first, at the Royal
Academy from January 20, presents highlights from the choice, idiosyncratic
and wide-ranging collection of antiquities amassed by George Ortiz. In an
age in which any rich-ish professional calls himself a collector, it is
heartening to discover that the rare breed of connoisseur is not quite
extinct.
A quite different taste is exhibited at the V&amp;A when over 350 pieces
produced by the House of Faberge, Imperial Jewellers, go on show, courtesy
of the Hermitage and the Faberge Arts Foundation of Washington DC (January
26-April 10). From February 16, the museum is also host to The Golden Age
1730-1760: Brass Inlaid furniture by John Channon and his Contemporaries, a
show which originated from that powerhouse of furniture history, Temple
Newsam House in Leeds.
What should be the exhibition to go and see in 1994 is the V&amp;A's monographic
study of one of the most profoundly influential figures of the 19th century,
AWN Pugin, the father of the Gothic Revival. Pugin: A Gothic Passion (June
15-September 11) takes up the perhaps unenviable challenge of presenting the
great Goth as architect and designer of everything from furniture and
metalwork to silver, ceramics, jewellery, textiles, wallpaper and stage
sets.

VIVE MOI] AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY by Sean O'Faolain Sinclair-Stevenson Pounds 20,
377 pages
When the late Sean O'Faolain was in his eighties, his daughter Julia
encouraged him to write a supplement to his 1964 autobiography. In deference
to his wife, Eileen, the earlier volume had not mentioned three important
affairs of his middle age - with Elizabeth Bowen, Honor Tracy and an
American socialite, Kick Erlanger. By then he was finding writing
increasingly difficult, and this was the only subject that appealed to him,
as Julia O'Faolain explains in her introductory 'Afterword' (sic).
The original Vive Moi] contained an interesting and selective record of a
writer's development. He was born in Cork in 1900, the son of a policeman
and a woman who took in theatrical lodgers, grew up during the Gaelic
Revival, the Easter Rising and the Civil War and then won a scholarship to
Harvard. By the time his first collection of stories was published in 1932
the best of the autobiography is over. When not discussing writing,
O'Faolain falls into a flat anecdotal tone. He is good at specific
descriptions but cannot handle abstract ideas.
O'Faolain first met Elizabeth Bowen some time before the 1939 war (the date
is not clear). He read The Last September on his way to London and arrived
in a state of great excitement about this 'Irish Turgenev'. An acquaintance
organised a lunch to introduce the stately Anglo-Irish woman to the
disillusioned patriot who had fought for the new Republic only to have it
ban his books as obscene. She was only a year older than he, but they were
worlds apart. The trouble with O'Faolain's account of this unlikely alliance
is that we learn very little about Elizabeth Bowen as a person, although he
does eventually insinuate that Elizabeth the writer was not quite Irish
enough for his tastes.
More revealing is Julia's memory of 'La Bowen' as a source of contention
between Sean and Eileen because she invited Sean but not Eileen to house
parties. Julia also points out that O'Faolain's supposedly candid memoir
does not mention Eileen's 'stress-maladies . . . brought on by your
philandering with Honor Tracy'.
Much is made by the ungallant O'Faolain of Honor Tracy's plainness: a buxom
red-head with no ankles who, nevertheless, was known to the pub-gossips
within months of arriving in Dublin after the war as 'Hot Pants Tracy'. When
eventually she seduces O'Faolain he is overwhelmed by her sexual expertise
and he seems to have remained in her thrall for several years. We learn from
the Afterword that when the affair was over she rented a small tower in the
same village as O'Faolain and his family, and lived there defiantly for
years, which says more about her spirit and her sense of humour than
O'Faolain does.
Julia O'Faolain's affection for her father and her understanding of him are
evident in her Afterword which is drafted (rather archly) as an intimate
letter to 'dear Sean'. But her judgment in publishing the often portentous
ramblings of his old age be questioned. She has apparently edited his
'candid supplement', but not with any great care. To misquote Yeats once is
bad enough, but to misquote him twice and follow that with a misquotation
from one of Shakespeare's best known sonnets is inexcusable. Neither is any
effort made to tidy up the chronology. Worst of all, we do not really learn
anything of interest about two of the more important friendships in his life
 -with Elizabeth Bowen and Honor Tracy - except for the fact that these
friendships also had a sexual side.

THE STAG AT BAY: THE SCOTTISH RED DEER CRISIS by Michael Wigan Swan Hill
Press Pounds 12.95 150 pages
That wildlife's best friends are hunters is the politically-awkward paradox
that forms the basis of Michael Wigan's study of red deer and green
politics.
There are some 300,000 red deer in Scotland, most of them living on some 200
deer forests - large tracts of hill inhabited mainly by deer and sheep,
stalkers and shepherds. To be viable in different stalking conditions,
including an unscheduled visit by hill-walkers, these deer forests tend to
be big: the author's own, Borrobol, covers some 23,000 acres.
Elsewhere such estates would be exceptional but Scottish hill ground is
unproductive and has always been tied up in great holdings. Before the
private lairds there were the clan chiefs. Now there are new landowners,
such as the RSPB and Scottish Natural Heritage, with new ideas. The heather
hills, once the sportsman's lonely preserve, are now cherished as part of
Europe's last wilderness. Conservationists, ramblers and mountaineers all
want their share of these private estates devoted to deer. The red stag,
long a heraldic symbol of power, has become the unwitting icon of a
conservation and social clash.
The new conservationists stress that the glens once supported far higher
human populations, who were removed in the Clearances between 1780-1830 and
replaced by sheep; the Victorians then discovered deer-stalking and some
3.6m acres were given over to this. The owners were abetted by the sheep and
deer in this transformation, whose busy molars ensured that all trees were
shorn to destruction and that a deer forest remained anything but wooded.
This is no longer acceptable in conservationist circles, where bio-diversity
is all. The aim now is to reproduce the ancient Caledonian forest, to
restore the land to its prehistoric state. Wigan describes how the
Cairngorms Working Party Report outlined a strategy for the creation of two
vast new forests at Strathspey and Mar. All foreign trees, such as larch,
lodgepole and spruce, would be removed and replaced with home species.
The plan could not possibly work, however, without the wholesale shooting of
the red deer, which would otherwise destroy the new saplings. The exact
number needed to be culled is not given, but Wigan cites the figures of the
East Grampian Deer Management Group, which estimates that deer over 500,000
hectares would have to be reduced to a token population if a deer-free area
of 50,000 hectares were to be created.
A similar operation to restore tree growth was undertaken on the
4,000-hectare Creag Meagaidh estate, owned by Scottish Natural Heritage. In
17 years the deer population was reduced from 1,200 to 56. Over 500,000
hectares the cull would involve killing on a massive scale.
The deer-forest owners are anxious that this should not happen. Venison
brings in Pounds 3.5m annually, according to Wigan, with a further Pounds
3.7m in stalking fees. Such sums are vital in an impoverished area.
Sadly, the locals, both human and cervine, appear to have a minor role in
the new thinking on ancient forest. It is not only the stag at bay in
Wigan's account, but also much of rural Highland society.

Keillor allowing his irreverent imagination to take flight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE BOOK OF GUYS by Garrison Keillor Faber Pounds 14.99, 340 pages
Garrison Keillor is always being described as the funniest writer in America
today, but be warned, he is not everyone's cup of tea. His new collection of
a score of stories and scripts, The Book of Guys, exposes his weaknesses as
well as his strengths, and confirms that he takes a big risk when he turns
his back on his home base, the wonderfully named Lake Wobegon.
Keillor was - is - a radio broadcaster of genius who over eight years has
published half-a-dozen collections in which the anecdotes are often framed
in a first-person reminiscence of small-town life in Minnesota. They are all
available in Faber paperback and newcomers might as well start with the
first, Lake Wobegon Days, in which the gazetteer footnote on page 1 records
that 'bleakly typical of the prairie, Lake Wobegon has its origins in the
utopian vision of 19th-century New England Transcendalists but now is
populated mainly by Norwegians and Germans'. Keillor then adds, in his lean,
pleasing style, that 'a breeze off the Lake brings a sweet air of mud and
rotting wood, a slight fishy smell, and picks up the sweetness of old
grease, a sharp whiff of gasoline, fresh tires, spring dust, and, from
across the street, the faint essence of tuna hotdish at the Chatterbox Cafe
. . .'
From the beginning, Keillor has been playing with nostalgia, and therefore
with sentiment; harking back constantly to the intensity and the
embarrassments of adolescence ('He had never liked beer. Beer parties were
big deals at school: twenty carloads of students out at an abandoned granite
quarry, a beer keg in every trunk, radios blasting, and beautiful women
careening into the bushes to throw up'); risking the corny, straw-chewing,
folksy wisdom ('Luck lies in not getting what you thought you wanted but
getting what you have, which once you have it you may be smart enough to see
is what you would have wanted had you known'). All these dangerous
inclinations have been redeemed by wit ('He made a list of experiences he
thought he should have in order to become a writer. He left No. 1 blank for
fear his mother might see it. No. 2 was Europe; No. 3 was despair . . .').
(I apologise for all these parentheses but it is difficult to convey the
flavour of Keillor without resorting to excessive quotation.)
The Book of Guys is not set in Lake Wobegon, but Minnesota still features
prominently, with diversions to South Dakota, Maine, a venomously described
Vermont, President Bush's DC, and Heaven, from which the cowboy Lonesome
Shorty sends his sad story. The linking theme is that 'guys are in trouble.
Guys are gloomy . . .' The fault lies in monogamy, and in particular in the
nature of women in this feminist age ('A monogamous man is like a bear
riding a bicycle: he can be trained to do it but he would rather be in the
woods, doing what bears do.')
So it is no surprise that 'Guy Pride' is sweeping the US - and here Keillor
has great fun with the 'Wild Man' antics of (real-life) poet Robert Bly and
his imitators, not least in a monologue by Al Denny, the absent-minded,
best-selling New Age author of Being The Person You Are and Re-birthing The
Me You Used To Be.
Truth to tell, this is a curate's egg of a collection, by which I mean that
some of the episodes should never have seen the light of day, particularly a
cute anecdote about two mice and a dubious tale of a missionary's son who
catches leprosy from an African toilet seat. Some are Over The Top (eg
'Christmas In Vermont'); some are too tricky for Keillor to pull off (Zeus
as a Lutheran pastor). Others are more successful: Dionysus at 50
discovering that he has run out of immortality; the injured football hero
who runs happily to fat; Earl Grey, 'the only living American to have a
popular beverage named after him, Dr David Pepper having passed away a few
years before').
Which reminds us that Keillor stands or falls as a humorous writer and
deserves to be rated in a distinguished tradition that includes Thurber: it
is no coincidence that he appears in the New Yorker. The wisecrack is part
of the tradition - as in 'Seduction is a mutual endeavour in which I
conspire with a woman to give her an opening to do what she wants to do
without reminding her that this goes against her principles'. Or the deadly
parody - for instance, President Bush reacting to the invasion of Chicago by
the barbarian Huns: 'The President is in charge, Bob. That's part of the
job. I think that people who think the President is not in charge are going
to have a very big surprise coming. I don't want to say what it is.'
Thirdly, there is an American delight in exaggeration taken in a logical
progression to absurdity - Catch 22 is a sustained example - and Keillor has
this gift of allowing an irreverent imagination to take flight. Thus, of
travelling First Class: 'The flight attendants wore gold-paisley sarongs
slit up the side and pink-passion lipstick, they were Barnard graduates (cum
laude) in humanities, and they set a vase of fresh roses on my table, along
with the seviche and salmon loaf and crab puffs with Mornay sauce, and they
leaned over me, their perfect college-educated breasts hanging prettily in
place, and they whispered, 'You've got a nice butt. You ever read Kant?''
Is that funny? Isn't it? Up to a point, Lord Copper.

THE INNER GAME by Dominic Lawson Macmillan Pounds 14.99, 249 pages
I must declare an interest. I have played two chess-games against the
subject of this book, Nigel Short, and one against the author, Dominic
Lawson. I lost all three. Those with Short were part of a 'Simul'. This is
when a grandmaster takes on 20 or more players simultaneously. One was for a
charity dedicated to victims of torture (an appropriate cause I felt as
Short tied me up in knots). Dominic Lawson also participated on that
occasion and held Short to a draw.
The other was to celebrate publication of The Oxford Companion to Chess  -
one of the players, Adam Hart-Davis, actually beat Short. My Lawson
encounter was a more even contest. At the end my opponent said graciously:
'You ought to play with Freddie. You'd give each other a good game.' He
meant AJ Ayer, his philosopher step-father, whom I did play subsequently,
and the result was a draw. Afterwards Freddie said: 'I think if we'd gone on
I might have beaten you . . .' - a good example of language, truth and
logic.
I mention this because it reinforces something that emerges from The Inner
Game, Lawson's fascinating behind-the-scenes account of the recent World
Chess Championship at the Savoy Theatre. Chess ability does not appear to be
correlated with any other kind of ability. You can be a great philosopher
and at the same time an eager duffer at chess. Alternatively you can be a
great chess-player and a very unsatisfactory human being.
What, then, are Garri Kasparov and Nigel Short really like as people? All
that counted in the end was the moves they made in their 20 games. They are
given in full at the end of this book. Still, after the immense media
coverage the event attracted, one remains curious to know more about them
away from the board and Lawson, from his privileged standpoint as Short's
confidant and support throughout the match, is the man to tell us - though,
be warned, in Lawson's eyes Short can do no wrong even when he loses.
The Challenger emerges as a saintly Brit determined that one day his own
name, and by implication his country's, shall be inscribed on chess's
supreme roll of honour. By contrast the reigning World Champion Kasparov -
'Gazza', Short calls him - emerges as an arrogant self-seeking bullying
two-timing thug. Whether or not this is a gross distortion, one thing is
clear: the two contenders absolutely loathed each other. Nothing was ever
more formal, less real, than their initial handshakes.
Yet before the match began they came together to form an unholy alliance. It
was like Churchill becoming pals with Stalin to defeat an even greater
object of hatred. In this instance it was one Florencio Campomanes,
president of FIDE, the governing body of world chess. Kasparov had never
forgiven Campo from stopping an earlier world championship match with Karpov
just when he (Garri) seemed to be moving in for the kill.
And Short was piqued by Campo's plan to stage this championship match in
Manchester - a deal made after much tortuous negotiation and concluded
without consultation with Short who at the time was incommunicado on his way
to Athens.
Both players were incensed by the 25 per cent slice of their prize-money
FIDE proposed to take for itself. Thereafter a schism in international chess
opened with a newly formed PCA (Professional Chess Association), the
brainchild of Short and Kasparov, setting itself up as a rival ruling body.
This fracture is still unhealed.
Lawson was privy to all the intricate wheeling and dealing. He had at an
earlier stage in Short's career been instrumental in getting him financial
backing to develop his chess from Sir Patrick Sheehy's Eagle Star insurance
group. Now he was in the middle of a hurly-burly involving a consortium
consisting of Rupert Murdoch's News International advised by Raymond Keene
that eventually prevailed as the angel of the breakaway World Chess
Championship. According to Lawson, Kasparov was keeping open the Fide option
right to the end. It was a situation far more complicated than anything that
happened later on the chessboard and Lawson keeps an admirably clear head
describing it all.
The result was two matches for the same title: a Fide-run championship
between Timman and Karpov (the runners-up of the world match) in Rotterdam;
and the self-styled World Chess Championship at the Savoy between Kasparov
and Short, which eclipsed the other almost totally.
Lawson takes us interestingly through Short's entire process of preparation
for the great event. We observe him co-opting a team of fellow grandmasters
like, the emigre Czech Lubosh Kavalek in the US and Jon Speelman in the UK,
his long hours of work with them on his potential opening strategy. Chess at
this level is played by committee with a chairman who has the power to
override everything the committee proposes.
Then there is Lawson's exciting blow-by blow accounts of the games
themselves which, without going his into a lot of boring technicalities, are
pithily recreated along with all the post-mortem sessions. Even though we
know the outcome, these games retain all the tension that came across at the
time. Game 16, the solitary game that a grey, drained, haggard Short won,
renewing our faith in him, loses nothing of its triumph in Lawson's verbal
action replay.
Short's dignity in defeat was exemplary. Indeed his decorously correct
behaviour in public throughout the match seems strangely at variance with
his bouts of verbal abuse, especially of his opponent, recorded here.
Short's wife Rea and small daughter were nearby for most of the contest
whereas Kasparov's wife remained at home leaving his mum to act as his
comforter - not a role much in demand.
Kasparov's Jewish father died when he was a child. Short's parents' marriage
broke up; his father left their Lancashire home when Nigel was a child
chess-prodigy. For this Championship Short found a father substitute in
Kavalek, a man turned 50, whom he then sacked half way through the match. It
was Freud who said that chess was a symbolic re-enactment of the Oedipus
conflict. Possibly he was right.

WITNESS AGAINST THE BEST by EP Thompson Cambridge University Press Pounds
17.95, 234 pages
Everything characteristic of the late EP Thomson - his clarity, humanity,
and breadth of learning - is present in this book, the last he wrote. It is
an absorbing historical detective story revealing aspects of English history
usually neglected in the textbooks. With his customary skill Thompson brings
vividly into view the turbulence of social and religious life in the 17th
and 18th centuries, his aim being to contribute to a great scholarly debate
 -the mystery of where the poet William Blake got his extraordinary
religious and poetic imagery.
There is an entire academic industry devoted to Blake, and Thompson ventures
into it with disarming robustness. There are almost as many views as there
are scholars on the question of what influences shaped Blake's imagination,
an imagination which seems in equal parts surreal and bizarre until one
glimpses the rich veins of dissenting religion which fed it.
Thompson's intimate sympathy for the life of England below the grand social
level where constitutional history is made - the level of bishops, dukes and
princes - gives him a sharp sense of the tumultuous life of popular
religious thought. Ranters and Quakers, Muggletonians, Diggers and
Behmenists, strove with one another, the established order, and even
themselves, in a surging flux of thought in the 17th century. Thompson's
concern is to discover in this rich tradition the basis of Blake's ideas,
expressed in the vivid symbolism of great poems like 'Jerusalem' and 'The
Marriage of Heaven and Hell', and in the extraordinary illustrations which
accompany them.
Blake could not, Thompson argues, have simply made up ab novo the resonant
vocabulary of symbolism which distinguishes his work. Its character and
consistency suggest not miscellaneous reading fuelling the free play of
imagination, but a rich tradition upon which he could draw. What was it?
Some say that Blake's source is the Bible as interpreted by Milton and
radical Dissent. Others say it is the doctrines of such movements as the
Moravians, Rosicrucians or Swedenborgians. Yet others hold that Blake was as
an omnivorous and eclectic reader who helped himself to an assortment of
notions from as far afield as Neoplatonism and the Kabbala, mixing them into
his own poetic vision.
Into this whirl of opinions Thompson brings his forensic skills to suggest
an answer. It goes as follows.
In the 17th century many dissenting groups saw the God of established
religion as a 'God-devil', presiding over a Babylon of bishops and parsons
who aided the state in oppressing ordinary people. Dissenting religion and
political revolution were closely allied in the Leveller and Ranter
movements of the time. Doctrinally these ideas expressed themselves as a
rejection of the outward forms of established religion - including, for
example, marriage - in favour of inspiration and prophecy.
These revolutionary movements were suppressed, but one strand of them
survived and, a century and a half later, was still an influence as Blake
was writing his great poems. This was the Muggletonian movement, named after
Ludowik Muggleton who with his cousin John Reeve preached a striking gospel.
The serpent, they said, had literally entered Eve's womb in Eden, and
dissolved there into seed, so that some of her progeny - Cain and his
succession-were offspring of Satan. Thus mankind is a mixture of sons of
Adam and the devil. Later God literally dissolved himself in Mary's womb
likewise, and was made man; so that while Jesus walked the earth there was
no God in Heaven. One Muggletonian creed ran, 'I believe in God the Man
Christ Jesus, who was a Spiritual Body from all Eternity Who by Virtue of
his Godhead Power Entered into the narrow passage of the Blessed Virgin
Mary's Womb And so Dissolved Himself into Seed and nature and Clothed
Himself with Flesh Blood and Bone as with a Garment; thereby made Capable to
Suffer Death.' Not unsurprisingly the Muggletonians were accused of
blasphemous obscenity, and remained an underground organisation.
Muggletonian notions, Thompson argues, echo strongly in Blake's writings.
Reason is regarded as the work of the devil; the theme of the serpent
copulating with Eve appears constantly; and so does the idea that the evil
in man results from that copulation. Thompson demonstrates that these themes
pervade Blake's poems and paintings.
But Thompson might have made a discovery - he is judiciously cautious about
it, because the evidence is incomplete - which makes the Muggletonian
connection with Blake persuasive. It is that his mother very likely came
from a Muggletonian family. If so, a powerful conduit for these ideas
directly links the Muggletonian teachings to Blake's extraordinary poems.
Historical detective work carries its dangers; dramatic mistakes can be made
in reconstructions of the past. Thompson was always alert to the dangers. He
weds caution to brilliance, and tempers insight with fact. But in his hands
the result, as this fascinating study shows, still reads like a thriller.

<TEXT>
For two years, I have been engaged in an assault on a listed garden
monument. Such assaults provoke others to assault them, but my news for the
new year is mercifully simple. The assault is in place: immovably so, as it
has involved about 200 megaliths of York stone.
I therefore declare 1994 the Year of the Mound, having changed the face of
the biggest surviving mound in Britain which has dominated my Oxford
college's gardens for 350 years.
Mounds, or mounts, became popular as gardening emerged from the middle ages.
They were hillocks, built artificially, off which gardeners could survey
their handiwork or risk a glimpse of wild nature beyond the garden wall.
When New College in Oxford decided to build a mound, wild nature over its
city wall amounted to the deer park and woolly fellows of Magdalen College.
When complete, its mound also looked down on four famous knot gardens,
embroidered with coats of arms, a floral clock and the college's motto,
Manners Makyth Man.
Some believe the mound began in 1529 when 500 loads of rubbish were dumped
in the gardens. Certainly, it had been started by the 1590s when 'ye
gardener' was being paid a shilling for piling earth 'towards the making of
the mount'.
The piling and barrowing continued for 60 years. In 1648-49, historians
focus on the civil war, but New College had an event of its own: its mound
was complete, with steps at intervals up to its summit and a hedge round its
girth.
Since then, the knot gardens have given way to a lawn and wild nature beyond
the wall has become our barbarous building. The steps have fallen away; the
fellows' learned sundial has disappeared; trees have sprouted at random,
especially some horrible sycamores; and the view has been dominated by two
fine holm oaks, one of which dates back to the 19th century.
In 1991, the prospect changed. Kenneth Rose, a journalist and historian,
donated a sum to his old college for the mound's improvement. Everybody
agreed that the undergrowth needed to be cleared, except for the London
Evening Standard which lamented the plan, alleging that it traditionally
offered covert to the sexual affairs of undergraduates.
To widen access, I pictured a tapering staircase in stone, opening the mound
in a bold, full-frontal ascent.
But as a listed monument, a mound needs planning permission - and this has
to satisfy building regulations and protesting parties.
Many more parties are interested now than in 1648. A pressure group for
rural spaces said the idea was intrusive in a rural setting, although the
garden is in the middle of Oxford; heritage groups claimed that the weeds
and decay on the mound were part of your and my heritage; and the Garden
History Society opposed the proposal on the ground that it did not qualify
as a restoration because it was not restoring the original steps.
The city council began to waver. Could I not scale down the ambition and
build a partial staircase, only a third of the way to the top of the hill?
Refusing to climb down, we put the full-frontal to the councillors who
debated it, voted - and let it through. After a year's 'consultation', we
were free to do what we wanted.
The scheme nearly foundered on the standard advice of gardening handbooks.
In their diagrams, steps have separate risers and separate slabs as treads.
We mapped out experimental risers and dropped flat slabs on to them like
mini-bricks, but the result looked ever more awful because of the scale of
the whole.
I was saved by John Robins, who practises architecture in north London. He
saw that we should ignore the garden books and make the steps from single
blocks. In such a bold setting, blocks have the quality which conventional
treads lack.
Blocks also require muscle and the talent of stone masons. We commissioned a
local team which carted and hoisted tons of gravel and the blocks for 50
broad, tapering steps.
If I encourage you to anything similar, be sure to use a trained architect:
about Pounds 18,000 sufficed for the stone and labour of our staircase,
which now rises like the steps up a massive ancient ziggurat, beautifying a
mound which had lost its point through too many years of conservation.
The city council did make one condition. It insisted that an archaeological
survey should precede this new folly. The Oxford Archaeological Unit, under
Chris Bell
found nothing to cause further bother, apart from some mugs, clay pipes,
oyster shells and one puzzle: a quantity of small bones, remains of an
unidentified animal.
These bones have now been identified, not from carbon dating but from the
London cocktail circuit. In the early 1980s two female undergraduates kept a
lamb in college. It lived in their bathroom; they named it Ruffly. Their
cleaner fed it a toffee bar, whereupon it choked and died while its keepers
were attending a lecture.
They gave it its last rites on the college mound and buried it darkly at
dead of night, turning the sods with their mortarboards. Five days'
archaeology on the orders of the council exhumed poor Ruffly, kept in breach
of college regulations.
On a high hill (as the poet, John Donne, puts it), rugged and steep, Truth
stands. Nothing stands above our staircase except a proposal for an
inauguration on Ascension Day, on which atheists can merely see the stairs'
ascent and others can impose a Christian interpretation. To the beat of
drums, under-achieving pupils and tutors can be led up for execution by the
academic auditors, sent recently by the Department of Education to measure
our added value.
Perhaps visitors will call for a statue on our high hill. Some may think
that Ruffly deserves a memorial, patron of our academic flock. In the
deconstructed climate of today's intellectuals, I would prefer to leave a
void and signify Truth by a leap into nothingness on the top.

FT  08 JAN 94 / Sport: Heat is on for Olympics - Equestrianism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEITH WHEATLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Winter in Newmarket. A freezing wind scalps East Anglia. On the gallops,
breath from racehorses frosts and curls away. But indoors, guests are
loosening their ties and the windows are running with condensation. It is
30'C (86'F), with 80 per cent humidity. We are in the Deep South.
Costly climate control equipment is reproducing the conditions found in
mid-summer in Atlanta, where the 1996 Olympics will be held. At the equine
performance centre of the Animal Health Trust, an event horse wearing an
oxygen mask in debilitating heat is becoming acclimatised to a canter on a
massive treadmill.
Eventing is addressing the problems of running a physically demanding
Olympic event in a harsher climate than ever before. The sport knows it is
being watched closely by the animal rights movement, which opposes the very
notion of taking horses to Georgia at that time of year.
Some top riders share their doubts, including US horseman Bruce Davidson who
has been quoted as saying that no international three-day event should ever
take place there. Politically, though, eventing cannot simply duck the
Atlanta Olympics. Equestrianism is one of a handful of elite and expensive
sports that Juan Antonio Samaranch, president of the International Olympic
Committee, and other top officials would like to see eliminated from the
summer games.
'If the horse sports were dropped now, they would probably never get back
into the Olympics,' says Dr David Marlin, head of the Newmarket research
project. He hopes during 1994 to find out just what happens to the
physiology of a horse under the gruelling demands of three-day eventing.
'After the 1992 Barcelona games, it was clear that we didn't know what
happened when horses exercised under adverse conditions - indeed, even what
the phrase meant in equine terms.'
In Barcelona, one event horse did collapse from heat exhaustion, although it
was revived (and there was some evidence that its fitness training in Russia
had been inadequate). In any case, it seems likely that dressage horses
standing about in the midday sun may have suffered more than competitors
blasting around a six-mile cross-country course.
What is certain is that reporters from countries such as the Netherlands and
Germany, where eventing is a moral issue to match fox-hunting in Britain,
were out in force. Cameras were at every difficult fence, awaiting a
catastrophe.
'In Atlanta, we could have in excess of 86 degrees and 80 per cent
humidity,' says Marlin. 'At present, no one knows whether horses can cope
with that, or how long they might take to acclimatise. We need some hard
facts before the sport can say whether the location is acceptable or not.'
The study began last season with detailed monitoring programmes on horses
taking part in the Blair Castle and Burghley three-day events. Marlin's team
recorded body weight, heart rate, rectal temperature and blood chemistry at
every stage of the competitions.
The next stage has been training event horses to use the treadmill so they
can replicate in laboratory conditions the demands of a full competition.
Four event horses owned by the British army are being used initially for
this. 'In about three days you can train them to walk, trot, canter and
gallop,' says Marlin. 'They adapt much faster than humans beings tested in a
gym, in my experience.'
He understands the wariness of those who might be shocked to see a horse
wearing a face mask on a treadmill, but points out: 'Any rider will tell you
about the difficulty of making a horse do something he doesn't want to.
You're talking about 550 pounds of bone and muscle here. It's not dangerous
to the animals. We're not trying to induce heat exhaustion. If they can do
only half the test, then that is it. We can see when things are starting to
go wrong - which you can't when you're out on the cross-country course.'
The attention to detail in the laboratory is so complete that there is even
a huge fan several feet ahead of the horse's treadmill position; this
simulates the air flow over the body at different speeds. The Pounds 40,000
project has been financed by equal grants from the International Equestrian
Federation and the International League for the Protection of Horses.
The next stage will be in the spring when the horses are moved to an
air-conditioned stable block where they will live for months in the
conditions of mid-summer Atlanta. This should provide evidence of how well
acclimatisation helps competition horses - rather like athletes training at
altitude before the Mexico City games.
As a scientist, though, isn't Marlin affected by the fact that everyone
involved in the sport wants his research to show that eventing can happen at
Atlanta? After all, a 'no' vote from Newmarket could kill equestrianism as
an Olympic sport.
Marlin disagrees: 'Our only concern is the welfare of the horses. If we come
to the conclusion that three-day eventing isn't possible in Atlanta
conditions, we're going to come out and say so.
'This research has implications that stretch a long way past the 1996
Olympics. In the future, I believe we'll be offering a Bupa-style checkup
for the competition horse.'

FT  08 JAN 94 / Sport: Antarctic voyage success
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The crew of the Sir Ernest Shackleton, on a voyage to retrace the rescue
mission of the British explorer after his ship, Endurance, was crushed by
the polar pack ice (FT, December 18), landed safely on South Georgia writes
Roderic Dunnett.
Trevor Potts and three colleagues left Elephant Island in Antarctica on
December 24. The 23ft boat was becalmed at first but made several days' good
sailing, helped by currents, before hitting 36 hours of gales.
By noon on January 3, the party was 100 miles east of South Georgia. Having
made landfall, they ran into force 8 gales - recalling the harsh lee shore
conditions encountered by Shackleton in 1916 - but found shelter in Elsehul,
a rocky harbour at the north west tip of South Georgia and landed on January
5.
The crew plans to cross the neck of land known as the Shackleton Gap on
foot, tracing, in reverse, part of the route the explorer took on his
mountain trek to Stromness, the Norwegian whaling station, where he found
help for his marooned companions.
Potts' arrival coincided with the start of the International Boat Show, at
Earls Court, where Shackleton's boat, the James Caird, is displayed.

FT  08 JAN 94 / Sport: What the professionals do in winter - Golf
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEREK LAWRENSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fifteen years ago Ian Woosnam used to wonder how he would make ends meet
during the winter.
His seasonal earnings exhausted, Woosnam would ring around his friends in
his native Oswestry to see if there was any part-time work available as a
barman, a waiter, a greenkeeper or a milkman.
This was the lot of a tournament professional who had finished outside the
top 20 in the money list. The year was clearly defined and there were long
months to try and fill with something other than the only life they cared
about.
Times have changed, at least for the male touring professionals: the women
still have to do bar work or help out in their local friendly professional's
shop.
Woosnam, now a tax exile and a millionaire many times over, spends November
and December in the southern hemisphere before returning to his new home on
Jersey for Christmas.
There is hardly any reason for professionals to take a break at all. Just 23
days have elapsed since the Johnny Walker World Championship in Jamaica, but
already the restless have clubs in their hands and tickets in their pockets.
The European tour season begins again on Thursday in Madeira. In the US, the
winter break was even shorter. Their tour is already under way in
California.
Sometimes it is difficult for the fan to sustain interest in golf in
mid-winter. Did we really want to read about an another already-rich golfer
earning another Pounds 1m in Sun City? Did we feel sympathy for Sam Torrance
when he complained, about the heat in Jamaica, while at golf clubs all over
Britain the 'course closed' signs went up because of the incessant rain.
Even though they can play through the winter, many professionals take a
break.
Severiano Ballesteros has not been seen since October but he has not been
pulling pints or delivering milk. Usually, no-one works harder out of season
on his golf than Ballesteros. This year he has changed his plans because of
his chronic lower back condition. Ballesteros has spent an hour each morning
doing calisthenics and working out on special machines. With two young
children to occupy his time, he has had plenty to think about other than his
golf. Given his poor form and lack of desire last year, this may be no bad
thing. He will not play in public until February.
Ballesteros has been outspoken about the demands upon the top players by the
year-round golfing calendar. His answer is to stay at home. Nick Faldo's
solution is to spread his 26-tournament workload throughout the year. He is
just as likely to have three weeks off in July or August, as he did in 1993,
as in December or January.
For most players, there remains a period, sometimes quite short, when their
winter thoughts tend to other things, other sports. Many, like Peter Baker
(Wolverhampton Wanderers) and Trish Johnson (Arsenal), finally get to use
their football season tickets. Paul Broadhurst follows Atherston FC of the
Beazer Homes League around the country with his friends. Jamie Spence and
Roger Chapman can be spotted around the paddock at Kempton race track.
Two Swedes, Joakim Haeggman and Robert Karlsson, go skiing, another, Anders
Forsbrands, plays ice hockey.
Patrick Hall contemplates life and the universe with his exotic fish. Mark
James watches Star Trek videos.
The point of all this is to give the mind a break from golf. Baker's play in
the World Championship, when he finished 31 strokes behind the winner, Larry
Mize, indicates what happens when you do not.
Nick Price, does not let anything come between him and his native Harare in
December. He says: 'I regard that as my golden time of the year. It's the
time that I've worked really hard all year to enjoy.'
The promising young professional, Jim Payne, agrees: 'The season is so long
that if you don't find other things to do in the winter you find you're
mentally exhausted come the big events in September. You have to pace
yourself. Obviously there are some players who like to play more golf than
others but they'd be carting you off to the nuthouse if you didn't stop
thinking about golf at some point.'
Payne, likes to go and watch Grimsby play football. Such is his talent, and
therefore earnings potential, that he should have enough to buy them in a
couple of years. That would certainly give him something else to think
about.

FT  08 JAN 94 / Property: VAT may fuel a move to greener homes - How to
improve the energy-efficiency of your house - and save money on heating
bills
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Vatman cometh in April to claw 8 per cent on domestic energy bills from
every house and flat in the country. A year later he will take 17.5 per
cent. They are painful charges. But despair not. You can ease their impact.
In the short-term, fill the oil tank (if that is the fuel you use) in March
and pre-pay as much as you can afford for gas, oil and electricity.
Over the long term be prepared to be strict. Sit down and work out your
annual costs. Then think hard how to make a more energy-efficient home. How
can it create less carbon dioxide, the chief agent of the greenhouse effect,
and save you pounds? All three fuels affect the environment. If you think
electricity must be cleaner, remember that it starts at the power stations.
Pre-payment gives temporary relief to the household purse, but does nothing
for the environment. As cash flow, it will delight suppliers but not Kenneth
Clarke, the chancellor, since it cuts the tax take.
Pay before VAT on fuel comes into force and you will not be liable for the
tax until your credit with your supplier runs out. You forfeit use of the
money but, with interest rates on cash well below 8 per cent it has to be a
bargain. And you have the comfort of knowing the bills are paid.
How much can you manage? A year's worth, or two or three? If you pay a
monthly average through the year, it may be more complicated. But it should
still be possible to pre-pay between now and March.
Then check on how to cut your heating bills permanently. The first steps are
easy. Wear more clothes, lower the thermostat, draw the curtains earlier and
turn off unnecessary lights. Long-life, low-wattage bulbs are expensive but
better value in the long run. If your home is stuffed with electrical
gadgets, from coffee-makers to video recorders, need they be on all the
time?
Payback is the vital concept for the next stage for improving insulation and
heating water in the most efficient way possible. Heating costs account for
more than half the typical fuel bill. Woolwich Building society has
estimated that, if the thermal jacket around the hot water tank is less than
three inches thick, a new, denser, foam-insulated jacket will pay for itself
in a year (payback: one to two years).
What you may need most is a new efficient gas or oil boiler. Gas and
oil-fired condensing boilers are far more efficient than older types
(payback: three to six years) If you replace your boiler with a gas
condensing model, you may qualify for a Pounds 200 grant from the Energy
Saving Trust (details from the Heating and Ventilating Contractors
Association). For best use, have individual thermostatic controls fitted to
radiators, or room thermostats (but not the two together), and a thermostat
for the hot water cylinder.
A shelf over a radiator under a window forces hot air back into the room,
and aluminium foil fitted behind a radiator, especially on an outside wall,
reflects the heat inwards and stops it escaping into the wall.
A cheap way of starting a home insulation programme is to put draught
excluder strips on doors and windows. Going further and insulating the loft
and the spaces below the floors and in the wall cavity (if possible) are
more expensive and have a payback of several years.
If you are thinking of putting in double glazing or adding external cladding
to the building, and you live in a listed building or conservation area,
consult the planning authority first.
If you are uncertain about what to do, call in an independent assessor under
the National Home Energy Rating (NHER) scheme which measures home's energy
efficiency on a scale of 0 (very poorly insulated) to 10.
Your home will be rated and you will be advised what to do and what it
costs. The national average rating is about four but new homes built to
current regulations score about seven. Authorities in Milton Keynes, the
London overspill town which is full of new houses, have adopted a minimum
rating of 7.5. The National Energy Foundation that runs the NHER scheme is
based here.
When buying a new home, ask for its NHER score as new properties should have
energy efficiency built-in.
The Woolwich, comparing two end-of-terrace three-bedroom houses, estimates
an annual fuel bill of Pounds 1,205 for the typical Edwardian house (rated
2.7 and emitting 14.6 tonnes of carbon dioxide) while for the brand new
house of similar size, with cavity wall and 6in loft insulation, it would be
Pounds 560, with 6.2 tonnes of CO2 and rated 7.5 NHER. The saving is Pounds
645. The Woolwich has also estimated how insulation can cut annual heating
costs (see chart).
In new homes such as those at the Wimpey development at West Moor,
Newcastle-upon-Tyne, (prices from Pounds 99,950) the NHER score is around 9.
Admiral Homes, building in the south-east England (in the Pounds 155,000 to
Pounds 170,000 range) has a similar average, with some homes reaching a 10
rating.
Top-rated homes are usually found to be two-bedroom houses in the middle of
a terrace, and buyers most concerned with energy efficiency tend to be those
making their second or third purchase: first-time buyers seem less worried
about running costs.
In the Building Research Establishment's Environmental Assessment Method
(the Breeam scheme) which examines the total environmental impact of new
homes and not just the heating and insulation, Admiral believes it is the
only developer to have gained a rating of 'excellent'. The demands are
stringent. As far as possible, the new home must be on a site of low
ecological value (such as an old building site) and use recycled materials.
It avoids CFC and HCFC gases that deplete the ozone layer and the timber in
the property has been pre-treated with wood preservative (rather than
treated on site).
Admiral's houses have smoke alarms and secure cupboards for storing
hazardous substances. There are four bins for different types of household
waste and a rainwater butt. Lavatories have a maximum flushing capacity of 6
litres: a good lavatory can work well with 3.5 litres of water.
In the long term this is how most houses will be: cheaper to run and far
more frugal with the earth's resources and will maintain their resale value.
Even solar heating may help. But solar energy can never be as successful in
Britain as it is in Cyprus, for example, where you can be sure of a bath
hotter than any you have had from conventional heating in Britain,
especially if you clean the solar panels regularly.
Lastly, plant trees, if you have a garden. Year after year they soak up CO2.
In the meantime, if VAT on domestic fuel concentrates the mind on energy
saving, it may have a beneficial side-effect.

FT  08 JAN 94 / Restaurants: There is such a thin as a free lunch - How to
obtain 25 per cent off a meal out and win a free dinner
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More than 2,500 restaurants in the UK and the US are taking part in the 1994
Financial Times restaurant promotion. FT readers will be entitled to a 25
per cent saving on food and drinks consumed at lunch and dinner for six
months. All who take part between January 24 and February 11 will be entered
in a draw for 1,000 free lunches (or dinners) for two offered to launch the
scheme.
This follows last January's successful two-week restaurant promotion, Lunch
for a Fiver, which offered fun and unbeatable value in the UK.
This year we offer a deal on an international scale that will last longer.
The key to the Financial Times 1994 restaurant offer is the Financial
Times/Transmedia restaurant charge card. You can apply for it, free of
charge, by writing to the address on the application form at the bottom of
this page. After that, all you require is a valid Access, Visa or Delta
charge card and a first class stamp.
Once you have sent this information off you will receive a live
FT/Transmedia restaurant charge card which you can use in any restaurant
that accepts the Transmedia card as you would any other credit card. You
will also receive the Transmedia directory of 2,400 US restaurants which
accept the card plus a listing of the British restaurants. As the number of
British restaurants which accepts this card is growing quickly we will be
providing updates of the participating restaurants on the food and drink
page of the Weekend FT.
What are the benefits for the FT reader?
The most obvious is the 25 per cent saving on food and beverages (excluding
service and vat) to which the card entitles you. This saving applies to all
the restaurants taking part whenever they are open for business.
But there is more. The attraction of this particular offer is the scope and
number of the participating restaurants. If you live in London you may well
be able to use it daily - for business entertaining or meals with friends or
family. If you live outside London, and there is currently no Transmedia
restaurant nearby, you can still apply for the card and use it when
travelling.
This also applies to FT readers living outside Britain. You can apply for an
FT/Transmedia card and use it when business or pleasure brings you to
London, Edinburgh, Bath or Bristol. Or to the US when a business or holiday
trip takes you to New York, Washington, Chicago, San Francisco or Los
Angeles. Transmedia is also planning to open a Paris office later this year.
How does it work?
For readers of most newspapers such an extraordinary offer would need no
further explanation but FT readers will doubtless be curious about its
mechanics.
Transmedia advances unsecured cash to a restaurant which it then markets to
Transmedia cardmembers. The advance is repaid on a 2 for 1 basis via the
food and beverage credits which Transmedia card members consume at these
restaurants. To encourage its members to use these restaurants more
frequently Transmedia passes on a 25 per cent saving on food and beverage
back to the card member via his or her Access, Visa or Delta card.
Since it was established in 1984 Transmedia estimates that it has advanced
more than Dollars 130m to the American restaurant industry and, during the
same period, made total savings of around Dollars 28m for its card members.
What makes Transmedia attractive to so many restaurateurs is that it has
found a niche in the market, filled it and then adapted itself to keep its
restaurants busy.
A restaurateur can put the unsecured cash to whatever use he or she chooses.
Banks have never understood the restaurant industry, sometimes with good
reason, but often because restaurateurs offer little in the way of security.
A lease is normally a restaurant's main asset and, frequently, the terms of
a lease can preclude a change of use if the restaurant fails.
None of the restaurants which join Transmedia are working with such large
margins that they can afford to reduce their prices for ever. But each has a
different commercial need and can see a positive use for an interest-free
advance: to repay a bank overdraft or directors' loans or to redecorate or
re-equip and improve service. The managing director of one highly popular
wine bar has joined because, after 14 years of packed houses, she feels the
building needs a bit of a facelift and Transmedia can provide the necessary
capital.
Transmedia takes the risk of advancing cash to the restaurant industry and
minimises this risk by marketing and promoting the restaurants. During the
late 1980s many US restaurants joined Transmedia as the recession affected
demand and high interest rates made bank borrowing to finance promotion or
publicity unthinkable. But, as the US economy improves, there has been no
slacking in the call for Transmedia's services.
The reason for this is something that is now being learnt and applied by
British restaurateurs. The high prices of the 1980s have disappeared and we
are all demanding value for money whether it is business or social
entertaining.
This means lower prices. To compensate for this, and rising overheads,
restaurants are opening longer and later. The most costly item today is not
an extra waitress but an empty table.
One restaurateur, who plans to open a large brasserie later this year in
London's West End, estimates that to break even his turnover will have to be
at least Pounds 2.5m - and that is before the builders have left the site.
A number of restaurateurs have successfully been able to keep their
restaurants busy enough to make them profitable and Ed Guinan, Transmedia's
European chairman, is aware that Transmedia may not be for every
restaurateur.
But for those keen to increase volume and turnover - and the British
restaurateurs who have already joined Transmedia will soon have the benefit

FT  08 JAN 94 / Travel: Out-of-season Nice, a smart place to be - Nicholas
Woodsworth strolls in the footsteps of the 19th century English aristocrats
who made the French Riviera fashionable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS WOODSWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Friday: I have just read the day's European weather forecast. Paris lies
under thick fog. There are gales off the Irish coast, snow in Hamburg and
arctic fronts over Moscow. Although occasional brighter spells are hinted
at, it is raining in London.
Can I be on the same continent? I am in Nice, where it is balmier than a
July day in Blackpool and the sun is blazing in a deep blue sky. If
well-heeled women are wearing furs, it is because this is the only season
they can justify showing them off. Down by the water on the palm-tree-lined
Promenade des Anglais, people more sensibly dressed are strolling in short
sleeves.
The English aristocrats who made Nice famous as a winter resort last century
had the right idea. In this season the Riviera is a world away from the rest
of drab, rain-sodden Europe. Summer on the Cote d'Azur I find too crowded to
be tolerable, but for an out-of-season break without stress or crowds, Nice
is just the ticket.
Not that from time to time Nice is not chilly or overcast. In the 19th
century extraordinary measures were taken to maintain the city's reputation
as a winter watering-hole. On occasions it snowed. Night crews were
dispatched to the promenade. Tree boughs were shaken, shrubbery dusted off,
and the evidence dumped into the sea. When visitors rose to take their
morning constitutional, not a snowflake was to be seen.
But such weather on this coast is rare, as the courtyard garden of the Hotel
La Perouse proves. The yellow lemons that hang below my balcony are genuine,
and smell heavenly. Up the hillside, on which the hotel sits, there are pink
and purple cyclamen, cactus plants covered in small white blooms, bay
laurels, thyme and rosemary in flower.
From my balcony there are glorious views in two directions - in one, the
warm ochre walls and red roofs of the old part of the city, in the other the
sunny blue Mediterranean disappearing southwards over the horizon.
There is a bright, light-filled pointillist painting by Henri Matisse,
called Luxe, Calme et Volupte, of three bathers in isolated and happy repose
by the sea. It is a title that always makes me think of winter-time Nice.
Saturday: It is the wonderfully clear and translucent Mediterranean light
that makes this city work. It is the light that brought Matisse, Dufy,
Signac, Renoir and a score of other post-impressionist artists to paint
here. It is the light that, in touching even the most banal objects, gives
them a lustre and life of their own.
How do I know? As pleasurable as they are, I do not need the works of the
post-impressionists to tell me. I have been studying eggplants and tomatoes
at the old Nice market. Weekends on the Cours Salaya in the centre of old
Nice are as rich and sensual in colour and texture as any tableau. The
buildings on either side of the broad pedestrian Cours are ornate and
Italianate in style, built last century when Nice was not French but a
possession of the House of Savoy.
Their facades range in tone from creamy yellow to sun-faded ochre and sienna
to deep magenta. The louvred shutters on their windows - protection against
fierce summers - are always a pleasant contrast: greeny-grey, olive, faded
blue or turquoise. When, in summer or winter, the sunlight hits these
buildings, they glow.
The produce on sale under the cotton awnings on the Cours is more colourful
still. The eggplants are a deeper purple, the tomatoes redder, the green
peppers greener than they are elsewhere. I love the contrast of the Nice
market. In front of the highly dignified and decorated Prefecture building
there are squawking geese and clucking hens for sale, heaps of potatoes and
strings of garlic.
Another contrast: one woman standing by a pile of broccoli drips with jewels
and has the taut, parchment skin of the repeat visitor to the cosmetic
surgeon; beside her, in all humility, is a woman in the black, old-fashioned
widow's weeds of the Mediterranean peasant.
Nice is a sophisticated city which, like other resorts along this coast,
attracts large amounts of money. It has a reputation for jet-set decadence,
mobsterism and corrupt politics. There are casinos, yacht clubs,
high-society events, social and financial scandals galore. What is nice
about Nice, and makes it quite unlike Cannes, Monaco or St Tropez, is that
at the same time it retains a good deal of the older, simpler Mediterranean
life as well.
After the bright, open Cours Salaya, walking through old Nice's streets and
alleys is like plunging into deep submarine canyons. In odd nooks and
crannies there are obscure shops full of old-fashioned equipment and
merchandise - wood-fired bread ovens, ancient coffee-roasting machines,
jumbles of rope and sailor's sweaters, walking sticks, bird cages. Five
floors up through the gloom, above potted plants on balconies and lines
festooned with drying laundry, is a thin, hard blue crack, the sky.
Lunch. I am trying to discover what a genuine salade Nicoise is. Today's -
sampled in Acchiardo, a simple back-street restaurant better than most on
the glitzy waterfront - bears no resemblance to yesterday's. The only two
constants seem to be anchovies and tiny black olives; after that it is a
free-for-all of tuna, string beans, boiled eggs, tomatoes, lettuce and -
almost - anything else. There is a delicious tiramisu for desert. It is
fattening, but I shall stroll it off this afternoon in the corridors of the
Matisse Museum.
Sunday: Surveying the calm water from my balcony early this morning, I was
surprised to see a dozen or so septagenarian swimmers launch themselves from
the pebbly beach straight out to sea. They began a vigorous crawl that would
have had them in Algiers for lunch, and I was relieved to watch them, at
what seemed a dangerous distance from the shore, finally turn round and head
back.
I had no cause for worry, according to the chambermaid who brought me
cafe-au-lait and buttery croissants for breakfast. Because of its climate,
Nice is full of retired people leading year-round outdoor lives. They are
healthier than I. I am not sure how good all that sun is - their skin looks
like tanned leather - but I determined to take a leaf out of their book. I
decided to lay off Sunday morning socca, and enrich myself spiritually
instead.
Socca is a Nice speciality, a large thin pancake made of chick-pea flower
and olive oil; sprinkled with pepper, it is an addictive snack. The best
place to buy it is from Theresa at the Sunday morning flower market in front
of the Prefecture. With her jet-black hair, crimson lipstick, dangling gipsy
earrings, tight red jumper and dark, flame-throwing eyes, Theresa is a
formidable woman. She also makes formidable socca. Half the men in Nice line
up to buy socca at her stall.
But I wanted spiritual nourishment instead. I began by popping into one or
two of Nice's sumptuous Baroque churches. There is nothing dull about them;
they are so full of intricate plasterwork, marble and gilt that northern
sensibilities might even find them gaudy. Nor is there anything dull about
Marc Chagall's Biblical Message, the 17-canvas chef-d'oeuvre of religious
symbolism I toured at the Chagall Museum. Whimsical images of levitating
goats, flying violins and floating brides are just the thing for a Sunday
morning.
But now, at noon, my resolve has weakened. I think a quick hop up to St
Paul-de-Vence in the hills behind Nice would do me no harm. St Paul has a
well-known restaurant, the Colombe d'Or, made famous by Yves Montand and
Simone Signoret. St Paul has become a summer-time tourist trap. None the
less, it is one of the loveliest medieval stone villages on this coast, and
in winter well worth visiting.
I will not dawdle, though. After lunch I plan to take everyone's favourite
Sunday afternoon walk, a long stroll down the Promenade des Anglais, beside
the roller-skaters and joggers, the Rolls' and mink coats, the palm trees
and the sea. Then, tomorrow, back to London. It is still raining there. But
there is a chance of occasional bright spells.

FT  08 JAN 94 / Skiing: Where the rain clouds have a snowy lining
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARNIE WILSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Could this really be north America's top ski resort? With thick clouds
covering the Canadian mountains and rain beating on my window, it was
difficult to imagine. A few diehard skiers were swimming about at the bottom
of the Wizard Express, wearing see-through plastic coats emblazoned with the
words 'Blackcomb at Whistler' which skiers who want to avoid being drenched
can buy for CDollars 2.
But if you think that any ski resort which dishes out rainwear might have a
struggle to attract customers, you would be wrong. Much to the fury of Vail,
the 'twin-peaks' of Whistler and Blackcomb, already Canada's top ski resort,
have knocked the Colorado resort off its perch as the top ski destination in
north America, according to one magazine survey.
Nevertheless, you do have to be a particular breed of skier to get the best
out of Whistler when the elements are conspiring against you. Whistler is a
resort of paradoxes: at 2,214ft the ski village itself is lower than
Kitzbuhel, one of the lowest major resorts in Europe. Yet with skiing at
over 7,000ft on both Whistler and Blackcomb Mountains, the resort has the
biggest vertical drop in north America.
Whistler is close to Canada's west coast and it is often touch and go
whether precipitation falls as rain or snow on the lower slopes.
From the warmth of my room at the elegant Chateau Whistler Resort hotel it
looked like a day to avoid skiing. And yet the day before, I had braved
exactly the same conditions and enjoyed some of the best skiing in a winter
already crowded with highlights. All it needed was motivation.
Fair-weather skiers miss out on outrageously good skiing and a lot of fun.
Optimists hope that when it is wet in the resort, it could be snowing higher
up. They are often correct. Every time I have heaved myself on to a mountain
in grim weather, I have enjoyed exceptional skiing . . . and returned with
glowing cheeks and well-exercised lungs.
The snow is not always 'champagne powder'. Even Tyax Heliskiing, which
claims in its brochure that 'you will be rewarded with the ultimate prize:
endless powder' admits elsewhere in its literature that heliskiing is
defined 'not as powder skiing but rather as wilderness skiing in untracked
snow'.
During my day in the blizzard, Leanne Hutton, my guide, tried to sort out my
deep-snow technique: 'You should absorb the bumps more. You get away with it
in powder and crud because the deep snow absorbs you]'
After retreating from some otherwise excellent skiing on Blackcomb's
Horstman Glacier after visibility became tricky, we stayed in the trees and
skied lower terrain on both mountains. After a while we hardly noticed that
it was snowing heavily except that as each hour went by the snow became
deeper and the skiing more exhilarating.
On Whistler Mountain, Goat's Gulley, a narrow steep black run with ledges
here and there which made it resemble a series of snow-filled waterfalls,
was particularly enjoyable in deep snow.
The only time we felt miserable rather than elated was riding the chairs. On
Blackcomb's so-called Solar Coaster chair bone-chilling winds pierced our
soaking ski clothes.
A day or two later, we managed to get into Whistler's famous and vast bowl
area, which is frequently closed because of high winds or avalanche danger.
There are six: Glacier Bowl, Sun Bowl, West Bowl, Whistler Bowl, Harmony
Bowl and Burnt Stew Bowl, now re-christened Symphony Bowl (the resort has
been re-considering a number of names. A run called Hooker, a logging term,
now has no name at all. An area called Spankey's is also causing concern.)
Whistler's bowls are all accessed by the Peak Chair. People standing in line
sometimes have a grandstand view of the more hair-brained breed of skier
leaping off steep cliffs above. Ski poles are rattled like sabres and there
is a wild baying, working up to fever pitch as the queue wills the skiers to
leap, hoping for either triumph or tragedy.
There was particular excitement when two skiers inched their way towards the
most spectacular plunge of all: off Jordan's. This involved a 200ft leap on
to such steep terrain that the chances of stopping before being committed to
a further leap of 60ft over rocks were minimal. The first skier had scarcely
gouged a huge hole in the snow after his initial leap than he was hurtling
off on the second jump. As he made another bomb-blast in the snow like a
flattened Tom and Jerry cartoon victim, a huge roar burst from the
lift-queue. Extracting himself from his snowy crater, the skier waved his
poles in the air triumphantly to his audience, who were slightly less
ecstatic when his companion managed to check his momentum and come to a halt
between his two jumps.
There was more drama to come: while I was getting my bearings on Burnt Stew
Trail, an easy path which links the bowls and enables intermediates to glide
around the bowl area, an Australian immigrant, Pete Dize, skiing a steep,
ungroomed part of Harvey's above the trail, triggered a small but
potentially lethal avalanche and fell in its wake. He was swept down to the
path and buried 10 yards from me. With two other skiers, I hurried to dig
him out. Stunned by a blow to his head, he could have 'drowned' if he had
been alone.
On January 1, Arnie Wilson embarked on an FT Round the World Ski Expedition.
Arnie will be sending monthly expedition reports. This article was written
before he set off.
Arnie Wilson travelled to Whistler with Crystal Holidays, Crystal House, The
Courtyard, Arlington Rd, Surbiton, Surrey KT6 6BW. Tel 081-399 5144 and
Canadian Airlines, 2nd floor, Rothschild House, Whitgift Centre, Croydon,
Surrey, CR9 3HN. 0345-616767. He stayed at the Chateau Whistler resort.
Helicopter skiing is available with Tyax Heliskiing (a three-run package
including lunch on the mountain costs CDollars 350) plus weekly packages
which include accommodation, meals, a guide and an avalanche transceiver. An
introductory week costs around CDollars 3,000. A full seven-day package with
100,000 vertical feet of heliskiing costs approximately CDollars 4,690.

FT  08 JAN 94 / Motoring: VW's pollution-beater
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Can a diesel-engined car really cause less atmospheric pollution than a
battery-electric vehicle? It seems unlikely, but according to Volkswagen, it
is true, subject to a couple of qualifications. The diesel car must be a
Golf Ecomatic and the batteries have to be charged with current generated by
burning fossil fuels.
If the power station's boilers are fired with a particularly dirty fuel  -
like some kinds of low-grade coal - the Ecomatic will be even cleaner than a
battery car. Only when it runs on a charge generated by nuclear or
hydro-electricity can a battery car beat the Ecomatic for environmental
friendliness.
The secret of the the Ecomatic's spectacular cleanliness? It works like a
free-wheeling cyclist, using energy only when needed.
Fuel wastage and air pollution are reduced by the engine shutting itself off
when power is not needed to accelerate or maintain speed, or when the car is
standing still.
In essence, the Ecomatic is a normal Golf powered by a 1.9-litre diesel
engine with exhaust catalyser and a five-speed gearbox. It has only
accelerator and brake pedals because the clutch works automatically. When
the driver lifts off the accelerator, the engine cuts out, restarting when
the pedal is pressed.
When I tried an Ecomatic, I found it almost as relaxing as a proper
automatic. It was easier to drive than a car with a normal clutch and much
quieter because, even in moderately heavy traffic, the engine was off more
than on. As a bonus, a light came on to indicate the most economical time to
change up a gear. The result of all this is an achievable urban cycle fuel
consumption of under 51 / 100km, which is close to 60mpg and makes the
Ecomatic almost a teetotaller among cars. Indeed, Britain's offical Warren
Spring environmental laboratory called it the cleanest car it had ever
tested.
The Golf Ecomatic will be on sale later this year. Sadly, it is expected to
cost about Pounds 1,000 more than a normal Golf 1.9-litre diesel because
sophisticated electronic controls and limited production runs do not come
cheaply. In addition to the engine and clutch management electronics, the
Ecomatic needs extra electrical kit to keep the power steering and brake
servo working when the engine is not running. Also, it must have an extra
battery to cope with the power drain of continual re-starting and the use of
headlamps and heated rear window with a dead engine.
The Ecomatic can, of course, be driven long distances at motorway cruising
speeds exactly like the normal diesel car it is, but VW thinks its most
sensible use would be as a town car.
All of which brings me back to the battery-electric cars I was discussing
last week and, specifically, to the large-scale feasability study being
conducted by the French motor industry and the national power generating
company, EDF. Driving a Peugeot 106 battery car in La Rochelle, I had a
taste of motoring's future and I think it really could work, given
application of a legal stick and financial carrot.
The PSA Group (Peugeot-Citroen) has provided 50 battery-electric cars - 25
each of the 106s and Citroen AXs - and EDF has developed a recharging
infrastructure. Batteries which give a range of around 50 miles (80km)
normally are recharged overnight at users' homes. During the day, they can
be perked up in a few hours at points in car parks operated by 'smart'
cards, or given a 15-minute boost - good for another nine-12 miles (15-20km)
 -at Total service stations.
The electric cars are being rented (for around Pounds 100 a month) by such
people as doctors, government officials and businessmen, who will commute in
them to their offices in La Rochelle from their homes up to 25 miles (40km)
away. The rent includes the nickel-cadmium battery pack, which is reckoned
to last for up to 10 years and will eventually cost more than Pounds 5,000,
at today's prices, to replace.
Users pay for their own electricity. A home charge, good for 50 miles
(80km), costs around Pounds 1.25; daytime top-ups come dearer. As a
sweetener, La Rochelle city council is waiving parking charges for battery
car users, although it will not let them use bus lanes or park with impunity
on single yellow lines.
PSA will manufacture up to 5,000 battery-electric 106s and AXs this year. It
thinks that if the authorities increase the heat on city-centre drivers
using cars with petrol or diesel engines, total European production of
electric cars by the year 2000 could be 200,000 units. Of this, PSA might
have a 25 per cent share.
No one spoke about costs because the whole thing is a test marketing
exercise. When a limited number of battery 106s and AXs go on public sale
later this year, they must - unless subsidised - cost more than petrol or
diesel equivalents.
They go remarkably well, though. The 106 I drove was power-steered and, on a
length of dual carriageway, I saw 90kph (56mph) on the speedometer. Tyre
swish apart, it was virtually silent.
It rode like a heavily-laden car (remember those batteries) but was as easy
to drive as a golfer's caddy car. The main problem was avoiding pedestrians
who could not hear it approach.
As a family's second or third car, a battery-electric 106 or AX would have a
lot going for it as a very short-range runabout. But, until vehicles with
internal combustion engines are banned from environmentally sensitive areas
such as city centres, an Ecomatic has to make more sense.
You need only to fill its tank with diesel to drive it non-stop for 500
miles (805km). And you could remind yourself that unless you lived in France
or Switzerland, which produce nearly all their electricity by nuclear or
water power, you would be driving an environmentally cleaner vehicle.

FT  08 JAN 94 / Travel: Let the blossom times roll - Japan's flower parties
intrigue Christopher McCooey
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER MCCOOEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Flower viewing parties do not exactly sound like riotous assemblies of
good-natured drunks, but in Japan that is invariably what they are. Each
spring, when the pink blossoms explode in the branches of the cherry trees,
the Japanese gather underneath them to enjoy both the flowers and
themselves.
Purists may talk aesthetically about the cherry blossoms being the essence
of the Japanese spirit, the epitome of bushido, the spiritual code of the
samurai. Indeed, the cherry blossoms' brief life of emphemeral beauty
reflects purity and simplicity, which are considered traditional Japanese
values. Just as the blossoms fall in their prime, so did the loyal samurai,
who did not hesitate to give, or even take, his own life, even in his prime.
Today some people, from the emperor and the prime minister down, still hold
parties to appreciate the form and colour of cherry blossom as a symbol of
the Japanese spirit, but for the vast majority the cherry blossom parties
are just an excuse for a good time.
For the average salaryman and office lady, the parties are a necessary
pressure valve, a collective release of frustrations and inhibitions that
are a product of Japan's tightly controlled, conformist economic and social
systems.
Cherry blossom viewing parties were already established as annual events in
the reign of Emperor Saga (809-823). This Imperial Court custom probably
derived from the more ancient agricultural practice of taking food and sake
into the fields during the religious festivals that marked the beginning of
spring farm activity.
In the Heian period (794-1185) flower viewing held an important place in
literature, dance and the fine arts. Prior to this, Japan's culture had been
heavily influenced by China, and the flashier peony and the stronger
coloured plum blossoms were more often painted and alluded to in the arts.
But during the Heian period the cherry came to be intimately identified with
Japanese culture, so much so that the word hana (flower) became a synonym
for sakura (cherry). Not only was the flower appreciated but also the wood.
It was used for building, carving and for wood block printing.
The tree of the genus Prunus and the family Rosaceae is native to Japan and
grows wild all over the country. Many of the flowering cherries that grow
around the world are from Japanese stock.
There is a long tradition of outings by family and friends to view the
blossoms in Tokyo. Thousands flock to popular places such as Ueno Park,
Yasukuni Shrine and the Chidorigafuchi Moat with its dramatic backdrop of
pine trees atop the massive stone wall of the Imperial Palace.
For the most popular places, juniors are sent by their company seniors to
stake out pitches under the trees for the after-work party. During the
daytime, parties of retired folk, housewives and students make up the first
shift.
From the time the first trees start to blossom in the southern island of
Kyushu sometime in March, the cherry blossom front moves north and east.
Radio and TV stations broadcast daily reports of the front's progress and
companies, families and groups of friends plan their parties for the few
days (usually only one or two) when the blossoms are at their stunning best.
Cherry blossom stories and photos are run by the media: the man in Osaka who
looked up and up at the blossoms, lost his balance, fell into a ditch and
broke his neck; the 100 tons of garbage collected after one evening in Ueno
Park.
Obnoxious drunks are handled with humour or ignored. Fights are rare,
although one reveller who was drunk stabbed a person to death in Nagoya's
Tsurumai park a few years ago. Generally the revellers regulate their own
behaviour and the police keep a low profile. After the parties are over
vagrants find rich pickings in the half-eaten picnics that are stacked
neatly for collection as trash.
In March and April, parks, shrines and public places with cherry trees
resemble convention sites for well-dressed winos as the normally restrained
Japanese noisily eat and drink, sing and dance under the pink canopy. It is
an amazing sight as red-faced salary men - their shoes off but neatly
arranged at the side (even on a debauch the Japanese are orderly) - prance
and parade in drunken abandon on mats and sheets of cardboard.
The karaoke, literally translated as 'empty orchestra', blares out for each
group. The person with the microphone howls tunelessly while his colleagues
urge him on to greater ignominy. People are expected to make fools of
themselves. Even the company boss will do a turn and sing a bawdy song.
'How long are you in Japan?' asks the delightful drunk who drags you into
his circle of friends.
'How about Japanese rice wine? You must enjoy in Japan.' Indeed, the visitor
who has a strong liver could do no better than follow the cherry blossom
front as it unfolds across the country.
In this Mardi Gras atmosphere a new face to the Japanese may be seen - a
face flushed with alcohol but still warm and friendly. Totally uninhibited,
the Japanese go daft every silly season - every time the cherries blossom.

FT  08 JAN 94 / Travel: A beautiful swamp - James Henderson enjoys the
wildlife of Trinidad's Caroni mangrove
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES HENDERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It took some persuasion to convince me that a trip to a swamp would be the
highlight of my visit to Trinidad. What do you do in 40 square miles of
mangrove and sumptuous black mud? But James Madoo was a salesman who loved
his subject, and I did not reckon with the depth of mystery and the variety
of the Caroni swamp.
Trinidad has an extraordinary variety of birdlife (more than 400 species) in
its 1,800 square miles of coastal swamps, plains and forested mountains.
'Iere,' the old Indian name for Trinidad, meant 'Land of the Hummingbird,'
and there are 16 species on the island.
Aerodynamically they have about as much chance of flying as a helicopter. In
their efforts to keep airborne they must beat their wings about 50 times a
second. Their metabolic rate is so high that they must constantly top up
with nectar. At night, hummingbirds switch off and become stiff as a wooden
board.
Trinidad lies on a migratory route and so, not unlike the tourists,
thousands of birds flock there from the US and Canada each year to avoid the
northern winter. Many other species have spilled over from South America,
just seven miles away. These are truly exotic, adorned with bright tropical
colours and quirks of nature that only their mates could possibly find
attractive.
Some are designed for perfect flying, with built-in aerofoils and spoilers;
others are lumbered with ridiculous encumbrances. The poor wattled jacana
has silly-looking, overlong toes and an embarrassing red splurge on its
face. And just imagine having the bill of a toucan.
The diminutive male white bearded mannikin spends 90 per cent of its waking
hours displaying itself. It flits backwards and forwards, all to entice
female mannikins to its court. Deeper in the rain forest there is a bird
that strikes up chucka-chucka-chucka-chucka, like an unsuccessful
starter-motor, and another that calls boing, boing . . . boing. Heaven knows
what a violaceous trogon does back at the nest.
Of all the mournful, sceptical, quizzical-looking birds you see on the
island, the most majestic is the scarlet ibis, and it was this I went to see
in Caroni swamp. I travelled by mini-bus, or, as the contrary Trinidadians
prefer to call it, a maxi-taxi - more a mobile discotheque than a bus. The
carnival rhythms pumped relentlessly on, but soon the bustle of Port of
Spain receded and the overwhelming greens of the Trinidad countryside loomed
around us.
At the swamp I met Winston Nanan, a stocky and quietly-spoken man. His
knowledge of Trinidadian wildlife is encyclopaedic. He began by telling us
of the swamp and its fragile ecosystem, of the 168 species of bird that can
be seen there and of the efforts being made to protect them. Anecdotes,
including hair-raising stories of disturbing armed poachers, were drawn from
30 years of swamp life.
We set off into the mangroves. James Madoo accelerated the outboard for a
moment and then left the boat to cruise as we listened. Suddenly, with a
splash, a spectacled cayman pushed off into the water and cruised away with
lazy movements of its tail.
A mangrove tree can cover whole acres. It is an endless tangle of brown
roots, sprouting willy-nilly from the mud, miniature flying buttresses run
riot topped with bushy leaves.
As we crept into each new spot, the favoured haunt of a particular species,
the peace would take a moment to return, but soon the birds would appear.
With a cock of the head the guides held our attention.
The swamp started to come alive. A white-necked heron stood perched on one
foot in a stretch of open water, shoulders hunched and immobile, as it had
been for hours (except occasionally to change legs), waiting to strike for
food. Skulking around the edge, a green-backed heron preferred to stalk,
holding its body horizontal over the water.
A lonesome boop-boop-boop rang out - a clapper rail - and a second later a
little character with a spiked haircut (called topknot) flitted past with a
grating hiss: a yellow-bellied elaenia. It fled shamelessly at the
appearance of a fearsome tiger heron. Suddenly, the wattled jacana's
rebellious toes made sense - they were perfect for keeping balance over
lilies.
As evening drew in we made our way to the scarlet ibis sanctuary. Moments
later the first pair breezed in, a flash of red as they flapped and landed.
Scarlet ibises are gregarious creatures, and as many as 5,000 return
nightly, after feeding in Venezuela, to roost in the mangroves.
The ibises are impossibly red, the strongest scarlet, like a British
postbox. The colour derives from the chemical carotin, which they find in
the little crustaceans in the swamp. They stand about 3ft high, with wings
3ft when outstretched; their 8in bills curve downwards.
For a while, as well as being Trinidad's national bird, the scarlet ibis was
also something of a national dish, and in the 1960s numbers were dangerously
low (they were also hunted for their feathers). Away from their own
environment, or in captivity, ibis fade to a dull pink, a wan reminder of
the real thing. Now that they have some protection in the sanctuary, they
have returned to the swamp to roost and have started to breed again.
The mating season lasts from the end of April into June, when you will see
pairs flying high, descending in ever- decreasing circles before they
disappear behind a curtain of mangrove leaves. Nesting lasts until August.
Soon there were 50 ibis in the air at a time, gliding in above us.
Momentarily a tree would burst aflame as they stretched their wings to the
full, flapping and settling. In the golden evening light the mangroves,
flecked white with the cattle egrets, took on a deep scarlet glow.
But it faded with the dusk. The oysters on the mangrove roots snapped shut
for the night and we returned home.

FT  08 JAN 94 / Travel: Rewards of straying from the Silk Route - Giles
Whittell visits Samarkand and follows impossibly exotic branches of a road
which has not changed for 1,000 years over some of its stretches
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILES WHITTELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'I AM REGISTAN,' the loudspeakers bellowed, as purple and orange lights
blinked at Samarkand's three great medieval madrasas. A handful of tourists
gazed at them from a tier of plastic seating. The loudspeakers droned on
about something to do with Lenin's flag and Uzbek pride, but I doubt if
anyone was listening.
The Registan is the most breathtaking architectural ensemble on the Silk
Route. No-one had recorded a new soundtrack for the son et lumiere, but it
didn't seem to matter. Not even Soviet pseudo-history can demean these
monuments to the wealth accumulated in 14th-century Samarkand by Tamerlane.
Timur-the-lame, self-styled heir to Genghis Khan, did not build them
himself. What he did was force all Silk Route trade to pass through
Samarkand by ransacking Urgench, its northern rival near the Aral sea. He
also liked to display the heads of prisoners on stakes where these Islamic
seminaries now stand.
His grandson, Ulug Bek, commissioned the first of them in 1417 and smothered
it in acres of blue and green mosaic. The two imitations that went up 200
years later are less pure as pieces of Islamic art, but no less impressive.
The portal of the Shir Dor madrasa resorts blasphemously to mosaic lions in
order to impress, while deep within the Tilla Kari madrasa several kilos of
gold shimmer from the ceiling of the Golden Mosque, and you would have to be
a dry old Islamicist not to ooh and aah at it.
Tour operators are queueing to take you to former Soviet central Asia, and
Samarkand, second city of Uzbekistan, is the place they hope to have you
drooling over. It is certainly worth a visit. From the Registan you can walk
past the tea-houses of Tashkent Street to the bazaar and the massive,
brooding remains of Tamerlane's Bibi Khanym mosque.
There is also Gur Emir, the terrible warlord's mausoleum. Legend has it that
someone etched inside his coffin the words 'If I am roused the earth will
tremble.' Five-and-a-half centuries later a Soviet scientist exhumed the
body. It was the night of June 22, 1941, and within minutes of the coffin
being opened an assistant rushed into the crypt with the news that Hitler
had invaded Russia.
There is much to shiver and marvel at in Samarkand, but it would be a waste
to come all this way and not do some exploring. What is new in central Asia
is the chance to stray away from Intourist's beaten track - from those
branches of the so-called Silk Route that are now Tarmac to those which have
not changed in 1,000 years.
Start by looking south from the site of Ulug Bek's observatory. (Ulug Bek
used astronomy to calculate the length of the year to within a few seconds,
nearly two centuries before Copernicus was born.) From here, on a clear day,
you can see the snows of the Zerafshan mountains marching into the desert
along a highway of haze.
Where you are standing, the temperature is probably close to 40'C, and the
traffic fumes catch in your throat. Up there, you imagine, there are perfect
valleys full of wild flowers and pristine air. You have to go and see.
I joined an up-market, guided trek to the Fan massif, the highest in the
Zerafshan range. It seemed the sensible option because these mountains are
in Tajikistan, which was in the grip of civil war. The group included an
86-year-old who assured us he would be fine at altitude because he kept in
shape on Sundays, on Dartmoor, with the Teignmouth branch of the Ramblers'
Association. There was also a distinguished Foreign Office KCMG who told me
on our first evening together that he loathed journalists.
We crossed the Tajik border, very peacefully, in a minibus. At the ancient
Sogdian city of Pendzhikent we transferred to a mountain-going truck which
broke down soon after entering the mountains. Bunny, the octogenarian,
impressed everyone by getting out and walking.
As we gained height, tobacco patches gave way to juniper forest. The path
narrowed and the gradient stiffened and Bunny changed down a gear or two.
Raw horizons of rock and ice closed in to the west and the south. The air
grew cold and thin and space was found for Bunny on a donkey. (This was
cushy trekking; a small herd of donkeys carried everything except our
sunhats.)
That night, round a camp fire of 100-year-old juniper logs, the donkey
drivers gave a spirited recital of Tajik mountain songs. KCMG and I replied
with Mud, Mud, Glorious Mud and Jerusalem.
The following day we crossed the watershed between Samarkand and Dushanbe.
Bunny reached it leaning back on his donkey like a stunt-rider. It took four
men to stop him falling off, but when he said the view was 'more spectacular
than Dartmoor' it seemed worth the trouble.
We camped at a place that used up all our superlatives. The grass had been
clipped to a sward by mountain goats. The tents were sheltered by low rises
dotted with boulders and cedar trees. The sun set over a sequence of
miniature lakes strung out below us, and not far to the south a sheer wall
of snow and rock reared up two vertical kilometres. We asked for more songs
but the donkey men had found some heroin poppies and made tea with them.
They were still blotto in the morning.
We were told by our chief guide, Kolya, a quiet Russian alpinist who has
raised walking to an art-form, that our path was a genuine strand of the
Silk Route: the main route south from Samarkand right up to the 1950s.
Maybe. It is true that the Silk Route had variants, but it is also true that
every road in central Asia turns out to be ex-Silk Route if you let the tour
guide pause for breath.
The origin of this impossibly exotic camel track is well-documented. In 138
BC a Chinese general called Chang Ch'ien travelled to Fergana (east of
Samarkand in present-day Uzbekistan) to buy some horses that were said to
run so fast they sweated blood. The general found that in fact they bled
because of a skin parasite. But he also learned that Fergana's merchants
would pay a very handsome price for silk. His emperor, Wu-ti, thereupon
lifted an export ban which had been in force since the Chinese started
weaving silk around 2000 BC, and trading began.
Chang Ch'ien had crossed the Tien Shan (the Heavenly Mountains) between
Kashgar and what is now the Kirghiz town of Uzgen. Join the dots. This is
the original Silk Route. You cannot follow it because 20th-century politics
mean there is no road. But you can cross the mountains not far north, along
the arduous road through Kirghizstan to Torugart, from where Chinese jeeps
leave for Kashgar.
An hour or two before the Chinese border there is a turning to a place
called Tash Rabat. Take it. Do not on any account roar past in a cloud of
dust as the Paris-Beijing rally did last year. At the end of a track, lost
in the mountains, Tash Rabat is a grand old granite caravanserai that was
sheltering Kashgari traders since before Tamerlane was thought of.
You can camp beside it and hike up to Asia's continental divide, or hunt
ibex with the lonely caretaker. Whatever you do, it will evoke the real Silk
Route better than a Soviet sound and light show.

FT  08 JAN 94 / Practical Traveller: Budapest - spa city
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA ROBERTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Turks, abandoning Budapest to the Austrian Army in 1686, must have
looked with regret at what they were leaving. Buda was not only a
long-standing outpost of the Ottoman Empire but a place well-endowed with
natural springs - subterranean fountains that fed a network of Turkish
baths.
Today, 500,000 cubic meters of water percolate daily through the city's
limestone-rich soil, filling 31 medicinal baths and open-air pools and
making Budapest one of the world's great spa cities. Do not be misled by the
word 'spa'. A spa is merely a mineral spring or hotel built around springs;
luxury is not a requisite.
This is certainly true with Budapest. On the other hand, its springs
certainly have what it takes: calcium, magnesium, fluoride, sulfates,
alkalies, even radium. This combination, known to treat inflammation as well
as respiratory problems, is what makes Budapest's water so prized.
Well-being is not the only reason for a spa visit. The architecture, from
16th-century Turkish baths to turn-of-the- century resorts, is as
fascinating as the water is therapeutic.
Although there are more than 30 spas, the number includes summer swimming
pools and modern clinics. For the real thing, you need only to focus on a
handful of locations.
My favourite is the Gellert Hotel and medicinal baths, a belle-epoque
monstrosity which seems to float like a wedding cake on the Buda end of
Liberty Bridge. The Gellert dates from 1918 and is the city's only remaining
'old world' resort-spa.
The hotel partly faces the Danube and, although billed as one of Budapest's
finest (Pounds 132 per double room, spa included), is in need of upgrading
from its present no-frills, socialist-era decor. Hotel guests reach the spa
by private elevator; the paying public enters separately.
There are some strange treatments available, but stick to the Gellert's
basics: thermal baths (men and women separately); outdoor wave pool and
indoor swimming pool. Avoid the manicure and pedicure and take a massage at
your own risk (it is a few slaps short of torture). To make your visit
easier, take some coins for tipping and learn a few words, like furdo
(bath), gozfurdo (thermal bath) and kijarat (exit).
Unwind first in the thermal baths. Both men's and women's baths are
elaborately decorated. Leaving the baths, grab a new towel and take a cold
plunge or change into a swimsuit for the indoor pool.
This naturally carbonated, glass-roofed pool was added in 1934 and echoes
the Roman baths of Caracalla. I expected a sunny, lively room, but there was
too much cloud cover that day. The detailing, however, is stunning: carved
marble columns flank the pool and rise to a palm-tree-lined balcony. The
Gellert baths close at 8pm on weekdays, 2pm Saturdays and 1pm Sundays. The
indoor pool closes at 7pm, except Sundays (4pm).
The Szechenyi Baths in City Park is one of the grandest bathing houses in
Europe, attracting 2m people a year. The thermal baths are elegant but even
better are the three outdoor thermal pools (hottest 38'C). Here you will
witness Budapest's famous postcard vignette in living colour: bathers
standing in the water, playing chess on cork boards.
The domes of Budapest's remaining 16th century Turkish baths are still
scattered among the Baroque architecture of Buda's neighbourhoods. At the
foot of Elizabeth Bridge you cannot miss the hemi-spherical cupola of the
Rudas Bath, known for its green columns and radioactive water which clients
drink to boost circulation.
Continuing towards Margaret Island you will be transported back to the
Ottoman Empire by the four crescent-topped domes of the Kiraly Baths, built
in 1566. Here, history seems to hang on the vapors. It is not hard to
picture Turkish pashas immersed in reverie as invading troops pummel the
city walls, ending forever Budapest's entanglement with the Sultanate.

FT  08 JAN 94 / Travel: An unspoilt getaway - Gordon Robison visits Asir, a
Saudi tourist region devoid of tourists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GORDON ROBISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Imagine a remote region of heavily forested mountains and valleys; of
villages untouched by tourism where much of the traditional architecture has
been preserved and is in everyday use; where camels and wild monkeys are
common sights.
Imagine, too, that this remote region is served by an immaculately
maintained network of uncongested roads, highways and airports and that it
offers both food and accommodation to suit any budget with standards of
hygiene and medical care that any European would envy.
There is such a place; the Asir mountains of western Saudi Arabia. The
problem is that Saudi restrictions mean that unless you work in Saudi
Arabia, or have business there, or are a Saudi (or citizen of another Gulf
state), you almost certainly cannot visit this region. Thus Asir may enjoy
the strange distinction of being the world's best-developed tourist region
that you (probably) cannot visit. You will have to hope that things change.
For several years Saudia, Saudi Arabia's national airline, has been
promoting Asir as a tourist destination for the internal market. Several of
the region's main hotels offer weekend packages and a few tour operators
have arranged itineraries covering several of the region's cities.
The Asir mountains are part of a much longer chain stretching north to
Jordan and south through Yemen. To the west they drop sharply away to the
Red Sea. To the east they trail off into a series of hills and plateaus
which eventually disappear into the desert.
It is a region where the roads hug the sides of tree-covered mountains as
one moves between villages where the culture is closer to that of Yemen than
to the cosmopolitan port of Jeddah or the Bedouin traditions of Riyadh.
In winter Asir belies the popular image of Arabia as a place of ferocious,
never-ending summers. The mountains can be subject to heavy rains and often
spend months locked in thick but highly local fogs.
Most activity in Asir centres on the provincial capital of Abha, which until
1922 was the capital of a small independent kingdom. In that year Asir was
conquered by Abdul Aziz Ibn Abdel Rahman Al-Saud (usually called Ibn Saud in
the west), the founder of modern Saudi Arabia. Abha later became a base for
Abdul Asiz's attacks on the Hejaz, north of Asir where Mecca and Medina are
located. Abha is a small, functional town with only one real point of
interest.
This is the Shada Palace; it was built in 1927 and served for two
generations as the regional seat of government. Since 1987 it has been open
to the public as a museum of Asiri culture. The palace is a three-storey mud
brick building with a sitting area on the roof. Many such buildings can be
seen along almost any road through the Asir countryside, although in the
centre of Abha the palace itself has become an architectural anomaly.
Aside from the scenery and the architecture, one of Asir's main selling
points is altitude. At just over 2,200 metres, Abha provides respite for
those weary of summer's sweltering heat in Jeddah or Riyadh.
Another prime attraction is Asir national park, designed for the Saudis by a
team from the US national park service. The protected area encompassed by
the park is enormous, taking in thousands of square kilometres of land in
and around the Asir mountains and stretching west to the Red Sea.
The park's facilities are well-laid out, although visiting them is not
straight-forward. Take the visitor's centre, a series of displays on the
park's plants, animals, geography and culture located in a building adjacent
to Abha's ring road. The building is in beautifully landscaped gardens where
it blends easily with the surrounding mountains. The centre includes an
observation deck overlooking the valley just below. Wild monkeys native to
the region can often be seen in the grounds.
But first you have to get into the centre. It is open only on summer
evenings and entrance is restricted to families. In Saudi Arabia this means
'couples' and 'unaccompanied women,' with or without children. Males wanting
to view the exhibits and lacking a female and/or juvenile escort must obtain
a permit. In winter, everyone needs a permit.
A far easier way to approach the park is via the tours and packages offered
by the Abha Inter-Continental Hotel. Even if you are staying in the youth
hostel (they are open only to men), a trip to the hotel for a look at the
massive lobby is a must.
Originally built as a palace for one of Saudi Arabia's numerous princes, the
hotel sits in the heart of the park, near the summit of Jebel Sawdah, at
3,115m the highest point in the country.
Anomalously, Asir is a tourist region devoid of tourists. As a result, it
remains largely unknown to the outside world.

FT  08 JAN 94 / Travel: Food drink, culture - and exercise - Patti Waldmeir
puts both feet forward on a ramble through southern Tuscany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There are many things to hate about long-distance rambling, especially
abroad. The foreign footpath is inevitably - nay maliciously - badly
waymarked, and the foreign farmer too often raises a sadistic chuckle with
electric fencing and bulls.
Then there are more mundane concerns: whatever your choice of picnic, it is
always hot or sodden by lunchtime; the rucksack is crushingly heavy, no
matter what you leave behind; worst, there is no way out once you've
started. Only masochists need apply.
But even if your flaws do not run to masochism, there is still hope.
Alternative Travel Group, an Oxford-based tour company, conducts foreign
rambling holidays for those who see walking as the best form of sightseeing.
I think it was at lunch on the first day of the ATG tour of southern Tuscany
 -or maybe at dinner the first evening - that I realised what I was in for:
10 days of the best in food, drink, scenery, culture and exercise, every one
of them dedicated to pleasure.
Towards that end, ATG ramblers are relieved of the need to carry a rucksack:
luggage is transported by van, and awaits the tired walker in their room at
day's end. That is not unique. Other tour companies offer luggage service.
But ATG also solves the picnic problem - something other tour companies seem
to ignore.
I never saw a cheese sandwich or cold sausage roll. Instead, we had stylish,
colourful salads (one of my favourites: endive, yellow pepper and peach),
the pungent Pecorino cheese (without the unpleasant sweat generated by hours
in a rucksack), homemade sausage or cured ham, several kinds of local bread,
fresh fruit and wine.
On the one day we had heavy rain, we straggled in at lunchtime to find Kit -
our versatile tour manager - sheltering in a sort of barn, with succour for
the wet and miserable: a big pot of soup and lots of red wine.
The dinners were worth a trip on their own. As we limped to table each
evening, expectancy soon overcame exhaustion: each was a special meal
arranged with local restaurants by Kit, eager to show off the Tuscan
specialities which she so clearly adored. And the size of the meals provided
ample incentive for a vigorous long walk the next day. Although I scarcely
turned down a mouthful of food, and indulged my taste for local red wines, I
walked off every ounce of added weight during the day.
Unlike most of the guests, who had more sense, I walked every inch of the
way from the walled village of Montepulciano to stunning medieval Siena,
some 90-odd miles. But I am sure I enjoyed it more because I knew I could
opt out, if so inclined, for ATG provides the ultimate antidote to
masochism: a chance to be picked up by the van, half way . . . or a third of
the way . . . or before the last hill . . . and without adverse moral
judgments from our enthusiastic, Italophile tour leader, Frances.
To her goes the credit for infallible path-finding and cultured commentary
on the medieval hill towns which bejewelled our path, and for stunning
itineraries which took in - on one special day - a Romanesque church with
naif sculptures above the church door; a dip in the thermal baths of Bagna
Vignoni; lunch at Ripa d'Orcia, a privately-owned castle on a dramatic bluff
above the Orcia river - and a chance to take a van ride home before the last
steep hill.
However unreasonable the request, Frances and Kit were eager to meet it. ATG
tours are not cheap. My 10-day tour of southern Tuscany, without airfare,
cost Pounds 1,270, and that was only after I protested at being charged the
US dollar price quoted for overseas bookings: Dollars 2,500. But for the
hedonist who likes a fair bit of exercise on the side, the price is worth
it. Luxury rambling: for the traveller who has everything.

FT  08 JAN 94 / How to Spend It: Positive thinking to beat the blues - Sarah
Stacey finds some pleasant ways to shake that after-Christmas feeling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARAH STACEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As the new year gets underway anyone without the willpower of a Trappist
monk may be feeling a touch under par. The long days of feasting, combined
with lack of sleep and exercise, result in what the French call une crise de
foie - in other words, an overloaded liver exacerbated by dehydration.
This sluggishness is also primarily responsible for the January blues,
according to Dr Susan Horsewood-Lee, a London general practitioner who is
particularly interested in nutrition. The answer, she says, is a programme
of detoxification, rehydration and relaxation.
If that conjures visions of pills, potions and deprivations, take heart. Of
course, you can go the whole way and opt for a lemon and water fast - under
medical supervision only - but there are gentler and positively agreeable
ways of tackling this lethargy.
First, let us suppose you want to detox at home. Undoubtedly the best way to
start the day is with pure water, warm or cool, not ice-cold, or herbal tea.
Peppermint has been used to aid digestion since Roman times. Add a dribble
of cold-pressed honey if you wish.
Next, try a brisk skin brushing to get your circulation moving and speed the
loss of toxins. Use a fairly stiff brush, (the Body Shop version at Pounds
4.95 is perfect) on dry skin, always working up legs and arms towards the
heart.
Follow with a hot shower, perhaps using a herbal hair and body shampoo such
as Aveda's aromatic Futurity Relax, oozing with camomile, comfrey and witch
hazel. Finish with a cold, or cool, splash from head to toe. It is
gasp-inducing at first, but makes you feel sparkling throughout the day.
The bottom line with detox eating and drinking is to do it gently. If you
can manage one or two days without caffeine and alcohol, largely eating
fruit and vegetables, you will feel great benefits. Although beware,
expelling toxins from an overloaded system can temporarily induce headaches
or other aches and pains, dizziness and a degree of lassitude. The best way
to combat this is to drink as much cool, pure water as possible, two to five
pints daily, submerge yourself in warm baths and rest.
Dr Horsewood-Lee also recommends taking a multivitamin and mineral
supplement. The Japanese would add Chlorella, emerald green algae which is
stuffed with nutrients and Japan's best selling supplement. It is available
in tablet or powder form and, like a wide range of other supplements, a
positive library of books and some health foods, is stocked by the
Nutricentre, which also has a very efficient mail order service. Contact the
Nutricentre at 7 Park Crescent, London WIN 3HE. Tel: 071-436-5122.
Now for the good news. Massage of all kinds is excellent for releasing
toxins, used in combination with diet and gentle exercise such as walking
and swimming. Aromatherapy massage, with essential oils such as juniper,
rosemary and grapefruit, is a powerful detoxifier, working on the lymphatic
system, boosting the vital organs, and helping the digestion.
From January 4, Aromatherapy Associates, the company which ministers to the
Princess of Wales, is offering a 10 per cent discount on treatments in the
middle of the day. Normal prices are Pounds 40 for the 1 3/4 hour initial
consultation, Pounds 35 for 1 1/4 hr follow-ups. It also supplies mail order
bath oils (65ml for Pounds 19.95, plus Pounds 2 p&amp;p). Contact: Aromatherapy
Associates at 68 Maltings Place, Bagleys Lane, SW6 2BY. Tel: 071-371-9878.
Alas, it only looks after women.
The International Federation of Aromatherapists, (081-846-8066), provides a
national list of practitioners, who may also do home visits. Some
practitioners will only treat women, although those based in health clubs
and health hydros will usually treat men as well.
If you like massage and water, try Thalgo hydrotherapy. Our jaded tester
emerged from a session at Harrods' revamped Hair and Beauty Salon
revitalised. She began to feel better when her body was exfoliated with a
mallow and ivy scrub. Plunged into a large tub, laced with seaweed extract,
our tester felt a rapid improvement as high-pressure jets of water pummelled
her from neck to sole for about half an hour. A deep body massage topped it
off and sent her tripping into Knightsbridge. Thalgo detoxifying
hydrotherapy costs Pounds 40 for one hour as does the seaweed body wrap. You
might like to follow it with a facial treatment and scalp massage, such as
the Clarins Paris Method lymphatic drainage facial, Pounds 45.
Harrods Hair &amp; Beauty Salon is offering a special deal to Weekend FT readers
from now until January 31 - for Pounds 60 you can have either a Thalgo
Hydrotherapy bath or a relaxing body massage plus a full face facial, neck
and shoulder massage. Just say you are an FT reader and the offer stands.
For a more baroque treatment, you could try the Dead Sea Inchwrap. For
Pounds 50, plus VAT, you can be exfoliated with bright blue gel, painted in
Dead Sea Mud and swaddled in cling film from jaw to toe, until you look like
a sci-fi mummy. As the name implies, you may lose some inches, but the
minerals in the black mud are also said to draw out toxins, as well as
emulsifying fat, reducing cellulite, improving muscle tone and generally
revitalising the skin. Our tester felt invigorated after the treatment. A
few inches were indeed knocked off her vital statistics and several pounds
off her weight, albeit temporarily. For local therapists, contact Finders
International on 0580-211-055.
For those whose willpower may flag, Grayshott Hall health and fitness
retreat specialises in individually designed detox programmes. Diets are
based on vegetables, salads and fruit, with a little protein. Light
exercise, such as swimming or walking is advised to speed the process.
Grayshott, which comes with high commendations from doctors and those who
have stayed there, also provides massage, hydrotherapy and spa body
treatments. A single room for four nights costs from Pounds 525, including
all meals, a daily massage and heat treatment, and one-to-one health and
nutritional consultations. Grayshott Hall, Headley Road, Grayshott, Nr
Hindhead, Surrey GU26 6JJ. Tel: 0428-604-331, fax: 0428-605-463.
Lady de Saumarez, owner of Shrubland Hall, is adamant that this elegant
Georgian house, set in magically beautiful Italian gardens, is a health
clinic 'not a hotel with treatments'. Three doctors are there day and night.
The emphasis is on cleansing the system, diet is a treatment, and everyone
is treated as a patient. On his first evening, workaholic TV producer Clive
Syddall found his dinner diet of orange juice, yoghurt and honey, an
appalling prospect. Over the next few days, the benefits were so great - and
the myriad relaxing treatments, which included a wide range of therapies
plus amenities such as art lessons, so pleasant - that he voted it entirely
worthwhile.
Ages range from eight to 80. Staff, who outnumber guests, are sympathetic
and standards are high. During three days of detox and relaxation, Syddall
lost several pounds, and left feeling 'much refreshed and lighter . . . it
gives you the impetus to continue with a good diet and make time to relax'.
Single rooms range from Pounds 420 to Pounds 650 per week. For more details,
contact Shrubland Hall Health Clinic, Coddenham, lpswich, Suffolk lP6 9QH.
Tel: 0473-830-404, fax: 0473-832-641.
On mainland Europe, detoxifying at thalassotherapy spas is regularly
prescribed by doctors. French friends become lyrical when describing the
effects of a week's stay at the Institute of Thalassotherapy at Le Touquet
on the north-west coast of France. Easily accessible from Britain, the spa
is right on the beach. Treatment regimes are planned individually,
alternating half days of therapy with periods of rest.
Erna Low Consultants, which specialises in spa travel, offers a package to
Le Touquet of six nights with half board and three to five treatments daily,
starting from Pounds 570 for a shared twin room, Pounds 729 for a single
room. Flights Pounds 89 return. Contact Erna Low at 9 Reece Mews, London SW7
3HE. Tel: 071-584-2841.
Dr Horsewood-Lee recommends Helianthal, the wonderfully located spa at St
Jean de Luz, in the south of France, as ideal for detoxing. It offers
excellent cuisine under your personal nutritional adviser, a gym, and 'a
dream of a salt water swimming pool' with hydrotherapy. Tel: 010-33 59 51 51
51.
Finally, Chinese medicine links the state of your liver with how happy you
are. A poorly functioning liver means that the vital chi, or energy, is
restricted, leading to depression, anxiety and lack of joy. For a list of
qualified TCM practitioners, write to the Chinese Herbal Medicine Register,
PO Box 400, Wembley, Middlesex, HA9 9NZ, enclosing a large self addressed
stamped envelope and a Pounds 1.50 cheque or postal order.

FT  08 JAN 94 / Fashion: Watch, wait, pounce - Avril Groom says clever
shoppers know how to use the sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AVRIL GROOM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The most undignified sale I ever saw was a private one, at the showroom of a
top British designer. Women who usually meet smiling over the champagne
glasses were snatching frocks from each other's grasp and building up
stashes of possible bargains. Any garment tried and deemed unsuitable was
tossed aside after which they returned to the fray in their lingerie.
My initial reaction was to feel comforted that even well-known actresses
wear holey vests and greying bra straps. My second, more disquieting one,
was to wonder why women needed to behave in that way. But that was in the
mid 1980s, when money was more easy come, easy go and sales were the tinsel
on the tree. It hardly mattered what you bought, as long as it had a good
markdown on the price tag and the right designer name on the label.
Those were the days when the media faithfully recorded the queue of people
camped outside Selfridges in Oxford Street and the crashing crockery in the
crush at the start of Harrods' sale. Now it is all much less jolly.
The media still goes to Harrods - but to film the latest celebrity brought
in by the store's promotions department to keep the sales excitement alive.
This week it was American film actor Richard Gere, who generated a large and
noisy crowd. But serious shoppers are a more dour bunch who bide their time
with an end in view, rather than trippers out for fun and a few
unpremeditated bargains.
Recession has both debased the sales and made them the main source of
shopping for many. Now that half the high street has permanent sale notices
there is no need to wait to buy unless you want something absolutely
specific; the chances are that somewhere you will find an acceptable
equivalent already reduced. Those keenly anticipated sales just after
Christmas and in late June have become irrelevant. Many sales start in
mid-December to cash in on seasonal trade.
But for those who do want a specific item, the starting dates of the
remaining genuine store sales have more significance than ever. Harrods says
selling has been slow in recent years, yet its sales have been remarkably
successful. The first day of last January's was its best trading day.
The recession has concentrated the mind of the intelligent shopper. The only
justification for a sale is saving money, not spending it, by enabling
consumers to buy much-coveted items at prices they consider reasonable when
the original price seemed unreasonable. The strong-minded watch, wait, case
the joint and then pounce. They discover in advance how much the sale
reduction will be. The even stronger-minded then wait for more, hoping for
further reductions but risking the sale of their bargain.
This is all nerve-racking stuff but the dedicated sales shopper has never
been faint-hearted. Now that people are more prepared, of necessity, to play
the waiting game, the atmosphere is coolly competitive rather than frenetic.
Real strength of mind comes in the reckoning with yourself over what you
buy. The best bargains are lasting, quality classics, in fashion terms an
easier brief for men than women, although items such as a half-price
Aquascutum cashmere coat, a Mulberry briefcase or a Pringle cashmere sweater
seem to fit the bill, and all are in sales now.
Another approach is to go to the sales of top, very expensive designers  -
Chanel and Ralph Lauren (both start today) are fashion Meccas at sale time -
and hope their innate taste and elegance carry you through. But beware. Even
here there are design duds and they naturally have the biggest markdowns.
Buying fashion hits in a sale is trickier but more fun because a wardrobe
full of serious investments would be a dull place. Go for quality and
clothes you can visualise wearing in the future - even if styled in a
totally different way. And you have to be tough with yourself.
For instance, velvet has been the fabric of the season - which is precisely
why it will not be next winter. Yet, I can still justify buying Margaret
Howell's long black velvet skirt (sale now on) because it is so simple and
beautiful it will be a classic. I can even justify Martin Margiela's evening
sheath of crinkled metallic silver with deconstructed raw-edge details (from
Browns, sale starts today) because it is so startling that it is above the
whims of fashion.
But much as I would love to own one of Vivienne Westwood's corset tops (sale
late January) I must draw the line. Occasions where 18th century ball gear
is appropriate are rare in my life. And although it would do incredible
things for my figure, even at sale prices it is too much to pay to make
mountains out of molehills.

FT  08 JAN 94 / Minding Your Own Business: Rewards of the door-to-door
salesman - Peter Marsh meets Mike Shirley who gave up cabbage picking to
sell double glazing. He earns Pounds 80,000 a year and loves his work
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is a cold December morning and Mike Shirley is at work, knocking on
people's doors. He is outside a big, solid house in Nottingham. Plenty of
windows, paintwork wearing thin. Just the place to sell some double glazing.
Someone is in. Shirley is polite and to the point: he will be in the area
again tomorrow and has a slot in his diary. Would the lady and her husband
like an appointment to discuss having their windows replaced?
Shirley loves his routine. He is one of Britain's most successful
double-glazing salesmen, his main tools are the leaflets under his arm, the
samples of glass and plastic in the boot of his Volvo, an indefatigable
nature and an interest in psychology.
As well as selling, Shirley also has to supervise 10 sales representatives
who also work his area of the east Midlands. These people, Shirley included,
are self-employed and earn no basic salary. All their earnings are related
to sales.
Shirley's wages are worked out according both to his performance and that of
the men under him. This gives him an incentive to keep them motivated
through schemes which he organises - including prizes for the 'salesman of
the month' and weekend trips to encourage a team spirit.
The strategy seems to work. Shirley earns up to Pounds 80,000 a year - not
bad for a 36-year-old former army gunner turned vegetable picker who moved
into double glazing 10 years ago. But to maintain this level of earnings
Shirley, who has five children aged between six and 18, works 80 hours a
week.
Shirley and his men work for Everest, one of Britain's biggest double
glazing companies. This supplies them with promotional literature and basic
training - and leaves them to get on with selling its windows, doors and
related products from their homes. The strategy makes sense for the company,
cutting out overheads such as offices, phone rentals and secretaries, and
may also be good for consumers, who pay less for their products.
In Britain one in eight people in work is self-employed, compared with one
in 14 in 1979. Some argue that rewarding people solely on the basis of sales
or production figures can be demeaning and cause individuals to work too
hard. But Shirley has no complaints. He says self-employment gives him not
only job satisfaction but 'total control' over what he earns.
Shirley moved into the window business after tiring of his back-breaking
work picking cabbages. He used a phone box to respond to a newspaper
advertisement for salesmen. He was told to ring again when he had a phone at
home. 'I went out and got one,' says Shirley. 'It forced me to sort out
priorities.'
Shirley knocks on up to 40 doors a day, travelling an average of 140 miles
in his 'patch' which is centred on Grantham.
He is a keen student of behaviour. 'Before you sell to anyone, you've got to
sell yourself, make them feel comfortable,' he says. 'You've got to be able
to 'read' them, understand their body language. Every day you learn
something new.'
Selling, says Shirley, is a 'numbers game'. Over time - assuming a salesman
is working at full potential - a set level of sales will follow a specific
number of calls.
On average, says Shirley, for every 13 doors he knocks at, he arranges one
appointment. Allowing for half of all appointments falling through, one in
every 2.5 appointments leads to a sale - of average value about Pounds
2,500. Shirley is proud that his sales to appointments ratio is better than
the Everest average of one to three. More than two thirds of his business
comes from knocking on doors or following up other contacts, the rest mainly
from people responding to company advertisements.
Shirley can be persistent. His biggest success came a year ago when he
persuaded a well-heeled grandmother to buy Pounds 21,000 of double glazing.
To clinch the deal he stayed up all night, talking to her and her daughter
for 12 hours non-stop and got home at 6.30am.
'Taking someone from being a definite no to a definite yes can be
thrilling,' he says. 'You have to push yourself beyond your comfort levels.
At the same time you have to think positively and not be put off by
failure.'
There are things he will not do. Asked about the 'strong arm' sales tactics
which have given the double glazing industry a bad name, Shirley gives a
withering look. Everest's code of practice forbids such methods and they act
against his interests. 'I'm not going to sell anyone anything they don't
want. We want customers to recommend us to their friends: they're not going
to do this if they are unhappy.'
A big part of his job is linking up with the 10 people in his sales group.
He says his training as a tank gunner helps him appreciate team work.
Shirley sees one of his 'reps' every day, normally for lunch, and meets them
all every Monday in a Newark hotel. 'I recruit them, I'm a shoulder to cry
on, sometimes a marriage guidance counsellor,' he says.
To 'incentivise' his team, he digs into his own earnings for prizes such as
Pounds 300 worth of Marks and Spencer vouchers for the person with most
sales over a month. In 1993 he spent about Pounds 6,000 on promotional
schemes and incentives.
All this effort pays off. During 1993, in spite of the recession, Shirley's
team sold just over Pounds 1m worth of double glazing, a new record for the
Grantham area. His own share of the sales were about a quarter. This put
Grantham in eighth spot out of 110 in the Everest 'league table' of UK sales
regions.
The financial rewards have given Shirley and his family a comfortable
life-style: they live in a tastefully converted 18th century barn in the
countryside with views of Lincoln Cathedral. The house is double-glazed and
acts as a showroom as well as an office. His wife, Kim, does a lot of the
paperwork: sales figures have to be faxed to Everest's head office three
times a week.
He admits work has become an obsession, not just for the material rewards
but because of his need to compete and for the sense of recognition that
doing well for his company gives him. 'My home is my office, my home is
Everest, Everest is me,' he says. 'I'm proud of what I do. But I wouldn't
influence anyone to work as hard as me.'

FT  08 JAN 94 / Minding Your Own Business: Love affair with a mouse -
Computing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEAN MILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I have learned to love Windows. The Windows operating system must be one of
the most successful marketing devices in the history of commerce. It is an
'environment' to be loaded into memory after your computer has loaded DOS,
its own perfectly good operating system.
In order to run Windows successfully, you will need a new computer with a
fast processor and plenty of memory. If you don't have one, you might as
well get a colour monitor so that you can enjoy the tartan wallpaper desktop
design. You will certainly need a mouse to push around on your desk.
Thus equipped, you are ready to go out and buy Windows programs to do the
work you are doing already.
Why? Because Windows is fun, that's why. Pushing a mouse around, clicking
here and there, makes you feel powerful and authoritative. You have to take
one hand off the keyboard for mouse control purposes. You might as well take
the other hand off as well and relax into some really creative time-wasting.
Windows was supplied with the computer I bought in 1992, as it is with
almost all personal computers sold today. But I was slow in getting to grips
with it for two reasons, both of them illustrative of a quality in me which
my husband calls witlessness.
First of all, I tried to move around Windows from the keyboard, without
unpacking and plugging in my mouse. It can be done, but it is slow and
clumsy.
This is a factor to be considered if you are buying a portable computer:
they tend to come with a 'tracking device' as a mouse-substitute. Some
tracking devices are better than others.
I got my own mouse out at last when Quicken for Windows presented me with an
iconbar - a row of little pictures - which could only be reached by the
mouse.
Second, I stuck to Windows version 3.0 for far too long.
Eventually my computer spat out a program I had been given to evaluate, with
a message to the effect that my version of Windows really was not up to
scratch. I upgraded to Windows 3.1 that week, and haven't looked back since.
The new version actually has a shorter manual than its predecessor, because
it looks after a lot of the complicated things like memory management
without needing help from the user. It was easy to install. It replaced the
older version automatically, preserving all my Windows programs and their
arrangements. No longer are my Windows sessions abruptly and inexplicably
'terminated'.
My favourite Windows program is Lotus Organiser, a computerised personal
organiser with pages that seem to turn, coloured tabs to click on for the
different sections, and a year planner that appears to fold out just like a
paper one. This program is seriously useful simply because it is so much
fun: I keep coming back to it, and begin to find that things really are
getting organised.
If you keep a to-do list in Organiser it is worth actually getting around to
one or two of the items on it just for the joy of clicking in the
'Completed' box and seeing the chore dispatched to the end of the list with
a line through it.
You could, of course, keep a list of things to do on paper, and draw lines
through them as required. But Organiser has some electronic tricks that are
more difficult to duplicate.
Items can be linked to other items; tasks to do, for example, can be linked
to telephone numbers in the address section, to diary entries or to notes,
enabling you to fly from one to the other.
If you have a modem, Organiser will dial your telephone numbers for you. If
you send and receive electronic mail, Organiser will go look in your letter
box. If any of your to-do's involve another program, Organiser can be set to
start up your word processor or database for you.
For a complicated project such as a wedding or moving house, you could
usefully have a separate Organiser devoted entirely to the subject.
The only thing wrong with this program is a laughably inadequate manual.
Everything must be figured out from the help screens. Huge manuals can be
daunting, but this silly little pamphlet goes much too far in the other
direction. We deserve better from Lotus.
The other Windows program I have come to love this year is Microsoft's
Visual Basic. When I was learning my computer craft, programming was just
about the only thing you could do on a personal computer.
The IBM PC was yet to be invented, and even elementary word processing was
still in the future as far as a home user was concerned. Writing those
little programs was for me an experience of mental exhilaration to be
compared with my first sight of Raphael's portrait of Castiglione. Visual
Basic brings that excitement back within range for all.
While you're wandering around Windows, you might have a look at Solitaire,
the American name for the familiar red-nine-goes-on-the-black-10 game of
patience. It is brilliant. From the option list, choose 'Vegas rules'. Set
it to keep score. Choose yourself an attractive deck of cards from the dozen
on offer.
You will never do any work again.
All of the programs mentioned are widely available from computer dealers and
shops. It is worth looking around for the best prices. Windows 3.1 costs
about Pounds 55, Organiser about Pounds 90, Visual Basic v3 for Windows
about Pounds 80, plus VAT in each case.

FT  08 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: Cover against the law - The benefits
of insuring against litigation costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATRIN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Few companies ever want to call in the lawyers unless there is no
alternative; indeed, an unwanted suit can be especially damaging for smaller
businesses struggling to stay afloat.
But with solicitors charging up to Pounds 300 an hour, and fees for
barristers running into thousands of pounds, legal expenses insurance -
where a company will cover itself against the financial losses litigation
might entail - begins to look ever more attractive.
Although this type of insurance is often associated with motor and household
policies, where it can be tacked on as an added extra, one of the biggest
growth areas has been in policies tailor-made for companies. These now
account for about Pounds 25m of the total Pounds 75m market in the UK for
legal expenses insurance.
'Last year was a boom year for legal expenses insurance,' says Paul Asplin,
assistant general manager of Bristol-based DAS, a leading specialist insurer
which recorded a 28 per cent growth in premium income last year.
In spite of this growth, the choice of insurers from which to pick a policy
is not vast - unlike the Continent, where legal expenses insurance is a
long-established market.
There are two leading players in the UK which provide general cover for
companies. One is DAS, a subsidiary of the Dusseldorf- based Victoria Group
which is a major German composite insurer. The other is the Legal Protection
Group Ltd (LPG), a subsidiary of Sun Alliance, which operates from Sutton,
in Surrey.
The lowest premiums available are about Pounds 100 for the most basic cover,
but more standard is a package that costs about Pounds 500. As Douglas
Macdonald, sales and marketing manager of LPG, points out: 'If an hour's
worth of a lawyer is Pounds 250 now, then a company can get that for a
year's premium.'
The standard package usually has two elements; advice (in the form of a
legal helpline) and insurance. The helpline is intended to act as a 'smoke
detector' and is likely to provide smaller businesses with many of the
benefits of an in-house lawyer.
Employers are encouraged to use the telephone as much as possible to nip
potential problems in the bud. LPG's 24-hour advice line has 19 full-time
advisers, while DAS gets 100,000 calls a year on its service. Many are
related to employment problems and the correct procedures that should be
followed. 'Typically, it's a boss with a small business worried about
getting rid of someone,' says Macdonald.
In fact, most legal expenses policies oblige you to consult the helpline
before taking action which could lead to dismissing anyone. (If you do not,
you will not be covered).
The insurance packages themselves are flexible enough; most policies enable
you to mix and match. They should include general cover for such risks as
fees, expenses, witnesses' attendance at court hearings, and costs awarded
against you.
Typically, these risks take in contract disputes (where you can sue if a
supplier fails to meet required specifications); the costs of defence
(should mistakes lead to criminal prosecutions being brought); property
problems (relevant to those leasing or sub-letting); tax proceedings and VAT
disputes. Some, but not all, policies provide further cover for race and sex
discrimination proceedings, or breaches under the Data Protection Act. This
can add another Pounds 50 or Pounds 60 to the premium.
So, how much does this cover you for? Indemnity limits tend to be flexible,
set typically at Pounds 50,000, Pounds 100,000 or Pounds 250,000 a claim.
Although the insurers may advise you to go for the upper limit, it is
probably best not to take caution too far; the standard limit for which
policyholders opt is Pounds 100,000.
If, however, you are the awkward litigant, you should not necessarily regard
legal expenses insurance as a blank cheque. The excesses on the contract
disputes cover can vary from Pounds 500 on DAS, while the LPG's minimum
excess on contract cover is Pounds 1,000. This will not cover the niggling
disputes that bedevil so many smaller businesses.
Nor will any crusading zeal on your part convince the insurance company to
cover you in a claim it regards as hopeless. There is a small but
significant clause which states that you must have a 'reasonable prospect of
success'.
'If it's better than a 50-50 chance, we're quite happy with that,' says
Macdonald. But it should be remembered that the insurer decides what
constitutes a 'reasonable' prospect, although certain arbitration procedures
are built in. 'If we can't see eye to eye, we get an independent lawyer to
give a report,' says Asplin.
Even if you never see the inside of a courtroom, Pounds 500 is probably
worth a bit of peace of mind for many smaller businesses. After all, the
helpline alone is cheaper than your own in-house lawyer.

FT  08 JAN 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Mortgage relief
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Where tax relief on mortgage interest is given under Miras, can the gross
interest be deducted from income for the purpose of establishing whether any
higher rate tax is payable? I am, of course, aware that relief from
higher-rate tax is not given on the mortgage interest.
No, your higher-rate liability for 1993-94 will be calculated as though you
had no mortgage.
Section 369 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988, as amended, says:
'(3A) In computing for the purposes of excess liability the total income of
a person for any year of assessment, no deduction shall be allowed in
respect of any amount of relevant loan interest to which this section
applies.
'(3B) In this section, 'excess liability' means the excess of liability to
income tax over what it would be if all income tax not chargeable at the
lower rate by virtue of section 1(2)(aa) were charged at the basic rate, or
(so far as applicable in accordance with section 207A) the lower rate, to
the exclusion of any higher rate.

<TEXT>
My wife and I own jointly a house and three acres of land, purchased in
1985, which is a registered agricultural holding and on which I have
sometimes kept livestock. The Revenue has records of this, albeit the
venture ran at a loss and was not my primary occupation.
The land has been allocated recently in the unitary development plan for
residential development and I would wish to mitigate any liability towards
capital gains tax.
1. Would roll-over relief be available into other agricultural premises?
2. When does the land assume an enhanced value: (a) when allocated; (b) when
the UDP is adopted formally? or (c) once planning permission is obtained
formally?
I am told the land will be adopted formally in around six months. Would
there be any benefit in any form of disposal at present - perhaps to buy a
pension for ourselves or to benefit our children?
1. The answer appears to be no, from the bare facts given. If the accountant
who prepared your farming accounts cannot help you on the tax aspects, you
could ask your solicitor (whose services you will need in any event, it
seems, when a sale is in prospect).
2. At every stage, there is an increase in hope value, generally speaking.
Financial planning really needs a face-to-face discussion with your
solicitor or another professional adviser. There is no useful comment that
we can offer without knowing far more background facts and figures than
could be supplied by post.

<TEXT>
London-based private bank Leopold Joseph is launching an index-matching
investment service for private clients and small institutions. The aim is to
answer to what it claims is general underperformance against the stock
market indices by private client portfolio managers.
Its Optimised Investment Service will invest in index-tracking unit trusts,
covering UK and overseas markets, rather than individual shares. Portfolios
also will include deposits and bonds on an individually-tailored basis. The
minimum portfolio is Pounds 250,000.
The service adopts a largely 'buy and hold' strategy in order to minimise
the expenses of transactions. The annual management fee starts at 0.75 per
cent up to the first Pounds 1m, with a Pounds 2,500 minimum.
Waters Lunniss, the stockbroking arm of the Norwich and Peterborough
building society, has reduced charges on its Brokerline execution-only
telephone dealing service. Commission on deals worth up to Pounds 5,000 is 1
per cent (Pounds 17 minimum) and 0.1 per cent on the balance over Pounds
5,000. Previous charges had been 1.2 per cent on the first Pounds 2,500, 1
per cent on the next Pounds 2,500, and 0.1 per cent on the balance over
Pounds 5,000. A customer will save Pounds 5 on a deal worth Pounds 2,500.
Friends Provident is extending its personal equity plan from the Stewardship
unit trust to all its qualifying unit trusts: Equity, European Growth and
Stewardship income trust. The initial charge is 5 per cent while the annual
fee is 1 1/8 per cent for the Stewardship funds and 1 per cent for the
others. Minimum investment is a Pounds 1,000 lump sum or monthly
contributions of Pounds 40.

FT  08 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: Keep your eye on small companies -
Diary of a Private Investor
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Now that professional pundits, City gurus, newspaper columnists, astrologers
and others have revealed their thoughts and forecasts for 1994, I feel much
happier. Between them, there are enough variations to ensure that at least
one will be as wrong as I was last year.
Making my 1993 predictions in December 1992, I was right in believing that
interest rates would fall; some insurance companies would slash their bonus
rates; the Conservatives would incur losses in the county elections;
unemployment would remain high; and that while the government would show the
economy was improving, 'troubles' would break out in unexpected places
overseas. I also hoped Taurus, the London stock market's electronic share
settlement system, would be aborted - and it was.
But I was completely wrong in adopting a cautious stance towards the stock
market. Although I expected people to seek havens for their money other than
low-yielding bank and building society accounts, I failed to foresee the
heights to which markets around the world (including the UK) would be pushed
by the weight of money seeking large returns.
My stupidest comment of all was: 'There will be many pitfalls for private
investors in 1993 - including avoiding the shares of those ITV companies
which have bid too high for their franchises and will have start paying for
those bids.' Yorkshire TV was 110p in January 1993 - but had risen to 156p
by the end of the year, largely because of investors anticipating a shake-up
in the television industry.
I also said that making significant profits would 'depend largely on
monitoring shares in small companies carefully, and taking advantage of any
further major upheavals in currencies.' While some small companies achieved
spectacular returns in 1993, many major companies, which I had thought to be
at optimum levels in 1992, still powered ahead to produce very attractive
gains.
In an early draft of that article, I had included the comment: 'Backing
shrewd individuals, like Peter Buckley of Caledonia Investments, could also
prove profitable in 1993.' Unfortunately, I revised the article to exclude
that (and other) comments and did not even take my own advice.
Caledonia Investments, 448p in January 1993, had risen to 624p by the end of
the year. Buckley is also on the boards of Amber Industrial (which rose from
345p to 725p), English and Scottish Investors (up from 88p to 124p),
Sterling Industries (126p to 200p) and the Telegraph publishing group (345p
to 495p).
With such personal fallibility in mind, my expectations for 1994 undoubtedly
will undergo much revision as the year progresses. At the moment, though, I
believe there are still likely to be some bargains among small companies.
Many years ago, when first I took an interest in this sector, there were no
hordes of unit trusts specialising in small companies. I could invest
knowing that my fellow investors were, largely, other private investors
(including board members of the companies concerned) and perhaps one or two
pension funds (such as the Mars confectionery firm). Many of the
shareholders were prepared to be patient and hold for the long term. But
increased unit trust interest has changed my perception of many small
companies.
Unit trusts are driven by what their investors want. If they decide suddenly
that trusts specialising in, say, emerging markets are more interesting than
small UK companies, then they will switch to these. The only way trust
managers can repay those switching investors (apart from attracting new ones
to replace them) is to sell some of the trusts' small company holdings.
Share dealings in a number of small companies are not exactly easy at the
best of times: share liquidity can be difficult, as some of them are not
traded actively. If a unit trust has to sell a holding of 1 or 2 per cent
(or more) of a small company, this could have a disproportionate effect on
its share price, as the shares might have to be marked down substantially
before buyers could be found for most of them. I intend to watch for any
such sharp mark-downs; they could reveal excellent buying opportunities.
In 1993, some of the emerging markets' unit trusts achieved massive gains,
and I expect many more people to be attracted towards such trusts early this
year as those gains become known more widely. In some of those countries,
however, 'share ramping' is not uncommon.
Several people combine to push up a share price in the expectation that
others, believing the company has excellent prospects, will invest and drive
the price still higher. The original group then sells its shares at a fat
profit before serious doubts can be raised about the relative worth of the
company and its price falls back.
Although there has been much recent comment about the UK emerging from
recession and January sales setting records at certain shops, I am not
rushing to buy shares in the store sector. Sales may well be up - but what
about profit margins?
The recession has made many more people seek value for money. It has also
led a number to discover a social conscience. In the main, conspicuous
consumption is no longer fashionable, apart from some of the newly-rich in
Hong Kong. Even there, as 1997 approaches, more people may start to think
about the parallels with Shanghai in the 1920s and some of the events that
followed.
I shall, therefore, seek out those companies world-wide which provide goods
and services that are seen to offer value for money, as their shares ought
to perform better than others.
I will also be searching for companies that provide something new and
exciting. What will be the latest technological innovation - the useful
something that people feel they must have?
This year could be full of surprises. I hope I will be daring enough to
profit from them.

FT  08 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: Beating pension costs
</HEADLINE>

The shortcomings of personal pensions have been reported widely, especially
the high commission charges which lead to lower transfer values or future
pay-outs. For equity-based schemes, fund management charges also can be
substantial.
When I left a public sector scheme in December 1985, I took a lump sum
transfer into a unit-linked personal pension. The transfer took effect in
mid-1989; soon afterwards, the insurance company involved increased its
management fees. It claimed it needed to cover extra costs imposed by the
Financial Services Act of 1986, which was implemented in 1988.
The annual charge went up from 0.5 to 0.75 per cent on the company's
building society deposit fund, while the increase for other funds was from
0.75 to 1 per cent. Thus, a pension valued at Pounds 100,000 incurred fund
management charges of up to Pounds 1,000 a year. I decided this could be
avoided by investing directly in deposit accounts and in investment trusts
which had lower management costs.
After investigating several options, I transferred the personal pension into
a small self-administered scheme (SSAS) in December 1992. The costs (for the
insurance company's administrative fees and auditing) were lower than the
fund management charges for the personal pension.
Since I had a considerable time to retirement, I hoped the performance of
the SSAS would match that of fund managers, who are constrained by monthly
comparisons.
As a professional economist, I reasoned that my strengths lay in assessing
economic trends and sectoral prospects but that others might be better at
selecting companies. So, I decided investment trusts could be used to
complement my skills.
Acting as my own investment manager, I use Fidelity Brokerage on an
execution-only basis. I monitor the portfolio weekly, using Fairshares
software, and prepare the accounts on Sage Accountant. These tasks can be
fitted in with other activities, but a SASS would be less attractive if it
had to be charged at market rates.
Late in 1992, the property sector was identified by investment managers as
due for a substantial re-rating so I bought Artesian Commercial, an unquoted
company; TR's Property Investment trust; and Mucklow Group, the property
investor and developer.
Since a marked reduction in medium-term interest rates also was expected,
this increased the attraction of the income shares of split capital
investment trusts. These provide a geared return under such circumstances
and, as a bonus, they offer excellent yields.
Most of the SSAS equity fund was invested during the early months of 1993
and, since it has now been operating for a full year, its initial
performance can be assessed. The property recovery and reduction in interest
rates have been more rapid than expected: the portfolio valuation is 59 per
cent above its starting value a year ago. This compares with a 23 per cent
increase in the FT-A index and poorer performance in my executive
unit-linked pension schemes.
The equity fund consists of 14 companies plus a money market bank account.
Individual returns range from an increase of 197 per cent in Sphere IT
Income shares to a likely loss of 100 per cent in Queens Moat 7.5 per cent
Convertible Preference shares (see chart).
Pentos has proved a big disappointment, but good profits were made during
the year on Japanese and emerging market investment trusts warrants. Only 4
per cent of the fund was in cash at the year-end.
Was the 59 per cent return beginner's luck? I think not, since the changes
were foreseen but happened more rapidly than expected. In the coming year, I
plan to consolidate my gains as interest rates bottom out. Most of the
investment trust income shares are still giving very good yields, but the
portfolio is vulnerable to a rise in inflation and higher interest rates.
I will also continue to look for sectors with recovery potential - property
development, construction and oil exploration are possibilities.

In spectacular market conditions, it is hardly surprising to see the volume
of selling rise sharply - not just the number of trades but also the cash
value of those sales.
Dr Desmond Graves, director of construction company George Wimpey, appears
again with two separate sales, each of 300,000 shares. Graves sold two
tranches of stock totalling Pounds 750,000 at the beginning of the month, so
the latest reduction takes his sales to 1.35m shares. Since he now holds
just 270,000, clearly that is a very significant divestment. Wimpey has been
one of the weaker performers in the construction sector but is back in the
black after last year's loss.
Another stock in the same sector, Persimmon, was also affected by some
selling. Michael Allen, the deputy chairman, disposed of 71,621 shares at
305p, reducing his holding to just over 200,000.
In contrast to Wimpey, Persimmon shares performed well last year and have
risen by almost 40 per cent against the market over the past 12 months.
A good deal of the selling has been option-related. A number of deals stand
out, not least Standard Chartered where recovery has been particularly
strong. David Moir, director of banking for the Asia Pacific region,
exercised an option over 93,000 shares, selling them all at Pounds 12.18.
Since mid-November, four directors have exercised options over large
tranches of stock and sold the resulting holdings.
Two directors in Grand Metropolitan, including Sir Allen Sheppard, the
chairman and chief executive, also exercised large options in Grand
Metropolitan and sold the lot.

FT  08 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: East gives west a boost - Hong
Kong's growth has stimulated fund performance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Do not be disappointed if your unit or investment trust is not included in
the four tables (below) of the top collective funds over three and 10 years.
Figures released this week by Micropal show that those heading the list are
most likely to be highly specialist funds.
Take the unit trust tables; eight of the 10 funds listed over the two
periods are in the Far East (excluding Japan) sector. Much of the growth has
come from a sharp increase in Hong Kong; last year alone, the Hang Seng
index rose by 115 per cent. Hong Kong is seen by many fund managers as the
most exciting growth 'opportunity' of the future because of the capitalist
transformation of the Chinese economy.
It is, therefore, no surprise that the fund which has dominated the Far East
(excluding Japan) sector is one invested mainly there. Gartmore Hong Kong
heads both unit trust tables and was also the top-performing unit trust over
five years (all figures to the beginning of January; offer to bid with net
income re-invested).
There are, however, unlikely to be many private investors brave enough to
have chosen Hong Kong as their main investment home. While being open to
pent-up demand and economic reform in China, the colony's stock market is
also vulnerable to internal Chinese politics and to Beijing's volatile
relations with the west.
Still, anyone who had the foresight 10 years ago to invest, say, Pounds
5,000 in Gartmore's Hong Kong fund would have turned this into almost Pounds
59,000 today.
The two other top-performing unit trusts listed in the tables are both in
the European sector. Baring European Growth has a strong long-term
performance record and was managed for many years by the widely-respected
Crispin Odey, who left in 1991. The fund has increased since then from about
Pounds 260m to Pounds 480m, and is managed now by Omid Kamshad.
St James's Place is a three-man investment team which, apart from managing a
range of unit trusts, also runs pension and life funds for J. Rothschild
Assurance, the company established by Sir Mark Weinberg and Lord Rothschild.
The strongest performers among the investment trusts are from a wider
variety of sectors but, once again, the specialists are not confined to the
short-term performance tables. The investment trust figures are calculated
on a mid-market to mid-market basis, with net income re-invested.
The top fund over 10 years - Capital Gearing - invests in the shares of
other investment trusts and is a small fund with only Pounds 10m of assets.
The second-best performer over the same period was the capital shares of the
split-capital M&amp;G Second Dual trust, which is due to be wound up in 1995.
Capital shares are highly-geared and are regarded traditionally as risky
investments, since they have no claim to the income of the trust but rely on
performance to reap the remaining assets on wind-up.
The table does, however, include the more mainstream TR City of London and
Law Debenture, both managed by Henderson Touche Remnant. Law Debenture is
invested in a broad international spread of investments and is managed by
Michael Moule, who was also TR City of London's fund manager until 1991. TR
City invests mainly in blue chip UK stocks with the aim of producing a
higher than average yield.
The three-year investment trust performance figures are, once again, led by
an oddity. The ordinary shares of the split-level TR Technology fund are
highly-geared. John Korwin-Szymanowski, investment trust analyst at SG
Warburg, says this gearing has been created by the presence of zero dividend
and stepped preference shares. The trust invests in high technology
companies, mostly in the UK and US.
Murray Enterprise is a split-capital trust with an investment strategy of
capital growth through investment mainly in unlisted securities. The other
funds in the three-year investment trust table are in the Far East
(excluding Japan) sector.
Scottish Asian was launched in 1990 by Murray Johnstone. Korwin-Szymanowski
says it is differentiated from most Far East funds by the investment
policies of Peter Montgomery, its manager. He has a reputation for
preferring large weightings in markets he believes will perform well rather
than a diluted portfolio.
Although most of the top-performing collective funds are specialists, it is
reassuring to see the presence of well-established names. Murray Johnstone
and Henderson Touche take the lion's share as managers of the top investment
trusts, while the glory is spread more broadly among the unit trusts.
Capel-Cure Asset Management, which featured prominently in the same exercise
in the previous two years, is conspicuous by its absence this time round.
Funds which topped the tables this year will not necessarily do so in
future. As recent articles by John Cuthbert in the Weekend FT have shown,
investors need to examine the trade-off between the risks taken by managers
and the returns they achieve.

The table below shows unit trusts investing in predominantly UK
fixed-interest securities. Such funds can choose from a fairly wide range of
securities, including government securities (gilts), corporate bonds,
convertibles and preference shares.
Gilts have performed extremely well recently as interest rates have dropped
 -yet Abtrust Fixed Interest, the best-performing fund in the table, holds
none. Its portfolio is mainly convertible stocks (about two-thirds), with
the rest in preference shares and higher-yielding Eurobonds.
Paul Reed, manager of the fund, says: 'We went for convertible stocks where
we could get an equity kicker for virtually nothing. The stocks would yield
more than gilts and there would be an equity option in there, too.'
Convertibles are corporate bonds combined with an option to be switched into
equities under certain circumstances. When equity markets are doing well,
this can add considerably to the performance of convertibles. But as soon as
Reed starts to worry about prospects for the equity market, he will reduce
his holding of them.
The higher yields available from corporate bonds make them attractive to
fund managers despite their being regarded as more risky than gilts, the
reasoning being that a company is more likely to go bust than the
government. 'If I can get a spread of 1.5 to 2 per cent over gilts in
something else, and I like the credit, I will hold that rather than gilts,'
says Reed.
The BG Bond fund, second in the table, is about 61 per cent invested in
gilts, with the rest in corporate bonds. When it was launched in April 1992,
the fund held some overseas bonds, but those holdings have been sold and it
is now invested wholly in the UK.
Mark Campbell, of Baillie Gifford, which manages BG Bond, says: 'It is by no
means a straight gilt fund. It will always tend to have a weighting in
gilts, but we are quite happy to use other corporate and local authority
bonds to give it that slight edge.'
After such a good year for gilts, are they due for a fall? 'Returns will be
more modest in 1994 but there is scope for further gains,' predicts
Campbell.
Abtrust charges 5.25 per cent initially and 1 per cent annually, with a
minimum investment of Pounds 500. BG Bond charges 5 per cent initially, 0.4
per cent annually, and is aimed at larger investors with a minimum of Pounds
5,000.

FT  08 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: How to beat the fuel tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With less than three months before value added tax is imposed on fuel,
electricity companies appear to have realised the cash-flow benefits of
letting customers pay in advance, so avoiding VAT.
Several regional companies are sending out information on the tax dodge with
their quarterly accounts, and some have printed forms for customers who want
to pay a lump sum in March to cover bills a year or two ahead. British Gas
is not encouraging pre-payment but will accept it.
VAT will be charged at 8 per cent on domestic fuel bills - now zero rated -
from April 1 and 17.5 per cent from the same date next year. But advance
payments avoid the tax.
The savings from paying in advance outweigh the interest lost by taking your
money out of the building society at present interest rates.
Maurice Fitzpatrick, a VAT specialist at accountant Chantrey Vellacott,
estimates the return on paying in advance for two year's worth of fuel at
about 10 per cent, compared with perhaps 3 per cent net from an average
building society account. Higher-rate taxpayers could do even better than
those on the basic rate, as their net returns from money on deposit are even
lower.
It is probably worth paying in advance if:
You have money sitting on deposit at standard interest rates which you are
not likely to need for anything else.
You do not intend to move house in the near future.
You use mainly gas and/or electricity.
If your electricity company has not made special arrangements, you will need
to attach an explanatory letter to the cheque for your over-payment, to make
sure it is dealt with as you intend.
If you are not intending to pay in advance, but receive an estimated gas or
electricity bill this quarter which is lower than your actual meter reading,
make a point of sending back the reply card and asking for your bill to be
adjusted. This way, you do not end up paying VAT on fuel actually consumed
before April.
The benefits to users of solid fuels are rather less clear-cut than for
those of gas and electricity. Paying for two year's worth of heating oil
before April would indeed avoid VAT - but few households have oil tanks
large enough to cope with two year's supply. So, they would be paying for
goods not yet delivered.
If you paid for a large amount in advance, but had taken delivery of perhaps
only a third when the supply company collapsed, you would be left as an
unsecured creditor, with little chance of recovering much of your money.
Large privatised utilities stand less chance of going bust in the space of
two years than small suppliers.
'It is all very well putting a deposit with a blue chip plc, but perhaps not
so good putting a deposit with a local fuel oil company,' says Fitzpatrick.
'I think one would have to exercise considerable caution.'
There is, however, every reason to refill your oil tank by the end of March
rather than waiting for the autumn as you might do normally.

FT  08 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: The Week Ahead
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
On Monday when Tomkins reports interim results the market will be looking
for reassurance about trading conditions for Ranks Hovis McDougall which the
conglomerate acquired a year ago. Analysts are expecting pre-tax profits of
about Pounds 87m (Pounds 47.1m) for the six months to end-October giving a
dividend of about 1.95p (1.805p) on fully-diluted earnings of 5.1p (4.87p),
not adjusted for share issues to finance the RHM acquisition.
The City will be particularly keen to hear the year-end results on Wednesday
of First Leisure, the discos, bingo and bowling group. Its shares fell from
378p in March to 234p in November on fears of weak leisure spending by the
public. The shares have recovered to 285p but the City is still looking for
reassurance.
Analysts forecast pre-tax profits of about Pounds 32m (Pounds 31.1m) for the
year to October and a final dividend of 4.7p (4.26p).
Rank Organisation reports preliminary results on Thursday amid speculation
about the scale of the likely dent in the figures caused by the decision of
its joint venture partner Xerox to cut its global workforce. Analysts are
looking for pre-tax profits around Pounds 264m (Pounds 230.1m).
However, full-year results from TSB Group are likely to cheer the market.
Figures are expected to recover on lower bad debt provisions. Analysts are
forecasting pre-tax profits of Pounds 260m-Pounds 280m for the year to
October 31 compared with Pounds 6m, re-stated from Pounds 43m to comply with
new accounting rules.

FT  08 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: Slump in bonus payouts shows signs
of easing - The outlook for with-profits endowments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Anyone hoping to pay off a mortgage with an endowment policy in 1994 will be
watching closely the life insurance companies' announcements of this year's
bonus rates.
Bonuses on with-profits endowments have been cut quite savagely in the past
few years as insurance companies realised they could no longer afford to tap
into their reserves to pay for past miscalculations. This year, the cuts are
more modest and there are actually some increases.
The picture emerging from the handful of companies which announced their
bonus rates this week (more are due within the next few weeks) is that
anyone with a 10-year endowment maturing this year is looking at a lower
payout than in previous years, while some holders of 25-year policies will
face only marginal cuts or possible slight increases.
Actual bonus rates have been held to the same level as last year in some
cases, but the final payouts are lower because policies maturing this year
have accumulated fewer of the high bonuses of the 1980s.
The final payout on a with-profits endowment policy is made up of the sum
assured and all bonuses. Reversionary bonuses, added annually, cannot be
taken away once they have been given. Sometimes, reversionary bonuses are
calculated in two parts: an ordinary bonus, which is a percentage of the sum
assured; and a bonus on previous bonuses, so that growth is compounded.
These build up over the life of a policy.
Finally, a terminal bonus is added to the policy when it matures, to pass on
a share of any investment returns not already allocated with annual bonuses.
Terminal bonuses can be more than 100 per cent of the sum assured.
With-profits endowment policies are, however, designed to smooth out
investment returns over time. In a year when shares do well (most life funds
are invested mainly in equities, along with some property and fixed interest
securities), bonuses will usually be less than the stock market growth rate
so that, in years when stocks do not do so well, a similar bonus can still
be paid.
Actuaries have to guess what average investment returns will be over the
life of the policy. If they get it wrong, and pay far too much for several
years when actual returns are low, they will eventually have to compensate
by paying too little when investment returns are better. This is what has
been happening recently.
In 1990, bonuses were raised when they should have been cut. Bonus cuts and
slightly better investment returns in subsequent years may not yet have
quite compensated for the dent that made in reserves.
Cuts have slowed this year but the picture is not entirely rosy: most
insurance companies say bonuses are likely to fall further in future, as
high rates can no longer be justified in times of low inflation and expected
lower investment returns. Larger cuts were prevented this year only because
of spectacular stock market performance towards the end of 1993.
Bonuses on unitised with-profit endowments have also been cut by most
companies this year, but they depend less on the discretion of the actuaries
and more on the actual performance of the investment fund.
Some insurers have to be particularly cautious with 10-year payouts this
year because there are larger than usual volumes of 10-year policies
maturing. Life assurance premium relief was abolished in 1984 and many
people rushed to buy policies before the deadline. Miscalculations this year
could cost insurers more than normal.
Although returns from endowments are falling, insurance companies are keen
to stress that, for a relatively low-risk investment, they still provide a
respectable return above inflation, which has also been falling.
For example, a Norwich Union with-profits endowment taken out 25 years ago
by a 29-year-old man paying Pounds 30 a month would now be worth Pounds
58,694, representing an annual yield of 12.9 per cent. A 10-year policy on
the same basis is now worth Pounds 6,674, a yield of 11.9 per cent.
In comparison, Pounds 30 a month paid into a unit trust savings plan for the
median UK equity income fund, starting 10 years ago, would now be worth
Pounds 7,048, and Pounds 101,228 after 25 years (according to the
Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds, and Micropal). If the money
had been invested via a personal equity plan, those figures would be Pounds
7,724 and Pounds 146,993.
Of course, unit trusts do not provide any life insurance cover but many
endowments, particularly 10-year policies, are taken out purely as
investments with the life insurance element being a side issue.
Worries in recent times that some low-cost endowments would fail to pay off
the mortgages they were intended to cover appear to have faded somewhat for
policies maturing in this and the next few years. But if investment returns
are low throughout the 1990s, that might present a potential problem to
holders of policies from the late 1980s.

FT  08 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: Why the FT is making changes . . .
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN, Financial Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Saturday readers turning to today's share price listings will find a curious
mixture of the strange and the familiar. The grey-on-pink columns look, at a
glance, just as they always do - or, at least, as they have done since the
typography was changed a year or so ago. All the securities listed are
exactly the same as before, and many of the sectors into which they are
divided are also identical. Some sectors have split or merged, however, some
shares have moved sectors, and the names of several sectors have been
altered subtly.
Overall, it could take some time to adjust to the changes. To make the
process easier, this issue also contains a two-page alphabetical listing of
every security carried in the London Share Service, together with the name
of the sector in which it now appears.
The FT has organised share prices by industry for years. Investors like to
be able to make a quick estimate of how a share is doing in comparison with
its industry rivals; putting them alongside each other in manageable sectors
allows the price/earnings ratio or day's price change of, say, Glaxo to be
compared easily with that of SmithKline Beecham.
None the less, arranging shares by sector does make it harder to look up a
share for the first time. You must first make a guess at the heading under
which it is likely to be found, then locate that on the page. In the worst
cases, it could be necessary to scan several sectors before finding the
right one.
This problem can be lessened by using accurate and carefully drawn sectors.
For this reason, the FT changed a year or so ago from its traditional
sectors (memorable for the number of stocks described as Industrials,
Miscellaneous) to the classification used for the FT-SE Actuaries All-Share
index.
That classification has now been through its first thorough overhaul in two
decades to yield sectors that reflect more accurately the shape of today's
market. Electricals and Electronics have been merged. Oil and Gas has been
sub-divided, as has Health and Household. And each of the traditionally
large grab-bag of Miscellaneous stocks has been given a proper home of its
own.
The normal daily table reporting the All-Share also changes, of course, to
show the new sectors. In the two-page alphabetical listing, those stocks
that are constituents of the All-Share after the normal end-year changes are
marked with an asterisk.
There is one other change to the London Share Service worth noting. Foreign
stocks which are not part of the main classification - those categorised as
Americans, Canadians, etc - have moved from the beginning of the pages to
the end. The first sector listed is now Banks.
We regret any inconvenience caused to readers by the change of sectors, and
hope it will be short-lived as the new structure becomes familiar. Users of
the FT's financial statistics have had to cope with a number of changes in
recent years. Although we believe the service to readers is improved, we are
conscious that disruption to long-established habits brings its own costs.
After these changes, we hope for a period of greater stability.
Fuller details of the changes to the All-Share classification appeared in
Tuesday's and Wednesday's editions of the FT.

FT  08 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: How money was made - Scheherazade
Daneshkhu traces a five-year record of investment highs and lows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU

<TEXT>
Investment is a gamble, and people deciding where to place their bets in
1994 may be tempted to look back five years to see if the roulette ball has
fallen on their chosen numbers during that period.
The chart shows the performance of various investments in the five years to
the beginning of this month, and is a yardstick against which the
performance of an investor's portfolio can be measured; indeed, it could
tell you where you should have invested five years ago.
The good news is that unless investors were heavily into the Japanese stock
market, which recorded a sharp downturn in 1990, or relied on property, they
will comfortably have beaten inflation to enjoy a real return.
It has not been the best five-year period for the more cautious, though.
Investors in building societies and National Savings did not fare as well as
those in equity-linked funds, although returns for those averse to risks
still have been reasonable.
Take an investor in the fourth issue of National Savings index-linked
certificates, providing a tax-free annual return of 4.04 per cent on top of
the rate of inflation. They will have seen a rise of 56.56 per cent on their
money with virtually no risk.
The Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester compounded returns shown in the chart are net of
basic-rate tax. They are lower than for the previous five-year period
(January 1988-January 1993) because interest rates in the past year have
been historically low at 5.5 to 6 per cent.
The stock market crash of 1987 was still at the back of investors' minds at
the beginning of 1989, but foreign buying late in 1988 helped to push up the
market.
The FT-SE 100 rose buoyantly from 1,793.1 at the end of December 1988 to
2,051.8 at the end of January 1989, and continued to rise on the back of
busy corporate activity throughout the spring and summer.
The stock market indices are included as a guide - they reflect capital
gains only and do not take re-invested income into account.
This means that although the average investment and unit trust (offer to
bid, net income re-invested) has fared well, the returns are not strictly
comparable with the market indices.
Investment trusts have shown strong returns over the period, helped by a
substantial narrowing of the discount from an average of 21 per cent at the
beginning of 1989 to 5 per cent at the start of this year.
Discounts have narrowed because of rising markets and strong demand from
private individuals who have been attracted into the sector by personal
equity plans and savings schemes.
The narrowing of discounts cannot be repeated on the same scale over the
next five years and could indeed widen, since some investment trusts today
stand at a premium to net asset value.
Returns in the future will instead depend on strong investment performance.
The average figure quoted is a very rough guide to the sector; individual
trusts show wide discrepancies in performance over the past five years.
An investor in the highest-performing investment trust over five years (EFM
Dragon, which invests in the Far East, excluding Japan) would have enjoyed a
return of 427 per cent while an investor in the worst trust (Gresham House)
would have shown a loss of 95 per cent, according to Micropal.
Although investors in unit trusts appear to have done less well than those
opting for an investment trust, the returns for investment trusts are shown
on a mid-market to mid-market basis (with net income re-invested) and do not
reflect the full bid-offer spread or brokers' commission.
The unit trust figures (offer-to-bid with net income re-invested) take all
charges into account.
Despite the recent rally in gilts, investors in UK bond funds and
international fixed-interest instruments fared less well than the average
unit trust.
The average gain for someone holding a UK bond fund was 57.5 per cent
(compared with 84.76 per cent for the average unit trust), while investors
in the average international fixed-interest unit trust achieved returns of
63.6 per cent. The devaluation of sterling has contributed to the
performance of this sector.
The UK indices show that there were good gains to be had over the period.
But investors would have fared even better in the US, where they would have
more than doubled their money. Once again, the performance of the US market
is helped by the decline of sterling; the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose
by just over 73 per cent in dollar terms, but this mushrooms into a rise of
111.67 per cent in sterling.
The benign tax regime of investments such as friendly society bonds and
managed pension funds contributed to their performance, as reflected in the
average figures in the chart. Both investments are relatively inflexible,
though; benefits from contributions into a pension fund can be drawn only on
retirement age.
If you surrendered your friendly society policy early, you are likely to
have got back only your premiums. Tax-efficient contributions into both a
friendly society policy and a pension fund are limited - in the case of a
friendly society the maximum monthly contribution in 1989 was Pounds 9.
That was the year in which the property market began to falter. The Halifax
house price index, which began in 1983, reached a peak of 228.5 in July 1989
 -an 18 per cent rise on the previous 12 months. To cool the overheated
economy and curb inflation, base rates went up to 15 per cent in October
1989.
Anyone who bought property at the beginning of 1989, for fear that they
might not be able to afford a purchase later, will have made a loss, on
average, of almost 7 per cent.
Unfortunately, past performance is not necessarily a guide to the future and
investors, particularly those who do not intend to take a long-term view,
will remain at the mercy of the investment roulette wheel.

FT  08 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: Pep charges cut or waived - At a
glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Fund managers are aiming to attract new investors looking for tax shelters
before the end of the tax year by cutting or waiving charges on Peps.
Clerical Medical is cutting the initial charge on its unit trust Peps from
5.25 per cent to 2.5 per cent for lump sum investments of more than Pounds
1,000 made between January 10 and April 5. There are five unit trusts to
choose from. Annual charges are 1.25 per cent on two of them, and 1.5 per
cent on the others.
Finsbury Asset Management is waiving all charges on its Peps until further
notice, and new Peps will be charge-free for their lifetime. Investors can
choose from four Finsbury investment trusts.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Edinburgh Fund Managers is launching a new investment trust to specialise in
smaller companies in emerging Asian markets. The New Tiger trust will invest
in companies with a market capitalisation of less than Dollars 500m, mainly
in Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, India, South Korea, China, the
Philippines, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.
The fund aims to raise Pounds 50m through a placing and offer for
subscription of shares at 50p, with one warrant attached to every five
shares. The minimum investment is Pounds 1,000, and the annual charge will
be 1.2 per cent.

FT  08 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: Bangkok's tiger roars - At a glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bangkok stock market was one of the little tigers roaring loudest last
year, gaining 88.4 per cent over the course of the year. It hit yet another
new high at the start of this week, but the last few days have seen the
market slip back on profit taking.
The foreign money pouring into south-east Asian markets, particularly from
US fund managers, is one reason behind Bangkok's performance, but local
investors have also been looking for higher returns than those from bank
deposits. The economy is growing strongly, at about 8 per cent, but shares,
particularly in the banking, financial and property sectors, are already
fully priced to take account of prospective earnings.

FT  08 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: UK House prices up by 1.2% last
year, says Halifax - At a glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
House prices in the UK rose on average by 1.2 per cent last year, the first
increase since 1990 and the highest annual rise since 1989, according to
Halifax, the largest mortgage lender. However, the annual increase was less
than half that reported by Nationwide building society, the second biggest
lender, which found that prices last year had risen by 3.3 per cent.
Prices fell by 0.5 per cent in December compared with November according to
Halifax but Nationwide reported a 0.8 per cent rise. Both societies expect
the recovery to strengthen in 1994 and Halifax predicts house prices to rise
by about 5 per cent over the course of the year.

FT  08 JAN 94 / Markets: Racy ratings in niche market - The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Capita Group, the UK's largest provider of management services to the public
sector, this week announced a streamlining of its structure.
The group's market value has increased tenfold to Pounds 105m since
flotation in 1989. It said the changes were designed to maximise the
opportunities offered by the trend for local authorities and central
government to privatise or 'outsource' an increasing number of functions.
Capita - which started as a buy-out from the Chartered Institute of Public
Finance and Accountancy - first offered consultancy and computer services
and also collects council tax and business rates for some councils and pays
benefit on their behalf.
The group has decided to merge three subsidiaries, Telecom Capita, an
information technology services company; Capita Managed Services, which
offers finance outsourcing; and Capita Management, a 50-per-cent-owned joint
venture with Serco, another contract management company.
Capita Management uses computerised telephone systems to deal with sales and
inquiries for personalised number plates on behalf of the Driver and Vehicle
Licensing Agency. Since starting in October 1990, it has sold more than
200,000 number plates and raised more than Pounds 100m for the Treasury.
Capita is paying a nominal sum for its partner's share in the joint venture,
but will continue to share profits with Serco, which was floated in 1988.
Its market value has since increased more than seven-fold to Pounds 148m.
Serco was established in 1929 by RCA to service the US group's British
cinemas, and was the subject of a management buy-out in 1987. This technical
background is reflected in the group's current diverse range of activities,
some 40 per cent of which is defence-related.
Since 1964, Serco has operated the RAF's Fylingdales missile early-warning
station in north Yorkshire, and the group is also involved in traffic
management and air traffic control.
Both Capita and Serco wish to avoid the fiercely competitive sectors, such
as cleaning or security, which have been the target of other private
contractors. The poor profit margins and low barriers to entry in these
sectors have also proved difficult for BET, the business services group.
Capita has been more successful in this respect, since most of its employees
are white-collar and are involved in revenue-generating activities for which
it can charge good rates. Serco's profit margin is more modest, at just over
5 per cent, reflecting its involvement in less specialist activities, such
as maintaining buildings and sports complexes.
This disparity is reflected in the relative performance of the two groups,
although - as the chart shows - both have massively outperformed the market
since flotation.
The extent of the outperformance - particularly in the last two years - is
perhaps the best reason for counselling caution to any prospective small
investor at these share price levels.
Both groups have a large and growing market, as outsourcing spreads from
local authorities to the NHS and into the heart of central government. Both
welcomed last month's announcement that most of the 144 government executive
agencies will be opened up to private sector bids.
The catch is that there are few quoted companies through which investment
institutions can invest in this growing area, and the share price of both
groups reflects the relative scarcity of the stock.
Capita's shares are selling on a multiple of 35 times historic earnings,
while Serco's are on more than 30 times. Such sky-high ratings leave little
margin for disappointment.
Both companies have achieved the high growth targets which they have set
themselves, but the tender system means contracts have to be competed for
again at regular intervals.
Fund managers will be glad to have such potentially interesting small
companies in their portfolios, but it would be a brave small investor who
climbed aboard the bandwagon.

FT  08 JAN 94 / Markets: Fewer pots of gold in media land - London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Michael Eisner, chairman of Walt Disney, had a disappointing week. He found
out that, for the first time in ten years as head of the Hollywood studio,
he would receive no annual bonus, mostly because EuroDisney's losses in 1993
have hurt the US parent. In 1992 he picked up Dollars 6.7m for services to
Disney's profits.
He was not the only media magnate to have a depressing start to 1994. On the
other side of the pond Sir Christopher Bland, chairman of the smaller but
perfectly formed LWT, has been trying to cobble together a band of brothers
to repel Granada's boarding party.
The complex negotiations involved trying to tie together LWT, Yorkshire-Tyne
Tees, and Anglia in a loose federation until a further change in the media
rules allowed a full merger. Unfortunately the pantomime horse proved rather
too difficult to stitch together and LWT is vulnerable to Granada's bid.
Sir Christopher will fight on the company's record and the argument that, as
a pure television company, LWT's shares will be more highly rated than
Granada's in the continuing media hype. Yet the sector has already been
re-rated and fund managers may find the profit on their LWT holdings hard to
resist. The shares ended the week up 60p to 666p. Anglia, still widely
rumoured to be in the sights of Lord Hollick's MAI, also rose 44p to 472p.
Intrigue over the future of ITV companies was given another twist by the
announcement that the government is to review the rules which restrict the
cross ownership between newspaper groups and television companies. While the
results may not be know until the autumn, the market was still speculating
that the Mirror and Telegraph Groups, Associated and United Newspapers,
Pearson (owners of the Financial Times), Reed, the Guardian and Uncle Tom
Cobbley are all about to buy television companies. Small wonder then that
media shares have maintained their Absolutely Fabulous ratings.
Overall, the market had a turbulent time. The FT-SE 100 index fell heavily
at the start of the week on worries that interest rate cuts might be
delayed. Gilts also fared badly with losses of 1 1/2 points in the first two
days. Yet worries over Christmas sales volumes, following Dixons results on
Thursday, reignited interest rate hopes. The company had not managed to sell
as many video games as in 1992, prompting fears that it had not been a merry
Christmas. Gilts bounced  5/8 of a point on Friday and the FT-SE 100
finished up 27.6 points on the week. Dixons, however, fell 41p to 244p and
dragged the sector with it.
There was also suspicion that shenanigans in the futures market, which is
based on the 100 index, were responsible for some of the volatility in blue
chip shares. By contrast second-line stocks, tracked by the FT-SE Mid 250
index, had a fine week rising 121.2 points.
Paul Walton, strategist at James Capel, says that between September 1992,
when sterling left the ERM, and September 1993, smaller stocks outperformed
blue chip shares substantially. That was mainly because interest rate cuts
and expectations of a UK recovery helped smaller cyclical manufacturing
companies more than large drug companies or food retailers. In the last
quarter of 1993, the pattern reversed as overseas buyers took a shine to big
UK stocks. Walton believes the equity market will continue to do well in the
year's first half and that smaller companies will take the lead.
Defining a company took a new turn this week as the revised FT-SE Actuaries
classifications were introduced. In general they were welcomed as a sensible
rationalisation of the system, as the structure of the market has changed
substantially since the last revision more than 20 years ago.
Some small investment impacts had been expected. James Capel says that the
roping together of the various utilities - accounting for 14.5 per cent of
the market by value - will make fund managers' recent concentration on these
stocks obvious and they may thus adjust their holdings downwards. Utilities
have underperformed the market over the past month, but it is hard to
determine whether that is because of the new classifications or other
effects.
What has been clear, at least to those who work in the City, is the debate
over who should cover which shares in the new system. Changes may well give
rise to confusion when fund managers vote on which analysts are doing well
in the annual opinion polls. Since such matters count towards annual
bonuses, the issue has attracted more than a little interest.
Another focus of attention was Eurotunnel, which reached agreement with its
banks on further fundraising. That clears the the way for the company's
second rights issue since digging started. And, with the shares rallying
strongly in the enthusiasm before the tunnel's opening in May, the issue,
due before then, may get away at a surprisingly high price. Eurotunnel ended
the week at 636p, up 26p.
Brightness in the crude oil price also brought a little winter cheer to the
oil sector. Hopes that Opec would agree to cut production at the end of
January helped the sector, with BP up 12p to 372p. Exploration companies,
more exposed to the oil price, fared even better with Enterprise up 21p at
469p.
It was also a happy new year for Ladbroke, which had been favoured in
several newspapers tips of the year columns. On Friday, Cyril Stein, who
stepped down as the company's executive chairman at the end of last year,
announced that he was also relinquishing his post as a non-executive
director. The shares rose 14p on the day to 194p, which seems a slightly
mean reward for a generation's work. But as Michael Eisner would ruefully
agree, you are not in the leisure business for fun.

FT  08 JAN 94 / Markets: It's party time - but will the Fed join in? - Wall
Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US investors started 1994 in confident fashion this week, buying enough
stocks to push the Dow Jones Industrial Average through 3,800 for the first
time. But the broader market missed out on the new year celebrations: the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 barely moved.
The gains on the Dow, and the lack of movement in the S&amp;P, indicates that
investors are responding to the latest evidence of economic strength by
pinpointing the shares of those companies likely to benefit most directly
from the acceleration in the pace of business activity.
This move into stocks sensitive to the economic cycle was most evident in
the impact the buying had upon transport issues. The Dow Jones
Transportation Average - which includes airlines, rail, freight and road
transport companies, all of which prosper alongside a buoyant economy -
climbed 2.3 per cent in the first four trading days of the week, finishing
Thursday's session at a record high of 1,802.21.
While transport and cyclical stocks climbed, other sectors languished. In
particular, small and medium sized growth company stocks, and those
sensitive to interest rates, are increasingly out of favour. These sectors
tend to perform best when an economy is struggling to pull out of a
recession.
This is because, in difficult economic times, investors seek out companies
with earnings on a fast-growth track that is independent of the business
cycle. They also invest in companies - such as utilities, banks and
securities houses - which are most likely to gain from the decline in
interest rates that usually accompanies a period of below-par growth.
Yet, the economy is now showing signs of considerable vigour and, in such a
climate, the rate of earnings growth at the big industrial companies begins
to catch up with growth rates of smaller growth-oriented companies, making
the former group's stock look a more attractive buy. Also, a stronger
economy brings the likelihood of higher interest rates, which takes the
shine off utility companies, banks and securities houses.
There can be little doubt that the economy is growing, and quite rapidly.
This week brought more good news in the form of an increase in the National
Association of Purchasing Management's monthly survey of nation-wide
manufacturing activity, in construction spending, and in factory orders.
There was also yesterday's all-important December jobs report. Although the
headline number was below market expectations - non-farm payrolls increased
by 183,000 last month, and not by well over 200,000 as analysts had forecast
 -the report gave investors the best of both worlds.
While the figures proved strong enough to sustain the belief that conditions
in the labour market are improving (albeit slowly), the fact that they came
in below market forecasts delighted the bond market, which had been troubled
all week in case the jobs report was extremely bullish on the economy. Some
analysts went so far as to say that the weaker-than-expected December
employment report could delay any tightening of monetary policy by the
Federal Reserve. Everyone expects the Fed to push up rates soon to dampen
inflationary pressures in the economy, but the big question is when.
In the past, the employment report often has been the trigger for a Fed
easing or tightening, and the thinking on Wall Street is that the Fed will
wait to raise rates until it sees clear signs of dynamic growth in the
labour market. Consequently, the stock market has at least another month's
grace period, possibly more, before facing a possible rate hike.
How investors react when rates do rise is another matter. The answer depends
on whether the many who have shifted out of short-term assets and into
equities over the past three years are fickle enough to take their money out
of the stock market at the first sign of an increase.
While there are some analysts who warn that many investors will be scared
out of equities by rising rates, the majority believes that the flood of
money into stocks since 1990 has been the result of changing demographics
and attitudes, rather than a simple knee-jerk response to very low interest
rates. Investors, the theory goes, have been buying equities for the long
term, to save for their children's education and their own retirement.
It is a compelling argument. Yet, it will not be tested when the Fed makes
its first move on interest rates because yields on short-term assets will
have to rise substantially from present levels before they look an
attractive alternative to stocks.
No, the real test will come when the Fed makes its second, third or fourth
move on interest rates, and that could be as far off as 1995.

FT  08 JAN 94 / Markets: Bruised by the cherry pickers - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cherry picking may sound like a harmless occupation but in the insurance
industry it has led to some consumers finding home and motor insurance
difficult to afford and for others, impossible to find.
The most recent issue of Which?, the Consumers' Association magazine, says
that as well as putting up prices often by 'ridiculous' amounts and paying
out on fewer claims, some insurers are refusing to quote altogether for
those considered a bad risk.
This is partly the result of a growing policy of insuring good risks while
turning down the rest - cherry picking. Insurance companies can choose whom
they insure but in some cases, the selection criteria are being applied
over-zealously, it concludes. The problem for many people is that if their
insurer refuses to renew their policy they have to declare this in
applications to other companies, lessening the chance of finding cover
elsewhere.
Which? contacted 16 insurers anonymously for quotations on a three bedroomed
house in London with two theft claims (for Pounds 900 and Pounds 1,400) in
the last year. Only one of the insurers was prepared to quote and when the
exercise was repeated, reducing the second claim to Pounds 230, only six
companies quoted.
Although the research is not rigorous - it is not clear, for example, what
type of insurance companies were contacted and some may argue that the
sample is too low - the report does draw attention to an increasing problem.
If people with a history of just two claims are regarded as 'bad risk', is
the UK heading for the type of insurance discrimination which exists in some
parts of the US, where insurers are alleged to be engaged in 'red-lining' by
refusing to insure commercially unattractive risks, often in deprived urban
areas?
The Association of British Insurers does not believe that many people find
it impossible to find cover. Companies are willing to insure them but at a
price which consumers may not be prepared to pay, it says.
However, the ABI does agree that insurers have become more selective in the
past few years in the risks they are prepared to take on.
Insurance companies have reacted to losses due to storm damage in 1990 and
subsidence in 1990 and 1991, as well as the rising number of claims.
Domestic theft claims rose steadily from under Pounds 300m in 1989 to Pounds
749m in 1992. Property insurance claims more than doubled in a single year
from Pounds 1.8m in 1989 to Pounds 4.3m in 1990 but have fallen since.
There is another reason why insurers have become more selective. Direct
writers, which sell insurance through a combination of telephone sales and
mass media advertising, have been a fast-expanding business.
Direct Line pioneered telephone-sale insurance and has made handsome profits
for its parent, the Royal Bank of Scotland by concentrating on the low-risk
market. Others have been only too happy to follow. This has been good news
for lower-risk consumers since the increased competition in the market has
allowed them to obtain cheaper insurance than before.
Large composite insurers have decided, in the main, to pass on the full cost
of increased premiums to 'bad risk' customers rather than to subsidise them
by putting up premiums for other customers. Given the competitive pressures
of the market, the insurers calculated that they would lose the good risk
customers to the direct writers.
This is where the selectivity has come in. Many insurers have changed the
way they rate risks, through measures such as postcode rating to identify
areas of subsidence or higher than average crime.
However, most of the large composite insurers are back in the black after
reaping the benefits of premium rate increases of an average 20 per cent per
year in 1991 and 1992 in the home and motor market. Does this mean that
premiums will soon come down for higher risk customers?
If too many companies are chasing too few good risks, premiums are likely to
be driven down, which indicates that there should come a point where the
less risky customers are no longer a profitable source of income.
Moreover, insurers are likely to find that they will need to be less
selective if they want to expand their business.
There are already signs that the market is changing. Direct Line is this
year to start issuing policies for 'non-standard risks' to motorists and
householders who find it difficult or expensive to obtain cover.
A number of companies have launched cheaper and less comprehensive cover for
higher-risk customers as insurers question how much holders of home
insurance policies value some of the extras - such as legal expenses cover
or freezer contents insurance - offered as a matter of course.
Brokers, the insurance industry's traditional middle men, who were cut out
by the direct writers, have ironically become more valuable than before. A
good broker will know which insurers to contact for the higher risk
customers.
In spite of the cherry picking, higher-risk customers should not despair
that they are becoming increasingly uninsurable but should continue the
time-consuming business of searching for the best insurance.

FT  08 JAN 94 / The Long View: Fuelling the markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The really hard part about forecasting what might happen to the global bond
and stock markets in 1994 is that to succeed we must first understand what
drove securities prices up so much in 1993.
We can note that the two biggest equity markets, in the US and Japan, which
account for two-thirds of global capitalisation, were sluggish last year in
local currency terms, with returns of only about 10 per cent. Generally
speaking, the smaller the market and the less the liquidity, the more likely
a strong rise. Bond markets were firm everywhere and there was a remarkable
convergence of bond yields in Europe, where returns are now packed closer
together than they ever were in the days of the European exchange rate
mechanism. Too much money and too little discrimination were the themes.
Recession and intensifying competition in traded goods can legitimately
explain the falling interest rates and inflation rates that have encouraged
bond investors. It is not so clear, however, why stock markets have joined
in the party so enthusiastically. Analysts are performing mental gymnastics
in order to justify historically very expensive ratings. Concepts such as
'cyclically adjusted margins' and 'mid-cycle earnings' are being touted
around; but shareholders in, for instance, Metallgesellschaft, this week's
leading disaster story, may perceive this as simply an exercise in 'let's
pretend'.
What we know is that the direct cause of the global bull market has been the
flow of capital out of the US into overseas bond and stock markets. In the
first nine months of 1993, net purchases reached Dollars 98bn, including
peak rates of Dollars 21bn in bonds and Dollars 25bn in equities in the
third quarter. About Dollars 7bn of the Dollars 25bn went into Latin America
and Asia (excluding Japan).
The tap has been turned on by the hugely steep yield curve (from 3 to 6.4
per cent) in the US which has generated massive movements out of deposits.
These funds have gone into, firstly, the domestic securities markets and,
more recently, into overseas markets which are viewed as offering better
value.
Conventional wisdom is that the turning point will come when the Federal
Reserve decides in its wisdom that the US economy is threatening sufficient
inflation to justify raising short-term interest rates. But is this the full
story? It is a puzzle that the Fed has been able to hold interest rates so
low without leading to a serious contraction in the US money supply, given
the weakness of bank lending. As it is, broad money has continued to grow,
albeit very slowly.
Part of the story has been that the Fed has itself been buying bonds. But
does the Fed have hidden partners in supplying the liquidity that is driving
the global capital market? After all, it seems unlikely that the US, with
its notoriously low personal savings ratio of about 4 per cent, can really
be supplying investment capital unaided on a scale which is fuelling a
world-wide bull market. The story of the late 1980s, after all, was that
America was no longer able to finance itself.
The simple arithmetic is that if Dollars 140bn annualised is flooding out
into stocks and bonds, and the US current account deficit is Dollars 100bn
plus, there must be a flow of the order of Dollars 250bn the other way,
which is replenishing dollar liquidity. The primary source of this must be
Japan, which is running a current account surplus of the order of Dollars
140bn but which, on the published figures, is no longer substantially
offsetting this through securities purchases (as it did when portfolio
investment outflows reached Dollars 120bn in 1989, mostly into dollar
bonds). The Japanese may be repaying dollar debts or purchasing money market
instruments.
The strength of the yen through much of 1993 discouraged Japanese investors
from investing overseas. Now, however, the yen seems softer again, and we
must also consider whether the weakness of the Japanese economy, a
fundamental part of the global picture, will persist for another year. The
officially-claimed third quarter annualised 2 per cent growth in GDP seemed
freakish at best to many economists and unbelievable at worst; but was it?
By propping up the busted financial system, the Japanese government is
preventing the economic meltdown which threatened to turn the 1990s
world-wide into a re-run of the 1930s, with Japan this time around replacing
the US as the focal point of debt deflation. Largely spared financial
dislocation, Japanese industry has maintained its overall output, but often
at suicidal margins, so that corporate profits have collapsed by 70 per cent
from the peak. This squeeze on profits means the price bubble in yen bonds
(10-year yields are falling through 3 per cent) has not been transferable to
equities.
If the Japanese economy stays depressed, the surplus liquidity will continue
to pour out - with the difference, perhaps, that portfolio assets might
increasingly be bought directly by Japanese institutions rather than
indirectly by American investors. Although the low level of US short rates
would then become unsustainable, the impact on markets outside the US might
not be serious if the alternative source of buying appeared. Japanese
investors would not, though, have the same tastes - south-east Asia maybe,
Latin America probably not.
Recovery in Japan's economy, however, through rising internal demand, might
quickly erode the balance-of-payments surplus and cut the flows of
liquidity. The global bull market would end. Analysts could go back to
working out next year's probable earnings per share and deciding whether an
investment made sense on that basis, rather than on make-believe
projections.
This is by no means the whole story. The continental European recession will
also generate falling interest rates and excess liquidity this year. But it
is surely the benign relationship between the American and Japanese
financial markets that holds the key. We should beware a shift in the
delicate balance.

FT  08 JAN 94 / New sexual fantasies between the covers: Out go chaste
matinee idols. In come liberated heroines, jet-setting heroes and steamy sex
scenes. What is going on at Mills and Boon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JACKIE WULLSCHLAGER

<TEXT>
'She reached up to clip her hair at the back, her body tall and slender in a
dusky pink bikini, her legs long and shapely. The water wrapped round her
like a warm blanket, unbelievably soft and caressing'
Who, on a dull day at the office, has not had a similar dream: the beach,
the sun, the beautiful girl, a frisson of romance?
Between soft covers, such dreams are worth Pounds 70m a year in the UK. More
romantic novels are sold than any other paperback fiction. More than half
come from the romantic fiction publisher Mills and Boon, which has 4m
regular readers in Britain and sells one book every two seconds. Mills and
Boon has been busy transforming its image as it launches a series of new,
updated romances for the 1990s. The matinee idol look and the stolen, chaste
kisses are out.
In come snazzy covers, racy photographs and a sophisticated logo reflecting
contemporary sweet dreams: liberated heroines, jet-setting heroes, plenty of
steamy sex scenes.
Heroines used to be 'mills and swoon' Cinderellas who sat and waited for
their prince. Today, they are independent, professional, sexually aware
women who travel the world.
In the spring, a star Mills and Boon heroine will be Atlanta reporter TJ
Harris, who accepts a marriage proposal to live with her lover at his island
resort on condition she has 'satellite television hook-ups, a computer modem
and a fax machine. Think that can be arranged?' Another will be Hollywood
agent Molly Hill, who plays sex games with her blindfold, naked hero and
then seduces him while conducting a business negotiation on the telephone:
''Yes . . . I'm . . . I'm a little out of breath from working out'. Mitch's
hand slid beneath her buttocks . . .' The change in Mills and Boon's image
this autumn is the first for nine years and reflects readers' tastes for
sexier stories and dynamic female characters.
'Heroines have definitely got more guts about them, they are much more
confident and assertive in their attitude to men - like women are today,'
says Heather Walton, Mills and Boon's marketing director. The stories, she
claims, 'mirror the lives of contemporary women' and market research is
extensively used to keep them up to date.
It shows, for example, that readers enjoy sexual realism - hence this
autumn's launch of new format 'temptation romances', with snapshots of
pouting cover girls within black borders, the word 'temptation' blazed
across the top, and scenes such as reporter TJ Harris's seduction: 'Rafe
interrupted their lovemaking only long enough to don a condom from the
nightstand drawer.' Social realism, on the other hand, is unwelcome -
readers do not, for instance, want stories involving child abuse.
This distinguishes Mills and Boon's brand of escapism from that of
television soap operas - Eastenders, Neighbours - which are driven by
topical social issues. 'But we're not here to moralise,' says Walton.
Mills and Boon is now 85 years old, and its romances are an extraordinary
cultural phenomenon: one of the most successful and long-lasting examples
this century of fantasy sold as a commodity. Early authors included PG
Wodehouse and Georgette Heyer; the company became famous in the 1930s when
the Depression created a huge market for escapist fiction.
Its books have thrived on a standard mix - 192 pages of passion between a
handsome, rich, hero and a beautiful young girl, with glamorous background
and happy ending guaranteed - ever since.
Within this fixed mould, changing sexual and social mores make the stories
fascinating cultural barometers. Injured war heroes were popular in the
1940s. Then hospitals, with dashing surgeons and blushing sisters and
self-sacrificing deeds, were common settings, and the Doctor, Nurse series
was Mills and Boon's great export success in the 1950s.
By the 1980s, the Caribbean had become a key backcloth, with a diver or
cruise-line owner as hero: a glitzy playground fantasy for the 'me'
generation.
The new-look Mills and Boon favours romanticised work settings - a Hollywood
studio, the office of Brides magazine - to match the career-girl heroines.
Are Mills and Boon romances escapist junk, tame pornography, or a brilliant
commercial packaging of fantasies that go to the heart of our collective
psyche? They are as familiar as brand names of chocolate bars - eight out of
10 women have heard of Mills and Boon. The books are competently written,
the style sophisticated and upbeat, but they lack intellectual depth, they
are sentimental and predictable and have no artistic originality.
In the literary hierarchy, they sit above the simple fictions of Barbara
Cartland but below the novels of serious authors such as Fay Weldon or Anita
Brookner - writers whose audiences are also primarily female.
Why does popular romantic fiction continue to exert a pull over modern,
liberated women? Feminist critic Alison Hennegan, editor of Open Letters,
the feminist book club, suggests the appeal for some readers lies in 'giving
yourself permission not to be bright, to read something that technically
someone like you shouldn't want to read, while thinking 'Of course I'd never
admit to finding anything attractive here, I'm only too happy to be
vice-president of my bank on my way to New York'.'
Readers can also, she says, self-consciously enjoy the 'female camp' - 'It's
such fun, my dear, it's such a wicked pleasure to suspend belief in
political correctness.'
Romantic fiction is never politically correct because it is rooted in
traditional sexual stereotypes. At its heart lie classic female fantasies
which never change. In identifying with a beautiful, beloved, lucky Mills
and Boon heroine, women readers fall in love with an idealised self-image.
Both heroine and reader see life through sensual-tinted spectacles:
themselves in that dusky, pink bikini, waiting for their lover on a beach,
writhing with desire.
Freud observed that while male daydreams are about ambition, female dreams
are erotic, women figuring themselves as objects of desire. That readers
identify with a sexually-desired woman is the key to the books' appeal -
this is why heroines must be up-to-the-minute social types. Today's reader,
for example, could not identify with a simpering, innocent war-time heroine.
But on a deeper, fantasy level, the substance of Mills and Boon has barely
changed since the 1940s.
Female sexual longing, the wish to be powerless, ravished, by a passionate
dominant man, courses through every page of romantic fiction.
'One of his conquering hands took command of her burning face. Nothing could
ever be the same again,' reads A Perfect Little Fool, a Mills and Boon
romance from 1923. 'His display of masterful jealousy excited and pleased
her. He was the lover she needed, a man who could sweep her off her feet,'
concludes Passionate Choice in 1986.
These are universal fantasies; perhaps instinctive, more likely resulting
from centuries of repression of female sexuality, so that only in images of
coercion, which do not admit their own desires, can most women really let
go. They also suggest regressive longings for unconditional love and
acceptance, Oedipal wishes for a father-protector figure.
Romantic fiction allows the female imagination, with its emphasis on
feelings, to triumph as it never does in life - the strong, worldly hero at
last admits the supremacy of the private, emotional sphere, and is brought
to his feet by love.
Beneath the slick and streetwise gloss, the new Mills and Boon novels rework
these fantasies, and that is why they will sell. Heroes remain powerful and
macho. Career girl-heroines are pretty, feminine and secretly want to be
dominated. Spiky ambitious reporter TJ Harris wears an emerald silk
nightdress and, when her lover removes it, the reader is told: 'Rafe would
take care of everything, she decided confidently, willingly surrendering
control.'
The books end in marriage, sex is always perfect, careers are often
sacrificed, and love means you can stop thinking.
In contrast, a recent novel by the feminist writer Fay Weldon concludes 'no
amount of fucking can stop you thinking'. Weldon thinks that women should
fight the desire to be dominated rather than 'lapse into the belief that you
don't have to work and struggle because somebody will always be there to
look after you'.
Her best-known novel, The Life and Loves of A She-Devil, subverts romantic
fantasy with a fat ugly heroine, Ruth, whose husband leaves her for a
beautiful romantic fiction novelist. Another cult 1980s novel, Anita
Brookner's Hotel du Lac, also features a romantic writer whose life falls
short of her rosy hued imaginings.
It is writers such as Weldon or Brookner, serious novelists with a large
popular following, whose fictions mirror the lives of contemporary women.
Mills and Boon stories record the escapist dreams.
But if these dreams do not mirror everyday lives of late 20th century woman,
they do reflect her cultural expectations. For behind them stands the ideal
of romantic love which is age-old in western civilisation. It is there in
ancient mythology - epitomised in the figure of Helen of Troy, the face that
launched a thousand ships; in medieval courtly poetry such as The Romance of
the Rose, and in the oldest folk tales, such as that of Sleeping Beauty,
awakened by a kiss from an unknown prince.
Modern romantic novels often retell such tales, while in literary terms, the
Mills and Boon formula goes back at least two centuries. Samuel Richardson's
Pamela (1739) is the story of an innocent servant girl whose master wants to
rape her but ends up marrying her. Jane Eyre, where the governess marries
her boss, the overbearing Mr Rochester, and Pride and Prejudice, where
impoverished Elizabeth Bennett marries wealthy landowner Mr Darcy, are
prototypes for popular romantic fiction. All are sexual fantasies about
older dominant men; all the heroes are tamed by the power of love.
But fairy tales and novels by Jane Austen or Charlotte Bronte have an
archetypal, literary, timeless quality which makes us return to them.
Popular romantic fiction by contrast, deals in the same myths, but does not
last. There are many reasons. Popular fiction dilutes and trivialises the
great archetypes. It gives primordial fantasies a contemporary but
too-topical veneer which soon seems dated. It excludes the element of fear
and tragedy, essential to any myth and to any mature vision of life, in
favour of sentimentality and cheap glamour.
The mythical content gives such fiction a certain power. Its roots in our
deepest sexual fantasies and longings ensure its popularity. Alison Hennegan
says of traditional romantic fiction: 'It is much less explicitly erotic -
no naughty bits get named - than lesbian or radical feminist literature,
where the sky is the limit for explicit sex.'
But for this very reason Mills and Boon novels attract those who may feel
guilty about sexual fantasies, because the erotic elements are always within
the safe context of love and marriage.
No one ever reads a Mills and Boon novel twice, or recalls a single
character or situation. Here, paradoxically, lies the commercial success:
unsatisfied, asking no more than fleeting interest, we return instead for
more, new, different, contemporary titles - Mills and Boon publish almost 30
a month. And so the market for escapist fiction will always hold: a Mills
and Boon advertisement from the 1940s, 'There's always a new Mills and
Boon', encapsulates both its strength and its weakness.

FT  08 JAN 94 / Ladbroke shares rise as Stein decides to resign early
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Cyril Stein is bowing out early from Ladbroke Group, the hotels and
leisure company he built from a small bookmaker into a member of the FT-SE
100.
Mr Stein, 66 next month, announced in September that he would step down as
chairman at the end of 1993 after 37 years at the head of Ladbroke.
He planned to stay as a non-executive director for a further three years and
to head the property division, but yesterday Ladbroke said he had decided to
resign.
The company's shares put on 14p on the news, closing at 194p, on the
expectation that Mr Stein's departure would allow new management to impose
its own style on the group. The City had feared that a formidable
personality such as Mr Stein would find it impossible to take a back seat.
But there was sadness that, as one analyst said, 'the departure of a
chairman who has done great things for the company should be greeted by a
rally'.
Mr John Jackson, who took over as chairman on January 1, said Mr Stein had
liked the idea of staying on for another three years to complete 40 years
with Ladbroke. But as December 31 approached, it became increasingly clear
that it would be better both for himself and the group if he made a clean
break.
Mr Stein, who is to receive a Pounds 200,000 payment from the company, will
remain as a consultant to Ladbroke. 'He has a massive knowledge of racing
and a very large network of contacts,' said Mr Jackson.
Analysts believe Mr Stein's departure clears the way for property disposals
and a dividend cut.
During his tenure, Ladbroke never cut its dividend.
Ladbroke shares have suffered recently because of confusion over its
dividend policy.
Early last month the company cancelled its alternative scrip dividend after
its shares fell on an announcement that it would be taking advantage of the
new foreign income dividend scheme.
FIDs are perceived to be detrimental to pension fund investors, which
benefit from tax credits on normal dividends but not on foreign income
payouts.

FT  08 JAN 94 / Corporate bias fading against Japanese cars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
French businesses, formerly the most chauvinistic in Europe when it came to
buying company cars, can no longer be relied upon to support Renault,
Peugeot and Citroen by keeping Japanese cars out of their fleets.
Corporate barriers to the purchase of Japanese cars are tumbling throughout
Europe, according to the latest survey undertaken by Monks Partnership, a UK
remuneration adviser.
In 1991, not one French-based company would own up to being prepared to buy
Japanese cars.
In Monks' latest survey of 650 companies throughout Europe, published
yesterday, 35 per cent of the more than 80 French companies surveyed said
they were opening their garages and car parks to Japanese vehicles.
Mr David Atkins, a Monks' spokesman, said: 'That doesn't mean to say that
Japanese company cars are already numerous in France. It will take time for
the effect of the policy changes to show up in cars purchased.
'Also, the figures are heavily influenced by multinationals starting to
standardise their company car policies across Europe. Nevertheless, the
trend towards greater acceptability of Japanese cars is unmistakable.'
The number of companies willing to buy Japanese cars has increased - in some
cases very sharply - in nine out of the 12 countries surveyed. Among the
biggest jumps, 80 per cent of Austrian companies say they will now allow
Japanese cars in their fleets, compared with 25 per cent in 1991; 67 per
cent of Swedish companies, up from 17; 64 per cent of Spanish companies up
from 35 and 80 per cent of Dutch companies, up from 42.
Only Italy and Denmark saw the trend put into reverse, with 42 per cent of
Italian companies prepared to buy Japanese - down from 50 per cent - and 25
per cent of Danish companies, down from 43. Half of Irish companies surveyed
would put such cars in their fleets, the same as in 1991.
Anecdotal evidence from the survey indicates that the growth in production
of Japanese cars in Europe is breaking down the deeply-entrenched resistance
to buying Japanese. European Company Car Survey 1993. Monks Partnership,

FT  08 JAN 94 / Northern Ireland peace talks head towards stalemate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Northern Ireland peace process was heading towards stalemate last night
after Sir Patrick Mayhew underlined the UK government's determination not to
respond to Sinn Fein's demands for clarification of the Downing Street
Declaration.
The Northern Ireland secretary's comments coincided with the strongest hint
yet by Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, that the IRA would not
renounce its 25-year armed struggle without such clarification.
Mr Adams told the Irish News, a Belfast-based nationalist newspaper: 'I said
always what I wanted at the end of this peace process was to end up with a
package, a proposition I can bring to the IRA in which hopefully I can make
a definitive point which will lead them to change their campaign. I don't
have such a package; I don't have such a proposition.'
Pressure on the UK government to respond to Sinn Fein's demands has been
mounting in recent days, with many leading politicians indicating they think
the request is reasonable.
Mr John Major, prime minister, has said the demands are 'an increasingly
desperate attempt to avoid facing up to the clear choice that confronts
them'.
Mr Adams last night wrote to Mr Major on the subject.
Downing Street last night confirmed that Mr Major had invited Mr John Hume,
leader of Ulster's mainly Roman Catholic Social Democratic and Labour Party,
for a meeting soon after parliament resumes on Monday.
In a move likely to be welcomed by Ulster Unionists, the government also
signalled that Mr Michael Ancram, the newly promoted Northern Ireland
minister, is to press ahead with talks with leaders of the province's four
constitutional political parties within the next two weeks.
Meanwhile, pressure mounted on Mr Adams and Mr Hume to publish details of
their agreement last year which played a large part in getting the current
peace initiative under way after a Dublin newspaper reported the Sinn Fein
president had agreed to the principle of majority consent for any
constitutional change in the province's status.
Mr Hume and Mr Adams both dismissed the reports yesterday as speculation. A
Roman Catholic man seriously wounded late on Thursday night was the first
victim of loyalist terrorists since the joint declaration was published
three weeks ago.

FT  08 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Hong Kong
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Hong Kong equity market rose by almost one third in December, so the 10
per cent decline in the Hang Seng index this week could simply be a good
old-fashioned case of profit taking. The index fell 373 points yesterday,
but closed some 300 points off the day's low. That might suggest the worst
of the selling has passed. The US threat to cut import quotas for Chinese
textiles certainly encouraged the slide. Given the colony's role as a
corridor for Chinese exports, such punitive action on trade would be a bad
omen. But other Asian equity markets have also suffered - Thailand fell by 5
per cent yesterday, Taiwan by almost as much - which hints at wider forces
at work.
The worry is that bull markets driven by liquidity are notoriously difficult
to judge. A change in sentiment which caused US or Japanese investors to
lose faith would have profound implications. A sharp rise in US interest
rates or an economic shock from China remain the most likely causes of any
eventual shift. But the latest US jobless figures are consoling on interest
rates while there is nothing to suggest that China's problems have suddenly
deteriorated.
On a multiple of perhaps 17 times this year's forecast earnings, Hong Kong
does not look especially expensive judged against its Asian rivals. But the
low depreciation charges of Hong Kong's property companies and banks flatter
the market on that measure. Judged against cash flow or asset value, Hong
Kong equities are starting to look pricey. Progress from here will be more
difficult to achieve.

FT  08 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Life insurance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The steady bonus rates announced by life insurers this week look like a
pause for breath in an otherwise downward trend. Unlike their counterparts
at pension funds, life company actuaries do not dismiss 1993's investment
returns as an aberration. The savage bonus cuts of the last two years are
not therefore being repeated. With long-term interest rates so low, though,
such heady investment returns are unlikely to be sustained.
Payouts on 10-year policies could thus decline sharply as the strong
investment returns of the mid-1980s drop out of bonus calculations. But the
pace of decline may vary between life companies more than in the past.
Insurers which switched investments in favour of gilts - often because weak
solvency demanded a less risky investment strategy - have done well from the
switch so far. With long gilt yields now at a 25-year low, though, a high
weighting in bonds may be more of a drag on investment performance.
Companies with stronger solvency may also be more likely to maintain payouts
where possible. Full disclosure of commissions and expenses - proposals for
which were released by the Securities and Investments Board yesterday -
should increase competition and may drive investors towards other forms of
long-term saving. The mis-selling of personal pensions uncovered in the
final months of last year can only be bad for business, while the market for
mortgage endowments remains depressed. Life insurers with financial muscles
will have a strong incentive to flex them.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A stronger pound and the realisation that lower base rates were not an
official priority for the new year proved only limited discouragement to the
equity market. After an initial wobble, the FT-SE 100 resumed its upward
course, due partly to buying from the US. Assuming Dixons' disappointing
Christmas was not a general reflection of the consumer mood, the conclusion
might be that the economy is strong enough to sustain equities without the
prop of a further interest rate cut. Certainly the strength of sterling
should not yet be a cause for concern. The currency has some way to go to
recoup the 1992 devaluation. Since then, productivity gains and falling
unit-labour costs have increased UK competitiveness.
Even a rise over DM2.60 need not force the authorities' hand. Perhaps with
hindsight the pre-budget cut of just half a point should be seen as a sign
of government determination to measure out the monetary largesse. At least
the authorities are conserving room to cut rates if tax rises do upset the
recovery, though it may take until summer to be sure. While that is some
comfort for equities, the prospect of a prolonged period of stable and low
rates should be better for sentiment than a deep but short-lived trough.

FT  08 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Stein steps down
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is difficult not to feel a twinge of sympathy for Mr Cyril Stein after
Ladbroke's shares rose 7 per cent on news he is not even to be a
non-executive director any more. After all, Mr Stein has spent the best part
of 40 years at the helm. The market's ingratitude has a certain logic just
the same. It was always difficult to imagine Mr Stein taking a back seat at
board meetings. His departure will strengthen Ladbroke's resolve to get out
of property and, presumably, to cut the dividend to a sustainable level.
Above all it signals that the new management, which promises to be more
open, is very much in charge.
A flow of other announcements - the appointment of a couple of strong
non-executive directors, for example, and some new faces to reinforce the
management of the betting and hotels divisions - should help maintain the
share price recovery. The new team still faces some difficult calls,
however, not least over the speed with which it sells out of property when
prices are rising and disposals could prove dilutive. Assuming no skeletons
fall out of the cupboard when the door is opened, the task should not
require further significant write-downs. Though some adjustment to hotel
values may be needed, gearing should not be a particular problem.
The dividend must still be cut simply to restore cover rather than in a bid
to conserve cash. Texas Homecare will remain difficult for some time. But
Ladbroke's other two legs will be a strongly-branded hotel operation
balanced by a cash-rich betting business which may offer opportunities for
international expansion. That is not necessarily a recipe for spectacular
growth once cyclical recovery is out of the way, but Ladbroke's attraction
would increase relative to Forte, which has had to sell some cash-generative
businesses to repair its balance sheet.

FT  08 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow spurred on by economic
outlook

Wall Street
US blue-chip stocks climbed to their third consecutive record yesterday
after the bond market rallied on an improved outlook on inflation, writes
Frank McGurty in New York.
By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 16.89 higher at 3,820.77,
while the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was 2.78 ahead at 469.90.
In the secondary markets, the American SE composite finished up 0.49 at
479.49, and the Nasdaq composite 2.53 at 782.94.
Volume on the NYSE was heavy, with 325m shares exchanged. Advancing issues
led declines, 1,271 to 585.
With the bellwether stock index above the 3,800 level for the first time,
the market opened on a firm but subdued note. An inclination to consolidate
after a four-day gain of 45 points was set against fresh optimism on the
direction of interest rates.
Cash poured into the US Treasury market after the Labor Department reported
the December non-farm payrolls had risen by 183,000, well below the
consensus forecast, but indicative of healthy economic growth.
With concern over inflation easing, the 30-year benchmark government issue
surged 1- 7/16 to 100- 9/32 in late trading, with the yield dropping about
12 basis points to 6.224 per cent.
Despite the favourable development, stocks failed to make much headway until
the afternoon, when heavy program buying helped the Dow end the week with an
appropriate flourish.
The improved outlook on interest rates helped some sectors which have
underperformed the market in recent weeks. In banking, JP Morgan climbed
Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 69 1/8 , Bankers Trust Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 78
3/4 and Chemical Bank Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 40 5/8 .
Among the Dow components which have lagged, McDonald's gained Dollars 1 5/8
to Dollars 57 1/8 and Disney Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 46 1/2 . But some of
the star cyclical stocks receded, including Du Pont down Dollars 1 1/8 to
Dollars 51 1/4 and Caterpillar Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 90 3/8 . But
International Paper, up Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 72 5/8 , remained strong.
In the day's big corporate story, Blockbuster Entertainment dropped Dollars
1 5/8 to Dollars 28 1/4 before the late announcement of its merger agreement
with Viacom, a Paramount Communications suitor. Viacom's A shares shed
Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 46 1/8 and its B shares Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 41.
QVC, which seemed to have beaten Viacom's offer for Paramount before the
Blockbuster development, jumped Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 41 5/8 . The target
company added Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 79 1/4 .
Canada
Toronto share prices ended their winning ways, recording a small loss in
continued busy trading.
The TSE-300index slipped 4.77 points, or 0.11 per cent, to 4,420.66, for a
gain on the week of about 99 points.

FT  08 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses stage turnround after
early gloom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday morning was gloomy, as Mr Albert Edwards, the Kleinwort Benson
strategist, reduced his weighting for Europe excluding the UK by a swingeing
seven percentage points, from 15 to 8 per cent.
However, bourses staged a turnround in the afternoon following the fall in
US December unemployment figures, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT moved from a fall of 8.58 to 2,211.64 on the session, down 2.4 per
cent on the week, to 2,224.95 at the end of the post-bourse. Mr Nigel
Longley of Commerzbank said that there was a lot of short covering after the
US unemployment figures.
Turnover rose from DM8.2bn to DM10.8bn. Metallgesellschaft was requoted,
falling DM52.50 to DM218 on the session and recovered a token DM4 of that in
the afternoon. Deutsche Bank, with apparently the greatest banking exposure
to the debacle, recovered DM4 to DM863 on the session, and another DM7.50 to
DM870.50 after hours.
Commerzbank announced a deep discount rights issue and a rise in dividend
which put it on a high, 4 1/2 per cent yield to German shareholders. It rose
DM2.80 on the session to DM382.50, and soared to DM391 later. Mr Peter
Thorne, banking analyst with Paribas Capital Markets in London, was
cautious: 'Commerzbank was under-provided for LDC risks a couple of years
ago,' he said, 'and there must be a suspicion in the market that it is
lagging behind in provisions for bad and doubtful debts in the corporate
sector.'
PARIS posted a strong afternoon rebound which left the CAC 40 index 32.4
higher at 2,307.55, up 1.7 per cent on the week in heavy turnover of
FFr7.4bn.
Automotive stocks, higher in mid-week on hopes of government support for the
industry, led the gains with Peugeot up FFr42, or 5.4 per cent at FFr817 and
Michelin FFr11.80, or 5.5 better at FFr226.10.
Metaleurop fell FFr6 to FFr77.40 after FFr73.30, and being suspended
limit-down at one point; Eurotunnel eased FFr2.25 to FFr56.25 on profit
 taking after weeks of steady gains.
ZURICH closed at its fifth consecutive record high with firmer US bond and
equity markets providing late support. The SMI index added 21.0 to 3,042.9
for a rise this week of 2.9 per cent.
Nestle, SFr28 higher at SFr1,343, topped the active list, and other leaders
included UBS, up SFr17 at SFr1,399, and Roche certificates, SFr105 higher at
SFr6,490.
Further demand for cyclicals took Georg Fischer bearers SFr75 higher to
SFr1,300 and BBC Brown Boveri firmed SFr21 to SFr1,150. However, Sulzer
which rose strongly earlier this week, shed SFr10 to SFr900 on
profit-taking.
Shares in Holderbank fell SFr20 to SFr965 after the cement producer said it
planned to raise its stake in Holnam, the US subsidiary, to 100 per cent
from 95 per cent.
AMSTERDAM ended an active week in subdued mood but still managed to climb
off earlier lows to book a cumulative 2.5 per cent gain on the renamed AEX
over its first five sessions. The index added 0.45 to to close at 424.02,
having posted an early intraday high of 425.41.
KLM began firm before a sudden burst of British buying took the shares up 4
per cent in about 30 minutes amid speculation that a widely expected share
issue may be imminent. After a day's high of Fl 45.00 they edged back to
finish Fl 1.50 ahead at Fl 44.60.
MILAN succumbed to immediate political worries and next Wednesday's
parliamentary vote of confidence and the Comit index shed 14.6 or 2.4 per
cent to 596.90. The index has fallen by 3.6 per cent over the week.
Montedison dominated trading, as it has all week, dipping L9 to L885.90.
Heavy arbitrage with its rights issue accounted for volume of 40m shares.
Ferruzzi shed L252 or 15.5 per cent to L1,427 also amid arbitrage with its
rights. Monday is the last day for both cash calls.
BRUSSELS hit yet another high, the Bel-20 index ending 8.81 better at
1,498.22 for a gain of 1.7 per cent on the week, helped by an interest rate
cut late on Thursday by the Banque Nationale de Belgique.
STOCKHOLM found firm demand which took the Affarsvarlden general index 36.2
or 2.5 per cent higher at a record 1,475.0.
Hennes &amp; Mauritz, the retailer, closed SKr26 or nearly 10 per cent higher at
SKr298 amid expectations that a controversial advertising campaign could
have the same impact on sales as one two years ago that featured the model,
Cindy Crawford.
B shares in Gambro, the medical equipment company rose SKr14 to SKr395 on
expectations of strong growth in the price.
ATHENS ended 5.7 per cent higher on the day and 12.4 per cent better on the
week, the general index closing 58.44 higher at 1,077.83 on technical and
sentiment grounds.

Last minute arbitrage buying pushed up share prices, and the Nikkei closed
above the 18,000 level for the first time since December 17, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue index rose 242.02 to 18,124.01 after a low of 17,787.48 and a
high of 18,131.41. The Topix index of all first section stocks rose 11.75 to
1,481.02.
Trading was dull, with financial institutions and corporate investors taking
small lot profits. However, a rise in the futures market in the afternoon
triggered a late flurry of buying. US mutual and pension funds were placing
buying orders in laggard stocks.
Volume totalled 300m shares against 362m. Advances outpaced declines by 640
to 381, with 148 unchanged. In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 6.90 to
1,237.12.
Afternoon reports that the government was considering reducing the
securities trading tax as part of the emergency economic package also
generated buying.
Telecommunications related stocks continued to rise on the government's
plans to refurbish the country's telecom system to allow multi-media access,
revealed on Thursday. NEC, the most active issue of the day, rose Y56 to
Y962 and NTT by Y8,000 to Y787,000.
Drug and bio-technology issues were higher on reports that the government
will provide financial aid to developing countries facing the spread of the
Aids virus. Ajinomoto, a foods manufacturer developing an anti-Aids drug,
rose Y30 to Y1,360.
Some export oriented stocks, which have been supported by foreign buying
lost ground on profit taking. Sony fell Y40 to Y5,750.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 95.95 to 19,851.16 in volume of 31.3m shares.
Roundup
Aggressive profit-taking led to sharp falls across the Pacific Rim as
Kleinwort Benson added its voice to those strategists advising clients to
shift their investments.
BANGKOK saw heavy selling by institutions and individuals and the SET index
plunged 92.51 or 5.5 per cent to 1,575.43 in hefty turnover of Bt33.74bn.
KUALA LUMPUR gave in to profit-taking for the second straight day and the
composite index fell 4.6 per cent, taking the cumulative two day fall to
10.1 per cent. The composite index gave up 57.96 to 1,190.73 for a 6.6 per
cent fall over the week.
MANILA shed 4.1 per cent as profit-taking took hold after PDLT's Dollars 3
fall to Dollars 76 1/2 on Wall Street. The composite index fell 133.72 to
3,159.56.
TAIWAN plunged 3.9 per cent on heavy profit-taking in a correction from a
bull run which saw the index soar 23 per cent in the previous eight
sessions.
The index opened slightly higher but soon fell and ended 253.93 down at
6,200.59, still 2.1 per cent up on the week.
HONG KONG suffered a 3.3 per cent fall as local and overseas investors took
profits, for a cumulative two day decline on 9.6 per cent. The Hang Seng
index fell 373.02 to 11,001.48, after a day's low of 10,611.73, in record
turnover of a provisional HKDollars 15.23bn. The market shed 9.2 per cent in
the week.
The futures market also was down sharply with the January contract down 260
at 10,880.
AUSTRALIA share market fell for the first time in more than two weeks, as
investors took profits in blue chip issues. The All Ordinaries index closed
14.3 down at 2,186.0, 0.6 per cent higher over the week.
SINGAPORE closed lower for the third straight day, and the Straits Times
Industrials index fell 21.86 to 2,366.40, 2.4 per cent lower on the week,
but well above the intra-day low of 2,304.62.
JAKARTA closed lower in slow late trading, with profit-taking dampening
sentiment. The market index fell 1.63 to 607.69 but was still 3.2 per cent
higher this week.
BOMBAY surged as foreign investors and domestic institutions bought a wide
spectrum of shares after the exchange fixed carry forward costs at a less
than expected 2.0-2.25 percent. The BSE-30 index rose 152.73 or 4.3 per cent
to 3,662.20.
SEOUL moved higher for the third consecutive session in spite of selling
pressure from the Korea Stock Market Stabilisation Fund which eclipsed an
early advance. The composite stock index added 2.08 to 895.25.
NEW ZEALAND closed at a 51-month high, the NZSE-40 capital index rising
25.34 to 2,224.16, up 1.6 per cent on the week.

FT  08 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets: Analysts differ on US equity targets in
1994 - The outlook for Wall Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Although the US stock market posted solid enough gains in 1993 (the Dow
Jones Industrial Average rose almost 14 per cent and the Standard &amp; Poor's
500 by 7 per cent), they paled in comparison to the stellar performance of
many overseas equity markets.
Wall Street last year lagged behind the main bourses in Europe, where share
prices rose by an average of 39 per cent, primarily because the US was at a
different stage in the interest rate cycle.
Having fallen sharply in 1991 and 1992, interest rates stabilised in the US
last year, albeit at historically very low levels. In comparison, interest
rates in Europe were still on the way down throughout 1993.
What is more, European rates look as if they have further to fall as
Germany, France, and to a lesser extent, the UK, ease monetary policy to
boost economic growth. In the US, however, rates can only go one way: up.
That means the US may again be outshone by foreign markets in 1994, even
although stocks in Europe will find it tough to match last year's returns.
So what do strategists at the top securities houses on Wall Street expect
the US market to do this year? Although there is a reasonable consensus
about how the economy and interest rates will perform - the former will
grow, but not particularly strongly, while the latter will rise, but not
particularly far or fast - and a general agreement that corporate earnings
will continue to improve, there are differences over how share prices will
move.
Wall Street's most well-known optimist is Elaine Garzarelli, the
high-profile market analyst at Lehman Brothers, who expects stocks to rise
between 10 per cent and 15 per cent this year. If her most optimistic
forecast is met, the Dow will end the year at over 4,300, and the S &amp; P at
535.
Her confidence is based upon the expectation that short-term interest rates
will not rise by much in 1994. Although the health of the economy will
continue to improve, inflation will remain unthreatening (primarily because
of low oil prices), so market and Fed pressure on interest rates will not be
particularly strong.
The only thing that could unsettle the market seriously, says Ms Garzarelli,
would be a big rise in long-term interest rates - like a jump in the 30-year
Treasury bond yield from its current 6.3 per cent to 7.2 per cent. This, she
says, is unlikely.
At the other end of the spectrum is David Shulman, chief equity strategist
at Salomon Brothers, who is distinctly bearish about 1994. Mr Shulman
eschews a Dow forecast, but expects the S&amp;P 500 to trade in a range between
420 and 480 (the index is currently trading around 467).
His reasoning for the gloomy prognosis is simple. In 1993, the market
performed well because of four factors: a once-in-a-generation long bond
rally; a Dollars 5 decline in the price of oil; 18 per cent growth in
corporate operating profits; and a friendly Federal Reserve. None of these
positive influences, however, will be present this year, says Mr Shulman.
Instead, he believes that the Fed will tighten monetary policy, the bond
market will not rally, the oil price will hold near current levels, and
operating profits will grow by only 11 per cent. Liquidity will also shrink,
as the rise in interest rates slows down the flow of money out of short-term
assets and into equities. 'Everybody's complacent' about market prospects,
he warns.
In between Ms Garzarelli and Mr Shulman lie the majority of Wall Street
forecasts. One of the more bullish firms is SG Warburg, which has set a
target for 4,200 on the Dow and 530 on the S&amp;P. Like Ms Garzarelli, the
Warburg analysts Gail Dudack and Jennifer Ludington are confident that
inflation will remain low during the year. Like many others, they also
envisage solid profitability gains by US companies.
Abby Cohen, the chief strategist at Goldman Sachs, sits roughly in the
middle of the forecasting range. She is looking for stocks to rise about 10
per cent. She also makes the point, echoed across Wall Street, that equities
will be increasingly decoupled from the bond market. Unlike 1993, when the
bond market rally kept share prices buoyant, she expects equities
significantly to outperform bonds.
Where Ms Cohen stands out from the crowd, however, is in her assertion that
stocks are undervalued by as much as 15 per cent on the S &amp; P in relation to
inflation and interest rates. She explains: 'Our valuation approaches make
the key assumption that investors are willing to pay more for a given level
of earnings, cash flow or dividends when inflation and interest rates are
not troublesome.' Hence she believes that inflation and bond yields will
remain low in 1994.
As for what Wall Street analysts have to say about particular sectors in the
market, the central message to investors is stick with
economically-sensitive stocks, stay away from interest rate-sensitive
stocks, look out for companies with exposure to what should be an improving
European economy, and keep an eye on the entertainment and media sector,
especially the companies that will provide the programming for the
multi-media age.

<TEXT>
An uncertain opening in the derivatives market was turned to strength by the
welcome re-appearance of US buyers following confirmation that the US
employment figures for December were much better than feared, writes Terry
Byland.
The March contract rose very strongly on the news, driven by demand from
several of the best-known US securities firms.
At best, the contract was at a 30 point premium to cash and there was
considerable arbitraging between futures and equities. At the close, March
stood at 3,465, still a 20-point premium to cash the and 7 on the fair value
premium. Volume was heavy at 17,709 contracts.
In traded options, where turnover increased to 54,739 contracts, the FT-SE
traded 13,717 on the renewed interest in the blue chip issues, against only
9,801 on Thursday when investors favoured the smaller stocks. The Euro FT-SE
at 9,723 contracts was also busy.

FT  08 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Wellcome rallies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO and CLARE GASCOIGNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
News of the pricing structure for SmithKline Beecham's new herpes treatment
Famvir saw a sharp turnaround in sentiment for Wellcome as investors decided
it lessened the chances of a price war with the latter's Zovirax drug.
Wellcome shares, which had been 16 adrift at one stage, rallied on the news
that Famvir would only be marginally cheaper than Zovirax, and closed 7 up
at 689p. Analysts had been expecting a price differential of up to 25 per
cent in favour of Famvir. SmithKline added a penny to 395p. Mr Andrew Porter
at UBS said that the diminished prospects of a herpes price war was good
news for both companies.
Elsewhere in the drugs sector, Medeva announced the development of a new
oral vaccine for hepatitis with Proteus International. The former jumped 9
to 149p, and the latter 17 to 448p.
The strong market trend, a weighty broker's recommendation and figures from
the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders showing an 11.6 per cent rise
in the number of new cars sold last year all combined to boost the motor
dealing stocks.
A buy recommendation from UBS favoured Lex Service, where the shares jumped
27 to 482p, Evans Halshaw, up 17 at 432p, and Appleyard Group, 7 better at
148p. The broker said: 'We remain particularly positive on UK car dealers
which are in the early stages of recovery and generally well financed.' A
Kleinwort Benson recommendation continued to power Reg Vardy and the shares
put on 8 to 193p.
Shares in T&amp;N jumped 16 to 232p, with Credit Lyonnais reported to have had
the day's big buyer. Smith New Court were also said to be recommending the
stock.
Rank Organisation refused to comment on market rumours that the leisure
group would announce a new non-executive chairman with its results next
week. Strongly being tipped for the post is the chairman of SG Warburg, Sir
David Sholey. Rank shares added 3 to 1034p.
A positive note from NatWest Securities boosted several stocks in the oil
sector. These included BP, 1 1/2 firmer at 372 1/2 p in volume of 8.2m,
while Enterprise Oil finished 7 ahead at 469p, with Smith New Court said to
favour the stock.
Food retailers continued to attract interest. Kwik Save was helped by a UBS
recommendation and the shares climbed 10 to 627p. Argyll added 6 to 305p.
Stores stocks largely shrugged off the frosty Christmas message from Dixons
on Thursday. Argos, which had retreated on the former's profit warning,
rebounded 9 to 383p. But Kingfisher was again under pressure on fears that
its Comet subsidiary may have suffered the same fate as Dixons. The shares
slid 18 to 729p. Burton ,where talk in the market suggests margins may also
be under pressure, slipped a penny to 67 1/2 p. Dixons rallied 4 to 244p.
However, talk of strong high street sales in non-electrical goods was
confirmed after the market closed by Allders, which said its December sales
were 10 per cent higher. The shares were up 12 at 230p at the market close.
Improved trading at Lloyds Chemist saw the shares add 3 to 358p.
In a strong media sector, United Newspapers fell 23 to 662p, believed to be
on a downgrading from NatWest Securities. Bid speculation over Reuters
continued, pushing shares up 41 to 1864p.
Shares in Tomkins advanced 8 to 262p in trade of 4.7m. NatWest Securities
yesterday issued a buy recommendation on the stock.
Meanwhile, SG Warburg upgraded its stance on the electricity sector to
overweight, although cautioned on possible earnings disappointments in the
spring results season. Panmure Gordon was also positive, tipping Northern
Electric, up 28 to 724p, as its Rec for 1994.
Further weakness in the property majors ended a glum week for the leaders
which have failed to build on their strong year-end performance. Worst hit
yesterday were Land Securities, down 2 to 770p, and MEPC, off 4 to 516p.
However, Mr Robert Kynoch at NatWest Securities remains positive. 'The
fundamentals that supported the market in 1993 have not changed,' he said.
Share listed in the FT are now arranged according to a revised list of
industry sectors. A full alphabetical listing of stocks together with the
new sectors in which they can be found is contained in this issue. An
explanation of the changes can be found on page III of the Weekend FT.

FT  08 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Ladbroke surge continues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO and CLARE GASCOIGNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The week's phenomenal run by Ladbroke continued apace yesterday, the shares
gaining further support in the wake of the announcement that Mr Cyril Stein,
the retiring chairman, would not be taking up his non-executive position on
the board. Leisure analysts said that while the surprise news strengthened
the chances of the dividend being cut, a move always strongly resisted by Mr
Stein, it augured well for the company's attempts to reduce its debts. As
well as giving the new management a freer rein, it is also expected to hurry
the appointment of other non-executive directors. There were also reports
that the company would join forces with media group MAI to mount a bid for
the National Lottery.
Ladbroke shares jumped 14 to 194p in another day's hefty turnover of 11m.
The stock, which has been among a number of brokers and pundits tips of the
year for 1994, has now risen nearly 20 per cent in the past four days. Mr
Mark Finnie at NatWest Securities, a long-time Ladbroke supporter, said:
'Clearly the market has had its concerns over Mr Stein's potential new role.
We do anticipate however that this announcement signals the beginning of a
more positive news flow from the company, and we expect further
outperformance.'

FT  08 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: US buyers return to boost FT-SE 100
stocks - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The London stock market rounded off the first week of 1994 with a convincing
display of confidence yesterday afternoon when excellent news on US
employment soothed fears that interest rates might be forced higher on the
other side of the Atlantic. Renewed buying of stock index futures by the big
US securities houses drove the FT-SE Index up by 43 points to 3,446, within
16 points of the previous closing high reached just after Christmas.
Although the US payroll statistics appeared to have been leaked on the
previous day, London warmly welcomed the formal announcement that non-farm
payrolls had risen by a mere 183,000 in December, far below market
estimates. Nervousness over prospects for rates in the US earlier this week
had helped unsettle London's confidence that domestic base rates would be
reduced in the near term.
At first, the UK market seemed set for another uncertain performance, with
the Footsie stocks lacking support while the FT-SE Mid 250 Index continued
to blaze ahead. But share prices began to move up half an hour before the US
news came.
On the announcement, the March contract on the Footsie jumped to a
substantial premium and London traders identified several of the large US
buyers of the London futures who had pushed the Footsie ahead in December.
A brief pause for consolidation was followed by a renewed advance as the
marketmakers again found themselves short of stock to meet the assault. The
Footsie has moved erratically this week as marketmakers have sought to
rebuild trading books which were badly stretched during the hectic advance
just before Christmas.
However, the refocusing of attention on the Footsie stocks did nothing to
slow progress in the FT-SE Mid 250 Index, which climbed 63.5, breaking
through a new barrier to close at a new peak of 3,912.5.
At last night's close of the first leg of the equity account, the FT-SE 100
Index showed a gain of 27.6 on the week but the FT-SE Mid 250 was 121.2
points or 3.2 per cent ahead.
The recovery of confidence seen over the past two sessions has been
reflected in high trading volume. On Thursday, Seaq volume of 1.02bn shares
brought retail business worth Pounds 2.02bn, one of the best daily totals
for twelve months. However, Seaq business increased again yesterday,
totalling 1.05bn shares.
The soothing of interest rate worries also inspired the gilt edged market,
where short dated issues moved higher. The best gains, however, came in the
longer dates where renewed confidence that inflationary pressures will stay
low added as much as 3/4 of a point to bond prices. Index-linked gilts,
after a slow start, edged higher towards the end of the session.
Equity traders expressed satisfaction with the resilience of the stock
market over the past two sessions, which has seen the Footsie bounce over 90
points from Thursday morning's low point of 3,355.
Earlier in the week, the market had run into profit-taking as fund managers
showed signs of turning away from the highly rated Footsie-listed stocks,
preferring to move towards the FT-SE Mid 250 list.
The re-appearance of US buyers for London equities was regarded as highly
positive for the UK market and lends support to the highly favourable
forecasts for the first half of 1994 from most local market analysts.

FT  08 JAN 94 / Markets Report: Dollar doubts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The pace of economic recovery in the US was the focus of market attention
yesterday, after the publication of weaker-than-expected US non-farm payroll
data, writes Gillian Tett.
This was partly tempered by an improved unemployment figure. But with market
sentiment mixed about the strength of the US recovery, the dollar softened
slightly, while the D-Mark made small gains.
Publication of the US data had provoked considerable market speculation,
after Mr Robert Reich, US labour secretary, broke with protocol on Thursday
and predicted a disappointing figure. In the light of the dollar's recent
bull run, his comment fuelled fears that the market might have been overly
optimistic about the pace of US recovery.
In the event, the non-farm payroll rose by 183,000 in December, compared to
the market consensus of 215,000. Unemployment in December fell to a
three-year low of 6.4 per cent, down from 6.5 per cent the previous month.
The announcement triggered a small slide in the dollar against both the
D-Mark and the yen. Though the dollar then bounced off technical support at
DM1.7350, as markets reassessed the employment number, it finally closed at
DM1.733, almost half a pfennig weaker than the previous day. It also slid
against the yen, closing at Y111.8, down from the previous close of Y112.6.
With market opinion divided about the speed of the US recovery, the dollar
is likely to fluctuate within a narrow range in coming days, dealers said.
'A battle is going on between dollar bulls and dollar bears. It is not clear
which side will win out,' said Mr Peter Luxton, of Barclays Bank.
Consequently the publication of the US PPI and CPI figures on Wednesday and
Thursday this week is likely to attract particular attention. As Mr Rob
Loewy, head of Foreign Exchange at Midland Global Markets, points out, if
this week's figures point to weaker-than-expected levels of inflation, hopes
about the strength of the US recovery could be further damped.
The D-Mark, by contrast, recovered slightly yesterday, after weakening on
Thursday amid speculation that the Bundesbank's refusal to cut rates this
week would force a cut later this month.
The French franc closed at FFr3.403 per D-Mark compared to a previous close
of FFr3.396. Sterling's recent advances against the D-mark were also halted
and it closed at DM2.583, down from DM2.589.
The key reason for the D-Mark's rise was a comment from Mr Hans Tietmeyer,
Bundesbank president, on Thursday indicating that the bank had a steady
rates policy for the time being.
'The Bundesbank is trying hard to dent market speculation that it might cut
interest rates,' said Mr Ian Gunner, international economist with Chase
Manhattan.
The Irish Central Bank cut its short-term facility rate to 6.75 per cent
from 7.0 per cent, and its overnight deposit rate to 3.50 per cent from 3.75
per cent. Although some dealers had earlier speculated that the Irish Bank
would wait for a German before trimming its own rates, the move appears to
have been triggered by the recent strengthening of the Irish currency which
is currently by far the strongest currency in the EMS grid, above its
pre-August upper limit against the D-Mark. The punt closed at DM2.474 down
from DM2.482 the previous day.
The Bank of England yesterday provided the UK money market with Pounds 1.41
billion of assistance, after forecasting a Pounds 1.4bn liquidity shortage.

FT  08 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture (Week in the Markets): Gold
price fails to hold gains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The gold market was left treading water this week after a buying surge
proved insufficient to buoy the metal's price to the Dollars
400-a-troy-ounce level.
Having begun the new year with a Dollars 3.50 jump, aided by a strong rise
in silver, the gold price added another Dollars 2.35 on Wednesday to reach a
five-month peak of Dollars 396.60 an ounce. But the two-day advance was
wiped out on Thursday as computer programmes used by some US institutional
investors sent out almost unanimous 'sell' signals.
The fall, which took the price to Dollars 385.25 an ounce at one point, was
seen by some analysts as representing merely a badly-needed pause for breath
before a fresh assault on the Dollars 400 barrier. However, Mr Ted Arnold,
analyst at the Merrill Lynch financial services group, warned that physical
demand for gold was 'dropping like a stone'.
The price recovered to close yesterday at Dollars 388.25 an ounce, down
Dollars 2.50 on the week, but dealers told the Reuter news agency that stiff
resistance was building in the Dollars 390s. 'What we are seeing now is the
difference between dealers' ambitions for the new year and what the market
can actually do,' said one.
The silver market, which had been pushed sharply higher on concern over the
risings in Mexico, also surrendered its gains, the cash price in London
ending at Dollars 5.05 1/2 an ounce, down six cents on the week.
News of big rises in London Metal Exchange warehouse stocks pushed copper
and zinc prices still lower yesterday, after both metals had already
sustained substantial falls earlier in the week.
Last week's end-year profit-taking in the copper market spilled over into
Tuesday's trading, when the three months price fell Dollars 36 to Dollars
1,752.25 a tonne. A Dollars 17 bounce on the following day had been wiped
out by yesterday's close.
Defying the downtrend was aluminium, which shrugged off news of another LME
stocks increase to rise Dollars 3 yesterday to Dollars 1,149.50 a tonne in
the three months position, up Dollars 24.25 on the week. Dealers explained
that buyers were being encouraged by hopes of progress at the next
multilateral meeting on stemming the Russian aluminium supply glut, which is
scheduled to be held in Brussels later this month.
A depressed week for cocoa prices ended with further losses yesterday in
response to rumours of an imminent devaluation of the CFA franc, the
currency of, among others, the Ivory Coast, the world's biggest cocoa
producer. At the London Commodity Exchange the May futures price dipped to
Pounds 893 a tonne at one stage, before ending the day at Pounds 906, down
Pounds 23 on the week and Dollars 40 below Tuesday's peak.
LCE coffee futures fared somewhat better, the March position closing
yesterday at Dollars 1,194 a tonne, down Pounds 5 on the day and Pounds 4 on
the week, after trading between Dollars 1,181 and Dollars 1,209.
Seasonal cheer came late to the oil market, which had ended 1993 near 5-year
lows. A change of sentiment this week saw the London International Petroleum
Exchange's March Brent blend futures position climb to a high of Dollars
14.51 a barrel before easing to Dollars 14.33 in late trading yesterday,
still up 93 cents the week.
Mr Nauman Barakat, a vice-president for energy futures with Merrill Lynch in
New York, told Reuter that market psychology had changed in the short-term
and speculators were 'buying dips rather than selling rallies'.

FT  08 JAN 94 / International Company News: Pacific Telesis to cut 10,000
jobs

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Pacific Telesis, the San Francisco-based Baby Bell telephone company, is to
take a Dollars 576m fourth-quarter reserve to cover a corporate
restructuring which will eliminate 10,000 jobs by the end of 1997.
This is the latest of several large job-cutting programmes announced in
recent months by America's local telecommunications companies as new rivals
nibble away at their traditional monopolies.
It follows the spin-off at the end of last year of Pacific Telesis's mobile
communications businesses into a separately quoted company. The reserve,
with additional charges of Dollars 89m, will reduce fourth-quarter earnings
by Dollars 1.58 a share.
The job cuts involve Pacific Bell, Pacific Telesis's most important
business, which serves the Californian telephone market. It plans to cut
3,000 jobs in 1994 and 7,000 more over the next three years. The subsidiary
employs about 52,000 people.
Pacific Bell said the move formed part of a redesign of the company using a
management technique called process re-engineering, which involves an
examination of the way tasks are performed.
It is instituting a cost-cutting programme, including a reduction of
management levels and deferred executive salary increases.
'This will improve customer services, meet our customers' need for lower
prices and further prepare us for expanded competition,' said Mr Phil
Quigley, Pacific Bell's president.
Pacific Bell announced two months ago that it would spend Dollars 16bn to
create a multi-media communications superhighway across its territory - one
of the largest network modernisation programmes announced by local US
telephone companies.

FT  08 JAN 94 / International Company News: Preussag rescues French metals
division
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Preussag, the German engineering and metals group, is to prop up its ailing
French subsidiary MetalEurop with a capital injection of between DM120m and
DM150m (Dollars 71m-Dollars 88m).
In spite of reassurances of a satisfactory group result for 1992-93 even
after allowing for MetalEurop's losses, Preussag's share price dropped
DM15.50 to DM451 in Frankfurt yesterday.
The stock market setback was sharpened by rumours of a FFr400m (Dollars
67.8m) deficit at the French subsidiary and uncertainty generated by the
crisis at Metallgesellschaft, which this week asked banks and shareholders
to fund a bail-out package valued at DM3.2bn.
Preussag offered no information on the extent of losses, although a
statement from MetalEurop said they would be markedly higher than the
previous year's FFr167m because of rapidly falling prices for lead and zinc,
its main products.
The business was FFr142m in the red for the first six months of last year.
In return for the rescue, Preussag will take a 49 per cent stake in the
subsidiary's die-casting and galvanisation businesses in Germany.
The price of the stake will be fixed by independent auditors.

<TEXT>
Groupe Fournier, the French pharmaceuticals, chemicals and adhesives group,
yesterday said that it was in an advanced stage of negotiations concerning
the acquisition of some of the pharmaceuticals activities of Pharmacia of
Sweden.
The negotiations involve the purchase of the pharmaceuticals operations of
Pierrel Pharma Laboratories, a division of Pharmacia, which was formerly
part of Sweden's Procordia group.
Groupe Fournier said the planned acquisition was aimed at strengthening its
position in the Italian pharmaceuticals market. Pierrel Pharma is based in
Milan and would be linked with Groupe Fournier's existing Italian interests,
including Farmasister.
A statement from Groupe Fournier said that it was under-represented in
Italy, Europe's third largest drugs market. It said the company regarded
Italy as an important strategic market in spite of the introduction of
health care reforms aimed at reducing the level of health and
pharmaceuticals expenditure.
Groupe Fournier achieved sales of about FFr2.9bn (Dollars 491.5m) last year,
about one third of which came from its pharmaceuticals businesses.

FT  08 JAN 94 / International Company News: Commerzbank seeks DM950m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Commerzbank, Germany's third-biggest stock market listed bank, yesterday
unveiled plans for a DM950m (Dollars 559m) rights issue, sweetening the
offer with a promise of a DM2 dividend increase to DM12 for 1993.
The bank attempted to sharpen appetites for the new shares with the promise
that interesting business prospects in its financial services operations
would have a favourable impact on 1994 results.
The issue, which follows a smaller financing move early last year, will mean
Commerzbank will increase equity capital to DM16bn and achieve its aim of
raising the bank's capital-to-assets ratio to 5 per cent from 4.6 per cent
in one step.
As on the occasion of the last rights issue, the latest issue is not
supported by a full-year profits forecast. However, Mr Martin Kohlhaussen,
chairman, was careful to give an informal preview of strong 1992 results
last January, just days before the subscription period opened. Last
November, he announced profits ahead 52 per cent for the first 10 months of
1993.
Shareholders will be able to subscribe to this year's issue - a 1-for-10 at
DM315 a share - between January 24 and February 7. The new shares will be
eligible for dividend payments from January 1994, the bank said in a
statement.
Commerzbank stock has recently been trading at around DM380 compared with a
12-month peak of DM400, which was reached amid rumours of a possible
takeover, and which helped the company's shares outperform those of other
big banks.
However, all German banks last year increased their provisions against bad
debts. They expect this year to feel the impact of recession. Moody's
Investors Services downgraded Commerzbank's long-term credit rating last
October.
Credit watch agencies believe German corporate insolvencies will increase by
about 25 per cent this year.
Commerzbank's DM2 dividend increase includes a DM1 payment attributable to a
recent lowering of corporate tax rates, which many banks have said they will
pass on to shareholders.
Bankgesellschaft Berlin has set a price of DM384 for its 5-for-8 rights
issue. Bankgesellschaft Berlin comprises Berliner Bank, Berliner Hypotheken-
und Pfandbriefbank and Landesbank Berlin.
All three banks expect satisfactory results for 1993.

<TEXT>
Mr Swraj Paul, chairman of Caparo, the UK-based steel group, yesterday
signed an agreement with Maruti Udyog, the Indian car manufacturer and
Machino Techno Sales, a Delhi-based plastic auto-parts maker, to set up a
Rs400m (Dollars 12.7m) steel metal stamping shop near Delhi.
Mr Paul will own 60 per cent of Caparo Maruti, while Maruti Udyog and
Machino Techno Sales, a Maruti joint-venture company, will each hold 20 per
cent.
The new company, due to start production in April 1995, will be located at
Maruti's joint venture complex at Gurgaon, 25km from Delhi. It will augment
Maruti's steel metal pressing capacity with an 800-tonne press line,
possibly rising to 1,200 tonnes.
This is the first investment that Mr Paul, a London-based non-resident
Indian industrialist, has made in India.
Maruti, a joint venture between the Indian government and Suzuki Motor of
Japan, plans to increase production to 230,000 cars by 1996. The company,
until recently wholly government-owned, achieved a turnover of Rs22.22bn
last year.
Caparo has steel stamping plants in Spain and in the UK.

Metallgesellschaft shares

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Metallgesellschaft's share price fell almost 20 per cent in Frankfurt
yesterday following a turbulent session in which the loss-ridden group's
shareholder banks pitted themselves against speculators.
After a day's suspension to allow markets to digest revised losses of
DM1.8bn (Dollars 1.1bn) last year and the call on creditor banks and
shareholders for DM3.2bn in aid, the shares closed down DM52.50 on
Wednesday's price at DM218. The price had fluctuated between DM202 and
DM227.
Traders expected more erratic movements early next week, at least until
Wednesday, when creditor banks are due to respond to rescue proposals
prepared by the new management and Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank, the
group's shareholder-cum-house banks.
Analysts believed the banks would provide the necessary backing, basing
their judgment on the relatively modest loss in the shares value yesterday.
Traders said shareholder banks were clearly supporting the stock to make
sure the planned new share issue, priced at DM250, remained practicable.
Longer-term prospects for the share price were unclear, although Mr Kajo
Neukirchen, the new chairman, may offer more indications of his
restructuring plans at a press conference, provisionally set for late next
week.
Most interest is focused on a list of planned disposals from among the
company's 250-odd subsidiaries of which few clear details have yet appeared.
Mr Neukirchen has undertaken to reduce group payroll costs by up to DM700m a
year.
Mr Neukirchen has taken over a company with a potential total loss of
DM3.3bn, including a possible DM1.5bn in losses which may be incurred in
unwinding New York oil futures positions.
His predecessor, Mr Heinz Schimmelbusch, sacked just before Christmas, is
under criminal investigation, it emerged yesterday. The Frankfurt public
prosecutors office has taken up the case following a complaint by a small
shareholder.
Mr Schimmelbusch and Mr Meinhard Forster, the finance director who was fired
at the same time, are being investigated for alleged breaches of the German
Companies Act. The main complaint relates to their failure to report a loss
which exceeded half the company's equity base.
Last November the company formally announced a pre-tax deficit of DM347m for
the year to the end of September.

FT  08 JAN 94 / Renault sees profit despite downturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Renault, the French state-owned motor group, should report a profit for last
year in spite of the sharp downturn in the European car market, Mr Patrick
Faure, the company's assistant managing director said yesterday.
Presenting sales figures for last year, Mr Faure said the decline in the
European market, which contracted by about 2m vehicles, would have 'a major
financial impact on Renault's results'. But he expected a small profit would
still have been achieved.
In 1992, Renault reported net profits of FFr5.7bn (Dollars 966m).
Mr Faure said he expected slight growth in the French and European car
markets but cautioned that predictions were difficult as car markets had
become more volatile.
Renault's total sales of cars and light commercial vehicles fell by about 12
per cent last year to 1.76m units, while its western European sales fell by
16.5 per cent to 1.4m units. Mr Faure said the decline was the equivalent to
the output of one of its factories, while the contraction of the European
market as a whole, to 12.6m units, was equivalent to the output of a large
car producer.
In spite of the depressed markets, the French group noted some bright spots.
It said it had maintained its share of the European passenger car market at
10.6 per cent and had increased its share of the French market to 30.6 per
cent from 29.5 per cent.
Renault's position in the small car market was strengthened by the launch of
the Twingo, which received 140,000 orders between its launch in April and
the end of the year. Together with the Clio and the Superfive, the Twingo
prompted an increase in Renault's share of France's small car sales to 40
per cent from 33 per cent. In Europe, the UK was the only market to show an
overall improvement last year and Renault increased its sales there to
105,200 from 80,500. Italy, Spain and Portugal were the most difficult
markets, with Renault suffering falls in sales and market share.
Renault is on the list of 21-publicly owned groups slated for privatisation
by the French government. The sale of the government's 79 per cent stake is
scheduled for this year, in spite of the failure of Renault's planned merger
with Volvo which was meant to take effect at the beginning of this month.

FT  08 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Time to put away their knitting needles - A
growing number of friendly societies are diversifying into new areas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is hard to think of a more unlikely bunch of revolutionaries than a group
which includes the Dentists Provident Society and the Metropolitan Police
Friendly Society.
Yet this week, by joining the growing number of friendly societies which are
using their ability to become incorporated to spread their wings and extend
the range of services they can offer, they are contributing to a movement
which has implications for the financial services sector more generally.
Altogether, 12 societies have taken advantage of the powers they acquired
under the Friendly Societies Act 1992 - 10 of them doing so this week.
In numerical terms they are only a fraction of the 450 or so extant
societies, but since they include the two largest, this group now accounts
for more than three quarters of the Pounds 6bn or so funds under management
by friendly societies.
Societies see the advantages of incorporation clearly. Previous legislation
tied them more closely to their origins in the co-operative movement and in
welfare provision than some thought necessary.
They were limited to selling long-term contracts, such as life assurance and
pensions policies, and also faced restrictions on the range of tax-exempt
investments they could offer.
The 1992 Act allowed them to incorporate and set up subsidiaries to carry
out a range of related activities, provided that the Friendly Societies
Commission, the regulator, agreed the plan, and the societies' members
approved the move.
The list of activities permitted after incorporation is a sign of how
diverse the sector is. Unit trusts and Peps, or general insurance are small
steps from the mainstream business carried on by the larger societies, but
moving into the administration of nursing homes or sheltered housing is a
more surprising possibility, even though some societies, such as the
Holloway Original, are already in this area.
So far, however, the main societies are looking to financial services.
Liverpool Victoria, which has Pounds 2.8bn under management, will offer
buildings and home contents insurance, and is planning to act as an agent
for mortgage business together with a building society.
Royal Liver Assurance, which has just over Pounds 1bn under management, is
also planning to enter the general insurance business.
Both societies, which collect their premiums door-to-door, see this, rather
than immediate access to more sophisticated savings arrangements, as what
their market wants.
In the longer-term, however, both see other opportunities, particularly in
the needs of individuals and their families as people retire earlier and
live longer.
'If I could pay something now to make sure my mother would never come and
live with me I probably would,' Ms Lindsay Firth McGurkin, head of marketing
at Liverpool Victoria, commented as she contemplated possible new areas of
business.
Others which have incorporated have a different approach. Family Assurance
Friendly Society was the first to make the move, last summer, and
immediately entered the Pep market.
The society, which has Pounds 717m under management, is a far cry from the
long-standing, collecting societies. It was set up in 1975 to market
tax-free savings, and sells products to its members through, for example,
independent financial advisers and through newspaper advertising and direct
mail.
Like the collecting societies, however, Mr Barry Chambers, Family
Assurance's marketing director, sees the future of the welfare state as
offering a significant opportunity. 'Friendly societies are united in making
sure the sector gets a share of the cake,' he said.
He added that the society would also be interested in moving into fund
management for charities and small pension funds and providing
administrative services to other societies.
These changes do not mean that the friendly society sector will immediately
change completely.
Many, often smaller, societies will still see incorporation as irrelevant.
Nor is there likely to be a stampede among those which do incorporate into
esoteric areas in which they lack previous experience.
Ms Marion Poole, general secretary of the National Conference of Friendly
Societies, described the societies as 'sensibly cautious'.
'Friendly societies are going to take their time, if only to avoid the
equivalent of buying a chain of estate agents just before the bottom falls
out of the property market,' she said.
For the longer term, however, the largest friendly societies have shown
their determination to adapt in order to survive. They will not simply, in a
much-used phrase, 'stick to their knitting', even if they are practising
their crochet before considering fancy embroidery.

FT  08 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Granada goes on the offensive in LWT bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Granada, the leisure and television group, last night went on the offensive
in its hostile takeover bid for London Weekend Television, now worth more
than Pounds 700m, with a new appeal to LWT share-holders.
In a letter to them, Mr Alex Bernstein, Granada's chairman, said the closing
price of 553 1/2 p for Granada's shares on Thursday valued each LWT share at
664p, a premium of 79p, or 14 per cent, to the LWT share price on the last
dealing day before the offer.
Granada's shares rose 26p to 579p yesterday, an increase that took the value
of the share deal past Pounds 700m.
Mr Bernstein warned in the letter: 'We believe that if you reject our offer
the current level of LWT's share price is unlikely to be sustained.'
The offer was extended for two weeks after the first closing date of
December 29 when Granada received acceptances covering 2.31 per cent of
LWT's equity to add to the 17.5 per cent it already held in the London ITV
company.
Investors were waiting for the Granada offer to be sweetened but the
pressure to make an improvement was reduced by the collapse of LWT's
takeover talks with Yorkshire-Tyne Tees.
The talks under which LWT would have taken over Yorkshire, and Anglia
Television would take over Tyne Tees, were scuppered earlier this week when
Anglia rejected the plan at a board meeting.
The Anglia rejection came despite proposals that would have meant Anglia
receiving a share of any combined profits from Yorkshire-Tyne Tees.
The proportion was to have been determined by the amount of money each
company put into the deal.
In his letter Mr Bernstein renewed the Granada claim that LWT, with only
'one business activity of any significance' had neither the size nor the
resources to take full advantage of new opportunities.
Granada pointed out that brokers were forecasting pre-tax profits for 1993
of between Pounds 35.5m and Pounds 37m for LWT.
'Even if the estimate of profit before tax for 1993 were some Pounds 45m,
implying earnings per share of 27.8p, you should ask yourself how
sustainable an increase of that magnitude would be', the Granada chairman
wrote.
LWT will publish its profit forecast next week but there are signs that the
company is preparing a surprise defence to try to keep its independence.
Meanwhile, the Office of Fair Trading has extended its investigation into
the deal.

FT  08 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Limit makes Pounds 22m increase in
commitments to Lloyd's
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London Insurance Market Investment Trust, the biggest of Lloyd's 21
corporate members, yesterday announced a Pounds 22m increase in its
commitments to the Lloyd's insurance market.
Limit has raised Pounds 280m from institutional and retail investors and
will provide backing for 101 syndicates managed by 33 managing agents and
will provide nearly a third of the Pounds 1.6bn in Lloyd's capacity supplied
by corporate capital.
The final allocation of Pounds 502.5m compares with Pounds 480.5m previously
agreed with managing agents when Limit, which was sponsored by Samuel
Montagu and James Capel, issued its listing particulars in November last
year.
The managing agents to which additional capacity has been allocated are
Wellington, Kiln, DP Mann, RGB, Spreckley Villers Burnhope and Venton. Limit
is supporting three syndicates not included in its listing particulars.
Two of these - 1038 and 1184 - were previously part of the Merrett Group,
whose Lloyd's underwriting interests were transferred to separate agencies
late last year. The third new syndicate, 1215, was created through the
recruitment of the underwriting team of 418, another Merrett syndicate.
Syndicate 1215, managed by Janson Green agency, may accept the reinsurance
to the close of syndicate 418's 1991, 1992 and 1993 pure underwriting years
but it will not assume responsibility for 418's underwriting liabilities in
respect of 1990 and prior years.
The agency most favoured by Limit is Murray Lawrence, nine of whose
syndicates have been allocated Pounds 50m of Limit's capacity. Other
agencies favoured by Limit include the Brockbank Group (Pounds 45m) and
Bankside Syndicates (Pounds 40m).

FT  08 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Yule Catto closes Dutch subsidiary
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yule Catto, the speciality chemicals and building products group, is to
close Nijs en Vale, its wholly owned Dutch subsidiary, later this year
following completion of its existing contracts.
Nijs en Vale, which makes architectural facades mainly in the Netherlands,
incurred estimated operating losses of Fl 2.7m (Pounds 900,000) and an early
return to profitability is not expected.
Closure costs are estimated at Fl 6.5m and about 70 jobs will be affected by
the decis-ion.
Yule Catto's 1993 results will make provision for Nijs en Vale's anticipated
losses and will also reflect a Pounds 1.4m charge in respect of goodwill
which arose on the acquisition and which had previously been set against
reserves.

CHC Helicopter Corp of Newfoundland has lifted its stake in Brintel
Holdings, the UK helicopter operator which was formerly part of Mr Robert
Maxwell's business empire, from 40 per cent to 90 per cent.
CHC has also acquired the outstanding 50 per cent of the preference shares
and plans to make an offer soon for the remaining ordinary shares, held by
the employees.
The shares were bought from institutions and Brintel's management.
The total cost, assuming the offer to Brintel's employees is accepted, will
be about CDollars 36m (Pounds 18m).
Brintel, based in Aberdeen, was formed a year ago to acquire the assets of
British International Helicopters from the administrator. In the 10 months
to November 30 1993 revenues were CDollars 75m for net profit of CDollars
8m.
It operates 25 heavy and medium helicopters servicing North Sea oil rigs. It
also provides simulator training for commercial and military helicopters,
and operates a shuttle service between Penzance, Cornwall, and the Scilly
Isles.

Hopes for improvements at Bryan Donkin Engineering and the Carborundum

future restructuring costs. A cost reduction programme was being implemented

FT  08 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Terence Chapman acquires Synergo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Terence Chapman Associates, a privately held management consultancy based in
the City, has come to the rescue of Synergo Technology, a small software
house financially damaged by the Stock Exchange Taurus fiasco.
It has paid an undisclosed sum for the nine-year old London-based software
house which supplies stockbroking, stock lending and settlement software
products to brokers and institutional investors.
A profitable company with 100 staff and revenue of Pounds 3.5m in 1992, it
was hard hit by the cancellation of Taurus, the Stock Exchange's proposed
automated settlement system, in which it had invested Pounds 1.8m. Despite a
respectable client list, the losses on Taurus left it with a severely
weakened balance sheet.
The acquisition is Terence Chapman's first. For 1992-93 it had turnover in
excess of Pounds 5m (Pounds 3.1m) and is planning to float within the next
five years.
Terence Chapman said its interest in Synergo lay in the company's expertise
in open and client-server systems. The two companies would operate
independently of each other under a group structure.

FT  08 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Trafalgar completes last stage of rescue
package
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Trafalgar House yesterday completed the final hurdle in its financial
restructuring when shareholders unanimously approved a proposed Pounds 425m
rights issue and placing of convertible preference shares.
Mr Simon Keswick, Trafalgar's new chairman, described the rights issue - the
company's second over a 10-month period - as providing a 'fresh start'.
Analysts agreed that it was a turning point in the fortunes of the troubled
conglomerate, and suggested that further capital raising would be
'unthinkable' within the next two years.
Shareholders were being asked to approve a 1-for-3 convertible preference
share issue, and a further Pounds 70m placement of convertibles aimed at
broadening the company's institutional shareholding base. The capital
raising represents a rescue package to offset exceptional write-downs of
Pounds 397m, which brought the valuations of the group's properties, hotels
and other investments down to realistic levels.
The acceptance of the rights issue represents a victory for 25 per cent
shareholder Hongkong Land, the cash rich property investment arm of the
colony's Jardine Matheson group.
Hongkong Land was the force behind the restructuring, which followed the
appointment of its finance director to the Trafalgar board. The Jardine
group has secured short-term credit lines for Trafalgar from HSBC Holdings,
which has historically-strong bonds with the 'princely hong'. In August its
control will be further demonstrated by the arrival of Mr Nigel Rich,
Jardine's 'taipan' - or managing director - as the new chief executive.

FT  08 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Pace of flotations continues as United
Carriers seeks listing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The frantic pace of the new issues market seemed barely to have skipped a
beat over the holidays as a parcels and freight distribution company
yesterday publicly announced its intention to float - just one week into the
new year.
United Carriers Group, which owns one of the main operators in the heavy
parcels and light freight sector within the UK's transport and distribution
industry, intends to seek a listing on the London Stock Exchange by way of a
placing likely to value the company at a maximum Pounds 50m.
The placing will raise between Pounds 5m and Pounds 10m of new money.
'We will use the cash raised from the listing to finance depots,' said Mr
Allan Binks, chairman, who with his three fellow board members expects to
become a millionaire as a result of the flotation. It is not yet clear what
stake the board will have after the flotation.
Mr Binks said the move would provide an exit for the 35 per cent stake held
by venture capitalists, led by Phildrew Ventures. They backed the management
in a Pounds 55m buy-out from Bunzl, now a paper and packing company but then
a conglomerate.
Bunzl had acquired the business, which then included an engineering arm, in
1985 for Pounds 95m. By 1988 the parcels side was incurring losses as fierce
price competition reigned in its overcrowded market.
Following the buy-out, the management team reorganised the parcels and
freight distribution business, adding further services in the same sector
and selling non-core operations.
Today, United Carriers operates from 34 depots nationwide with a staff of
more than 3,000. As well as business-to-business deliveries of larger
parcels, it provides several specialist distribution services.
The company offers Europe-wide distribution through the General Parcel
network, under which operators within 18 countries combine to form a
cross-border service.
Operating profits on continuing activities, before exceptional items, were
Pounds 4.5m in the year to December 1992. Turnover was Pounds 93m. Cash
inflow was Pounds 6m and borrowings were about Pounds 10m, against Pounds
24m of shareholders' funds.

<TEXT>
Two Scottish groups now control significant stakes in Ivory &amp; Sime, the
quoted Edinburgh-based fund management company, following the sale of Ensign
Trust's 16.7 per cent stake in the company.
Abtrust, the Aberdeen-based fund management group, has bought 2m shares in
Ivory &amp; Sime - amounting to a 6.9 per cent holding - on behalf of clients
which include unit trusts and investment trusts under Abtrust's management.
Scottish Value Trust, an Edinburgh-based investment trust, has bought 1.8m
shares, representing 6.3 per cent of the equity.
Ensign Trust, a company controlled by the Merchant Navy Officers Pension
Fund, sold its 4.8m shares in Ivory &amp; Sime after the fund manager lost
contracts to manage investment portfolios controlled by the pension fund.
Other purchasers of the Ensign Trust stake have not identified themselves.
The sale of the Ensign Trust stake leaves Sumitomo Life of Japan as the
biggest shareholder in Ivory &amp; Sime, with 15 per cent.

Profits of Williamson Tea Holdings rose from Pounds 4.23m to Pounds 6.15m
pre-tax for the six months to September 30. Turnover rose by Pounds 2.97m to
Pounds 20.7m.
Directors said the results should not be taken as a guide to the full year
because owing to its seasonal nature the tea crop is not harvested equally
throughout the 12 months.
Adverse climatic conditions reduced the Indian crop but there were
improvements in both Kenya and Tanzania.
Earnings emerged at 100.8p (74.33p) per share and the interim dividend is a
same-again 10p.
The company is ultimately owned by George Williamson Holdings.

FT  08 JAN 94 / Figures and fiction: UK TV groups face upheaval
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The day after Christmas, the BBC showed a feature film-length version of One
Foot in the Grave, its hit comedy about the curmudgeonly pensioner, Victor
Meldrew. The accident-prone grump pulled an audience of 20m for his One Foot
in the Algarve and helped to clinch a holiday ratings triumph for the
corporation. On Wednesday the BBC launches its most expensive costume drama,
the Pounds 6m six-part adaptation of George Eliot's novel, Middlemarch.
The contrast this week with the commercial ITV network could not be more
stark. There the talk is not of populist programmes and Victorian fiction,
but about the cut-and-thrust of multi-million corporate deals and the first
signs that newspaper groups, looking over their shoulders at media link-ups
in the US, might before long be allowed to own commercial broadcasting
companies in the UK.
Following the government's decision in November to allow one company to own
two ITV licences, a mould-breaking process of consolidation is under way.
This week a majority of Central shareholders accepted an agreed bid, worth
about Pounds 750m, by Carlton Communications, holder of the London weekday
licence. Meanwhile, London Weekend Television continued its struggle,
against apparently overwhelming odds, to avoid being swallowed up by
Granada, the leisure and television group, in a hostile bid worth about
Pounds 670m.
'ITV is undergoing fairly significant change and we will not fully
understand it before the end of the year, until the dust settles,' said Mr
Greg Dyke, chief executive of London Weekend Television.
This week LWT lost a significant round in its battle to stay independent.
The company confirmed that takeover talks with Yorkshire-Tyne Tees had
collapsed. Under the plan LWT would have taken over the Yorkshire Television
broadcasting licence and Anglia would have taken over Tyne Tees. As part of
the deal Anglia would have received a share of the combined earnings of the
overall Yorkshire-Tyne Tees group, based on the amount it invested in the
agreement. Even though Yorkshire was prepared to recommend the deal, the
Anglia board said 'no', leaving itself a takeover target.
LWT plans to continue with a defence based on its managerial record, backing
it up with the publication next week of a profit forecast that could top
Pounds 40m for 1993. City analysts nevertheless regard a Granada victory as
inevitable following the collapse of the Yorkshire talks.
Meanwhile, Lord Hollick, chief executive of MAI, the main shareholder in
Meridian Broadcasting, the south of England ITV company, is interested in an
agreed merger with Anglia but only at the right price. It is not clear that
he will pay the present one of 472p or that Anglia is planning to fall
quietly into his arms. But few in the industry believe Anglia is big enough
to remain independent in the longer term.
With a further relaxation of the ITV ownership rules possible, allowing
ownership of more than two licences before the end of this year, Carlton,
Granada and possibly MAI could emerge as the dominant players in the
network.
These chess moves gathered pace against the background of an announcement by
national heritage secretary Peter Brooke that the government plans a
comprehensive review of the UK's restrictive cross-media ownership rules. At
the moment newspaper publishers cannot own more than 20 per cent of a
commercial broadcaster in the UK.
The review was promised in November, when the ITV ownership rules were
liberalised. But the setting up of the review, bringing together officials
from National Heritage, the Department of Trade and Industry, the Treasury
and the 10 Downing Street Policy Unit is a sign that change is likely -
although to allow newspapers to own ITV companies would require legislation.
The government is trying to square a difficult circle - maintaining
diversity and choice for audiences while creating UK media organisations
large enough to play on the world stage.
The setting up of the review has pleased newspaper owners, several of whom
have been lobbying for months under the banner of the British Media Industry
Group for media ownership rules to be eased. The group brings together four
newspaper publishers: Associated Newspapers, publisher of the Daily Mail;
The Guardian Media Group; Pearson, owner of the Financial Times; and The
Telegraph, which wants to expand its television interests.
One option for examination is whether ownership of the media should be
treated like other industrial activities and regulated through existing
monopoly and mergers rules.
So far, the upheavals have been about purely UK domestic battles, even
though since January 1 the relaxation of ownership rules has made it easier
for European Union companies to take over ITV companies. So far the silence
has been deafening. If a continental invasion were ever to materialise, on
top of the existing turmoil, executives at the ITV companies might exclaim -
to use Victor Meldrew's catchphrase - 'I don't believe it'.

FT  08 JAN 94 / Victory elusive for rebels with a cause: The uprising in
southern Mexico marks a society mired in poverty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the main square of Ocosingo, a market town tucked in a mountain valley in
the southern Mexican state of Chiapas, the shooting sounded like fireworks
being set off to celebrate New Year. But when local people looked outside
they saw young men and women dressed in green with red scarves, wearing
balaclavas and brandishing machine guns.
Groups of guerrillas soon took over the modern town hall, killing four
policemen. Then they seized the radio station, the bank and other public
buildings. They broke open government stores and encouraged people to take
whatever they wanted.
Pierre Housin, a Parisian who had come to Ocosingo to see his daughter marry
a local businessman, said the rebels entered the hotels and told the town's
handful of tourists they were not at risk. 'At 7.30am I saw men in green
coming through the town with machine guns, and we were extremely worried.
But they weren't after foreign tourists and left us alone.' The men then
headed for the home of the town's wealthiest rancher, kidnapping him and his
family, ransacking the house. His son-in-law was still missing three days
later, but the rancher came back safely.
The rebellion in Ocosingo was repeated in two other towns in Chiapas and in
the colonial city of San Cristobal. It was the most violent uprising against
the Mexican state since the 1910 revolution which toppled the ruling
dictator. The fighters, members of the self-described Zapatista Army of
National Liberation, declared war against the government on behalf of the
country's 7m Indians.
Commander Marcos, the rebel leader who helped co-ordinate the attack on San
Cristobal, said it had been timed to coincide with the effective start of
the North American Free Trade Agreement. The insurgents were fighting for
democracy, land, food, housing, justice, they informed startled residents.
Speaking from the top floor balcony of the town hall, and wearing the
trademark green and red uniform, Commander Marcos told the crowd below that
he had taken over the town 'because there were no conditions for free and
democratic elections. In our declaration of war we call on the leaders of
the state to use their constitutional powers to depose the government of
President Carlos Salinas and his cabinet and in its place install a
transitional government.'
The words proved hollow. Three days after the uprising began, the rebels had
abandoned all the towns, leaving graffiti, burnt-out buildings and about 60
dead from clashes with the army. In Ocosingo some 30 were killed by army
forces, their bodies lying scattered in the market place which they had made
their headquarters. Six were lying face down with bullet holes in the back
of their heads.
Most of the guerrillas, up to 2,000 strong, were young Indians from small
villages in the surrounding hills and jungles. Many carried AK-47 machine
guns; others nothing more than wooden replicas. Some said they been training
for years, but others looked as if they had never carried a gun before.
The slick statements of their leaders seemed at odds with the inarticulate
explanations offered by the rank and file for the revolt. Along the road
from San Cristobal to Ocosingo, eight teenagers said they had never heard of
the free trade agreement. They said they had taken up arms to fight against
the poverty in which they live.
The group, one as young of 15, had lost its commander and had not eaten for
two days. 'We have nothing where we live, nothing to eat,' said the leader
in halting Spanish, as he clutched a radio with no battery. He said they
threw away their weapons as soon as they heard army rocket fire. They
thought they would continue to fight, but were not sure.
The insurgents come from Mexico's poorest state, which, with its large
Indian population and endemic poverty, is more akin to neighbouring
Guatemala than to the rest of Mexico. Indians have generally worked in large
farms belonging to landowners of Spanish descent or eked out a living from
the corn and beans they produce on small plots of land.
In recent years some 15,000 Indians from San Juan Chamula near San Cristobal
have been expelled from their land by caciques (local political bosses),
partly for embracing protestantism and also for becoming teetotallers, so
cutting the value of the caciques alcohol monopoly. Other Indians in the
jungle have lost land to loggers, the state oil company and cattle ranchers.
The abuse of their rights has long been criticised by the church.
Many residents of the region have been angered by the revolt, and
discrimination against an already oppressed minority may be stepped up as
the army and police search the area.
Outside Ocosingo, Elias Morales, a 30-year-old lorry driver, fled the town
with his lorry as soon as the fighting began. 'This is going to have a
terrible effect on commerce. Its going to make it difficult for us,' he
said. 'The rebels are people who do not want to work. They should defend
their rights peacefully. They have destroyed what we have built.'
Some people are more sympathetic to the plight of the peasants. Mr Jacindo
Arias, president of an organisation of Mayan and Zoques writers in Chiapas,
said: 'The situation of Indians has improved in some ways but they are now
demanding more. Modernisation and greater communication within the country
have made them more aware of their rights.' Indian groups throughout Mexico,
who have denounced the rebel action, have becoming increasingly organised in
recent years, following their counterparts elsewhere in Latin America.
As aircraft hovered over San Cristobal, firing rockets into the hills, the
government was trying to play down the significance of the revolt. Mr Eloy
Cantu, a senior official with the interior ministry, said peasants had been
manipulated by a group of violent extremists, probably trained abroad.
The political impact of the uprising is still unclear. The ruling
Institutional Revolutionary Party still remains the overwhelming favourite
to win this year's presidential election, but its candidate, Mr Luis Donaldo
Colosio, may come under some pressure to stress still further the social
aspects of his policies, and soften commitments to more economic change.
The more pressing challenge for the government will come in the weeks and
months ahead as the army seeks to root out the guerrillas who have returned
to their homes. The government is caught between wanting to capture those
involved as soon as possible and not wishing to alienate Indian villages
through excessive force, which would attract criticism from human rights
groups.
President Salinas said on Thursday that there would be full respect and
support for communities as action was taken against the rebels. But he also
warned that any further violence would lead to a political clampdown and
possibly to a curtailment of civil liberties. This could turn an isolated
uprising into something more widespread.
From Mr Arias came a note of warning. 'The rebellion is not a broad
indigenous movement, but if there is oppression, it could become one,' he
said. 'Indigenous peoples have to be given a voice in society.'

FT  08 JAN 94 / The price is right: UK car sales are rising on the back of
manufacturers' discounts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK has become a lonely, glittering prize for Europe's recession-battered
motor industry. Carmakers in continental Europe, surveying the wastelands of
their domestic markets, where sales fell last year by up to a quarter, are
casting covetous eyes at the one big market in Europe enjoying what now
looks like strong and sustainable growth.
New car registrations in the UK increased by 11.6 per cent last year - far
more than the industry dared to predict 12 months ago. Even pessimists in
the industry now expect sales to climb throughout the year.
But the explanation for the British revival is not a straightforward tale of
rising demand and suppliers rushing to catch up. Much of the sales growth
has been the result of consumers being wooed as never before by carmakers
seeking either to stem losses or hang on to profitability and to keep
production lines going. With few signs of market recovery on the Continent,
consumers can expect the wooing to go on.
The response of the consumer has caused some mayhem and not a little
heartache among the big carmaking rivals. Where traditionally many motorists
would stick with one manufacturer for a lifetime, they are now switching
between makers according to which is offering the best deal.
'Today's customer has become mobile, choosy - and totally disloyal,' says Mr
Alan Pulham, director of the National Franchised Dealers' Association.
The break up of customer loyalties is apparent in the Society of Motor
Manufacturers and Traders' figures. Sales in relatively new market niches,
particularly leisure four-wheel-drive vehicles such as Rover's Discovery and
'people carriers' like Renault's Espace, are still small but enjoying rapid
growth.
Most spectacularly, those manufacturers which have established reputations
for diesel models are enjoying a field day: diesel car sales last year
almost doubled to 340,000 and they now account for one in five of new cars
sold.
Mr Tom Purves, managing director of BMW (GB) says that the German executive
carmaker had expected to sell 1,200 of its new diesel 3 and 5 series cars
after their launch in the UK in the summer. 'We're past 1,800 and simply
can't get enough.'
In such niche markets sales have risen unaided but in the mainstream the
battle is being fought increasingly on price, with the biggest gains and
losses in terms of sales last year correlating closely to the size of the
discounts being offered.
Ford, once the market leader, is now struggling to maintain its
pre-eminence, trailing behind both Vauxhall and Rover in December's sales
figures. Last Spring, it cut the price of its new Mondeo saloon by an
average of 6 per cent only a fortnight after launch. Subsequently sales
revived.
At the same time, sales figures for last year have dispelled any suggestion
that, as Japanese makers Nissan, Toyota and Honda strengthened their
manufacturing capacity in the UK, they would push aside all other
competitors.
The Japanese manufacturers are enjoying healthy growth - but having to
invest as heavily in marketing as everyone else. Sales of Japanese models in
the UK rose by more than 15 per cent last year.
In common with other manufacturers, the Japanese companies are having to
fight much more strongly than they expected against some of the Continental
manufacturers who were expected to be among their early victims.
A rash of well-received and competitively priced new models, combined with
improved quality, successful marketing and generous offers on after-sales
service, has led to companies such as Fiat, Peugeot and Citroen enjoying
some of the best sales figures for any manufacturer last year.
Sales of Fiats, for instance, which had been falling in the UK since the
late 1980s, increased by 38 per cent last year. The company was helped in
particular by the introduction of the tiny, Polish-built Cinqueconto, which
set the pace for a new generation of urban runabouts and which virtually no
other European maker can yet rival.
The ferocity of the fighting for supremacy which waged throughout last year
 -and which can only intensify in the absence of any significant Continental
market upturn - has led some in the industry to question whether the
recovery is as strong as it appears.
In carefully-timed broadsides just before and during the London motor show
in October, Mr Pulham, whose NFDA members sell four-fifths of all new cars,
accused manufacturers of desperately trying to preserve market positions by
'forcing' the market.
He said dealers were being pressurised into registering cars for which there
were no final buyers in order to qualify for manufacturers' sales bonuses.
By intensifying the downward pressure on prices, he argued, the practice was
having an adverse effect on dealers, and because of the knock-on effects in
the second-hand market, ultimately on the motorists as well. According to Mr
Pulham, August alone saw at least 40,000 such cases.
Such attacks on the tactics of carmakers may be prompted partly by dealers'
self-interest. More than 2,000 dealerships have gone bust or changed hands
in the past two years of recession, as sales margins have been squeezed.
Meanwhile, the leading manufacturers are dismissive of the impact of their
attempts to increase sales, saying 'pre-registering' has been part of the UK
car market scene for years.
In addition, industry analysts such as Garel Rhys, professor of motor
industry economics at Cardiff Business School, estimate that the net effect
of pre-registration is probably only a slight over-statement of the new car
market's size. Year-on-year comparisons hold good and yesterday's statistics
are a fair reflection of the trend, he believes.
But another grievance of many dealers may prove of more significance: that
the interests of individual consumers are being threatened by the practices
of carmakers which sell direct to large fleet operators, bypassing the
dealer networks.
The NFDA says that such deals, which can involve discounts of 35 per cent or
more, now account for more than 300,000 car sales a year - nearly 20 per
cent of the total. As recently as the late 1980s, such deals were rare.
The figures highlight the enduring popularity of the company car, many of
which are now supplied from fleets, in spite of the progressive erosion in
the past decade of their tax advantages. The latest changes to the company
car tax regime, which come into effect on April 6, are expected to be
broadly neutral.
The NFDA maintains that the discounts offered to fleet buyers have to be
paid for somehow - and that small company buyers and private motorists are
subsidising them. New car list prices could be cut by 5 per cent if such
deals were outlawed, says the NFDA. But the association is not optimistic
that its call for such practices to be outlawed will be heeded.
Such disputes over practices, however, cannot disguise a new found
ebullience among both those who sell as well as make cars. This year, says
Mr Ernie Thompson, the former Ford director recently appointed chief
executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, sales should
rise further by nearly 100,000, to 1.86m.
'To put that into perspective, it is still 20 per cent down on the 1989
peak,' he says. But for many dealers, the fact that the British recession is
history will be enough.

FT  08 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Companies increasingly willing to
help promote training effort
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GRAHAM HOYLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, David Soskice's article, 'UK's wrong turning on training' (January 6),
outlined persuasively why British industrial employers have been
historically less committed and involved in vocational training than their
international competitors. That the UK is lagging behind is not disputed. He
concludes, however, that our employers will not, indeed cannot, change;
therefore the education system must continue to bail them out.
The UK cannot afford to adopt such a defeatist stance. I believe the growing
acceptance by companies large and small of the need to commit themselves to
being 'investors in people', systematically developing the skills and
potential of their workforces, demonstrates a potential change in industry's
approach to skill development. This is a long overdue and welcome revolution
that needs everyone's support.
The article also appears to suggest that the high-level vocational
qualifications that will be achieved through the proposed modern
apprenticeship will in some way be of lower value than traditional
educational qualifications. This is quite incorrect. Vocational
qualifications measure and accredit the application of knowledge learned -
knowledge often learned quite rightly at educational institutions. Indeed,
they are a natural development of the successful 'applied learning' courses
that were the hallmark of polytechnics in the 1970s and 1980s. We must move
away from the damaging either/or, or 'better than' debate. There is a need
to encourage everyone to achieve higher qualifications, vocational and
(so-called) academic. As such, the proposed modern apprenticeship offers
another route to which many will, for the first time, be prepared to say
'yes'.
Finally, the assertion that the UK needs organisational and computing,
rather than vocational, skills cannot be left unchallenged. The former are
vocational skills. The challenge is that both higher education offerings and
apprenticeships must deliver these with full employer support.

<TEXT>
Sir, Backing up R L Webb's letter (January 2) with regard to the proposed
Pounds 1m premium bond prize, I would go further and suggest that this sum
be divided into prizes of Pounds 1,000 each. Surely, like the thoughts of
Micawber, Pounds 1,000 for most equals happiness and Pounds 1m for a few
equal unhappiness all round.
And unless Ernie takes note of public opinion I intend to draw out my not
inconsiderable holding, which until recently attracted a regular prize of
Pounds 50, which encouraged me to buy more.

FT  08 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Correct representation of views on
local government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER CROWE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir I refer to Mr Philip G Yuill's letter (January 4) concerning local
government reorganisation. The Teesside and District Chamber of Commerce,
with some 1,100 member companies, has had a local government working group
with the Confederation of British Industry and the Teesside Small Business
Club for many years now, and has been consulting both its members and the
larger business community over this issue for some considerable time. Our
members range in size from the region's very largest companies to
one-man-bands. Representations made on their behalf are their own views and
are not made, as Mr Yuill states, by 'those who have a vested interest in
the debate'.
Mr Yuill refers to partnerships between the local councils and the private
sector. This chamber of commerce was invited by all our local councils to
assist them in developing their City Challenge bids and we have
representatives on both the boards and executive committees of Hartlepool,
Stockton-on-Tees and Middlesbrough City Challenge groups, as well as
specialist working groups.
The chamber movement, both on Teesside and nationally, has an excellent
record of partnerships with local government. My attendance at the launch of
the putative Tees Valley Development Company on a 'bitterly cold foggy
morning' (as Mr Yuill describes it), on behalf of the Teesside Chamber of
Commerce, is an indication that we will continue to work with local
government on economic development in our region, as we have been doing for
some 130 years.
We believe that, having consulted our members extensively, we have correctly
represented their views concerning the future of local government in the
region.

<TEXT>
Sir, In the introduction to his lively article, 'Find the dancers a home'
(January 1), Clement Crisp assumes the Arts Council has 'arranged' to scale
down London Contemporary Dance Theatre and increase the size of Rambert
Dance Company.
It is in fact the artistic directors of the Contemporary Dance Trust and
Rambert, not the Arts Council, who have determined the future direction and
size of each company. It is a pity that Mr Crisp's very cogent plea for the
establishment of a dance house is marred by factual inaccuracy and a limited
view of our diverse and innovative contemporary dance scene.

<TEXT>
Sir, At the conclusion of Andrew Hill's very relevant article ('Balloon
struggles to get airborne', January 5) on the single market and the need for
better enforcement towards the level playing field, he mentions the failure
to withdraw passport formalities across member state boundaries.
In my recent experience, this is getting worse, not better. For a simple
flight between the UK and continental Europe I have usually been obliged to
produce my passport on no less than three occasions: once at check-in, then
in passport control, and just before boarding the aircraft. We were surely
all told that the coming of the European Union would do away with this kind
of thing.
Is a new law to be enunciated? For all governmental actions (especially
those stated to have the reduction of bureaucracy as their objective)
greater bureaucracy will result.

FT  08 JAN 94 / Still chairman of the board / Assessing the security and
economic agenda Bill Clinton has set for his first trip to Europe as US
president
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This weekend Bill Clinton sets foot on European soil for the first time
since he became president 50 weeks ago. Before the year is out he is due to
return to the continent two or three more times. If 1993 was the year of the
domestic focus, with the foreign spotlight swivelling intermittently towards
distant trouble spots and more consistently towards Asia, then the 1994
stage seems to have been arranged to give Europe the opportunity to reclaim
what it has long considered its rightful place in the forefront of America's
external security considerations.
At least this is the hypothesis and it has been reflected in a torrent of
analysis in Washington this week, both by the administration and its
critics. If words were all, then Europeans could be excused for thinking
Warren Christopher, the secretary of state, never said, as he pungently did
last autumn, that one of the problems of US foreign policy is that it had
been too Eurocentric for too long.
Certainly the immediate Clinton mission is weighty. He will outline his
vision for Europe in a Brussels speech tomorrow night. The Nato summit will
debate the future shape and purpose of the alliance and the eventual
widening of its security net to countries to its east; and a session with
the European Union will discuss how best to extend economic benefits and
assistance.
In Prague, the president must explain to the leaders of Poland, Hungary and
the Czech and Slovak Republics why Nato's doors will not be immediately
opened to them. In Moscow he has the difficult task of telling President
Boris Yeltsin that resurgent Russian nationalism is neither conducive to
greater European security nor helpful to continued US leadership in
assisting the cause of Russian domestic reform. If Mr Yeltsin is in a
defensive mode, which would be understandable, then Mr Clinton will need to
be at his most creative and persuasive if he wants to avoid embarrassment.
In less tangible but equally important ways, Mr Clinton must also convince
the heads of the governments of Western Europe, whose recent individual and
collective leadership has been more conspicuous for its absence, that the US
will remain thoroughly engaged. It may be debated whether the US president
or his European counterparts are most to blame for any mutual lack of
confidence - he because he has been otherwise engaged and because of Bosnia,
and they because most would have preferred a second term for George Bush and
because one of their governing parties, the British Tories, worked against
Mr Clinton's election.
On the US side, there does appear to be a determination to put the western
European relationship on a better footing. Anthony Lake, the national
security adviser, claims there is little wrong with it, that his president
has met in Washington as many European leaders as did Mr Bush in his first
year and that, because diplomacy is not a zero sum game, the evolution of
what he calls the first coherent US Asian policy in decades means no
downgrading of the European priority.
The Uruguay Round agreement is held up as a model: the US and Europe burying
their hatchets for the common good and not into each other. Mr Lake often
refers to one of his own few public speeches, delivered last September under
the title From Containment to Enlargement and devoted to the proposition
that the 'core' democracies (the US, western Europe and Japan) have a
special obligation to work together for a more democratic and prosperous
world.
Western European diplomats based in Washington also generally take a more
relaxed view about the state of transatlantic relations than their head
offices back home apparently do. The British embassy, for example, is
particularly grateful for US support over the latest Northern Ireland
initiative and the French for being allowed to declare victory in the
Uruguay Round, though there have been some communications problems with
Germany over Somalia and Iran. UK diplomats are also pleased with the
pre-Nato consultations and are convinced the summit will go smoothly, in
spite of French attempts to give a higher profile to the latest
deterioration in Bosnia.
Still, it would be pointless to pretend that the general perception is all
of smooth sailing. Jim Hoagland's Washington Post column this week was
closer to the mark in its observation that 'what is missing is the
day-to-day sense of trust and clear private communications that guided the
Atlantic relationship through far more difficult times in the past'. The
reason for this at the highest levels may be obvious - Mr Clinton and his
European counterparts share few cold war experiences - but that does not
mean its absence makes life any easier.
The emphasis on economic security apart, the constant of Clinton's foreign
policy bearing most clearly on Europe is its devotion to the cause of reform
in Russia. The resurgence of Russian nationalism evident in last month's
elections and reflected in statements by Mr Yeltsin's government ever since
has led to something of a reappraisal, both of Nato's evolution and the
desired pace and extent of reform in Russia itself.
On Nato's development, an earlier, instinctive sympathy held by Mr
Christopher and Mr Lake to extending membership sooner rather than later to
Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic seems to have lost out to the
strongly held convictions of Strobe Talbott. The rising star of the Clinton
foreign policy team believes this would undermine Mr Yeltsin and boost the
nationalists.
This does, however, over-simplify a complex Washington policy debate.
Critical objections to making Nato instantly bigger were also advanced by
the US military, the alliance's most vital component. The Pentagon was not
only concerned with the complications of absorbing military forces of which
it knew too little, but also by the security implications of sharing
operational knowledge with countries whose political futures as
western-inclined democracies could not be assured (Hungary, for example).
The compromise, known as the 'Partnership for Peace', is based on creating
'habits of co-operation' that could make eventual membership less
troublesome.
On Russian reform, too, administration thinking has been fluid over the past
month. The initial lesson drawn by Vice-President Al Gore and Mr Talbott
after Russia's elections was that the country needed 'less shock and more
therapy'. That has now been amended. This week President Clinton spoke of
'more reform and more therapy, more attempts to build a safety net to deal
with the consequences of reform but not an attempt to slow down the reform
effort'.
In Washington political terms, this is a vindication of the approach of the
Treasury, specifically for Lloyd Bentsen, the secretary, and Larry Summers,
in charge of international affairs. On Monday Mr Summers said in Boston it
would be a 'grave mistake' to think there was some 'third way' for making
reform in Russia less painful.
As it is, the US ability to pour vast extra resources behind reform is
limited and Congress is unlikely to add to the Dollars 2.5bn in bilateral
assistance voted last year. The focus instead will be on disbursing money to
areas most in need, for which there should be leeway as only Dollars 3bn of
the Dollars 28bn G7 support programme agreed last year has been actually
delivered.
Both the plans for Nato and the reassessment of the approach to Russia have
stoked the fires of public debate. This is not only because eastern European
leaders such as presidents Lech Walesa and Vaclav Havel, both immensely
respected in the US, have been so critical (though this did prompt the
administration to send a team to eastern Europe, including General John
Shalikashvili, new chairman of the joints chiefs of staff, for some
smoothing of the presidential path).
A typical critique came from Robert Zoellick, undersecretary of state in the
Bush administration, who wrote this week that the problem with 'Partnership
for Peace' was its lack of substantive criteria for admitting new members to
Nato. 'We should aim to bring these democracies into Nato at about the same
time they enter the European Union,' in his view over the next three to six
years. The Washington Post and the Wall Street Journal this week broadly
agreed.
Brent Scowcroft and Richard Haass, respectively the head and a senior member
of the Bush national security council, thought, in a doom-laden column, US
foreign policy was approaching 'a point of peril'. They doubted a formal
expansion of Nato was necessary, but advocated a much tougher US line
towards Russia ('We have to make clear that our long-term support is not
unconditional and will depend on Russia's adherence to political and
economic reforms and restraint towards its neighbours') and less severe cuts
in US defence spending.
Mr Clinton's response has been careful, acknowledging US concerns about
Russian sensibilities. 'The signal that Yeltsin sent to me,' he said, 'is
that he did not want to feel that Russia was being isolated, was being moved
back into a sort of potential enemy status.'
Similarly, he hoped the 'limited' Nato approach to eastern Europe would work
'because we don't want them to feel threatened by an eastern pull any more,
but neither do we want to prejudge the future intentions and policies of
Russia and other countries in the newly independent states, especially
Ukraine'.
The overall goal for Europe, east and west, including Russia, should be the
emergence of a more integrated political and economic system, Mr Clinton
said. A good start in this direction was for the US 'to make as forceful an
argument as is possible that the Europeans ought to trade more with them'.
As an example, White House officials pointed out, the US has removed some
cold war statutes limiting trade with the eastern bloc, as promised to Mr
Yeltsin in Vancouver last year. Still under review is repeal of the
Jackson-Vanik amendment governing the granting of most favoured nation
trading status to Russia (it now receives an annual waiver).
Strobe Talbott said Mr Clinton would, in effect, be offering more European
countries 'shareholding' rights in the form of 'an arrangement and a
mechanism that will give all of the states . . . an important say in what
the post-cold war security order looks like'. By this yardstick, the US will
remain chairman of the board, but Bill Clinton's Year of Europe, starting
tomorrow, is predicated on the other executive directors pulling their
weight.

<TEXT>
A western pension fund manager with money invested in Karachi or Istanbul
would no doubt have been delighted this week to see that equities in both
markets hit all-time highs. The pleasure would, however, have been qualified
if the same manager held shares in Hong Kong, where on Thursday the stock
exchange registered its biggest one-day fall since the 1987 crash.
Depression would have set in with Malaysian equities, since the Kuala Lumpur
exchange simultaneously saw the biggest ever decline in a single day. Given
that such manic behaviour is the norm for emerging markets, any member of a
pension scheme might reasonably ask whether a claim on earnings and assets
in these developing economies is really going to do much for his or her
retirement income.
At a theoretical level, the answer is encouraging. One of the advantages of
the global equity market that has emerged since the liberalisation of
exchange controls in the 1980s is that it enables countries to seek
international solutions to a wider range of domestic economic problems. A
particularly difficult problem faced by most developed countries arises from
demography. Mature economies with ageing populations tend to generate excess
savings in relation to the available profitable investment opportunities.
This can lead to large current account surpluses, since the balance of
payments is the mirror image of the balance (or imbalance) of savings and
investment.
In an economy ring-fenced by exchange controls, pension fund money is
largely trapped. Meanwhile, excess saving puts a brake on growth unless its
deflationary impact is matched by dis-saving in the public sector. Yet
public sector dis-saving leads to an absurd situation in which first-world
countries run into the red on current account and have to suck capital out
of the third world to finance their deficits.
Ageing population
Take away the exchange controls and it becomes easy to export excess savings
in the form of equity capital to countries where populations are younger,
savings lower and investment opportunities greater. This is a positive sum
game, in which the contribution of western capital to economic growth in the
third world, and the resulting return to the first world, make it easier to
cope with the pressure of ageing populations. Meantime third-world countries
enjoy more flexible access to capital, in that equity dividends, unlike debt
interest, are not fixed.
The micro arguments for investment in emerging markets are equally strong.
Portfolio theory has established an overwhelming case that diversification
increases investment returns for a given degree of risk. Diversification
into emerging markets offers particularly big benefits because these markets
have a low correlation with international market movements. And there is a
big benefit to companies in the third world in the shape of a much reduced
cost of capital.
Practical limitations
This pleasing theoretical symmetry unfortunately has practical limitations.
For the complementarity of savings and investment patterns across the globe
is inadequately reflected in the structure of financial markets.
Underdeveloped capital markets in Asia, Latin America and elsewhere simply
cannot generate assets on a scale to match more than a tiny fraction of the
liabilities of the first-world financial system. Much third-world financing,
especially among the expatriate Chinese, is done through family contacts;
and oriental families are notoriously more keen to speculate in other
people's shares than to cede control of their own businesses.
Hence the fad that has sent prices sky-high over Christmas and the new year.
A wall of institutional money has collided with a very rickety emerging
market infrastructure. What has to be remembered is that such markets are
usually under-regulated and plagued by insider dealing. Equity shares may
confer no worthwhile voting rights and be subject to a variety of government
restrictions. Company disclosure can be threadbare and accounting haphazard.
Liquidity often proves illusory, which is why fund managers who think they
have the Midas touch in Karachi should think again. It was the foreigners
who propelled the market to its peak, and their judgment will look rather
different when they propel the market back to the depths on their way to the
exit.
Yet the caveats should not be overdone. Emerging markets may be as frothy as
a souffle, and as prone to fall. But Britain, the US and Japan started like
that too. The first rule of this high-risk game is that investors should
spread their risks and keep their exposure to a modest percentage of their
portfolio. The second is that they should avoid buying in a bubble, which is
where we are now. There are crashes aplenty in emerging markets and they
constitute that rare thing: a clearly identifiable buying signal. Wait for
the wailing and gnashing of teeth in those economies where longer-term
growth prospects look assured.

FT  08 JAN 94 / Woman in the News: Mistress of the 'mot juste' - A deputy
headteacher
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Every time she walks into her classroom at Summerhill School, a 900-strong
comprehensive in the West Midlands, Miss Nita Robbins is ready to do battle
 -not with her sometimes unruly pupils, but against the excesses of the UK
government's education policy.
As deputy headteacher, with the responsibility for implementing the national
curriculum at Summerhill, Miss Robbins, 52, has been in the front line. She
has had to make sure that the school is in line with the new curriculum - in
which the government laid out, in 1988, precisely what subjects should be
taught in the schools of England and Wales, and what each subject should
contain. This has brought unprecedented upheaval to classrooms: discipline
has been a casualty, as have 'non-core' subjects such as sociology and
business studies.
Now some of these changes will be put into reverse, following the
government's acceptance this week of the recommendations of Sir Ron Dearing
on reform of the education system. These will cut the time allotted to
curriculum teaching by 20 per cent for 11-14-year-olds and virtually abandon
it for 14-16-year-olds. Miss Robbins says wryly: 'At least this time the
changes should be workable.'
A French teacher, Miss Robbins has taught at Summerhill, at Kingswinford
near Dudley, for 29 years, during which time the area's traditional steel
industry has shrivelled. Most parents of her pupils are self-employed.
In spite of her struggles with the rigidities of the curriculum, she has
managed to raise standards over the past few years, with 60 per cent of
pupils last year gaining the equivalent of five old O-levels - well above
the national average and a notable achievement for a comprehensive in an
industrial area.
She says that, in spite of the difficulties of the past five years, she
still supports the national curriculum in principle. 'There were very
positive effects when the curriculum was introduced in that it gave the
provision of a basic entitlement (to be taught a core of information) to
each pupil. It has also tried to introduce some coherence and progression,
but as we now know from Sir Ron, it failed.'
Her first problem was that the curriculum was installed in fragments. She
circumvented much of this by starting a five-year plan on how the school
would phase in the curriculum.
Rules on science, English and mathematics came first, and these subjects
'tended to hog curriculum time'. Subsidiary subjects had to be squeezed in
when time could be found. Eventually the whole curriculum was fitted into
the school week, but only 'at the expense of the extra dimension of
enrichment which I felt we had before'.
An early casualty was a partly vocational GCSE in 'child development', which
had been popular with pupils interested in careers in nursing or social
services.
Then Miss Robbins and her staff had to find more space to add the elements
that they felt were educationally necessary. For example, a second modern
language was added, although the curriculum only requires one, because they
felt it was important for the children to have a choice. Fitting both German
and French into the timetable meant giving lessons in each language for only
three periods each week, putting pressure on both teachers and pupils.
Another adroit manoeuvre to make the curriculum work involved splitting the
mandatory sex education between biology and religious education. 'We saw it
as a moral issue as well as biological one.'
Now that Sir Ron has freed one day a week to be filled at schools'
discretion, Summerhill may reintroduce its old 'extra dimension' subjects.
First, Miss Robbins must decide what to offer children older than 14, who
will now be covered only by a minimal curriculum, and then sort out the less
flexible timetable for children in the first three years of the school.
'My main job now is to take the fear out of the change,' she says. 'I have
already had the heads of science and technology coming in to see what it
means for them.'
Miss Robbins also has to soothe the unions. Some may still boycott this
year's tests, which are included in the Dearing package. No tests took place
at Summerhill last year. 'The tests didn't accurately or adequately monitor
or assess what was in the curriculum. They simply were not credible.' She
has not seen this year's tests, and is awaiting the unions' next move.
'Teachers' experience of the tests so far has not been a good one.'
She is happy, however, with one government guideline: education secretary Mr
John Patten's call this week that parents take greater responsibility for
their children's behaviour in school. This is vital if Summerhill is to
reduce the number of pupils it suspends from school, in line with Mr
Patten's wishes. 'The reason we're excluding more pupils is because there
are fewer sanctions we can use. We use detentions but sometimes parents
refuse to let their child stay in.'
She agrees with Mr Patten that the cane is 'a dead issue' as a disciplinary
aid. It has not been used at Summerhill for more than a decade, and was only
used at most about three times a term. The school has only ever expelled one
pupil, after three years of disobedience, and the maximum exclusion time
from school is now three days, imposed for serious offences such as swearing
at teachers.
After managing Summerhill through the first three years of the national
curriculum, Miss Robbins made further use of her experience in a nine-month
secondment to industry. She helped IBM, the computer company, run courses,
including on managing change.
Back at Summerhill, caught between a government that still lays down what
most pupils should be taught for 80 per cent of the time and the demoralised
workforce that must teach the curriculum, Miss Robbins, and thousands of
heads and deputies like her, now face a task as difficult as running any
large corporation. She does not intend to shirk it.
'With each child we must remember at all times that they will have only one
bite of the cherry at their education. We need to get it right.'

FT  08 JAN 94 / Rothschild man to head Panel: Takeover chief opposes EU
plans for a statutory regime
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr William Staple, a director of the investment bank NM Rothschild, is to be
director-general of the Takeover Panel. He will replace Ms Frances Heaton on
March 2.
Mr Staple is the brother of Mr George Staple, the director of the Serious
Fraud Office. 'We will not be discussing City matters at family gatherings,'
Mr William Staple said. He added: 'I would hope that matters which come
before the Takeover Panel do not later concern the SFO.'
His appointment, which is for a two-year secondment, has been made by the
panel's chairman Sir David Calcutt QC, with the approval of the Bank of
England.
The panel is a non-statutory body which for 25 years has set the rules that
public companies and their advisers must follow in acquisitions.
Mr Staple said he believed the threat of a statutory regime for takeovers
was the most significant issue facing the panel.
The European Commission, noting the success of the UK system, has proposed
that all countries adopt legislation establishing similar rules in an effort
to ease the way for cross-border merger and acquisition activity. The UK
government is fighting the proposals, arguing that a statutory regime would
invite the threat of judicial review for panel rulings.
However, Mr Staple, echoing the views of Sir David, said: 'I would want very
much to resist a statutory system. People would be tempted to take their
takeover decisions to the courts and the ensuing delays would greatly
increase the costs of acquisitions.'
He said that a statutory, and therefore more time-consuming system, would
reduce the speed of the panel.
The current structure, he said, had led to a consistent application of
general rules such as the requirement that all shareholders be treated
equally and that those acquiring more than 30 per cent of a company's shares
be required to bid for all of them.
Given the economic recovery, Mr Staple said, it was likely that his tenure
at the panel would see another spurt of takeover activity, and it was
possible some rules would be changed. 'We will need to constantly review the
rulebook in light of changing market practice and the cases which come
before us,' he said.

FT  08 JAN 94 / Mortgage lending shows autumn dip
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Net mortgage lending in November fell back to Pounds 1.65bn from Pounds
1.88bn in October, figures from the Bank of England showed yesterday. The
statistics, however, still show a pick-up in lending from the first half of
1993, when the monthly figures averaged Pounds 1.2bn.
Mr Adrian Coles, director-general of the Council of Mortgage Lenders, which
represents building societies and centralised lenders such as banks, said
the figures showed that mortgage lending remained robust.
In terms of net lending, building societies continued to lose market share
to banks. The seasonally adjusted figures in November stood at just less
than Pounds 1.1bn for banks and Pounds 600m for societies.
The number and amount of new loans approved, however, showed the building
societies picking up a larger share than the banks. Overall, loans approved
in November were Pounds 4.7bn, up from Pounds 4.3bn in October, with
building societies claiming Pounds 3bn.
Mr Coles said the overall rise in level of loans approved, confirmed the
council's view that the housing-market recovery could be expected to
strengthen during 1994.
Bank and building society lending is a key component of M4, the broadest
indicator used by the government to measure the money supply.
Final figures for M4, published yesterday, showed seasonally adjusted growth
of 4.9 per cent between November 1992 and November 1993. Such an annual
increase is towards the bottom of the government's 3 per cent to 9 per cent
monitoring range. However, growth in M4 has picked up recently; the
annualised growth rate in the three months to November was 7.1 per cent.
Meanwhile, the shorter leading index, published yesterday by the Central
Statistical Office, confirmed evidence of economic recovery by rising 0.7
per cent in the month to November.
The index is designed to pinpoint turning points in economic activity five
months in advance. November's rise, based on only three of the five index
constituents, was caused largely by the strength in share prices.

FT  08 JAN 94 / Outlook brightens for Maxwell pensioners: The quest to
replace lost fund assets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bank of America's surprise announcement earlier this week that it would pay
Pounds 25m to the Mirror Group Newspapers pension scheme is the first good
news in months for some 20,000 pensioners.
It has raised hopes that financial institutions, professional advisers and
insurance companies, all of which had dealings with Robert Maxwell, may be
preparing to make significant contributions to the pension schemes that were
depleted in the Maxwell era.
'I think 1994 is going to be a good year for us,' said an adviser to one
former Maxwell company pension scheme whose members are still seeking nearly
half their assets. Trustees and advisers to the schemes point to two factors
which have made them more hopeful than at any time since more than Pounds
440m was discovered missing in December 1991.
First, the efforts of Sir Peter Webster, the former High Court judge
appointed to help find a 'global solution', are said to be quietly making
progress.
Sir Peter is said to have met with all the banks and financial institutions
holding assets which are also claimed by the pension schemes.
'One problem has been that some banks wanted not just a global solution but
an inter-galactic solution,' said one adviser to the pension schemes.
In short, they had hoped that a payment to the pension scheme would cause
all claims against them from shareholders or other parts of the Maxwell
empire to be dropped. Since last autumn, Sir Peter is said to have persuaded
them that the inter-galactic solution is not practicable.
But the chief difficulty he has encountered was predictable. According to
sources familiar with the talks, each bank wishes to minimise the amount of
cash it must ultimately return to the pensioners.
For many assets there are several possible financial institutions from which
the schemes could demand restitution, so each bank has been reluctant even
to discuss how much it is prepared to concede lest it let one of its
competitors off the hook.
Sir Peter has managed to persuade the reluctant banks that any conversation
he has is confidential. One scheme adviser said: 'He sends you a note
inviting you to ring for an appointment to see him. It's all very informal.'
He is so concerned about confidentiality that notes of each meeting refer
only to the individuals and their bank in a code 'so that if the notes fall
into the wrong hands, no one will understand them', one adviser explained.
Also, Sir Peter has apparently been willing to think broadly about solutions
for financing the Maxwell pensioners, and is not insisting that each
institution simply pay a single lump sum into the pot.
Insurance companies which provided director's liability policies, now
refusing to pay hundreds of millions of pounds in claims, have been told it
may be possible for them to spread their contributions over a long period
because pension liabilities will come due over a period perhaps as long as
the next 20 to 40 years.
Sir Peter is said to be working to a timetable which contemplates completion
of an agreement by the middle of next summer.
Another significant new factor is a recent High Court judgment. At face
value, the case was a victory for the defendants, Lehman Brothers, the
investment bank, Credit Suisse, Swiss Volksbank and Morgan Stanley, who were
being challenged by Macmillan over the ownership of shares in Berlitz
International.
Although Macmillan lost the case, in a 31-page summary Mr Justice Millett
said it might have won against Lehman Brothers in particular had its lawyers
argued that Lehman Brothers knew or ought to have known that the Berlitz
shares in question belonged to pension fund trustees; that stock borrowing
activities which Lehman was party to were inappropriate for a pension fund;
and that Lehman should never have taken possession of the shares in the
first place.
In a series of writs filed against Lehman Brothers and others, trustees for
the pension schemes are making precisely the argument that Mr Justice
Millett concluded might have succeeded in court.
In a 158-page writ served last autumn, liquidators to the Maxwell-controlled
fund manager Bishopsgate Investment Management detailed conversations and
correspondence over a two-year period which aim to demonstrate precisely
that point.
For its part, Lehman Brothers says it believes it has a strong case and that
it is prepared to go to court. However, the investment bank said it had
spoken to Sir Peter and would consider some sort of global solution in an
effort to rid itself of a lengthy, expensive and embarrassing legal battle.

FT  08 JAN 94 / Life industry wins respite on disclosure rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Life assurance customers are unlikely to get better information from all
sales agents until the start of next year, the Securities and Investments
Board said yesterday.
SIB, the City's chief regulator, has published proposals which will become
effective from July 1 this year.
Agents will have to disclose sales commission on life products and tell
customers more about the disadvantages they would suffer if they surrendered
a long-term investment early.
While a few companies are expected to implement the changes from the start
of the new regime, the life industry has been given six months, until the
beginning of 1995, to make the transition.
Legal &amp; General, one of the largest life offices, said it did not expect to
be able to begin the regime until the start of next year, and there is a
strong feeling in the industry that many life products will not be sold
under the new rules until the last possible date.
One estimate puts the cost to the industry of changing computer systems to
meet the new requirements at up to Pounds 100m.
SIB was told by the Treasury last July to produce regulations requiring
disclosure a year after the Office of Fair Trading had said that SIB rules
were anti-competitive.
Under SIB's new proposals - an earlier version of which was published last
November for consultation - sales agents and advisers must automatically
give customers written information about commissions in terms of cash before
the customer signs a proposal form for any life product.
Regulators are to discuss further with the industry how to calculate the
cash figures that should be disclosed as commission. The aim is to give the
potential investor a clear and fair picture of the arrangements through a
range of different distribution channels. There is great sensitivity about
how the amount disclosed to the prospective buyer reflects the full
commercial cost of assistance and services provided to company
representatives which independent advisers would have to pay for themselves.
They include the costs of administrative support, computer systems and
accommodation.
Further work is being done on the paper which tells the customer more about
the product and which is to be handed over by the sales agent at the outset
of a sale.
The industry has consistently and vigorously opposed commission disclosure,
and even among some regulators there is a feeling that the issue has grown
out of proportion.
Mr Andrew Large, SIB chairman, emphasised that the new disclosure regime was
only one element in bringing about improvements in selling financial
services. He highlighted the setting up of the Personal Investment Authority
and new training and competence provisions.

FT  08 JAN 94 / Canals board 'can still do better'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The British Waterways Board, which runs Britain's canals, has become much
more commercially minded but could still do better, the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission said yesterday.
In its second report on the board in seven years, the commission commended
it for taking a more dynamic and businesslike approach to its work; it was
better at planning, introducing standards, and computerising its operations.
But the commission made 48 recommendations for improvement, including cost
control and more active marketing of leisure facilities.
Mr Neil Hamilton, the corporate affairs minister, said: 'BWB has changed
from a centralised organisation orientated towards administering a grant to
one developing a strong commercial outlook, and the MMC commends the BWB and
its staff for the work they are doing.
'Nevertheless, the MMC finds that BWB could continue to improve its
efficiency and the quality of its services, and expects BWB to be able to
generate higher net revenue.'
The board said it would take account of the commission's recommendations to
provide continued improvements to the waterways.

FT  08 JAN 94 / Equal pay victory for 1,500 women
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The largest group of women to win an equal pay case in Britain were
yesterday celebrating pay rises of between 37 per cent and 74 per cent.
1,500 women welfare assistants in West Sussex schools were awarded pay
parity with council van drivers by a Southampton industrial tribunal in a
case concerning equal pay for work of equal value submitted four years ago.
Mr Phil Wood, the local representative of Unison, the public service union,
said the basic increase on the annual pay bill of West Sussex county council
would be Pounds 1.2m but that could rise to Pounds 2.3m as women moved up
seniority scales.
Most women will see their hourly rate increase from Pounds 2.94 to Pounds
4.04 but that could rise to Pounds 5.13 with seniority. Mr Wood said: 'The
settlement will give confidence and encouragement to women in all walks of
life to fight for a better pay deal. It is also a clear signal to all
employers that Unison and other unions are working hard to ensure that women
are treated equally.' The case, brought on behalf of four welfare
assistants, has cost the union Pounds 100,000.
Equal pay cases have been dogged by length and cost. Only about 25 cases
have been completed successfully in the past 10 years. The Equal
Opportunities Commission recently opened discussions with the government
about making legislation work better. It has also threatened to take the
government to the European Court of Justice if it does not amend the laws to
make them easier to apply.

FT  08 JAN 94 / Scott blames Whitehall for inquiry delays
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lord Justice Scott has told the government that continuing delays in
obtaining Whitehall documents have disrupted the progress of his
arms-for-Iraq inquiry.
In a letter to Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, the
judge confirms the inquiry has been delayed and sets a provisional date of
July for the completion of a first draft of his report.
While thanking the minister for the co-operation generally shown by
Whitehall, Lord Justice Scott states: 'I regret to say . . . that there have
been a number of occasions when documents have been submitted long after
they should have been.'
The letter continues: 'This inevitably disrupts the orderly conduct of
business.'
Lord Justice Scott says in the letter that his inquiry has 'raised important
questions about the relationship between ministers and parliament and
between civil servants and their ministers'.
An inquiry official said last night that there was no suggestion that the
government was deliberately trying to withhold information. 'We have found
that some of the documents we have asked for have been misfiled, or come to
light after further inquiries,' he said.
The delay means that the contents of the Scott report will not be known
until after elections for councils and the European parliament. The letter,
sent on December 21, was released yesterday by the judge with a reply dated
January 5 from Mr Richard Needham, trade minister, in the absence of Mr
Heseltine, who has been on holiday.
In his reply, Mr Needham reiterates earlier assurances made by Mr John
Major, the prime minister, that the government will 'continue to do all that
we can to assist' the judge in his inquiry.
The inquiry will resume public hearings next week with the appearance as
witnesses of Mr Kenneth Baker, the former home secretary, and Lord Howe, the
former foreign secretary. Critics of the inquiry in recent months have
suggested that the exercise was proving an unnecessary waste of government
money.
But the inquiry's sponsoring department, the Department of Trade and
Industry, last night released figures which officials described as
confirming 'reasonable expenditure'.
The inquiry costs to the DTI since November 1992 are officially put at
Pounds 610,000. It is being covered by the DTI's overall budget for
miscellaneous running costs in the year 1993-94 of Pounds 329m.

FT  08 JAN 94 / Authority acts over foetal eggs row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority yesterday said its members
had overcome the initial 'yuk factor' they felt over using eggs from aborted
foetuses to treat infertility and were now keeping an open mind.
The HFEA - the government body set up in 1991 to regulate 'test-tube baby'
clinics - rushed out a consultation document in response to widespread
concern about research which could lead to foetal eggs being used to treat
infertile women within three years.
Sir Colin Campbell, HFEA chairman, said yesterday that members of the
authority had reacted with 'unease, distaste and surprise' when they first
heard about the technique. But this emotional response to the 'Yuk factor'
had passed, he said.
The document itself acknowledges that the public 'may feel an initial
repugnance' to using aborted foetuses to help women whose own eggs are
defective in some way. But it says the authority has an open mind and is
looking forward to hearing people's views on the issue.
Scientists at Edinburgh University, led by Dr Roger Gosden, have shown that
the technique works with animals. It involves removing ovaries from a
foetus, 'maturing' the eggs in the laboratory, fertilising them with sperm
and then implanting the resulting embryos into the womb.
Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, said it would not be permissible
to use human foetal ovaries under present legislation, and Dr Gosden has
stopped the research programme until the HFEA has issued new guidelines.
These are not expected before the autumn.
There is currently a severe shortage of donated eggs available for
implantation into infertile women, who typically wait between three and five
years for treatment in one of Britain's 63 fertility clinics.

FT  08 JAN 94 / Short Brothers to shed 429 jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Belfast Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Short Brothers, the Belfast aircraft and missiles manufacturer, announced
yesterday it was shedding 429 jobs after a review of manpower, Our Belfast
Correspondent writes.
The company blames the redundancies on continuing financial problems in the
industry and cuts in defence spending worldwide.
Taken together, these trends have led to significant reductions in the
aircraft, aircraft engine and defence programmes of many of Shorts' biggest
customers.
Shorts regretted the impact of the cuts on its workforce but was optimistic
about job prospects for 1994.
The company, which is part of the Canadian transportation group Bombardier,
is Ulster's largest private employer, with just under 8,000 workers.

FT  08 JAN 94 / South is given 133 flood warnings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The National Rivers Authority has issued 133 flood warnings, including four
red warnings - used when flood barriers are in danger of being breached -
for areas in the south of England at high risk of serious property damage.
The areas at most risk are:
Salisbury on the river Avon.
Chichester on the river Lavant.
Aldershot on the river Blackwater.
Newport Pagnall on the river Ouse.
Mrs Gillian Shephard, the agriculture minister, said yesterday the
government would not compensate farmers and individuals suffering losses due
to flooding.
She said on BBC Radio: 'We don't have provision to compensate farmers or
indeed individuals, and quite a lot of farmers do insure against severe
weather conditions.'
The National Farmers Union was surprised that Mrs Shephard ruled out
compensation before the NFU had even formally requested government aid. It
said that, although individual farmers had suffered serious losses, the
flooding had not amounted to a 'national disaster' for farmers.
Mr James Wiseman, group secretary for the Chichester branch of the NFU, said
that most of the damage had been to crops and fields - which cannot be
insured.
The Association of British Insurers estimated that flooding over the past
two weeks had caused damage of Pounds 30m-Pounds 60m. The storms of January
1990 caused Pounds 2.1bn of damage.
High flood waters yesterday disrupted three British Rail lines in the
south-west. Buses were in use between Didcot and Swindon on the route to
Bristol and Wales, and on the Barnstaple to Exeter and Liskeard to Looe
lines.

FT  08 JAN 94 / Unionist MPs face grassroots backlash: James Molyneaux has a
tricky task in maintaining unity in his party
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr James Molyneaux, the Ulster Unionist party leader, will today conduct the
last of three private meetings of party activists in an exercise that will
gauge the strength of grassroots backing for the party's guarded support for
the Downing Street declaration.
The continued backing of Northern Ireland's largest political party for the
declaration is vital to the UK-Irish peace initiative's prospects of
success.
The declaration, of December 15 last year, entrenched the majority unionist
veto over constitutional change in Northern Ireland but balanced it with
explicit recognition of the possibility of a united Ireland.
Senior officials admit that initial reaction to the declaration was
negative. 'At first the phone calls we were getting here were talking about
sell-outs,' says Mr William Bell, a UUP councillor in Lisburn.
But they say this mood changed once people started to study the document in
detail. 'Over Christmas the whole tone of the telephone messages changed to
one of support for the parliamentary party,' says Mr Jim Wilson, UUP general
secretary.
Yet not everyone is happy, and it is clear that the leadership will not
escape without criticism from this week's meetings. Mr Jim Clarke, a UUP
councillor in Belfast, plans to use tomorrow's gathering to urge the party
to withdraw its support for the declaration because it 'gives no alternative
to Ireland's problems but a united Ireland'.
Mr Clarke, who broke party ranks to support a motion condemning the
declaration when it was debated this week by Belfast City Council, argues
that Mr Molyneaux was 'too hasty' in welcoming the document. 'Jim Molyneaux
has not got a mandate from the people to accept this,' Mr Clarke says.
Mr Raymond Ferguson, a UUP councillor in Enniskillen, says the meetings will
reveal deep discontent in the party.
'People in the unionist community here are sore and angry,' he says. 'I am
sure that the meetings . . . will be used by them to make it clear that they
are not at all happy with what the UUP Westminster MPs are agreeing to in
this declaration.'
Another prominent UUP councillor says there is 'widespread opposition' to
the document in the party. 'My phone and mail bag has been dreadful with
people complaining about it . . . We feel that Molyneaux is being sucked in
 -pulled along by Major because of Major's small parliamentary majority,'
the councillor says.
Senior officials expect that during the meetings Mr Molyneaux will discuss
the advice he gave privately to Mr Major before the declaration.
The leadership's hand has been strengthened by Westminster's decision to
approve the establishment of a Northern Ireland select committee, a
long-cherished unionist aim, symbolising the province's integration with the
UK.
But Mr Molyneaux must still tread cautiously. The slightest sign that the
so-called loyalist veto over any change in the province's constitutional
status might be undermined could send support cascading to the Rev Ian
Paisley's hardline Democratic Unionist party before the European elections
later this year.
The UUP leader's priority appears to be to encourage progress in the talks
process being pursued under the stewardship of Mr Michael Ancram, the
Northern Ireland minister.

FT  08 JAN 94 / 11% rise in car sales surprises dealers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The strength of recovery in the UK new-car market last year took dealers and
manufacturers by surprise and has produced forecasts of further sales rises
during 1994.
Figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders yesterday showed
new car registrations rose by 11.6 per cent in 1993, to 1,778,426 from
1,593,601 in the whole of 1992, despite a downward blip in December.
However, last month's 7.73 per cent drop compared with the previous December
was technical - the result of an artificial boost to registrations in 1992
caused by a rush to register remaining cars without catalytic converters
before a December 31 deadline.
Mr Ernie Thompson, the SMMT's new chief executive, yesterday welcomed the
figures. He said: 'We expect a modest recovery to continue in 1994 for which
we are currently predicting sales of around 1.86m.'
The Retail Motor Industry Federation, representing the bulk of the UK's
retail motor trade, is predicting a further increase of 100,000 sales - to
1.88m - this year. However it warned that last year's growth was partly the
result of intense marketing activity which had done little for
profitability. It fears that a similar situation will prevail this year as
continental European manufacturers intensify their UK sales efforts to
compensate for slumping demand in their domestic markets.
Even if the forecasts are realised, sales will still be well short of the
record of 2.3m, set in 1989.
Statistics for the commercial vehicles sector, also released yesterday,
reinforce the RMI's warning on marketing activity. Sales of vans, trucks and
buses, bought strictly on the basis of business need, were much less
buoyant. They finished the year down 2.05 per cent at 197,067, from 201,186.
Ford retained its crown as market leader last year with 21.46 per cent, but
its principal rival Vauxhall narrowed the gap at 17.09 per cent.
In December, Ford's share of 17.16 per cent left it trailing not just behind
Vauxhall's 17.47 per cent for the second time last year but also  - for the
first time - behind Rover. Some of the biggest 'winners' last year were
continental European manufacturers, some of whom outperformed Japanese
rivals. Fiat, Renault and the Peugeot group, including Citroen, increased
sales by around one-third. Peugeot, which took a record 8.02 per cent, has
now increased its UK market share for the 10th year in succession. Imports'
share of the market rose marginally to 55.51 per cent from 54.93.

FT  08 JAN 94 / Parent's Charter to go to 20m homes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government will deliver copies of a revised Parent's Charter to 20m
households next month at a cost of about Pounds 2m, Mr John Patten, the
education secretary, said yesterday.
The duties of schools and responsibilities of parents will be set out in the
document which is part of the Citizen's Charter initiative.
In response to claims that this would be wastefully expensive, Mr Patten
said distributing door-to-door was the cheapest method for the taxpayer and
ensured that all parents and 'others concerned about education' would be
fully informed.
Mr Patten said the move reflected the interest which Mr John Major, the
prime minister, had taken in education and likened Mr Major to Mr George
Bush, the former US president, who said he wanted to be an 'education
president'.
He said: 'John Major has a target of becoming an education prime minister.
That's why when he talks about the back-to-basics message he talks about
education.'
Mr Patten refused to commit himself to a response to the call by the
National Union of Teachers, made on Thursday, for this year's National
Curriculum tests to be abandoned. He said the NUT had made no suggestion
that it would stop teaching the National Curriculum before the tests and he
questioned the union's motivation for wishing to abandon them.
However he said he would consider the matter further before making a formal
response.
He said he would not deviate from the government's response to Sir Ron
Dearing's report on the curriculum, published on Wednesday, which said tests
should take place in mathematics, English and science this year.

FT  08 JAN 94 / Exchange breaks eight records
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Eight records for capital raising, trading markets and indices were set on
the London Stock Exchange in 1993.
The exchange said that after record turnover in November, December was the
second-busiest month ever, with business in London's domestic and
international equity markets together totalling Pounds 109.38bn.
The FT-SE-A All-Share Index reached a record high of 1698.75 on December 29,
while the FT-SE 100 Index reached its historical peak on the same day at
3462.0.
In 1993 a record 180 UK companies achieved exchange listings, up from the
previous high of 155 set in 1987.
Total equity turnover of Pounds 1,143.5bn was up 34.5 per cent from the
previous record of 1992. Cash raised from UK equity rights issues was a
record Pounds 11.38bn, up 12.3 per cent from the record set in 1991.
The exchange said monthly turnover in UK equities had been the highest since
July 1987 at Pounds 55.8bn, mostly reflecting investor enthusiasm following
chancellor Mr Kenneth Clarke's Budget statement.
Business in overseas equities reached Pounds 53.6bn, the fourth-highest
ever, after the successful conclusion of the Uruguay round of Gatt trade
talks.

FT  08 JAN 94 / Turbulent activists worry Tories
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Senior Tories are becoming increasingly worried about the display of 'people
power' which forced Mr Tim Yeo to resign as environment minister after an
extra-marital affair which produced a child.
The fear is that the campaign by Suffolk party members to force Mr Yeo to
quit will lead to pressure for a bigger role for constituency activists.
This has long been resisted by the party leadership, which has sought to
maintain tight central control.
Close associates of Sir Norman Fowler, party chairman, believe that the
Suffolk outburst was prompted by personal animosity between Mr Yeo and local
party officials.
But influential backbenchers say the affair has set an important precedent
because no other Tory minister has been forced to resign by constituency
pressure. 'This raises all kinds of complex questions about who is
responsible for what in the party,' said one senior MP.
There was also concern that more powerful constituency associations could be
targets for extremist groups. These have occasionally infiltrated local
party organisations in the past. A backbencher said: 'If we are going to be
dependent on individuals, then who knows what groups will try to take
control of constituency associations to influence ministers?'
The activists' success was applauded by Mr Eric Chalker, a member of the
Charter Movement, which campaigns for greater democracy in the Tory party.
He said: 'The desire of party members to assert themselves is steadily
growing.'
But the South Suffolk association appears to have achieved its place in Tory
history almost by accident. The campaign leader, Mrs Aldine Horrigan, Tory
mayor of Haverhill, was not available for comment yesterday. But locals say
she had no intention of mounting a grassroots rebellion.
Meanwhile, the possibility that Mr Yeo might be forced to resign as an MP
appeared to be receding after several branches in his constituency gave him
their support. Mr John Major, prime minister, is to visit President Bill
Clinton in Washington in February or early March, Downing Street said
yesterday.

FT  08 JAN 94 / Ruling on French markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The French bourse and equity options markets moved closer to full
recognition in the UK yesterday after the Office of Fair Trading ruled that
there were no significant anti-competitive rules which governed their
operation.
The Treasury will now decide whether to approve the two exchanges - the
Societe des Bourses Francaises (SBF) and the Societe de Compensation des
Marches Conditionnels (SCMC), operator of the French equity options market
MONEP - as overseas investment exchanges in the UK.
In a report to the chancellor Mr Kenneth Clarke, Sir Bryan Carsberg,
director-general of fair trading, notes two rules which 'could have the
potential to produce significant anti-competitive effects - but do not
appear to do so at present'.
These two rules are requirements that members of the SBF have holdings of
its share capital and that they abide by certain price limits and trading
halts on the exchanges. Sir Bryan says he will keep these rules under review
but that they are not likely to have the effect of restricting, distorting
or preventing competition to any significant extent.
Approval would make it easier for UK securities firms which do not have
Paris-based operations to become members of the two exchanges. The two would
become the fifth and sixth authorised overseas investment exchanges approved
to operate in Britain.
The others include the New York Mercantile Exchange (Nymex) and the
Barcelona-based futures exchange Mercado de Futuros de Renta Fija.

FT  08 JAN 94 / Investor group may urge separate trading forum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A City organisation of small-company investors and stockbrokers will meet
next week to consider the establishment of a new exchange for start-up
companies separate from the London Stock Exchange.
The City Group for Smaller Companies (Cisco) is disappointed that the stock
exchange has failed to publish the report of its own working party which
recommended the establishment of a new so-called Enterprise Market for
smaller company shares.
The working party, which included several Cisco members, had broadly
endorsed Cisco's call for the stock exchange to establish the Enterprise
Market under its own auspices but with the addition of an independent board
and chief executive.
The stock exchange board met to consider the working party report last
month. It decided both not to publish the report and to commission
additional market research from MORI.
Yesterday, following the final meeting of the working party, Mr Giles
Vardey, the exchange's markets development director and a member of the
group, said: 'The exchange is wholly committed to finding sustainable ways
of meeting the needs of smaller growing companies. I want to make it
absolutely clear that the board has not rejected the working party's idea of
an Enterprise Market. What we need is stronger evidence of demand for a
separate market on these lines which would still be sufficiently different
from the Official List to be viable.'
The stock exchange's actions have left small-company supporters
disappointed. 'My feeling is that we now have to pursue an alternative,'
said Mr Ronald Cohen, partner at venture capitalists Apax Partners and a
member of both Cisco's board and the stock exchange's smaller companies
working party. Cisco's board will meet next Tuesday to consider the matter.
A stock exchange official said it was decided not to release the report as a
discussion document immediately because 'the board did not feel it could
endorse the recommendations. If it did release it, it would be difficult to
avoid the impression that it was an endorsement.'

FT  08 JAN 94 / Harrods boss moves to settle an old score: Robert Peston
explains how Mohamed Fayed is making legal use of his deal with Tiny Rowland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Mohamed Fayed is enjoying the spoils of the peace that recently broke out
between him and Mr Tiny Rowland, the joint chief executive of Lonrho with
whom he had been battling since 1985 over his takeover of Harrods and the
House of Fraser group of department stores.
Since the entente was reached with Mr Rowland in October, he has received
reams of documents from Lonrho. The writ he served yesterday, alleging
breach of confidence against Mr Graham Jones, House of Fraser's former
finance director, is the first tangible use he has made of them.
In 1991, the Bank of England forced Mr Fayed and his two brothers to give up
management control of Harrods Bank, a small profitable banking subsidiary of
the department store. The Fayeds transferred all voting shares in the bank
to an independent trustee, the Law Debenture Trust Corporation, though they
retained an economic interest through ownership of the non-voting shares.
Mr Fayed had long suspected that Mr Jones had supplied potentially damaging
information on the store group to Lonrho, the Bank of England and the
Commons treasury committee.
However, it is understood that the Bank's action was prompted mainly by the
conclusions of a report by Department of Trade and Industry inspectors,
published in 1990. The report said that the Fayed brothers had dishonestly
misrepresented their origins, wealth and business interests during the
Pounds 615m bid for House of Fraser.
None the less Mr Fayed was furious with Mr Jones. But he was unable to sue
him until Lonrho handed over handwritten notes and typed memoranda
purporting to show that Mr Jones gave it sensitive information and used this
information to damage House of Fraser.
Other documents show that Mr Jones received Pounds 555,418.07 in payments
from the Lonrho group of companies between April 1990 and June 26 1991.
Mr Fayed had dismissed Mr Jones in early 1990 after he discovered that a
business the company had just bought, Modena Engineering, which held a
Ferrari motor car franchise, had been making losses. He was angry with Mr
Jones for not discovering the losses before the deal was completed.
The letter terminating Mr Jones's employment at House of Fraser says that he
should not disclose confidential information about the company to outsiders
or use such information to harm it.
The writ makes several allegations against Mr Jones:
He is said to have supplied confidential information to Lonrho which it used
in a damaging propaganda document, called 'A Financial Assessment of the
Consolidated Personal and Commercial Interests of the Fayeds', published on
September 5 1990 and sent to leading bankers and accountants in the City in
an attempt to destabilise House of Fraser.
He is alleged to have given Lonrho a copy of a draft letter he had written
to the governor of the Bank of England, Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, now Lord
Kingsdown, saying that 'the Fayeds are men whose lack of probity and
integrity is abundantly clear and it is inconceivable to me that they could
be permitted to remain as holders of a banking licence'.
He tried to discredit House of Fraser in conversations with a Bank of
England official, Mr Peter Filmer, without disclosing to the Bank that he
was being paid by Lonrho.
He tried to persuade House of Fraser's lead bank, Midland, to withdraw
banking facilities from the department store group, without disclosing he
was being paid by Lonrho.
He informed the Commons trade and industry committee, which was examining
House of Fraser's ownership of Harrods Bank, that its banking facilities
would be withdrawn in the following 18 months, without disclosing he was
being paid by Lonrho.
The writ says that at about the same time as Mr Jones gave Lonrho a copy of
his letter to Mr Leigh-Pemberton, Lonrho paid Pounds 100,000 to Mr Jones's
account at the Bank in Liechtenstein. A Lonrho memo, authorising the
payment, says that payment was in return for 'his assistance with House of
Fraser matters'.
The memorandum continues: 'As far as possible it (the payment) should be
made discreetly'.
Mr Jones is also alleged to have provided Lonrho with a memo about the
relationship between Mr Fayed and Lord McAlpine, who was then treasurer of
the Conservative party. The memo says: 'Alastair McAlpine has attended
several meetings with the Fayeds at Harrods and an unknown number at 60 Park
Lane (where the Fayeds have offices) since he became treasurer of the
Conservative party'. It continues: 'Mohamed Fayed . . . has said 'Alastair
McAlpine is good man (sic). He help us, we help him'.' However, it says
there is 'no evidence of any donation by the Fayeds to the Conservative
party in the accounts of House of Fraser'.
Lord McAlpine said yesterday: 'The Fayeds never gave me or the Conservative
party any cash.'

FT  08 JAN 94 / Bifu warns on performance pay
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The banking ombudsman is to be warned by Bifu, the banking union, that moves
to put bank staff on performance pay will lead to growing friction with
customers.
The union said yesterday that it feared that performance targets and the
scrapping of traditional pay structures would mean more 'high-pressure'
selling of products.
Lloyds Bank last year introduced merit pay, and more than 75 per cent of its
staff received it, with average increases of 3.4 per cent.
Lloyds intends to maintain the scheme this year while the other clearing
banks have indicated to Bifu that they would like to discuss performance pay
shortly. Many building societies have already introduced performance pay.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
All large water companies in England and Wales have now agreed to reduce the
scope for changing price limits between regulatory reviews, which take place
every five years.
Mr Ian Byatt, the water industry regulator, said yesterday that 21 further
companies had agreed the new licence provisions, making 31 in total.
Until now, companies or the regulator have been able to seek changes in
price limits on eight possible grounds of 'relevant changes in
circumstance'. These are to be reduced to three for most companies.

FT  08 JAN 94 / Theatre company wins Pounds 3.3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Allied-Lyons, the food and drink company, is to sponsor the Royal
Shakespeare Company with Pounds 3.3m over the next three years, Antony
Thorncroft writes.
The money will be split between the theatre company's core activities and
international tours and educational projects.
The deal is vital to the future of the RSC. It has a deficit of Pounds 2.4m,
and at the end of 1993 Royal Insurance, which had been its principal
commercial backer for six years, ended its sponsorship.
Mr Adrian Noble, artistic director, said: 'After one of the bleakest years
ever for the arts we can celebrate Allied-Lyons's commitment to live
theatre, its young audiences and the international esteem in which theatre
in this country is held.'

FT  08 JAN 94 / Legal timetable spurs councils to sell off bus companies:
The reasons behind the privatisation of 25 municipal operations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Just when you thought one was never going to arrive they have all come along
together. Spurred on by a change in the rules governing their finances,
local authorities up and down the country have been racing to sell off their
bus companies.
Brighton Borough Transport was sold to its employees just before the new
year. In recent weeks Southampton City Council and the South Yorkshire
Passenger Transport Authority have disposed of their bus operations to their
managements. Grimsby and Cleethorpes have sold their jointly owned bus
company to Stagecoach Holdings, a quoted bus operator, and Leicester CityBus
has gone to GRT Holdings, another bus company.
This spate of sales was prompted by a change to the rules which from January
1 required local authorities to devote half the proceeds of assets sales to
paying off debt. Before, they could spend the money where they liked.
So far, 25 of the UK's 48 municipally owned bus companies have been sold,
although it is unlikely, in the absence of legislation requiring them to
sell, that all councils will do so. A dozen mainly Labour boroughs are
expected to retain control.
The 1985 Transport Act requires all boroughs to set up their bus operations
as separately managed companies. This same legislation swept away many of
the restrictions on bus services and allowed new operators to compete for
business. The government's intention was to free the buses from local
political interference and the constraints of public spending limits.
Operators would be able to raise private sector finance and diversify into
other areas of activity.
Costs and local authority subsidies have been reduced but continuing
declines in the numbers of passengers using the buses coupled with increases
in the route mileages run has pushed up average costs per passenger.
The most recent annual review by the Transport Advisory Service, a
consultancy, showed the average bus company's profit margin (pre-tax profits
as a percentage of turnover) at 3 per cent in 1991-92 - better than the 2.3
per cent for the year before but still not enough to allow them to renew
their fleets.
Some bus operators have blamed the recession for the continued decline in
passenger numbers, but others have managed increases despite the downturn.
Plymouth Citybus, still municipally owned, has increased passenger numbers
by 5 per cent a year over the past five years and converted a Pounds 400,000
annual subsidy into a pre-tax profit of Pounds 1.3m.
The ingredients for a successful bus operation include an aggressive
approach to bus frequencies, often combined with a switch from cumbersome
double-deckers to mini or midi buses; improved financial controls and a
crackdown on costs. Mr Brian Fisher, managing director of Plymouth Citybus,
said it had switched from two double deckers an hour on some routes to eight
mini-buses.
The smaller buses are cheaper to buy, operate and maintain and are nimbler
in traffic.
Badgerline, the quoted Bristol-based bus operator, put midi-buses on
less-travelled routes to allow no opening for competitors, explained Mr
Trevor Smallwood, executive chairman.
Plymouth Citybus now compiles monthly management accounts within five days
of the month end. Previously it produced quarterly ac-counts which took
another three months to prepare.
Many of the companies involved in the spate of municipal bus company sales
are small in terms of the overall size of the market - the planned
privatisation in 1994-95 of the 10 London bus companies, with combined
revenues of Pounds 370m, will represent a far more significant change.
Some people in the industry say the shake-up of the market has only just
begun. The next year or so is expected to see several more bus companies
taking the route to a London stock market listing.
Badgerline and Stagecoach, which together account for 8 per cent of the bus
market, are the only two listed bus companies. Possibles for flotation
include GRT Holdings, Go Ahead Northern and British Bus.
At the same time the large operations are expected to absorb many of the
smaller companies. Mr Smallwood said he expected 80 per cent of the local
bus market to be dominated by three or four large companies within 10 years.
Flotations and mergers may change the structure of the bus industry but
organic growth will depend to a large degree on planning policies which
favour public transport.
Local authorities see car-free zones, bus-only lanes and park-and-ride
schemes as ways to reduce traffic congestion. Increasingly, bus companies
are working on such schemes with the very local authorities from whose
clutches they have just been freed.

FT  08 JAN 94 / Job gains indicate solid US growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Official data showing a fall in the US jobless rate to 6.4 per cent last
month from a revised 6.5 per cent in November indicated solid economic
growth at the end of last year.
Many Wall Street analysts, however, interpreted accom-panying figures for
payroll employment as signalling a modest deceleration in the pace of
economic recovery. Slower - but still healthy - growth would reduce the
pressure for an early increase in short-term interest rates.
Non-farm employment rose 183,000 last month against analysts' projections of
an increase of about 225,000. The increase in November was revised down
slightly to 202,000. Roughly 2m new jobs were created during last year as a
whole.
The mix of employment gains was less encouraging than in previous months.
Private-sector employment rose 147,000 against 200,000 in November.
Manufacturing employment rose 2,000 against 26,000. Construction employment
fell slightly after a gain of 34,000 in November.
On Thursday Mr Robert Reich, labour secretary, predicted December data would
show 'employment rising, probably in the area of another 160,000 to
200,000'. As this was below the consensus forecast in financial markets,
bond prices rose as analysts' scaled back estimates of economic growth.
The fact Mr Reich's prediction was spot-on has revived charges he improperly
leaked the highly sensitive data. Officials, however, say Mr Reich made an
intelligent guess based on previously released figures.

FT  08 JAN 94 / France criticised on terror suspects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER and DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ZURICH, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Pressure is mounting on the French government to explain why it sent two
Iranian murder suspects back to Iran last week, in the process breaking a
formal agreement to extradite them to Switzerland.
The US State Department said in a statement that it was 'seeking
clarification' from the French government. 'The US believes that the rule of
law should be applied to terrorists,' it said.
Earlier, Mr Arnold Koller, the Swiss justice minister, said in a newspaper
interview that France's explanations for the move, which violated the
European conventions on extradition and the repression of terrorism, had so
far been 'wholly inadequate'.
In France too, criticism was growing. Mr Gerard Fuchs, a Socialist party
leader, said the government had dishonoured France. 'It is sad that France
has to take lessons from Switzerland on how to fight terrorism,' Mr Fuchs
said.
Prime Minister Edouard Balladur merely reiterated to journalists at a new
year meeting yesterday what his officials said when announcing the decision,
that it was related to the national interest.
Mr Alain Juppe, foreign minister, claimed in a radio interview that France
had not given in to pressure from Iran, and had nothing to learn from
Switzerland when it came to fighting terrorism.
The two Iranians, Moshen Sharif Esfahani and Ahmed Taheri, were arrested in
France in 1992 at the request of the Swiss authorities in connection with
the murder of Kazem Radjavi, the brother of a Mujahadeen leader, in a Geneva
suburb in April 1990.
Following their release on December 29, the Swiss foreign ministry made an
official diplomatic protest, but officials said there was nothing more they
could do as they did not want to sour relations with France.
However, Mr Koller's remarks suggest a subsequent toughening of the Swiss
position, possibly in response to suspicions among the Swiss public that
Bern was reacting spinelessly. He said the matter would be taken up at the
meeting of the federal council (cabinet) next Wednesday.
He rejected accusations that Switzerland, like France, was not unhappy with
a quiet resolution of a matter that could have sparked off fresh terrorism
in both countries.

A week-old peasant rebellion that began in Mexico's southernmost state
spread north yesterday, with all airports on maximum alert and the stock
exchange evacuated after a bomb threat, Reuter reports.
The rebels' Zapatista National Liberation Army, which began its uprising in
the hilly state of Chiapas, said it had toppled two 30-metre electricity
towers on Thursday in towns south of the capital.

FT  08 JAN 94 / Jordan, PLO sign bank deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES WHITTINGTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   AMMAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Jordan and the Palestine Liberation Organisation yesterday signed a long
awaited economic agreement which gives the Central Bank of Jordan
wide-ranging monetary responsibilities in the occupied territories during
the transitional period of Palestinian self-rule.
The deal was signed after three days of intense talks between Jordanian and
PLO officials in Amman. It followed a speech by King Hussein last week in
which he said the PLO had a 'last chance' to come to an agreement.
Its main impact will be to clear the way for the re-opening of Jordanian
banks in the West Bank and Gaza Strip which were closed following the 1967
war.
Non-Jordanian banks, such as the British Bank of the Middle East and ANZ
Grindlays, which had both expressed an interest in re-opening their
branches, have not been included at the moment.
A joint Jordanian-Palestinian monetary and banking committee will be
established to work under the CBJ on monetary policies in the occupied
territories during the interim period. It also provides for the continuation
of the Jordanian dinar as legal tender in the territories. One third of
Jordan's money supply is said to be in circulation in the West Bank.
The PLO leadership had previously postponed endorsing the deal, which has
been ready since November, for fear of relinquishing too many Palestinian
monetary responsibilities to the Jordanians. But the king's ultimatum, in
addition to an agreement between Jordan and Israel to go ahead with the
re-opening of banks without PLO consent, seems to have forced their hand.
Mr Mohammed Nashashibi, chairman of the PLO's department of economic affairs
and planning, described the deal as 'positive for both sides' and one which
'will increase co-ordination between the Palestinians and Jordanians'. Mr
Jawad Anani, Jordan's minister of information, said the accord met 'the
level of our ambitions'.
The agreement also provides for future co-ordination between Jordan and the
PLO on joint projects in the fields of agriculture, industry, commerce and
tourism.
It sets an initial figure of Dollars 300m (Pounds 200m) for two-way trade
across the Jordan River.

Inkatha, led by Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, has been holding bilateral talks

Saudi Arabia has asked the US to reschedule Saudi payments on around Dollars
30bn of military equipment purchases because of the impact of declining oil
revenues on its budget, US defence officials said yesterday.
A Pentagon spokesman said Prince Bandar bin Sultan, Saudi Arabia's
ambassador to the US, had met US officials in charge of foreign military
sales, as well as top executives from defence contractors, including General
Dynamics, McDonnell Douglas and Hughes Aircraft, to discuss the kingdom's
financial plight.
'We understand the financial issues facing Saudi Arabia. We believe they are
manageable and will continue to work toward a resolution on the
restructuring of the programme,' the Pentagon said. 'Programme adjustments
will focus on the timing of production and deliveries of major programme
items.'
With government revenues under pressure from weaker crude oil prices, Saudi
Arabia announced last weekend it would cut spending this year by 20 per cent
in order to curb its persistent budget deficit.
Saudi Arabia's military shopping list includes McDonnell's F-15 fighter,
General Dynamics' Abrams tank and Raytheon's Patriot missile defence system.

FT  08 JAN 94 / Benazir holds the cards in dynasty power game: Bhutto family
feud leaves Pakistan party leadership and military unmoved
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FARHAN BOKHARI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'This is not democracy, this is a police state. The day of celebrations has
been turned into a day of mourning. What is the difference between the
dictatorial regime of General Zia and this so-called democracy?'
These bitter words did not come from any ordinary opponent of Pakistan's
prime minister, Ms Benazir Bhutto. The speaker was Mrs Nusrat Bhutto, her
mother, after a week of family feuding triggered by the 66th birthday of the
late Mr Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, respectively their father and husband.
'Benazir Bhutto is responsible for all these incidents. It is a shame on
Benazir Bhutto,' Mrs Bhutto said after police fired on a crowd of
demonstrators on Wednesday, killing one and injuring seven.
The procession of several hundred people was attempting to march from the
family estate at Larkana, in the southern province of Sind, to Mr Bhutto's
grave on his birthday. Mr Bhutto was ousted as prime minister in 1977 and
hanged in 1979 by the military regime of Gen Zia-ul-Haq on charges of
ordering the assassination of a political foe.
His daughter, months after sweeping back to power in October's elections, is
now locked in an extraordinary power struggle within her family, reminiscent
of soap operas watched avidly by Pakistanis on satellite television.
Mrs Nusrat Bhutto, angry at being ousted from her position in the ruling
party, is supporting her son, who is in jail on terrorism charges, against
her daughter.
Mr Murtaza Bhutto, her son, faces charges of running an anti-government
terrorism campaign during 16 years of self-imposed exile. He returned to
Pakistan two months ago after winning election to the Sindh assembly from a
seat in Larkana while still abroad. His mother supported him in the
election.
After the election, Benazir Bhutto had her mother removed as co-chair of the
ruling Pakistan People's party, leaving the prime minister herself in sole
charge. Mrs Bhutto now wants her son to lead the party.
This week's eruption of the feud came after supporters of Mr Murtaza Bhutto
refused to allow Ms Benazir Bhutto to visit her father's grave unless he was
released on bail to preside over the birthday ceremonies.
The resulting confusion has seen armed police laying siege to 'Al-Murtaza',
ancestral home of the Bhuttos. Power supply to the house was cut and
telephones disconnected. But at the same time, fireworks celebrating the
late prime minister's birthday lit the sky and the music played on.
After the shooting, Mrs Nusrat Bhutto ordered her loyalists to cancel the
ceremonies. Servants were told to cut a large cake and distribute it among
the poor without fanfare. However, the prime minister's supporters continued
to celebrate. She visited her father's grave amid tight security.
Mrs Nusrat Bhutto plans to demand a full parliamentary debate on Wednesday's
events. Her daughter appears strong enough to keep her position, since there
are few signs of any divide within the party leadership, and the powerful
military and the bureaucracy do not want another change at the top after
last year's political turmoil.
Nevertheless, the feud is embarrassing for the prime minister, who faces
demands to remove from key positions party leaders who have been accused by
Mrs Bhutto of being enemies of her late husband.
For many family members, Mr Murtaza Bhutto's return has provided him with
the opportunity to claim leadership. His supporters are waiting for him to
emerge from prison to exert his authority as the clan's pugdaar - the one
entitled to wear the family's turban as a mark of leadership. However, the
future of the charges against him remains unclear.
The family feud could come to a head again on April 4, the anniversary of
the elder Mr Bhutto's execution. Once again, his grave could become the
centre of his children's fight to lay claim to the family dynasty.

FT  08 JAN 94 / Hong Kong suffers most from US-China trade arguments: A 25%
cut in textiles quotas has raised a storm in China that threatens Hong
Kong's entrepot trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE LUCAS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It takes just three words - Most Favoured Nation (MFN) - to send Hong Kong
companies and government heads alike into a spin. Each year they lash out at
the US administration for hurting Hong Kong interests when the real target
is China.
But when US Trade Representative Mickey Kantor announced on Thursday that US
quotas for China-made textile and garment goods would be slashed by 25 to 35
per cent the mood in the colony was remarkably subdued.
Remarkably, because re-export trade of China-made textiles and garments to
the US accounted for HKDollars 25bn (Pounds 2.175bn) last year and,
according to one trade lawyer's estimates, nine out of every 10 Hong Kong
manufacturers now rely on factories in China for their output. Re-exports
make up around three-quarters of the total volume of Hong Kong's trade: the
US and China are its two biggest partners.
China, in contrast to Hong Kong, blasted the US decision as 'irresponsible'
and warned of possible retaliation. 'This will have a serious impact on
Sino-US trade relations,' a statement from the Ministry of Foreign Trade and
Economic Co-operation said. 'If the US persists. . . this will force our
side to take corresponding and retaliatory measures.'
The statement said China wanted to continue to negotiate and did not outline
the possible retaliation.
Mr Chris Jackson, deputy director-general of Hong Kong's trade department,
said the government remained confident the two countries need each other too
much to remain at loggerheads for long. For now, he said, there is no sign
the move would effect Hong Kong's re-export trade: 'What the US side has
done is raised the stakes,' he said.
Mr Henry Tang, managing director of Peninsula Knitwear, is one of the
colony's key players in the sector. His company employs about 10,000 workers
in China, and around 80 per cent of the goods are exported to America.
He said: 'They (China and America) are keen to come to an agreement as soon
as possible, but not at any cost.
'If this gets implemented, obviously we will be hit. But the service
industry will be hit too. We cannot quantify the hit in cost terms, because
once China retaliates, the American (list) will escalate.'
If Hong Kong is playing this particular game with pokerfaced calm, it has
good reasons for doing so.
First, the policy will prove tough to implement. By definition,
transshipment is the result of high US demand for textile and clothing quota
supply. If manufacturers with more orders than they have quota allowances
cannot buy more quota, they can be tempted to falsify the country of origin.
Cutting that supply is likely to exacerbate the problem rather than relieve
it.
Mr Roy Delbyck, a lawyer representing several US importers buying in China,
said the US will simply drive up quota prices - which in turn will be passed
on to consumers - and create a bigger transshipment problem. 'If by cutting
quotas the US thinks it is going to wipe out transshipment or ameliorate it
it is sadly mistaken.'
Secondly, Hong Kong's argument that it is an innocent bystander in China's
MFN dispute with the US is not watertight in the case of transshipment. Many
textile and garment factories in China are controlled by companies in Hong
Kong, Macao, Singapore, Korea and Taiwan, which play a part in organising
such trade.
Third, much of Hong Kong's purchasing from China is done early in the year -
typically in the first four months - giving companies an early bite of
China's quota cake. Hints of quota cuts late last year prompted many to sort
quotas out even earlier than normal. Manufacturers have bought ahead, and
put goods into warehouses for extended storage.
Although the Hong Kong stock market fell 3.28 per cent to 11,001 yesterday,
for a two-day fall of almost 10 per cent, analysts said the quota
announcement alone had little effect on share prices.
The deeper worry for Hong Kong is that the US administration will go beyond
mere threats of quota cuts. China would respond by hitting out at the US in
key sectors such as aviation.
As piggy-in-the-middle, Hong Kong would not only lose trade volume: the
growing service industry would also suffer.

FT  08 JAN 94 / Washington speaks with one voice and sends mixed messages

'One of the things the Chinese need to understand,' said a senior US
Treasury official yesterday, 'is that for the first time in years,
Washington is speaking with one voice,' Nancy Dunne writes from Washington.
But even with one voice, it is sending very mixed messages. On Thursday,
administration officials threatened to slash China's textile quotas by more
than Dollars 1bn (Pounds 672m) a year in retaliation for alleged cheating on
quotas, but then approved the sale of three US satellites for launch on
Chinese rockets; announced that China was at last ready to open talks on its
missile sales; and praised Beijing's moves to open its market.
It was the textile action which made the headlines and brought threats of
retaliation from Beijing. Importers say no proof has been presented - even
to the Trade Representative's industry advisory group - of a transshipment
problem as massive as US officials claim.
Textiles negotiations are always complex and protracted. The latest have
been particularly difficult because the US has been insisting on the
inclusion of a specific clause against transshipment which allows for treble
penalties and provides authority to inspect overseas manufacturing
facilities. Sixteen countries have agreed to the measure, but nine -
including India and Pakistan - have not.
'It's a tough pill that we're asking China to swallow,' said Mr Rich Brecher
of the US-China Business Council. 'The US may have thought if it got China,
perhaps the others would fall into line.'
According to Ms Julia Hughes, vice president of government relations with
Associated Merchandising Corporation, the Chinese have begun to act against
transshipment and ought to be encouraged rather than criticised. Importers
see numerous avenues for compromise.
But the tough government line has left many in Washington perplexed over
whether it is a payoff to the domestic textile industry, a display of
machismo to prod China on human rights and further trade liberalisation, or
a miscalculation.

Japan is expected to press China to use its influence to encourage North
Korea to allow international inspections of all its nuclear sites when Mr
Tsutomu Hata, the Japanese foreign minister, arrives in Beijing today to
meet his counterpart, Mr Qian Qichen.
'This is of vital, vital interest to both countries' and Japan expected
China to play a 'big role', said a foreign ministry official. Earlier in the
week, North Korea agreed in principle to allow International Atomic Energy
Agency inspections of seven sites, but did not agree to let inspectors visit
two more suspected and undeclared nuclear facilities.
Mr Hata's two-day visit is his third meeting with the Chinese foreign
minister since Japan's coalition government took power last August. Contacts
have increased partly for economic reasons, as bilateral trade between China
and Japan rose to an estimated record Dollars 35bn last year, from Dollars
25.3bn in 1992.
China is still unsure of the new government in Tokyo. It wants to maintain
continuity of relations with Japan, which it sees as an important
intermediary with the US, as well as a trade partner. Japanese loans to
China, nuclear testing and environmental policy could also be discussed,
said Japanese officials.

FT  08 JAN 94 / Japanese rates decline as pessimism deepens: Doubts grow
over economic recovery prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japanese long-term interest rates fell to a new six-year low yesterday
because of mounting pessimism over the economy and speculation of an
imminent discount rate cut.
The yield on the No 157 ten-year benchmark government bond fell to 2.97 per
cent, breaching the 3 per cent level for the first time since June 1987.
Delays in the government's announcement of an emergency economic package
together with a big income tax cut have raised doubts over prospects for
economic recovery soon.
The inability of Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, to take economic
initiatives because of a parliamentary wrangle over political reform has
fuelled expectations of a cut in the official discount rate, which is
already at an historic low of 1.75 per cent.
Long-term interest rates have fallen steadily over the past year as hopes
over the government's promised economic recovery have faded because of
falling consumption, an ailing financial system, and a sharp rise in the
yen. The yield on the 10-year benchmark has declined by more than 150 basis
points from the start of last year.
Even if the government announces a package of fiscal support measures later
this month, analysts do not expect interest rates to rise. 'People need some
convincing signs of an economic upturn to take profits, and that won't come
until the spring,' said Mr Robert Feldman, an economist at Salomon Brothers
in Tokyo.
Another reason for the bond market rally has been the poor performance of
the Tokyo stock market. Additionally, investors wary of foreign currency
risk have avoided placing funds in overseas markets and have opted for
domestic government bonds.
Although some investors are becoming cautious at current levels, many still
expect yields to fall further, with the 10-year benchmark falling through
the record low 2.55 per cent reached in April 1987.
Meanwhile, a fall in construction orders highlighted intensifying economic
gloom. The Japan Federation of Construction Contractors said orders in
November fell 16.6 per cent from the year before.

FT  08 JAN 94 / Eastern Europe asks Nato for more

<TEXT>
Four former Warsaw Pact countries yesterday reluctantly accepted a
US-inspired Nato plan offering them closer links with the alliance, but
demanded assurances that it would eventually lead to full membership.
The 'Partnership for Peace' project, due to be endorsed by Nato leaders at a
summit in Brussels next week, has disappointed the east European countries
and Lithuania because it falls short of offering the explicit security
guarantees which go with full membership.
A statement issued yesterday in Warsaw by the defence chiefs of Poland,
Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia made clear that the four countries,
while accepting the Nato offer for the moment, were keeping up pressure for
a firm alliance commitment to full membership in the future.
The four ministers, whose countries are collectively known as the Visegrad
group, have sought membership of Nato for fear of being isolated while new
threats were developing to their security from an increasingly unstable
Russia, currently in the grip of resurgent nationalism.
Russia, however, has warned Nato not to give full membership to its four
former allies, which would expand the alliance eastwards to Russia's own
frontiers and infuriate the country's military leaders.
This warning has been taken on board by US President Bill Clinton and other
western leaders, who are particularly anxious to avoid strengthening the
position of extreme Russian nationalists like Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky and
undermining President Boris Yeltsin's reform programme.
In Washington, Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, went on
record with a statement that the Nato plan should be open to all eastern
European countries, without discrimination. 'We welcome the anticipation of
Russia's membership in Partnership for Peace,' he said yesterday.
Germany, the strongest western advocate of east European membership of Nato,
said it could go no further than it had already done to help the eastern
European countries' ambitions. 'What these countries want - to be sure that
nobody can attack them without Nato intervening - is something they cannot
get, at least not in the initial phase,' Mr Klaus Kinkel, the German foreign
minister, said in Bonn.
George Graham writes from Washington: US officials said yesterday they
expected next week's Nato meeting to reaffirm its threat to launch air
strikes against Serbian forces in Bosnia if the 'strangulation' of Sarajevo
and other Bosnian cities continued.
Although conditions had improved after Nato first issued the threat last
August, they had again deteriorated in recent weeks, one senior
administration official said, and the US was now 'deeply concerned' about
the situation in Sarajevo. But the US is anxious Bosnia should not dominate
the Nato meeting. US and British diplomats have told Serbian President
Slobodan Milosevic to stop Bosnian Serbs from continuous bombardment of
Sarajevo and to concentrate on negotiations, Reuter reports from the UN.
Britain's UN ambassador, Sir David Hannay, told reporters that envoys from
both embassies in Belgrade made a demarche to tell Mr Milosevic the 'bombing
was deadly unproductive'. Diplomatic sources said Mr Milosevic said he would
do his best.

FT  08 JAN 94 / Reform politicians lose spirit as old ways die hard in
Russia: Yeltsin seems less concerned about the dangers of stoking up
inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Russia's pro-market reformers are under siege and economic change, already a
battered concept, is again in doubt.
Since last month's election, which saw a surge by ultra-nationalist,
communist and communist-inclined parties, the small band of economic
radicals around first deputy premier Yegor Gaidar have been fighting to win
over President Boris Yeltsin.
They have been trying to convince him of one thing: that the parliamentary
election results should not mean a change of economic course.
To drop reforms before they have been properly tried or even introduced,
they argue, would mean to lose everything.
But they now fear it has not worked. They are privately preparing for an
exit from the political stage.
Nothing is yet definite and Mr Yeltsin has in the past surprised everyone
with his ability to buck trends and back reform. But they believe the
immediate future is bleak.
There is ample evidence. Mr Yeltsin, in his pronouncements since the
election, has been unclear what he wants. Now he says reform will continue,
now he counsels caution.
More importantly, he has made decisions that point to a conviction that
production must be supported, even if this drives inflation up again. In
December inflation was down to around 10 per cent a month, an all-year low.
Mr Yeltsin has seen a number of big industrialists and they have all
demanded cash. Many, including the giant agricultural equipment maker,
Rostelmash, have got it, as has Russia's car industry. The GAZ car plant,
whose workers are all temporarily laid off this month, will introduce a new
luxury model, the GAZ 3105, within two years.
The cash-strapped defence industry has also got some relief. The MiG plant,
which has long made Soviet fighters, has produced a prototype MiG110
passenger/cargo aircraft that will go into production in 1998. A new bomber
from the Sukhoi plant, the SU-34, will replace the present SU-24 (produced
to match the US F-111).
Mr Yeltsin has also signed a decree allowing Dollars 500m to be spent on a
new parliament - a decision Mr Gaidar criticised, saying it had not come
before the government and if it had he would have voted against it.
'All of these decisions point in one direction.' said an economist working
for the reformists yesterday. 'It shows he no longer cares for the effect on
inflation.'
This is largely blamed on the growing power of advisers around him who are
much more conservative than his chief of staff, Mr Sergei Filatov. Mr
Filatov is linked to Mr Gaidar as both are members of Russia's Choice, the
main liberal party.
The daily Sevodnya this week ran an apparently well founded report that Mr
Filatov has lost a lot of ground after his failure to secure election
victory for the reformers. According to the report, Mr Viktor Ilyushin,
conservative head of the president's chancellery and an old comrade from Mr
Yeltsin's days as Communist Party secretary in Sverdlovsk, now guards access
to him and influences his choice of decrees.
At the same time, the appointment of ministers and creation of a new
programme are the subject of the bitterest struggle behind the scenes.
Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, has said that the government's
size will be cut to just four deputy premiers (the inner cabinet) and 30
ministers.
But the decree that would appoint Mr Gaidar as one of two first deputy
premiers, with Mr Oleg Soskovets as the other, has twice gone to Mr Yeltsin
for signature and twice been blocked.
The fate of the other two main reformers - Anatoly Chubais and Boris
Fyodorov - hangs in the balance. Both are said to be wary of taking part in
the new government, especially if Mr Viktor Gerashchenko, head of the
Central Bank, remains in his post.
Mr Gerashchenko, who has long advocated re-creating an economic union,
appears to have scored a notable victory earlier this week. It came when the
prime ministers and central bankers of Russia and Belarus signed an
agreement in principle for an economic union.
The pact would give Belarus the right to use the Russian rouble and to
determine the amount of cash and credits it would get. This would in effect
make Minsk, the Belarus capital, a second centre for the emission of roubles
and give its ailing industries a credit lifeline to the Russian central
bank.
This type of agreement - likely to be extended to the Central Asian republic
of Tajikistan - is seen by Russian conservatives as a model for preserving
industrial and economic links, gravely damaged over the past two years. It
is also seen as a model for extending the power of the Russian state, one of
the main themes in the successful electoral campaigns of the nationalists
and communists.
For the reformers, it is a return to the politics of hyperinflation. They
thought they had stemmed hyperinflation last year when credits to other
former Soviet republics were choked off and inflation fell as a result.
Finally, the new parliament is likely to be dominated by nationalist and
communist forces and their allies.
The pro-market parties - Russia's Choice, the Yabloko group and the Party of
Unity and Accord - have failed to agree with each other. Mr Gaidar said on
Thursday that Russia's Choice had pulled out of talks aimed at agreeing on a
Speaker for the lower house, or State Duma, because the nationalists and
communists were now controlling the agenda in talks with Mr Chernomyrdin.
Russia this weekend celebrates the orthodox Christmas, and all official
business is suspended. Next week sees the convention of the new parliament,
and the visit to Moscow of President Bill Clinton.
It is still possible a reform course will again be taken. But the reformers
say it is more likely that reform will fall victim to popular discontent,
conservative pressure and their own inability to unite.

FT  08 JAN 94 / Axe hovers over 33,000 steel workers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The west European steel industry may have to cut more than 33,000 jobs in
1994, the European Commission warned yesterday. It said 1994 would be
particularly bad for job losses in the steel industry, which is being forced
to restructure to cope with lack of demand and overcapacity.
According to the most recent figures submitted by the 12 EU member states,
337,500 people are employed in the EU steel industry - more than a third of
them in Germany.
The Commission said in its 'forward programme' for the steel industry,
published yesterday, that job losses 'might well reach or even exceed 10 per
cent of the workforce' in 1994. It warned that the greatest impact would be
felt in Germany, Italy and Spain, but all member states except Denmark and
Ireland would be affected by job losses.
However, Brussels also sent a strong signal to EU steel producers that they
must not shy away from promises to cut production as soon as possible.
'The fundamental restructuring announced by the (EU) steel industry is. . .
still vital and the fact that there are no prospects of an improvement in
the steel market means that urgent decisions have to be taken regarding a
reduction in production capacity,' the Commission warned.
The Commission forecasts that production of crude steel will slip from an
estimated 128.9m tonnes in 1993, to 126.5m tonnes in 1994, with net actual
consumption remaining unchanged at just over 116m tonnes.
Just before Christmas, EU industry ministers approved Ecu6.8bn of state
subsidies for publicly owned steelmakers, in exchange for capacity cuts
amounting to more than 5m tonnes. The Commission is now urging
non-subsidised steel producers to carry out their side of the bargain, and
cut production by a further 25m tonnes, to ease overcapacity. Private
steelmakers have protested strongly about the compromise on subsidies and
predicted dire consequences.
Commission officials said demand was unlikely to pick up in 1994. But they
said EU rescue plans - including the deal on state aid and previously agreed
programmes of financial support, and protection from cheap non-EU steel
imports - would help ease steel producers' financial situation in the second
half of 1994.

FT  08 JAN 94 / Trichet outlines vision of 'open and democratic' independent
central bank: David Buchan and John Ridding meet the Bank of France governor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN and JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An old institution was reborn yesterday: 194 years after being created by
Napoleon to help him wage war on Britain, the Bank of France has been made
independent, the better to wage war on inflation and to protect the franc
from the vagaries of political interference.
Yesterday saw the formal installation by Prime Minister Edouard Balladur of
the central bank's Monetary Policy Committee, whose nine members are
forbidden by law from 'accepting or soliciting' outside instruction in the
determination of French interest rates.
But how will the team operate under the 1993 law which, for all its
extensive borrowing from the Maastricht treaty and the statutes and
experience of independent central banks in Germany and the US, creates a
distinctive Gallic model?
In his first press interview following this week's nomination of the MPC, Mr
Jean-Claude Trichet, governor of the Bank of France, spelt out some of the
guiding principles in the committee's composition and future operation.
In addition to Mr Trichet and his two deputy governors - Mr Denis Ferman and
Mr Herve Hannoun - six outsiders have been chosen by the Balladur government
and President Mitterrand to sit on the committee from a shortlist of 18
names proposed by the presidents of the National Assembly, the Senate and
the Economic and Social Committee.
Roping so many institutions and leaders into the nomination process ensures
the MPC's composition is 'the least contested possible,' says Mr Trichet.
Paradoxically, too, he says centralised France may have actually produced a
more diverse body to steer its monetary policy than in federal Germany or
the US where regional central bankers make up much of the Bundesbank and
Federal Reserve boards.
The six outsiders come from finance, insurance, industry, academe,
journalism and politics. 'With such outstanding personalities, I wonder if
one does not have more diversity than in a federal system, whose regional
banks are inevitably filled by people with the same career and professional
experience.'
Precisely because the outsiders are so diverse, much may fall on the
shoulders of Mr Trichet and his two deputies, certainly at the outset,
though the governor stresses the new 'collegiality of decision-making'. The
Bank of France has not yet set its monetary targets for 1994 but is likely
to have to do so by the end of the month.
These targets will probably be announced at a press conference, which the
hitherto secretive Old Lady of the Rue de la Vrilliere has rarely indulged
in. 'In a democracy, I believe that an independent institution should both
listen and explain itself,' says Mr Trichet.
Referring to the bank's democratic accountability as absolutely central, Mr
Trichet sees two important bridges between the central bank and the
executive and legislature. In the first case, the government has access to
the MPC - the prime minister or the economy minister can attend meetings but
they have no vote, as in Germany.
'The experience in Germany is that this is a good thing, it allows
communication between government and central bank while the law is
unambiguous in protecting the latter's independence.'
Of considerable importance - not least to the French parliament's desire to
increase its feeble powers under the Fifth Republic - is the Bank of
France's new answerability to deputies.
Mr Trichet must now report at least once a year to the National Assembly and
the Senate, which can also summon him to appear before them more often. 'The
bank governor can also ask to be heard by these bodies - it is a symmetrical
arrangement, which could be useful. . . I think it is a duty for the
governor to be as active as possible in his relations with the parliament
and its finance committees,' says Mr Trichet.
The outcome could be a mixture between the practice of the Fed chairman
making set-piece appearances before Congress and the Bundesbank's tendency
to rely more on press conferences. One practice of the Fed's open market
committee that Mr Trichet seems loath to adopt is delayed publication of the
minutes and votes of past committee meetings. 'I think that whatever the
vigour of internal arguments and debate, the credit of our institution will
depend very much on the unity it projects, once decisions are taken.'
Mr Trichet does not appear to anticipate much internal argument over the
price stability which the law sets as the MPC's overriding goal, but does
not define precisely. Defining price stability is, he says, 'more an art
than a science. . . but I don't think anyone in the world would consider
that a rate of 2 per cent inflation (the current rate in France) is abnormal
from the point of stability'.
He is keen to dispel the charge of being 'a monetary Ayatollah' which some
levelled at him last summer, when as director of the Tresor he fought to
maintain the value of the franc against the D-Mark. He sees no contradiction
between a rigorous anti-inflation policy and best possible borrowing terms
on the markets.
'With all the financial markets interconnected, once you get outside the
area of very short-term rates which can be controlled by a national monetary
authority, your rates depend on a judgment by investors around the world.
Your credibility and stability - if they are perceived as real by investors
 -give you an immediate advantage in the market. (Central bank) independence
is a plus for this credibility and stability.' Mr Trichet flourishes yield
charts to show that, Japan apart, France has the lowest rates among the
Group of Seven countries.
Cautioning against recent errors in forecasting European or world growth
trends, Mr Trichet nonetheless concedes that France is locked into
continental Europe's current sluggish cycle. But he argues that France is
well poised for faster growth because of the country's trade surplus, the
good cash flow of its larger companies and the net creditor position of its
households.
Yet it seems most unlikely that the Bank of France will use its new
independence to make a dash for growth - any more than it will make a dash
for a partial monetary union in Europe.
The Bank of France may now resemble the Bundesbank. 'But I refuse completely
to engage in discussions of accelerating monetary union, a two-tier or a
three-tier Europe. . . We have got to make Maastricht live and apply it
scrupulously, and this I intend to do with Hans Tietmeyer (the Bundesbank
president), with Eddie George (the Bank of England governor) and my nine
other European central bank colleagues.'

FT  08 JAN 94 / Belgrade's army fights in Bosnia
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Regular Yugoslav troops are being deployed in Bosnia, United Nations
officers on the ground confirmed yesterday.
In a week in which the international community has been criticised by senior
UN officials for failing to stop the war in Bosnia, Norwegian Captain
Jantora Strandas with the Nordic contingent, yesterday verified that
Yugoslav army paratroopers are routinely engaged in hostilities in Bosnia.
His comments refute claims by Serb leaders that they have not supported
Bosnian Serb forces, who control 70 per cent of the republic.
It also undermines demands this week by Belgrade for the lifting of
sanctions, imposed 19 months ago over the violent partition of Bosnia.
Observers and local residents have confirmed the long-term presence of
Yugoslav army paratroopers and vehicles in northern and eastern Bosnia.
'Just stand in Zvornik (on the Bosnian-Serb frontier) and watch the Yugoslav
army cross over,' Capt Strandas said yesterday at the UN Pancevo base, near
Belgrade.
His remarks follow a scathing denunciation of the UN by outgoing commander
of UN Protection Forces in Bosnia, Belgian General Francis Briquemont, for a
'fantastic gap' between resolutions and the political will to carry them
out.
By way of illustration of the powerlessness of Unprofor against Serbian
intransigence, Capt Strandas pointed to 11 German-made Leopard tanks. For
three months, the tanks with their 105mm guns, have stood idle in an open
shed, even though 'they need exercise,' he said.
Bosnian Serb leaders reneged on their pledge to allow the Leopards to cross
frontlines to support UN troops in Tuzla, a government stronghold in
north-eastern Bosnia, surrounded by Serb forces.
So, instead of a three-hour trip, the tanks will go on a three-day rail
journey from Pancevo, through Hungary, Austria, and Italy, a sea voyage
across the Adriatic to Croatia and then a drive through disputed territory
in central Bosnia. What's more, the UN is being asked to pay Dollars 1m to
Belgrade for their passage through Serbia.

FT  08 JAN 94 / German economists call for interest rate cut
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Germany's respected Ifo economics institute yesterday added its voice to a
growing chorus calling for the Bundesbank to help push the economy out of
recession with lower interest rates.
But the bank appeared determined not to move until it had a clearer picture
of inflationary prospects. Mr Hans Tietmeyer, Bundesbank president, said on
Thursday night that monetary policy had been put on 'hold' until
policy-makers had more information.
'We will wait until we can see how things develop,' he said after a routine
council meeting at which the short-term discount and lombard rates were left
unchanged at 5.75 per cent and 6.75 per cent respectively.
The Munich-based Ifo recommended a reduction in money market rates to about
3 or 4 per cent by the end of this year. Experience showed that reduced
short-term rates did not result in higher long-term rates.
As Mr Tietmeyer stressed at his Thursday meeting with journalists, more than
two-thirds of all private investment in Germany is financed with long-term
borrowings. The central bank traditionally focuses most of its attention on
this end of the money market.
The call from Ifo followed earlier accusations from the DIW institute in
Berlin that the Bundesbank's go-slow policy was prolonging the recession.
The discount and lombard rates were last cut on October 22.
More information on inflationary trends - notably the latest consumer price
figures and end-of-year money supply figures - will be available for
consideration at the bank's next council meeting on January 20.
The bank yesterday confirmed earlier estimates which showed the M3 measure
of money supply growing at an annualised rate of 7.2 per cent in November,
well above the upper limit of last year's target range of 4.5 to 6.5 per
cent. Inflation is also expected to be pushed up this month by new duties on
fuel and higher charges for services.
The bank, which last month tightened its M3 target range to 4 to 6 per cent,
has already warned that it expects money supply figures early this year to
be distorted by a 'monetary over-hang' from last year.

The Conseil des Bourses de Valeurs (CBV), the French stock market watchdog,
has appointed Mr Rene Barbier de La Serre, chief executive of the Credit
Commercial de France (CCF) banking group, as its chairman, writes Alice
Rawsthorn in Paris.
He will replace Mr Bruno de Maulde, who resigned last week to join the newly
independent Bank of France's monetary policy council.
Mr de La Serre, 53, has spent most of his career in banking but has for some
years been a member of the CBV.
France yesterday announced it had chalked up another healthy trade surplus
in October, confirming it is well on its way to a record surplus for 1993,
Reuter adds.
Provisional customs office data showed a seasonally adjusted trade surplus
in October of FFr8.7bn (Pounds 1bn) against a revised surplus of FFr9.91bn
in September.

FT  08 JAN 94 / Viacom and Blockbuster strike Dollars 8.4bn merger deal:
Link-up raises cash offer for Paramount to Dollars 105 a share
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Viacom, the US cable television company, and Blockbuster Entertainment, the
world's largest video retailer, last night announced an Dollars 8.4bn
(Pounds 5.6bn) merger agreement, together with a sharp increase in the cash
being offered by Viacom in the five-month-old takeover battle for Paramount
Communications.
Viacom, with financial help from Blockbuster, increased its cash offer for
50.1 per cent of Paramount's stock from Dollars 85 a share to Dollars 105 a
share, or Dollars 6.5bn, topping the Dollars 92 a share cash offer on the
table from rival QVC Network.
However, Viacom also substantially reduced the value of the package of
securities it is offering Paramount shareholders for the remaining 49.9 per
cent of the company.
The Viacom-Blockbuster merger will create a new US entertainment giant in
its own right, while the higher cash offer for Paramount appears to give
back to Viacom the initiative it lost to QVC last month.
Analysts say Paramount is likely to be won by the bidder putting most cash
on the table. Mr Barry Diller, chairman of QVC, and other companies which
have backed his bid, must now decide whether to match or top Viacom's cash
component.
The Viacom-Blockbuster deal takes the form of an all-paper offer by Viacom,
which will give Blockbuster investors 0.08 of a share of Viacom class A
voting stock, 0.60615 of a share of non-voting B stock, and one 'variable
common right' (a security whose value depends on the share price of Viacom)
for each Blockbuster share.
The deal values Blockbuster at about Dollars 8.4bn, based on the company's
closing share price on Thursday of Dollars 29 7/8 .
Blockbuster, which last September agreed to invest Dollars 600m in Viacom to
finance its Paramount bid, has now given additional assistance by agreeing
to invest Dollars 1.25bn in Viacom, provided it wins the Paramount battle,
through the purchase of 23m shares of Viacom B stock at Dollars 55 a share.
That compares to a closing price last night of Dollars 41, down Dollars 1
3/4 .
The shares being bought by Blockbuster at an above-market price give Viacom
the money to raise the cash element of its bid, while reducing by a similar
amount the number of shares being offered to Paramount shareholders for 49.9
per cent of their stock.
Mr Sumner Redstone, chairman of Viacom, will be chairman of the combined
Viacom-Blockbuster group and will own 61 per cent of voting stock. Mr Wayne
Huizenga, chairman of Blockbuster, will be vice-chairman.
The board of the new company will have six directors nominated by Viacom,
three from Blockbuster and two from Nynex, the Baby Bell telephone company
which is also financially backing the Paramount bid. However, no new funds
were provided yesterday by Nynex.
Viacom is best known for its innovative cable television networks, such as
the pop music channel MTV, while Blockbuster has been expanding beyond its
video retailing roots into music retailing, the Hollywood film industry and
theme parks.

FT  08 JAN 94 / Bush fires reach Sydney suburbs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A resident of Sydney's northern suburbs hoses down his roof in an effort to
hold back the flames as Australia's worst bush fires in a decade rage only
six miles from the city centre.
Three people have died in the fires sweeping New South Wales. Yesterday,
thousands more were evacuated and up to 70 houses destroyed, some exploding
in the intense heat. Unless the searing temperatures and winds drop, at
least 3,000 homes are expected to be lost this weekend.
The fires, which stretch along 500 miles of the state's coastline, are being
fought by more than 7,000 firefighters. Sydney centre is not under threat,
although the smell of burning eucalyptus trees and black smoke has reached
the city, and power has been interrupted.

FT  08 JAN 94 / Secret payments by Lonrho alleged: Writ claims director got
Pounds 555,000 for help against Fayeds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON and ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lonrho is alleged to have paid Pounds 555,000 to the former finance director
of House of Fraser, a man who supplied damaging information on the owners of
Harrods to the Bank of England and a House of Commons select committee.
Details of the alleged secret payments to Mr Graham Jones, which included
Pounds 100,000 paid into a Liechtenstein bank account, are disclosed in a
writ lodged in the High Court yesterday by House of Fraser, which is owned
by the Egyptian Fayed brothers.
The Lonrho memo authorising the Pounds 100,000 payment to Mr Jones said it
was for 'his assistance with House of Fraser matters'.
House of Fraser is suing Mr Jones for breach of confidence. The writ says
that in 1990 Mr Jones supplied financial information to Lonrho which helped
the conglomerate in its propaganda war against House of Fraser.
Mr Tiny Rowland, Lonrho's joint chief executive, had been fighting the
Fayeds since 1985, when they bought House of Fraser for Pounds 615m. He had
always wanted to own the store group and believed that the Fayeds had won it
by deception.
Last October he made peace with the Fayeds and is understood to have given
them documents allowing them to launch their case against Mr Jones.
'I will not make any comment at all,' said Mr Jones, who resigned in
November as chief financial officer of Qantas, the Australian airline, when
asked yesterday about the payments.
The writ says that between April 1990 and June 26 1991 he received Pounds
555,418.07 from the Lonrho group. He had left House of Fraser in January
1990 with a compensation package the company described as substantial.
Mr Jones had also signed a letter terminating his employment in which he
undertook not to disclose confidential information about the company. The
writ says that in June 1990, Mr Jones supplied information to a Bank of
England manager, Mr Peter Filmer, that the Fayeds were not fit to own
Harrods Bank, a small banking subsidiary of House of Fraser.
In April, Mr Jones had written to the Bank governor, at that time Mr Robin
Leigh-Pemberton, now Lord Kingsdown, claiming that Mr Mohamed Fayed had
wanted to circumvent regulations preventing the bank receiving a Pounds 100m
deposit from the Sultan of Brunei.
The Bank was unaware that Lonrho was paying Mr Jones. In June 1991, it
forced the Fayeds to surrender their management control of Harrods Bank to
an independent trustee, although the Fayeds retained control of non-voting
shares in it.
However, it is understood that the Bank took this action mainly as a result
of an investigation into the House of Fraser takeover by Department of Trade
and Industry inspectors, which said that the Fayeds had dishonestly
misrepresented their origins, wealth and business interests.
Mr Jones is also alleged to have informed the House of Commons Trade and
Industry Committee, which was examining House of Fraser's ownership of
Harrods Bank, that its banking facilities would be withdrawn in the
following 18 months.
A member of that committee said yesterday that even if the committee had
known Lonrho was paying Mr Jones, the committee would not have changed its
view that the Fayeds should give up control of Harrods bank.
The writ says Mr Jones tried to persuade House of Fraser's banks to withdraw
their loan facilities. Mr Ernie Cole, who was then a senior executive of
Midland Bank, which was House of Fraser's lead bank, said yesterday he had
several conversations with Mr Jones and was 'not pleased' to be told of the
alleged payments to him by Lonrho.
Mr Terry Robinson, a former Lonrho director who was responsible for
compiling propaganda documents attacking House of Fraser, said yesterday it
was 'extremely surprising' that Lonrho had provided information to the
Fayeds on its relationship with Mr Jones.
Mr Rowland yesterday referred all questions on his relationship with Mr
Jones to the Fayeds.

FT  08 JAN 94 / New status of French bank 'will boost franc'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Bank of France's new independence in setting monetary policy would help
to fight inflation and reinforce the 'international credibility' of the
franc, Mr Edouard Balladur, French prime minister, said yesterday.
Installing the central bank's new board and monetary policy committee, Mr
Balladur told its members that they now had the 'very heavy responsibility .
. . of being the guardians of the nation's currency'.
He promised to 'scrupulously observe' the independence of the bank's
nine-member monetary policy committee, who are forbidden by law to accept or
solicit outside instructions in determining interest rates.
The new bank law, closely modelled on the Bundesbank statutes, gives the
prime minister and the economy minister the right to attend - but not to
vote at - monetary meetings. Mr Balladur said he would exercise this right
'rarely, but, like the German chancellor with the Bundesbank, I will do when
it seems right'.
He and Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister, attended the start of the
first formal meeting of the committee, whose six outside members later drew
lots to decide the length of their terms of office. Eventually, all outside
appointees will serve a non-renewable nine-year term. But initially some
will serve less so that two of their number can change every three years.
Yesterday Mr Michel Sapin, a former Socialist finance minister, and Mr
Michel Albert, former head of the AGF insurance group, got nine-year terms;
Mrs Denise Flouzat, an economist, and Mr Jean-Pierre Gerard, an
industrialist, got six years; and Mr Jean Boissonat, a journalist, and Mr
Bruno de Maulde, a financier, three years.
Mr Balladur said he was confident that the Bank of France would match the
performance of the independent Bundesbank and US Federal Reserve Board.
Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, the Bank of France governor who, along with his two
deputies, is an ex-officio member of the committee, claimed that the French
people, often considered 'flighty or inconstant' in other matters, were now
'firmly attached to the value of their money'.

FT  08 JAN 94 / Reformers set for opposition role in Russia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD and GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Russia's leading reformers believe they are unlikely to survive as members
of the country's next government in the face of a surge in power of
conservative forces.
Pro-market parties did badly in the parliamentary elections last month at
the hands of nationalist and communist groups, which are now set to dominate
the new parliament.
The reformers have told aides they are now preparing for an opposition role,
and that the tide is flowing strongly in favour of a return to
state-controlled, interventionist policies aimed at supporting industries
and preserving employment.
Western advisers, who had been assisting reformers preparing an economic
plan for a new government, are now pessimistic about the chances of a
reformist government being appointed.
Professor Jeffrey Sachs, the Harvard University economist who advises
Russian ministers, said last night that 'it looks as if it's pretty far down
the road towards the end for the reformers. The return of the old guard is
not inevitable still, but it now seems the most likely outcome'.
Mr Yegor Gaidar, first deputy prime minister and the reformists' leader,
said that a 'close coalition' of communists and nationalists had been formed
which was 'imposing conditions' on the choice of leaders of the new
parliament, which meets for the first time next Tuesday.
He said the party he leads, Russia's Choice, would take no further part in
talks on the appointment of a parliamentary speaker.
At the same time, a range of decisions taken by President Boris Yeltsin and
by Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, point to their acceptance of
the need for a centrist economic course in which industries - including
military plants - will be heavily subsidised and a strong push made to form
a tight economic union with former Soviet republics under Russia's
leadership. Reformers say such a course would destroy any hope of financial
stabilisation because of these republics' needs for cheap credits and
subsidised energy.
An agreement in principle reached this week between the prime ministers and
central bank chairmen of Russia and Belarus to unite the two countries'
economies under a common currency is seen by reformers as a strong
indication the conservatives have won the internal argument.
Mr Chernomyrdin, commending the deal this week, pointedly linked it with the
lack of agreement with Ukraine, where the economy is in steep decline and
pro-union forces are agitating for economic union with Russia.
George Graham adds from Washington: Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US treasury secretary,
said the US would urge Mr Yeltsin to 'deepen the process of market reform',
but that the west should pay more attention to the economic pain of the
Russian people.

FT  08 JAN 94 / European markets up as rate fears ease
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND and MICHAEL MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stock markets in Europe advanced yesterday after significantly improved
employment statistics from the US eased fears of upward pressures on global
interest rates.
In London, renewed buying of UK stocks from across the Atlantic drove the
FT-SE 100 index ahead by 43 points to 3,446, and the FT-SE Mid 250, covering
a broader range of shares, rose 63.5 to an all-time high of 3,912.5.
As in the hectic trading during the run-up to Christmas, it was US buying of
London stock index futures which ignited the share market. However, prices
were often forced higher yesterday because the unwillingness of investors to
sell shares has left marketmakers very short of stock.
British government bonds were also sharply higher, gaining more than 3/4 of
a point as interest rate fears subsided.
However, south-east Asian markets tumbled for a second day as Kleinwort
Benson, the British securities house, added its voice to those downgrading
their view of Pacific Rim markets.
Earlier in the week, Japan's Nomura cut its weightings on Hong Kong, Kuala
Lumpur and Manila, preferring Tokyo instead. Morgan Stanley took the view
that equity markets had reached unsustainably optimistic levels and
recommended a shift from shares to cash.
Bangkok saw yesterday's biggest fall, plunging 5.5 per cent, while Kuala
Lumpur fell 4.6 per cent. Manila fell 4.1 per cent and Taiwan 3.9 per cent.
Hong Kong declined another 3.3 per cent in record turnover.

FT  07 JAN 94 / Gore reaches out to eastern European states
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Clinton administration is promising to remain engaged in Europe and to
fight for the success of democracy in former communist countries.
As President Bill Clinton prepares to fly tomorrow to Brussels, Prague and
then Moscow for meetings with leaders from the North Atlantic Treaty
Organisation and eastern Europe, vice-president Al Gore staunchly defended
the US's 'Partnership for Peace' proposal for bringing the countries of
eastern Europe into closer association with Nato.
Although many of these countries have complained that the proposal falls
short of the promise of eventual Nato membership which they seek, Mr Gore
said it represented an 'evolutionary process of Nato enlargement'.
'It is a step toward adding new members of Nato,' he said in a speech
delivered in Milwaukee in the place of Mr Clinton, who flew to Arkansas
following the death early yesterday morning of his mother, Mrs Virginia
Kelley.
Nato countries have been torn between the desire of countries such as Poland
and the Czech Republic for early entry into the alliance and Russia's
misgivings about being isolated by an expanded Nato. Mr Gore said Mr
Clinton's objectives on his 10-day trip to Europe would be to revive Nato,
support democracy, reduce the dangers of nuclear and chemical weapons and
help the transition to market economies in the former communist countries.
Mr Gore argued strongly that supporting the countries of eastern Europe was
an investment in US security.

FT  07 JAN 94 / Sud Marine yard in liquidation
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Sud Marine shipyard, one of the largest yards in the port of Marseilles,
was put into liquidation by a French judge yesterday, adding to the woes of
the economically depressed city.
The yard's 615 workers, who have been occupying the shipyard for the past 10
days to protest against the threatened closure, vowed to continue their
occupation to try to force the French government to rescue it.
The Sud Marine's future has hung in the balance since November when it went
into receivership.
Bouygues, the French construction company, was mooted as a possible rescuer.
But it failed to agree a deal with the government, and in the absence of any
other potential buyers, the authorities have liquidated the yard.
Mr Gerard Longuet, the French industry minister, said the Sud Marine was not
competitive in terms of pricing and performance.
Mr Robert Vigouroux, socialist mayor of Marseilles, blamed the shipyard's
demise on the long history of industrial unrest at the city's docks.
Liquidation of the Sud Marine is a bitter blow to Marseilles, which has
faced economic problems after years of industrial decline The city, once a
prosperous fulcrum for trade between France and its North African colonies,
has suffered severely from the dismantling of the French empire.
Marseilles' population over the past decade has fallen by 100,000, down to
800,000. The level of unemployment at 20 per cent is almost twice the
national average for France, rising to 30 per cent in the poorest areas of
the city.
The conservative French government has continued efforts initiated by the
previous socialist administration to try to make the docks more efficient by
modernising labour practices.
But the reforms have triggered a wave of strikes and stoppages by protesting
dock workers.

FT  07 JAN 94 / Sanctions put shoppers in front line: Yugoslavs are hunting
for food and petrol across the border
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'You went shopping in Hungary,' commented Mrs Mila Novakovic, peering from
her Belgrade flat at the dozen plastic bags piled on the staircase. 'How
much did that yellow cheese cost?' she demanded of her upstairs neighbour.
Mrs Novakovic, like most Serbs, currently is weighing up whether a day of
grocery shopping in the Hungarian frontier town of Szeged, about three hours
away from the Serbian capital, is worth paying the new DM10 (Dollars
5.75)tax to cross the Yugoslav frontier.
Strapped for cash, the Yugoslav federal government last week imposed the
exit tax for each Yugoslav citizen and DM30 per vehicle.
Government officials claimed the tax would help cover the costs of 'growing
humanitarian needs' in the face of the 'unjust economic sanctions' imposed
by the United Nations.
But critics called the tariff yet another government ploy to skim some of
the profits off the many black marketeers. They make daily runs across the
border, returning to Yugoslavia with a wide range of wares, from jerrycans
of petrol to cartons of cigarettes and medicines.
Since the UN imposed sanctions on Belgrade 19 months ago for its role in the
partition of Bosnia, smuggling has become one of the most profitable
pastimes in Serbia. Inhabitants of Yugoslav border towns have turned to the
sale of petrol.
But on a more mundane level, many Yugoslavs last year did their shopping
abroad. According to government estimates, some 2m people crossed the
frontier in November alone. Hyperinflation, chronic shortages and
unemployment left them little choice.
Hard-pressed to afford black market prices for milk, cheese, and staples
unavailable in Serbian stores, armed with long grocery lists and precious
hard currency, people wait in queues for up to 20 hours to enter Hungary,
Bulgaria, Romania or Macedonia, the former Yugoslav republic.
In Szeged, just 20km from the frontier, local shopkeepers grumble that Serbs
are buying up everything, in particular, coffee, milk and detergent. Until
the new tax, Szeged appeared a boom town. Shops were packed with Serbs and
ethnic Hungarians from the Vojvodina province of Serbia.
The Serbian economy has been devastated by financing nearly three years of
war and by the effects of sanctions.
Inflation in December ran at one million per cent. The average monthly wage
has dropped to the equivalent of DM4.
Most shops, except for a handful of state stores, accept only D-Marks,
spurning the decimated dinar, the Yugoslav national currency.
The National Bank last week chopped nine zeroes off the dinar, just two
months after the last six. Five hundred billion dinars became 500, which
yesterday was worth four pfennigs. In spite of the national mint working
overtime, dinars were all but impossible to find in the run-up to the
Orthodox Christmas celebration.
Back from shopping in Hungary, Yugoslav clerks at the exchange bank kindly
advised travellers to drive to the nearest town to convert their hard
currency into dinars at a local cafe at the unofficial rate. 'If we had
dinars, you would lose a lot of money - the rate here would be 50 per cent
below the street rate,' they said.
This week, after the exit tax was introduced, the motorway from the
Hungarian border to Belgrade was nearly deserted, except for the occasional
police checkpoints. Traffic has dwindled since the sanctions, which includes
an oil embargo.
Black marketeers were positioned along the road hawking cannisters of petrol
and diesel stacked on car roof racks in the shadows of the long January
night. Their earnings increased this week as petrol soared to DM4 per litre
in the New Year.
On the return trip, toll booth operators waved drivers through if they said
they had no dinars. The paltry toll of 500 dinars was evidently not worth
the bother. The few cars driving down the misty road were laden with bulky
packages of toilet paper, bottles of coca-cola, and sugar which, in many
cases, hid cannisters of petrol.
Looking over the rims of spectacles, Mrs Novakovic sighed about the high
price of salami in Belgrade. 'I never would have considered waiting for a
day to buy milk, but what else can I do?'
