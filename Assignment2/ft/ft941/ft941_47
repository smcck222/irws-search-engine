FT  07 JAN 94 / Paris plans savings market reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Edmond Alphandery, the French economy minister, yesterday confirmed that
he plans to table legislation for a radical reform of the Caisse des Depots
et Consignations, the state-controlled savings institution, writes Alice
Rawsthorn.
The reform of the Caisse des Depots, an idiosyncratic institution which
dominates the French savings system and is involved with public sector
funding, has been mooted since last March when Mr Edouard Balladur's
centre-right coalition government took office.
France's banks have lobbied for it to be dismantled in order to open up the
savings market. Mr Alphandery said he 'did not favour the dismemberment' of
the Caisse des Depots.
However, he said he felt that its public sector interests and competitive
activities should be separated.
The plan to reform the Caisse des Depots forms part of the Balladur
government's general economic programme of liberalising France's financial
institutions.
Other measures include the granting of independence to the Bank of France
and the privatisation of Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP) and Credit
Lyonnais, the main state-controlled banks.

FT  07 JAN 94 / Inflation down in Greece

   ATHENS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Greece's annual consumer price inflation rate fell to 12.1 per cent in 1993
and should be in line with the European Union average by 1997, Reuter
reports from Athens.
The inflation rate met government targets for 1993, and was down from 14.4
per cent in 1992.
Greece hopes to bring inflation to below 10 per cent by the end of this
year. This would be the first single-digit figure in 20 years.
The 1993 rate of 12.1 per cent is about three times the present EU average.
Mr Yannis Boutos, central bank governor, said yesterday Greece's biggest
problems were bringing deficits under control and fighting tax evasion.

FT  07 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: TV stocks active
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO and CLARE GASCOIGNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Media stocks were generally buoyant, with interest continuing on hopes that
the government review of the television sector would be sooner rather than
later.
But one casualty was Yorkshire-Tyne Tees TV, off 15 at 177p, after the
collapse of merger talks with LWT. An analyst said the difficulty of
divesting Tyne Tees could deter bids from other television companies.
The failure of the talks led one analyst to describe the hostile Pounds 670m
takeover of LWT by Granada as 'a fraction less than a foregone conclusion'.
LWT was up 22 at 648p and Granada added 14 at 553p.
Also affected was Anglia, as prospects of a bid for Tyne Tees receded and
rumours of a takeover by MAI, which controls Meridian, the south of England
franchise holder, revived. However, analysts said that Anglia was an
attractive proposition, and MAI may not be the only interested party; Anglia
shares were up 14 at 455p.
The firmer crude oil price led to strong buying activity for oil stocks.
Enterprise Oil put on 17 at 462p, with a Smith New Court recommendation said
to have also played a part in the day's advance.
Turnover in British Petroleum rose to 10m as the stock climbed 16 to 371p,
and Shell Transport was also heavily dealt, with volume reaching 4.4m as the
shares jumped 22 to 741p.
The sharp overnight retreat in the Hang Seng Index took its toll of several
Hong Kong related stocks. The day's casualties included banking group HSBC,
which relinquished 60 to 905p in trade of 6.8m shares, Cable and Wireless,
18 lighter at 504p, and Inchcape, which shed 3 to 551p.
Food retailers and manufacturers enjoyed a buoyant session as dealers
reported some switching out of the retailers and into two of the worst
performing market sectors of 1993.
Gains were made across the board. Among manufacturers, Cadbury-Schweppes
added 16 at 534p, Unigate 19 at 392p, Northern Foods 11 at 251p, United
Biscuits 13 at 372p, Dalgety 18 at 510p and Hillsdown 11 at 178p. Turnover
in supermarket operator Asda hit 49m as the shares firmed 1 3/4 to 62p. J.
Sainsbury climbed 13 to 461p, Tesco 9 1/2 to 231 1/2 p and Kwik Save 11 to
617p.
Lesiure stocks were also firm as investors sought recovery plays. Thorn EMI
was again a prominent feature as the shares followed Wednesday's rise of 21
with an advance of 33 to 1044p. Rank Organisation jumped 17 to 1031p, while
Compass Group put on 13 at 692p. News of record overseas holiday bookings
sent the tour operators forward, Airtours gaining 4 at 496p and Owners
Abroad 7 at 88p.
TSB remained in demand ahead of next week's results. The shares rose 6 to
247p.
Among composite insurers, a shortage of stock in Sun Alliance was credited
with the day's advance in the shares. They added 19 at 411p. General buying
in the sector saw Commercial Union finish 14 ahead at 661p. SG Warburg is
said to be positive on the stock.
In the insurance brokers, Willis Corroon stood out with an advance of 11 to
240p, boosted by a recommendation from Kleinwort Benson.
A broker's tip earlier this week continued to boost both TI Group and GKN.
Shares in the former appreciated 20 to finish at 431p, while the latter
moved ahead 13 to 560 1/2 p.
Henderson Crosthwaite was again a heavy buyer of Rolls-Royce shares, which
firmed 3 to 171p in strong volume of 8m.
Engineering group Siebe failed to capitalise on a positive presentation at
Kleinwort Benson as large lines of stock remained on offer. The shares
retreated 11 to 561p.
There was further profit-taking in the water sector. Hardest hit were
Anglian, down 20 at 549p. North West and Thames each declined 10 to 550p and
559p respectively, Southern lost 9 to 639p and Severn Trent dipped 8 to
583p. Mr Peter Hyde at Kleinwort Benson forecast continuing volatility until
the regulatory review in July. But for the longer term he remained
optimistic, with the prospect of outperformance towards the end of the year.
Among transport stocks, British Airways' December passenger figures, up 9
per cent, lifted the shares 7 to 464p.
Strong buying of Reuters from agency broker Henderson Crosthwaite sent the
shares sharply forward by 38 to 1823p in good volume of 2.3m. Analysts were
dismissive of bid rumours involving Reed International, down 10 at 894p.
Rackwood Mineral Holdings made an impressive debut. The shares closed 6
above the placing price at 46p.

FT  07 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Dixons shakes retailers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO and CLARE GASCOIGNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Worries over retail sales in the run-up to Christmas were confirmed
yesterday as electrical retailer Dixons revealed poor first-half results and
issued a profits warning.
Dixons shares dived on the news, which also sent shivers through the rest of
the stores sector and initially pushed several leading stocks down. By the
close, Dixons had plunged 43 to 240p, its biggest one-day fall since October
1987, with a hefty 13m shares traded.
With stores shares under pressure, there was growing expectations in the
market that other retailers would be forced into making Christmas trading
statements. Kingfisher was one widely tipped to make an announcement
shortly. The stock tumbled 15 to 747p as investors worried over its Comet
electrical division after Dixons warned that sales of computer games and
camcorders had been weak. Also hit were Argos, off 3 at 374p, GUS, down 9 at
628p, and Burton, 1 1/2 adrift at 68 1/2 p.
Analysts moved quickly to cut 1994 profits forecasts for Dixons. BZW reduced
its estimate by 15 per cent to Pounds 75m. Analyst Mr Tony Shiret said the
main concern was Dixons' weak gross margins, which appeared to be under
continuing pressure. UBS lowered its forecast back to Pounds 77m, while
Panmure Gordon pulled its figure down to Pounds 70m. For the following year,
the range was between Pounds 87m and Pounds 95m.
However, many other stores stocks later recovered as analysts digested the
detail of the Dixons results, much of which was deemed specific to the
group, and were then treated to improved figures from Boots. After being
down 18 at one stage, its shares recovered to close just 5 off at 582p. High
street clothes chains continued to be supported by market talk of better
December sales and firmer margins.

FT  07 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Another brisk day in the London derivatives markets saw unexpected support
from the US providing the opportunity for arbitrage trading in stock index
futures, writes Terry Byland.
Although well below the best at the close, the March contract on the
Footsie, at 3,424, was finally showing a premium of 20 points against cash,
and comfortably above the fair value premium estimated at 13 points. Volume
moved above 17,000 contracts after the official close of business.
After suffering heavily in early trading as London reacted to the overnight
fall in Hong Kong, futures were turned higher by the appearance of US
buyers, and at best the March contract touched 3,435, a premium of around 28
points to cash. Demand also came from the locals or independent traders, who
hinted at rate prospects despite the Bundesbank's refusal to budge.
Traded options were a little calmer, with 50,792 contracts done compared
with nearly 64,000 in the previous session. Business in the FT-SE contract
dipped to 9,801 from 14,165, and the Euro FT-SE recorded only 8,164.
Among the individual stocks, HSBC (2,590 contracts) reacted sharply to the
heavy fall in Hong Kong overnight. Food retailers traded actively, with
Sainsbury recording 1,216 deals and Tesco 4,397. Dixons (1,178) saw traders
reacting to the sharp fall in the shares following disappointing results.
Also busy were options in BTR as the market in the shares continued to take
hold of news that a senior board member had sold stock. Overall, the
preponderance of calls at 32,620 suggested an optimistic market.

FT  07 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: New York helps reverse early falls in
London - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The London stock market turned in a resilient performance yesterday, when
strength on Wall Street outweighed less encouraging factors on both the
domestic and international economic fronts. Trading volume remained heavy
and the second line stocks continued to attract attention. Once again, stock
index futures provided a lead as the equity market gyrated nervously.
The Bundesbank's decision to leave rates unchanged was not unexpected in
London. But it reinforced suggestions that the expected reduction in UK base
rates may be held back until the spring.
In early trading, a record close overnight in New York proved insufficient
to counter-balance a steep fall in Hong Kong and disappointing news on
Christmas trading from a leading UK high street retailer of electrical
goods. But further reports on the all-important Christmas season from the
retailing sector were more favourable, and an early loss of nearly 24 points
on the FT-SE 100 Index was swiftly reversed.
Institutions soon showed themselves unwilling to sell stock in the blue
chips and, driven forward by the March contract on the Footsie and by a
steadier trend in UK government bonds, share prices moved ahead sharply.
Second line issues also continued to attract buyers.
The Footsie 3,400 mark was soon recovered as the Index peaked for the day
above 3,407. Wall Street came in strongly again but London shaded off the
top as the Dow slipped back from its early day high to show an early gain of
6.47.
The final reading put the FT-SE 100 at 3,403, up 23.8. The FT-SE Mid 250
Index climbed 28.6 to a new closing peak of 3,849. The blue chip issues were
led forward by strong gains in leading oil stocks as investors looked for a
new meeting of the Opec countries this month which is expected to strive for
oil production cuts and higher crude prices.
But there were also strong rises among the brewers, food manufacturers and
leisure stocks, indicating that falls in these domestic sectors earlier this
week had been overdone. 'Investors are still unwilling to sell stocks,'
commented one leading dealer, 'and this is enough to keep share prices
solid.'
Seaq volume increased sharply to 1bn shares from Wednesday's 907.7m.
Although business in the Footsie listed issues was helped along by
arbitraging from the futures market, non-Footsie trading remained high,
making up around 63 per cent of the day's Seaq total.
The market, nervously wondering whether Christmas retail trade would bear
out predictions of economic recovery, was shaken in early deals by a gloomy
report from Dixons, the retail store. But the tone steadied after more
comforting news from Boots, also a high street retailer, and from Rhino
Group, the electronic games group.
Traders said the stock market was still somewhat uncertain, pointing to a
rash of bid speculation which threw up unlikely names including Reuters and
Fisons.
The derivatives markets have continued to cast a deep shadow over equities
this week, although there has not yet been any sign of further expiries of
over the counter share option (OTC) deals, which badly upset the stock
market at the end of last year. While views for the medium term remain
optimistic, some traders fear the effects of OTC deals in the near term.
Investors also appear cautious ahead of the January round of results from
leading British companies.

FT  07 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Hopes on growth take Dow over
3,800 level
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
Cyclical stocks lifted the bellwether Dow Jones Industrial Average above the
3,800 level for the first time yesterday, as investors gained confidence
from the likelihood of sustained low-inflationary growth, writes Frank
McGurty in New York.
By the close the Dow was 5.06 ahead at 3,803.88, a new record. But the more
broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was 0.43 easier at 467.12, reflecting a
nearly even split between advancing and declining issues. The American SE
composite edged 0.21 ahead to 479.00, while the Nasdaq composite was up 2.36
at 780.41.
Activity on the NYSE was hectic, pushed by a seasonal inflow of funds from
institutional investors. Some 368m shares were exchanged.
After ending at an all-time high the previous day, the market opened on a
positive note, buoyed by improved sentiment on inflation. Although stocks
moved in an opposite direction from bonds on Wednesday, investors were
pleased to see a rebound in the benchmark 30-year government issue, which
responded to favourable comments by Mr Robert Reich, the labor secretary.
Mr Reich said he expected that today's employment data would show lower
December job growth than the fixed-income markets had feared, suggesting
that concern over the pace of the economy's growth was overdone.
Retailing issues were among the most active, stimulated by the release of
December sales figures by the leading stores groups. Kmart dropped Dollars 1

FT  07 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei up again as Hong
Kong drops 6.5%

Share prices soared on active buying of high-technology stocks by overseas
investors, but later profit-taking by domestic corporations eroded some of
the gains and the Nikkei average closed just moderately higher, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue index gained 98.51 at 17,881.99, while the Topix index of all
first section stocks finished 6.42 ahead at 1,469.27.
The Nikkei recovered the 18,000 level briefly during the first hour of
trading, rising to a day's high of 18,027.70 on buying led by US and Asian
investors as the weakening of the yen supported hopes of better profits for
exporters.
Traders said that extra income from hedging against yen assets for European
investors, due to interest rate differentials, also encouraged buying by
foreign investors.
However, profit-taking came in from corporate investors and life insurers
which had supported share prices when the Nikkei was around 16,000 last
year. This has made 18,000 a strong resistance level on the upside, and the
index fell to a low of 17,792.58 in the final 30 minutes of the afternoon
session.
Mr Jason James, a strategist at James Capel, expects the Nikkei to make the
upward breakthrough in the next few months, as institutions start to shift
funds to the stock market due to low interest rates.
Volume totalled 350m shares, against 290m. Advances led declines by 626 to
422, with 125 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index added 2.16
at 1,220.95.
Cable and wire companies were higher on reports of an expected proposal by a
government advisory body to replace the current television broadcast system
with a next-generation optical fibre cable-based system.
Fujikura rose Y47 to Y811 and Mitsubishi Cable gained Y24 at Y753. Nippon
Telegraph and Telephone, which has advanced technology development for
next-generation systems, put on Y13,000 at Y779,000. NEC added Y14 at Y906
and Fujitsu Y4 at Y870.
Some foreign favourites fell on profit-taking, Sony by Y50 to Y5,790 and
Matsushita Electric Industrial by Y20 to Y1,530.
Financials, which have been weak on arbitrage selling, gained ground.
Industrial Bank of Japan rallied Y40 to Y2,900 and Nomura Securities moved
ahead Y40 to Y1,890.
In Osaka, the OSE average gained 163.45 at 19,755.21 in volume of 57.7m
shares.
Roundup
Aggressive profit-taking left Hong Kong and Kuala Lumpur sharply lower as
Nomura reduced their weightings in its model portfolio, although further
records were set elsewhere in the region.
HONG KONG encountered heavy profit-taking which sent shares tumbling and
stripped 6.5 per cent off the Hang Seng index.
The market indicator fell 793.43 to its low for the day at 11,374.50, the
largest single day's decline since the 1987 stock market crash.
Turnover was the third highest ever at a provisional HKDollars 13.07bn,
topped only by the two previous days' records.
However, the market's second consecutive daily fall caused little concern,
coming after last year's 115 per cent gain in the index, much of it in the
last quarter.
KUALA LUMPUR suffered its largest ever single day fall, tumbling 5 per cent
amid heavy profit-taking. The index, which had risen by 235 points over the
last fortnight, shed 65.77 to 1,248.69.
BANGKOK tumbled 2.4 per cent as institutions joined individuals in taking
profits among the big capitalisation stocks for the second straight day. The
SET index fell 41.70 to at 1,667.94 in near record high turnover of
Bt38.86bn.
SINGAPORE continued lower for the second consecutive day, the market losing
1.8 per cent as investors took profits aggressively. The Straits Times
Industrials index fell 43.73 to 2,388.26.
MANILA surged anew as foreign and domestic institutional demand emerged for
second liners, after Wednesday's correction. The Manila index climbed 62.16
to 3,293.33.
SEOUL was helped ahead by strong interest in blue-chips although financials
and low-priced shares lost ground. The composite index added 6.24 to a
record 893.17 in heavy volume.
AUSTRALIA saw a late revival in the resources sector which pushed the market
off its day's lows to yet another six year high.
The All Ordinaries index closed 6.9 higher at 2,200.3, a level it tested but
which it was unable to hold on Wednesday.
JAKARTA was mixed in active trading with stocks seemingly unaffected by
Indonesia's cautious budget announcement.
The JKSE market index turned back from Wednesday's four year high, losing
3.57 to 609.32.
BOMBAY picked up towards close, after a mild drop at mid-session, as buying
by Indian brokers and institutions continued on the last day of the current
account period. The BSE 30-share index closed up 52.80 at a record 3,506.88.
KARACHI posted a record close, the KSE 100 index adding 53.73 to 2,327.33 on
active foreign buying in multinationals and blue chips.
NEW ZEALAND nudged ahead the NZSE-40 Capital index rising 6.02 to 2,198.82
in good volume.

FT  07 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets: Taiwan hits another new high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TAIPEI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Taiwan's stock market fluctuated wildly yesterday before closing slightly up
at a new 3 1/2 -year high, Dennis Engbarth and Reuter report in Taipei.
Turnover, at TDollars 185.9bn, was the heaviest since February 1990.
Brokers were unsure whether the market, which surged in the final weeks of
1993 on a rise in political confidence, foreign capital inflows, and hopes
for direct sea links with China, was entering a correction. 'Everybody knows
the overheated market is due for a correction at some point, the question is
when,' said Mr Harris Liao of Harvest Securities.
Most analysts believe that the market will remain vibrant but mercurial in
early 1994, but that the momentum may fade in the second quarter due to
revived concern about politics and economic growth.
The December rally was sparked by the better than expected showing of the
ruling Kuomintang (KMT) in county and city mayoral elections in late
November.
The results encouraged the government to announce financial sector reforms,
including liberalisation of foreign capital entry and exit rules. A
ministerial commission proposed lifting restrictions on entry and
repatriation of capital. Officials decided to propose raising the 50 per
cent ratio of foreign investment permitted in the securities, banking and
insurance sectors.
The market received a further boost last week when Mr Chiang Ping-kun,
minister of economic affairs, said that he aimed to encourage port
authorities in Taiwan and mainland China to open nego-tiations on setting up
direct freight links in 1994.
Also last week came news that a new securities capital gains tax statute
would not significantly enlarge the tax liability of most investors.
Among factors aiding prospects in the next few months are a decline in
interest rates since August, availability of new funds from local investors,
and growth of corporate profits. Political concerns may return in the second
quarter as the National Assembly debates a proposal for direct presidential
elections and other constitutional revisions.
There are also some economic doubts. Growth is officially forecast at 6.2
per cent in 1994, compared with 6 per cent for 1993, but private sector
analysts doubt whether the official estimate of more than 8 per cent growth
in merchandise exports, compared with below 5 per cent in 1993, can be
realised.

FT  07 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Oil shares rise on higher
crude prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Several bourses were closed for the Epiphany holiday yesterday, writes Our
Markets Staff. The others were mostly higher, although the German
Bundesbank, as expected, left its key interest rates unchanged.
Around the Continent, oil shares rose on higher crude prices, reflecting
hopes that Opec will bring forward a meeting to discuss cuts in crude
output.
PARIS looked past yesterday's Buba decision, assuming instead that the
German central bank will cut rates in two weeks' time. This produced a
futures driven rally which took the CAC-40 index 25.51 higher to 2,275.06 in
turnover up from FFr5.4bn to FFr5.6bn.
Oils rose on the firmer crude price trend, Elf Aquitaine by FFr9.20 to
FFr426.50, Total by FFr4.50 to FFr323.20 and Elf Gabon, the pure production
play, by FFr98, or nearly 10 per cent, to FFr1,098.
Automotive stocks were encouraged by the economy minister, Mr Edmond
Alphandery's talk of aid for the industry, Peugeot rising FFr14 to FFr775,
Michelin by FFr3.30 to FFr214.30 and Valeo by FFr64 to FFr1,339.
Eurotunnel did big business with 6.66m shares traded as it rose another
FFr1.40 to FFr58.50, Euro Disney recovered another FFr1.85 to FFr33.50 and
Moulinex, the domestic appliances group, rose FFr9.30, or 8.9 per cent to
FFr114 on a broker's recommendation.
FRANKFURT's Dax index fell another 13.19 to 2,220.22, off an intraday low of
2,205.48, as the extent of Metallgesellschaft's problems hit the market, and
as the DIW economic research institute in Berlin said that the west German
economy was heading for a double-dip recession.
Turnover fell from DM10.8bn to DM8.2bn. This week's three-day fall was still
being classed as a correction, brokers noting that there was still buying
interest in selected issues like Preussag, weakened by the
Metallgesellschaft debacle which led to the latter's suspension yesterday,
but recovering another DM7 to DM466.50 for a two-day gain of DM15.
Shares in Metallgesellschaft's major banking partners, Deutsche and
Dresdner, fell DM10.50 to DM859, and DM9.80 to DM453 in a generally weak
sector.
AMSTERDAM remained at a record high after strong performances by some blue
chips and the ATX index rose 1.17 to 423.57. The market was also supported
by a heavy start-of-the-year flow of funds into equities and the strength of
the guilder.
Royal Dutch added Fl 5.60 to Fl 210.30 in response to the oil price
developments.
Akzo added Fl 6 to Fl 206 in continued response to the Wednesday's
presentation which reinforced analysts' expectations on the Nobel
acquisition. Philips added Fl 1.20 to Fl 43.30 amid speculation that it may
resume dividend payments this year.
ZURICH continued to move higher and the SMI index added 12.7 to a record
3,022.1.
Renewed demand emerged for Nestle as the share climbed above SFr1,300 and it
finished SFr17 higher at SFr1,315.
Zurich Insurance rose SFr25 to SFr1,588 on positive expectations for its
1993 results.
Adia, under pressure in recent months, continued to draw comfort from a
report that technical analysis points to a rise in the price. The shares
added SFr26 to SFr234.
BRUSSELS registered another record close as the national bank cut its key
central rate for money market lending by 0.15 percentage point to 7.10 per
cent, the Bel-20 index ending 4.44 higher at 1,489.41.
DUBLIN put on 2 per cent, the ISEQ overall index adding 39.01 to 1,972.08.
Mr Robbie Kelleher of Davy Stockbrokers in Dublin said that the market was
heartened by publication of government deficit figures earlier in the week
which pointed the way to the possibility of tax cuts in the budget at the
end of the month.
Smurfit rose 21p or 6.6 per cent to IPounds 3.39 helped by the strength of
paper stocks on Wall Street.
ISTANBUL forgot new tax incentives for investments in bonds and currency,
cash flowed back into equities and the market rose 3.7 per cent to a new
high, the composite index ending a provision 812.76 higher at 22,929.1.

FT  07 JAN 94 / Markets Report: Bundesbank delays cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The D-Mark dominated money market attention yesterday, after the Bundesbank
decided against cutting German interest rates, writes Gillian Tett.
With the markets convinced that cuts have only been delayed, rather than
abandoned, the move failed to boost the German currency. And in spite of the
Bundesbank's attempt to stabilise the German money markets with a fixed repo
rate, these seem set to remain volatile in the coming weeks.
The Bundesbank's decision to leave its discount and Lombard rates unchanged
at 5.75 per cent and 6.75 per cent respectively had been widely predicted,
and in spite of the recent weakening of the D-Mark against the dollar there
were no dramatic currency moves yesterday.
After the announcement, the D-Mark firmed against the dollar to end at
DM1.7397, but was still slightly down from the previous day's close. In New
York it finished at DM1.7445. Further movement seems set to be dollar rather
than D-Mark led, with the publication of US non-farm payroll figures today.
The more surprising announcement was the Bundesbank's decision to retain a
fixed repo rate of 6.00 per cent for two weeks - a move which underlined the
problems that German money market volatility is now posing. Indeed, Ms
Alison Cottrell of Midland Global Markets believes concern about this
volatility, rather than D-Mark weakness, may have guided the Bundesbank's
decision yesterday.
The volatility primarily stems from the gradual abolition of the 'Chapter
17' practices on German money markets, which previously allowed the
Bundesbank to use government funds deposited with it to provide temporary
liquidity for the markets. In exchange, government institutions enjoyed
favourable overdraft facilities. But new European regulations abolished
these facilities six days ago, depriving the Bundesbank of a key source of
liquidity.
The freeing of these funds has fuelled market volatility. With the market
confident that German rates will fall soon, there is strong downward
pressure on money market rates. Three-month money was yesterday priced at
5.81 per cent.
If the Bundesbank had left the repo rate variable, it could have fallen
below the discount rate, Keith Edmonds, chief analyst at IBJ International,
pointed out.
But Ms Cottrell believes that the Bundesbank's decision to fix the repo rate
only until the next council meeting on January 20 has 'left it in a hole'.
'Money market rates could fall below the discount rate or even go up to 7
per cent, particularly towards the end of the month,' said Ms Cottrell, who
believes the instability could continue into February.
As a sign of the scepticism generated by the Bundesbank's decision, the
D-Mark dipped against many European currencies yesterday, although the
Netherlands and Belgium joined Austria and Denmark in reducing their own
rates in spite of Germany.
The Belgian franc firmed slightly against the D-Mark, to Bfr20.70 from a
previous Bfr 20.75 after Belgium's central bank cut its central rate to 7.10
per cent from 7.25 per cent.
In Denmark, the Danish central bank lowered its 14-day repo rate to 6.50 per
cent from 6.75, following its  1/4 percentage point cut in its discount and
deposit rates on Wednesday. The kroner ended unchanged at DM0.2576. The
Dutch guilder also remained firm against the D-Mark after the Dutch central
bank cut its Lombard special advances rate to 5.5 per cent from 5.6 per
cent.
Meanwhile the French franc strengthened against the D-Mark to FFr3.3933 from
FFr3.3952 in the morning after the Bundesbank's decision. It later softened
to FFr3.396.
The move came after the Bank of France announced that its intervention rate
for securities repurchase tender would remain at 6.20 per cent, the level
ruling since December 3.
It announced that it had drained a net FFr40bn from the money market.
One currency that the D-Mark did gain strongly against yesterday was the
beleaguered Spanish peseta, which weakened to Pta83.51 per D-Mark, from
Pta83.13 at the previous day's close.
The peseta's fall is noteworthy since it has now broken ranks with the other
'high yielding' currency, the Ita-lian lira, said Mr Avinash Persaud,
currency analyst at JP Morgan.
Unlike the lira, which has risen in recent days, the peseta is unlikely to
improve until the Bundesbank eases pressure on the Spanish currency by
cutting German rates, he thinks. 'The fiscal and banking problems developing
in Spain now are of a considerably worse order than elsewhere in Europe,' he
added.
A report published by the Spanish Economic and Social Council yesterday
predicted only modest signs of recovery in Spain this year, and bleak
prospects for cutting the budget deficit and unemployment. Reports that the
Bank of Spain will meet leading Spanish bank chairmen to discuss the Banco
Espanol de Credito-Banesto further unsettled markets.
Sterling briefly touched a six-month high against the D-Mark yesterday, of
DM2.5903, though it finished at DM2.5886.
The Bank of England forecast a shortage of Pounds 1.6bn in its daily money
market operations, before removing most of this by purchasing bills at 5 5/8
per cent.

FT  07 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gold market surrenders its new
year gains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Gold's price yesterday lost all the gains it had made since the begining of
the new year as computer programmes used by some US institutional investors
sent out 'sell' signals.
In London the price dropped to Dollars 385 a troy ounce at one stage before
recovering slightly to close at Dollars 388.75, down Dollars 7.75.
Some analysts suggested the drop merely represented a badly-needed pause for
breath before gold and other precious metals continued their upward climb
towards key levels: Dollars 400 for gold and Dollars 5.30 an ounce for
silver. However, Mr Ted Arnold, analyst at the Merrill Lynch financial
services group, warned that 'physical demand for gold is dropping like a
stone' at recent price levels. 'The higher gold prices go the more physical
offtake is likely to fall in both Asia and the Middle East.'
Mr Arnold said Saudi Arabians had been big buyers of gold and silver in the
past few months as a hedge against possible devaluation of their currency.
That threat had eased and 'much of this gold and silver is now showing a
good profit and is likely to be disinvested at higher price levels'.
Silver, which led the precious metals up and then down again this month,
closed in London last night down 17 cents an ounce at Dollars 5.07. However,
by mid-day in New York it was rising again. Some traders said this was
because it had earlier held above a key support level: Dollars 4.96 an
ounce.
One trader told Reuter that two investment funds that liquidated their
positions in the gold futures market did not have silver positions.

FT  07 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Aluminium problems hit Jamaican
bauxite earnings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KINGSTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Jamaica's 1993 bauxite production slipped by just under one per cent to
11.2m tonnes because of weak demand and the flatness of the aluminium
market.
There was, however, a 2.8 per cent rise in production of alumina (aluminium
oxide) to 2.98m tonnes, while exports of crude ore fell 1.4 per cent to
4.07m tonnes.
Jamaica is the world's third largest bauxite producer, after Australia and
Guinea, and the island's earnings from the industry, which are pegged to
international prices for aluminium, fell to Dollars 529m last year, Dollars
48m less than in 1992.
Mr Parris Lyew-Ayee, acting managing director of the institute, said that
Jamaica, like other bauxite producers, was suffering from the weak state of
the world aluminium industry, 'a high level of output of primary aluminium
in all the producing countries, and the reluctance of producers to curtail
production to correct the oversupply'.

FT  07 JAN 94 / World Commodities Prices: Wool
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Although there will ne no auction test of world wool values till next week,
the market in the UK and other consuming countries is coming back to life
after the holidays.  Deliveries are going out reasonably well, and there is
some buying interest from Continental Europe.  Prices in several currencies
are tending dearer because the US dollar has been a little stronger, and the
Australian dollar has improved against the US. With prices likely to tend
dearer even if wool is unchanged in dollar terms, precautionary covering is
indicated by some traders, and selling prices for wool tops are slightly
higher.

FT  07 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Steichen says no more farm
reform needed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Union will need to make no further adjustments to its reforms
of its common agricultural policy provided that member countries stick to
the schedule already agreed for changes, which runs until 1996, Mr Rene
Steichen, the union's agriculture commissioner said yesterday.
Speaking at the Oxford Farming Conference, Mr Steichen said: 'There are good
reasons to hope that we can erode current cereal stocks by rising internal
consumption and the increase in subsidised exports allowed under last-minute
changes to the Blair House deal'.
He said that no further CAP reforms for the arable sector would be necessary
to fit in with the recent settlement in the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade. The modifications to the Blair House accord, which were made to quell
French objections to the Gatt deal, will allow the EU to export an
additional 8.1m tonnes of wheat and flour over the six years from 1995. That
represented about a third of current stocks of between 23m and 25m tonnes,
Mr Steichen said.
In addition, he pointed to a rise in the consumption of wheat for animal
feed within the EU. This is expected to grow by 4m to 5m tonnes in the
latest marketing year and looks set to rise by 11m tonnes a year within two
to three years.
Nevertheless, cereals stocks were still 'alarmingly high,' and the community
had some way to go in getting rid of them, the commissioner stressed.
He pointed to the crucial role played by the unpopular acreage set-aside
programme in the reform of the arable sector. 'I appreciate and sympathise
with the concerns of farmers on set-aside,' he admitted. But he claimed that
decisions taken at the last council meeting in December to enable farmers to
opt voluntarily to set-aside larger portions of their land than the
compulsory 15 per cent would make the programme more acceptable to producers
and society.
'This could mean that there will be a tendency towards lower set-aside
requirements rather than an increase after 1996.'
Mr Steichen insisted that CAP reform was compatible with the Gatt agreement
as long as member countries implemented the reforms strictly.
He said that the modifications to the Blair House deal, as well as
increasing the amount of subsidised wheat exports over six years, would see
the EU exporting an additional 362,000 tonnes of cheap beef - 65 per cent of
the EU's stockpile - 253,000 tonnes of poultry and 102,000 tonnes of peas.
Although the overall picture of CAP reform was positive, Mr Steichen
stressed that reform of the beef sector was urgently needed 'before an
emergency situation arises'. Beef stocks had recently become more balanced -
falling from 1m tonnes to about 500,000 tonnes - but that was the result of
the production cycle rather than reform.
'In 1 to 2 years we will be facing an imbalance caused by overproduction
again,' he warned.

<TEXT>
The Chicago Board of Trade, hoping to cash in on the recently boisterous
performance of the lumber market, will introduce on 25 January futures on an
index of structural panel prices. The contract, a revamp of the exchange's
old plywood futures contract, will be based on an index of prices for US
southern yellow pine plywood and oriented strand board. It will be settled
in cash, rather than with physical delivery.
Structural panels are used extensively in US home building, an area of the
US economy that has begun to rebound. The structural panel index will
reflect forest product prices in the south and eastern US.

FT  07 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Washington holds key to Cuba's
farming future - Agricultural exports could blossom if the US lifted its
embargo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cuban agriculture could become a significant force on markets, including the
US, if Washington's trade embargo on the Caribbean island was lifted,
according to a group of experts that discussed the island's agriculture at a
recent conference in Miami on Central American and Caribbean trade.
It also concluded, however, that it would take the country many years after
the ending of an embargo to adjust to a global market very different from
that which prevailed at the time of the 1959 revolution.
It was also thought unlikely that the island republic would be able to
regain any of the significant markets it lost, as these had been taken over
by other producers who would not easily be dislodged.
'Cuba has not been sitting still in agriculture despite the many setbacks,'
said Mr John Lamb, associate director for international trade of Chemonics
International of the US. 'The sector employs 19 per cent of the country's
workers and accounts for 75 per cent of its foreign earnings.' The changes
to Cuba's agriculture that were implemented by the government last September
were intended to deal with current problems of production shortfalls, and
did not seek to lift production to find new markets, the experts concluded.
The Cuban government has allowed increased private participation in
agriculture with the establishment of new co-operative farms and
individually-run farms - but these still operate within the framework of the
state's continuing control of the economy.
The sugar industry, the main pillar of Cuban agriculture, would face some
difficulty in regaining markets even if the embargo was lifted, Mr Lamb
said. He noted that before the 1959 revolution, Cuba had a half of the US
sugar market at a time when US cane sugar imports were about 6m tonnes a
year. But US cane sugar consumption was now only about 3m tonnes a year.
The experts reasoned that, if the trade embargo ended, Cuba could be
attractive to US investors in agriculture wanting an offshore location. Mr
Lamb said the island had good soil and flat land, adequate water, a large,
trained labour force, minimal pest problems, good ports and a sound internal
transportation infrastructure.
The Cuban citrus industry was supported by an extensive research system,
said Mr Gene Albrigo, a horticulturalist with the Citrus Research and
Education Centre of the University of Florida. 'Over 60 per cent of the
trees are under 15 years old. There are adequate facilities in the packing
houses, of which there are 25, with two more being built.
The industry has several forms of joint agreements with Chilean, British,
Spanish, Israeli and Greek companies.' Cuba's impact on the US or other
markets would not be immediate if the embargo was lifted, the experts
concluded. They expected that first efforts would be for an expansion of
domestic food crops for local consumption, and a rehabilitation of the sugar
industry because of its importance to the national economy. It would also
take some time for the expected disputes over land tenure and land ownership
to be resolved.
The US government has warned prospective foreign investors in Cuba not to
become involved with property that was seized by the government and could be
the subject of legal disputes if and when there is a change of government in
the island.
'Salinity is also a very big and growing problem,' reported Mr Albrigo.
'This has reached a crisis in some parts of the coast and across the centre
of the island. If this continues it will be a disaster, particularly for
fruit and vegetables.'
In addition to expanded production of the traditional commodities (sugar,
citrus, coffee, tobacco) to satisfy a new market, Cuba has the potential to
become an important source of horticultural products for North America. Some
participants in the conference concluded that this was an area of the
island's agriculture that could bloom in a post-embargo Cuba.
'Cuba was once a major exporter of vegetables, but the market has been taken
over by Mexico since the embargo,' said Mr Lamb. 'Cuban access to the US
market in the future will have an adverse impact on producers in the
Caribbean, Central America, Mexico and Florida, especially in the production
of vegetables and horticulture.'
Mr Carlos Balerdi, a tropical fruit crops agent in the agricultural
extension service of Dade County, Florida, thought that one major hurdle for
Cuban agriculture if and when the embargo was lifted could be psychological.
'One problem is that agricultural work has been used as a penalty for
dissidents and those trying to leave the island,' he said. 'This may cause a
very negative psychological reaction to agriculture in a future Cuba.'

FT  07 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: India seen making heavy sugar
imports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BOMBAY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
India will have to import up to 500,000 tonnes of sugar in 1993-94 to meet
its growing consumption, according to the Centre for Monitoring the Indian
Economy, reports Reuter from Bombay.
CMIE, a privately-funded research body, estimated the season's opening sugar
stock at 3.3m tonnes and production at 11.5m tonnes, against a domestic
consumption of 12.2m.
'However, about 500,000 tonnes of sugar would have to be imported during the
year to maintain a healthy year-end stock level,' the centre said.
It suggested that the government might also allow more imports of raw sugar
for refining and re-export. The commerce ministry had allowed an import of
50,000 tonnes of raw sugar last month for re-export after refining.
'More imports may be allowed after evaluating the impact of the initial flow
in the domestic markets,' CMIE said.
The government had agreed to imports of raw sugar after the sugar industry
suggested the idea to maintain its presence in the market, where prices had
been on the rise. According to the CMIE, domestic sugar prices in December
were 7 per cent higher than in November and 37 per cent higher than in
December 1992. But sugar industry oficials said the Indian Sugar Industry
Export Corporation, the private sector agency authorised to import raw
sugar, had not bought any because of high international prices.
'At the moment we have not gone for any purchases. We have not applied our
mind to the proposal,' said Mr SL Jain of the Indian Sugar Mills'
Association. 'The present international price situation of raw sugar and
white sugar is not compatible with the government policy on value addition.'

FT  07 JAN 94 / International Capital Markets: UK new issue volume shows big
increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
New issue activity in the UK increased dramatically last year, with a total
of Pounds 19.63bn raised, up 78 per cent on the 1992 total of Pounds
11.03bn, according to figures compiled by IFR Securities Data.
Last year saw a big rise in the number and volume of rights issues in the
UK, with Zeneca, the bioscience group which was demerged from Imperial
Chemical Industries at the beginning of June, responsible for the largest
cash call of Pounds 1.35bn.
Some Pounds 11.56bn was raised from rights issues last year, compared with
Pounds 3.75bn the previous year, and rights issues accounted for 59 per cent
of all new issues in 1993.
Apart from Zeneca, other substantial cash calls came from British Airways,
which raised Pounds 454.4m; Commercial Union (Pounds 438m); Scottish &amp;
Newcastle (Pounds 416m); and Royal Insurance (Pounds 413.5m).
SG Warburg maintained its position at the top of the UK underwriting league
table, helped by its lead role in the Zeneca issue.
According to IFR Securities Data, SG Warburg's underwriting activity
encompassed 60 issues totalling Pounds 3.17bn, and included substantial
deals by MB Caradon (Pounds 347m), Siebe (Pounds 188.5m) and Burton Group
(Pounds 168m).
Morgan Grenfell climbed from 10th to second position last year, helped by
its role in the cash calls from Scottish &amp; Newcastle, Asda, Bowater, and
MEPC.
'1994 has a tough act to follow. However, with continued low levels of
inflation and interest rates, the underlying indicators are that it could be
another prosperous year for new issues,' says IFR Securities Data.

FT  07 JAN 94 / Government Bonds: Jobs data help Treasuries rebound
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY and CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US Treasury bonds rebounded yesterday after Mr Robert Reich, labor
secretary, said today's employment data would show fewer jobs in December
had been created than the market had feared.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was ahead at 98 21/32
, with the yield slipping to 6.346 per cent. At the short end, the two-year
note was  1/8 higher at 100 1/32 , to yield 4.216 per cent.
Mr Reich said he expected non-farm payrolls to have risen last month by
160,000 to 200,000, below the consensus forecast of 225,000. His remarks
eased the market's concern over the pace of economic acceleration, although
the effect was undermined when Mr Reich added that he had not seen the
report.
In another development, the Labor Department said initial claims for
unemployment benefit had increased by 70,000 in the last week of 1993, after
a 39,000 decline the previous week. Although the data were distorted by
seasonal factors, the market interpreted the increase as a sign that recent
anxiety over inflation may have been premature.
The recent sell-off in Europe's bond markets came to a halt yesterday,
helped by the firmer tone in US Treasuries. Trading was thin, however, with
markets in Spain, Italy, Sweden, Finland, Austria and parts of Germany
closed for the Epiphany holiday.
The Bundesbank's decision to leave its key interest rates unchanged caused
the German yield curve to flatten slightly as market participants trimmed
their hopes for a cut in interest rates soon.
At its first meeting this year, the central bank council held its discount
rate at 5.75 per cent and its Lombard rate at 6.75 per cent, and announced
another two rounds of securities repurchase agreements at a fixed rate of 6
per cent. This continues a policy begun on December 2, when the bank set a
five-week series of 6 per cent repos.
The long end of the bund market firmed as traders covered speculative short
positions while medium maturities weakened slightly. The March bund futures
contract ended at 100.79, down 0.05 point.
The strength of their currencies against the D-Mark enabled the Belgian and
Dutch central banks to cut their interest rates, giving a slight lift to
both countries' bond markets.
Belgium lowered its key central rate by 15 basis points to 7.10 per cent,
and cut its overnight and emergency lending rates by 25 basis points to 8.70
per cent and 11.25 per cent, respectively.
The Netherlands cut its special advances rate by 10 basis points to 5.5 per
cent and its secured advances rate by 25 basis points to 5.25 per cent.
French government bonds ended the day slightly lower after the market
digested a total of FFr20.24bn in new long-dated bonds. The FFr15.67bn of
5.5 per cent 10-year OAT's met with more investor demand than the FFr4.57bn
of 8.5 per cent 30-year bonds, traders said.
The March notional futures contract on Matif ended at 130.32, down 0.06.
UK gilts ended a quiet day little changed, with the yield curve flattening
slightly after the Bundesbank left rates unchanged. Flows were thin, with
investors reluctant to take fresh positions ahead of a raft of data due to
be released from next week. The March long gilt futures contract rose  5/32
to 118 29/32 .
Japanese government bonds had a strong day, boosted by the successful
auction of Y1,000bn 3.4 per cent 10-year bonds and a short-squeeze in the
futures pits. The March JGB futures contract rose 0.48 point at 117.68.

The Eurodollar sector saw plenty of activity yesterday, with new issues from
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph and the Canadian Wheat Board.
At the same time, market participants were also anxious to see how Abbey
National's previously-announced Dollars 1bn three-year deal performed after
it broke syndicate yesterday morning.
AT&amp;T launched a Dollars 400m, five-year deal which was priced to yield 25
basis points over the relevant US Treasury bond.
CS First Boston, the lead manager, said that the deal had met good demand,
adding that retail interest should be strong given the familiarity of the
AT&amp;T name.
'AT&amp;T doesn't trade on its credit rating (which is AA3/AA) but on its name,'
said one syndicate official.
The rally in the US Treasury bond market yesterday helped to support the
issue.
By mid-afternoon the bonds were trading at 99.80-99.85, up from the re-offer
price of 99.595 and maintaining their yield spread over the US Treasury
bond.
Among the other Eurodollar issues, Abbey National's large, three-year deal
broke syndicate yesterday.
The spread over the US Treasury bond widened to 34 1/2 basis points from 32
basis points, according to one of the lead managers.
Other syndicates said that they had quoted slightly wider spreads and argued
that there was insufficient demand for such a big deal.
With the abolition of the 'three-month lock-up rule' for sovereign Euroyen
issues at the start of this year, the international bond market has seen a
surge of activity in the Euroyen sector this week.
Yesterday saw the launch of a 15-year Euroyen issue for Republic of Austria,
which is a triple-A rated borrower.
Goldman Sachs, one of the joint bookrunners, said that by tapping this
maturity, Austria had launched a 'pioneering deal', given the absence of
such long-dated non-JGB issues.
Syndicate officials said that the deal had met good demand from both Europe
and Japan.
Investors were said to be looking for appreciation of the yen and the
prospect of a further rally in the Japanese bond market, in view of the weak
state of the Japanese economy and the need for a further cut in interest
rates.
The bonds were priced to yield 65 basis points over the 10-year JGB, giving
an annual yield of 3.82 per cent. However, by late afternoon the price had
fallen to 99.02-99.07 from 99.21 at issue.
In the sterling floating rate sector, Ford Credit Europe launched its second
issue - a Pounds 100m deal with a five-year maturity and a coupon of
three-month London interbank offered rate plus 25 basis points.
Syndicate officials predict that investors will start to move more
aggressively into sterling floating rate issues as the potential for further
cuts in the UK base rate appears to lessen.
Mr Simon Best of Baring Brothers, lead manager for the issue, believes that
the sterling floating rate area will prove interesting this year for two
reasons: about Pounds 1.7bn of building society paper is due to reach
maturity in 1994, and there is a lot of paper with a 5 per cent floor that
is at risk of being called.
The Ford Credit Europe deal provides investors with a pick-up in yield of
between five and seven basis points over building society paper of a
comparable maturity and credit rating, according to Baring Brothers.
Hydro-Quebec, one of Canada's two biggest electric power utilities, plans a
CDollars 1bn global public offering of 10-year bonds to be distributed in
Canada, the US, Europe and Asia by an international underwriting group,
writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal.
The paper will be guaranteed by the Province of Quebec and registered with
the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Merrill Lynch and ScotiaMcLeod
will be joint managers of the issue, with Levesque Beaubien Geoffrion, Wood
Gundy and Yamaichi International (Europe) as co-leads.
Terms for the issue are expected to be set by January 15, depending on
market conditions.
Nearly half of the issue is expected to be sold in Canada. The utility's net
new debt issues this year will total around CDollars 3.25bn.
Calex, a Slovak state-owned producer of refrigerators and freezers, has
launched a Dollars 21m, three-year issue, marking the first time that a
Slovak company has issued a corporate bond in the international market, Sara
Webb adds.
The bonds, which have a coupon of 7 7/8 per cent, were priced to yield 325
basis points over the three-year US Treasury bond.
Nomura, which lead managed the deal, said that the proceeds would be used to
complete the financing of a new production line for ozone-friendly
compressors and insulation equipment.
The bonds are guaranteed by the government.

FT  07 JAN 94 / International Company News: Delta launches legal challenge
over routes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Delta Air Lines, the US carrier, yesterday launched a court challenge to the
US government's rejection of its application for one of two new routes
between the US and London.
The US department of transportation last month decided to award both routes
to American Airlines for services from Nashville, Tennessee, and
Raleigh/Durham, North Carolina.
The routes became available because of a requirement that US Air should give
up its London routes after British Airways, the UK flag carrier, took a
stake in the company.
Delta contested the department's decision, in a petition filed with the
District of Columbia appeal court, on the grounds that American Airlines has
the most routes to the UK. It says the decision runs counter to the
department's policy of promoting geographical balance and diversity of
services, promoting new non-stop services in under-served areas, and
promoting greater competition.
Delta wants to introduce a route between London and Salt Lake City, Utah. It
says this would be convenient to more passengers, provide London services to
more US cities, and generate more US-London passengers than Nashville or
Raleigh/Durham.
Mr Ron Allen, Delta's chairman and chief executive, said the evidence
favouring Salt Lake City was clear and compelling.
Northwest Airlines, the US carrier in which KLM Royal Dutch Airlines owns a
49 per cent stake, is expected to file its plans for an initial public
offering with the US Securities and Exchange Commission next week.

short-haul costs

<TEXT>
USAir, the lossmaking carrier in which British Airways holds a minority
stake, yesterday announced the first phase of a plan to cut operating costs
in its domestic short-haul market this summer.
It is to improve productivity and make better use of its assets by heavily
reducing the amount of time its aircraft spend on the ground between
flights, initially on 18 routes between US city pairs.
Turnround times will be cut from the current average of about 45 minutes to
about 25 minutes through a number of efficiency improvements: for example,
getting cleaners on to the aircraft while passengers are still disembarking,
and tightening check-in procedures to make sure that flights leave on time.
USAir said the changes would allow it to raise the number of departures per
aircraft from 6.9 a day to 8.4 on the 18 selected routes, increasing total
daily departures from 152 to 184. The aim, it said, was to increase
passenger numbers without increasing staff or other costs. It is not
planning an accompanying cut in fares.
The airline's move comes as large US carriers face increasing competitive
pressure from small airlines which have seized market share by offering
low-cost, no-frills services on short-haul US routes.
USAir turned in net losses of Dollars 178m in last year's third quarter, the
worst result of any of the big larger US carriers, the rest of which
reported profits.

software venture
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hewlett-Packard, a leading US electronics manufacturer, is to take a 15 per
cent equity stake in Taligent, a joint venture between International
Business Machines and Apple Computer. The value of the deal will not be
revealed.
Taligent, formed in March 1992, is developing advanced computer software
which IBM and Apple hope will be used to operate the next generation of
personal computers and workstations.
More than 90 per cent of personal computers use operating systems developed
by Microsoft of the US, the world's largest software house.
The involvement of HP, which unlike IBM has successfully maintained
profitability throughout the recession, gives fresh weight and credibility
to the Taligent venture.
Mr Bernard Guidon, HP's computer systems director for Europe, said yesterday
the company would work with Taligent to develop its 'object-oriented'
technology.
Object technology - in which programs are constructed from re-usable
software components - is seen as an important solution for companies
developing new software and replacing obsolete programs.
Mr Guidon said HP would run Taligent's software on its own computers and
would supply Taligent with its distributed computing technology. Distributed
computing expertise is essential for companies attempting to build
enterprise-wide networks.

<TEXT>
Asahi Breweries and Itochu, the Japanese trading house, are to take stakes
in three eastern Chinese breweries. Their plan is to tap the country's
rapidly expanding beer market.
The two companies will pay an estimated Dollars 35m for a combined 75 per
cent share in CSI Brewery, established by the Hong Kong-based China
Strategic Investment Limited.
CSI Brewery has a 55 per cent stake in Hangzhou Zhongce Beer, a 60 per cent
stake in Quanzhou CSI Beer, and a 55 per cent stake in Jiaxing, a brewery
linked to Hangzhou Zhongce.
Asahi intends to transfer technology to the three Chinese companies to
develop their homegrown brands. It also wants to produce its best-known
Japanese beer, Super Dry, in China, believing economic growth will stimulate
demand for quality brews.
The two Japanese companies said that although China was the third-largest
beer market, per capita annual consumption was only seven litres, compared
with 53 litres in Japan. They thought the eastern Chinese market appeared to
be the most lucrative.
However, Suntory, another Japanese brewer, was attracted by similar
statistics in 1984, when it began a joint venture in the eastern port city
of Lianyungang.
After a decade of fine-tuning and management changes at the Chinese partner,
Suntory has began to profit from the venture. Sales, however, are
concentrated in the area around the brewery.

Korean company

<TEXT>
General Electric said yesterday it had won a court order from a US judge
banning South Korea's Iljin Corporation from the commercial manufacture of a
type of industrial diamond for seven years. The ruling also demands the
destruction of its equipment for making the stones.
The injunction by Judge Nathaniel Gorton, a US district judge in Boston,
follows a ruling by a federal jury in the city last summer that Iljin had
misappropriated and used trade secrets stolen from GE.
GE, which invented the technique for manufacturing synthetic diamonds in the
1950s, had been fighting the case since 1989, when it alleged the technology
being used by the Korean firm had been purchased from a former GE employee
and was stolen.
The diamonds involved in the suit are 'saw grade' - a type used in cutting
and grinding applications.
Iljin will have 30 days to return to GE or destroy all documents and
equipment related to GE trade secrets.
Analysts noted that Iljin carried out business with the US, so failure to
comply with the order could carry the risk of court-ordered trade sanctions.

FT  07 JAN 94 / International Company News: Rothmans' Asian plans go up in
smoke - The UK tobacco group's expansion strategy has been scuppered
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A few cigarettes are being anxiously smoked in the boardroom of Rothmans
these days.
Last weekend a group of shareholders in Malaysia blocked ambitious plans by
the British tobacco group for an assault on the Chinese and Japanese
cigarette markets.
The move, which is being closely watched by companies considering a regional
structure for their Asian operations, was unexpected.
'It was like a bolt out of the blue,' says Mr Robert Fletcher, director of
public affairs at Rothmans Asia headquarters in Hong Kong. 'Now we have to
go back to the drawing board and consider what other options are open to
us.'
From a corporate point of view, the strategy behind a grand Asia plan
unveiled last February seemed clear enough.
Rothmans, like other tobacco companies, was facing stagnant or declining
sales in most western markets.
Increased access to the market in China, where some 1,700bn cigarettes - or
about a third of total global consumption - are puffed each year, is
considered vital to corporate profitability.
Cigarette consumption in China is going up by about 4 per cent each year,
and increasing affluence is lifting demand for foreign brands. Nevertheless,
sales by overseas companies run at only about 10bn cigarettes per year.
Japan and South Korea are other big markets where Rothmans wants to increase
sales.
The penetration of such markets demands a high level of marketing and
distribution expenditure.
The Rothmans plan called for the merger of Rothmans' locally-quoted units in
Malaysia and Singapore with the conglomerate's north-east Asia operations.
The new company, to be quoted in Hong Kong, Kuala Lumpur and Singapore,
would be 50 per cent-owned by Rothmans International, with the rest split
between shareholders in Malaysia and Singapore.
The merged company would have the necessary financial muscle and marketing
expertise to make an all-out assault on the China and Japan markets.
Manufacturing capacity at factories in Malaysia and Singapore would
complement operations at a joint venture concern recently set up in China.
Everyone, said Rothmans, would benefit in the long term.
Rothmans Singapore gave its full backing to the merger plan, but Rothmans
(Malaysia) was the key to the whole enterprise.
While Rothmans operations in north-east Asia continue to lose money, mainly
because of high marketing expenditures, the Malaysian operation is the jewel
in the Rothmans Asia crown.
Pre-tax profits in the year to March 31 1993 at Rothmans (Malaysia) were
MDollars 347.7m (USDollars 139m), and pre-tax profits for the six months to
September 1993 MDollars 191m. The Malaysian company is also said to be
sitting on cash reserves of more than MDollars 700m.
Although Rothmans International has a 50 per cent stake in Rothmans
(Malaysia), it refrained from exercising voting rights on the merger plan.
More than 90 per cent of the remaining stock in the Malaysian company is
controlled by Permodalan Nasional (PNB), a government investment company,
and Lebaga Tabung Angkatan Tentera, the armed forces pension fund. Both
voted against the merger, saying the plan would have shifted investment out
of Malaysia.
'We decided that the best thing to do was to reject the move, and it's now
up to Rothmans to come up with a deal that will benefit us,' said Mr Abdul
Khalid Ibrahim, chief executive of PNB.
As part of a strategy to give the majority Malay community a greater share
of national wealth, the Malaysian government insists that at least 30 per
cent of shares in listed companies be held by Malays. The merger was also
rejected because it would have diluted Malaysian control over local
operations.
Although Rothmans admits its original plan is dead, it says it still wants
to proceed with some sort of merger. One possible option is a merger
including the Singapore company but excluding the Malaysian operation.
Everything, however, is still very much up in the air.
Opinion in Malaysia is sharply divided about recent events. While some feel
that Rothmans (Malaysia) has struck a blow for local interests against a
foreign multinational, others are not so happy.
Shareholders in Rothmans (Malaysia) have watched the value of their holdings
dive: one day earlier this week Rothmans (Malaysia) shares lost nearly
Dollars 5 on the Kuala Lumpur exchange.
While Rothmans in Singapore has the licence to sell its cigarettes in
Indo-China and elsewhere in Asia (it has recently set up a joint venture in
Burma), Rothmans (Malaysia) is limited to the home market.
Analysts say Rothmans (Malaysia) growth is uncertain in what is a mature
domestic market. Government restrictions on tobacco advertising and
campaigns against smoking could further affect profits.
'Short-term nationalist interests have won out over longer-term regional
objectives,' said one industry analyst. 'In the long term, China is the
market to be in.
'Now Rothmans (Malaysia) has more or less closed itself off from any
regional expansion. In the process it has also brought into question the
future of Rothmans operations in east Asia.'

The computer industry had been disappointed by the performance of
'Windows-NT', Microsoft's own next-generation operating software, he said.
A greater threat was Next Corporation's 'Nextstep' software, but HP had
already concluded an agreement with Next and would be able to offer
customers either Nextstep or Taligent software. Microsoft and Apple said
yesterday that they had agreed to develop software which would enable their
customers to share information and messaging services across networks which
use both Microsoft and Apple operating systems.

venture, it said.
GM will hold a 51 per cent stake in the venture. Wan Yuan will have 39 per
cent, and Beijing Economic Technology Investment Development, 10 per cent.
Wan Yuan is a subsidiary of the China Aerospace, responsible for developing,
manufacturing and testing launch vehicles for space satellites. Beijing
Economic Technology Investment Development is controlled by the Beijing
municipal government.
At a preview of the North American International Auto show, Mr J. T.
Battenberg, GM vice-president and group executive in charge of GM's

Smith Barney Shearson, the Wall Street brokerage house, and Mellon Bank, the
US banking group, have ended their row over who should administer mutual
funds from the old Shearson Lehman firm. They reached a settlement that will
allow the two companies to share the administration of the disputed funds.
The agreement concludes a four-month feud between the two companies.
Last month, Mellon had secured an injunction preventing Smith Barney
Shearson from diverting its mutual fund administration business away from
the Boston Company, the money management operation which Mellon bought from
Shearson for Dollars 1.45bn in 1992.
The injunction followed a lawsuit Mellon had filed contending that Smith
Barney Shearson had broken an agreement drawn up when Shearson merged with
Smith Barney in March 1993.
Under the terms of that pact, the Boston Company was to administer
Shearson's mutual funds, as had been agreed when the firm was sold to Mellon
the year before.
Under the settlement, however, Smith Barney Shearson agreed to pass on some
of the administrative business for its funds to the Boston Company. The two
sides said the agreement would last until May 2000.
Procter &amp; Gamble of the US has acquired an additional 13 per cent stake in
the cleaning products maker Compania Qumica, a week after buying 74 per cent
of the Argentine company, Reuter reports.
No price or further details of the transaction were given.

The New Straits Times Press, Malaysia's largest newspaper and publishing
group, announced pre-tax profits for the year ended August 31 1993 of
MDollars 92.2m (Dollars 35.5m), a marginal increase on the previous year's
MDollars 92m, writes Kieran Cooke in Kuala Lumpur.
Group turnover improved 11 per cent to MDollars 422.6m.
The company said higher taxation costs and depreciation on capital
expenditure from new printing facilities kept the increase small.

<TEXT>
Ciba-Geigy, the Swiss pharmaceutical group, plans to invest over Dollars 10m
to enter the Chinese contact lens and solutions market. Mr Chang Chih-hung,
general manager of Ciba Vision Taiwan, announced the decision in Taipei,
which is the site of the conglomerate's north-east Asia regional operating
headquarters.
The project, including supply of capital, technology and manager and
technician training, will be managed from Taipei.
Ciba Vision's initial investment plans will be divided into three phases.
During the first phase, beginning this year, Ciba will invest Dollars 4m to
set up Ciba Vision Shanghai for production and sales of contact lens and
solutions.
At first, finished lenses will be imported from the US until the Shanghai
plant's products are officially introduced into the market in 1995.
During the second stage, an additional Dollars 6m will be invested to set up
a contact lens care solutions factory in Beijing in co-operation with
Ciba-Geigy, its parent company.
In 1996, the Beijing facility will come on line. During the third stage,
Ciba Vision will set up sales outlets in the main Chinese cities.
Mr Chang said the company aimed to break even within four years and capture
over 25 per cent of the mainland Chinese market in contact lens and
solutions.
By that time, the group's annual sales should exceed TDollars 200m (Dollars
7.5m).
Ciba Vision carried out over 20 market surveys throughout China during the
past two years into consumer practices and habits.
Chang cited rising income levels, the liberalisation of the economic
structure and the gradual maturation of consumer health concepts and
education as key factors why Ciba chose this time to officially enter the
Chinese market.

<TEXT>
The Portuguese Cabinet has rejected a bid by Banco Comercial Portugues to
buy state-owned Banco Pinto e Sotto Mayor, the government said after
yesterday's weekly cabinet meeting, Reuter reports from Lisbon.
BCP was the sole bidder for an 80 per cent stake in BPSM, one of Portugal's
largest banks, when it was put up for privatisation last year.
However, the Cabinet statement said: 'The jury (which assessed the bid)
proposed rejection of the proposal on the grounds that the necessary
conditions for it to be accepted had not been met.'
Banking sources said BCP offered less than Es14bn (Dollars 81.4m) for BPSM,
well below the government's minimum asking price of Es44bn.
Officials said Banco Bilbao Vizcaya was officially discouraged from bidding
by the Portuguese government because it did not want to see another leading
Portuguese bank pass under Spanish control.
Banking sources said BPSM failed to excite wider interest because it was
heavily over-staffed and under-capitalised and needed to make Es70bn of
provisions for its pension fund over the next two years in order meet legal
requirements.
The centre-right government's rejection of BCP's bid for BPSM was widely
expected. Mr Anibal Cavaco Silva, prime minister, must decide whether to
launch a public competition for the sale of BPSM or sell it off through
direct negotiations.
The bank's net profit fell to Es1.03bn in 1992 from Es2.07bn in 1991, but
banking sources said it was expected to improve in 1993.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Superfos, one of Denmark's largest conglomerates, signed a letter of intent
yesterday to sell its grain and fodder division, which will halve group
turnover.
The decision to sell was accompanied by the resignation of Mr Bent le Fevre,
the managing director.
The buyer is Dansk Landbrugs Grovvareselskab (DLG), the agricultural
co-operative group, which will pay DKr500m (Dollars 74.6m) and redeem
DKr400m credits owed by the grain and fodder division to the Superfos parent
company.
Turnover in Superfos's grain and fodder division in 1992 was Dkr3.7bn to
DLG's DKr6.4bn, with market shares of 13 per cent and 23 per cent
respectively.
Superfos's grain and fodder division lost DKr64m in the first half of 1993,
when there was a group loss of DKr23m.
In the 1980s Superfos was forced to sell its fertilisers businesses, another
traditional sector, after the company lost heavily as a result of expanding
into that market in the US.
Superfos's main remaining businesses will be road surfacing (in which it has
a group of companies operating in the US) and the manufacture of plastic
containers.

chocolate plant

<TEXT>
Nestle, the food and mineral waters group, yesterday took a step into the
east European market when it won effective control of Goplana, Poland's
second largest chocolate factory with sales last year worth Dollars 64m.
The Nestle investment valued at Dollars 43m is Poland's largest joint
venture and marks the Swiss group's first large move into manufacturing in
the country. The agreement, comes after PepsiCo Foods International bought a
majority share in Wedel, the country's largest chocolate manufacturer in
1991.
Goplana and Wedel control over a quarter of the domestic confectionery
market. Wawel, Poland's other main producer based in Krakow, has been
privatised through an employee and management buy-out. Under the deal
clinched yesterday in Poznan where Goplana is based, Nestle will take a 47
per cent share in the joint venture at the cost of Dollars 35.9m. The state
Treasury is to contribute the Goplana plant, valued at Dollars 35.9m, for
its 47 per cent share.
The Swiss food group is to finance the purchase of the remaining 6 per cent
of the equity by the plant's employees. Nestle has snatched Goplana away
from E. D. and F. Man, the UK commodities broker who had for two years been
working in partnership with Elite Industries, an Israeli food processor to
win control of the factory.
The E. D. and F. Man offer which was strongly supported by the Goplana
employees was finally rejected by workers' delegates after a campaign last
autumn masterminded by Samuel Montagu. This used advertising on local radio
and had Nestle representatives at the factory gates explaining the merits of
their company's offer to the 2,400 workforce.
Under the terms of yesterday's agreement the Treasury will after two years
sell to Nestle as many shares as are needed to bring the Swiss group up to
51 per cent. Nestle has agreed to see the remaining equity held by the state
then floated on the Warsaw stock exchange.

FT  07 JAN 94 / International Company News: Mission begins to salvage rump
from wreck - Metallgesellschaft's financial plight could have been worse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was a little bit like waking up after a car crash and finding you could
still move your arms and legs.'
A Frankfurt-based banker, recovering yesterday from shock revelations from
Metallgesellschaft of a DM1.8bn (Dollars 1.1bn) group loss last year and a
call for a DM3.2bn transfusion into new equity and credit lines, had checked
the damage and found it could have been far worse.
Others echoed his diagnosis. 'All in all they came up with good proposals.
No-one liked them, but they mean that no bank will take a hit,' commented
another participant at Wednesday's meeting with the new management of the
debt-ridden metals, mining and engineering group.
By yesterday morning, the positive response the group claimed to have
detected the previous evening at its meeting with 40 to 50 creditor banks,
appeared to be developing into a general commitment - part-resigned,
part-enthusiastic - to join the rescue. In spite of some cloudy language,
there was no mistaking the tendency at Commerzbank, for example, which is
owed some DM200m. 'We will do all we can to help develop a rational
concept,' officials said.
However, other creditors, such as Credit Lyonnais (with loans to the group
of almost DM250m) refused any comment on their attitude. The French bank is
the third biggest creditor behind Deutsche Bank and the Bayerische
Landesbank.
Although the result of the appeal will not be known until next Wednesday,
when the banks' responses are due in, Mr Kajo Neukirchen, the new group
chairman, appeared yesterday to have a good chance of winning the financial
foundations necessary to underpin the reconstruction of Germany's 14th
largest corporation.
'If the proposals are accepted I feel the company can pay off its debts and
generate profits. I have no idea how long it will take. But those banks
which do not join in will be making a mistake,' said one participant. 'The
question we have to ask ourselves is: is the company so far gone that it is
not possible to save it? Bankers are not stupid, no matter what some might
say.'
The consensus appeared to be that the financial community's need to be
convinced of the possibility of salvaging a viable rump from the wreckage,
had been fulfilled. Lenders had been convinced at the meeting that its
crisis had been brought on by a one-off case of over-speculation in oil
which had gone badly wrong. The previous management had mis-reported the
facts to its supervisory board, but that had been corrected, one banker
said.
Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank, large shareholders and house banks to the
group, had 'stitched up a deal in their own best interests', but that was
only to be expected. The alternative to a rescue package, as Mr Neukirchen
said on television yesterday, was insolvency.
The alternative to early signs of commitment from the banking community, as
one observer said, would be a loss of confidence in core operations in plant
construction and environmental engineering which rely heavily in
international contracts, often government funded.
Although the group has said all creditors are required to help, there was
little concern in Frankfurt that withdrawals by faint-hearted peripheral
lenders would bring the whole deal down.
'Deutsche and Dresdner will do everything to make this work. I am sure they
will take up the slack if there is any,' said one German bank official.
If that proves to be the case and the financial supports are put in place,
Mr Neukirchen, credited with saving engineers Klockner-Humboldt-Deutz and
FAG Kugelfischer, can set to work on rebuilding the corporation.
He had a list of potential disposals, he said yesterday, mentioning a
Canadian mining company and vehicle components.
Bankers suggested the oil business and smelting as other candidates, but
remarked that businesses named as sell-off candidates at Wednesday's meeting
were relatively few in number and would probably have been earmarked for
sale even if the oil markets disaster had not happened.
'The main thing is that his record suggests he'll manage this affair in good
order, which is what we all need at the moment,' one said.

<TEXT>
Mr Georges Veydovsky has resigned as general director of CSA, the Czech
national airline in which Air France, the Caisse des Depots and the European
Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) have equal share in a 40 per
cent stake, the Czech news agency reported yesterday.
It said the resignation was accepted, though CSA or Air France would not
comment on the report last night.
Mr Jan Strasky, Czech transport minister, was also reported to have
confirmed the government would provide guarantees on Dollars 8.5m of
payments for aircraft leases due by mid-January.
Mr Veydovsky, who was Air France representative on the CSA management board,
is said to have offered his resignation at a shareholders' meeting in Prague
yesterday. The meeting was called to discuss restructuring plans for the
troubled Czech airline, which is expected to post losses of up to Kcs1.2bn
(Dollars 41m) for 1993.
Management board changes had been expected following the appointment of Mr
Antonin Jakubse as CSA president last month. He replaced Mr Jiri Fiker. Mr
Fiker was asked to resign by the Czech government, which still holds 49 per
cent of CSA's shares through the National Property Fund, an institution
established to oversee privatisations.
Mr Jakubse's appointment was one of several decisions taken at a
shareholders' meeting specially convened before Christmas to discuss CSA's
worsening financial position, and claims by Air France and the EBRD that the
company was overvalued when they bought their stakes in 1992.
That meeting agreed to implement a crisis restructuring plan to bring the
troubled Czech carrier back into profit within two to three years.
Mr Jakubse was charged with immediately preparing a 'crisis plan' for the
airline. Industry sources suggested this would include reducing the
workforce, and cutting back on unprofitable routes.

FT  07 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Management buys PJH for Pounds 25.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PJH Group, one of Britain's largest wholesale distributors of kitchen,
bedroom and bathroom furniture, has been bought by its management from Asko
Deutsche Kaufhaus, one of Germany's leading retail chains, for Pounds 25.5m.
Mr David Riley, a former sales director who has been on the board of Spring
Ram for the last six years, will be the new chief executive. Mr Riley was
headhunted by Spring Ram, the troubled Yorkshire kitchens and bathrooms
group, during its mid-1980s expansion.
Spring Ram is one of PJH's suppliers.
Because of the recession in Germany, Kaufhaus is divesting from non-core
businesses in much the same way as large UK companies did three years ago.
PJH was Kaufhaus's only British interest.
The company, which has annual sales of about Pounds 70m, made a Pounds 3.1m
profit in 1992, and has survived the recession partly because of a
5,000-strong customer base of small or medium-sized builders' merchants and
retailers, rather than supplying a few large outlets.
It operates from Bolton and has eight trading centres throughout Britain,
employing about 400 people.
Founded as Peter J Hopkinson in 1972, PJH was owned by Lonrho from 1978,
which sold it to GBS, a Kaufhaus subsidiary, in 1990.
'The management has already proved itself', Mr Riley said yesterday. 'The
predicted upturn in the home improvement and property markets should offer
scope to grow the business further from its strong base.'
Risk capital was arranged by Montagu Private Equity, supported by Schroder
Ventures, with loans and overdraft facilities from Midland Bank.

FT  07 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Dixons sticks to sound game plan -
Undeterred by the whims of youth the retailer is intent on growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After Dixons' surprise announcement in September that it had offloaded its
lossmaking US Silo chain onto US retailer Fretter, yesterday's news of poor
trading in its UK business was the last thing that the City wanted to hear.
'The nightmare was always going to be, if, after they dealt so well with the
Silo problem, the UK was to go wrong,' said one analyst.
The disappointment that Dixons' profits were not going to increase as
expected was reflected in the 15 per cent slide in the share price. But as
the dust settled, analysts suggested that the poor performance over
Christmas and lacklustre first-half results were caused more by external
factors and market conditions than of problems with underlying strategy.
Christmas trading suffered disproportionately from poor sales and price wars
in the computer games sector, which seriously damaged margins. That sector
had sparkled over Christmas 1992 when it helped Dixons to a 17 per cent
sales increase.
Meanwhile, gross margins came under pressure in the first half, thanks
partly to increasing price competition, but also due to higher import costs
following the devaluation of sterling.
In a brown goods market which did not grow at all in value, and a white
goods market which grew only 3 per cent, Dixons did well to increase market
share and record like-for-like sales increases in its three main chains.
Dixons has earned much respect for the way it has developed its UK retail
business and turned around the Currys chain.
An important part of its strategy has been a move away from its price-led
'pile it high, sell it cheap,' style of retailing of the 1980s, with a
strong own-brand element, to become a more upmarket, service and brand-led
business.
Customer service was a notorious weak point in the late 1980s and Dixons has
improved both pre and after-sales care through better training and the
introduction of repair centres into many stores.
Another important move was to reposition the businesses. Dixons, which will
remain a high-street chain, is designed to attract a high-level of impulse
purchases, by more technologically-aware customers, and its product range
has a high-tech bias.
The size of the chain is likely to change little from the present 357
stores.
Currys is aimed more at planned purchases by customers less confident of
technology, and is biased towards larger goods, such as televisions,
refrigerators and washing machines. Currys is gradually being shifted away
from the high street towards out-of-town superstores.
The high street chain shrank by 16 stores to 346 in the first half, while
the superstore chain added 12 stores to reach 145. It is the latter that has
been driving retailing profits growth in recent years, and Dixons plans to
accelerate expansion towards 250 stores.
Since last February, a final part of the strategy has been PC World, the
computer superstore chain acquired for Pounds 8.5m from Vision Technology
Group. Dixons would have entered the market anyway, but the acquisition
provided it with a tried-and-tested format and a headstart on competitors.
Three PC Worlds opened last year in Cardiff, Bristol and Leeds, taking the
chain to seven, and six more are planned.
Analysts believe the chain could generate Pounds 1m annual profits per
store, and there could be 20 stores in place by 1995-96.
Meanwhile, Dixons needs to find the next big thing to take over from the
flagging games consoles market. Mr John Clare, chief executive, says there
are a number of candidates, including mobile telephones, lap-top computers
and personal organisers - even if they lack the youth appeal of the Super
Nintendo and the Sega Megadrive.

FT  07 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Pelican expands to Pounds 0.96m and expects
further growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pelican Group, the restaurant operator, reported pre-tax profits ahead from
Pounds 357,000 to Pounds 960,000 in the six months to September 30.
Turnover rose to Pounds 6.67m (Pounds 3.83m). The company opened four
restaurants during the period taking the total to 28.
However, the results included only five month contributions from both the
Yankee Noodle Restaurants, acquired in May for Pounds 6m and from Cafe
Pelican, the refurbished central London outlet, which contributed more than
a tenth of operating profits.
'We are now in a position to continue our strategy of creating multiple
restaurant chains. We now have many concepts available for expansion
throughout the UK and a strong management structure in place in the US,'
said Mr Roger Myers, chairman.
He said the company's rapid expansion in recent years had yielded bulk
buying benefits. 'The real growth comes from opening more restaurants and
from the Yankee Noodle acquisition.'
Mr Robert Earl, who is behind the Planet Hollywood chain of themed burger
restaurants, has become an executive director of Pelican's US subsidiary. He
joined Pelican as a non-executive in May with the Yankee Noodle acquisition.
Operating profit rose to Pounds 1.03m (Pounds 538,000) and interest charges
fell to Pounds 66,000 (Pounds 181,000). Total debt at the half-way stage
stood at Pounds 1.5m (Pounds 3m) giving gearing of 10 per cent. Mr Myers
said gearing should not exceed current levels.
The company has no need to raise funds for organic growth from shareholders
following last year's Pounds 6m placing and open offer which paid for the
Yankee Noodle acquisition.
Mr Myers said all the restaurants were now generating cash and were
profitable. Cash flow from operating activities in the period was more than
Pounds 1m (Pounds 450,000).
Earnings per share rose to 1.95p (1.89p) after a tax charge this time of
Pounds 200,000.
For the second successive year, the board has decided not to pay an interim
dividend so as to 'maximise the funds available to fuel expansion', Mr Myers
said.

FT  07 JAN 94 / UK Company News: St Ives sells Talbot back to founder
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
St Ives, the UK printing group, has sold Talbot Publishing Systems, its
small lossmaking newspaper systems and software development business which
was acquired in July 1990, back to Mr Andrew Clunies-Ross, its managing
director and founder.
Talbot's main product is an Apple computer-based electronic page make-up
system designed for newspapers, but which St Ives originally hoped would
also be bought by magazine publishers.
Mr Miles Emley, St Ives' chairman, said the decision to dispose of the
business, which he said had been sold for 'a fairly nominal sum,' mainly
reflected the difficult market conditions in the pre-press industry.
This had resulted in Talbot incurring operating losses of about Pounds
100,000 in the first five months of the current year.
In addition, he said that magazine publishers had generally acquired
off-the-shelf elect-ronic publishing software packages, rather than
customised systems developed by Talbot.
Mr Emley, who succeeded Mr Robert Gavron as St Ives chairman last year, said
the Talbot business reported a profit in its first full year of ownership,
but had since lost money. As a result, no performance-related payments, over
and above the Pounds 1.2m acquisition price, have been made.
The sale means that under the latest accounting rules, goodwill of Pounds 1m
which was written off at the time of acquisition will be reinstated and
written off as exceptional.

<TEXT>
Abbey, the Dublin-based residential estate development and plant hire group,
reported profits of IPounds 2.65m (Pounds 2.54m) before tax in the six
months to October 31.
Mr Charles Gallagher, chairman, described the result, up from IPounds
501,000 last time, as 'the most encouraging for some time'. Interest income
was lower at IPounds 614,000 (IPounds 772,000).
The group's UK housebuilding operation enjoyed higher margins and completed
211 unit sales at an average price of Pounds 58,000, while the plant hire
business returned to the black reflecting rising activity and stable hire
rates.
Turnover was IPounds 18.8m (IPounds 17.8m). An interim dividend of 2p is
payable from earnings of 4.58p (0.43p) per share.

<TEXT>
Cassidy Brothers, the USM-traded toymaker, suffered a 24 per cent downturn
in pre-tax profits from Pounds 716,055 to Pounds 541,368 for the six months
to October 31.
Turnover declined from Pounds 4.35m to Pounds 4.02m. However, in early
October a 'flood' of orders helped 'ease the pain' of the slow business
endured up until September.
Sales for November and December showed an increase of 43 per cent at Pounds
1.65m (Pounds 1.15m) and with 'guarded optimism' the company said turnover
for the full year would be in the region of Pounds 6.75m (Pounds 6.26m).
It added that if that forecast was met, pre-tax profits for the 12 months
'could well approach Pounds 600,000' - profits for 1992-93 fell to Pounds
457,217.
The interim dividend is maintained at 0.75p from earnings of 6.95p (9.02p)
per share.
The company is considering the possibility of manufacturing a small range of
its high labour content merchandise in China.

FT  07 JAN 94 / UK Company News: MAM adds to investment operations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mercury Asset Management, the UK's largest fund management group, has agreed
in principle to buy the fund management business of River and Mercantile
Trust, one of the oldest UK investment trust companies.
The move is part of MAM's effort to diversify its businesses, which are
overwhelmingly dependent on the UK pension fund market, and expand into
services for private investors. Terms were not disclosed.
MAM, like other leading fund managers, is concerned that regulatory changes
and rising expenses will prompt employers to abandon the final salary
pension schemes which have formed the core of their businesses.
Of MAM's Pounds 56bn under management as of September 30 1993, Pounds 40bn
represented assets of UK pension funds, while Pounds 10bn came from
international clients and a further Pounds 6bn belonged to private
investors.
'We have wanted to diversify our business into the international side and
the private investor side,' said Mr David Rosier, managing director of MAM's
private investor businesses. 'A gap in our armour was that we had no
investment trusts, bar one.' Last year, MAM raised Pounds 426m with its
Mercury World Mining Trust.
River and Mercantile Investment Management, which is to be acquired by MAM,
was formed in 1985 as the fund management arm of River and Mercantile Trust,
an investment trust formed in 1881. It specialises in managing split-capital
investment trusts which concentrate on the selection of stocks with high
dividend streams. Its 15 staff will be employed by MAM.
The fund management company looks after about Pounds 400m, of which Pounds
215m is in its original investment trust. It has four other investment
trusts and runs personal equity plans for roughly 3,500 individual clients.

FT  07 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Expansion at B'ham Midshires
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Birmingham Midshires, the UK's 13th largest building society, has bought
over Pounds 45m of residential mortgages from the Dunedin Mortgage Company
for an undisclosed amount.
The mortgage book comprises 950 borrowers, with an average loan value of
Pounds 47 000.
It represents Birmingham Midshires' fourth purchase of a portfolio within
the last year, and takes the value of the assets acquired in that period to
Pounds 295m. Its assets now amount to more than Pounds 4bn.
The society views acquisition as a faster route to increasing asset size
than organic growth.
The sale of the DMC mortgage book follows the announcement last autumn that
the Internationale Nederlanden Groep, one of Europe's biggest life assurance
companies, was selling the Life Association of Scotland to Britannia Life.
Britannia did not want the Dunedin property group, the joint venture set up
in the 1980s in which LAS was one of the partners, saying it had enough
property development of its own, while Dunedin's Dutch parent no longer
wanted to continue in the UK mortgage market through the separate activities
of DMC.

FT  07 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Exceptional leaves Osprey Pounds 5m in red
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Osprey Communications, which provides advertising and associated services,
incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 5.07m for the 16 months ended September
after taking account of an exceptional provision of Pounds 4.33m.
During the period the group sold its marketing services division to
management for Pounds 2.1m, bought SMS Communications in cash and shares and
raised Pounds 1.5m via a rights issue.
Mr Jack Rubins, who took over as chairman following SMS's reversal into
Osprey, said the results were dominated by the impact of the first 12 months
during which trading was 'far from satisfactory.'
He said yesterday that since June Osprey had returned an operating profit
each month, borrowings had been substantially reduced and the group had
closed its extended financial period on a 'positive note'.
Turnover for the 16 months totalled Pounds 29.4m and operating losses
amounted to Pounds 282,000. Losses per share emerged at 30.12p. There is no
final dividend, leaving shareholders with just 0.1p for the period.
For the 12 months to May 31 1992 the group incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds
336,000 on turnover of Pounds 25.6m. Losses per share emerged at 2.03p and a
dividend of 0.65p was paid.
The shares closed 2 1/2 p higher at 35p.

FT  07 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Clerical Medical bonuses trimmed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Clerical Medical, the mutual insurance group, has cut its bonuses on
with-profits endowment policies, leading to lower pay-outs for both 10-year
and 25-year policies maturing this year.
The maturity value of a 10-year policy, taken out by a man aged 29 paying
Pounds 30 a month, is Pounds 6,537, down 6 per cent from last year, while a
25-year policy is worth Pounds 60,820, down 1 per cent. Bonus rates on
unitised with-profit policies and individual pension products have also been
cut.
Mr Paul Gregory, marketing manager of Clerical Medical's life business unit,
said the cuts were 'less acute than they might have been', and attributed
this to good investment returns at the end of 1993. However, he added:
'Bonus rates may be expected to continue to fall.'
AXA Equity &amp; Law, which declares its bonuses in two stages, yesterday said
that reversionary bonuses (which are attached to a policy throughout its
life and cannot be revoked) on with-profit policies would be maintained,
while bonuses on unitised with-profit policies would be cut. The company is
due to announce terminal bonus rates - which determine final maturity values
 -for this year in February.

Starmin, the quarry products company chaired by Lord Parkinson, has sold
Brand &amp; Rae, the Fife-based manufacturer of dense and lightweight building
blocks and concrete roofing tiles, for Pounds 413,000 cash.
Starmin is responsible for collection of debts and payment of creditors

borrowings by disposing of non-core assets.

Greenwich Resources, the metals and minerals exploration group, achieved a
turnround from pre-tax losses of Pounds 697,000 to profits of Pounds 106,000
in the year to September 30.
Mr Colin Phipps, chairman, said the result reflected the continuing benefits
from restructuring carried out in 1991-92.
He added that administrative expenses were further reduced during the year
and, of the Pounds 3.7m spent on exploring the mineral properties, the
group's share was largely funded by joint venture partners.
After tax of Pounds 4,000 (Pounds 33,000) earnings per share came through at
0.1p (1p losses).

<TEXT>
The Fleming International High Income Investment Trust has maintained its
interim dividend at 1p for the six months to November 30. It is expected
that the total for the year will be unchanged at 3.5675p.
Net revenue fell from Pounds 2.36m to Pounds 2.12m for earnings per share of
1.9p (2.11p). The reduction was caused by a fall to Pounds 30,000 (Pounds
647,000) in deposit income as the trust moved to being fully invested.
Net asset value per share at the period end was 48.5p, against 39.8p a year
earlier. Net assets per zero dividend share were 83.2p (73.6p).

FT  07 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Upturn in new car sales lifts Reg Vardy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The sharp recovery in new car sales was highlighted yesterday by Reg Vardy,
the Sunderland-based multi-franchise motor distribution group, which
reported a substantial increase in first-half turnover and profits.
Pre-tax profits, bolstered by a Pounds 800,000 gain on the sale of surplus
land, jumped by 97 per cent to Pounds 3.51m in the six months to October 31,
up from a restated Pounds 1.78m.
The figures have been adjusted to take account of FRS 3.
Earnings per share increased to 5.3p (2.9p) and the interim dividend is
raised to 1.4p (1.3p).
The shares rose 5p to 185p.
Turnover increased by 32 per cent to Pounds 142.7m (Pounds 108m) with
roughly 70 per cent coming from the group's 20 volume car franchises and the
remainder generated by the 6 specialist franchises.
New car sales increased from 4,000 last time to just over 6,000, including a
record 2,911 vehicles sold in August.
On a like-for-like basis, car sales expanded by about 13 per cent,
outstripping the underlying market growth.
However, the surge in sales also reflected the addition of five new
dealerships, including the acquisition of Mercedes-Benz dealerships in
Cambridge and Glasgow in May and June last year, and a Fiat/Alfa Romeo
dealership in Aberdeen, also in June.
The group spent Pounds 7.4m on acquisitions and new business developments
during the first-half and the acquired dealerships contributed Pounds
300,000 of operating profits after incurring Pounds 250,000 of initial
set-up costs.
Overall operating profits increased by 44 per cent to Pounds 3.21m (Pounds
2.22m), including Pounds 296,000 (Pounds 60,000) from acquisitions.
Mr Peter Vardy, chairman, said margins from used cars improved considerably
and contributions from service, parts and bodyshops all continued to show
encouraging growth.

FT  07 JAN 94 / Market set to give verdict on Metallgesellschaft rescue plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Investors' reactions to the proposed salvage plan for Metallgesellschaft
will be tested this morning when trading resumes in the debt-laden group's
shares.
The stock was suspended in Frankfurt yesterday following press reports of
losses last year of almost DM2bn (Pounds 700m) compared with the DM347m
deficit announced in November.
The metals, mining and engineering conglomerate confirmed late yesterday
that it expected to report a loss of DM1.8bn for the year to the end of
September 1993, and warned of a possible further DM1.5bn in obligations as
it unwound positions in the US oil futures markets.
In an early indication of the mood, bank stocks lost ground yesterday after
formal publication of details of the rescue scheme presented to the
company's creditors on Wednesday evening. Representatives of some 40 to 50
banks were asked to subscribe to a DM3.2bn package comprising a capital
injection, debt-for-equity deals and new credit.
According to banking sources, the group's top five creditors are Deutsche
Bank, Bayerische Landesbank, Credit Lyonnais, NordLB, and Societe Generale.
Credit Lyonnais yesterday confirmed it was owed DM246m, while Commerzbank
said its loans amounted to around DM200m.
Stock market traders were reportedly irritated that Mr Kajo Neukirchen, the
newly appointed group chairman, revealed further details of his plans in
television interviews. Mr Neukirchen warned that the alternative was
insolvency if the banks did not rally around.
Subsidiaries earmarked for disposal included a Canadian mining operation and
the Kolbenschmidt automotive components company. Bankers said the US oil
business and metals smelting operations were also likely to go.

FT  07 JAN 94 / Unilever tries to cut advertising costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch food group and the highest spending advertiser in
the UK, is switching a substantial proportion of its London TV advertising
for 1994, worth in total about Pounds 30m, from Carlton to London Weekend
Television in a bid to drive down rates.
Granada Television is also under threat of losing its Unilever advertising,
worth about Pounds 11m in 1993, unless it can meet the group's terms.
Initiative Media, Unilever's media buying company, would not comment
yesterday on the moves, but LWT confirmed it had gained at least some
Unilever advertising that had formerly been placed with Carlton, the weekday
broadcaster.
In December, in another switch, two media buyers, CIA Media and Lowe Howard
Spink, moved advertising believed to be worth about Pounds 28m from LWT to
Carlton. The clients in that transaction included Tesco, Commercial Union
and Lloyds bank.
Mr Neil Blackley, an analyst with Goldman Sachs International, said
yesterday: 'It's swings and roundabouts. You're dealing with a fixed volume
media. You lose a certain volume and the price adjusts downwards and you
fill it up from somewhere else.'
Both Carlton and Granada, the north-west TV company, said yesterday they
were still negotiating for the Unilever advertising. Mr Martin Bowley,
Carlton sales director, said he was 'amazed' to read trade press reports
yesterday claiming that Initiative Media had pulled all its Unilever
advertising from Carlton and allocated it to LWT. Talks were taking place
yesterday between the parties, he said. 'As it stands we are currently in
full negotiation for 1994.'
Granada said it was in the middle of what were the 'usual healthy
negotiations' with a big client. Initiative Media, which is heavily
dependent on Unilever business, has a reputation as a tough negotiator.
However, industry observers consider it unlikely that it will want to pull
all Unilever advertising from Granada. It is also unlikely that Unilever
will want to want to concentrate all its advertising for products such as
Comfort, Persil, Radion and Birds Eye, at the weekend, or to miss out on
popular Carlton programmes.

FT  07 JAN 94 / 10% of Elf for core investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A group of long-term stable investors will hold 10 per cent of the shares in
Elf-Aquitaine, the French oil group, following its privatisation, Mr Edmond
Alphandery, the economy minister, has announced.
The privatisation, which will be launched this month, is the largest so far
in the government's plan to sell 21 public sector groups. The sale of the
majority of the government's 50.8 per cent stake in Elf, France's largest
industrial company, is expected to raise up to FFr40bn (Pounds 4.6bn).
Speaking at a business conference, Mr Alphandery said 1.5 per cent of Elf's
shares would be taken by Union des Assurances de Paris, France's largest
insurance group which is already an investor in the oil company.
A tender for the other 8.5 per cent of Elf's shares allotted to core
investors will be launched this weekend. UAP is expected to be joined in
Elf's 'noyau dur' of stable investors by a number of France's leading
financial and industrial groups. These include Banque Nationale de Paris,
first to be privatised last year, AXA, the insurance group, Paribas, the
investment bank, and Suez, the financial and industrial holding company.
Renault, the state-owned carmaker, also slated for privatisation, is another
likely investor. Its industrial alliances with Elf include collaboration in
Formula 1 car racing.
The government will retain between 10 and 15 per cent of Elf's shares
through Erap, the state holding company. Through a golden share it will have
a veto over the sale of some assets, and investors seeking to raise stakes
above thresholds of 10, 20 and 33.3 per cent will need official approval.
Mr Alphandery said privatisation would continue at a steady pace. Next on
the list of candidates is UAP.

FT  07 JAN 94 / Dixons shares fall on warning
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Dixons, the UK's largest electrical retailer, plunged from 283p to
240p yesterday, after it rushed out a profits warning following
disappointing Christmas sales.
Dixons also announced pre-tax losses of Pounds 196.7m for the 28 weeks to
November 13, after exceptional charges of Pounds 214m virtually all on the
sale of its loss-making US chain Silo to Fretter, the US electrical
retailer.
It brought the announcement forward by six days after receiving figures
showing Christmas sales volumes little changed from last year. 'We felt we
could not allow relatively false trading in the shares for another week,'
said Mr John Clare, chief executive.
The poor Christmas result was due mainly to a price war in the computer
games sector - which had performed spectacularly well in an otherwise
lacklustre market the previous Christmas.
Mr Clare said the consequent fall in profit margins meant retail operating
profits were 'unlikely to equal last year's level'. Analysts downgraded
profits forecasts for the full year from about Pounds 90m to Pounds 75m.
Dixons' first-half performance was more in line with expectations. Stripping
out exceptional items, pre-tax profits improved from Pounds 14m to Pounds
17.3m and turnover from continuing operations increased from Pounds 571m to
Pounds 752.4m.
UK retail sales increased 13 per cent to Pounds 642.9m, although operating
profits were up only 3 per cent to Pounds 19.4m, reflecting pressure on
margins from price competition and rising import costs. Sales from existing
stores increased 10 per cent in the Currys superstore chain, 2 per cent in
Currys high street stores and 1 per cent in Dixons.
The European property business converted a Pounds 400,000 loss into a Pounds
5.1m profit as sales leapt from Pounds 2.7m to Pounds 109.5m with the
disposal of the Beaulieu office development in Brussels.
Dixons lifted the interim dividend from 1.6p to 1.7p, in spite of incurring
a loss per share after exceptionals of 49.2p, compared with 0.9p earnings.
Before exceptionals, earnings were 1.8p.
As well as upgrading Mr Clare's position from managing director to chief
executive, Dixons announced that Mr Mark Souhami, deputy chairman, would
switch from a full-time to a part-time role.

FT  07 JAN 94 / Judgment and handling other people's money / A look at JP
Morgan's involvement with Banesto
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER and PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Six days before the Bank of Spain imposed a new management on Banco Espanol
de Credito (Banesto), it was told of an alternative. An audacious plan had
been devised by executives of JP Morgan, the US bank, led by Mr Roberto
Mendoza, a Morgan vice-chairman. It was a last attempt to save Spain's
fourth-biggest bank and its chairman Mr Mario Conde, from a gathering
crisis.
The plan involved writing down Pta265bn (Pounds 1.25bn) of Banesto's
deteriorating assets in a 'big bang' that would wipe out more than half its
capital of Pta412bn, and leave it Dollars 725m short of the central bank's
minimum level of capital that banks must hold against assets. Banesto would
compensate by issuing more capital and selling half its holding in a
Portuguese bank.
Mr Luis Angel Rojo, the Bank of Spain's governor, was not convinced. On
December 28, after Banesto's shares had been suspended by the stock exchange
commission amid rumours of intervention, he acted. By sacking the board on
which both Mr Conde and Mr Mendoza sat, he detonated a controversy which has
now raged for a week around both Banesto and Morgan.
Morgan's involvement with Banesto since 1987 has turned into one of the
stiffest tests of its attempt to broaden from its roots as a pure commercial
bank by providing a range of services, backed by its own capital, to its
corporate clients. The US bank appears to have demonstrated loyalty to one
of its clients in the toughest times, but has it shown good judgment?
An even tougher question is whether it acted wisely in backing one of its
clients with the capital of others. Morgan both advised Banesto and made it
the first investment for its Dollars 1.1bn Corsair fund, 90 per cent of
which is held by other US investors. When Banesto issued Dollars 775m of
shares on Morgan's advice last summer, the US bank bought Dollars 175m of
them through Corsair.
The Bank of Spain's action raises the possibility that Morgan made two
misjudgments in its original assessment of Banesto. First, it may have
underestimated the seriousness of the Spanish bank's condition. Second, it
may have misjudged the political risk it was running in allying itself with
a bank that had a history of poor relations with the central bank.
The fact that Banesto was in a poor financial condition at the time of the
intervention last Tuesday is not in itself evidence of a Morgan misjudgment.
It was precisely because Banesto was a weak bank and its shares were trading
well below the level of other Spanish banks that it represented a chance for
Corsair to make strong capital gains as it recovered.
Morgan's original plan for Banesto was straightforward. It intended to raise
fresh capital of Dollars 1.1bn to restore Banesto's capital ratios to the
high level common among Spanish banks. This would allow it to absorb
problems with loans that grew over-rapidly between 1988 and 1991. It would
gradually sell its holdings in industrial companies, boosting capital
further.
But by last autumn, it was becoming clear that Banesto's problems were
bigger than Morgan had acknowledged. As Bank of Spain inspectors and
Morgan's executives dug into Banesto's loans and equity holdings, they
discovered an over-valuation of assets - put by the central bank at Pta503bn
and by Morgan at Pta372bn. The scale of the problem forced Morgan to
rethink.
Morgan's solution reversed a key plank of the original plan. Rather than
Banesto trying to absorb losses gradually while sustaining its capital,
Morgan decided that it should mimic the US banks which deliberately and
aggressively wrote down their less-developed country debt exposures in the
late-1980s to restore investor confidence in their earnings potential.
The fact that Morgan switched its plan for Banesto indicates some degree of
miscalculation in its first assessment of the bank. Yet Morgan could argue
that the miscalculation was not so large that Banesto was inevitably doomed.
After all, it had predicted some fall in asset quality throughout 1993 and
into the first half of 1994 in last summer's offer document.
Given another management and another central bank, the plan might have been
accepted. Even after the write-down, Banesto would have complied with
international capital adequacy standards, which are less demanding than the
Bank of Spain's. But in practice, this was irrelevant. Banesto was not only
supervised in Spain, but had a history of disputes with the central bank.
Should Morgan have rated the risk of a clash with the Bank of Spain to be
unacceptably high? There was clearly some risk, given Mr Conde's habit of
defying Mr Mariano Rubio, the former governor. Although the central bank has
indicated that Banesto may yet be restructured in quite a similar manner to
Morgan's plan, it did not trust Mr Conde to implement it.
All is not lost for Morgan, even if it did misjudge the risks. It intends to
maintain the Corsair stake in Banesto for five years, by which time
Banesto's shares could have achieved the capital gains the US bank
originally foresaw. This is a distant hope, given the likelihood that
Corsair's holding will be diluted in a restructuring, but it is not
impossible.
If Banesto's new management achieves this, Morgan as a shareholder may come
to be grateful for the Bank of Spain's actions. At the least, the central
bank has already neatly eliminated any potential conflict of interest
between Morgan's corporate finance client, Banesto's former management, and
its other set of clients, the US investors whose money it placed in Banesto.
The question of whether Morgan can comfortably combine such roles in the
future may be the enduring legacy of Banesto for the US bank. As long as it
only commits its own capital to clients, the potential for tension is
limited. But events in Madrid in the past week show the controversy it can
provoke by backing one client with the capital of others.

FT  07 JAN 94 / Fuel companies offer scheme to avoid VAT on domestic bills
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Electricity and gas companies are making arrangements for householders to
pay hundreds of millions of pounds in advance to avoid the value added tax
the government is imposing on household fuel bills from April.
At least three regional companies - Manweb, Norweb and Midlands - believe
that up to 10 per cent of householders will want to pay at least a year
ahead to reduce their bills.
If their highest expectations of 10 per cent were achieved, advance payments
for future gas and electricity bills would exceed Pounds 1.25bn. Britain's
households pay about Pounds 7bn a year for electricity and Pounds 5.65bn for
gas.
As well as achieving savings for themselves, gas and electricity buyers who
pay in advance would boost the profits of suppliers who would be able to
earn interest on the money. Many of the companies are already cash positive.
However, the government would be deprived of considerable funds. If the
pre-payment total reached Pounds 1.25bn, the tax avoidance in the year from
April, when VAT on household power and fuel will be 8 per cent, would be
Pounds 100m.
For 1995-6, the avoidance would be even greater as VAT on fuel rises to 17.5
per cent in that year. Fewer customers are likely to want to commit
themselves so far ahead even though returns would be greater.
Since the government announced the imposition of VAT in last March's budget,
financial advisers have alerted clients to a legal loophole which would
enable tax avoidance through early payment.
As the law stands, payments in advance for goods to be supplied incur the
VAT charge applicable at the time of payment rather than at the time of
supply.
Electricity and gas companies say they are not actively exhorting customers
to pay in advance but most are offering advice.
'We are not encouraging householders to pay in advance but we have to tell
them that facilities are available if they want to do it,' said
Hydro-Electric, serving north Scotland.
Several companies are sending out special leaflets with quarterly bills
explaining how VAT will affect them. Some, including East Midlands
Electricity, have provided a payment form for customers who wish to pay in
advance.
Few customers have so far taken advantage, although Yorkshire Electricity
says one customer has paid for 10 years.
Manweb, distributor in north Wales, Cheshire and Liverpool, said only 13
customers had made payments.
Northern Electric, serving the north-east of England, said it had received
just Pounds 10,000 from 17 customers and Swalec in south Wales said it had
received Pounds 15,000. However, most money is likely to be paid in the
weeks immediately before April.
Manweb said it expected up to 10 per cent of its 1.3m household customers to
pay in advance while Norweb forecast early payments of anything between
Pounds 10m and Pounds 50m, compared with an annual bill of Pounds 500m to
Pounds 600m.
British Gas and Swalec are among companies which said it was not possible to
predict likely pre-payment levels but both said they had flexible
arrangements which would enable them to cope.
Northern Electric said it doubted whether it would receive more than Pounds
1m in pre-payments.

FT  07 JAN 94 / US pledges to back fight for democracy in eastern Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM and ROBERT MAUTHNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Clinton administration yesterday pledged to support the fight for
democracy in former Soviet bloc states.
Vice-president Al Gore said the security of the US was linked with that of
eastern Europe, and that was why President Clinton was proposing a new
'Partnership for Peace', aimed at bringing former Soviet bloc states into
closer association with the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation.
Speaking as final preparations were being made for Mr Clinton's visit to
Brussels, to meet Nato leaders, and then Prague and Moscow, Mr Gore said the
partnership represented an 'evolutionary process of Nato enlargement'.
His speech was delivered in Milwaukee in the place of Mr Clinton, who flew
to Arkansas following the death early yesterday of his mother, Mrs Virginia
Kelley.
Earlier Russia warned Nato leaders not to offer east European states and
Lithuania membership of the alliance, as this could boost extreme
nationalist tendencies in Russia and undermine its reform programme.
At their summit in Brussels next week, Nato leaders intend to remain vague
about offers of membership and to refrain from giving specific security
guarantees. Instead, they are expected to propose bilateral agreements
between the alliance and any former Soviet bloc state which desires them,
which would allow close military co-operation, including joint exercises and
training for peacekeeping missions.
Yesterday, Mr Gore said Mr Clinton's objectives on his 10-day trip to Europe
would be to revive Nato, support democracy, reduce the dangers of nuclear
and chemical weapons and help the transition to market economics in the
former communist countries.
He also warned that the 'fiery nationalism' now burning in the former
Yugoslavia was smouldering in other European countries. But his speech did
not address directly the still unresolved problem of the ethnic conflict in
Bosnia.
The Clinton administration suffered further embarrassment over its policy on
Bosnia yesterday with the resignation from the foreign service of Mr Warren
Zimmermann, formerly the US ambassador to Yugoslavia.

FT  07 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Lloyd's
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
With underwriting capacity of around Pounds 10.5bn this year, Lloyd's of
London appears - against all odds - to have attracted an adequate supply of
capital. Despite heavy losses, individual Names have not deserted the
insurance market in anything like the numbers feared. Corporate investors
have contributed Pounds 1.6bn in capacity, equivalent to an influx of around
3,000 new Names. Far from facing starvation, Lloyd's management must now
consider ways of restricting the inflow of funds. If insurance rates start
to soften, such measures might be necessary as early as 1996.
Yet rationing the aggregate capacity of Lloyd's would only be a partial
solution. New investors would still be attracted to the most profitable
lines of business, encouraging syndicates to expand in these areas, often at
the wrong point in the insurance cycle. Raising a levy from all new
investors, to be varied according to the line of business underwritten,
might be the simplest way to proceed. Lloyd's management would then exercise
an unprecedented degree of control over the affairs of individual
syndicates. In the absence of a mechanism by which capital can be allocated
to syndicates on the basis of price, though, central direction is probably
better than none.
Still, the greater goal of a secondary market in syndicate participations -
and an accompanying price mechanism - should not be abandoned, despite the
legal obstacles. If standards of disclosure can be raised across the market,
the allocation of capital within Lloyd's would then be more efficient and
transparent.

FT  07 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: French property
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
As UK investors find it increasingly hard to sink money into their
rebounding domestic property market, they must be tempted to buy concrete
assets across the Channel. After all, the Paris office market followed
London into a nasty slump in capital and rental values. It would now be
natural to expect a similar bounce as French rents near their bottom,
interest rates subside, and the economy starts to firm.
However, the property recovery in France may prove a lot slower than in the
UK. That is partly because the Paris market never fell as far. French
financial institutions have helped shore up property values throughout the
recession - as demonstrated this week by the rescue of the property bank, Le
Comptoir des Entrepreneurs. Yields on prime commercial property have
therefore never climbed to heady heights. The 6 per cent yield currently
available on prime Paris properties offers less scope for capital gain than
once available in the UK.
Rental growth is also likely to be muted. Empty space in the Paris office
market amounts to more than 10 per cent of the total stock. High
unemployment rates make it unlikely that the surplus space will be quickly
absorbed. The shorter length of French leases also makes it easier for
occupiers to shop around for cheaper rents while lessening the security of
income for owners. Now is the time to buy French property. But real bargains
will be hard to find.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Now that the extent of Metallgesellschaft's problems are emerging, it is
clear that bank lenders have little choice but to go along with this week's
rescue package. Without it, liquidation would be inevitable, as Mr Kajo
Neukirchen, its new chief executive, pointed out yesterday. The revised loss
of DM1.87bn for 1992-93 significantly exceeds total shareholders' funds,
excluding minorities, reported for the previous year. Worryingly, only half
the losses came from oil trading, which the company says could cost another
DM1.5bn.
Against this background, it is even more astonishing that, only a month ago,
Mr Hilmar Kopper, chief executive of Deutsche Bank, was urging the public to
be relaxed about the company. The previous management may have withheld
information but the supervisory board, on which executives from both
Deutsche and Dresdner Bank play a prominent role, also failed spectacularly
to oversee the company's affairs.
Smaller outside shareholders will pay a large price. Not only will their
interests be seriously diluted by the capital injection from the banks; the
company is also now clearly being run in the interests of these same
creditors. Metallgesellschaft portrays its restructuring as a fresh start,
not least to engender the confidence needed to keep its sounder businesses
going. Whether that gives its shares recovery value is another matter.
Little has been said about the extent of disposals to pay down debt and
finance redundancies. How much will ultimately be left to earn dividends for
shareholders is an open question.

FT  07 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Dixons' game theory
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Perhaps Dixons is unlucky: accident prone might be a more accurate
description. No sooner has the group staunched its deep and self-inflicted
wound in the US than it falls down a manhole of margin pressure in the UK.
The savage price cutting of games over Christmas underlines the tough
conditions in electronics retailing. Margins are being squeezed by
competition in cheap own-label products and the proliferation of
interest-free offers.
That leaves retailers looking for sales growth, but there is little sign of
a new electronic fad to catch the popular imagination. A robust revival of
the replacement audio, television and white goods markets will require a
stronger upturn in the economy. Meanwhile, the opening of Costco warehouse
clubs and the move to larger out-of-town stores points towards further
competitive pressure.
To be fair, not all the problems are Dixons' fault. It is hard to blame the
company for failing to sell teenagers a second video game console in 1993 to
go with the one they got for Christmas the previous year. More reasonably,
the 1992 result can be viewed as a windfall gain. Next year, when the
effects of the Silo disaster drop out of the figures, Dixons will be left on
little more than a market rating. The tight-knit band of shareholders who
have hung on doggedly through thick and thin are presumably hardened to the
blows of fate which rain on the company, but since Dixons comprises such a
small proportion of the UK stores sector, others may wonder why they should
bother with the risks.

FT  07 JAN 94 / Leading Article: Curbing the cost of drugs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Countries struggling to cut their healthcare costs find the budget for
prescribed drugs an irresistible target. Spending on pharmaceuticals in the
advanced economies is typically about 10 per cent of health expenditure. But
as the Italian government has just discovered, cutting the cost of drugs can
unite doctors, pharmacists and pharmaceutical companies in a powerful lobby
against change.
Yet the differences between the amounts spent on drugs in European countries
indicate scope for cuts. Some countries are spending twice as much on
medicines per head as others, without achieving greater improvements in life
expectancies. Doctors in France prescribe five times as many items as UK
doctors and six times as many as in Denmark. Many of the drugs prescribed in
high-volume markets such as France are of little proven efficacy and are not
used outside those countries.
Cost-cutting reforms to the German healthcare system introduced last year
focused heavily on tighter controls over drug prescribing. As a result, more
than 20 per cent was saved on medicines between January and June 1993, with
a significant switch to cheaper, off-patent, generic medicines. Opposition
from the health professionals and the drugs industry was no less vociferous
than in Italy. But after a loss of DM9bn in 1992, the health insurance
system reported a surplus of DM2.6bn in the first six months of 1993.
Medicine sales
Italy is among the more profligate of European countries in its spending on
drugs. Pharmaceutical expenditure reached 15 per cent of the total health
budget in 1991, compared with an EU average of about 10 per cent. In the
first half of 1993, prescription medicine sales through pharmacists were
Dollars 78 a head, compared with only Dollars 46 in the UK and Dollars 54 in
the Netherlands. A recent Italian survey estimated that 10 of the top 50
products sold in that country offered no therapeutic benefit.
In an attempt to cut costs, the Italian government has increased the number
of drugs for which patients must pay some or all of the costs. It is also
trying to crack down on unauthorised drug dispensing and fraud, which have
swollen the bill. This should encourage greater responsibility in consuming
pharmaceuticals and may even promote healthier lifestyles.
Generic products
Yet more needs to be done to curb drugs spending. The UK's drugs bill is
kept down through measures such as giving doctors budget guidelines for
prescriptions, pressure to prescribe lower doses of some medicines and
widespread use of generic products. According to a report from National
Economic Research Associates - sponsored by 40 of the world's largest
pharmaceuticals companies - generic medicines are 'virtually absent' from
the Italian prescription market. Family doctors have no incentive to
prescribe them, while manufacturers, wholesalers and pharmacists enjoy
superior profit margins on branded medicines.
Simply bearing down on pharmaceutical costs may also have unintended
consequences elsewhere in the health system. Prescribing some drugs, for
example, may allow patients to be discharged earlier from hospital - or
avoid in-patient treatment altogether. Falling drugs bills could mean rising
costs of hospital and out-patient treatment.
It is overprescribing which needs to be eliminated, not prescribing as such.
Healthcare reform needs to look at the whole system to ensure that all the
players have the right incentives to provide no more treatment than is
needed.

FT  07 JAN 94 / Leading Article: More shock, more therapy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The electoral success of Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky was not an infallible
prophecy. It was a sharp warning. The lesson to be drawn is not that shock
therapy has been tried and failed. It is that it has not really been tried,
that not trying has failed and that a shock therapy which just might succeed
must now be tried. What is needed is not more therapy and less shock, but
more shock and more therapy.
It has been obvious since the failure of the coup in August 1991 that reform
in Russia would enjoy but a short window of opportunity. If the opportunity
was let slip, the collapsed Soviet Union was likely to turn into a
simulacrum of the former Yugoslavia, but an order of magnitude bigger. Mr
Zhirinovsky's electoral success demonstrates that this danger is not a
theoretical one. If the Russian people do not begin to feel hope soon, they
may indeed elect a government of xenophobic reactionaries who would enjoy
the ability to blow up the planet.
The natural response to the cry of pain from the Russian electorate is to
blame its suffering on shock therapy. But it would be the wrong response.
Russians are not suffering from shock therapy. They are suffering from a
malady to which no therapy has yet been seriously applied. That malady is
the collapse of the Soviet political and economic system.
If voters are calling for a return to the past, there is no remedy to offer.
If they are calling for a better future, fast reform is the only remedy.
What, after all, do voters seem to want? They want more food. They want an
end to corruption. They want secure jobs. They want a currency they can
trust. None of these things is achievable without reform.
Rewarding prices
If consumers are to enjoy more food, farmers must enjoy rewarding prices,
while the distribution system must be made more competitive. If legal
business is to thrive, the old Soviet principle that everything is forbidden
which is not permitted must be replaced by the rule of law. If workers are
to have secure jobs, they must work for businesses that satisfy market
demand, not the planners. If the people are to possess a currency they can
trust, rather than one which loses 90 per cent of its value in a year, the
government budget must be financed in a non-inflationary way.
Achieving any of these changes demands radical reform. The slower the
reforms, the more slowly will come the benefits. In the meantime, Russia
would remain in economic chaos. That would not be anything new, since
half-hearted reform has, in effect, been the policy of the past two years.
Those compromises have demonstrably failed, both economically and
politically. If that is not warning enough, there are also the examples of
Ukraine and Romania, which have been reformed even more slowly and are in a
still more dreadful state.
The challenge is to devise and implement a programme of radical reform that
is also politically acceptable. Only close co-operation between Moscow and
the west can make that combination conceivable. Without western financial
support, there is probably no politically tolerable programme. Without
determination in Moscow, which has not been in evidence since the election,
nothing at all can be achieved. At present, however, both parties look
likely to fall short. Mr Yeltsin does not dare enough, while the west does
not seem to care enough.
Market economy
The core of such a programme must be acceleration of the move to the market.
To privatisation, the great success of the past two years, must be added
further rapid moves towards a legal basis for the market economy. There must
also be sufficient monetary discipline to provide a currency worth striving
for. An economy may survive inflation at 20 per cent a year. No economy can
thrive with inflation at 20 per cent a month.
Inflation is a monetary phenomenon. The Russian central bank's argument that
the monopolised economy rather than itself is mainly to blame for inflation
is nonsense. It should stop printing money. But since the government cannot
raise taxes to cover the demands upon it, that is at present impossible.
If the west wants the economic benefits of the shock, it must provide the
wherewithal to finance the therapy. In particular, it must help support the
incomes of workers who are already unemployed in fact, but may soon be
unemployed for all to see.
Russia's path to perdition starts off looking relatively comfortable, while
the path of hope is steep. It is the one that combines radical reform with
generous western finance of politically essential current expenditures,
including a social safety net. Designing the details of such a path can be
delegated to western international agencies. But the decision on whether or
not to follow it can only be taken by Mr Yeltsin and western heads of
government. They have been given a salutary warning. Either they act
decisively now or they risk turning an evident danger into a disaster.

Paraguay's football league championship - now being decided by ballot after

In 1984 the Brazilian soccer authorities decided on a promotion from a lower
division after a similar bagunco, or foul-up. The method was to draw
numbered balls from a bag. Bangu, a Rio de Janeiro club, won with number
nine.
The superstitious inhabitants of Rio - for whom nine is a lucky number  -
went wild next day, betting heavily on combinations of nines in the illegal
but widely played numbers game, where nine was also represented by a snake
for the many players who are innumerate.
The bicheiros, the bankers of the game, held their breath . . . and nine did
not appear in any winning combination. But then bookies and snakes have all
the luck . . .

Why are New York ticket agencies now charging Irish world cup soccer fans
IPounds 250 for tickets with a face value 10 times less? At yesterday's
exchange rates IPounds 250 should fetch some Dollars 330; even New York
banks don't have such usurious currency exchange charges.
The explanation is entirely appropriate for the land where supply and demand
laws reign supreme. The Dublin-based Football Association of Ireland expects
to get 8,000 tickets for each of Ireland's three first-round games in June,
but some 20,000 fans are likely to flock to the US to watch their team.
By May, IPounds 250 might look ridiculously cheap . . .

Speakers scheduled for the opening sessions include Mikhail Gorbachev,

Others awarded slots during the following days include George Soros, Karl

There is only one snag. None of the listed eminences has yet signed up to

Not only has he established that the Bank's quarterly inflation report can

earth-shattering change to the Bank's quarterly bulletin. In a bid to turn
its turgid and technical prose into a showcase for Bank research,
contributors are being promised bylines in next month's edition.
Hacks at The Economist who have laboured on unsigned articles since 1843 may
be less than thrilled that Pennant-Rea's new editorial staff have been

Scientists and statisticians have really got it in for short people. First
US eggheads tell us that taller members of a university class are more

Then their colleagues inform us that 18 of the last 22 men elected to be US

British boffins are little kinder. What do we learn but that the average
British bishop is 1 3/4 inches taller than his parsons, while the Medical
Research Council warns that a 5ft tall man is twice as likely to suffer from
heart disease as a man 6ft tall.
Now, at an occupational psychology conference this week, another researcher
suggests that tall, thin men are more likely to succeed in management. Tuvia
Melamed of the University of Central Lancashire says that although tall, fat
women had just as good a chance as tall, thin ones, a trim waist was a
definite plus for men. He added: 'Generally the taller the person, the more
successful they are.'

FT  07 JAN 94 / A break in the siege mentality: Israel's economy is poised
to hasten the journey to the market, and reap a peace dividend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While western Europe is looking anxiously for signs of economic recovery
this year, Israeli policymakers are arguing not about the possibility of
growth but about the level of growth the economy can prudently sustain.
The intensity of the debate has been revealed by the war of words between
the two main economic bodies - the finance ministry, committed to returning
to the 6 per cent growth rates achieved in 1991 and 1992, and the central
bank, worried about a surge in inflation. But the fact that the argument,
sparked last week by an increase in interest rates to 10.5 per cent, has
been ignited in public is a sign that Israel is pondering the problems of
economic success, not failure.
The country now has the potential to be both the main beneficiary and the
driving economic force of a Middle East which, if a comprehensive peace with
all its neighbours is finally concluded, could be radically reshaped. But to
exploit the potential of a comprehensive regional peace accord, Israel must
undertake profound structural changes to speed up liberalisation and enable
it to reach out to new markets.
Despite the difficulties that are bound to confront attempts to reduce
unemployment and push through privatisation policies, there is a mood of
optimism among Israeli businessmen and bankers. Even before the
Israeli-Palestinian peace accord was signed in September, foreign investors
had reason to be sanguine. Although GDP growth slowed last year to 3.5 per
cent, mainly as a consequence of reduced house construction, the peace
process and the gradual deregulation of the state-dominated economy suggest
further expansion over the next two years. Officials are forecasting a
return to growth rates approaching 6 per cent.
Mr Shimon Peres, Israel's foreign minister, has spoken of a future in which
Israel might become the financial and commercial capital of the region. Gas
and oil pipelines would criss-cross the area, from Qatar across Saudi Arabia
to an export terminal at the Mediterranean port of Ashkelon, for example.
Roads and railways through Israel would connect the Middle East to Europe.
Israel would slash its 18bn shekel (Dollars 6bn) defence budget which
consumes 17 per cent of the annual budget in favour of investment in
infrastructure and social policies.
But not all Israelis scan the horizon with such optimism. The pessimists say
continuing Arab hostility towards Israel will severely limit the extent and
the timing of any peace dividends. Trade, they say, will be limited because
neighbouring Arab economies are significantly smaller than Israel's,
including, for example, Saudi Arabia. Regional infrastructure projects, even
if feasible, would take years to be developed. And defence savings are not
expected to be big in the short term because of the costs of redeployment
and updating military technology to maintain Israel's edge over old foes.
Assuming the peace negotiations make progress, the reality should fall
somewhere between these two visions. A recent report by Bank Hapoalim,
Israel's leading commercial banking group, said: 'Even the most cautious
evaluation finds that Israel will reap economic gains from the current peace
process; a more optimistic evaluation states that there will be a sharp
change in Israel's economic environment, ensuring fast expansion of its
economy for the next few years.'
The sector most likely to benefit in the immediate future is tourism. The
ministry of tourism expects arrivals to double from about 2m last year to 4m
by the year 2000. This year Israel is expected to earn more than Dollars 2bn
from tourism, representing about 25 per cent of foreign exchange receipts
from services. Any progress in achieving physically open borders would have
a rapid impact on tourism through the development of regional packages,
projects and promotion.
Second, on the trade front, Israeli economists say gains will accrue from an
eventual loosening of the Arab boycott against Israel, which has denied it
direct trade links with Arab states and also discriminated against
international companies trading with the Jewish state. Even limited Israeli
exports to Arab countries, and developments such as Israel being allowed to
import oil and gas from Arab states other than Egypt, would contribute to
economic growth by extending markets and reducing the transport costs of
hydrocarbons.
Third, an international perception of greater stability in the region would
lower Israel's risk rating as an investment centre. Israelis claim that
companies which have shied away are now interested in investing, and
possibly establishing regional headquarters in Tel Aviv.
So will Israel rise to the challenge offered by the peace process and
further reduce the traces of state domination of its economy?
There are several reasons for optimism. The hyperinflation and economic
instability of the early 1980s appear firmly in the past. A programme of
trade liberalisation, financial reforms and privatisation of state-owned
companies is being intensified, albeit at a pace that some find too slow.
Future growth should still be fuelled by the impact of US loan guarantees
worth Dollars 2bn a year over five years, which were provided to help ease
the absorption of half a million skilled Russian immigrants since 1989.
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin has placed responsibility for the economy in
the hands of committed reformers such as Mr Avraham Shochat, minister of
finance, Mr Jacob Frenkel, governor of the Bank of Israel, and Mr Aharon
Foegel, finance ministry director-general.
The three are determined to steer the economy firmly towards the market.
Until Mr Rabin's election in 1992, growth was stimulated substantially by
the government's policy of building Jewish settlements in occupied Arab
land. That has now changed. Most of last year's 3.5 per cent growth is
largely a result of a 7 per cent increase in private consumption and a 10
per cent increase in exports in real terms.
'This year marks a significant change in the structure of our economic
growth,' said Mr Foegel. 'This type of growth is much more sustainable in
the long run than public sector-driven growth.'
Progress is also being made on the macro-economic front. Provisionally the
budget deficit is estimated to have been reduced to 3.2 per cent of GDP last
year from 4.9 per cent in 1992; unemployment last year decreased to 10.2 per
cent from 11.2 per cent in 1992; inflation came down to 11.5 per cent from
12 per cent, still too high for the central bank; and the value of shares
sold in privatisations rose to Dollars 1.3bn last year, from Dollars 450m in
1992.
The government wants to cut the budget deficit to 3 per cent of GDP this
year, curb inflation at 8 per cent and bring unemployment down to 9.4 per
cent. It also plans to extend its capital market reforms, continue to
liberalise foreign exchange policy towards full convertibility of the
shekel, speed up privatisation and tackle the rigid labour market.
Privatisation poses the most difficult challenge because of stiff opposition
from employees. Mr Foegel, however, says the government intends this year to
sell shares in three of the biggest state-owned companies: Bezeq, the
telephone company, Israel Chemicals and El Al, the state airline. The sale
of controlling stakes in four top Israeli commercial banks should also be
completed by mid-1995.
Opposition to reform is deep-seated, however, and the chances are high of
continuing labour unrest over privatisation. The former rightwing Likud
government, while theoretically more committed than Labour to the private
sector, baulked at a full-blown confrontation with the unions and would be
quick to seize on any troubles for Mr Rabin.
Plans to curb government spending could also prompt a backlash in a country
with a 45-year history of generous welfare provision, protectionism and
fragile coalition politics. Spending cuts would entail a review of Israeli
welfare and education programmes and confrontation with the large social
lobby in the Knesset (parliament).
'We are still an excessively regulated and taxed economy,' said Mr Danny
Gillerman, president of the Israel Chamber of Commerce. 'We have to reform
Israel in line with the rest of the world, moving from a society of Marx and
Engels to a society of Marks and Spencer.'
Now that the main external obstacles that made Israel a virtual siege
economy are falling away, a real chance exists to create a society of Marks
and Spencer. Israel appears to be grasping the nettle and Labour may prove
the party that finally leads the country to peace with its neighbours. But
it has a lot to do before it can claim to have changed its own economic
philosophy, and with it the prospective living standards of its people.

FT  07 JAN 94 / Personal View: Bogus tests and classroom bedlam
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LORD SKIDELSKY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
So mind-numbing has been the debate in the UK over the national curriculum
and its testing arguments, so punch drunk the teachers and government, that
all and sundry have rushed to hail Sir Ron Dearing as the great educational
peacemaker. But his final report, published on Wednesday ('Education
overhaul accepted by Patten', January 6), has produced only the sketch of
his proposed peace treaty. In education, success or failure lies in the
detail, and the person who paints only with a broad brush will come a
cropper.
In two areas Sir Ron has produced sensible suggestions. Teachers have
complained endlessly about curriculum overload and over-prescription. The
Dearing report proposes to increase the teaching time available for the core
subjects of English, maths and science by reducing the compulsory element of
all the other subjects. This is also expected to free up about 20 per cent
of the timetable for locally chosen options. National tests at ages seven,
11 and 14 will also be confined to the core subjects. This is a neat way of
reconciling the government's demand for greater concentration on the core
with teachers' demands for greater freedom of choice. Whether the timetable
arithmetic will work out as Sir Ron envisages is far from clear.
More significant is the proposal that pupils between 14 and 16 should be
able to choose between 'academic', 'vocational' and 'occupational' pathways
in preparation for the post-16 study. This marks a big retreat from the
comprehensive ideal of a 'broad' curriculum to 16, tested by a single
school-leaving examination (GCSE). Sir Ron acknowledges that children differ
in ability and interests, and that making them study for too long the same
things in the same way is a recipe for boredom at the top and rebellion at
the bottom. Did we really have to go through the whole turbid process to
realise what in continental Europe has always been accepted as commonsense?
The report is weakest on methods of testing. Sir Ron's courage failed him,
because he has been baffled by the technical arguments. He accepts that the
existing 10-level testing scale is hopeless. But instead of advising that it
be scrapped he asks for three months to improve it. The 10 levels, he
suggests, should run only from ages five to 14; there should be fewer
attainment targets for each subject; individual statements of attainment
might be clustered into 'level descriptors'.
Until the intellectual weaknesses of the testing system are properly
understood, it will continue to unravel, and ministers will always be
wondering why. The statutory testing model, based on criterion referencing,
implies that judgments about pupils' performances in school subjects are
analogous to judgments about athletes' performances in athletic activities.
That is, there exist agreed sets of skills for each subject; there are
discrete levels of these skills which can be arranged hierarchically and
precisely stated; tests can be set which measure accurately the level
achieved; and the children build up skills in the order presupposed by the
levels.
All or some of these propositions are more or less false for all school
subjects, nowhere more than in argument-based subjects, where performance
needs to be judged through extended pieces of writing. My own experience on
the Schools Examination and Assessment Council convinced me that attempts to
set tasks (tests) against the required skills in history and English
literature lead to fatuous questions in the papers: questions which do not
arise naturally from the material being studied, and which no examiner would
dream of setting unless required to by law. Teachers are forced to fit their
subject teaching to the requirements of these bogus criteria. Tinkering with
a system which is logical, if unworkable, runs the risk of making it
illogical, without making it workable.
Sir Ron argues that to try anything else would be a dangerous experiment,
and that teachers are entitled to a period of peace. But it is the
criterion-referenced system which is the dangerous experiment. It was never
needed. There are well-established standardised tests for literacy and
numeracy - the foundational skills - as well as conventional examinations
for all subjects. And you cannot build stability on bedlam. The system will
collapse because it is intellectually unsound. Why not honestly admit the
mistake now, and use your powers of persuasion to win consent for something
which will work? This is the challenge Sir Ron has shirked.

FT  07 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Question mark over threat of patent
case to multi-media industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN R DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Having read the article, 'Strong feelings over patent dispute'
(Technology, December 2) by Tom Foremski and Louise Kehoe, I have kept a
close watch on developments relating to Compton's NewMedia's broad US patent
covering most multi-media products.
Just before Christmas two matters which arose could affect the impact of
this patent in the UK. First, in confirmation of the generally accepted view
that computer programs as such are not patentable under UK law, a report of
Raytheon Co's Application was published in the reports of patent cases. This
concerned a patent application for a computerised system for recognising the
outlines of ships. It was rejected by the English Patents Court as being a
program for a computer which simply performed an act which could otherwise
be performed mentally. The outcome of this case supports the view held by
most multi-media producers that Compton's NewMedia's patent is invalid since
it merely claims a computerised way of browsing through an inter-related set
of words and pictures, for instance an encyclopaedia.
Second, and perhaps more importantly, it was announced on December 16 by the
US Patent and Trade Marks Office that it would be 're-examining' Compton's
NewMedia's patent. Apparently, new material has been brought to the
attention of the US Patent Office which was not considered during the
original process of examination.
Additionally, I understand that the US Patent Office will be reconsidering
the obviousness of the invention. It appears that, unusually, the US Patent
Office has decided to initiate the re-examination on its own behalf as a
result of the storm of controversy caused by the grant of the patent.
Should the US Patent Office reject Compton's NewMedia's patent on
re-examination it may be that it will not represent the threat to the
multi-media industry that multi-media producers have feared. However, I
understand that there are a number of other similar patents in the process
of examination in the US and in Europe and that this will therefore
represent only a first skirmish in the battle for control and exploitation
of the multi-media industry in the 1990s.

FT  07 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: What pursuit of efficiency fails to
consider
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GRAHAM HALLETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, There have recently been many reports of job losses in various
industries, which are invariably welcomed in your columns as a sign of
improved 'productivity', or 'efficiency'.
Is this necessarily so? The British coalmines which have been closed are set
to cause serious river pollution ('Abandoned pits pour out a toxic threat',
December 22). Most of the displaced miners will remain unemployed, and the
bill for imported coal will rise sharply.
In the Post Office, the fall in the numbers of counter workers which is
promised after privatisation will mean that there will be no time to give
advice to old ladies. In 'social housing', 'efficiency' means building the
largest number of housing units possible with the (small and falling) amount
of public subsidy available, irrespective of the needs of the tenants,
architectural merit or long-term maintenance costs. And so on, in industry
after industry.
Does not the ruthless pursuit of a narrowly defined 'efficiency' which now
dominates public policy leave many important matters out of account?

FT  07 JAN 94 / The FT Interview: Stable hand on the reins - Peter Davies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Peter Davis last bet on a horse two or three years ago and does not do
the football pools; his business career has been characterised by more than
an average degree of prudence. 'I am a solid, middle-aged chartered
accountant,' he says with a laugh.
Such characteristics - combined with a previous form that includes the
deputy chairmanships of Abbey National, the banking and financial services
group; of Sturge Holdings, the insurance and stockbroking company; and of
Harris Queensway, the retailer - should put the stamp of integrity on what
will be the UK's biggest game of chance.
As director-general of the National Lottery, the regulatory body that will
choose a licensee to run a series of gambling contests, Mr Davis, 51, will
have the distinction of ending the UK's isolation as the only country in
Europe without a National Lottery. The second last was Albania.
If all goes well, the lottery should have a turnover of between Pounds 3bn
and Pounds 4bn within three years of its launch, probably early next year.
It will raise as much as Pounds 1bn a year for the five nominated good
causes, each of which will get an equal slice - the arts, charities, the
national heritage, sport and a fund to celebrate the millennium.
'I think it's going to add a dimension to our public life. It's going to be
a ray of sunshine in what is a pretty grey and drab world for the British
public,' says Mr Davis.
Applicants for the licence to run this substantial business are already
lining up. 'Expressions of interest' are required by January 14, with the
deadline for applications a month later. Mr Davis has promised to declare
the winner by May as long as he is not swamped by an unexpectedly large
number of runners.
The field - either formally declared or highly likely - includes: Camelot, a
consortium backed by Cadbury Schweppes; the Great British Lottery Company,
including Granada and Carlton Communications; Ladbrokes, with Lord Hollick's
financial services and media group MAI; the Lottery Foundation put together
by Virgin chairman Richard Branson (the only applicant pledged to handing
over all profits to a charitable foundation); Rainbow, a consortium being
put together by BAT chairman Sir Patrick Sheehy; the Rank Organisation; NM
Rothschilds, the merchant bank, with Australian lottery operator
Tattersalls; and the Tote, which operates horse racing's pooled betting
system, with Thorn EMI. There are also believed to be two more, so far
undeclared.
Making clear his determination to get the best deal for good causes - after
checking the propriety and security of each system, he is obliged to
maximise the amount raised - Mr Davis has written a reserve price for the
licence on a piece of paper and locked it in a lawyer's safe. It specifies
the maximum amount (as a percentage of sales) a licensee may retain to cover
costs and profits after the Treasury takes its 12 per cent cut, and the
minimum percentage the operator must hand over for good causes.
'The most important factor in any bid will be: 'Tell us how much you are
going to give us for good causes.' It will be a very tight judgment. You're
dealing with percentages . . . It is certainly not impossible that it will
be a very small difference.'
In the job for only four months, Mr Davis has been keen also to maximise the
chances of the lottery becoming a success for the operator, as well as in
terms of money raised. 'I would give him an alpha,' said one applicant who,
not wanting to appear obsequious, asked not to be named.
Mr Davis acknowledges that the draft plan he inherited from the National
Heritage Department was of a high intellectual quality, but adds: 'In a
number of respects it was lacking in commercial input.'
He declines to list all the changes he made but some were announced publicly
after consultations with potential licensees. For instance, Mr Davis agreed
applicants should be given the right to publish as many, or as few, details
of their bids as they wanted to, overturning an earlier insistence on
confidentiality.
He also removed a requirement that each applicant should specify a minimum
payment to charity each year - several applicants had suggested they might
not bid if they had to make such a commitment in advance. Mr Davis also
reduced the penalty for pulling out before the seven-year licence expires.
He is at home with such minutiae. 'An accountant's stock-in-trade is
details, numbers, paper,' he says. But in his past career he has also seen
himself as a 'bridge', putting into practice the ideas of flamboyant
characters such as Sir Phil Harris of Harris Queensway and Mr David
Coleridge, chairman of Sturge, and liaising with line managers.
'I have always liked being the bridge between the operator and the
professional management of the business,' says Mr Davis who presciently
decided to leave Harris Queensway in 1987, a couple of years before the
company's difficulties became apparent.
He regards his latest 'absolutely fascinating and unique job' as a
philanthropic mission. It gives him a first taste of the public sector and
its pay scales. His Pounds 80,000-a-year salary is much lower than he could
command in the private sector.
He is circumspect about how much might be raised for charity, refusing to go
beyond a forecast by Mr Peter Brooke, national heritage secretary, that the
lottery should have revenues of around Pounds 1.5bn a year. Most specialists
believe that is an underestimate.
Nevertheless Mr Davis agrees the signs are auspicious. 'We as a nation like
gambling. We like our fun game. I think there is every reason to assume it
will be very successful provided we can set up the right people and the
right marketing.'
Another omen is also favourable. In Ireland recently, Mr Davis bought a
IPounds 2 lottery ticket to see how the successful Irish lottery worked. The
ticket won him a prize of IPounds 3. The challenge now is to prove he can
pick a winner to run the UK's national lottery.

FT  07 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: The unheeded signs at MG
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MARTIN E SIMONS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader, 'When a system breaks down' (December 21), was a pertinent
comment on the grave debacle at Metallgesellschaft, the extent of whose
problems you outlined in your report, 'Metallgesellschaft reveals losses of
almost DM2bn' (January 6). More needs to be said, though, about the
foolhardiness of MG's enormous expansion since 1989 which does not seem to
have been fully appreciated.
This is illustrated by the disastrous acquisition and subsequent divestment
of Schiess at great cost. MG's sale of 12.5 per cent of Kolbenschmidt in
October 1993, whereby it turned an important partly-owned, geared and
loss-making subsidiary into an associate, was a clear indication of
developing problems. However, this was apparently not adequately heeded by
principal shareholders and investment analysts. And this was well before MG
was hit by problems in the US triggered by falling oil prices.
The extraordinary scale of acquisitions and divestments, accompanied by
uncovered dividend payments, would have stretched the most competent of
managements and was surely doomed to failure. Some deals should have been
vetoed by MG's bank shareholders, notwithstanding their loss of what were
presumably substantial investment banking fees.

FT  07 JAN 94 / At risk from party politics: German growth requires a subtle
policy mix
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KLAUS FRIEDRICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The German economy has had a very bad press during the past few months. It
seems exaggeration is the name of the game. In good times, people speak of
economic miracles. In bad times such as these, 'worst ever' commentary
abounds. Anyone who has observed west Germany's very high living standards,
in particular the high consumption of luxury goods and the relative
generosity of public services, will have difficulty in accepting
Gotterdammerung scenarios.
Germany is, after all, in the midst of a historic development project,
namely the integration of east Germany. Net transfers from west to east  -
amounting to 5 per cent of German gross domestic product - have been the
equivalent of what would be, in normal times, the annual increase in western
incomes. These transfers are helping to build a new infrastructure in east
Germany. They are also being used to support consumption during the period
that east German manufacturing undergoes a lengthy, but necessary,
adjustment process.
For west Germans, the prospect of sacrificing increases in their real
incomes for several years is no cause for joy. They now realise they cannot
have their reunification cake and eat it too. But the transfer is an
investment for the future, a huge national savings programme that will pay
off when the east produces as much as it consumes. On that day, a good part
of Germany's present structural problems will be solved.
Germany's challenges have been made more complex by the need to reorientate
its economy towards the east. Other problems, such as high structural
unemployment, seem common to most west European countries.
At present, west Germany has 2.5m registered unemployed. In east Germany,
the number is 1.2m. This excludes workers in jobs subsidised with public
funds. In 1994 production and demand will increase moderately, but not
enough to reverse companies' programmes of labour shedding. Unemployment is
thus likely to rise further in west Germany. In east Germany, on the other
hand, unemployment appears to be stabilising, albeit at a high level.
In view of the present structure of the German labour market, a growth rate
well over 3 per cent would be necessary to stabilise overall employment.
Thus the ending of the downturn will not end the political problems caused
by rising unemployment. This apparent inconsistency is reflected in a
booming stock market at a time when much of the electorate is still feeling
the impact of recession.
The good economic news is that west Germany has been growing at an
underlying annual rate of 2 per cent since the spring of 1993. Productivity
in many enterprises is rising, while the increase in unit costs has been
slowing.
The inflation outlook has improved steadily. Producer and import prices have
been falling and are now feeding into the cost-of-living index, which in
recent months has been increasing at an annual rate of about 2.5 per cent.
The 1994 wage round is likely to lead to far lower settlements for 1994 than
last year.
In view of the subdued economic growth and low capacity utilisation, it is
not surprising that price pressures from the demand side are practically
non-existent. The inflation rate is, however, being increased by rises in
indirect taxation, administered prices and general levies.
The new surtax on petrol, which came into effect on January 1, will add as
much as 0.5 percentage points to the cost-of-living index this month.
Nevertheless, there is a good chance that inflation will ease further in the
course of 1994, giving an average increase over last year of less than 3 per
cent.
Germany's inflation performance is the most important determinant of the
Bundesbank's interest rate policy. The faster inflation slows, the better
the case for interest rate reductions. Later in 1994, when the year-on-year
increase in the cost-of-living index falls to below 3 per cent, the
Bundesbank's interest rates are likely to have fallen by a further 2
percentage points from their current level.
On the capital markets, the level of German interest rates is already
remarkably low by past standards. As a result of the high credibility of the
Bundesbank's anti-inflation policy, foreigners have made large-scale
purchases of German bonds.
The Bundesbank has taken great care to avoid any action which would disturb
the long end of the market. In particular, it has rejected any hurried cuts
in short-term interest rates, preferring to rely on its policy of
Trippelschritte (cutting rates in 'dribbles').
There is little doubt that this policy will be continued in 1994, with a key
role likely to be played by the exchange rate. Two opposing factors are at
work here. On one hand, German exporters have lost international
competitiveness as a result of the sharp real appreciation of the D-Mark
over the past year - a factor which would point to a weakening D-Mark. On
the other hand, in view of the need to attract inflows of foreign capital to
sustain the fall in long-term interest rates, the Bundesbank places
considerable importance on maintaining a firm D-Mark.
This delicate balance of objectives would best be achieved by stable
currency relationships within the European Monetary System. Although most
countries have now shifted to wide bands after the August currency upsets,
the currencies of some of Germany's most important EMS partners have now
moved back into the former narrow bands.
As long as this relative stability in Europe is maintained, the prospect of
a moderately stronger dollar is unlikely to disturb opportunities for a
further drop in German short-term interest rates.
In view of the proliferation of national and regional elections in Germany
this year, 1994 brings political risks. The general election in October
seems at present unlikely to result in a clear victory for a party of the
traditional left or right. Rather, we may see the formation of a coalition
government, comprising either the two main parties - the Christian Democrats
and Social Democrats - or a larger group of parties with divergent
positions.
In either case, the government which takes office at the end of the year
will have difficulties formulating and implementing a clear economic policy
 -a factor likely to have a progressively important impact on the 1994
outlook.

FT  07 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Valuations may hit pensions smoothing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ROBERT C ROSS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Gordon Clark (Letters, January 6) makes the important point that the
financial health of a pension fund is measured by the difference between the
value of its assets and the value of its liabilities. The actual performance
of the assets per se is far less signifIcant than the development of the
funding level.
Mr Clark draws attention to the fact that the rate of increase in market
values of pension assets in 1993 has exceeded the rate of increase in
actuarial value of assets by almost 30 per cent. The reason that actuaries
value pension fund assets by discounting future dividend flows to a present
value is to smooth the 'aberrations' of market movements.
The benefit of this approach is that short-term market movements do not
necessitate changes to long-term contribution rates which may subsequently
be reversed.
Over a long period of time one would expect the actuarial and market values
to converge - they are both heading to the same place but the former,
hopefully, will have a smoother path. However, the comfort which this
smoothing provides may be illusory. If the path of actuarial values diverges
from that of market values, then this must mean that the actuary's
assumptions about dividend growth were wrong because they have been shown to
be inconsistent with events in the market. The actuary will revise his
assumptions to move his valuation back in line with that of the market,
causing a discontinuity in the actuarial value and potentially a
corresponding shift in the recommended contribution rate. Thus there is a
danger that the suppression of fluctuations in market value in the
short/medium term will be released at intervals in the longer term,
obviating the apparent benefits of trying to smooth out the real world.
If prevailing actuarial assumptions are maintained, then many year-end 1993
asset valuations will be as much as 25 per cent below market values.
This may cause some actuaries (if not yet their clients) to consider whether
they are still heading along the wrong track. A recommendation to end a
contribution holiday because credit is only being given for 75 per cent of
the market's valuation of the fund's assets may not be well received in some
quarters.

FT  07 JAN 94 / Arts: Drawn from Chinese life today - Lynn MacRitchie finds
the image of China's New Man, self-assured as never before
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LYNN MACRITCHIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Collectors have responded favourably to the contemporary Chinese figurative
paintings now on show at the Marlborough Gallery. 'They are buying them
because they like them,' said a gallery representative, and it is easy to
see why: all the artists are competent painters or printmakers.
China was perhaps the only culture before modern times to appreciate, in the
works of its traditional ink and wash painters, the essentially abstract
qualities of brush work. After 1949, the Communist regime imported into
China's art schools the methods of their Soviet brethren, so that for the
first time China came face to face with academic realism. The legacy of
Socialist Realism, which required artists to be skilled in representing the
human figure in poses convincing in form if unlikely in content, continues
in its art schools to this day. Thus China produces excellent painters,
skilled in the use of oils in a manner often mourned as lost in the west and
able to draw the human figure and its surroundings with confidence and
skill.
The Marlborough show is a miniature version of the major exhibition first
seen at the Hanart Gallery, Hong Kong, early last year, curated by Johnson
Chang who has played a vital role in bringing China's contemporary art to
the attention of the west. Some of the work was also seen at the New Art
from China exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in Oxford this autumn.
Most of the paintings are expertly done, their subjects recognisable, their
content, based on aspects of contemporary Chinese life, intriguing.
The differences between them are also intriguing, and lead to speculation as
to how the work of painters in China will develop in future. Two strong
tendencies are evident: a gritty naturalism, best exemplified by Liu Wei and
also demonstrated by Liu Xiaodong, Xia Xiaowan, Wang Jianwei and Zeng Fanzhi
and 'Political Pop', of which Wang Guangyi is the leading exponent.
The paintings of Wang, who is nicknamed 'China's Andy Warhol' for his clever
amalgamation of images recalled from the posters of the Cultural Revolution
with the brand names of Western products, are attractive to a western
audience: they combine what westerners still expect to see in Chinese images
 -Red Guards waving banners and Little Red Books - with the comforting proof
that consumerism has, after all, proved triumphant.
For some Chinese, however, these images are more thought provoking: many
view the onslaught of materialism with anxiety and dismay. Although
presently enjoying the trappings of his Pop-based success, Wang has shown
himself capable of radical switches in style. His work of the early 1980s
was minimalist, concerned with purity of form. His style changed as the
shifts in economic policy produced such dramatic social changes that 'a
response was necessary', he said. Wang had already worked through a series
using images of Chairman Mao in the mid-1980s before beginning the current
series, known as the 'Great Criticism', in 1990.
Others working in the pop style such as Yu Youhan, Li Shan or Wang Ziwei
continue to find the Great Helmsman a useful subject. An interesting twist
on Maoist themes is offered by Feng Mengbo, who in 'Game Over: RMBDollars
10', 1993, paints the workers, peasants and soldiers depicted on Renminbi
notes as the characters in a video game. This mocking response from one born
in the 1960s to the political class distinctions which had so devastating an
effect on his parents' generation typifies the rejection by the younger
generation of any kind of political philosophy, a state of mind which brings
young Chinese close to their European and US contemporaries in a way not
previously experienced.
While the necessity to work through the lexicon of Maoist symbols will fade,
the new realist painters, absorbed in recording their personal experience,
have managed to break with the demands of the state-sponsored art machine
while using the skills learned within it to make works which convey the
essence of everyday life. Their subjects are no longer political leaders or
spurious heroes but themselves, their friends and families, shown with an
accuracy which, though it can be shocking, is also compassionate. While Liu
Wei remains the master of meticulous mundanity, his family rendered, dirty
finger nails and all, in luscious paint, 'Family Portrait,' 1993, by Zhang
Xiaogang is striking in its tender melancholy.
Turning away from the cramped interiors and melancholy atmosphere evoked so
skilfully by his colleagues, Fang Lijun has evolved a style all his own,
part realist, part surrealist. A grisaille canvas, one of a series produced
this summer, which shows a simple image, based on a photograph of the artist
submerged in a swimming pool, is the most thought provoking painting in the
show. Illuminated by sunlight through the water, the figure confronts the
viewer bald, naked and alone, hand raised in a laconic 'peace' sign.
In a country in which social stability has been most reliably maintained
through the ties of family obligations, surviving even the Maoist onslaught
of younger against older generations, the self-contained individual,
responsible to no one, is a truly frightening figure. This ghostly grey
image could be seen as a metaphor for China's latest version of the New Man,
no longer socialist, no longer political, the lone young operator of the
1990s. Self-assured as never before, he looks out at the world and, frankly,
he doesn't give a damn. Aged leaders, beware.

FT  07 JAN 94 / Arts: Small stages deliver the goods - Theatre in 1993
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If there was a theme to theatre in Britain in 1993 - and there is absolutely
no reason why there has to be - it was diversity. I remember all sorts of
pleasures, but there was no pattern. The main impression is how much theatre
there is: old plays rediscovered, imports from Europe and America, and the
odd new talent at home.
Quite the best production of anything I saw in Britain this year was the
Deutsches Theater performing Heinrich von Kleist's Der Zerbrochne Krug (The
Broken Jug) at the tail-end of the Edinburgh Festival. As a play, it is
relatively slight: a genial expose of the law in a Dutch village at the
beginning of the 19th century, and indeed of the law in general. It borrows
from Falstaff and foreshadows Kafka. Yet the direction by Thomas Langhoff
showed how much can be done with a light piece by paying loving attention to
detail and bringing out even the smallest characters. This is the standard
of excellence one needs to have in mind while watching home-made products,
however good.
Some of the most enjoyable indigenous performances were also light in touch.
The funniest was Anorak of Fire by Stephen Dinsdale, which came straight to
the Arts Theatre in London from Edinburgh. The piece is simply the ramblings
of a Yorkshire train-spotter who spots a lot else besides.
Yorkshire shone again when the Yorkshire Theatre Company brought Brian B
Thompson's Derby Day to the Cockpit, which has emerged as one of the best of
London's small theatres. The company mixes modern acting styles with
old-fashioned humour: the actors play the horses as well as the people.
What Anorak and Derby Day have in common is that they are good-natured plays
about unlikely subjects, and unusually well done. They bring the welcome
effect of surprise. In a similar way I admired The Lion by Michael
Abbensetts at the Cochrane. This is a political play, but the politics are
those of the Caribbean, exiled in England: the style might be drawn from
Noel Coward. The Talawa Theatre Company, which produced it, is bringing new
voices into the English theatre.
There was a different surprise at the Bush, where Keyboard Skills by Lesley
Bruce, was not unduly hostile to the Conservative Party and treated Tory
women with sympathy: rather more respect than Tory men. Laughter, but not
cruel laughter, is coming back.
There were more serious matters, of course. One of the outstanding
performances of the year was Penelope Wilton as Hester in the revival of
Terence Rattigan's The Deep Blue Sea at the Almeida. The scene where her
husband comes back, they talk affectionately, but she still rejects him, is
among the most emotional in English drama.
Equally welcome was the triumph of Robert Stephens in Adrian Noble's
production of King Lear at Stratford. This is a quiet Lear who knows he is
going mad and does so at times with a beatific smile. After his performances
as Falstaff in the same theatre a year ago, Stephens has re-emerged in the
forefront of British acting.
The up-and-coming star is clearly Alan Cumming who has had two consecutive
successes, first as Hamlet, now as the master of ceremonies in Cabaret which
is still running at the Donmar Warehouse. Cumming has a light frame, a
strange gnome-like face and body which he knows how to use. Playing Hamlet
with a Scottish accent was a perfect way of showing how the Prince of
Denmark differs from everyone else in the court. Cumming is probably the
Alec Guinness of the future.
There is also something about the place: the Donmar seats less than 300
people. It is one of the very few small theatres in a relatively smart part
of London. But perhaps it is the size rather than the location that matters.
Nearly all the best productions in the last year or so have come from the
smaller stages, whether the Almeida in Islington, the Gate in Notting Hill,
the Bush at Shepherd's Bush or the Orange Tree in Richmond. There is a
string of others slightly less well-known.
The two main subsidised theatres - the RSC and the RNT - are also using
their smaller stages well. Schiller's Wallenstein would never have found an
audience in the main Barbican; at the Pit it played to perfection - and to
near capacity. Tony Kushner's Angels in America is playing, again to
capacity, at the Cottesloe, not one of the RNT's bigger arenas.
Angels is one of a number of American pieces that caught the eyes and ears.
David Mamet's Oleanna, first at the Royal Court and now at the Duke of
York's (with a new cast from January 11), achieved what must be a
playwright's ultimate dream - making people talk about it long after they
had seen it. Arthur Miller showed in The Last Yankee at the Young Vic that
he is writing as well in his late 70s as he was nearly 50 years before when
he produced Death of a Salesman.
The Americans, at their best, have a talent for dialogue which eludes most
living Englishmen, save perhaps Harold Pinter, who directs Oleanna, has
experience of screen-plays and gave us his own new piece in Moonlight. Well
done, this first Pinter play of any length for 15 years is terrific: a lot
depends on the timing and an audience ready to listen.
The contrast between American and English writing comes up again in the
RNT's bold decision to stage two national epics more or less simultaneously:
Kushner's Angels alongside David Hare's trilogy about the established
church, the law and the Labour Party in Britain. Perhaps America simply is a
livelier place. Anyway, where Kushner scores is in his ability to be both
witty and moving. The waltz between the two male lovers at the end of
Millennium Approaches is pure pathos. Hare builds big scenes on a big stage,
but is ultimately short on feeling. His characters are what E M Forster
would have called 'flat'.
There were other, extraneous delights. Two big American musicals, Crazy for
You and City of Angels, fought it out for audiences and unfortunately the
better one lost, though not without winning a reprieve. When it was
announced that City was closing, there was a sudden rush for tickets, which
kept it going for another few weeks.
Shakespeare returned to Shaftesbury Avenue with an uproariously funny
production of Much Ado About Nothing where Benedick (Mark Rylance) was a
plain blunt Ulsterman. Maggie Smith made a little bit of theatre history in
The Importance of Being Earnest at the Aldwych by letting the famous handbag
line go through to the wicket-keeper, then hitting the next one ('the line
is immaterial') for six.
Donald Sinden (who must be knighted if a theatrical tradition and a proper
use of honours are to be maintained) is still playing in a thoroughly
enjoyable revival of She Stoops to Conquer at the Queen's, and it was
pleasing to see Oliver Goldsmith's other play, The Good Natur'd Man,
appearing at the Orange Tree. I would like to believe that this was an act
of cooperation between a West End theatre and a smaller place slightly out
of town, but I think it was coincidence.
A final note: by the standards of most activities in Britain, the theatre is
remarkably efficient. Yet sometimes a little more co-ordination between who
is doing what and when might be helpful - not Macbeth at the RNT and the
RSC, and not too many openings on the same night.

FT  07 JAN 94 / Arts: Syncopated Weir - Recital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The special attraction in Susan Tomes's recital, at the Wigmore on
Wednesday, was a piece newly written for her by Judith Weir. Miss Weir is of
course the teasing composer of A Night at the Chinese Opera and many other
quirky things - among them, no doubt, her forthcoming Blond Eckbert for the
English National Opera. Miss Tomes is the pianist of the excellent Domus
trio, which boasts two Weir pieces in its repertoire.
In the new piano piece, called The King of France, Weir seems to have
remembered the Tomes penchant for Billy Mayerl: there were strong hints of
that toward the end of it. But her guiding inspiration was an ancient
Sephardic Jewish song, 'El Rey de Francia'; in fact The King is a set of 10
variations on it. The tune has a plangent ring and intriguing curves,
variously exploited and developed in the variations.
Often there are rude, syncopated basses; oddly fractured Weir(d)
piano-textures, too, and one big variation - grave and searching, with
sharply struck chords that linger on - with a kind of post-Romantic
eloquence. Some brusque transitions puzzled. I imagine that Miss Tomes will
be delivering The King of France with more persuasive confidence in a month
or two.
She was not really at her best on Wednesday. Her Mozart, the late, lovely
B-flat Sonata K. 570, was clean and alert, and the ornaments glittered, but
the whole seemed a touch self-effacing. There were excellent things in her
three Faure nocturnes, not least the unshakeable Tomes pulse, and yet the
tunes often sang too shyly to emerge from the figuration. She took the Third
Nocturne well below Faure's tempo, at some cost to its dance-spring and its
winsomeness, and in the little Eighth Nocturne the soft scales that wind
around the melody were not soft, but distractingly bright.
In spite of the evident affection and care that she lavished on Schubert's
great A major sonata, D959, it was not a very happy performance. The
sparkling Scherzo, at least, is right up the Tomes alley; but the Andantino
was wan, and the Finale sadly tame, without the energy to make the closing
teases even begin to work. The strenuous passages in the first two movements
sounded like hard, anxious work. A devoted audience applauded her anyway.

Inspiration for the last of BBC2's sequence of ballets created specially for
television, Dance For The Camera, was 'The Rime Of The Ancient Mariner'.
Choreography is by William Tuckett, the performers include Anthony Dowell
and Michael Nunn, and the verses are spoken by John Gielgud (8.15).
There are two new gardening series which, surprisingly, do not clash. In The
Great British Garden Show Ruth Langsford meets some of those who grow
flowers, fruit and vegetables for summer shows (8.30 BBC2). The moment that
ends C4 begins Nature Perfected (9.00) which is about the history of
gardening.
Fans of Red Dwarf, the comedy set in deep space, may want to set their VCRs
at 9.00 for Episode 1. This is the beginning of a repeat run of all six
series. At the same time ITV shows the opening episode in another batch of
The Chief, a police series about a chief constable which began strongly but
has deteriorated somewhat. In Further Abroad (9.30 BBC2) Jonathan Meades
continues his exploration of architectural odds and ends.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Soon after a glass of lager is poured the appealing bubbles on the top begin
to dissipate. Once the beer is inside the smooth-sided glass the carbon
dioxide remains dissolved in the fluid, rather than bursting to the top to
form bubbles.
A specialist glass company has found a way to roughen the inside base of the
glass so the carbon dioxide is released. Charles Glassware fixes glass
particles into the base and fires the glass at 580'C. The particles may form
a picture or logo. Charles Glassware: UK, 081 207 2888.

Every personal computer user knows the problem with training: a day after
the course and the intricacies of the software are easily understood; a
month later and the mental fog has descended.
To replace the need to look up procedures, training specialist Futuremedia,

the memory.
The Q-PC comprises a small black box, plugged in between the PC and
keyboard, and a cassette, on which is a voice interspersed with audio
'bleeps'. When the cassette is played on a personal stereo, connected to the
PC, the voice instructs the user while the 'bleeps' instruct the PC to
perform the task.
Futuremedia has cassettes to help with popular software packages, or can

FT  07 JAN 94 / Technology: General Magic's genie
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM FOREMSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After more than three years of development, California-based General Magic
yesterday introduced its new communications software technology based on the
concept of 'software agents' that will automatically perform set tasks.
The first products are Magic Cap, a graphical user interface (to simplify
screen instructions) for palm-sized personal communicator devices, and the
Telescript programming language. AT&amp;T, a General Magic shareholder, says it
is the first company to use Telescript as the basis for its PersonaLink
online service. General Magic's other shareholders include Apple Computer,
Motorola, Philips, Sony and Matsushita.
Users of Telescript can create 'software agents', self-contained programs
that roam communications networks delivering and receiving messages or
looking for information or services. 'With Telescript, you could create an
agent to check airline departure times and notify you if your aeroplane is
late. Or you could use agents to bid on products or services,' says Marc
Porat, president of General Magic.
Magic Cap enables users to access information and other services by pressing
tiny pictures of buildings. It is designed for the small touch-screens in
personal communicator devices, essentially high-tech versions of the
portable telephone combining fax, electronic mail and voice features.
Magic Cap includes Telescript and provides additional functions such as a
diary, address book and communications software. Motorola and Sony plan to
introduce Magic Cap-based personal communicator devices soon; the other
shareholders are expected to announce products based on General Magic's
technology later.
The technology may have arrived too late for Apple, which has several
development efforts that mirror General Magic's technology. Apple's new
online service, eWorld, does not use Telescript.
'We're interested in Telescript but it's not for us right now,' says Peter
Friedman, director of Apple Online Services. 'We'll take another look at
Telescript later in the year.' Porat says there will be Apple products based
on Magic Cap and Telescript in 1995.

FT  07 JAN 94 / Technology: Brainchild hidden in a basement - Jacques
Stern's dream of a European supercomputer is poised to become reality
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Behind a door marked simply 'Maintenance' in the drab basement of a tower
block in the city of Lyons, south-east France, a full-scale prototype of a
supercomputer sits incongruously.
It is evidence that the organisation several floors above, the four-year-old
Advanced Computer Research Institute (Acri), is chasing a dream, not a
fantasy. It is also proof that the European Union and a group of private
investors have something to show for some FFr315m (Pounds 36m) put into the
project since 1990.
By mid-1994, the EU's contribution will be Ecu30m (Pounds 23.6m). The dream,
that a European company could catch and compete with the rest of the world
in supercomputers, has been nurtured since the 1980s by Jacques Stern,
Acri's founder and chief executive.
A former chairman of Groupe Bull, the French state-owned computer
manufacturer, Stern has assembled in Acri a 200-strong multinational team
with the goal of developing a globally competitive product. 'We do not
suffer from the 'not invented here' syndrome,' he says. 'Our technology and
engineering can come from anywhere. If you do not think globally at the very
beginning, you will never succeed.'
Late last year, in Portland, Oregon, the company made its international
debut at a leading US supercomputing exhibition under its trading name
'Stern Computing Systems'. SCS also plans to market systems developed by its
strategic partners, including Digital Equipment of the US. Digital's 'Alpha'
microprocessor chip, said to be the world's fastest, is at the heart of the
Acri-1, the company's first machine scheduled for commercial launch this
year.
Some years ago, the idea of a European challenger in supercomputers would
have invited derision. The market was small and pioneering costs high.
Supercomputers were custom-built to squeeze power out of the available
technology, with no expense spared. The world leader was Cray Research of
the US, followed by the Japanese companies, NEC, Hitachi and Fujitsu.
Much has changed. Developments in microprocessor technology have created
minisupercomputers - computers nearly matching a Cray for power at a
fraction of the price - and massively parallel systems such as Thinking
Machines' Corporation's Connection Machine, in which hundreds, perhaps
thousands, of microprocessors are strung together to tackle a computing
problem co-operatively. Convex Computer Corporation of Dallas in the US was
a pioneer in minisupercomputers; significantly, Adrian Wise, a senior
vice-president at Convex, has now been appointed vice-president for sales
and marketing at Acri.
These smaller, less expensive, machines have dramatically altered the
supercomputer market. Companies like the UK's Meiko, which builds parallel
processors, have won sales in the US. Cray's share of the world market has
started to slip and it has been forced to develop cheaper computers.
So Acri is adopting the strategy of niche player, aiming at the
high-performance technical computing (HPTC) market. Here, supercomputers
model and simulate mechanical structures, environmental conditions, chemical
processes and natural phenomena.
Companies need this information to design new products and to prove they are
complying with regulations. Tor Bloch, Acri's chief operating officer, gives
as examples combustion engine and oil burner developments, ship hull
collision resistance and the resistance of electronic aviation systems to
lightning strikes.
Supercomputers capable of handling these problems typically cost between
Dollars 5m (Pounds 3.3m) and Dollars 6m. These are not machines designed for
so-called 'Grand Challenge' problems - modelling the behaviour of the oceans
or the atmosphere, for example - for which large Cray or Fujitsu machines
costing up to Dollars 30m are needed.
Bloch estimates the value of the HPTC market as Dollars 5.1bn in 1992,
growing to more than Dollars 6.7bn in 1997. He says Acri's attack on the
market will follow three guiding principles.
It will use the most advanced available technology. The octagonal frame,
some 2m high, houses six Alpha chips each capable of processing 64 bits of
data simultaneously, giving up to 8bn operations a second. Gallium arsenide,
three times faster than silicon but difficult to work with, is used for some
of the chips. The machine is not fast by supercomputer standards, but
combines the best elements of Cray-type systems and massively parallel
systems to give excellent price performance. Typically, the price of an Acri
machine will be Dollars 2m.
It will use reduced instruction set computing (risc) techniques which offer
the best performance for the price in the HPTC market. It will use open
systems or client-server designs and will make use of a standard operating
system, Digital's OSF-1 version of Unix. It has an agreement with Cray to
share a common scientific programming language (Fortran) which should reduce
time to market and open the door to existing technical applications
software.
It will be easy to use. Bloch points out that as demands for increased
performance rise, supercomputer designs will converge and ease of
programming will determine which ones will be successful.
Acri was created out of discussions between Stern, Bloch, then in charge of
the advanced computing group at the European Organisation for High Energy
Physics (Cern), and Alain Lichnewsky, in charge of science and technology
and formerly director of research at Inria, the French National Institute of
Research in Computer Science.
Acri's network of strategic alliances involves equity interests. It has a
shareholding in Acset, a small Belgian company which writes the software
which makes Acri's computers easy to program. Cray Research is also a
shareholder in Acset and has a strategic alliance with Acri. Digital
Equipment has shares in Acri as has CEA, the French atomic energy agency.
Acri plans to sell its machines directly in Europe and through partners in
the US and elsewhere. Now it faces a tough test. The technology, Tor Bloch
says, is proven but more money must be found to bring the first Acri
machines to market. The company must raise a further FFr200m. If it fails,
Europe's supercomputing dream could founder, not from lack of innovation or
entrepreneurial zeal, but for want of cash.

FT  07 JAN 94 / People: Another occupation for Carr
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Occupational Pensions Board, which oversees occupational pension
schemes, has a new chairman, despite recommendations in the Goode report on
pension law reform that the OPB be replaced by a regulatory body with much
wider powers.
Peter Carr, 62, chairman of the Northern Regional Health Authority and of
the County Durham Development Company, has been appointed for a three-year
term by Peter Lilley, secretary of state for social security, while the
government makes up its mind as to the sort of regulation required in an
immensely complicated area.
He succeeds Harriet Dawes who goes back to being deputy chairman. Dawes had
only been in the chair since September, when she adopted what she said at
the time was to be a caretaker role until the OPB's future became clearer.
A labour market economist who studied at Ruskin College, Oxford, Carr gained
a reputation during his nearly four-year stint at NRHA as an unusually
independent-minded chairman. In April, the NRHA and the more populous
Yorkshire Regional Health Authority, are set to merge. No announcement has
yet been made as to who will chair the combined entity, but Carr says that
the job he has been doing, while paid on the basis of three and a half days'
work a week, in practice requires him to be on hand day and night.
Carr's previous experience includes working at ACAS in its early days.
Between 1978 and 1983 he worked in Washington as labour attache, before
returning to become northern regional director of the Department of
Employment until 1989.
Parrying widespread criticism that the OPB has been ineffectual, the new
chairman says that it is a body containing a great deal of intelligence
about the pensions industry that has given government 'very wise and
soundly-based advice'. He chairs his first board meeting on Monday when the
board formulates its own response to the Goode report.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Post Office Counters, which among other activities is one of the bidders for
the UK's national lottery scheme, has made two senior appointments which
bolster its drive towards becoming more commercially-minded in its retail
operations.
David Walker, who joined British Airways in 1975 as a graduate trainee and
eventually became its commercial manager, will head a new business centre -
the branded markets business centre - which will be responsible for managing
the company's own label products, leading its national lottery bid and
increasing its share of the communications market. Besides the national
lottery bid, Walker, 40, sees the 175 post office shops as being a prime
area for future expansion and development.
Chester Wallace, has been appointed director of another new business centre
 -the agency development centre - designed to support post office agents and
franchisees.
In 1974, Wallace, 46, joined Allied Suppliers - which later became Argyll
Foods and was acquired by Safeway in 1987, the year he left to work in
retail management consultancy. Before this latest move he spent three years
with Touche Ross management consultancy, again working on the retail sector.
Post Office Counters - which in 1992 had income of Pounds 1.1bn - runs the
UK's 900 'crown office' post office outlets as well as the 18,000 sub-post
offices and post office franchises, the latter accounting for 75 per cent of
its business.

FT  07 JAN 94 / People: Old guard moves on at Simon
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
John Barker, 57, the man responsible for building Simon Engineering into the
world's biggest producer of powered access equipment, is the latest casualty
of the boardroom shake-out at the troubled engineering group.
Barker, who joined Stockport-based Simon in 1974, has resigned from the main
board and been replaced as managing director of Simon Access, Simon's second
biggest business, by Ron Wheeler, a US citizen, who joined Simon in 1988
after it took over Telelect, a leading US manufacturer of digger derricks,
telescopic aerials and cranes.
Wheeler, 46, who joined Telelect in 1969 and has been president since 1991,
has not been given a seat on the Simon board. Barker, a past president of
the International Powered Access Federation, will continue to be employed by
Simon in a consultative capacity.
Barker is almost the last of the old guard to lose his seat on the Simon
board following last summer's arrival of a new management team headed by
Maurice Dixson, a former GEC executive director. Only Peter Cook, 58, who
has been a director of Simon since 1977, remains on the board and he has
been relieved of his responsibilities as managing director of the industrial
services division, the biggest part of Simon's business.
Simon has dismantled its old divisional operating structure and the
executives in charge of the main operating companies now report direct to
the chief executive. Cook has been given responsibility for handling Simon's
disposal programme which is designed to reduce the group's heavy borrowings.
Dixson has also installed one of his old GEC colleagues, Guppy Dhariwal, 44,
as financial director of Simon Access which last year had a turnover of
Pounds 135m. Dhariwal, who is an engineer and an accountant, spent 17 years
with GEC and was financial director of its Satchwell division before joining
Simon; he takes over on the departure of Brian Horner.

FT  07 JAN 94 / Management: Radical change of art - The corporate benefits
of sculptures and paintings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RUPERT MORRIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The world of corporate art is changing. Two apparently unconnected
developments suggest that instead of remaining largely confined to
boardrooms and private houses, art may be penetrating more deeply into
British business.
First, there was one of the Confederation of British Industry's less
publicised initiatives - Art and Industry, which brought artists and
industrialists together one evening in October for the mutually beneficial
exchange of money for talent. The event is to be repeated annually.
Philip Herriott, one of the organisers and a director of Art Search, which
represents a large stable of artists, and puts business buyers in touch with
them, is still fielding enquiries from the evening. He is arranging for
business buyers to see artists in their studios.
Like an up-market wallpaper salesman, Herriott carries with him books of
photographs ranging from paintings under various headings - impressionist,
traditional, abstract, etc - to the sort of weird and wonderful sculptures
that might act as conversation pieces in a company's entrance hall or foyer.
It may not necessarily produce the greatest art, but the approach makes
sense to people like Hugh Stebbing, property director for Lloyds Bank, who
has come to appreciate the value of art as a motivational tool.
If Lloyds Bank employees at Hays Galleria, the trendy office and shop
development opposite the London Dungeon, have strong opinions about
anything, it is the paintings and sculptures that decorate their workspace.
In a recent questionnaire, this was the issue that eclipsed all others,
including food, lavatories and public transport.
Fortunately, most Lloyds employees like the art around them. But their
willingness to air their opinions delighted Stebbing. 'Art was a component
of the fit-out of the space,' he says of the Hays Galleria offices. 'You
only use space as a factor of production, and if artwork can provide a
happier environment for your staff, then it can enhance productivity.'
He talks enthusiastically about Faith Winter's huge sandstone sculpture of
the Lloyds horse in the bank's Bristol headquarters that fulfils the triple
purpose of hiding an electricity sub-station, proclaiming the company's
logo, and inspiring the workforce.
The second - and probably more significant - development in the growing
interdependence of art and business is the belated success of Broadgate, the
ambitious development of a 29-acre site around London's Liverpool Street
railway station. Here art, architecture and office life have become
virtually inseparable.
Passers-by are often amused and intrigued by Fernando Botero's voluptuous
giantess, the Broadgate Venus. Passing the waterfall nearby in Exchange
Square, some pause to admire the arch of Exchange House that echoes the
arches of the station beneath before moving on to puzzle at Xavier Corbero's
primitive Broadgate Family.
Initial revulsion at the rusting steel sheets of Richard Serra's huge
sculpture, the Fulcrum, outside the UBS building can eventually yield to at
least a grudging appreciation of the way it alters according to the light or
the weather, changing onlookers' perceptions without them noticing.
Stuart Lipton, the developer, talks of 'providing scale, humanity and the
genus loci that is the fundamental ingredient of successful urban design'.
Karen McCusker, a director of GRE Asset Management at 155 Bishopsgate, where
two massive Jim Dine sculptures of Venus dominate the foyer, says: 'I think
it makes a difference.'
For Harry Anderson, a partner in the solicitors' firm Herbert Smith, the
move to Broadgate was a chance to change the image of the firm - although
that wasn't the express intention.
When Anderson was entrusted with finding artworks to decorate the many blank
walls in the firm's smart new offices, he enlisted the help of art agency
Conservation Management. For two months he spent every spare moment
discussing how to fill the spaces, looking at the work of various artists,
and occasionally buying pieces at auction. The cost worked out at just over
Pounds 100 per employee - a tiny fraction of the total spent on the move.
Anderson bought nearly 200 items, ranging from limited edition prints to
original oil paintings, mixed media works and a few sculptures.
Fusty architectural prints and legal cartoons were no longer appropriate,
although some remain in the back-corridor offices at the request of their
occupants. Tall blank walls in the reception areas on each floor required
large, bright paintings, and are now dominated by impressionistic splashes
or, on one floor, a huge copper shield.
Many of the conference rooms have unusual, often abstract modern paintings,
while the dining rooms have more soothing still lives in bright, warm
colours.
'I was expecting a lot of complaints, but everyone has been surprisingly
complimentary,' comments Anderson. 'We were trying to produce an uplifting
environment. It sounds a bit pompous, but that's what we were trying to do.'
Harry Anderson's choices might not please absolutely everyone, but the
visitor moving around Herbert Smith's offices, distracted by these splashes
of colour and unusual images, pausing at the window to take in the rich
spectacle of Exchange Square, would not feel constrained by history and
tradition as in many law firms. Instead, occupants and visitors alike may
well feel inspired by the possibilities of the future.
This is only one example of art that is not just for the connoisseur. It is
for everyone, the workers included, and enlightened managers are
increasingly aware of its potential.

FT  07 JAN 94 / Property: Few rooms with views - Building and managing
hotels in Russia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The scaffolding that has surrounded the National hotel opposite Red Square
for the past two years speaks volumes about the hazards of Moscow's
international hotel business.
Endless rows over financing for the National have delayed its completion.
The dispute illustrates why any venture in Moscow is such a high-risk gamble
for western hoteliers. Yet the Russians' desire to attract western
management for new or refurbished hotels means there are potentially rich
rewards for companies that manage to surmount construction and ownership
disputes in a city where demand for quality hotel rooms vastly exceeds
supply.
The biggest headache for potential western investors is ambiguous ownership
rights. Russia's hotels, formerly owned by a single state monopoly under the
old communist order, are today the subject of competing ownership claims by
a variety of state and semi-state bodies.
Mr Richard Mason, general-manager of the newly-built Radisson-Slavyanskaya
hotel, one of the busiest in Moscow with 85 per cent-plus occupancy, says he
'does not even know who owns the Radisson-Slavyanskaya'.
The US Radisson group holds a contract to manage the hotel. It also holds
15.5 per cent of the equity in the joint venture which leases the hotel from
an owner whose identity has been the subject of dispute since the collapse
of the former Soviet Union's monopoly Intourist group.
The National, meanwhile, is the target of competing management claims from
at least three groups.
The Marriott hotel group of the US, which signed a management deal for the
National in May 1992, says its contract is still valid even though the
contract has been rejected by the Moscow city government.
Rogner, an Austrian construction company, has received assurances from some
Moscow city officials that it will be awarded the management contract for
the National as compensation for Russian payment delays for work on the
hotel's renovation.
Finally, according to some industry officials, a little-publicised tender
organised to side-step the Marriott-Rogner dispute has already been won by
Britain's Trust House Forte, even though the tender results have yet to be
endorsed by the city government.
The absence of clearly defined ownership rights means that financing for
hotel projects is very difficult to raise.
The Radisson-Slavyanskaya hotel, for example, is paying for the renovation
of 160 rooms out of profits after a Dollars 20m loan from Chase Manhattan
Bank fell through because the bank decided it would be difficult to seize
assets in the event of a loan default.
'Even if you get (ownership) rights on paper, they are not enforceable in
practice,' says a western banker with experience of trying to raise finance
for hotel projects in Russia. The continued presence of a railway workers'
welfare club on the grounds of the Radisson-Slavyanskaya hotel - in spite of
a 1992 order by the mayor of Moscow for its removal - illustrates the point.
Radisson is one of several international hotel chains being invited by the
Moscow authorities to manage the city's older hotels. But already some
western hoteliers have expressed doubts. 'What is required is a substantial
infusion of capital to complete these projects,' says Mr Mason of the
Radisson-Slavyanskaya hotel. 'The question is what does one get in return
for such an infusion.'
Western companies were also asked to renovate and run Hotel Tsentralnaya, a
crumbling building boasting a prime location and surly service. But
unresolved claims by the hotel's staff who say they are entitled to own the
hotel, together with uncertainty over funding for the reconstruction work,
have scared many potential western partners. These include Hilton
International, whose owner, Ladbroke, said: 'So far, we've never been able
to come up with a satisfactory deal. We continue to look. Hopefully we'll
come up with something.'
Even those hotels which are successful have battled against financial odds
which once threatened their viability. A Russian-Austrian consortium which
began rebuilding what is now called the Baltschug-Kempinski hotel was only
able to finish the work after attracting new partners and after the Austrian
export credit agency decided that the only way to recover initial Austrian
loans for the venture was to complete the project. Today, the plush
Baltschug-Kempinski hotel boasts occupancy levels in excess of 85 per cent.
In addition to having a reliable and well-connected Russian partner, Mr Hans
Sebesta, general manager of the Baltschug-Kempinski, says the secret of
success is for western companies to have their own people on the ground at
all times. 'You need someone who is permanently here, who pulls all the
strings together, who communicates with the shareholders. You cannot
delegate problems,' he says.
As the example of the National shows, a lack of transparent decision-making
in the transition to a market economy means western hoteliers will continue
to view Russia as a high-risk investment.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The investment performance of all sectors of the property market improved in
November, as property yields moved downwards, according to Investment
Property Databank, a research group. The all-property capital growth was 2.1
per cent for the month, the highest level since August 1988.
The all-property total return was 2.8 per cent for the month, compared with
1.7 per cent in October.
The aggregate equivalent yield was cut by a further 0.2 per cent to 9.3 per
cent. However, rental values continued to decline, at a rate of 0.6 per cent
in November, compared with 0.3 per cent in October.
The annualised rate of total return stood at 12.3 per cent for the year to
November. The annual capital growth rate turned positive for the first time
since mid-1990, reaching 2.5 per cent for the year to November.
Retail property was the best performing sector in November with a total
return of 3 per cent. The industrial sector fell into third place with a
return of 2.4 per cent in November, compared with 1.7 per cent in October.
The office sector continued to improve with a total return of 2.9 per cent
for the month.

FT  07 JAN 94 / Management: Production line treatment for patients - A
Swedish hospital is using manufacturing management techniques
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Think of a car going down a production line. Then picture a patient going
through a hospital. Can the two be compared? And can management techniques
to improve efficiency in the manufacturing sector be used with success in
services such as healthcare?
If Sweden's Karolinska hospital is anything to go by, the answer is yes. An
18-month time-based management project at the Stockholm hospital has cut
costs and waiting lists without affecting staff morale. The hospital is one
of the first healthcare organisations in the world where manufacturing
techniques have been applied so systematically.
The project has attracted international attention, particularly in Europe
where many hospitals are facing the same costs crunch as the Karolinska.
Among those to have shown an interest are representatives from 14 hospitals
in Denmark, two German hospitals, and UK hospitals in Wolverhampton and
Leeds.
'What we have done is to organise ourselves according to how the patient
moves through the system,' says Jan Lindsten, the hospital's chief
executive. 'The process is not quite the same as in the car industry but
there are great similarities.'
The Karolinska is facing a severe budgetary squeeze as part of a sweeping
reform of the country's healthcare system. It has been asked to cut costs by
SKr400m (Pounds 32.7m) between 1993 and 1995, equal to nearly 20 per cent of
its SKr2.2bn annual budget.
Lindsten says the hospital feared that a 'cheese-slicing' approach to its 45
departments would endanger their capacity to function effectively: 'The
challenge was to find a way to rationalise without cutting down by slicing.'
The resulting decision to call in the Boston Consulting Group led to the
adoption of a time-based management programme which takes the patient's
perspective. BCG manager Mikael Lovgren says the group has carried out more
than 60 other hospital projects worldwide, but that 'no other hospital has
made this kind of complete reorganisation around the patient flow'.
One of the first revelations was just how much patient and hospital time was
wasted by inefficient investigation procedures, which sometimes required the
patient to make up to five visits for different tests. Now nurse
co-ordinators arrange for all tests to be made during a single visit.
The second big area of inefficiency discovered was the operating theatre,
where an average of 59 minutes was being lost between the end of one
operation and the start of the next. The changes have cut the figure by more
than half.
The overhaul has placed far more stress on efficient preparation for
operations and bottlenecks have been reduced. Patients are pre-anaesthetised
outside the operating theatre so that less time is lost before the operation
begins. There is also less emphasis on having certain operating theatres
dedicated to particular types of operation while those of similar length and
complexity are carried out in the same theatre.
The changes have enabled the hospital to close four of its 16 theatres,
while increasing the number of operations. This year the hospital expects to
carry out 28,000 operations - 2,000 more than last year - in spite of the
reduced number of facilities.
The project has also led to more efficient use of operating nurses and
surgeons. But it also revealed that the hospital did not have enough
anaesthetists and that their time was used inefficiently. More anaesthetists
have been employed and an out-patient clinic for anaesthesiology has been
set up.
There has also been a significant re-organisation of the hospital's
functions. Separate medical and surgical departments and different tests
have been brought together to facilitate patient flow.
The project has not been applied to every department, partly because of
budgetary restraints. But in certain areas, it has achieved spectacular
results. Waiting times for hernia operations, for example, are down to three
weeks from as long as eight months. Overall cost savings have totalled more
than SKr100m, about 25 per cent of total costs in the areas affected.
The plan has met some resistance from staff who feared that increased
emphasis on time was simply a code for speeding things up and could lead to
mistakes. Lindsten emphatically denies there are any risks to the quality of
service, saying it is the time between operations rather than during them
that has been cut.
Some doctors and nurses have lost their jobs, he acknowledges, although more
anaesthetists have been recruited. 'Morale is better than it used to be,' he
stresses.

The Federation of Small Businesses says it plans to take legal advice over

companies.
The 58,000-member federation says the measure could force some companies
already suffering cashflow problems out of business.
The measures to be introduced in the Statutory Sick Pay bill, which has its
second reading debated in the House of Lords next Tuesday, will require
companies to fund all sick pay for the first four weeks of sickness. After
that companies with National Insurance bills of less than Pounds 20,000 will
have 100 per cent of sick pay refunded.

FT  07 JAN 94 / Capital spending 'cut 20%' by Tories
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour yesterday accused the government of cutting expenditure on local
authority capital projects by more than 20 per cent over the past decade,
creating maintenance problems for roads, school buildings and housing
estates, James Blitz writes.
Mr Doug Henderson, a shadow environment minister, said in a fresh assault on
the Conservatives' local government policies that the rise in capital
spending by local authorities in the past 10 years had been 21.8 per cent
below the rate of inflation.
Using parliamentary written answers, he also said that the worst victim of
the cuts had been housing, where spending had been cut by about 81 per cent
in real terms. 'This has created a capital deficit in our country which has
led to crumbling classrooms, leaking school roofs and dangerous roads,' he
said. 'The government seems blind to the effect of these policies.'
In spite of yesterday's attack, Labour's economic policies looked set to
come under fire from Mr Bryan Gould, the party's former campaign organiser
who stepped down from the shadow cabinet after the last election.
According to Tribune, the Labour weekly, Mr Gould will attack Labour's
economic policies in a manifesto to be published next month. In the
document, Mr Gould will accuse Mr John Smith, the party leader, of paying
'lip-service' to full employment.

FT  07 JAN 94 / Insurer fined Pounds 145,000 for three rule breaches
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fines totalling Pounds 145,000 have been imposed on the Life Association of
Scotland, the Edinburgh-based insurer, for three rule breaches relating to
recruitment and advertising.
Lautro, the self-regulating body for the life insurance industry, yesterday
said it had fined LAS Pounds 135,000 for two breaches of the rules intended
to ensure that only suitable individuals act as company representatives, and
a further Pounds 10,000 for a misleading 'pensions time-bomb' campaign in
November 1992. LAS admitted the charges.
The total is close to the record imposed by Lautro, which fined Interlink
Assurance Pounds 160,000 in April last year over its sales of pensions to
nurses.
LAS's fines will be paid by Internationale Nederlanden Groep, which sold LAS
to Britannia Life last autumn, after the breaches had taken place.
Mr Adrian Walsh, general executive assistant at Lautro, said the fine
reflected how seriously the regulator regarded LAS's breach of the general
principle that it should organise and control its internal affairs in a
responsible way.
Lautro found that in the period of just over two years from summer 1990, 35
individuals were LAS company representatives even though the company's
compliance officer was not satisfied that they were suitable. All 35 were
suspended by LAS, and about 30 then left the company. When Britannia Life
acquired LAS it terminated the contracts of all the direct sales force
because it has alternative ways of selling its products, particularly
through the building society with which it is linked.
Ms Elspeth McLean, head of corporate services at Britannia Life, said that
before the takeover LAS itself had taken steps to ensure that its
recruitment and advertising procedures met all Lautro requirements.
While Lautro did not object to the theme of the 'pensions time-bomb'
campaign, it said that the references in it to the Maxwell pensions scandal
were wrong and irrelevant.

FT  07 JAN 94 / Radio tags may home in on supermarkets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE and STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Scientists have developed an electronic system capable of identifying
individual items of travellers' luggage or scanning an entire basket of
supermarket items.
'Supertag' will be launched formally next week. It has been developed by the
South African Council for Scientific and Industrial Research in conjunction
with the British Technology Group, employing a technique used originally to
monitor livestock in transit.
BTG executives foresee a broad range of applications for the system but
accept that its early use in supermarkets is unlikely because of cost.
The technology, called radio tagging, is already widely used for security.
Ford, for example, builds radio tags made by Texas Instruments into the
locks of some of its latest cars. Texas Instruments is one of the world's
largest producers of radio tags.
The principle is simple. A silicon chip containing a unique number is
embedded in the product. A radio beam is directed at the chip. This powers
the chip, enabling it to respond by sending back its number. Transmitted,
say, to a an in-store computer, the information could be used to price a
basket of goods and provide information about inventory.
The problem to date has been reading more than one number simultaneously.
Supertag overcomes this using three scanners and a technique derived from
computer networking. Radio tags are expensive, however, costing from 60p to
Pounds 1.80. Mr Peter Hawkes of BTG said Supertag would not be feasible in
supermarkets until the price per tag fell to less than a penny.
Mr Douglas Etheridge of ICL, a leading manufacturer of retailing systems,
said there was intense interest in ways of making supermarket check-outs
more efficient. Radio scanning was a prime contender and he would be
examining the Supertag system carefully.
Texas Instruments said the system would be a huge advance if it was as fast
as the BTG said, but the company was sceptical about the claimed
performance.
Supermarket chains gave a lukewarm reception to the prospect of electronic
scanners being able to reduce queues and allow staff cuts.
Ms Sue Spencer of Tesco said: 'I have heard the report. We are always
interested in technological advances. I am sure our development people are
looking at the latest idea. But there are no immediate plans to introduce
scanners which read the contents of a trolley.'
Ms Spencer doubted that if a new scanning system were brought in tomorrow it
would mean significant reductions in staff. She said: 'Anyone saved from the
check-out could be deployed elsewhere.'
Ms Prue Raper for J. Sainsbury was also sceptical about potential staff
savings, saying: 'We are going back to more labour-intensive operations and
away from self-service.'

FT  07 JAN 94 / Insolvency firms predict sharp fall in failures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two leading firms of insolvency practitioners yesterday predicted that the
number of company failures would fall sharply this year.
Touche Ross, the accountancy firm, said the number of receivership and
administration appointments during 1994 would fall to as few as 2,000
compared with more than 3,200 during 1993 and 5,100 in 1992.
Separately, Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the UK's largest accountancy firm, forecast
that there would be 2,500 appointments during the year, with the total
number of failures including liquidations falling to 57,000 compared with
70,000 last year.
Mr Christopher Morris, senior insolvency partner with Touche, said the
projected decline reflected the benefits to business of economic recovery
without the normal risks of inflation.
Traditionally failures have continued to rise after the end of a recession
as companies 'overtraded' or expanded without the finance to support their
increasing activities.
Mr Morris said the decline in failures last year was the result of the end
of the recession, combined with more sympathetic handling of companies in
financial difficulties by bankers and accountants.
In January last year Coopers predicted that total failures for 1993 would be
about 70,000, which appears to be broadly accurate although final official
statistics have not yet been published.
Mr Steve Hill, a partner with the firm, said the difference between the
prediction and actual figure reflected tougher requirements under Scottish
insolvency law introduced last year.
The firms also commented on the government's consultation document on reform
of insolvency law as they prepared their responses for the Department of
Trade and Industry.
Mr Morris called for pressure to ensure there were changes in the law this
year or next in response to the document. 'We need sensible legislation so
that we have the tools to deal with the next crop of failures,' he said.
Many of the proposals in the 1986 act that had been designed to rescue and
rehabilitate companies had had little effect, including the introduction of
administration orders and company voluntary arrangements, he added. 'All too
often there have been annoying practical problems that have prevented their
full application.'
However, he welcomed the regulation of insolvency practitioners and the
individual voluntary arrangements allowing potential bankrupts to negotiate
with their creditors. A modest improvement in construction output is
expected this year, says a survey published today of 180 construction
companies, building material producers, building professionals and private
and public-sector customers.
The survey, conducted by New Builder magazine and Bristol contractor JT
Design Build, said there was still substantial over-capacity in the industry
but the situation was no longer worsening. Customers were prepared to invest
more in building.
The survey also showed that 60 per cent of construction companies, building
material producers and consultants were operating in continental Europe, a
higher proportion than previously thought.

FT  07 JAN 94 / Costly hospital buildings braced for fatal prescription:
Alan Pike considers the difficult decisions to be taken on health provision
in London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The future of many million pounds worth of new hospital buildings is in
doubt as the government approaches final decisions on the shape of
healthcare in London.
Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, announced last month the first
decisions arising from the Tomlinson report into London hospital services.
Further decisions, including some of the most controversial, are expected
this month.
Substantial building work has taken place at a number of the threatened
hospitals recently, and their managers are using this as an argument against
closure.
Among the recommendations being considered by Mrs Bottomley is a proposal
from the Guy's and St Thomas' trust that it continue to use the south Thames
sites of both hospitals. The trust board was asked by the government to
consider concentrating services on a single site, but has recommended that
the best buildings on each site be retained.
If the government were to reject this recommendation, the transfer of all
services to St Thomas' - where the accident and emergency department will be
located - would mean abandoning Philip Harris House, a Pounds 140m highly
advanced specialist care centre nearing completion at Guy's.
In west central London an excess of hospital capacity has made a merger
between the Hammersmith and Charing Cross hospitals a strong possibility.
Closing Hammersmith, the likely option, would mean the loss of buildings on
which Pounds 70m has been spent in the past seven years. These include a
Pounds 14m clinical research institute funded by the Medical Research
Council which is about to open. But closure of Charing Cross, which dates
only from the 1970s, would be still more embarrassing for the government.
Closure of new buildings will generate political criticism, but could prove
cost-effective. Staff costs account for up to 80 per cent of National Health
Service expenditure, and savings from hospital closures could exceed the
cost of writing off recent building projects within a few years.
Last February the government accepted the broad recommendation of the
Tomlinson report that health provision in London should shift from hospital
to primary and community services. Since then the London Implementation
Group - a specialist team chaired by Sir Tim Chessells, former chairman of
North East Thames regional health authority - has developed detailed
proposals and tried to broker ideas for change between hospitals.
One of the difficulties it has faced, however, is that the public - and some
NHS staff - still regard healthcare in terms of particular beloved
institutions rather than services.
Mrs Bottomley has decided to close the accident and emergency department at
St Bartholomew's hospital in the City, but intends to retain University
College hospital in Euston.
University College's local health authority had wanted to transfer patients
to alternative, cheaper hospitals. But Mrs Bottomley decided that the
requirements of the prestigious University College medical school and the
need for an accident and emergency department in north central London
justified the hospital's retention. However, neither University College nor
its sister Middlesex hospital has the quality of buildings required for a
long-term future. North East Thames regional health authority has
recommended to Mrs Bottomley that University College and the nearby Great
Ormond Street children's hospital should work towards 'being on a single
site providing a range of local and specialist services'.
This could lead to University College being relocated at Great Ormond
Street. Much of the children's hospital's recent redevelopment was financed
by Pounds 54m raised from the public in the Wishing Well, one of the most
successful one-off charitable appeals ever mounted in Britain. It would take
a brave minister to decide to abandon that particular building.

FT  07 JAN 94 / Whitehall 'spends up to Pounds 900m on advice'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Consultancy work used by government departments could be worth up to Pounds
900m a year, according to Whitehall officials.
The significant growth in the use of outside consultants by ministers has
prompted a wide-ranging scrutiny of the government's use of external
consultants.
Ministers believe departments spend anywhere between Pounds 100m and Pounds
900m a year on consultancy work.
Sir Peter Levene, the prime minister's adviser on efficiency, who yesterday
announced the review, said: 'We need to define precisely what we mean about
consultancies so that the same criteria are used by each department.'
The Cabinet Office's efficiency unit will then be able to estimate for the
first time what the government is spending on management consultants,
merchant banks and accountants.
The unit has established a team of civil servants from five departments to
work on a report which it plans to publish by the middle of the year.
Whitehall officials said the government would be looking at why departments
often take on expensive consultancies staffed by former civil servants.
'Those same civil servants cost the government a fraction of what they
charge when they move into the private sector,' said one official.
The review will be examining processes for hiring and managing of
consultants.

FT  07 JAN 94 / New cuts to Department of Health
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The prospect of staff reductions in the Department of Health was raised
yesterday by a review set up by Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health
secretary.
Mrs Bottomley has already announced proposals to abolish regional health
authorities and streamline the Leeds-based National Health Service
management executive.
The new review will cover the Department of Health itself, and is likely to
put the future of some senior posts at risk.
Mrs Terri Banks, who was registrar-general until 1990 and is a former
director of health authority finance on the NHS management executive, will
conduct the inquiry, which is due to report by May.
She has been asked to take account of 'the importance of reducing running
costs as far as possible while maintaining an effective service to
ministers'.

FT  07 JAN 94 / Big increase in DTI probes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The number of company investigations begun by the Department of Trade and
Industry nearly doubled - to 79 - in the third quarter of 1993 compared with
the quarter before, official figures released yesterday show.
Requests for investigations rose to 255 during the quarter, reaching a total
of 1,107 for the year to September 30 compared with 876 in the previous 12
months.
The proportion of requests for investigations that were rejected was almost
unchanged at 78 per cent compared with 79 per cent last year.
Two-thirds of the requests came from members of the public, 21 per cent from
other divisions of within the DTI, 9 per cent from other regulators and only
3 per cent from the police or the director of public prosecutions.
In the third quarter, 53 investigations were completed compared with 45 in
the second quarter of the year.
Seven defendants were convicted in criminal proceedings and three of them
received custodial sentences.
The convictions were for offences including fraudulent trading, theft,
forgery and conducting unauthorised investment business.
There were 18 winding-up orders granted by the courts during investigations
carried out by DTI officials.
In addition, there were 44 criminal convictions in response to reports from
official receivers on the affairs of insolvent companies and debtors.
During the year the department was involved in six cases of providing
assistance to overseas regulators in the pursuit of cross-border fraud.
The number of confidential investigations begun by the department was 228 in
the year to September 30 compared with 164 in the previous 12 months. The
number completed was 197 compared with 167.

FT  07 JAN 94 / Aspirin 'may save 100,000 lives'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The humble aspirin could prevent 100,000 premature deaths a year around the
world, says research published today in the British Medical Journal.
The cost of each death avoided would be 'about Pounds 250', and if all those
at risk took aspirin the National Health Service alone would save at least
Pounds 70m a year, the research authors say.
The study is the largest in a series that suggests one of the world's
cheapest drugs can be effective against two of the world's biggest killers:
heart attacks and strokes.
Regular small doses of aspirin could prevent 100,000 deaths a year of people
aged less than 70 and avoid twice as many non-fatal heart attacks and
strokes, says the report. The document is a compilation of results of 300
different trials involving 140,000 patients.
Such reports have already boosted global sales of aspirin. In the US 10 per
cent to 20 per cent of all aspirin sales are for patients with
cardiovascular problems, according to industry estimates.
In the UK the figure is 'under 10 per cent, but sales are growing by 17 per
cent a year', said UK manufacturer Reckitt and Colman. Reckitt said that the
BMJ report should increase sales further.
Although aspirin lost its patents decades ago, global sales are still worth
Pounds 600m a year. The biggest supplier is French company Rhone-Poulenc,
which makes more than a quarter of world output of 40,000 tonnes.
Its low cost may have inhibited its wider use, according to Professor
Richard Peto of Oxford University and one of the authors of the BMJ report.
He said: 'Aspirin is so familiar that many doctors and patients still don't
fully recognise its importance. Perhaps if aspirin were 100 times as
expensive it would be used more widely.'
'The cost of half an aspirin each day is low, so that even at UK aspirin
prices, each death avoided costs only about Pounds 250 and there are further
benefits from preventing non-fatal heart attacks and strokes.'
Today's report says aspirin is effective for women as well as men. For more
than a decade US guidelines on aspirin after stroke recommended it only for
men. It also says aspirin is effective in a wide range of conditions other
than heart attack and stroke.
The research says the best dose is about half a tablet a day but warns that
people with low risk of heart or blood vessel disease should not take
aspirin regularly. The chances of internal bleeding as a result of taking
aspirin regularly are low, but may be higher than that of cardiovascular
disease in healthy people.

FT  07 JAN 94 / Financial advisers 'will not be penalised' over insurance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Independent financial advisers who have tried and failed to find
professional indemnity insurance will not be penalised, their regulator said
yesterday.
The indication came from Mr Godfrey Jillings, chief executive of Fimbra  -
which regulates IFAs. It also emerged that many cannot help being in breach
of rules requiring them to have the cover because of insurers' concern about
possible compensation payments arising from pensions transfer business.
The insurance rule was introduced by Fimbra in mid-1991. The difficulties
follow a report on pensions transfers, commissioned by the Securities and
Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog, and published last month. It
suggested that sales agents and advisers had not complied with regulators'
requirements in up to nine-tenths of the sale of about 500,000 pensions to
people transferring out of occupational pension schemes.
Mr Jillings yesterday met Mr Victor Knope of Bradstock Blunt &amp; Thompson to
discuss concerns about the issue. The company acts as Fimbra's managing
broker for professional indemnity insurance. After the meeting, Fimbra said
that there were 'conflicting views in the marketplace' about the effect of
anxieties over pension transfers, and that it hoped the problem would be
resolved within the next few weeks.
In the meantime, IFAs which have found difficulty in renewing their
professional indemnity insurance will be allowed to trade without cover.
If an individual IFA is unable to meet claims upon it and goes into default,
the industry-financed Investors Compensation Scheme will act as a backstop.

FT  07 JAN 94 / Hebrides quarry inquiry ordered
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, yesterday ordered a public inquiry into a
plan by the construction group Redland to open a large coastal quarry on the
island of Harris in the Outer Hebrides.
The move will please environmental organisations which have been campaigning
against the project.
Western Isles council decided last June by 24 votes to three to give Redland
Aggregates, Redland's construction materials subsidiary, permission to open
the quarry. The Pounds 50m project would involve extracting 600m tonnes of
anorthosite, a white rock used in road building, from the headland of
Lingerabay in South Harris.
The quarrying, lasting about 60 years, would cover a square mile. Lingerabay
would disappear and a new sea loch would be created. The rock would be taken
away by sea.
Mr Lang said the proposal raised important national issues. The inquiry will
cover only the Lingerabay project, but is likely to be seen as a pointer to
decisions on other projects for coastal quarries in the Highlands.
Supporters of the project argue that it would create employment and benefit
the economy of South Harris, whose population is in decline.
Environmental organisations argue that it would destroy unspoilt landscape
and cause sea pollution. A leading objector was Scottish Natural Heritage,
the government's environmental agency.

FT  07 JAN 94 / Unions in Swan Hunter refit bid
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Union officials fighting for the survival of Swan Hunter, the Tyneside
shipbuilder in receivership, yesterday launched a campaign to persuade the
Ministry of Defence to advance a big refit by three months and place the
contract with the yard.
They began distributing postcards - to be sent to the prime minister - among
Swan Hunter's remaining 1,088 employees, to strengthen a call for the MoD to
award Swan Hunter the refit of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary supply vessel Sir
Bedivere.

FT  07 JAN 94 / Customs to act over statistical returns
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is to clamp down on companies trading within the single
European market that are failing to comply with requirements to file monthly
statistical returns.
Customs and Excise said yesterday it was planning 'firm action' against
companies still refusing to meet their obligations, a year after the systems
were introduced.
Customs can impose fines through local magistrates' courts of up to Pounds
2,500 on companies which do not file monthly Intrastat returns.
The figures provide information for compiling the trade statistics across
the European Union following the abolition of border controls.

FT  07 JAN 94 / NUT rebuffs Dearing call to end test boycott
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The prospect of another summer of industrial unrest in schools increased
sharply yesterday as Britain's largest teachers' union called for this
year's national curriculum tests to be abandoned.
Mr John Patten, the education secretary, is unlikely to accept the request,
made by Mr Doug McAvoy, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers.
Sir Ron Dearing, who published a radical review of the curriculum earlier
this week, urged unions to administer the tests this year.
He said: 'I think the tests are a valuable part of the education system and
I urge teachers to carry them out this year.'
But Mr McAvoy, whose union last month voted by a 20-to-1 majority in favour
of continuing the boycott on the tests, said: 'Sir Ron's final report
recognises that there is still a need to slim down and simplify the
curriculum and its associated assessment and testing arrangements. Until
this is done an unnecessary workload remains.'
He said that Sir Ron's review of the content of each subject - which will
start next week - might recommend further cuts, but the whole of the present
curriculum is to be tested this year.
He said: 'If they change the curriculum for next year then the tests will
not be comparable and the whole exercise will be pointless.'
The NUT has asked the Electoral Reform Society to consult its members on the
action it should take over this year's tests if Mr Patten does not abandon
them. The results are expected early next month.
Ms Margaret Morrissey, an official of the National Confederation of Parent
Teacher Associations, told Sir Ron that he had 'won the battle with parents,
but not the war'.
She predicted that parents would support a continued boycott provided unions
left a decision on the tests to individual schools rather than taking
national action.
Mr Peter Smith, general secretary of the Association of Teachers and
Lecturers, has called for the boycott to be abandoned, saying that a
continued refusal to administer the tests could not be justified to parents.
However, he has not yet ballotted members, and his union's boycott remains
in place at least until they have voted.
The executive of the other big teachers' union, the National Association of
Schoolmasters/Union of Women Teachers, will decide on its attitude to the
boycott over the weekend.

FT  07 JAN 94 / Ladbroke and MAI to launch joint lottery bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ladbroke, the leisure and hotel group, is joining forces with Lord Hollick's
MAI, the television and financial services company, to bid for the National
Lottery licence. An announcement is expected next week.
The new 50-50 consortium, which will be independent of both parent
companies, joins a growing list of significant groups vying to run the
lottery that within a few years could grow to a turnover of between Pounds
3bn and Pounds 4bn.
The declared bidders include Camelot, a consortium backed by Cadbury
Schweppes; The Great British Lottery Company, whose shareholders include
Granada, Carlton and Associated Newspapers; and Mr Richard Branson's UK
Lottery Foundation, which plans to hand over all its profits to a charitable
foundation.
Neither Ladbroke nor MAI would comment last night.
Ladbroke's interests include Vernons football pools and a chain of betting
offices. Apart from financial services and market research, MAI is the
controlling shareholder in Meridian Broadcasting, the ITV company for the
south of England.
It is believed the two companies intend to buy-in the specialist services
they need.
Mr Peter Davis, director-general of the National Lottery, has called for
expressions of interest in applying for the lottery licence by January 14,
with the applications deadline set for February 14.
The National Lottery could be launched late this year although early next
year now seems more likely.
IMS, the interactive telephone company, yesterday appealed for telephone
selling of lottery tickets and promoting of lottery games played by
telephone to be part of the lottery from the outset.
IMS estimates telephone transactions could account for 5 per cent of lottery
turnover.
Customs and Excise yesterday rejected a proposal from the UK Lottery
Foundation that the National Lottery should be zero-rated for value added
tax.

FT  07 JAN 94 / PM dismisses Yeo blow to family values
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major, the prime minister, insisted yesterday that the government's
campaign for a return to traditional family values would continue, in spite
of Mr Tim Yeo's resignation over his fathering of an illegitimate child in
an extra-marital affair.
Other leading Tories rushed to deny charges of government hypocrisy as
members of Mr Yeo's Suffolk South constituency began moves to force the
former environment minister to quit the Commons.
Mr Major said: 'Back to basics isn't a crusade about personal morality and
it was never presented as such.
'It has been about policy issues of concern to everyone in the country -
issues like fighting crime and making punishment more effective.'
'What in essence we are seeking to do is to push to one side many of these
fashionable theories that have taken root over recent years that we believe
are a denial of commonsense. We can do without these fashionable theories.'
He added: 'I think . . . what underpins most human behaviour are the basic
instincts of commonsense.'
Mr Major's view was supported by a raft of senior Conservatives, including
Mr David Hunt, employment secretary, Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health
secretary, and Sir Marcus Fox, the influential chairman of the backbench
1922 committee.
There were signs, however, that ministers may have underestimated the
appetite of grassroots party members for fundamental moral values.
Mrs Aldine Horrigan, vice-chairman of the Suffolk South constituency
association's Haverhill branch and a key member of the group which forced Mr
Yeo's resignation, said he should also quit as an MP.
The branch said that it would not support Mr Yeo in any future re-selection.
The growing inclination of local activists to flex their political muscles
was dismissed as 'a one-off' by senior ministers. However, it was seen as a
worrying development by backbenchers. 'I think that is a very unsettling
precedent,' said one senior back bencher.
It also emerged yesterday that Mr Yeo's attempts to avoid resignation were
given strong private support by senior ministers, including Mr Major, Mr
Richard Ryder, the chief whip, and Mr John Gummer, environment secretary.
Party officials said public support for Mr Yeo from Sir Norman Fowler, party
chairman, and Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, 'reflected government
policy'. This contrasts with earlier suggestions that Downing Street had
remained aloof from the affair.

FT  07 JAN 94 / Sports Council rejects criticisms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Officials at the Sports Council, the government body set up to develop
sporting activity, yesterday defended themselves against allegations of
extravagance and poor administration amid signs that these criticisms will
be highlighted next week.
The National Audit Office, the government's accounting watchdog, is to issue
a report examining whether the council has provided value for money in
recent years. The details of the report remain secret, but members of the
Commons public accounts committee and the NAO are concerned that the council
has been lax in its administration of some assets.
MPs have raised concern that nearly a third of the council's overall income
last year was spent on administrative costs and staff salaries.
At the heart of the watchdog's concern is the council's policy of farming
out the management of assets, including some sports centres, to a charitable
trust called the Sports Council Trust Company.
Last month the NAO pointed out that, if the trust company sold any of these
assets, the council might not be able to ensure that it received the
proceeds from the trust in order to pass them back to the exchequer.
The council said the administration costs reflected the activity of an
organisation which supports local authorities and voluntary bodies
throughout the country.

FT  07 JAN 94 / Hoover's air offer hits more trouble
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Hoover free-flight promotion has run into further trouble with more than
500 people complaining to trading standards officers about a deadline set by
the company for accepting travel dates, Roland Adburgham writes.
Letters dated December 23 gave Hoover customers entitled to flights until
last Wednesday to accept one of three departure dates in the early part of
this year. But in some cases the letters were not received until the day of
the deadline.
Trading standards officers in Mid Glamorgan, where Hoover has its UK plant,
said five telephone lines had been jammed for two days with complaints from
all over the country.
Mr Steve Delahaye, the officer handling the complaints, said people were
protesting at the lack of time to accept the offer and make holiday
arrangements: 'It is very unfortunate that Hoover has given such short
notice,' he said.
Hoover said yesterday that letters had been sent out over a six-week period
but one batch had been held up and had not given people enough time to
respond. 'The company is very concerned and aware of the problems and people
are being given an extra two days,' it said.
The company launched the promotion in 1992 offering two free flights for
customers spending more than Pounds 100. It was inundated by the response.

FT  07 JAN 94 / Dearing denies reports on vocational courses
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Ron Dearing yesterday firmly denied reports that the vocational courses
he has recommended for 14-year-olds would include plumbing and bricklaying.
Addressing the North of England Education Conference in Chester, he said:
'My thinking is essentially down the route of general vocational
qualifications where there is a mixture of the applied and the conceptual -
broad subjects such as art and design or leisure and tourism. Not plumbing.
That's not what I had in mind at all.'
He suggested that pupils learning an applied subject such as tourism and
leisure would need to master aspects of geography, foreign languages and
communication skills. He denied the measure would introduce academic
selection at the age of 14 and said good vocational courses could 'switch
some pupils on' and develop their academic education.
He added that schools would not in any case have the resources to teach
subjects as practical as bricklaying, but encouraged them to form links with
further education colleges to ensure that the vocational work for
14-year-olds would be of a high standard.

FT  07 JAN 94 / Vote threatens union merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A merger designed to create one of the most powerful management unions in
Britain was jeopardised yesterday when delegates from one of the unions
voted to unravel the deal.
The merger of the Engineers' and Managers' Association, the 30,000-strong
electricity industry-based union, with the 5,000-strong British Association
of Colliery Management, was due to be concluded next Monday.
Yet in spite of an overwhelming vote - 4,017 to 211 - in favour of the
merger by Bacom members in September, a delegate conference of 60 members in
Nottingham yesterday backed a motion rejecting it.
The motion, moved by Mr Doug Bulmer, Bacom president, maintains that
assurances about Bacom independence within the merged union cannot be relied
upon. Neither Mr John Meads, leader of Bacom, nor Mr Tony Cooper, leader of
the EMA, was available for comment yesterday.
But senior union officials said a personality clash between Mr Bulmer and Mr
Cooper lay behind the move to unravel the deal.
It is unclear whether yesterday's decision can override a vote by the whole
Bacom membership. If, as still seems likely, the formal merger does go ahead
next week, legal action is likely to commence.
This latest union merger problem comes soon after the emergence of
infighting between the engineering workers and electricians in the AEEU
craft union merger.
Ironically the EMA, with other management unions such as the IPMS civil
service union and the STE telecommunications union, has pioneered a looser
form of amalgamation, designed to allow unions to share services and save
money without losing their identities.

FT  07 JAN 94 / Sports Council rejects criticisms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Officials at the Sports Council, the government body set up to develop
sporting activity, yesterday defended themselves against allegations of
extravagance and poor administration amid signs that these criticisms will
be highlighted by a Whitehall body next week.
The National Audit Office, the government's accounting watchdog, will issue
a report next week examining whether the council has provided value for
money in recent years.
The details of the report remain secret, but members of the Commons public
accounts select committee and the NAO are concerned that the council has
been lax in its administration of some assets.
MPs have raised concern that nearly a third of the council's overall income
last year was spent on administrative costs and staff salaries, even though
it has only 450 staff.
At the heart of the watchdog's concern is the council's policy of farming
out the management of assets - including several sports centres - to a
charitable trust, called the Sports Council Trust Company.
Last month an NAO statement pointed out that, if the trust company sold any
of these assets, the council might not be able to ensure that it received
the proceeds from the trust in order to pass them back to the exchequer. It
urged the government to take remedial action.
Mr Alan Williams, a Labour member of the public accounts committee, is also
concerned by details of the organisation's accounts. The 1993 accounts show
the council and its subsidiaries spent Pounds 16.4m on administration and
staff costs against an annual Whitehall grant of Pounds 47.6m. Mr Williams
said that figure seemed 'very high'.
The council said that the administration costs reflected the activity of an
organisation which supports local authorities and voluntary bodies
throughout the country. The council added that it had included a special
clause in its contracts with the trust company to ensure that it could claw
back funds.

FT  07 JAN 94 / Sluggishness in European mainland markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Continued sluggishness in European mainland markets has caused
'disappointing' export business, members of the Confederation of British
Industry in Yorkshire and Humberside said yesterday, Ian Hamilton Fazey
writes.
The CBI's regional council added that economic recovery was under way, but
slowly, with only gradual improvement in home orders to compensate for
export difficulties. Asia-Pacific markets were also reported to be less
buoyant than a few months ago.
Mr Peter Lee, the chairman, said: 'The construction industry is still short
of work and margins in this, as well as many other sectors, are under severe
pressure.
'Many manufacturers are still finding life difficult. More companies are
reducing workforce numbers than increasing them.'

FT  07 JAN 94 / Top Tories on defensive in wake of Yeo affair
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Leading Conservatives rushed to defend the government against charges of
hypocrisy yesterday as party members in Suffolk began moves to force Mr Tim
Yeo, the former environment minister, to quit the Commons.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, said the government's campaign for a
return to traditional family values would continue, in spite of Mr Yeo's
resignation over an extra-marital affair that produced an illegitimate
child.
Mr Major, speaking outside Number 10 Downing Street, said: 'Back to basics
isn't a crusade about personal morality and it was never presented as such.
'It has been about policy issues of concern to everyone in the country -
issues like fighting crime and making punishment more effective.'
Mr Major's view was supported by a raft of senior Conservatives, including
Mr David Hunt, employment secretary, Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health
secretary, and Sir Marcus Fox, the influential chairman of the backbench
1922 committee.
There were signs, however, that ministers may have underestimated the
appetite of grassroots party members for fundamental moral values.
Mrs Aldine Horrigan, vice-chairman of the South Suffolk constituency
association's Haverhill branch and a key member of the group which forced Mr
Yeo's resignation, said Mr Yeo should also quit as an MP.
The branch said in a message to the association's executive committee that
it would not support Mr Yeo in any future re-selection.
The growing inclination of local activists to flex their political muscles
was dismissed as 'a one-off' by senior ministers. However, it was seen as a
worrying development by backbenchers. 'The prime minister has allowed the
constituency association to make the decision for him. I think that is a
very unsettling precedent,' said a senior backbencher.
It also emerged yesterday that Mr Yeo's attempts to avoid resignation were
given strong private support by senior ministers, including Mr Major, Mr
Richard Ryder, the chief whip, and Mr John Gummer, environment secretary.
Senior party officials said public support given to Mr Yeo by Sir Norman
Fowler, the party chairman, and Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary,
'reflected government policy'. The disclosure contrasts with earlier
suggestions from officials that Downing Street had remained aloof from the
affair.

FT  07 JAN 94 / World Trade News: Administration unveils proposals to help
domestic air industries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Clinton administration yesterday unveiled a package of legislative
proposals, including one to increase foreign ownership of US airlines, which
are designed to reinvigorate the ailing US airline and aircraft industries.
The initiatives, announced by Mr Federico Pena, transportation secretary,
and Dr Laura D'Andrea Tyson, head of the Council of Economic Advisers, grew
out of recommendations prepared by a presidential commission last summer.
The proposals will provoke much controversy in Congress. However, the White
House is presenting them with much fanfare as 'the most comprehensive
government aviation strategy since deregulation of the industry in 1978.'
President Bill Clinton has moved swiftly on the problems of the US airline
and aircraft industries, which have lost more than Dollars 10bn (Pounds
6.7bn) since 1990. The commission he appointed in April was given 90 days to
make recommendations. It found, among other things, that the US air
transportation system was being 'hobbled by self-imposed and
government-mandated attitudes and policies that are dysfunctional.'
It said the system must be made 'efficient and technologically superior,'
and that the FAA must be 'reinvented.' Furthermore, it must have the
financial strength to respond to rapid change.
Mr Pena said the new proposals will encourage carriers into the market,
heighten scrutiny of airline financial fitness and promote employee
ownership. They propose a change in US law to let officials negotiate
bilateral agreements by which foreign investors could hold up to 49 per cent
equity in US airlines.
Foreign investors can now own 49 per cent of a US carrier's stock but only
25 per cent of its voting stock.
The commission advanced two conditions for increasing the share of foreign
companies: bilateral agreements would have to contain equivalent
opportunities for US investors and the change would have to advance the US
national interest and the development of a liberal global regime for air
services.
The US administration has rejected one commission recommendation - a
reduction of air ticket taxes from 8 to 5 percent - on the grounds that the
airline industry is recovering with the rest of the economy and no longer
needs such help.
Other steps advocated in the initiative include:
a thorough review of all aviation regulations to lessen industry burdens
wherever possible;
a requirement that airlines seeking approval for international routes and
other big changes outline plans to protect any displaced workers;
accelerated use of satellite-based navigation and completion of an
aeronautical research and development plan to support technological
advances;
evaluation of modifications to the high-density rule, which limits flights
at busy airports, to use airport capacity better.

FT  07 JAN 94 / World Trade News: Airbus sees 13.7% rise in turnover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Airbus Industrie, the European aircraft manufacturing consortium, yesterday
reported a 13.7 per cent rise in turnover to Dollars 8.3bn last year from
Dollars 7.3bn in 1992 despite a fall in deliveries and an even steeper drop
in new orders.
Although deliveries fell from 154 aircraft in 1992 to 138 aircraft last
year, the increased turnover reflected a shift in the pattern of deliveries
with a bigger proportion of higher value widebody aircraft following the
entry into airline service of the new Airbus A340 and A330 widebody
airliners.
Airbus suffered 69 cancellations last year while new orders fell sharply to
38 aircraft from 136 in 1992, the group said.
The figures did not include orders for six A340s from Cathay Pacific and a
further six A340s from Air Canada.
Airbus also announced yesterday its first orders for 1994 with Air Inter,
the domestic French carrier owned by Air France, ordering nine A319
narrowbody airliners worth around Dollars 340m and taking options on an
additional nine.
The consortium, whose partners include Aerospatiale of France, Deutsche
Aerospace, British Aerospace and Casa of Spain, described 1993 as 'one of
the most difficult years on record' but said there were now signs of
stabilisation in the air transport market.
Airbus is also expected to have made an operating profit last year after
making an operating surplus of around Dollars 250m in 1992.
However, it said its policy of rigorous order book management had enabled it
to make less brutal production adjustments compared with its main US
competitor, Boeing.
The consortium's revised production schedule will see deliveries fall to 134
aircraft this year, pick up to 138 in 1995 (the same as last year), and then
rise to 154 in 1996, returning to the same level as in 1992.
Boeing, for its part, has cut its production rate by around 30 per cent from
32.5 aircraft a month at the beginning of last year to 23 aircraft last
month. Boeing's monthly output will drop to 21 aircraft next month and then
to 19.5 aircraft in November and to 18.5 aircraft in January 1995.
But the US manufacturer had a considerably stronger new aircraft order
intake last year than Airbus, reflecting in part the launch of its new 737X
narrowbody airliner and the new 767 freighter aircraft as well as the order
build-up for its new 777 wide-body twin-engine airliner.
Overall, Boeing won new orders for 246 aircraft worth Dollars 16.59bn last
year compared with new orders for 243 aircraft worth Dollars 17.77bn in
1992.
Airbus said it would continue to monitor closely the evolution of the
market, making further changes to its production plans when necessary. It
also expected to see a recovery in the market in the second half of the
decade.
With a large order backlog of 667 aircraft worth Dollars 55.4bn at the end
of last year, Airbus said it had four years of production in hand. By
comparison, Boeing had an order backlog of more than 1,150 aircraft at the
end of last year.
Airbus said it believed it was strongly placed to take advantage of the
recovery with its expanded and comprehensive family of aircraft. Its target
was to capture well over 30 per cent of the world airliner market in the
second half of the decade.

FT  07 JAN 94 / World Trade News: Teething troubles nag at Mercosur market /
Assessing the chances of a four-nation South American trade venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM and ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Negotiators from Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay, the four countries
that make up the South American common market Mercosur, are holding a series
of meetings over the next 10 days to try to restart their integration
programme.
The meetings of foreign and finance ministers and officials will end in
mid-January with a presidential summit in Uruguay. The encounters are an
attempt to relax growing tension between Argentina and Brazil over trade and
to seek a compromise over a common tariff structure.
Tariffs between the four are being gradually cut until they reach zero for
most products by December next. Goods will then circulate freely while
imports from outside Mercosur will be subject to common tariffs. Mercosur's
integration timetable says the external tariffs were to have been
established at the end of December.
But, in meetings last month, Argentina and Brazil failed to compromise on
the level of tariffs to be applied, and on which 'sensitive' products should
be allowed higher tariffs as protection from foreign competition. The two
countries are home to the region's biggest economies and their dispute
threatens Mercosur's future.
The disagreement boils down to a divergence over industrial policy. Brazil
wants higher external tariffs to protect such sectors as its high-technology
and capital goods industries. Argentina, which is less industrialised,
insists on low tariffs. Little Paraguay and Uruguay have been virtually shut
out of the debate.
Meanwhile, Argentina is retaliating against what it claims are 'unfair'
Brazilian exports. Mr Domingo Cavallo, Argentina's economy minister,
complains that Brazilian companies are dumping goods in Argentina. This
week, he introduced protectionist measures against Brazilian chemicals. Like
many other Brazilian products, these are increasingly competitive in
Argentina because of falling tariffs. The Argentine minister has already
imposed similar measures against steel, refrigerators, paper, agricultural
machinery and textiles.
Brazil, which is increasingly irritated by Mr Cavallo's statements, says its
exports are competitive because of Argentina's overvalued exchange rate.
Other problems divide the two. Brazil is struggling to stabilise its
economy, while Argentina has achieved low inflation and high growth.
Brazil's political scene is confused, while Argentine President Carlos Menem
is consolidating his power.
Meanwhile, he does not hide his interest in joining the North American Free
Trade Agreement. US President Bill Clinton has mentioned Chile and Argentina
as the next potential candidates for membership. But a US official said: 'We
do not want Brazil in its present situation.'
However, officals from both sides still stress that their relationship
remains a cornerstone of foreign policy. Mercosur is intended as a framework
for political co-operation between two countries which, until recently, were
viewing each other as adversaries.
In a similar vein, Mr Menem has called on Chile, a country on which
Argentina almost declared war in 1977, to join Mercosur. However, Chilean
President-elect Eduardo Frei has signalled that he has no intention of doing
so. He is probably intent on waiting for an invitation to join Nafta.
Brazil's deepening problems and trade disputes with Argentina are leading
both partners to question whether earlier hopes of full economic integration
can be achieved under the original timetable. They may be forced to settle
for a more realistic, less ambitious, customs union in which free trade
would only initially apply to certain sectors of products.
The four have agreed on common tariffs of 0-20 per cent for nearly all the
goods they import. But they cannot agree on tariffs for capital goods,
telecommunications equipment and computers. Brazil insisted originally on a
20-35 per cent tariff for these goods until 2001; Argentina demanded zero
tariffs.
Argentina wants low tariffs to encourage industry to modernise. Mr Jorge
Herrera Vegas, Argentina's under-secretary for economic integration, said
capital 'goods should be bought as cheaply as possible in the international
market. Argentina is preparing for a leap in exports. It needs the most
technologically advanced goods.'
But Brazil protests that it cannot compete against American, Japanese and
European goods imported duty-free by Argentina. The Brazilians also demand
preference for their goods in Argentina because the latter is using
privileged access to Brazil's much bigger market to provide its industry
with the economies of scale needed to raise international competitiveness
and become attractive to foreign investors.
Hope is dwindling that the upcoming meetings will lead to compromise. A
Brazilian government official said: 'The realisation is crystalising that
free trade will not be complete in 1995. Computers, telecommunications,
electronics and capital goods will probably be subject to different tariffs
in 1995.'
Even so, despite the inter-governmental friction, companies are trading
more, creating more joint ventures and alliances. Companies are increasingly
treating Argentina, Brazil - and Chile - as a single market.
Trade within Mercosur last year rose by a third to an estimated Dollars
8.15bn. Brazil is Argentina's biggest export market. Argentina is Brazil's
second largest market and an important oil supplier. Trade has become more
evenly balanced: Argentina has increased exports to Brazil, cutting its
deficit by two-thirds to Dollars 504m in the nine months to September 1993.
Perhaps for these reasons alone, integration seems set to continue, however
unsteadily. It seems equally probable that the backbiting between Argentina
and Brazil is set to become a permanent feature of the local scene.

FT  07 JAN 94 / World Trade News: US accuses China of cheating on textiles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US yesterday accused China of massive cheating and trans-shipment of
clothing and textiles exports and slashed its textile and apparel quotas for
next year by 25 to 35 per cent.
Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, said China was doing nothing
to block at least Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.35bn) worth of illegal and
trans-shipped goods annually. Such shipments have undermined the US-China
quota arrangement, which allowed China average annual increases of 26 per
cent a year since 1991.
'While the US government wants to have a mutually beneficial textile trade
relationship with China, such a relationship must be based on fair trade
practices,' he said.
Mr Kantor's move brought cries of outrage from US importers. Ms Laura Jones,
executive director of the US Association of Importers of Textiles and
Apparel, said the US had offered 'only the flimsiest evidence' to support
its claims of widespread transshipments.
Although moving strongly against textiles, Mr Kantor had praise for China on
another front: its commitment to remove most of its import restrictions over
five years. In the second year of a bilateral market access pact, China has
removed restrictions on 258 products and taken important steps towards
opening its market to industrial goods.
'While the impact will be greatest beginning this year and next, US
companies have benefited already,' Mr Kantor said. Telecommunications
companies have already sold more than Dollars 500m worth of digital
switching equipment as a result of the agreement.
Even with the cuts in its textile quotas, China will continue to be the
largest supplier to the US of fabrics and clothing. Total exports in fiscal
1993 totalled Dollars 4.7bn.
The bilateral quota pact now has lapsed. Mr Kantor said the US is still
willing to negotiate a new one, but it must include a provision, similar to
the one concluded with 16 other countries, which allows the US to make quota
reductions when there is clear evidence of trans-shipment. Chinese officials
declined a US invitation to talks this week.
'Given the massive amount of trans-shipment experienced in recent years, it
would not be prudent to enter into an agreement with China without such
procedures,' Mr Kantor said.
While handing out praise and punishment together, Mr Kantor acknowledged
that he was also sending a message to China about US 'willingness to enforce
its trade agreements.' Ms Jones said the move was 'reckless' and would most
hurt US retailers.
'The US is playing with fire,' she said. 'Past experience indicates China
will not bow to heavy-handed pressure tactics.'

The Korean industrial giant Daewoo plans to invest Dollars 156m (Pounds
105m) in a joint venture in Romania which will manufacture cars for the
European market, the industry ministry said yesterday, Reuter reports from
Bucharest.
A ministry spokesman said this was the biggest foreign investment in Romania
to date. The joint venture will be set up this year as part of a
co-operation deal signed on Wednesday at the end of a visit to Romania by
Daewoo group executives, he said.
Daewoo will invest Dollars 156m and hold 51 per cent of the venture with
Oltcit SA, a state-owned factory at Craiova, 300km west of Bucharest. The
Korean group plans to use part of an existing plant and build lines to make
up to 200,000 Daewoo cars a year by 1998.

The Clinton administration yesterday was expected to announce a package of
legislative proposals to help the US airline and aircraft industries,
including one measure to permit increased foreign ownership of US airlines.
The proposals, set to be announced by Mr Federico Pena, the US
transportation secretary, will be based on recommendations prepared by a
presidential commission last summer. They are sure to provoke much
controversy in Congress, particularly one which would strip the Federal
Aviation Administration of its authority over air traffic control and
establish a quasi-governmental corporation to take over that responsibility.
After taking office, President Clinton moved swiftly to attack the problems
of the US airline and aircraft industries which have lost more than Dollars
10bn (Pounds 6.7bn) since 1990. The commission was given 90 days to make
recommendations. It found, among other things, that the US air
transportation system 'is being hobbled by self-imposed and
government-mandated attitudes and policies that are dysfunctional.'
It said the system must be made 'efficient and technologically superior' and
the FAA must be 'reinvented.'
The administration was expected to forgo one commission recommendation - a
rollback of ticket taxes from 8 to 5 per cent - on the grounds that the
airline industry is recovering. However, officials are ready to accept a
proposed change in law allowing the US to negotiate bilateral agreements
that permit foreign investors to hold up to 49 per cent equity in US
airlines.

<TEXT>
US Trade Representative Mickey Kantor said his government would cut the
import quotas for Chinese textile products by 25 to 35 per cent from January
17, Reuter reports from Washington.
Mr Kantor announced the unilateral action yesterday, following nine
unsuccessful months of negotiations between the two countries to control
illegal transshipments of Chinese-made products through third nations.
In a statement, Mr Kantor said the new quotas would be applied retroactively
to products entering the US after January 1.
China sold about Dollars 4.5bn in textile and apparel products to the US
last year. In addition, smuggling and illegal transshipments to the US,
which ignore rules on country of origin rules, were estimated at about
Dollars 2bn.
'We have said all along that, if we could not reach an agreement with China
which addressed the problems we have had with textile trade, then we would
have to impose quotas at the levels outlined in this notice,' Mr Kantor
said.
China has been unwilling to agree to provisions - accepted by 16 other
trading partners of the US - that allow US discipline when transshipping
occurs, Kantor said.
China did not accept a US offer for textile negotiations this week.

deregulation

<TEXT>
The success of Virgin Atlantic's first franchise operation, flying between
London and Athens, underlines how deregulation has opened up opportunities
for small airlines in Greece.
Until last year, Olympic Airways, the Greek state carrier, held a monopoly
of both international and domestic passenger services based in Greece. Its
subsidiary, Olympic Aviation, controls routes to the Aegean islands.
The Greek franchise-holder for Virgin Atlantic is South East European
Airlines, an Athens-based carrier set up three years ago to fly cargo and
small groups of tourists between Athens and the Aegean islands.
'Virgin provides the brand name and training to reach their standard of
service, and we operate the flight with our own crews,' Mr Tassos
Pantazopoulos, SEEA's chairman, said. 'To my knowledge, its the first
extension of franchising to the airline business.'
SEEA uses a leased Boeing 737-400 painted in Virgin livery for the daily
flight, timed to compete with departures by British Airways and Olympic.
Fares are 15-20 per cent lower than on the other carriers.
Mr Pantazopoulos said the passenger load factor averaged 80 per cent in the
first six months of operation, with 'a substantial percentage of regular
business travellers.'
The relationship with Virgin Atlantic has also given a boost to SEEA's plans
for growth. The company intends to start a new route from Thessaloniki to
Rome early next year using a Fokker 50 aircraft, to be followed by a
Thessaloniki-Bucharest flight.
Mr Pantazopoulos says that other destinations in the Balkans and former
Soviet Union, with flights originating in Thessaloniki where the airport is
less congested than in Athens, 'are the obvious option.'
Greece's only other private carrier, Cretan Airlines, has similar hopes of
becoming a regional airline, focused on the southern Mediterranean and the
charter market.
Set up last year by a group of hoteliers and tour operators on Crete, the
airline operates two Airbus A300-20, leased from Adria Airlines of Slovenia.
Cretan began regular charter flights last spring from several cities in
Germany, the main source of tourists.
The medium-term prospects for both airlines will depend on the outcome of
Olympic Airway's much-delayed plans for restructuring.

FT  07 JAN 94 / Fax diplomacy breaks the impasse: Israel and PLO to resume
full negotiations in Taba next week

<TEXT>
Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation yesterday ended more than a
week of stalled talks and fax diplomacy by agreeing to resume full
negotiations on Monday on an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho.
Israel set the stage for the resumption of stalled talks by announcing it
would release 101 Palestinian prisoners today as a goodwill gesture.
A joint PLO and Israeli announcement yesterday to meet again next week in
Taba, the Egyptian resort, breaks an impasse in the negotiations which
followed a row between PLO and Israeli officials over whether or not they
had reached a textual agreement of any kind during talks held last week in
Cairo.
The Cairo talks had been making progress before the row broke out. Only
after more than a week of public accusations and private fax exchanges have
both sides been able to agree that 'understandings' had been reached which
could provide the framework for the negotiations to resume.
Delegations from the two sides will now meet informally in Taba on Sunday
and will resume negotiations on the following day.
Mr Nabil Shaath, the chief Palestinian negotiator, said the delegations
would break into sub-groups, some of which would immediately begin drafting
parts of a final protocol on the Israeli withdrawal.
Mr Shaath said he believed final agreement on the withdrawal, which is
already weeks behind the December 13 deadline set in the PLO-Israeli accord
signed last year in Washington, could be achieved within two to three weeks.
'I'm optimistic that this is going to lead to the final stretch,' he said.
He added that he did not see the breakdown in talks as the result of 'bad
faith', but rather 'premature announcements' on the part of Israeli
officials.
'The crisis of the last week was not really about the substance of the
negotiations, but claims that there had been an agreement that was
violated.'
Central obstacles to a final agreement remain the control of border posts
into Gaza and Jericho, the delineation of Jericho itself, and security
arrangements at Israeli settlements.
However, Mr Shaath said in an interview that he believed differences had
already been significantly narrowed on the size of Jericho and security at
the settlements.
Israel 'had already indicated willingness' to release more imprisoned
Palestinians than the 600 they had already freed.
On the thorniest issue of border controls, Mr Shaath said there were
'important, creative options available' and that a solution would revolve
around the segregation of arrivals into the Palestinian enclaves by
nationality and types of travellers.

FT  07 JAN 94 / Danger signals flash on Malaysia's road ahead: There has
been a dramatic fall in foreign and domestic investment in the manufacturing
sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE

<DATELINE>
   KUALA LUMPUR
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Questioning the sturdiness of Malaysia's economy is rather like asking for a
plate of roast duck in a vegetarian restaurant. It is just not done.
After all, the economy turned in another healthy performance last year,
growing by at least 8 per cent - the sixth successive year of 8 per cent GDP
growth. People talk proudly of Malaysia's economic miracle.
Unemployment is under 3 per cent and the country is industrialising fast,
with manufacturing output up more than 13 per cent in the first nine months
of 1993.
But figures released yesterday showing a dramatic fall in both foreign and
domestic investment in Malaysia's manufacturing sector are likely to
introduce a sombre note amid all the economic euphoria.
Total investments in Malaysia's manufacturing sector in 1992 were MDollars
27.7bn (Pounds 7.1bn). In 1993 total proposed investments fell to MDollars
13.27bn. Within that figure foreign investment fell by 66 per cent to
MDollars 6bn.
Investment from domestic sources also fell sharply in 1993, by 27 per cent.
In 1992 domestic investment had fallen by more than 30 per cent.
Mrs Rafidah Aziz, Malaysia's minister for trade and industry, said
government investment targets were being met, despite the decline. Malaysia
had now accumulated nearly 90 per cent of the MDollars 80bn total investment
targeted under the present five year plan (1991-95); there was evidence of
more reinvestment, with existing investors expanding their operations.
The investment slowdown was not unique to Malaysia. 'Foreign direct
investment in other Asean countries also showed a marked decrease last
year,' Mrs Rafidah added. 'For example, Japanese investment in Asean in 1992
amounted to Dollars 3.86bn; in the first six months of 1993, it amounted to
only Dollars 1.33bn'. Investment in Asean by Taiwan and South Korea had
dropped even more sharply.
But the investment drop does present a serious challenge to Malaysia's
onward economic growth and its ambitious plans to become a fully
industrialised country by 2020.
One of the main reasons for the decline in foreign investment is that
Malaysia is no longer an attractive destination for labour-intensive
industries.
Wages in China and Vietnam are well below those in Malaysia. Malaysia is
facing serious labour shortage problems in many areas: again, China, Vietnam
and also Indonesia have a plentiful supply of cheap labour.
Malaysia says it wants to climb the technological ladder. It needs foreign
investment to achieve this goal. But it faces a dilemma. Malaysia has a
chronic lack of technicians and engineers. Malaysia's universities still
produce far more arts than science graduates. Thailand and the Philippines
have higher proportions of students in tertiary education than Malaysia.
Though the government is making a concerted attempt to revamp the education
system, the result will not be seen for some years. Meanwhile,
high-technology industry investors are going elsewhere.
For many years Singapore has been encouraging science and technical
education. Singapore is one of the region's most expensive investment
locations: yet according to official figures, foreign investments went up
again in Singapore last year - from SDollars 3.5bn (Dollars 2.3bn) in 1992
to SDollars 3.9bn.
The Malaysian government says that Malaysia must become less dependent on
outside investment and raise more from domestic sources. Despite the fact
that many Malaysian companies are sitting on considerable hoards of cash,
they are still often reluctant to commit themselves to long-term investments
in the home market.
Some economists blame the stock market for the tardiness of domestic
investment. The Kuala Lumpur index rose 98 per cent last year and the
bourse, in terms of market capitalisation, has become by far the biggest in
south-east Asia.
'Things have reached a dangerous stage,' one Malaysian economist said.
'There is plenty of cash about, but people prefer to make quick money on the
stock market than invest in long-term productive enterprises.
'The fundamentals of the economy have not changed much in the past nine
months, yet the market has roared ahead. People are beginning to think that
a booming stock market is synonymous with a thriving economy.'
A few more dark clouds lie on the economic horizon.
The government is seriously concerned about rising prices and upward
pressures on wages which could harm Malaysia's export competitiveness. The
official inflation rate rose to 3.5 per cent in October from 2.8 per cent in
mid-1993: many feel the actual inflation rate is higher.
Bank Negara, the central bank, has had to mop up large amounts of excess
liquidity in the system, caused by heavy inflows of foreign capital
attracted by comparatively high interest rates, a steady local currency, and
the high-flying stock market.
Earlier this week, Bank Negara announced it was raising the statutory
reserve requirement for banking institutions from 8.5 per cent to 9.5 per
cent, to help mop up excess liquidity and prevent further inflationary
pressures.
Malaysia's economic figures are still impressive, the envy of many
countries. But a few bumps are appearing along the high-speed road to full
industrialisation.

Japan's Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications said yesterday it planned
to promote the build-up of Japan's advanced telecommunications networks and
support their use for a range of multimedia services, including
broadcasting, which it believes could create markets worth Y123,000bn
(Pounds 736bn) by the year 2010.
Mr Takenori Kanzaki, posts and telecommunications minister, said yesterday
the government intended to help nurture that market as a key sector for the
future Japanese economy and that the multimedia market in Japan was expected
to create 2.4m jobs by that year.
The ministry's indication of support for multimedia, which combines
transmission of video, graphics and voice, reflects a growing recognition
that Japan will be left behind in advanced information and communication
services unless the government promotes infrastructure improvements and
relaxes the regulatory environment.
NTT, Japan's dominant telecommunications group, and electronics companies
have frequently complained that the country's strict rules separating
telecoms and broadcasting have hampered the move towards multimedia
services, such as video on demand, teleshopping and interactive television
which blur the boundaries between the two industries.
Under existing rules, NTT is prohibited from engaging in businesses that
fall outside its main sphere of providing telecommunications services so
that it cannot offer broadcasting services, for example, on its
telecommunications network.
Although such restrictions do not apply to Japanese cable television
companies, some of which offer telecommunications services, the scale on
which they operate is too small and their profitability too low for them to
build national operations. Telecommunications companies which compete with
NTT are also still relatively small in scale.
Japanese companies have been frustrated with the lack of direction on
multimedia from the Japanese authorities as they watched a growing number of
telecommunications and cable companies join hands in the US to lay the
foundation for the growth of promising multimedia markets there.
Mr Kanzaki's comments, which come ahead of a report in March by the
Telecommunications Council, raised hopes that the telecommunications
authorities intend to bring down the barriers separating telecommunications
from broadcasting in order to promote new businesses in those industries.
The news lifted shares in NTT by Y12,000 to Y778,000 as well as other
information and communications issues on the Tokyo Stock Exchange yesterday.
Together with recent indications that the Japanese authorities intend to
liberalise the country's cable television market, the possible deregulation
of telecoms and broadcasting also opens the door further to US
telecommunications and cable companies.

Japan yesterday politely rebuffed US warnings not to rely on the yen's
weakness to deliver a recovery, but said it would produce another round of
measures to stimulate the economy in the next few weeks.
'We should make efforts to stabilise the yen,' said Mr Masayoshi Takemura,
chief cabinet secretary. But he was not worried about the yen's weakness and
saw the Japanese currency's recent decline as a sign of the dollar's
strength, as shown by the US currency's rise against other leading
currencies such as the D-Mark.
Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, Japan's prime minister, said he would 'draw up
comprehensive economic measures by about the middle of January'. This would
take the form of a combined 1994-1995 budget and supplementary budget for
the current tax year, he told the upper house of parliament's political
reform committee. 'We will do all we can to dispel doubts about the future
as soon as possible.'
The government is unable to take economic initiatives so long as it remains
fully occupied trying to push plans to reform the political and electoral
system through the upper house of parliament. Attempts to launch an economic
package last month had to be shelved.
The opposition Liberal Democratic Party is using procedural blockages to
wring concessions on a new electoral system and over planned curbs on
political funding. These tactics have aroused growing alarm among
businessmen, formerly an important LDP power base. Japan's four leading
business federations warned that the recession will worsen if the wrangle
over political reform brings down the government.
'The government is under worldwide pressure to reflate. They know they
should try to fit in, but political reform has to come first. If we don't
get political reform this month, then we can expect an early general
election, and that will clearly be bad news for economic policy,' said Mr
Tom Hill, strategist at SG Warburg Securities in Tokyo.
Following the renewed US-Japan tension over the exchange rate, the yen
strengthened slightly from Y113 .33 to the dollar to Y112.65 in Tokyo
yesterday. At that level, the yen is still down 11.5 per cent from the
record high of Y101 to the US currency last August.
In private, Tokyo government officials hope for a continued fall in the yen
to about Y115 to the dollar. Businesses want an even steeper decline.
Exporters will only break even at Y120 to the dollar, said Mr Kosaku Inaba,
chairman of the Japan Chamber of Commerce - a level also cited by the
Keidanren business federation.

FT  07 JAN 94 / Terror main weapon in Yemen war of political wills: The Arab
nation's new-found democracy and unity are under threat
</HEADLINE>

The Yemeni government appears to be foundering in the wake of alleged links
with international terrorist groups, increased attacks on foreign workers
and riots over the rapidly-deteriorating economy.
According to Sheikh Abdullah bin Hussein al-Ahmar, speaker of the Yemeni
parliament, the political crisis in Yemen is passing through its worst
stages and may 'end Yemen's achievements in unity, democracy, and
parliamentary elections'.
The crisis began last August when vice president Ali Salem al Beidh head of
the Yemen Socialist Party, stalked out of Sanaa and returned to his
political base in Aden. Said to be angered by the marginalisation of his
party by a growing alliance between President Ali Abdullah Saleh's General
People's Congress and Sheikh Ahmar's Fundamentalist Islah Party, Mr Biedh
has remained in Aden, declining to participate in government until Gen Saleh
implements an 18-point programme of national reform mainly aimed at
improving internal security, integrating the two former armies and curbing
corruption, proposed by the socialists in late September. Gen Saleh has so
far not given in to Mr Biedh's demand and the resulting stand-off has left
Yemen in a state of economic and political disarray.
Economic problems were underscored on Tuesday when riots broke out in Taiz,
250km south of Sanaa. Spawned by an inflation rate which has jumped 50 per
cent since August, the riot was soon contained by government forces with no
deaths reported. But the riots, reminiscent of others in December 1992 which
left more than 100 dead, raised fears of widespread unrest as the Yemeni
riyal plunged from 70 to 100 to the dollar in unofficial trading on
Wednesday and yesterday
The government is also unable to control the growing number of attacks on
expatriates workers. Sent by helicopter to investigate the bombing of an oil
pipeline, two employees of the Yemen-Hunt oil company were kidnapped by
tribesmen on Tuesday and have yet to be released. Other tribesmen are
reported to have shot at employees of the Canadian Occidental oil company,
and at others working for Schlumberger, an oil-support group.
Yemen's political and economic headaches were compounded last week when Gen
Saleh had to fend off allegations that the US and Egyptian governments had
implicated his country in international terrorism. Although neither
Washington nor Cairo made the charges openly, the US State Department
nonetheless confirmed that there had been 'discussions' with Yemen about its
links with groups suspected of terrorism in Egypt.
Terrorism and assassination are hardly unknown in Yemen. Indeed, they have
almost become a way of life in the battle of political wits between Gen
Saleh and Mr Biedh who joined the formerly Marxist south Yemen into an
uneasy union with the tribalist north three years ago.  Since then the
country has been wracked by repeated violence, most of it directed against
the YSP. Victims, they say, of 150 political killings, members of the YSP
claim that General Saleh has turned a blind eye to terrorists and, in fact,
has shielded them for his own political purposes.
Yemen also had a direct brush with international terrorism in December 1992
with the bombing of two hotels in Aden, which left three dead and narrowly
missed about 100 US troops billeted there as part of Operation Restore Hope
in Somalia.
One group of suspects has been tried and convicted while another group is on
trial, charged with the formation of terrorist cells aimed at assassinating
prominent southern officials, blowing up key political and economic
installations, and establishing camps to train other terrorists. Prosecutors
say that the conspirators, many of them exiles from the former south,
confessed to being veterans of the war in Afghanistan and to having links
with backers in Sudan and Egypt. Apart from personal revenge against leaders
of the former south, the aim of the group, prosecutors say, was to undermine
Yemen's democratic government and replace it with a fundamentalist regime.
Ignored by the Saleh regime, with its close ties to fundamentalist groups
such as Islah, Aden security forces and the YSP sent details of the
terrorist organisation to Egyptian authorities in early December. Prompted
by the November 26 assassination attempt on the Egyptian prime minister, Mr
Atef Sidqi, Cairo placed Yemeni expatriates under surveillance, cut direct
telephone links between the two countries, and sent investigators to Yemen.
Since then, the Egyptians have discovered a further plot which, they say,
involves four other countries. Although the Egyptian prosecutor this week
declined to name them, speculation has since focussed on Iran, Afghanistan,
Sudan, and Yemen.
'The crisis has played a part in disfiguring Yemen's international
reputation in the sense that it is now threatened with blacklisting as an
international terrorist country,' Sheikh Ahmar says, tying the allegations
to the contest between General Saleh and Mr Biedh. But Yemen's reputation
may yet have more to suffer. French diplomatic sources this week in Sanaa
stated that France's counter-intelligence service, DST, has already warned
Yemen against possible connections with terrorist groups in Morocco,
Algeria, and Tunisia - connections which North African diplomats in Sanaa
have long quietly confirmed.

Cameroon said yesterday 500 Nigerian troops had occupied two of its islands,
Reuter reports from Yaounde.
Nigeria denied the claim and sent its foreign and industry ministers to
Yaounde for talks with President Paul Biya.
Mr Francis Nkwain, Cameroon's deputy foreign minister, said the Nigerian
troops arrived on Diamond and Djabane islands in the oil-producing Gulf of
Guinea on Monday.
He said the occupation was the worst border incident between the two
countries for more than a decade but could blow over peacefully. He could
not say if the troops used force or met any resistance.
The two West African countries have a long history of border disputes and
met in the Nigerian inland capital Abuja last year to try to settle their
differences.

FT  07 JAN 94 / Tajikistan swaps Soviet roubles for Russian ones

Most shops closed and goods were in short supply in the Tajikistan capital
of Dushanbe this week as the ex-Soviet republic began converting to the
Russian rouble. With its three-day phasing in of the rouble, to be completed
tomorrow, the Central Asian republic of 5.3m people is taking the final step
in ceding to Moscow almost complete control of its economy.
At Dushanbe's main bazaar, the republic's former currency, the old Soviet
rouble, plummeted against the dollar to 20,000 to 1, down from 8,000 Soviet
roubles to the dollar on Monday.
Residents of the capital crowded into banks to deposit up to 200,000 old
Soviet roubles, the maximum permitted without a depositor explaining the
source of the money.
The government did not set an official conversion rate of Soviet to Russian
roubles, contributing to the uncertainty about the new currency. Instead,
the government said it would issue a half-month's salary or pension in
Russian roubles to everyone yesterday. Money changers with inside contacts
in banks bought up the old currency, presumably expecting a windfall once
the conversion rate is announced.
Already Moscow decides every part of Tajikistan's budget, a step to which
the republic agreed because of the war that has shattered its economy. It is
supported by more than 25,000 Russian troops, and Moscow also has promised a
credit of Rbs100bn (Pounds 54m) to start its money supply, and thus far has
delivered Rbs40bn.
With the launching of the currency, Tajikistan becomes the only ex-Soviet
republic to adopt the Russian rouble. Belarus has not yet decided what to
do. But, in binding itself closely with Russia, Tajikistan could have been
encouraged by the mostly dismal performance of the national currencies
launched elsewhere in the ex-Soviet southern belt.
In the eight republics of the former Soviet Caucasus and Central Asian
regions, currency launches have been characterised by old style command and
control. Those who have tried the most to set their currency's value - or
those with wars, such as Armenia and Georgia - have generally had the worst
experience.
One example is Turkmenistan, which launched its 'manat' on November 1,
backed by Dollars 300m in European bank deposits. Foreign analysts expected
the currency's value to fall somewhat, but to be basically sound. Within
days, however, the Turkmen president, Mr Sapurmurat Niyazov, appeared on
national television, threatening to sack his national bank chairman, Mr
Khudaiderdy Ozerov, if the manat did lose value. Mr Ozerov has taken the
president at his word - the manat's official rate has hovered at about two
to the dollar. The street rate, meanwhile, has plummeted to 25 to the
dollar.
Mr Islam Karimov, the Uzbekistan president, has been so upset by the
divergence in the official and street rates for his som coupon - the
official rate is 1,150 som to the dollar, about one-fifth of the street rate
 -that his police have been rounding up citizens trading money in Tashkent
bazaars and parading them before nightly national television audiences.
The Kazakhstan tenge and Kyrgyzstan som have been the southern rim's
greatest successes, largely because the authorities have intervened the
least, but also because they have had a lot of help. For one, Kurdistan  -
the first non-Russian CIS country to launch its own currency - is backed by
an International Monetary Fund standby facility, and Kazakhstan appears
poised to be the second to be granted one.
The Kazakh government is still not conceding itself completely to the
market. 'The government promised floating exchange rates, but the auctions
seem relatively controlled,' said a western economist in the capital,
Alma-Ata.

<TEXT>
Attorney General Janet Reno yesterday rejected demands by Republicans in
Congress for a special prosecutor in an investigation involving President
Clinton's financial dealings in Arkansas and defended the way a subpoena had
been issued for his records, Reuter reports from Washington.
Asked by reporters at her weekly news conference if she thought the
political independence of the justice department had been preserved in the
serving of the subpoena two weeks ago, Ms Reno tersely replied, 'Yes.'
Mr Clinton's personal lawyer has advised the president to hand over the
records only under subpoena, thus assuring that the documents will not be
made public. But the subpoena caused top congressional Republicans to accuse
the justice department of colluding with the White House to shield documents
on Mr Clinton's role in the failed Arkansas real estate venture.
'It's mind-boggling to think that the White House and the justice department
would work together in a matter that might involve some criminal activity,'
Senate Republican leader Bob Dole said on Fox television's Morning News in
renewing his call for an independent special counsel.
House Republican leader Newt Gingrich on the NBC 'Today' programme
de-nounced as 'very, very disturbing' the way the subpoena had been handled.
'To have the White House going to the justice department to apparently
collude together to get a subpoena so the American people can't see the
documents - there's something a little bit sick about that kind of
approach,' he said.
White House spokeswoman Ms Dee Dee Myers said the personal lawyer for the
president and Hillary Rodham Clinton yesterday began to turn over the
documents, totalling five or six boxes of records.

The Mexican army sealed off main roads in the areas of conflict in southern
Mexico yesterday, as President Carlos Salinas warned that more violence
would generate 'hate and political closure.'
A communique purporting to be from representatives in Mexico City of the
rebels in the southern state of Chiapas, and published in Mexican newspaper
La Jornada, indicated that the insurgents plan to continue what they call
their fight against poverty and hunger.
The Mexican army has regained virtual control of the area and all the towns
that had been captured, although it has said isolated fighting with the
rebel Zapatista guerrillas, as they called themselves, continues.
The government had called on the rebels to lay down their arms as a
condition for peace. The communique, if it represents the views of the rebel
leaders, raises the prospect of a prolonged campaign.
Many of the rebels have fled back to the jungle.
Some 61 rebels have been killed.
The head of the government human rights commission promised yesterday to
investigate accusations that soldiers had executed rebels captured in the
town of Ococingo.
Mr Jorge Madrazo, president of the National Commission of Human Rights, told
reporters that he would investigate any alleged offences, including any by
the army.
His organisation has sent forensic experts to examine bodies of seven rebels
who appeared to have been shot in the back of the head at close range.
String was attached to their hands, and they had lesions on their wrists,
suggesting they had been tied up before being killed.
All were dressed in outfits of the peasant guerrillas.
President Salinas said yesterday the army and security forces have complied
with their responsibility according to the law. He said there was a clear
commitment to respect human rights.

<TEXT>
Brazil's car industry yesterday announced that 1993 was its best year since
the 1970s, with record car sales and increased profitability.
Vehicle production, dominated by US and European makers, increased almost 30
per cent to 1.39m units last year, compared with 1.07m in 1992.
Sales to the domestic market increased 43 per cent to 1.1m units, helped by
a moderate economic recovery and an agreement between the government and
manufacturers to lower prices for small cars.
Mr Luiz Scheuer, vehicle manufacturers' association president, said
production should continue to grow this year, although more modestly.
But motor executives admit privately that Brazil's overall economic
uncertainty, and a threatened tax increase on car sales, make predictions
difficult. Observers further caution that consumers are increasingly buying
cars as a hedge against inflation, which last year reached 2,500 per cent.
The figures also highlighted a rapid increase in foreign imports after the
1992 cut in import tariffs by former President Fernando Collor. According to
preliminary figures, imports roughly doubled to nearly 60,000 units in the
first 10 months of the year.
Excluding imports by companies such as Volkswagen, General Motors and Fiat
with operations in Brazil, imports more than doubled to 28,000 units and are
set to grow rapidly again this year, according to Mr Scheuer.

<TEXT>
US officials yesterday expressed frustration with Japanese negotiators who
have been in Washington this week to advance measures agreed at the Tokyo
summit to reduce Japan's massive trade surplus.
Ms Joan Spero, undersecretary of state for economics, said the Japanese
negotiators were 'quite rigid', refusing to discuss quantitivate and
qualitative economic indicators agreed in the negotiating framework set in
Tokyo.
'They are totally resisting any serious dialogue in automotive and auto
parts issues,' she said. 'We don't see any progress.'
Japanese negotiators are insisting that the US 'make appropriate efforts
such as product development and introduction of suitable vehicles', such as
those with right hand-steering, to penetrate the Japanese market.
'In January 1992, Japanese motor vehicle manufacturers announced voluntary
plans including procurement figures,' according to a Japanese position
paper. 'However, the US has intentionally or unintentionally treated these
plans as a commitment backed by the Japanese government.
'In light of such experience, the Japanese government cannot further
encourage Japanese motor vehicle manufacturers to submit voluntary plans
with numerical projections.'
Japanese negotiators say that their government is undergoing extensive
reform and is eliminating excessive government intervention in the private
sector. 'Hence, it shall refrain from exerting influence over the purchase
of US auto parts by private business,' they say.

FT  07 JAN 94 / Last of one of America's biggest spenders: Jurek Martin
offers a farewell salute to 'Tip' O'Neill, son of a bricklayer who rose from
Boston ward politics to become a powerful and respected Democratic Speaker
of the US House of Representatives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Most elected officials go through life without uttering a memorable
spontaneous sentence. 'Tip' O'Neill's most celebrated aphorism - 'all
politics is local' - must now be part of the universal political lexicon.
It is also the perfect epitaph of the man himself, christened Thomas Patrick
but always known by his nickname, who died of cardiac arrest in his home
town of Boston on Wednesday night. This son of a bricklayer spent a life in
politics, 34 years in the House of Representatives, rising to become its
powerful Speaker from 1977-86.
But he never lost a sense of his working-class roots, both his native Irish
ones and those from the Italians who made up a good part of his district.
He was, nonetheless, an intimate of the patrician Kennedy clan, inheriting
John Kennedy's House seat in 1952 and bequeathing it to the late president's
nephew, Joe Kennedy, in 1986.
He could be critical of them, once labelling Robert Kennedy a
'self-important upstart', but the Kennedy family was warm in its praise
yesterday, with Senator Edward Kennedy calling him 'a giant of a man, a
giant of a Speaker and a giant of a friend.'
O'Neill was raised in the ward politics of Boston. He was first elected as a
ward committeeman in 1936 while still a student at Boston College and became
a symbol of the city-based, ethnically sensitive Democratic Party, an
unrepentant partisan liberal proud to call himself 'one of the biggest
spenders of all time.'
His finest hours may well have been as the leading Democratic counterpoint
to President Ronald Reagan's determination to eviscerate the great social
welfare legislation in th US that O'Neill had spent his career helping to
create. At the time, his party was demoralised, having lost not only the
presidency in 1980 but also control of the Senate - though not the House.
By the time the Speaker stepped down, the Democrats were on the way to
recovery and Mr Reagan's second term was proving nothing like as productive
as his first.
O'Neill, though a conspicuous patriot, was always suspicious of foreign
adventures and, in 1967, he was one of the first Congressional Democrats to
break publicly with President Johnson over the Vietnam war, which, he said,
was 'too high a price to pay for an obscure and limited objective.' He was
an equally sharp critic of the Reagan administration's interventions in
Central America and, after initial support, in Lebanon.
He derided Mr Reagan in public, once memorably calling him 'the least
knowledgeable of any president I've ever met on any subject.' Yet,
typically, he got on well with Mr Reagan in private, as he did with
politicians of all stripes, over a drink or on the golf course. Even
President Nixon, for whom he had little time, paid him the true, albeit
backhanded, comment in 1984: 'He plays hardball; he doesn't know what a soft
ball is.'
At 6ft 3 ins tall, 250-plus pounds, with flowing white locks and a permanent
air of the rumpled, he was a dominant figure in more ways than one, the
dream of critical cartoonists who loved to portray him as the quintessential
Congressional manaager of the pork barrel.
For much of his career before he became Speaker, this was mostly what he
was, a self-confessed backroom politician, mostly interested in the welfare
state and the needs of his constituents, who returned the compliment by
always returning him to the House easily, sometimes unopposed, 16 times. He
used to arrive in Washington on Tuesday morning, go back to Boston on
Thursday night, and did most of his deals on the golf course, in poker games
and over dinner.
In 1976, though, he became Speaker at a time when the House was in great
flux, its long-standing seniority system in tatters and his predecessor,
Carl Albert, virtually unknown to the wider public. The Bostonian determined
to give his office, and the House, a higher profile, using the media to the
maximum advantage.
This paid particular dividends in his battles with Mr Reagan, whom Mr
O'Neill ackowledged as a master of communications. But it was a strategy
that also encouraged more Congress members to become more independent as
they sought the media limelight. Today, party discipline in the US Congress
is worse than it ever was, a by-product of which he profoundly disapproved.
A partisan to the end, 'Tip' O'Neill would have appreciated the comments
yesterday by another partisan from the other side of the fence. Senator Bob
Dole, the Republican minority leader said: 'I considered him one of my best
friends in all my time in Congress. No doubt about it, he was a
Congressman's Congressman who will go down in American history as one of the
great political leaders of our time.'

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BUENOS AIRES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Argentina's feared tax inspectors are investigating suspected large-scale
tax evasion at the country's trade unions. The investigation co-incides with
a bitter dispute between President Carlos Menem's Peronist government and
Peronist union bosses and over labour market reform and union funding.
The unions have threatened to call a general strike this month in protest at
the government's decision to cut company tax contributions to union-run
welfare funds, part of the strategy of Mr Domingo Cavallo, economy minister,
for reducing Argentina's high labour costs.
The cuts, variously estimated at the equivalent of Dollars 400m-Dollars 800m
(Pounds 269m-Pounds 538m) a year, strike at the heart of the unions'
finances. The money, which together with union dues and employee
contributions adds up to about Dollars 2bn a year, is channelled into union
health and welfare funds.
It is widely suspected union leaders skim money from these funds to finance
their luxurious lifestyles.
Mr Ricardo Cossio, head of the tax department, said yesterday he was also
investigating bosses' personal wealth. But, he said, 'there is absolutely no
link to political problems.'
This cuts little ice with the union leaders, who complain of 'persecution.'
Mr Menem, who is attempting to stand for a second presidential term, clearly
feels he has little to fear from union opposition.

Top Republicans accused the US Justice Department yesterday of colluding
with the White House to shield documents related to President Bill Clinton's
involvement in a failed Arkansas real estate venture, Reuter reports from
Washington.
'It's mind-boggling to think that the White House and the Justice Department
would work together in a matter that might involve some criminal activity,'
said Mr Bob Dole, the Senate Republican leader, speaking on the Fox Morning
News.
'I don't know of any precedent for this,' he said.
'It seems to me this cries out for an independent counsel.'
The White House said on Wednesday that Mr Clinton's personal lawyer had
arranged to have the Justice Department subpoena records on Whitewater
Development, the failed vacation-home developer.
The subpoena had the effect of sealing the documents, closing them to public
scrutiny.
Ms Dee Dee Myers, the White House spokeswoman, said the White House began
yesterday to turn over the files, which she said amounted to 5 or 6 boxes of
material.
The files include 'things rounded up during the campaign, from accountants,
anything that (Clinton's lawyer) thinks is relevant,' as well as documents
discovered in deputy White House counsel Mr Vincent Foster's office after
his suicide on July 20, she told reporters.
Mr Newt Gingrich, number-two Republican in the House, yesterday called the
way the documents were supplied to the Justice Department 'very, very
disturbing.'
Republicans have been calling for an independent counsel to investigate
Clinton's dealings over Whitewater.
The Clintons deny any wrongdoing.

The Georgian government said yesterday it had sent officials to investigate
the reported death of ousted president Zviad Gamsakhurdia, but the head of
state, Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, said his demise would make little difference
to the country, Reuter reports from Tbilisi.
Mr Shevardnadze's office said a team of interior minister officials, headed
by the deputy prosecutor-general, had left for the western region of Zugdidi
to try to establish the truth about Mr Gamsakhurdia's fate.
The former leader's wife, Mrs Manana Gamsakhurdia, said on Wednesday that
her husband had killed himself on New Year's Eve after the failure of his
latest attempt to return to power. With the whereabouts of Mr Gamsakhurdia's
body unknown, conflicting versions of his reported death surfaced, and at
least one of his aides rejected the reports as disinformation.
However, a senior official of Chechnya republic, a southern Russian region
where Mr Gamsakhurdia had spent most of his exile since being ousted two
years ago, said it was certain the Georgian ex-president was dead.
'The leadership of Chechnya possesses reliable information about the death
of Zviad Gamsakhurdia,' said Mr Shamsudin Yusef, the Chechen foreign
minister.
The Itar-Tass news agency quoted the Chechen president, Mr Dzhokar Dudayev,
as saying that Mr Gamsakhurdia had died 'to stop the bloodshed' in his
homeland.
Mr Shevardnadze told Itar-Tass that Mr Gamsakhurdia, his bitter rival, was
in any case a 'political corpse'. His death, if confirmed, was of little
importance for the country, he said.
Earlier, in an interview with Reuter, Mr Shevardnadze also rejected reports
that Mr Gamsakhurdia, 54, chose to end his life after being encircled in a
military operation. 'We did not track him down, and indeed there was no need
to do that, because we believed, and still believe, he did not represent a
serious political force,' he said.

The presidents of Croatia and Bosnia will meet tomorrow in Bonn in a move
aimed at reaching agreement on an agenda for peace talks which re-open in
Geneva next week.
Presidents Alija Izetbegovic of Bosnia and Franjo Tudjman of Croatia will
hold talks with Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, the international
peace negotiations at Petersberg, the German government's official guest
house. German officials, who yesterday said they were surprised about being
asked to host the discussions, said they might help pave the way for
progress at the Geneva peace talks.
However an angry Mr Izetbegovic yesterday demanded the UN Security Council
stop a rebel Serb assault on Sarajevo, a daily bombardment he said the world
watched in silence. His demand came after the fiercest fighting in months
killed eight people and wounded at least 61.
In Washington US officials warned that air strikes against Serbian forces
was a 'live option' in view of the intense bombardment of Sarajevo.
A German diplomat said growing international pressure on Croatia to stop
interfering in the war in Bosnia, as well as continuing sanctions on Serbia,
might lead to some compromises. 'We need a political settlement. But all
three sides must be ready for it.' Croatia yesterday said it would present
new proposals for peace in Bosnia at the weekend summit but Zagreb's
ambassador to Germany, did not specify what they would be.
Lord Owen and Mr Stoltenberg yesterday warned that the war in Bosnia was
stunting economic and political development in eastern Europe
On a diplomatic shuttle in the run-up to the resumption of peace talks, Lord
Owen called on Hungary to exert pressure on its southern neighbours to end
the war.

The Russian economy posted a drop in inflation, stability in industrial
output and a rise in real wages and prices during the last quarter of 1993,
according to figures released yesterday by the Centre for Economic Reforms.
Wages averaged Dollars 105 (Pounds 70.90) a month in December, with prices
at about 30 per cent of those in the US.
Mr Andrei Illarionov, the centre's deputy director, said yesterday that the
level of inflation, down to around 12 per cent last month, would drop to
about 10 per cent a month in the first quarter of this year. But he warned
that a rise in the budget deficit this quarter would mean a further surge of
inflation from April. On present policies, unemployment would rise from its
present level of about 1m to around 3m during this year.
The squeeze on inflation, running at nearly 30 per cent in August, has been
accomplished by a drop in credits issued to commercial banks and to the
other former Soviet states. Figures from the centre show no credits were
advanced to neighbouring states from October, after a rate of advance which
in July reached nearly 5 per cent of Russian GDP.
Mr Illarionov said the drop in inflation meant the central bank's interest
rates, now at some 17 per cent a month, were strongly positive for the first
time. If these trends continued, interest rates would be brought down.
The rate of the rouble against the dollar has stabilised since September, at
just over 1,200 to Dollars 1. But the real exchange rate against the dollar
has dropped to about 10 per cent of its level two years ago.
Mr Illarionov said the growing price levels were putting increasing pressure
on Russian exporters.
One of the 'sharpest political questions' in the next few months would be
the demand for protection and increased import tariffs.

FT  07 JAN 94 / Italian cabinet defends drug reform: Government will listen
to manufacturers' objections
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The Italian cabinet has defended its reform of drug sales, despite
continuing confusion among the public and bitter attacks from pharmacists
and drugs companies.
Mrs Maria Pia Garavaglia, health minister, said the government would listen
to manufacturers' objections to the amended list of free medicines. But the
cabinet refused to suspend or substantially alter the new list, in which
medicines are divided into three categories based on being free, subsidised
or sold at full price. 'I am sure the long-term benefits are worth the
short-term difficulties,' she said.
Companies have a 30-day period to appeal against the removal of products
from the new free list, which came into effect on January 1. Mrs Garavaglia
said after a cabinet meeting on Wednesday night that officials would meet
soon to 'register difficulties and suggest remedies'.
The only change the cabinet made was to cut penalties on pharmacists and
doctors dispensing drugs without prescriptions. Maximum fines on pharmacists
selling drugs requiring prescriptions without a doctor's authorisation have
been halved; repeat offenders will no longer risk enforced closure of their
shops. Fines on doctors will be halved.
The confusion follows the simultaneous introduction last Saturday of two
reforms. The first imposed a new list of free medicines under the
government's plans to hold spending on drugs to L10,000bn (Pounds 3.95bn) in
1994. Pharmacists have also had to enforce much stricter rules on dispensing
drugs without prescriptions.
The reforms triggered bitter scenes at pharmacies as patients have reacted
angrily to having to pay for drugs previously free, or to being turned away
because they lacked prescriptions. Prof Luigi Frati, head of the committee
which drew up the list, said the new rules were not designed for
pharmacists, but to cover patients' needs.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
In the run-up to the Nato summit on Monday, Germany's foreign and defence
ministries, have put aside their differences about the alliance's
relationship with eastern Europe.
However, the government consensus is being overshadowed by a debate in the
media and between deputies in Chancellor Helmut Kohl's governing Christian
Democrats who want the summit to offer eastern European countries either a
concrete timetable for eventual membership, or security guarantees for the
region.
The differences between the foreign and defence ministries are two-fold. Mr
Volker Ruhe, the defence minister, has argued that eastern Europe should be
brought quickly under Nato's security umbrella, leading eventually to
membership. Mr Klaus Kinkel, the foreign minister, prompted by his Russian
desk, advises more caution, fearing that any commitment to include eastern
Europe would be at the expense of isolating Russia and would play into the
hands of the ultra-nationalists there.
At the same time, the foreign ministry wants closer links between Nato and
eastern Europe - and Russia - to run in parallel with the European Union's
links with the region. The defence ministry plays down the importance of
this linkage.
'Some capitals do want to have this kind of parallel process,' a German
diplomat said. 'But if you were really cynical, that would mean that eastern
Europe would never join Nato because the EU is reluctant to offer full
membership to the region. Look at the way it still has trade barriers for
the region,' he added.
Yet according to CDU deputies, it is precisely the rise of nationalism in
the former Soviet Union, in particular Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky's far-right
wing Liberal Democratic party, and the crisis in the former Yugoslavia,
which necessitates a Nato extension of its security umbrella to eastern
Europe.
The conservative Frankfurter Allgemeine daily newspaper said in an editorial
yesterday thatthe whole debate about Nato's relationship with eastern Europe
was really about the need for Nato to re-define its role in a way which
would provide security in regions which could threaten the west.

FT  07 JAN 94 / IMF-World Bank warning on Russia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund are urging western
countries not to abandon the tough economic policy conditions they have
placed on financial aid to Russia.
Making loans conditional on policy reforms, the two Washington institutions
argue in an unusual joint note on their operations in Russia, is the best
way of speeding up the process of stabilising the Russian economy and
bringing about an early improvement in living standards.
Officials from the IMF and the World Bank criticised the Russian government
for not following through an attack on inflation and for maintaining
inefficient subsidies to vested interests such as state businesses and
collective farms, at the expense of vulnerable groups such as pensioners and
teachers.
'Despite announced policy intentions, Russia has produced an extremely
gradual approach to the reduction of inflation. Experience elsewhere
suggests that this is not an effective way of minimising economic hardship
or maximising political support,' the joint note says.
The IMF and the World Bank, as well as the western donor nations, have been
criticised both in Russia and the west for being slow to fulfil their
promises of financial aid to Russia.
The IMF has so far lent Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.7bn) to Russia, some of it
under a scheme specially devised to ease the conditions for lending money to
the former Soviet states. A disbursement of another Dollars 1.5bn under this
scheme, however, has been held up while the IMF waits for evidence of an
effort to curb inflation and the budget deficit.
After the surprising success in last month's Russian elections of the
extreme right-wing followers of Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, some policy makers
in the west have questioned whether shock therapy was the right approach to
Russia's economic problems.
In the US, the vice-president, Mr Al Gore, suggested that the IMF should
loosen its conditions for further disbursement, while Mr Strobe Talbott, who
has been nominated to become deputy secretary of state, said the Russian
people needed 'less shock and more therapy'.
But Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the treasury secretary, appears to have prevailed in a
debate within the US administration on policy towards Russia, arguing that
there is no alternative for Russia to carrying out the painful measures
needed to stabilise its economy.
President Bill Clinton this week said that more attention needed to be paid
to the construction of a social safety net to mitigate the consequences of
reform, but that should not mean any slowing of reform.
The joint IMF-World Bank note urges Russia to pursue a macro-economic
stabilisation programme built on cutting the growth of central bank credit,
limiting the 1994 budget deficit and maintaining a liberal price and
exchange system. It goes on to advocate structural reforms, including
expanded privatisation, changes to insolvency and ownership laws, and
improvement of the banking system.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Polish finance ministry is considering imposing a transaction tax on
share dealings on the Warsaw Stock Exchange to head off criticism of its
budget proposals, presented to parliament yesterday.
The move came as the new centre-left government braced itself for criticism
on its budget from its own parliamentary supporters. The budget constituted
a concession to left-wingers in the Left Democratic Alliance (SLD)
parliamentary group.
The exchange enjoys a general tax holiday due to run until the end of 1995.
Mr Leszek Miller, labour minister, argues his ministry's budget should be
increased and has threatened to call for a capital gains tax if his demand
is refused.
The draft budget's spending and deficit targets are within International
Monetary Fund guidelines. Mr Marek Borowski, finance minister, yesterday
urged his coalition deputies, who enjoy a clear majority in parliament, not
to change it when it goes into committee stage.
The proposed budget assumes revenues will reach 610,000bn zlotys (Pounds
19.3bn) this year while the 83,000bn zloty deficit will correspond to 4.1
per cent of GDP. The mooted 1 per cent transaction tax on exchange dealings
would raise around 2,500bn zlotys this year, but could engineer a crash just
as the government is looking to a series of flotations to move ahead with
its privatisation programme.

DIW, the Berlin-based economics institute, yesterday warned that Germany's
recession will continue this year despite recent improvements in the economy
and urged policy-makers to change course and stimulate investment.
'The chances that that situation will be worse this year are greater than
those for an improvement,' the institute said in its January report. It says
demand and investment are set to continue declining in 1994, thus hampering
prospects for a sustainable recovery.
DIW's pessismistic outlook was highlighted this autumn when it broke ranks
with Germany's other economic institutes and predicted a 0.5 per cent
decline in GDP for this year. The other institutes are forecasting modest
GDP growth of 1 per cent in 1994.
Their brighter prognosis was recently bolstered by a pick-up in foreign
orders reported by the economics ministry, paving the way for export-led
recovery in 1994.
Foreign orders, while down in December by 1.5 per cent, rose on a two
months-basis by 3.5 per cent in October-November.
The economics ministry favours two-months comparisons because they remove
the impact of short-term influences.
The ministry expects GDP to continue rising in the fourth quarter of 1993
after it climbed by 0.5 per cent for the two preceding quarters.
But the DIW yesterday warned that such improvements would not be enough to
promote stable growth as long as demand and investment remained depressed.
It pointed out that GDP rose for three consecutive quarters in the 1981-1982
recession while plunging again because of lagging demand.
Private demand, which was hit by increases in petrol taxes and pension
contributions at the beginning of the month, is expected to decline by 1.5
per cent this year, according to DIW and the other economics institutes.
And over 40 per cent of German companies said in recent polls that they did
not plan to increase investments this year.
The institute argues that the government should change to an investment
stimulation programme instead of continuing to squeeze public sector
spending. Structural cuts in public sector spending - such as those proposed
by Bonn to keep the budget deficit under control - should be carried out as
soon as economic recovery is under way, but not before, it says.
It also calls on the Bundesbank to accelerate the pace of lowering
short-term interest rates in order to push investments up, instead of
continuing slow and steady downwards moves.
However, despite claims earlier this week that the Bundesbank council was
agreed that lower short-term interest rates were needed to ease the effects
of recession, it made no changes at its meeting in Frankfurt yesterday.
A decision to continue offering securities repurchase, or 'repo', deals at a
fixed 6 per cent rate for a further two weeks was seen as a way of
maintaining calm in money markets.
At its next meeting on January 20 the council will have more key data
available on which to base its decisions, including the initial effects on
inflation of a round of January 1 tax and duty increases. Up-to-date money
supply figures, also crucial to the bank's deliberations, were not ready.

<TEXT>
Russia yesterday gave a clear warning to Nato leaders not to offer east
European countries and Lithuania membership of the alliance, as this could
boost extreme nationalist tendencies in Russia and undermine its reform
programme.
President Boris Yeltsin's spokesman, Mr Vyacheslav Kostikov, speaking before
Nato's summit in Brussels at the beginning of next week, said that an
eastward enlargement of Nato would enrage the Russian military and oblige
Moscow to contemplate creating its own politico-military organisation.
'I think that the army would exert strong pressure on the government and the
president to respond,' Mr Kostikov said. Eastern European countries, such as
Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic and the former Soviet republic of
Lithuania, fearful of the consequences of domestic upheavals in Russia and
more Yugoslav-style conflicts in Europe, are all looking to the summit for
an offer of membership as soon as possible.
Anxious not to make President Yeltsin's task any harder than it already is
by boosting Russian nationalism and traditional paranoia about western
expansionism, Nato leaders intend to remain vague about offers of membership
and to refrain from giving any specific security guarantees.
Instead, they are expected to propose bilateral agreements between the
alliance and any former Soviet bloc state which desires them, which would
allow close military co-operation, including joint exercises and training
for peacekeeping missions.
'We don't want to give the impression that we're creating another dividing
line in Europe,' President Bill Clinton said earlier this week.
By their 'Partnership for Peace' plan Nato leaders will strive to kill two
birds with one stone: to include Russia and former Soviet republics such as
the Ukraine in the security partnership as well as assuaging the anxieties
of anxious eastern European states.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Le Monde, the traditional bastion of the French press, on Monday joins the
increasingly bitter battle in the newspaper industry by launching InfoMatin,
a new morning paper.
The launch of InfoMatin, which comes when the French press is badly bruised
by recession, will follow a few days after Wednesday's introduction of
Aujourd'hui, the national version of Le Parisien, the popular Parisian
tabloid.
Both new titles are going on sale at cut prices - Aujourd'hui for FFr3.50
(40 pence) and InfoMatin for FFr3. Both will be cheaper than existing French
dailies, including Le Monde at FFr7 and Le Parisien at FFr4.50.
InfoMatin, which is backed financially by Le Monde, will be slightly smaller
than a tabloid paper. It is intended to appeal to the young, urban readers
outside Paris who have eluded Le Monde in recent years. Aujourd'hui, also
aimed at a young readership, will be a regionalised version of Le Parisien
to be distributed outside Paris and the surrounding Ile de France area.
The price-cutting tactics of InfoMatin and Aujourd'hui threaten to intensify
the fierce competition within the French press where circulation and
advertising revenue are already under intense pressure.
France's newspapers and magazines, like other areas of the economy, have
been badly affected by the recession. But these general problems have been
aggravated by the instability caused by the reform of the media buying
system implemented by Mr Michel Sapin, the former socialist finance
minister.
Mr Sapin's law, which has transferred responsibility for media buying from
intermediaries such as advertising agencies to advertisers themselves, has
triggered a shift in media expenditure to television, thereby contributing
to a reduction in press advertising rates of up to 25 per cent.
Some titles have already come under strain. LVMH, the luxury goods group,
last year took over La Tribune Desfosse, the financial daily.
Alcatel-Alsthom, the engineering group, bought into Le Point, the weekly
news magazine. L'Humanite, the old communist paper, is seeking new capital
to try to defuse its financial difficulties.

Mr Edmond Alphandery, the French economy minister, yesterday confirmed that
he plans to table legislation for a radical reform of the Caisse des Depots
et Consignations, the state-controlled savings institution, writes Alice
Rawsthorn.
The reform of the Caisse des Depots, an idiosyncratic institution which
dominates the French savings system and is involved with public sector
funding, has been mooted since the conservatives came to office.
France's banks have lobbied for it to be dismantled in order to open up the
savings market. Mr Alphandery said he feltthat its public sector interests
and competitive activities should be separated.

The French government will decide by the end of the first quarter of the
year whether to implement measures to stimulate the economy, Mr Edmond
Alphandery, the economy minister, said yesterday.
Mr Alphandery, speaking at a business conference, said that it was necessary
to assess the current economic performance before deciding on expansionary
measures. But he added that the strong performance of exports was supporting
the economy and would help achieve the target of a 1.4 per cent rise in
gross domestic product this year.
The two principal uncertainties, according to Mr Alphandery, are the
prospects for consumer spending and the performance of the German economy,
France's principal trading partner. He noted, however, that it would take
only a small shift from savings to reach the government's target of a 0.7
per cent increase in consumer spending.
The economy minister said that an expected decline in interest rates should
also help economic recovery.
The government, which has surrendered control of monetary policy to the
newly independent bank of France, has based its economic projections for
this year on average three-month borrowing costs of 5.3 per cent, compared
with the current level of just over 6 per cent.
The economy minister said that the government's priorities this year
included a reduction of the public sector deficit and the fight against
unemployment. With respect to unemployment, he said that measures were
needed to increase the number of jobs in the service sector and to
facilitate youth employment.
Mr Alphandery's comments followed remarks from the socialist president, Mr
Francois Mitterrand, who called for stronger measures to curb the rise in
unemployment, currently more than 12 per cent of the workforce.
'We have to create jobs, millions of jobs. We have to turn the tide of
unemployment,' said Mr Mitterrand in a new year's address to unions and
employers. In a criticism of Mr Edouard Balladur's government, Mr Mitterrand
also questioned the transfer last year of FFr80bn to French industry which,
he said, had not affected unemployment.

FT  07 JAN 94 / Asian markets fall on profit-taking

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Two of Asia's best performing stock markets plunged yesterday as a leading
Japanese bank downgraded their weightings in its model portfolio.
Hong Kong fell 6.5 per cent, its biggest single day fall since the 1987
stock market crash, after Nomura cut its weighting from 8 per cent to 7 per
cent. Kuala Lumpur shed 5 per cent, its largest ever one-day tumble, as its
weighting was cut from 2 per cent to zero.
Mr Nicholas Knight, a Nomura strategist, said the time had come to take
profits in Hong Kong after the market's very strong run.
Much of last year's 115 per cent rise came in the last quarter after Nomura
and Morgan Stanley in the US became aggressively bullish over the prospects
for the market, pulling in US and Japanese funds.
Mr James Osborn, sales director with Baring Securities in Hong Kong, said:
'Obviously there were some people running for the door. But bearing in mind
the market has gone up so much, investors can afford to sell down and still
be taking home profit, even from investments made 10 days ago.'
Mr Osborn said he thought the big sell-off came from local rather than
overseas investors. He said international institutions, especially the
Japanese, who have been relatively late entrants, were taking a longer term
view and could afford to ride out the inevitable bouts of profit-taking.
Bangkok fell 2.4 per cent and Singapore was marked 1.8 per cent lower. But
there were bright spots. Tokyo was firm as Nomura raised its weighting from
10 to 15 per cent and Manila shrugged off a downgrading from 2 per cent to
zero as the market picked up. Australia remained at a six-year high.

FT  07 JAN 94 / Lloyd's expects a substantial rise in business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lloyd's, the London insurance market, expects to increase its business
substantially this year, despite reporting record losses in 1993 and earlier
fears of an erosion of its capital base.
The market's capacity - the premiums its underwriting syndicates are allowed
to accept - is expected to rise to between Pounds 10.5bn and Pounds 11bn in
1994, from Pounds 8.7bn in 1993, according to figures released yesterday.
Of the fresh capacity, Pounds 1.6bn will be supplied by new corporate
investment trusts. But Names have also increased their commitments. On
average, they will underwrite Pounds 505,000 each in 1994, compared with
Pounds 454,000 in 1993.
Provisional figures indicate that 954 of Lloyd's 19,537 Names have resigned
and 180 have died over the past 12 months. Only 63 new individual Names will
begin underwriting in 1994.
'Our members have been very resilient,' said Mr David Rowland, chairman.
Lloyd's, which completes its accounts three years in arrears, reported
losses of Pounds 2.9bn for the 1990 underwriting year, and expects to record
another year of losses of more than Pounds 1bn when it reports for 1991 in
May. But the market expects to make profits in 1993 and 1994, as a result of
steep increases in insurance rates and greater efficiency.
In a separate move, Lloyd's said yesterday it was extending the deadline for
acceptance of its Pounds 900m settlement offer to 22,921 loss-making Names
by two weeks to February 14.
The delay follows amendments to the original settlement offer which
contained arithmetical and other errors.
Mr Rowland said the majority of affected Names will 'receive an increased
offer' but that many would suffer a reduction. Nearly Pounds 20.83m will be
redistributed from 10,071 Names to 12,850 other Names.
The offer is designed to settle litigation by more than three dozen groups
of Names who are claiming compensation from their agents for billions of
pounds of losses. Each Name will receive a 'bespoke' offer with compensation
varying according to exposure to loss-making syndicates, membership of
Names' action groups and the progress of legal action.
Lloyd's confirmed it was 'unlikely' that loss-making Names who refuse to
accept the settlement offer will be able to claim so-called 'hardship'
relief.
It emerged yesterday that losses incurred between 1986 and 1991 and faced by
4,500 Gooda Walker Names increased during 1993 by Pounds 94.6m. GW Run-Off,
the agency managing the syndicates' affairs, said the losses of syndicates
164, 290, 295, 296, 298 and 299 amounted to Pounds 835m at the end of 1993
and could total Pounds 1.1bn.

FT  07 JAN 94 / Retail stocks depressed by static sales at Dixons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dixons, the electrical retailer, sent a shiver through the retail sector
yesterday with the news that its Christmas sales were no better than last
year. However, Boots restored some confidence to the sector with news of a 7
per cent sales increase.
Dixons' comments contrasted sharply with reports of strong retail trading in
the two weeks before Christmas. It depressed many share prices in the stores
sector, although analysts said Dixons' comments were not unexpected, and not
representative of the rest of the high street.
Dixons shares fell 43p to 240p after the group warned that operating profits
this year were unlikely to match last year's. Kingfisher, owner of the Comet
electrical chain, fell 15p to 747p; MFI, the furniture retailer, lost 5p to
162p; and catalogue retailer Argos fell 3p to 374p. But clothing retailers'
shares were largely unaffected.
Mr John Clare, chief executive, said Dixons was unusual in that it had
enjoyed a 17 per cent increase in sales for Christmas 1992, when many other
retailers fared badly, due to huge sales of computer games.
A damaging price war this year in the games console market, started in
November by Kingfisher's Woolworths and Comet chains, had led to a sharp
fall in profit margins, even though sales volumes were similar.
While Dixons was selling Sega Megadrive consoles for Pounds 169 in December
1992, and expected to sell them for Pounds 129 this Christmas, it ended up
charging as little as Pounds 89 in some branches.
Camcorder sales were also weaker, but sales of television sets and video and
audio equipment were well ahead. Not counting games consoles, Dixons saw a 9
per cent increase in sales values over the seven-week Christmas period.
Statements from other retailers helped dispel the gloom. Rhino, the
specialist computer and video game chain, said Christmas trading was 'strong
and in line with expectations'. Boots, which makes up to half its annual
profits in the final three months of the year, announced a 7.2 per cent
increase in retail sales for the period.
Sales were 6.3 per cent up at Boots the Chemists, helped by a strong
performance by health and beauty care and gifts; 10.6 per cent up at Boots
Opticians; 10.1 per cent up at Halfords, helped by strong bicycle sales;
28.7 per cent up at Children's World, due to strong sales of baby and
fashion clothing; and up 1.1 per cent at A G Stanley, the decorating chain.
Boots shares closed down 5p at 582p.

FT  07 JAN 94 / Gore backs E Europe-Nato links
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
US vice-president Al Gore yesterday defended President Bill Clinton's
'Partnership for Peace' proposal for bringing the countries of eastern
Europe into closer association with Nato.
Mr Gore (pictured giving the speech in Milwaukee) argued that supporting the
countries of eastern Europe was in the US's best interests. 'Fostering the
integration of Europe will not only express our highest ideals, it will also
be the best investment we can make in our own security,' he said.
Earlier Russia had warned Nato leaders not to offer east European countries
and Lithuania membership of the alliance, as this could boost extreme
nationalist tendencies in Russia and undermine its reform programme.

FT  07 JAN 94 / Russian deal with Belarus alarms reformers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Russia and Belarus have signed an agreement in principle that in effect
incorporates Belarus into the Russian economy - a move that has alarmed
Moscow's reformers.
The agreement, reached in secret by the two governments, could be the
forerunner of attempts to integrate other former Soviet republics in a
reconstruction of much of the old Soviet Union.
The possible damaging effect on reform moves has upset the Russian reformist
politicians battling for a place in the new cabinet whose structure is now
under discussion between President Boris Yeltsin and Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin,
the prime minister.
One source close to the reformers said last night: 'If this agreement
stands, the reformers have no place in the government.'
A central plank in the reformers' strategy last year was to end the system
of open-ended credits from Russia to its former Soviet neighbours. They
achieved this aim in the last quarter of 1993, with credits tailing off in
October and stopping in November and December.
The agreement signed on Wednesday would wholly reverse these moves by
allowing the Central Bank of Belarus to issue roubles for its ailing and
unreformed economy, to have access to Russian gold and hard currency
reserves and to exchange roubles for hard currency at the Moscow currency
auctions.
A clause in the agreement, a copy of which has been obtained by the
Financial Times, says that 'the volume of cash emission on the territory of
Belarus shall be regulated by the National Bank of the Republic of Belarus'.
In exchange, Russia would gain control of the heavily industrialised Belarus
economy and extend its authority over the smallest of the three Slav states
which formed the core of the former Soviet Union. The third, Ukraine, is in
worse shape than Belarus - and pressure will rise there from the powerful
pro-union lobby for a similar deal.
The pressure will be greater since, according to Mr Valery Dashkevich, an
adviser to the Belarus Central Bank, 'Russia is ready to sell oil and gas to
Belarus at rates slightly lower than world prices, trying to bring them
closer to (Russian) domestic prices'.
Ukraine has been forced to pay full world prices for Russian energy, and is
suffering power cuts as a consequence.
Mr Andrei Illarionov, deputy director for the Russian Centre for Economic
Reformers, said last night that the move would immediately transfer
Rbs1,600bn from the Russian economy to that of Belarus. This was because the
agreed exchange rate between the Russian and the Belarus roubles was set at
1:1 - even though the Belarus currency is presently trading at five to one
Russian rouble.
Mr Illarionov blamed the move on Mr Viktor Gerashchenko, conservative
chairman of the Russian central bank who, he said, had been seeking to
destroy the strategy of ending credits to other states in pursuit of his
plan to try to re-create an economic union centred on Moscow.
A western economist for the Centre for Economic Reforms said: 'This would
completely destroy any hope of financial stability this year. At a stroke,
Russia has agreed to pay out the whole of the second tranche of the
International Monetary Fund's systemic transformation facility (Dollars
1.5bn) for which it will soon be negotiating.'

FT  07 JAN 94 / BT to cut call charges by 12%: Regulator forces reduction -
Customers to pay only for time used
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Telecommunications is to cut the average price of telephone calls by
more than 12 per cent this year, before inflation, after intervention by
Oftel, the telecommunications regulator.
Business and residential customers will save more than Pounds 800m from the
cuts in a full year.
The agreement was announced yesterday as BT unveiled tariff changes,
including an increase in line rental charges and abolition over the next two
years of the unit system of charging for calls.
At present, BT customers are charged for a full unit, which lasts for up to
three minutes and 40 seconds for off-peak local calls, even if they use only
a fraction of the time.
The planned move to charging by time elapsed - to the second - and a new
discount scheme for residential customers are BT's response to growing
competition from Mercury and cable television companies building networks in
urban areas.
Last month BT introduced a new, lower weekend tariff for long-distance
calls.
The price effect of the changes announced yesterday is neutral. But by the
end of July BT will have to make cuts worth Pounds 350m a year under its
existing price-cap agreement with Oftel.
Oftel is forcing BT to pass on the full value of next year's reductions from
November 1994, although the timing of the cuts will be left to BT. The
additional reductions will be equal to 7.5 per cent before inflation.
The action follows concern by Mr Don Cruickshank, Oftel director-general, at
BT's failure to make significant price cuts in recent months.
The increase in line rental charges, to take effect next month, will be
Pounds 1.01 for business customers and 73p for residential customers. The
increases take the quarterly rental to Pounds 32.66 for businesses and
Pounds 23.69 for residents, with Pounds 1 off for residents paying their
bills by direct debit.
BT will accompany the increases with a more generous low-user scheme for
residents making calls worth less than Pounds 10 a quarter. Some 3m
households will benefit, at an extra cost to BT of about Pounds 55m. BT
hopes that the scheme will boost phone ownership among the estimated 1m
households without a phone.
In a further move to stave off competition from Mercury, BT announced the
launch of a 'close ties' scheme, under which residential customers will get
a 5 per cent discount on five numbers of their choice, including one
overseas number, in return for a one-off payment of Pounds 4.99.
Mercury announced a similar scheme at the end of last year, to start in
March. Mercury's version, 'Yourcall', does not charge a registration fee
but, unlike BT's, is not available for local calls.
'Close ties' also reflects the influence of MCI, the US long-distance
carrier with which BT forged a Dollars 5.3bn (Pounds 3.6bn) alliance last
June. MCI pioneered a 'friends and family' tariff in the US.
Consumer groups criticised the rental increases, which are part of a
long-standing policy of raising rental charges to reduce the loss BT makes
on maintaining line connections.
But they and Mercury welcomed BT's decision to move to time-based tariffs.
Mr Terry Rhodes, Mercury's director of competition policy, said: 'Now for
the first time customers will be able to compare like with like; Mercury has
led the world by always charging by the second.'

FT  06 JAN 94 / International Company News: PacTel and Belgacom launch
Belgian mobile phone network
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Belgacom, Belgium's state-owned telephone company, and Pacific Telesis
International of the US, yesterday launched a mobile phone network for
Belgium and promised even closer co-operation.
The network, which started operating on January 1, is the fruit of a
five-month alliance, the first between a public European telephone operator
and a private cellular phone company. The launch strengthens another link in
the growing network of strategic alliances between telecoms groups in Europe
and the US.
PacTel, part of Pacific Telesis - one of the seven regional US telecoms
companies - said yesterday it would go on to build a formal joint venture
with Belgacom. PacTel will own 25 per cent of the subsidiary, and expects to
conclude a deal by the middle of this year.
Mr Jan Neels, PacTel International's president and chief executive, said the
subsidiary would be responsible for the digital 'GSM' mobile phone system
launched yesterday, and Belgium's existing analogue cellular network, which
could be phased out as clients switch to the Europe-wide GSM network.
'If there is an opportunity, which is a good fit for Belgacom and ourselves,
we could work together in other areas . . . in Belgium or outside Belgium,'
added Mr Neels, a Belgian citizen. He said the development of paging
services might be one such opportunity.
Mr Bessel Kok, Belgacom's chief executive, said the GSM system - Proximus -
had signed up more than 2,500 subscribers since January 1.
The European Commission is still examining Belgian legislation which
prevents a competitor entering the mobile phone market, which it believes
could be incompatible with European competition rules.
Mr Kok said the establishment of an efficient mobile phone subsidiary meant
Belgacom had met all three targets it set itself for 1993.
The group had also reduced the time taken to connect new customers, and
launched a new image, more in line with its growing autonomy from direct
government control.
The Belgian government has repeatedly indicated it wants to privatise part
of Belgacom, possibly as early as this year. But senior Belgacom executives
believe this may be too soon, given that restructuring is still under way,
and the group must prepare for full liberalisation of the European telecoms
market by 1998.
PacTel is itself being spun off from its parent company, which also owns the
California company Pacific Bell.

FT  06 JAN 94 / International Company News: VNU expects to beat forecast
with 12% rise

VNU, one of the Netherlands' top three publishing groups, expects to report
a 12 per cent increase in 1993 net profit before extraordinary items,
slightly better than its earlier forecast of 10 per cent growth.
In 1992 VNU reported net profit of Fl 128m (Dollars 66m) on normal
activities before taking an extraordinary charge of Fl 80m to cover the sale
of its printing operation in early 1993.
In August VNU had predicted a 10 per cent rise in 1993 net profit, in line
with results for the first half of the year.
Mr Joep Brentjens, chairman, described the performance as satisfying because
the company had raised profits and margins in spite of the unfavourable
economic climate. Final figures for 1993 will be released in the spring.
VNU said yesterday it posted substantially better results in consumer
magazines in the Netherlands; business magazine operations, which span six
European countries; business information services in the US; educational
publishing; and commercial television in Belgium and the Netherlands.
Robeco, the Dutch-based investment fund manager, said assets under
management rose by 42 per cent to a record Fl 65.8bn (Dollars 34bn) in 1993
from Fl 46.4bn in 1992.
The surge was due to an increase in the value of assets, reflecting buoyant
capital markets, and a 25 per cent rise in client base to 600,000 investors.
Robeco's strategic partnership with Rabobank, the Dutch co - operative bank,
yielded around Fl 5bn in new funds from investors seeking to compensate for
the decline in interest paid on savings accounts.
Robeco said all its investment funds showed 'excellent' results last year.
The group's flagship Robeco equity fund, which invests in shares around the
world, achieved a performance of 30.0 per cent in 1993, compared with 9.6
per cent in 1992.

FT  06 JAN 94 / Croats are warned they face economic sanctions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BELGRADE, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mrs Madeleine Albright, US ambassador to the United Nations, warned Croatia
yesterday that it could face international economic sanctions unless it
stayed out of the Bosnian war.
The warning, issued during a news conference in Zagreb, the Croat capital,
came as Moslem and Croatian negotiators in Vienna promised to make 'firm
efforts' to stop the war in central Bosnia at a top-level meeting in Bonn on
Saturday.
Mrs Albright said the US was 'very concerned' by the reported activities of
the Croatian military in support of Bosnian Croat forces. 'We have in a
number of ways warned the Croatian government and military specifically on
the subject,' she said.
Her statement followed statements by President Franjo Tudjman and his senior
officials that Zagreb might intervene directly to support Bosnian Croat
forces encircled by Moslem-led Bosnian troops in the central Lasva valley.
In spite of government denials, UN officers and Lord Owen, the European
Union's mediator on Yugoslavia, have claimed that Croatia has already given
military help against both Moslems and Serbs.
In an interview on Britain's Channel 4 television last night, Lord Owen said
the international community should react as strongly as it did to the
Serbian military intervention in Bosnia in 1992.
Mrs Albright's strictures coincided with harsh criticism of all the
participants in the Bosnian war from the Vatican, normally an unconditional
supporter of Roman Catholic Croatia.
'No individual, much less politicians, can resign themselves to allow people
to ravage each other and await a peace which would be the rotten fruit of
exhaustion, or the crushing of one side by the other,' a Vatican spokesman
said.
Meanwhile, the joint statement issued in Vienna by Mr Haris Silajdzic,
Bosnian prime minister, and Mr Mate Granic, Croatian foreign minister, said
their plan to halt hostilities would be put to their respective presidents
in Bonn on Saturday.
An agreement in Bonn is clearly a vital condition for progress at full-scale
negotiations, including the Serbs, due to take place in Geneva on January
18.
In Paris, the defence ministry said France was asking the US to help in two
proposed operations in Bosnia to relieve Serb pressure on Moslem enclaves.
It wanted air power and logistical support to lift the Serbian blockade of
Tuzla airfield in northern Bosnia and allow a Danish armoured column to
relieve the besieged town of Srebrenica.

FT  06 JAN 94 / France launches newly independent central bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING and ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The French government yesterday completed the final stage of its creation of
an independent central bank, appointing a nine-member council which will
have autonomy in the conduct of monetary policy and the determination of
interest rates.
Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister, described the establishment of
the Bank of France's monetary policy council as 'an historic step'. He said
the bank would be as independent as the Bundesbank in the formulation of
monetary policy.
The reform, according to Mr Alphandery, should strengthen the credibility of
anti-inflationary policies and brings France into line with the requirements
of the Maastricht treaty on European Union. Under the treaty, member
countries must establish independent monetary authorities as part of the
second phase of monetary union. The nine-member council will be headed by Mr
Jean-Claude Trichet, the governor of the Bank of France, and his two
deputies, Mr Herve Hannoun and Mr Denis Ferman.
The six lay members, described by Mr Alphandery as 'respected and
representative', are drawn from a range of occupations from journalism to
industry. They include Mr Michel Albert, chairman of Assurances Generales de
France (AGF), the state-owned insurance group, and Mr Michel Sapin, the
former socialist finance minister.
The six lay members have nine-year terms, while the Bank of France officials
have six-year terms. Economists and bankers in Paris said they did not
expect any substantial changes in the conduct of monetary policy.
'Mr Trichet and other influential members of the council support the present
policy of gradually reducing interest rates, while maintaining the stability
of the currency,' said one currency analyst. The newly independent central
bank does, however, have some room to ease borrowing costs.
The return of the French franc to the narrow European exchange rate bands,
from which it was forced following last summer's currency crisis, could
allow a reduction in the intervention rate, the floor for money market
rates, from its current level of 6.2 per cent.
Council members must give up their full-time jobs, a condition which creates
a need for a replacement for Mr Albert at AGF. His departure for the
monetary policy council creates a vacuum at the top of the country's third
largest insurance group at a time when it is preparing for privatisation.

FT  06 JAN 94 / US warns Japan against relying on a weaker yen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US yesterday renewed its call for the Japanese government to stimulate
the country's economy, and warned it not to hope for a weaker yen to pull it
out of recession.
Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US Treasury secretary, said Japan still had a huge
trade surplus and could not look to the US and other countries to make up
for slack domestic demand.
'Allowing the yen to slide is not an acceptable way out of recession for
Japan,' Mr Bentsen said in a speech yesterday at the Brookings Institution,
a Washington think-tank.
Although foreign exchange traders had been waiting for Mr Bentsen's speech,
the yen strengthened only modestly on his remarks.
Mr Bentsen said he wanted to see economic policies that would stimulate
demand in Japan and help Japanese consumers. 'I think if they do that the
yen will reflect it,' he added.
Presenting an overview of the Clinton administration's economic policies, Mr
Bentsen expressed confidence that the steps already taken to reduce the US
federal budget deficit would bring more economic good news in 1994.
Growth had accelerated steadily throughout 1993 and should reach between 4
and 5 per cent in the fourth quarter, he said, while the inflation rate of
2.8 per cent was as low as it had been for years.
'This year I'd like to see us achieve a solid 3 per cent real growth - and
hold inflation to approximately 3 per cent. That should allow interest rates
to remain relatively low and reduce further the unemployment rate,' Mr
Bentsen said.
Noting that, like millions of US homeowners, he had refinanced his mortgage
last year to take advantage of lower interest rates, Mr Bentsen said he had
selected an adjustable rate mortgage, 'which means I'm optimistic about
what's going to happen to interest rates'.
Although he said the budget deficit for the 1995 fiscal year, starting
October 1, would be only about Dollars 190bn, much lower than the
administration had earlier forecast, he warned that the budget would be very
tight.

FT  06 JAN 94 / Kravchuk faces Clinton squeeze

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton will not meet President Leonid Kravchuk of Ukraine
during his visit to Moscow next week unless significant progress has been
made on US demands that Ukraine honour its promises to give up the nuclear
weapons based on its territory.
Although talks between the US, Russia and Ukraine on the nuclear missile
issue have accelerated in recent days, White House and State Department
officials have been much more cautious about the prospects for reaching
agreement than have their Ukrainian counterparts.
In Kiev, Ukrainian officials have been reported as saying that Mr Kravchuk
had already been invited to Moscow by President Boris Yeltsin.
US officials, who have been meeting this week in Washington with Mr Valery
Shmarov, the Ukrainian deputy foreign minister, insisted nevertheless that a
deal of such importance could not be rushed through just to fit in with the
Moscow summit.
'My understanding is the meeting will occur if President Kravchuk is
prepared to sign on behalf of Ukraine the non-proliferation treaty;
likewise, the pledge that all the SS-19 and SS-24 missiles will, in fact, be
dismantled and the warheads shipped back for destruction in Russia,' Senator
Richard Lugar, who is visiting Moscow, said yesterday.
Although Ukraine made these promises in 1991, it has not lived up to them.
It has found that it tends to be taken more seriously both as a foreign
policy voice and as a recipient of economic aid while it still holds nuclear
weapons on its territory.
US Defence Secretary Les Aspin, yesterday spoke to Russian Defence Minister
Pavel Grachev on a new hotline, Reuter adds.
The hotline talk was another step in warming relations between the former
cold war superpower foes. The US and Russian militaries will hold a joint
exercise next summer.
The direct telephone link between the offices of the defence leaders is an
addition to existing hotlines linking the US and Russian presidents and a
teletype connection between military 'war rooms' in Washington and Moscow.

Admiral Charles Larson is due to arrive in Hanoi on January 16 for a

The visit coincides with the stepped-up debate in the US on whether Hanoi's

Russian monthly inflation slowed to 12 per cent in December, the lowest
level for the whole of last year after strenuous efforts by the finance
ministry to cut spending wherever it could and restrain the country's habit
of printing money to finance the budget deficit, writes Leyla Boulton.
This brought annual inflation to about 900 per cent in 1993 from 2,500 per
cent in 1992. The monthly rate for December compared to 15 per cent in
November and 20 per cent in October.

FT  06 JAN 94 / Germany to press EU on telecoms
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Germany will press for an end-of-decade deadline for the liberalisation of
telecommunications infrastructure across the European Union when it assumes
the EU's presidency in July, write Andrew Adonis and Ariane Genillard.
Mr Wolfgang Botsch, German telecommunications minister, said yesterday that
Germany wanted to see liberalisation take place two years after competition
is introduced in basic voice services, which will take place in 1998 in most
EU states. The 1998 deadline will allow telecom operators to provide rival
services across each other's networks. However, existing EU policy does not
extend to allowing competitors to build their own infrastructure.
The European Commission is due to publish a policy statement on
telecommunications infrastructure early next year. But the Greek socialist
government, which holds the EU presidency, is unenthusiastic about
liberalisation, and little progress is likely to be made until Germany
succeeds in July.
The UK is currently the only EU state to allow full infrastructure
competition.
However, the Netherlands is likely to allow a consortium of utilities and
others to build a second network to compete with the state operator when it
is partially privatised this year. Infrastructure competition is also
permitted in some Scandinavian countries.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Union's attempt to end passport controls at internal borders
has been 'a catalogue of broken promises', according to a Europe-wide
citizens' lobby group.
Euro Citizen Action Service (Ecas) yesterday condemned the European
Commission and EU member states for failing to abolish checks at internal
borders, a year after the original deadline of January 1, 1993.
Since then, the nine members of the Schengen free-travel zone - all EU
countries except Britain, Denmark and Ireland - have set and missed two
further deadlines and are now aiming to abolish passport checks on February
1.
But Mr Tony Venables, who heads Ecas, yesterday cast doubt on the countries'
ability to meet the new deadline. Schengen officials admitted yesterday they
could not guarantee that a new computer system, linking national immigration
and police authorities, would be in place in time.
'What we are protesting about is that nothing really changed after January
(1993): the same habit of systematic bureaucratic controls continues
everywhere, especially at borders,' Mr Venables told a press conference
yesterday.
Ecas yesterday launched a new telephone 'hotline'*, which will allow
European citizens to complain about problems with border controls after
February 1. Ecas received more than 700 calls, letters and fax messages
about border controls when it ran a similar hotline last January. The
European parliament has already lodged a complaint against the Commission
with the European court, accusing Brussels of failing to enforce EU rules on
free movement of people. Ecas yesterday threatened to open a second case.
Siemens and Bull, the German and French electronics groups, have been
working on the Schengen computer system for two years, but they have yet to
iron out all the software problems. Schengen experts will meet in Brussels
on January 25 to decide whether the February 1 deadline can be met. Ecas and
the parliament then want Brussels to take tough action to force Britain,
Denmark and Ireland to abolish their passport checks.

FT  06 JAN 94 / Jobless in West Germany up to 2.5m: Industrial orders fall
as unemployment rate rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARIANE GENILLARD and CHRISTOPHER PARKES

<TEXT>
West Germany's unemployment rate in December rose to its highest level since
reunification four years ago, overshooting government estimates and damping
hopes for economic recovery in 1994.
More than 2.5m were registered without jobs in the western part of the
country in December, bringing the unadjusted unemployment rate to 8.1 per
cent, according to figures released by the Federal Labour Office yesterday.
This compares with 2.4m in November and an unemployment rate of 7.8 per
cent.
The high unemployment rate was announced as industrial orders for November
continued to show weak domestic demand. Orders in Germany fell by 0.5 per
cent against October, while orders from abroad dropped by 1.5 per cent,
according to the economics ministry.
In light of the continuing recession, Mr Hans-Jurgen Koebnik, a member of
the Bundesbank decision-making central council, said yesterday that the
central bank's policymakers believed Germany's short-term interest rates
were too high.
The 5.75 per cent discount rate and the 6.75 per cent Lombard rate,
unchanged since October 22, would fall during the course of the year
provided conditions were right, he said. Mr Koebnik, president of the
central bank of Saarland and Rhineland-Palatinate, said the inflation rate
was an especially important factor.
His remarks match the opinions of most independent economists, but contrast
with the approach traditional among Germany's central bankers.
Mr Bernhard Jagoda, president of the federal labour office, said the
unemployment figures were 'largely attributable to seasonal fluctuations'.
Still, on an adjusted basis the number of unemployed west Germans rose to
2.494m in December from 2.489m in November. In total, 675,000 people lost
jobs in western Germany for the whole year.
In the autumn, a government forecast said the west German unemployment rate
would reach 7.5 per cent by the end of 1993. But unemployment is expected to
climb to 10 per cent next year, according to revised government projections
published late last month.
Economists have been warning that unemployment could continue to rise as
short-time workers are made redundant. Since the beginning of the year, the
number of short-time workers, who have part of their salary covered by the
federal labour office, has nearly halved.
In eastern Germany, unemployment could continue to rise as places on
retraining schemes are reduced. Eastern Germany's unemployment rate rose to
15.4 per cent in December from 15.1 per cent the previous month.

FT  06 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Focus switches to the FT-SE Mid 250
stocks - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The managers of the big investment funds took a hard look at their
pre-Christmas profits yesterday and began to reshape their portfolios, often
moving out of blue chips and into second line issues. Their endeavours
brought contrasting performances by market indices: the FT-SE 100-share
Index abandoned the 3,400 mark to close nearly 30 points off, while the
FT-SE Mid 250 Index, covering a wider range of stocks, jumped a further 21
points to a new high of 3,820.4.
The process of repositioning was hurried along by another reversal of
fortunes in the March Footsie fut-ure, which was sold off in the second half
of the session, and by fresh losses in UK government bonds.
Trading volume was heavy, and yesterday's Seaq total of 907.7m shares traded
was spared the distortions of the previous day when just in excess of 1bn
shares passed through the electronic system; nearly 70 per cent of
yesterday's trade was in non-Footsie stocks. Tuesday's retail trade in
equities was worth Pounds 1.47bn, well up to the high levels recorded in the
London market before Christmas.
At the final reading the FT-SE 100 was 29.3 off at 3,379.2. UK equities had
opened hopefully, responding to a better performance from Wall Street
overnight than had been expected in view of the concerns that US interest
rates might be about to move higher. But after breaking through the 3,400
mark with a gain of 10.9 at 3,419.4, the market ran into a determined seller
of stock index futures, on which the premium against the underlying index
was quickly replaced by a discount.
The institutions showed themselves very selective in trading activity, and
concentrated on specific areas of the market. Media stocks continued to
attract significant support as investors assessed the implications of the UK
government's proposed review of cross media ownership. But the
pharmaceuticals sector suffered heavily following reports of proposed
changes in Italian health care.
Some Channel ferry operators fell as the shipowners began to respond to
reports of Eurotunnel's fares plans. And UK retail stores, still nervously
awaiting details of the Christmas selling season, were sold down.
The final picture of the Footsie stocks was more mixed than the fall in the
index suggested. Oil shares steadied on hints that the Opec ministers may
meet again this month and attempt to stabilise crude prices. Insurance
stocks attracted support but shares in the leading banks, which led the
market last month, eased back ahead of their profits reporting season; the
exception was TSB.
The London market tried to rally in mid-afternoon but found further cause
for discouragement when Wall Street and other European markets looked
hesitant. The close was the low point of the day, and equity traders feared
that the weakness which has characterised UK stocks since the return from
the new year break could well continue for a while.
Some sources looked for a move on German interest rates at today's meeting
of the Bundesbank council. But the hopes for a cut in UK base rates, which
helped to drive the stock market to new highs before Christmas, have waned
somewhat on fears that they may be held back until the spring, when the
Budget tax rises will begin to hit consumers and the economy.

FT  06 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: TV stocks busy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Television stocks were once again among the day's best performers as James
Capel turned more positive on the sector as a whole.
The agency broker urged investors to 'go overweight' from its previous 'in
line' advice, its favourite stock being Carlton Communications. The shares
finished 12 ahead at 959p, after touching 964p, and 2.4m were traded.
The recommendation from James Capel gave a further boost to a sector buoyed
by bid speculation following news of a wide ranging review of UK cross-media
ownership. A further advance was seen in LWT, up 20 at 626p, after the
company said it was still in merger talks with Yorkshire-Tyne Tees TV, 18
ahead at 192p.
But it was a strong recommendation from UBS that sent Granada up 18 to a
record 539p on volume of 6.1m. Anglia, another potential takeover candidate,
put on 8 at 441p.
Among publishing stocks, James Capel also favours United Newspapers and the
shares gained 22 at 676p.
Legal &amp; General advanced 6 to 511p after Strauss Turnbull turned buyer of
the stock. Analysts at the broking house said it had been oversold in recent
sessions. Strauss also advised investors to switch out of Guardian Royal
Exchange and into Commercial Union. The former shed 2 to 228p, while the
latter firmed 2 to 647p.
The onset of a ferry price war ahead of the opening of the Channel tunnel
later this year weakened P&amp;O, one of the main ferry operators across the
channel. The shares retreated 19 to 619p.
Channel tunnel operator Eurotunnel remained in demand following Tuesday's
funding agreement with the group's bankers. The shares gained a further 14
to 644p, with the stock once again reported to have been heavily traded in
Paris, where it is also listed.
Profit-takers moved into the stores sector, although some second liners were
in demand on the talk of good Christmas sales. Allders jumped 14 to 218p,
with encouraging trade reports from John Lewis and House of Fraser said to
have underpinned support. Luxury goods group Vendome gained 8 at 394p and
Sears edged up 1 1/2 to 126 1/2 p. Moss Bros climbed 17 to 260p. WH Smith
'A' ran out of steam and slipped 3 1/2 to 514p, but reports of strong book
sales again lifted Pentos, up 2 at 29p. Among jewellery groups, Signet added
1 1/2 at 27 3/4 p and Goldsmiths put on 3 at 91p. Among the majors, Boots
slid 6 to 587p, Great Universal Stores 8 to 637p, Kingfisher 10 to 762p and
Dixons 4 to 283p.
A hefty note from Kleinwort Benson on pub operators brought interest to an
otherwise muted drinks sector. The broker advised selling Boddington, off 5
at 280p, because of the shares' big premium to asset value and the likely
sale of the near 20 per cent stake held by Whitbread. It was also negative
on Vaux, down 3 at 269p, which it considers fully valued. Greene King, up 2
at 553p, survived the broker's bearish remarks. Bass rose 7 to 548p, with SG
Warburg said to be positive.
There was another day's busy trading in Ladbroke, although the large gains
made on Tuesday were reigned in and the shares ended just 2 higher at 177p.
Turnover reached 10m. Thorn EMI jumped 21 to a record 1011p in volume of
2.6m, dealers attributing the rise to con-tinued talk of takeover in the
multimedia market.
A clutch of brokers' recommendations following Tuesday's announcement by
Williams Holdings that it was buying a US commercial locks manufacturer
boosted the group's shares. They jumped 14 to 391p on 2.2m dealt. The list
of brokers recommending the shares included Robert Fleming and NatWest
Securities.
International mining group RTZ surrendered most of Tuesday's rise as brokers
advised investors to 'take profits'. The shares receded 10 to 834p.
A firm gold price coupled with favourable comment lifted international
trading group Lonrho 6 to 140p. Also benefiting from the higher gold price
was Monarch Resources, 9 up at 236p.
Among aerospace and engineering stocks, Westland Group advanced 9 to 265p on
news that it had won a Pounds 150m helicopter order from Brazil. Henderson
Crosthwaite was reported to have acted for the day's big buyer of
Rolls-Royce. The shares put on 5 to 168p in active trading of 8.5m.
In motors, investors turned their attention to GKN, one of last year's
underperforming stocks, with some talk of the possibility of an improvement
in the group's European markets this year. The shares forged ahead 22 to
547p, while Laird Group advanced 11 to 356p in sympathy.

FT  06 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Sellers hit drugs sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Selected pharmaceutical stocks were driven lower as worries grew over the
impact of new regulations in the Italian prescription drugs market.
SmithKline Beecham was the worst hit, the shares retreating 15 to 391p.
Analysts said the group's Pounds 250m a year sales in Italy could be reduced
by as much as 30 per cent under the new rules. Three SmithKline drugs -
Argmentin, Refen and Seroxat - could be reclassified under the regulations
omitting them from receiving state reimbursements for customer
prescriptions. However, the drugs companies plan to appeal against the new
regulations.
Glaxo, which tumbled 23 to 693p, was further undermined by a negative note
from Goldman Sachs, which reaffirmed its view that over the long term the
stock will underperform. The broker is concerned that the ending of patent
rights for Tagamet - owned by SmithKline Beecham - in 1994 may bring lower
usage of Zantac, the Glaxo-owned rival in the ulcer market, as cheaper
alternatives to Tagamet become available.
A significant proportion of US health care managers responding to a Goldman
Sach's survey indicated that they were likely to use less Zantac when
generic Tagamet becomes available. However, a more positive Mr Nigel Barnes
at Hoare Govett said: 'The impact of generic Tagamet has been exaggerated
and the therapeutic differences between Zantac and Tagamet underestimated.
The choice of product is more than just price alone.'
Elsewhere, Wellcome staged a recovery, the shares gaining 5 at 665p, with
Salomon Brothers issuing a buy note. The broker argued that the shares had
been oversold and said that even on the most pessimistic assumptions
compound annual earnings per share growth of 12 per cent can be expected
over the next four years.

FT  06 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stock index futures yesterday had rather less influence over underlying
share prices than on the previous session, but suffered a further bout of
selling pressure, writes Terry Byland.
As in previous sessions, the trend was somewhat erratic, but the March
contract on the FT-SE 100 Index was finally dominated by a single determined
seller.
The first few hours of trading went well, with the March contract at a
premium of around 20 points to cash, against a fair value premium estimated
at around 13 points. This provided opportunities for arbitraging, when the
futures can be bought and the underlying shares sold.
But such operations were soon driven out of court when the seller of the
contract emerged in the mid-morning. The contract fell off and was briefly
at a discount to the cash market.
In spite of attempted rallies, March closed at the low of the day to show a
premium of only 9 points to the Footsie index itself, and therefore a
discount of around four points to fair value. Volume was fairly high at
15,761 lots, and the contract continued to ease in later trading.
Traded options had a busy session, recording 63,977 contracts traded,
against 40,740 previously. Mirroring the stock market, the FT-SE contract
saw turnover dip to 14,165 from Tuesday's 18,658. The Euro FT-SE contract
reported 10,948 deals.
Among individual stock options, brokerage recommendations continued to
provide the driving force. Both Fisons (1,760 lots) and Ladbroke (1,565)
benefited under this score. Land Securities (6,183) headed the list.

</HEADLINE>

Mexican stocks rallied sharply to end the session almost 100 points higher,
driven by widespread perceptions that the government has the uprising in
Chiapas under control. The IPC index, after a late rebound on Tuesday, rose
98.42, or 3.85 per cent, to a record 2,657.31.
Brazilian shares closed 5 per cent ahead but below the day's best after
gains were trimmed by late selling on reports that a powerful faction of the
centrist PMDB, Brazil's largest political party, could withdraw its support
from the government. The Bovespa index ended at 42,105, up 2,100, after
touching 43,565.

FT  06 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Cyclical issues lead Dow to
record level
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Wall Street
US stocks, led by cyclical issues, climbed to record levels yesterday
afternoon after investors put aside their initial uneasiness about sagging
bond prices, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
By the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 14.92 ahead at 3,798.82,
compared with the previous high of 3,794.33. But the Standard &amp; Poor's 500
gained only 0.66 at 467.55. The American SE composite firmed 1.43 to 478.79
and the Nasdaq composite rose 3.77 to 778.05. NYSE volume was a very heavy
400m shares.
The advance by blue chips did not come easy. In early trading, concern over
higher interest rates again overshadowed hopes that a strong economy would
boost corporate profits. Strength in manufacturing was again documented by
the Commerce Department, which reported factory orders in November had risen
1.4 per cent, against a consensus forecast of 1.3 per cent.
The robust data, combined with a sharp rise in crude oil prices, assured the
demise of a late rally in bonds seen in the previous session. Inflationary
concerns resurfaced and the 30-year government security had shed  3/4 to 97
5/8 by 4pm.
In spite of the concern over interest rates, stocks most likely to be
rewarded by sustained growth showed steady improvement, pulling the blue
chip barometer into positive territory by late afternoon.
Paper and pulp stocks were strong. International Paper rose Dollars 2 5/8 to
Dollars 72 1/4 and Georgia Pacific Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 72 1/4 . Federal
Paperboard added Dollars 2 3/8 at Dollars 24 3/4 and Boise Cascade Dollars 1
1/2 at Dollars 25 1/8 on 'buy' recommendations from Oppenheimer.
Some oil issues improved on news of higher crude prices. Arco put on Dollars
2 1/8 at Dollars 108 5/8 and Amerada Hess Dollars 1 3/4 at Dollars 48 3/4 .
Borden dropped Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 16 after its board approved a
sweeping restructuring plan, which includes the disposal of several
businesses and a Dollars 650m charge against fourth-quarter earnings.
Merck, the most active NYSE issue, advanced Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 37 3/8
the day after announcing a reorganisation and naming an heir-apparent to its
chairman, Mr P. Roy Vagelos.
The Baby Bell regional telephone groups suffered in the wake of MCI's
decision to compete directly with them. Southwestern Bell was down Dollars 1
3/4 to Dollars 38 7/8 and USWest Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 43 3/4 . Canada
Toronto surged to a record high for a second consecutive session on a solid
rise in transport and industrial products shares. The TSE 300 index climbed
32.5 to 4,401.1 and volume was an extremely brisk 98.2m shares valued at
CDollars 990m.

institutional investors and other financial institutions polled by Kleiman
International Consultants.
The dollar allocation grew by an average of 75 per cent and a further 30 per
cent increase is forecast for this figure in the coming year. The increases,
says Kleiman, reflect the growing acceptance of emerging markets by clients
of the US-based consultancy, polled for a five year review of developments
in the field.
A broader geographic diversification was accompanied by a regional shift in
allocations. This is attributed to a number of factors: the opening of new
markets such as Zimbabwe and Jordan to foreign investment, strong
performance in emerging markets and efforts to diversify portfolios. In
1990, only 7 per cent of respondents had holdings in Africa and/or the
Middle East but the figure had grown to 50 per cent by 1993. Similarly,
central and southern European markets were in 85 per cent of portfolios in
1993, compared with two-thirds in 1990.
Africa's 14 existing stock markets, and new ones opening in Zambia and
Tanzania, are expected to benefit from further portfolio diversification in
the coming year. While many European and Japanese institutions re-entered
South Africa after Mr Nelson Mandela was released from prison, US investors
only began to re-explore opportunities in the final quarter of last year.
The renewed attention paid to South Africa is expected to spill over to
smaller, less liquid markets in the continent, including Morocco and Tunisia
in the north and the southern markets of Botswana, Ghana, Namibia,
Swaziland, Zambia and Zimbabwe.

FT  06 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Corrections, new highs
in region as Nikkei adds 2.4%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Buying by arbitrageurs and foreign investors boosted share prices on the
first full-day session for the year, and the Nikkei average closed 2.4 per
cent up, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue index gained 413.74 at 17,783.48, while the Topix index of all
first section stocks rose 16.88, or 1.2 per cent, to 1,462.85. In London the
ISE/Nikkei 50 index was 3.16 higher at 1,213.54.
The Nikkei opened at the day's low of 17,376.54 and advanced steadily on
arbitrage linked buying in tandem with a rise in the futures market. After a
brief lull in the afternoon, further demand from overseas investors and
investment trusts pushed the benchmark to a day's high of 17,793.18 just
before the close.
Volume amounted to 293m shares, after Tuesday's half-day session total of
118m. Rises overwhelmed declines by 818 to 181, with 112 issues unchanged.
Financial institutions were seen selling, and traders expected profit-taking
to increase as the index approaches the 18,000 level. However, strong buying
of blue chip issues by foreign investors supported prices. 'Many foreigners
think that other overseas markets are becoming too high, and are increasing
their allocation in Japanese shares,' said a Japanese trader.
Prospects of rationalisation and the lower yen continued to lift export
orientated, high-technology stocks. Fujitsu, the most active issue of the
day, climbed Y12 to Y866. Sony added Y220 at Y5,840 on foreign buying.
Automakers were also strong, with Isuzu Motors up Y26 to Y395 and Honda
Motor gaining Y60 at Y1,630.
Ajinomoto, a leading food manufacturer, moved ahead Y140 to Y1,340 on
reports of its anti-Aids vaccine development project. Other drug and
bio-technology issues were higher, with Dainippon Pharmaceutical rising Y44
to Y1,040.
Stronger gold prices pushed up Sumitomo Metal Mining by Y5 to Y924. Hanwa, a
steel trader which was sold heavily last month on speculation of financial
problems, rebounded Y72 to Y535 on short-covering.
Hopes of growing demand for car navigation systems left Pioneer Electronic
Y70 stronger at Y2,910.
The day's losers included banks. Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank lost Y10 to Y1,790 and
Mitsubishi Bank Y10 to Y2,620 on profit-taking. Real estate companies were
weak. Mitsubishi Estate shed Y7 to Y913.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 320.65 to 19,591.76 in volume of 19.4m
shares.
Roundup
The region mixed yet more highs in some markets with corrections in others.
TAIWAN posted one of its biggest percentage gains in years, opening 1994
with a 5.7 per cent rise to a 42-month high. The weighted index closed
346.28 ahead at 6,416.84 as turnover soared to TDollars 145bn, the heaviest
since June 1990.
Dealers and speculators celebrated the start of same-day trading, allowing
sales of stocks bought earlier in the same day, although professionals said
the move increased chances that the market would hit bouts of heavy
profit-taking.
The market ignored the Finance Ministry's proposal to reimpose a stock
capital gains tax.
SEOUL was a study in contrasts. The stock index hit a new peak, 9.63 higher
at 886.93, as foreign investors continued to support financials and shares
with low price-to-book ratios.
However, brokers said the market was due to consolidate on selling pressure
from the Korea Stock Market Stabilisation Fund, and three trusts which are
subject to pay back Won2,600bn in soft loans to the central bank by February
10.
KUALA LUMPUR took profits and fell from a fresh record high of 1,332.04, but
the composite index still managed to end at a new closing peak of 1,314.46,
up 1.11.
JAKARTA broke through the 600 barrier for the first time in nearly four
years, the JKSE index finishing 12.95 stronger at 612.89. Volume was boosted
by block deals in Bank International Indonesia of 9.5m shares at Rp8,300.
KARACHI gave credit for its record high to institutions, and foreign buyers
looking for undervalued shares. The KSE index rose 20.13 to 2,274.02.
AUSTRALIA registered yet another post-1987 record on demand for resource
stocks and a soaring futures market. The All Ordinaries index closed 19.1 up
at 2,193.4, the March Share Price index gained 36 at 2,241, and surging
mining and gold stocks pushed the All Resources index ahead 30.9 to 1,356.6.
Oil shares benefited from rising crude prices. Woodside put on 9 cents at
ADollars 4.32, Santos 7 cents at ADollars 3.94 and Ampolex 29 cents at
ADollars 5.97. Turnover was ADollars 744.91m.
HONG KONG saw profit-taking snap a string of four consecutive rises,
although the Hang Seng index closed a mere 33.16 easier at 12,167.93 after
trading in a 250-point band. Turnover was the second highest ever at a
provisional HKDollars 13.14bn, down from Tuesday's record HKDollars 15.1bn.
SINGAPORE called it a correction as the Straits Times Industrial index fell
39.91, or 1.6 per cent, to 2,431.99 after hitting an intraday all-time high
of 2,482.91.
BANGKOK saw record turnover of Bt40bn as investors took profits, and the SET
index retrreated 44.09, or 2.5 per cent, to 1,709.64.

FT  06 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Akzo the star performer as
Amsterdam peaks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Subdued again in Frankfurt and Paris, the continent still managed to produce
a string of new highs yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
AMSTERDAM overcame mid-session profit-taking in a late rebound which
restored prices to record levels and the AEX index closed 1.51 higher at
422.40.
Akzo was the star performer, rising Fl 9 or 4.7 per cent to Fl 200.00 after
a company presentation confirmed analysts' positive expectations of the
group's acquisition of Nobel's core chemical businesses.
Hoogovens, the steel group, continued its recent run, setting a 12-month
intra-day high of Fl 54.00 before closing Fl 1.80 firmer at Fl 53.70.
Elsevier fell Fl 3.20 to Fl 185.00, erasing Tuesday's gain which followed a
a report that the US Paramount group had once tried to acquire a stake in
the publisher.
ZURICH moved ahead in spite of profit-taking during the afternoon and the
SMI index added 7.9 to another record close of 3,007.1.
The biggest gains were seen among cyclicals with Sulzer adding SFr35 or 4.1
per cent to SFr880, helped by a warrant issue and its inclusion as a
constituent of the SMI index since January 1.
Ascom shed SFr80 or 5.5 per cent to SFr1,365 after a local newspaper report
that the troubled telecommunications group had lost a semi-exclusive
contract with the Swiss PTT. A statement from Ascom that it had just signed
a new contract came after the bourse closed.
Adia added SFr15 to SFr208 after a report that chart analysis indicted a
forthcoming upturn in the price.
FRANKFURT featured relative weakness in banks as the Dax index fell 20.17 to
2,233.41 on the session, and another 9.80 to 2,223.61 in the post bourse.
Commerzbank fell DM12.50, or more than 3 per cent to DM385 and Bayernverien
DM12.50 to DM565. Analysts said that attention might be moving from banking
profits, very high in 1993, to the current level of provisions, and that
Commerzbank had been relatively strong lately ahead of its rights issue.
Turnover fell from DM11.9bn to DM10.8bn. Laggards continued to attract
attention, with construction stocks joined yesterday by steels, where
Klockner-Werke rose DM4.60 to DM112.50 and Preussag by DM8 to DM459.50.
PARIS took profits in a big way, turnover climbing from FFr4.5bn to
FFr6.03bn as the CAC-40 index fell 24.79 to 2,249.55.
Peugeot fell FFr16 to FFr761 after Tuesday's car industry figures which
showed that sales fell last year to their lowest since 1975.
Among recently strong performers, Societe Generale came back FFr21 to FFr745
but Eurotunnel continued the run of strength on its tariff announcement and
last week's extension of its concession to operate the Channel tunnel,
rising another FFr1.60 to FFr57.10.
MILAN slid 1.4 per cent in an overdue correction for a politically
apprehensive market. The Comit index shed 8.82 to 611.50.
Industrial stocks suffered the heaviest losses with Fiat L167 lower at
L4,215 and Olivetti down L77 to L2,008. Montedison was again the most
heavily traded, losing L35 to L894 in volume of 34.7m shares, amid heavy
arbitrage between the ordinary stock and the rights.
A L154 or 8.4 per cent fall to L1,676 in Ferruzzi was also attributed to
arbitrage between its ordinary and rights shares.
MADRID was rescued by late buying after a bruising day, the general index
easing 0.39 to 324.22 in turnover of Pta27.4bn.
In mixed to lower banks, still depressed by the Banesto situation, Santander
fell Pta150 to Pta6,450. The search for laggards seemed evident here, too,
with Tabacalera up Pta110 to Pta4,105 on the day.
BRUSSELS saw a new record close, 9.09 higher at 1,484.97 in high turnover of
BFr1.78bn.
Gains were spread among cyclicals, financials and retailers. Cockerill, the
steelmaker, rose BFr5 to BFr160 and Recticel (polyurethane foam) by BFr36 to
BFr636, exemplifying the European tendency to look for laggard stocks.
Retailers mostly advanced ahead of pending results, Delhaize rising BFr20 to
BFr1,370.
STOCKHOLM shares ended mixed although the the Affarsvarlden index rose 7.7
to 1,438.8, posting a third consecutive record high.
OSLO hit another new high, spurred by stronger prices for Norway's North Sea
oil. The all-share index closed 6.11 higher at 636.99 in turnover up from
NKr933m to NKr1.13bn.
DUBLIN's ISEQ overall index rose another 24.97, or 1.3 per cent to another
new high of 1,933.07 as analysts looked for a first quarter market gain of
10 to 15 per cent.
ATHENS accelerated its rate of climb again, the general index closing 25.18,
or 2.5 per cent higher at 1,019.39 in very heavy trading. Turnover was
estimated at about Dr10bn, the highest in the last two years.

FT  06 JAN 94 / Markets Report: Bentsen checks Dollars-yen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Officials' statements, rather than government statistics, dominated trading
on money markets yesterday in the absence of significant fresh economic
data, writes Gillian Tett.
A speech from Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US Treasury secretary, deploring the yen's
slide, focused market attention around the politically sensitive yen-dollar
rate. But, with the Bundesbank council meeting today, the possibility of
German interest rate cuts continued to undermine the D-Mark's ailing
fortunes.
Following recent rapid dollar gains, the yen staged a small recovery
yesterday after Mr Bentsen's carefully timed intervention. Speaking in
Washington, Mr Bentsen said that 'allowing the yen to slide' was not 'an
acceptable way out of recession for Japan'.
His comments pushed the dollar briefly down to Y112.2, from Tuesday's close
of Y113.2. However, it later rallied, closing in London at Y112.8. In New
York it ended at Y113.02.
The yen's failure to sustain its initial surge against the dollar was not
unexpected, dealers said. The dollar's resilience at Y112.1 suggested that
the US currency remained well supported, they added.
'The yen had a knee jerk reaction, But since then it is looking a bit
softer,' explained Mr Stephen King, deputy chief economist of James Capel.
Since the Japanese trade surplus was already declining, Mr Bentsen's
comments would not have the same impact as his similar intervention last
year, he noted.
But, as Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank, pointed out, the US
and Japanese governments still faced difficult decisions.
Although the appreciation of the yen was central to US policy last year, the
severity of the recession in Japan is likely to demand a further weakening
of the yen - Mr MacKinnon himself, using OECD figures, calculates that
without new fiscal policies the yen will need to depreciate to Y130 against
the dollar in coming months before there could be any 'kickstarting' of the
Japanese economy.
The fact that the market is currently underweight in yen might provide a
small corrective factor. But the Japanese government's failure to implement
any fresh fiscal policies is likely to remain a major source of concern on
the currency markets. The US now appears to be trying to put pressure on
Japan 'to get their act together' on fresh fiscal policies, he said.
Amid market speculation about the likelihood of German rate cuts today, a
comment from Mr Hans-Juergen Koebnick, a member of the Bundesbank central
council, criticising the high level of German rates was a key factor
influencing trade in the dollar against the D-Mark. Speaking on German
radio, Mr Koebnik said a 'significant' fall in German rates was likely this
year.
The comments pushed the dollar up against the D-Mark, cancelling out an
early loss. It ended at DM1.7399, little changed from the previous day. It
finished New York trading at DM1.7400.
With the German economy faltering, the D-Mark is expected to remain weak
irrespective of whether the Bundesbank cuts rates today. Although West
German unemployment figures for December published yesterday were marginally
above expectations, worse than expected industry order data, showing a 0.8
per cent fall in orders in November, again underlined the recessionary state
of the German economy.
Meanwhile, hopes of a German rate cut were boosted slightly yesterday when
two European banks slightly reduced their own rates. The Central Bank of
Denmark shaved  1/4 percentage point off its discount and key deposit rates,
bringing them to 6 per cent, the ninth such cut since August.
The Austrian National Bank cut its GOMEX rate by 10 basis points to 5.5 per
cent, effective Friday, opening up the differential between its own rate and
the equivalent German repo rate to the highest since June.
Dealers suggested that if the Bundesbank lowered rates today the Central
Bank of Denmark might cut further. But in light of today's holiday in some
German states, the market suspicion is that the most likely reduction will
now come in the repo rate next week.
The Bundesbank gave no hint of its intentions by allotting DM97.4bn at its
securities repurchase tender at a fixed rate of 6.00 per cent. This was the
last of a series of fixed rate repos announced in December.
In England, scepticism about the prospect of a UK rate cut is gathering
pace, after a comment from Sir Nicholas Goodison, TSB chairman. Sir Nicholas
said that now the British economy was recovering 'there will be pressure to
reduce interest rates. But this should be resisted.'
His scepticism was echoed on the futures market, where both the March and
June dated short sterling contracts yesterday fell slightly. March closed at
94.72, down from an opening position of 94.76.
The pound held on to most of its gains achieved in recent days, finishing at
DM2.5860, almost a pfennig up from Tuesday's close of DM2.5780.
The Spanish currency slithered yesterday to its lowest level since August
16, closing at Pta83.18 per D-Mark, from the previous day's Pta82.62. The
prospect of a general strike scheduled for the end of the month, coupled
with fears about the rising Spanish inflation, was likely to weaken the
peseta further, dealers said.

FT  06 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Collateral plan may solve CIS
aluminium problem
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Support is growing for an ingenious potential solution to the world
aluminium supply crisis that would involve surplus metal from the
Commonwealth of Independent States being used as collateral for US
government-guaranteed loans to the CIS.
'This would remove the excess supply from the market, provide hard currency
to the CIS, and, with the stipulation that a portion of the funds be used to
upgrade CIS smelters, would improve the physical environment surrounding the
smelters, which has been devastated by years of neglect,' suggests Mr Eli
Epstein, chief executive of Calcined Coke Corporation, the New York-based
concern that formulated the proposals.
It would also do away with the need for the world-wide smelter production
cuts now under consideration - and the associated unemployment - or
restrictions on imports from the CIS of the kind at present in force in the
European Union.
Calco, a big supplier to the international aluminium industry, has discussed
its ideas with members of the US Congress and representatives of the US
Export-Import Bank as well as other industry members and the response has
been 'encouraging,' says Mr Epstein.
He hopes that the Calco proposals will be on the agenda when trade
representatives from the world's main aluminium-producing countries and the
industry meet in Brussels on January 18 and 19 for a third round of talks
about the crisis arising from the sudden surge in CIS exports following the
collapse of the former Soviet Union. This has pushed up aluminium stocks and
driven down prices to a level where most smelters are suffering operating
losses.
Calco estimates that the present value of the CIS surplus aluminium stocks,
about 700,000 tonnes, is roughly Dollars 700m. It suggests that the entire
surplus be securely warehoused and becomes collateral for the US government
guarantee of loans made to the CIS by financial institutions. Loans provided
to the CIS would substantially exceed the value of the stocks but the
collateral would reduce the risk attached to these loans and support the US
commitment to helping the CIS economically.
Surplus stock would be held off the market until it could comfortably be
absorbed. After a time, aluminium demand, which is growing at an annual 1.5
to 2.5 per cent, should catch up with supply and allow for the release of
stocks into the market in a controlled fashion.
'The substantial influx of capital to the CIS will trigger economic
development which should increase its domestic demand for primary
aluminium,' Mr Epstein points out. If loans were repaid the aluminium would
be returned to the CIS at planned intervals and if there was a default the
metal would be sold gradually at predetermined price levels.
Mr Epstein suggests that if the scheme is implemented, 'the aluminium
industry worldwide would benefit from stable pricing and employment. The CIS
would have a source of hard currency and be able to reduce the environmental
impact of its inefficient smelters. Using the inventory as collateral would
reduce the risk of default on the loans and, with import restrictions
unnecessary, free trade relationships are maintained.'

   CALCUTTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Union has set a time-table for all tea-producing countries to
reduce pesticide residues in processed tea to acceptable levels if they want
to retain access to the EU market. According to Indian tea industry
officials, the EU is requiring reductions in three two-yearly stages
beginning this month.
The Indian industry, which exports over 200m kg of tea a year, thinks the
problem can be tackled largely by scrupulously following the spraying
schedules laid down by the Tea Research Association and the United Planters'
Association.
The Indian Tea Board has started consultation with the producers, exporters
and research organisations to formulate a strategy gradually to reduce the
levels of pesticide residues in teas grown in different parts of the country
without disturbing the volume of production.
Japan has recently expressed concern about the rising level of pesticide
residues in Darjeeling teas and has rejected some shipments. Some German tea
buyers have also complained about pesticide residues in Indian teas.

FT  06 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Congress 'still needs
convincing' on Gatt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Mike Espy, US agriculture secretary, cast doubt on the acceptance by the
US Congress of the recent General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade settlement
yesterday when he said its passage would not be 'automatic'.
'I don't think we need to add or subtract anything to the basic Gatt
agreement, but we need to explain it to Congress,' he told an audience of
British farmers at the Oxford Farming Conference.
While the deal presented a good opportunity for US farmers to expand their
markets overseas, congress needed to be convinced of the benefits, Mr Espy
explained. He said, however, that last minute changes to the Blair House
accord, which allow the US to subsidise an additional 7.4m tonnes of wheat
exports in the six years from 1995, would help to win congressional support
for the deal.
Modifications to the Blair House agreement will see the US Export
Enhancement Programme budget rise by Dollars 694m in 1995 from the planned
level of about Dollars 1bn.
'The US will continue to compete toe to toe on subsidies with other large
exporters which are doing the same thing,' Mr Espy said. 'I hope the Gatt
agreement will be passed through congress, but until it does we must
maintain our levels of competitiveness whether through export enhancement or
other measures.'
However, Mr Espy said he saw the handwriting on the wall for export
subsidies: 'We will join hands with others to go down the slippery slope of
subsidy reduction together,' he told the conference.
Mr Espy was met with a fairly frosty reception from some UK farmers, who saw
their livelihoods threatened by falling support prices.
'The Gatt deal is a major threat to European farmers and you couldn't care a
fig about us,' one producer commented. 'Farmers here are frightened of a
life without subsidies after the privileged world we've lived in,' said
another.
Conference organisers admitted that Mr Espy's bodyguards had feared for his
safety amid 500 British agriculturalists.
UK producers are also suspicious of moves by the US this year to abandon
acreage reduction programmes while European farmers must set-aside up to 15
per cent of their land. US producers are currently being urged to grow more
to make up for a shortfall in output caused by last year's massive flooding.
Mr Espy said that 21m acres of farmland in the Midwest had been under water
with 8m acres totally destroyed because it was covered with six to seven
feet of silt and sand.

FT  06 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Incoming Chilean copper chief
objects to military burden
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID PILLING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SANTIAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Codelco, Chile's state copper company, should not be obliged to hand over 10
per cent of its earnings to the armed forces, according to Mr Juan Villarzu,
who takes over as the company's president in March.
Under legislation brought in by Chile's former military government, Codelco
last year financed the armed forces to the tune of some Dollars 190m, about
a fifth of the defence ministry's total budget.
'The way funds are channelled at the moment is not appropriate from the
point of view of economic efficiency or the functioning of the country,'
said Mr Villarzu, who was appointed head of Codelco by the president-elect,
Mr Eduardo Frei.
The removal of the requirement to supplement the armed forces budget would
be an essential step towards any long-term plans to privatise Codelco, since
no private company would be willing to take on such a heavy burden. However,
Mr Frei's administration has ruled out any question of selling off the state
entity, which is considered to be of 'strategic' importance to the Chilean
economy.
Instead, Mr Villarzu has promised that he will push ahead with modernisation
plans aimed at boosting productivity, which is necessary because of
declining ore grades, years of inadequate investment and the appreciation of
the Chilean peso. He has fully backed moves to split Codelco's four
principal mines into autonomous divisions, each of which would be expected
to turn in a profit.
It was 'perfectly feasible' to expect the modernisation plans, which
included the gradual reduction of staff, to improve productivity
'significantly' within five years, he said.
Mr Villarzu also said that a more efficient Codelco should be in a position
to develop important new ore bodies such as Radomiro Tomic and Mansa Mina.
He rejected as 'pressure from certain elements on the right' suggestions
that Codelco should exploit such reserves through joint-venture operations
with private mining companies.
'We don't see the necessity of this,' he said. 'We believe that Codelco can
exploit such reserves on its own, but only when there are clear guarantees
that it has achieved better management.'

<DATELINE>
   KUALA LUMPUR
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The new year has started well for the world's natural rubber producers with
prices rising in response to increased demand in many industrialised
economies and a squeeze on supplies caused by a fall off in production in
major producing countries.
Mr Aldo Hofmeister, the Kuala Lumpur-based buffer stock manager of the
International Natural Rubber Organisation, says he expects natural rubber
prices to rise by about 5 per cent in 1994, compared with last year.
'I am not too pessimistic,' says Mr Hofmeister. 'The US economy continues to
rebound and West Europe is expected to improve by mid-year. Japan is still a
question mark, but South Korea is doing well.'
As an indication of the strong uptrend in prices, the Inro five-day moving
average has risen to 171.66 Malaysian/Singapore cents a kilogram, compared
with an eight-year low in natural rubber prices of 156.31
Malaysian/Singapore cents at the end of September.
Traders say there has been a fall off in production in Malaysia, Thailand
and, to a lesser extent, Indonesia because of an extended monsoon season.
Malaysia's 1993 production is estimated to have fallen to 1.19m tonnes from
1.22m tonnes in 1992.
Traders say buying in of more than 20,000 tonnes of natural rubber by the
Inro buffer stock manager at the end of last year also helped prices. The
Inro natural rubber stockpile is now estimated at slightly more than 200,000
tonnes.

FT  06 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Jamaican government sells sugar
mills
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KINGSTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Jamaican government has sold four of five state-owned sugar mills to
local and foreign investors who have promised to refurbish the plants and
increase production.
The sale is part of a programme of divestment of state economic enterprises,
and the purchasers have paid USDollars 43.8m for the mills, which have an
aggregate rated capacity of 270,000 tonnes a year.
Tate and Lyle of the UK is included in one consortium, which has brought the
Frome, Monymusk and Bernard Lodge mills. Other members of the group include
Wray and Nephew, one of Jamaica's leading distillers. The Long Pond mill has
been bought by a group made up of local companies involved in financial
services.
The fifth state-owned mill is not being offered for sale as it has been
leased to a privately-owned company, said government officials. The island's
four other mills are privately owned.
The purchasers of the four mills plan to invest Dollars 43m to modernise the
plants and to increase efficiency, cutting production costs and lifting
output from the current level of just over half rated capacity. The smaller
privately owned mills have been running at 90 per cent of rated capacity,
the officials said.
The purchasers are also leasing 38,000 acres of cane farms, which will
supply the mills. The government says state-owned cane farms will be
divested over the next two years.
The proceeds from the sake of the mills will be used by the government to
settle the industry's outstanding obligations, including the repayment of
Dollars 16m to the World Bank and Dollars 13.5m for redundancy payments to
workers.
Government officials said they were hoping that the improvements to the
mills by the new owners would lift Jamaica's sugar production in two years
to about 350,000 tonnes a year. Production last year was 224,500 tonnes,
marginally higher than in 1992.
The officials said that the divestment would also make Jamaica's sugar
industry more competitive by reducing production costs from the current
average of 19 US cents a pound. 'If this can be cut by about one third then
we will be able to compete on the world market with the additional sugar we
expect the country to produce,' said one official.

FT  06 JAN 94 / International Bonds: Abbey National launches Dollars 1bn
three-year offering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Abbey National was the focus of attention yesterday as the UK bank launched
a Dollars 1bn, three-year deal.
Abbey National is a fairly frequent borrower and has already launched large
five-year and 10-year deals in the Eurodollar sector.
However, Mr Gareth Jones, Abbey National's treasurer, said that he was keen
to tap investor demand for the US currency by launching a short-dated issue,
given the current uncertainty over the direction of US interest rates.
'We believe this will be the new three-year benchmark issue,' said one
syndicate official, noting good demand from institutional investors on the
continent.
The proceeds of the bonds, which have a 5 per cent coupon, were swapped into
floating rate dollars to provide funding at 'a few basis points above
Libor', Mr Jones said.
The market continued to see plenty of post-holiday activity with new issues
in a wide range of currencies, particularly the Eurolira sector.
Yesterday saw the launch of a total of L650bn of Eurolira deals, following
Tuesday's total of L950bn.
Syndicate officials are also expecting a L1,000bn issue soon from the
European Investment Bank.
From the issuers' point of view, the flood of Eurolira issues reflects the
relatively attractive swap opportunities, mainly into US dollar floating and
fixed rate.
Eurolira specialists point out that the sector had been practically devoid
of new issues since early December, and in the secondary market Eurolira
issues are trading well above par.
Some syndicate managers admitted that demand was slack, which they
attributed to the holiday mood.
However, they hope investors will be lured by the high coupons available and
the prospect of a cut in Italian interest rates.
In the other higher-yielding European sectors, Goldman Sachs is expected
next week to bring a substantial global bond issue, denominated in Finnish
markka, for Finnish Export Credit. The initial tranche will be for between
FM1.5bn and FM2bn, with the issue increasing to about FM3bn later in the
year.
The bonds, which will have a maturity of between five and seven years, are
expected to offer a relatively high coupon, combined with the prospect of
declining interest rates and an improving economic background.
Total Eurobond issuance in Finnish markka in 1993 amounted to Dollars 70m
equivalent.

FT  06 JAN 94 / Government Bonds: Traders' hopes for German rate cuts fade
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
After rallying sharply in the last weeks of 1993, European bond markets have
started the new year on a sour note, and continued their recent slippage
yesterday as traders scaled back expectations for imminent German monetary
easing.
Before the Christmas break, the Bundesbank had been widely expected to cut
key lending rates early in the year, said Mr Stephen Dulake, bond strategist
at PaineWebber International.
However, 'there was an air of speculation about the December rally', and the
latest correction in European bond prices might be seen as a shake-out of
short-term speculative positions rather than concerted investor selling, Mr
Dulake said.
Amid D-Mark weakness and a lack of fresh economic data, few market
participants expect the Bundesbank's central bank council to cut official
interest rates at today's meeting.
'The most we can expect is a fixed-rate repo at a slightly lower rate,
around 5.90 per cent,' said Mr Stuart Thomson, senior economist at Nikko
Europe.
However, such a move would leave the repo rate only 15 basis points above
the discount rate, which is 'too tight for comfort,' he said.
Others felt the Bundesbank might hold the repo rate unchanged at 6 per cent,
but lower the discount rate to make room for future easing. Since early
December, the Bundesbank has held the repo rate at 6 per cent.
Meanwhile, Bundesbank council member Mr Jurgen Koebnick said in a radio
interview that 'the level of short-term interest rates is too high for the
recession that we find ourselves in,' and that the Bundesbank would continue
to lower rates in the course of 1994. However, he stressed that the
Bundesbank must ease cautiously in order to maintain exchange-rate
stability, as Germany relies heavily on capital inflows.
The March bund futures contract ended at 100.81, down 0.15 point from
Tuesday's close.
Rate cuts in Denmark and Austria led their bond markets to outperform
Germany. After the Danish central bank lowered its discount rate by 25 basis
points to 6 per cent, the Danish 10-year yield spread over its German
counterpart narrowed to 50 basis points, from 55 on Tuesday.
Austria cut its Gomex rate by 10 basis points to 6 per cent and its 10-year
yield premium over bunds shrank to around 21 basis points, from 25 at
Tuesday's close.
French bonds tracked bunds lower, leaving the 10-year yield gap over Germany
unchanged at 10 basis points. The notional futures contract on Matif fell
0.04 point to 130.38.
UK gilts also weakened as the market paused after its year-end rally. 'Gilts
haven't had a significant correction during their recent run, and many
investors are taking a breather,' said Mr Jan Laury, head of gilts sales at
Daiwa Europe.
The March long gilt future fell by  9/16 to 118 13/16 .
Having flirted with optimism the previous session, the US Treasury market
turned gloomy yesterday amid further signs of economic acceleration and
higher oil prices.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  3/4 lower at 97
31/32 , with the yield rising to 6.398 per cent. At the short end, the
two-year note was down  1/16 to 99 29/32 , to yield 4.283 per cent.
Prices ebbed in early trading as profit-takers capitalised on a burst of
buying late on Tuesday.
The upturn, the first in seven sessions, had followed news suggesting that
sales growth in the car and retail sectors was easing.
However, yesterday's economic news was stronger than expected and undercut
any confidence on inflation that had been restored the day earlier. The
Commerce Department reported that November factory orders rose 1.4 per cent,
against forecasts of 1.3 per cent and an October increase of 1.2 per cent.
Rising oil prices in the afternoon put further pressure on the long end,
which is most sensitive to developments that could trigger higher consumer
and producer prices.
Traders expect no significant movements until Friday, when December
employment figures are due.

exchanges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Turnover on futures and options exchanges across Europe reached record
levels last year, according to figures published yesterday.
The London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange traded
101,875,805 contracts, up 42 per cent over 1992 and passing the 100m mark
for the first time. Average daily volume rose to a record 402,671 contracts.
Germany's futures and options exchange, the Deutsche Terminborse (DTB), also
set records, with 50.1m contracts traded - a 44 per cent increase over 1992.
Average daily volume was 199,115 contracts.
DTB trading in options on the Dax share index rose by 53 per cent to 21.4m
contracts. The biggest increase in volume was in Bobl-futures trading, which
rose by 172 per cent to 4.5m contracts.
The French futures and options exchange, the Matif, saw a slightly less
dramatic increase in trading volume, up 30 per cent over the 1992. Turnover
totalled 72,263,961 contracts, bringing average daily volume to 287,000
lots.
The total number of exchange-traded equity derivative contracts cleared last
year on OLMX, the London securities and derivatives exchange and OM
Stockholm was 11,888,438, an increase of 23.5 per cent on 1992.

FT  06 JAN 94 / International Capital Markets: CGIP follows trend with
FFr994m issue
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CGIP, the holding company, has become the latest French group to take
advantage of the buoyant Paris financial markets, by announcing a FFr994m
convertible bond issue.
The company, which last year took part in a high-profile deal to raise its
stake in CarnaudMetalBox, the Anglo-French packaging group, is giving
existing investors first claim to the issue by offering them one convertible
bond for every eight shares that they already own.
The new bonds will be priced at FFr1,350 each, against a market price of
FFr1,218 for CGIP shares, which fell FFr32 yesterday.
CGIP's industrial interests include a stake in the Cap Gemini Sogeti
computer services concern. It has been keen to raise new capital since the
CarnaudMetalBox deal, which depleted its cash resources and prompted it to
sell a number of assets.
The CGIP issue follows a recent stream of cash-raising exercises by French
companies. Credit Commercial de France, the banking group, this week
announced a share issue of between FFr1.3bn and FFr1.5bn.
Unedic, the French unemployment benefit fund, has asked banks for proposals
on how best to launch a bond worth up to FFr22bn, Reuter reports from Paris.

Saturn, an experimental car company set up by General Motors to compete more

GM for a new model in the 1996-97 period, writes Martin Dickson in New York.
Saturn makes a single model, distributed through a dedicated retailer
network.
The subsidiary, which began manufacturing in 1990, earned a small profit in
1993 after taxes but before interest payments on Dollars 1.9bn of debt, Mr
Thomas Manoff, vice-president for finance, said yesterday at the Detroit
Auto Show. It is Saturn's first annual profit.

fund row
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Smith Barney Shearson, the Wall Street brokerage house, and Mellon Bank, the
US banking group, yesterday ended their row over who should administer
mutual funds from the old Shearson Lehman firm when they reached a
settlement that will allow the two companies to share the administration of
the disputed funds.
The agreement concludes a four-month feud between the two companies. Last
month, Mellon had secured an injunction preventing Smith Barney Shearson
from diverting its mutual fund administration business away from the Boston
Company, the money management operation which Mellon bought from Shearson
for Dollars 1.45bn in 1992.
The injunction came on the heels of a lawsuit Mellon had filed contending
that Smith Barney Shearson had broken an agreement drawn up when Shearson
merged with Smith Barney in March 1993. Under the terms of that pact, the
Boston Company was to administer Shearson's mutual funds, as had been agreed
when the firm was sold to Mellon the year before.
Under yesterday's settlement, however, Smith Barney Shearson agreed to pass
on some of the administrative business for its funds to the Boston Company.
The two sides said the agreement would last until May 2000.

FT  06 JAN 94 / International Company News: More job cuts possible, says
Digital's European president
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Vincenzo Damiani, Digital Equipment's newly appointed European president,
yesterday outlined a detailed plan to restore growth and profitability to
the US computer company's European operations.
Some 400 staff at the company's headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland,
yesterday heard him prescribe measures to regenerate growth, improve
efficiency and develop closer relationships with customers and business
partners.
He said it was a 'distinct possibility' that more jobs would be lost in
Europe than the 3,000 planned for this financial year. Digital employs some
30,000 people in Europe.
Yesterday's meeting was the first in a 60-day programme of visits throughout
Europe at which Mr Damiani, who was a senior manager with International
Business Machines before joining Digital last December, intends to explain
his plans to the European workforce.
Digital was at one time second only to IBM among computer manufacturers, but
it has been hit by falling prices and moves by customers to smaller,
industry-standard computer systems. European markets traditionally provide
Digital with half its revenue, but weakness in Italy and Germany contributed
to a 9 per cent fall in operating revenues in the first-quarter results.
Mr Damiani was with IBM for 29 years, His final appointment there was
general manager for marketing and services. A member of IBM's management
elite, his move to Digital was met with some surprise by former colleagues.
Mr Damiani's objectives for the company will be met, he says, by 10 'action
points'. He intends, for example, to focus Digital's resources on small and
medium-sized companies while identifying a number of niche markets in
specific industries and for specific products.
A major aim will be to increase marketing and selling competency while
forming new relationships with business partners - software houses and
systems integrators able to add value to Digital's hardware. The company has
pinned much of its hopes on its high powered 'Alpha' microprocessor chip,
but the market has proved slow to develop and Digital has found it difficult
to grow sales of its newly-introduced personal computer ranges beyond its
existing customers.

FT  06 JAN 94 / International Company News: GE Capital takes 20% stake in
ship management company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
General Electric Capital Corporation has acquired a 20 per cent stake in V
Ships, a Monaco-based ship management company, in a move which is expected
to lead to increased investment by GE Capital in the shipping sector.
V Ships is one of the largest ship management companies, maintaining and
crewing vessels for their owners and, to a lesser extent, providing and
operating vessels for investors seeking to put funds into the shipping
sector. It has 150 ships under management.
The company is currently jointly owned by Vlasov Group, a shipowning
company, and by its own directors. Both will reduce their holdings to 40 per
cent.
The price of the transaction was not revealed.
GE Capital has historically provided leasing finance and subordinated loan
finance to the shipping industry, while it is also has a large container
leasing arm.
The demand for new vessels built to higher environmental standards,
including the provision of double-hulled tankers, and the ageing of the
present fleet is expected to lead to substantial new shipping investment
over the next few years.
An investment in V Ships will enable GE Capital to address these issues
better, the two companies said in a joint statement.
GE also expects to be able to pursue more extensive shipping projects,
normally involving investing in vessels under management.
News of the GE/V Ships deal comes within a few months of a spate of equity
issues by shipping companies in London, New York and Scandinavia.

FT  06 JAN 94 / International Company News: Mobil hit by one-off Dollars
250m charge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS and RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The slump in world oil prices has forced Mobil, the US energy group, to
announce a Dollars 250m charge to cover a write-down in the value of its
inventory.
However, the one-off hit is unlikely to be matched by write-downs at other
big oil groups when the industry reports its full-year results shortly.
Mobil's charge, a non-cash item which will be recorded in its results for
the fourth quarter of 1993, arises from the timing of the company's move to
last in, first out accounting (lifo) for the oil inventory of its
international operations.
The company made the switch in 1982, after the oil price surge of 1979.
Other big oil groups are all believed to have adopted lifo accounting before
1979.
As a result, the book value of Mobil's inventory is higher per barrel than
its competitors, forcing it to take a charge when oil prices fall sharply.
Trans World Airlines, the US carrier which emerged from Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection in November, said it had parted with its top two
executives: Mr William Howard, chairman and chief executive, and Mr Glenn
Zander, vice-chairman, writes Richard Tomkins.
In a terse statement, TWA said the two had resigned. Mr Zander was said to
have left for personal reasons but there was no explanation for Mr Howard's
departure.
TWA said Mr Howard's place would be taken by Mr Donald Craib, an existing
board member who was formerly chairman and chief executive of Allstate
Insurance Group. Mr Robin Wilson, vice-chairman and chief operations
officer, would retain those positions, the company said.

FT  06 JAN 94 / International Company News: Tokyo's high price of prestige -
Fewer foreign companies are willing to pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WAYNE APONTE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After four consecutive years of declining Japanese equity prices, Tokyo
Stock Exchange (TSE) officials are conditioned to expect the worse.
The delisting last month by three international companies hardly came as a
surprise. But the news was one more blow to the TSE's plans to make Tokyo a
truly international exchange.
Each of the three - Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI), Dial Corp., and ITT
 -said maintaining a Tokyo listing was a heavy financial burden, and
complained about a decrease in shareholders and a drop in trading volume.
They are likely to be followed by other international companies, as the cost
of a presence in Tokyo is not matched by the prestige of a listing on the
world's second-largest exchange.
TSE officials hoped that a listing would be essential for both a foreign
company's global image and for its business relations in Japan. Mr Eisuki
Nagatomo, the director of the TSE's office of listing supervision, said that
the exchange was disappointed that 'so many foreign companies' have delisted
over the past two years, and that no new companies were interested in
listing.
'Japanese investors don't have an interest in their shares because they
can't gain substantial profits,' he said.
Brokers say that Japanese private investors have received high dividend
yields from some foreign issues during the last decade, but the yen's
appreciation against western currencies has erased the capital gains, making
them less attractive investments.
The primary reason for the recent exodus from the TSE's foreign section,
however, is the plunge of the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 issues coupled
with the subsequent decline in investor interests and local shareholders.
The Nikkei-225 average, which reached an all-time high of 38,915.87 in late
1989, ended 1993 near 17,000, and market participants have little reason to
hope for a big increase in Japanese equity prices this year.
Ten foreign companies withdrew from the exchange in 1993, bringing the total
of listed companies on the foreign section of the TSE down to 110.
During 1992, high-profile companies such as General Motors, Philips
Electronics, and Avon, the US-based cosmetics and toiletry manufacturer,
delisted. Nynex, the US communications company, and Robeco, the
Netherlands-based banking and insurance company, have sought a delisting
next month.
Brokers say there are few good reasons for international companies to
maintain a presence on the exchange amid Japan's prolonged weak economy and
financial markets. Average daily trading volume on the foreign section of
the TSE peaked in 1987 with 2.75m shares; but for September 1993 it totalled
295,000 shares.
Only those companies that deem a Tokyo listing indispensable for their core
business, rather than for financing from Japanese investors, are likely to
remain.
The daily exposure that comes with a Tokyo listing does have value in Japan,
and does help build domestic business relationships. But, balanced against
the cost, international companies have not been receiving the benefits over
the past few years that they expected. The high cost of translating
documents into Japanese and issuing financial reports to the finance
ministry have only added to their economic woes.
In the case of ICI, the overall annual cost of a Tokyo listing in 1992 was
about Dollars 182,000, the company said. ICI's shareholders plunged to 39 in
1993 from 1,200 in 1988, it added.
The question facing the TSE this year is how many more companies will find
this cost too much to bear.

FT  06 JAN 94 / International Company News: BSkyB deputy takes over at Asian
satellite Star
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Gary Davey, deputy managing director of BSkyB, is taking over as chief
executive of Star TV, the Asian satellite venture, 'with immediate effect'.
Mr Davey, who worked for Sky Television since 1983, before its merger with
BSB to form BSkyB, replaces Mr Jim Griffiths, who began running the
five-channel Star in August after Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation took
a majority stake in a Dollars 525m deal.
The previous chief executive of Star, Mr Julian Mounter, decided to resign
soon after Mr Murdoch took control.
Star, which broadcasts by satellite to 38 Asian countries, is now believed
to be available in more than 20m homes.
Last year Mr Murdoch made it clear that he wanted to have specially tailored
services for India and China, because they were such different cultures. A
separate Indonesian service could follow later.
One possibility is a specially dedicated channel for the Indian
sub-continent. At the moment the package distributed everywhere includes BBC
World Service Television, MTV and a Chinese language channel.
The future of the BBC channel on Star was yesterday said to be 'under
discussion'; there is said to be a break point in the contract later this
year. Star has been planning the launch of a pay television film service in
Asia for some time, but no firm launch date has been set and the matter is
said to be under review.
Mr Sam Chisholm, managing director of BSkyB, a consortium in which News Corp
has a 50 per cent stake and Pearson, owners of the Financial Times, has a
stake, remains in overall charge of both BSkyB and Star.
Pearson's bid for Star failed because the company insisted that Star founder
and Hong Kong billionaire Mr Li Ka-shing remain an investor until after the
return of Hong Kong to Chinese rule.

FT  06 JAN 94 / International Company News: Assets soar 42% to peak at
Robeco

<TEXT>
Robeco, the Dutch-based investment fund manager, said assets under
management rose by 42 per cent to a record Fl 65.8bn (Dollars 34bn) in 1993
from Fl 46.4bn in 1992.
The surge was due to an increase in the value of assets, reflecting buoyant
capital markets, and a 25 per cent rise in client base to 600,000 investors.
Robeco's strategic partnership with Rabobank, the Dutch co - operative bank,
yielded around Fl 5bn in new funds from investors seeking to compensate for
the decline in interest paid on savings accounts.
Robeco said all its investment funds showed 'excellent' results last year.
Its funds include equity, bond, money market and property investment
vehicles.
The group's flagship Robeco equity fund, which invests in shares around the
world, achieved a performance of 30.0 per cent in 1993, compared with 9.6
per cent in 1992.

FT  06 JAN 94 / International Company News: Swiss telecoms group's scramble
 -Ian Rodger examines Ascom's struggle to regain credibility after last
year's reports of heavy losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Such is the sorry state of Ascom that a newspaper article yesterday
reminding investors the Swiss telecommunications equipment maker had lost a
semi-exclusive contract with the local PTT was enough to cut 5 per cent off
the value of the shares.
Ascom responded quickly, pointing out it had just signed a new contract for
selling private branch exchanges (PBX) to the PTT, and expected to maintain
its dominant position in this SFr300m (Dollars 202m) a year market. But to
little immediate effect.
The group lost most of its credibility in the financial community last year
when its profit forecasts were overtaken by reports of heavy losses. It
sacked its chief executive, Mr Leonardo Vannotti, early last month and
announced its third divisional reorganisation in as many years.
But no one expects a quick turnround. Ascom was formed in 1987 from the
merger of three traditional protected suppliers to the Swiss PTT. It was
then apparent that the domestic market would be liberalised, and the hope
was that a merged group could acquire sufficient scale to become a
competitive international supplier.
Today, the prevailing view among analysts and perhaps even within the group
is that it cannot.
'This is a classical example of a merger that did not work,' says Mr Roland
Leutenegger, an analyst at Bank Julius Baer in Zurich.
The problem, analysts say, is that none of the group's main businesses is
large enough to be internationally competitive. Moreover, the group does not
have the resources to buy large scale, and a stifling ownership structure
prevents it from raising new capital.
The Hasler Werke Foundation, owner of the largest of the predecessor
companies, has a 54 per cent voting stake and is required by its statutes to
maintain a majority. However, as it has only modest resources, it cannot
allow Ascom to raise new equity capital nor make large scale, equity related
joint ventures.
Since Mr Vannotti's departure, the shares have risen about 20 per cent,
apparently in anticipation of a tough turnround expert being appointed as
the new chief executive. But analysts are sceptical.
'The problem is not as simple as in other turnrounds,' Mr Volkan Gocmen, an
analyst at Geneva bankers Pictet &amp; Co, says.
The group has some successful product lines that it could sell off in a
first stage, such as its payphones and ticket vending and automatic teller
machines. But it has no businesses where it could be reasonably certain that
massive new investment would pay off, he argues.
In the directors' December restructuring announcement, they said the three
new divisions would operate independently to 'facilitate co-operation with
one or more industrial partners'. They have also appealed to the Swiss
government to alter the statutes of the Hasler Foundation.
Agreement has already been reached to hive off the loss-making private
mobile radio division to a joint venture that would be controlled by
Germany's Robert Bosch and observers expect that co-operation arrangements
with Ericsson of Sweden in transmission products will be expanded.
Recent interest in the shares may therefore be a play on the group's net
asset value. At the end of 1992, this was SFr2.45bn or SFr2,600 a share. The
1993 loss is widely expected to be close to SFr300m or SFr700 per share, but
that would still leave the book value above yesterday's close of SFr1,375
per bearer share.
Mr Leutenegger rates the shares a hold on this basis, even assuming the need
to devalue some assets.
Mr Gocmen is more sceptical. 'Who is going to be interested in buying
telecoms production capacity in Switzerland?' he asks.

FT  06 JAN 94 / International Company News: GBL rights issue makes
acquisitions likely
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Belgium's two largest holding companies are in the market for acquisitions,
after Groupe Bruxelles Lambert (GBL) yesterday launched a rights issue which
could raise BFr13.5bn (Dollars 251m) over the next five years.
A senior executive at GBL, Belgium's second-largest holding company, said
the cash would be used to increase stakes in favoured subsidiaries, back new
projects and seek out new purchases.
Last year Societe Generale de Belgique, Belgium's largest holding company,
indicated that it was also back in the acquisitions game after four years of
cost-cutting and retrenchment.
La Generale raised BFr22.5bn in September with the sale of its 43 per cent
stake in CBR, its cement subsidiary, and offered a 12.5 per cent stake in
Union Miniere, the metals group, to the market in November, raising a
further BFr7bn.
Under the terms of the GBL rights issue, which runs for two weeks starting
on Friday, investors will be offered one new share and three warrants for
every 30 shares already owned.
Each share-and-warrant package has been priced at BFr4,600, raising BFr3.5bn
immediately. Those who subscribe will be able to exercise their warrants at
BFr4,400 a share up to the end of 1998.
GBL, which already has net cash of BFr5bn, owns large stakes in Petrofina,
the Belgian oil company, Banque Bruxelles Lambert (BBL), one of Belgium's
big three banks, and CLT, the Luxembourg-based television, radio and media
group, among others.
Before the pricing was announced, GBL's shares closed at BFr4,080, up BFr45
on the day, and their highest price since 1990.

FT  06 JAN 94 / International Company News: MCA joins consortium for Osaka
theme park
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MCA, the Japanese-owned US entertainment group, announced yesterday it was
joining a consortium to develop a theme park in the Japanese city of Osaka,
which would be modelled on its Universal Studios park in Florida.
Universal Studios Japan will cost more than Dollars 1bn to build.
Construction will begin in 1996 and the park is scheduled to open in the
spring of 1999.
Other members of the consortium include the city of Osaka and companies
based in the city, including Matsushita Electric Industrial, MCA's parent.
MCA said yesterday the Rank Organisation, which is its joint venture partner
in Universal Studios in Florida, might also be involved. In London, Rank
said it had the right to take part but no obligation, and was considering
its options.
The park development is a by-product of Matsushita's Dollars 6bn takeover in
1990 of MCA, which owns Hollywood's Universal film studios as well as theme
parks in California and Florida based on its movies. It is the first major
project by the two companies in Japan.
Mr Frank Stanek, head of MCA Enterprises International, said equity
participants would include both MCA and Matsushita but it was too early to
give a breakdown of investors' stakes.
The park will be built on a waterfront site owned by industrial companies
involved in the consortium, and might be followed by the development of
adjacent properties as a complete urban resort.
The success of Tokyo Disneyland, which attracts some 16m visitors a year,
suggests there is a strong Japanese taste for theme parks.
MCA believes that an Osaka site, some three hours by train from Tokyo, will
tap a different market from Disneyland. It also hopes to attract South-east
Asian visitors, helped by Osako's new airport opening later this year.

FT  06 JAN 94 / International Company News: Borden unveils plans for
shake-up and sale of units
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Borden, the troubled US food and wallpaper group that last month sacked its
chairman and chief executive, yesterday unveiled long-awaited plans for a
restructuring aimed at reversing a slump in sales and profits.
Its loss-making salty snacks business - the second biggest in the US with
sales of Dollars 750m last year - is to be put up for sale, along with its
seafood, jam and jelly businesses with turnover of Dollars 500m.
The pasta, dairy, and other grocery businesses will be kept, as will the
company's wall-covering and adhesive businesses. Borden will seek to restore
profits growth to the retained businesses by increasing sales and cutting
Dollars 100m to Dollars 125m a year from costs.
Mr Frank Tasco, who replaced Mr Anthony D'Amato as chairman in December,
said: 'The goal of this programme is to build shareholder value by focusing
on and revitalising our best businesses.'
However, the restructuring will hurt in the short term. Borden will take
charges of Dollars 650m to after-tax profits in the fourth quarter of 1993,
mainly because the loss-making businesses will have to be sold at a price
below their book value.
The result will be an after-tax loss of Dollars 590m to Dollars 600m for
1993, or Dollars 4.18 to Dollars 4.26 a share. The previous year Borden
recorded net losses of Dollars 439.6m after charges for an earlier
restructuring.
The restructuring plan envisages the annual dividend being halved to 30
cents a share in the year just begun, reflecting the likelihood of a modest
recovery in earnings to a level 'at the upper end of the 75 cents to Dollars
1 a share range' of analysts' estimates.
The shares shed Dollars 2 to Dollars 16 1/4 .
Mr Ervin Shames, Borden's chief executive, said the North American salty
snack business, comprising seven large regional operations, could be sold in
total or in parts. The aim would be to complete all sales by the end of this
year.
Mr John McMillin, an analyst at Prudential Securities, said possible buyers
of the salty snack business might include other snack manufacturers, such as
Nabisco of the US or United Biscuits of the UK, but the main interest was
likely to be in the store distribution networks rather than the loss-making
snacks themselves.
He predicted piecemeal sales totalling Dollars 250m to Dollars 300m, with
the seafood, jam and jelly businesses fetching considerably less.

<TEXT>
Germany's cartel office said the Krupp Hoesch steel group was obliged to
sell its shock absorber unit Krupp Bruenninghaus and that a change in market
conditions could not excuse the company from breaking an agreement with the
cartel office, Reuters reports from Berlin.
The cartel agency said Krupp, which as part of its 1992 acquisition of
Hoesch had agreed to sell the unit by the end of 1993, had not fulfilled
that requirement. 'In order to ensure the guarantees are fulfilled, the
cartel agency will make use of all its rights to break up this cartel,' the
agency said.
The group recently told the cartel office it could not fulfil the
requirement to sell the unit because of extremely negative economic
developments.
Krupp Hoesch shock absorber operation has annual sales of about DM900m
(Dollars 517m).

   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Belgacom, Belgium's state-owned telephone company, and Pacific Telesis
International of the US, yesterday launched a mobile phone network for
Belgium and promised even closer co-operation.
The network, which started operating on January 1, is the fruit of a
five-month alliance, the first between a public European telephone operator
and a private cellular phone company. The launch strengthens another link in
the growing network of strategic alliances between telecoms groups in Europe
and the US.
PacTel, part of Pacific Telesis - one of the seven regional US telecoms
companies - said yesterday it would go on to build a formal joint venture
with Belgacom. PacTel will own 25 per cent of the subsidiary, and expects to
conclude a deal by the middle of this year.
Mr Jan Neels, PacTel International's president and chief executive, said the
subsidiary would be responsible for the digital 'GSM' mobile phone system
launched yesterday, and Belgium's analogue cellular network, which could be
phased out as clients switch to the Europe-wide GSM network.
'If there is an opportunity, which is a good fit for Belgacom and ourselves,
we could work together in other areas . . . in Belgium or outside Belgium,'
added Mr Neels, a Belgian citizen. He said the development of paging
services might be one such opportunity.
Mr Bessel Kok, Belgacom's chief executive, said the GSM system - Proximus -
had signed up more than 2,500 subscribers since January 1.
The European Commission is still examining Belgian legislation which
prevents a competitor entering the mobile phone market, which it believes
could be incompatible with European competition rules.

FT  06 JAN 94 / International Company News: Aerospatiale shortfall less than
year before
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Aerospatiale, the French aircraft and missile group, said yesterday its
losses last year were 'significantly' less than in 1992, but it warned it
could not hope to turn in an overall profit until 1995.
Mr Louis Gallois, chairman, claimed that in the current downturn in many
aerospace and defence sectors the group had done well to limit the fall in
turnover to 5 per cent, from FFr51.9bn (Dollars 8.8bn) in 1992 to FFr49.3bn.
It had also reduced indebtedness by FFr1.5bn through cuts in investment,
lower interest rates and a lease-back operation.
But Mr Gallois was pessimistic about the near future. Last year orders fell
sharply to FFr29bn, from the FFr39bn level booked in 1992, mainly due to the
depressed market for aircraft carrying more than 100 passengers and
depressed demand for civil helicopters.
'We have hit the bottom of the swimming pool,' he said, but he could see no
sign of a recovery before 1996-1997.
The military and space business had done better last year, with Aerospatiale
winning Turkish and Dutch orders for the military helicopters it makes in
its Eurocopter joint venture with Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa) and selling more
missiles, Mr Gallois claimed, than any other European company.
It was continuing negotiations with Dasa to form joint ventures in missiles
and space equipment, along the lines of Eurocopter.
Aerospatiale, which lost FFr2.38bn in 1992 and FFr870m in the first half of
last year, is on the Balladur government's privatisation list, but Mr
Gallois acknowledged it was 'impossible to privatise a company with the sort
of balance sheet that Aerospatiale has at present'.
However, it was possible the government might soon allow other companies to
take a limited stake. Possible candidates include French companies such as
Alcatel and the Lagardere group, or indeed Dasa itself.

FT  06 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Hillsdown sells its remaining abattoir
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hillsdown Holdings has completed its exit from the red meat slaughtering
industry with the sale of its last abattoir, in Ipswich.
Over the last two years it has sold 25 abattoirs - 11 in 1992 and 14 in 1993
 -which had become lossmaking due to severe over-capacity in the industry.
Hillsdown made a provision against losses on the disposal programme which
appeared as part of a Pounds 92.3m extraordinary charge in the 1992
accounts.
Analysts believe the provision relating to abattoirs totalled about Pounds
30m and Hillsdown is expected to have utilised the whole of this covering
losses on trading and on the sales of the abattoirs.
However, the abattoir sales should have released significant working
capital. The sale was completed on December 31, also the last day of
Hillsdown's financial year.
Hillsdown's abattoirs were largely acquired when it bought FMC in 1983. It
had invested to bring the abattoirs up to new EU standards, originally due
to be introduced on January 1 1993, but later deferred until 1996.
This delay exacerbated the over-capacity in the industry partly caused by
changes in EU export subsidies which reduced the throughput of abattoirs.
Hillsdown has also announced the sale of its 67 per cent stake in Schils, a
Dutch group of companies which make milk substitutes fed to veal calves. The
buyer is the Schils management which is also the minority partner.

FT  06 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Sidney C Banks shares respond to profits
leap
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares of Sidney C Banks, the Bedfordshire-based grain and agricultural
specialist, yesterday rose 28p to 248p on news of a 35 per cent improvement
in pre-tax profits to Pounds 2.06m for the half year to October 31.
The advance, from last time's Pounds 1.53m, reflected the full benefit of
marketing stocks and grains held over at the end of the previous financial
year.
Turnover slipped to Pounds 114.3m (Pounds 119.2m) due to reduced volume from
the 1993 harvest and lower grain prices.
The interim dividend is lifted from 3p to 3.5p from earnings of 15.6p
(12.4p) per share.
Mr John Burr, who yesterday stepped down as chairman, said all divisions of
the group were operating profitably while market share had been increased
and margins maintained.
He was succeeded as chairman by Mr Alistair Mitchell-Innes, former chief
executive of Isosceles and deputy chairman of HP Bulmer.
For the 1992-93 year the group benefited from the integration of
acquisitions and reduced interest charges and achieved a rise in pre-tax
profits from Pounds 2.29m to Pounds 2.87m.

FT  06 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Extending the shake-up to the US - The
restructuring taking place at Lucas Aerospace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
From Silicon Valley to Los Angeles, from Salt Lake City to Jamestown in the
bitterly cold plains of North Dakota, Lucas has launched a sweeping
restructuring of its disparate North American aerospace activities acquired
during the industry's heady boom days of the late 1980s.
A large aircraft maintenance facility in Santa Barbara, California, acquired
three years ago, has just been closed with the loss of nearly 400 jobs. A
Los Angeles-based aircraft engine gear business, bought in 1987, is being
transferred to a new facility near Salt Lake City, Utah, to reduce costs.
This activity employed 1,200 people at its peak in 1986: the new plant will
employ only 200.
An essentially defence orientated subsidiary, Lucas Zeta, at San Jose in the
heart of California's Silicon Valley, is diversifying fast into the civil
market. When Lucas bought it in 1989, about 90 per cent of its Dollars 20m
(Pounds 13.5m) a year turnover involved microwave and communications
activities for the defence sector. The civil sector now already accounts for
40 per cent of annual turnover.
Like the rest of its UK and continental European operations, the US has not
escaped the restructuring which the company has undergone since Mr Frank
Turner took charge of Lucas Aerospace 12 months ago.
Simply put, Mr Turner's strategy has been to transform Lucas Aerospace from
a components supplier to the aerospace industry into a systems integrator.
'In the long term we cannot hope to compete as a components supplier against
low-cost producers in the Far East. Instead, we must turn the company into
the global leader in the provision and support of high integrity control
systems for our chosen markets,' explained Mr Turner, the former head of
civil engines at Rolls-Royce, the UK aero-engine and industrial power group.
The two core markets for the company are flight and engine control systems.
The fate of all the group's other activities, including the more recent US
business, will depend on their performance.
'These niche businesses can stay in our portfolio as long as they are
profitable and cash generating and can support financially our two core
activities,' said Mr Turner. He cites as examples the profitable cargo
handling operations in Jamestown which have carved themselves a strong
market as a supplier of cargo systems to Boeing as well as the profitable
electrosystems subsidiary at Brae, outside Los Angeles.
But he also warned that any business not capable of generating adequate cash
or profits will either be merged with another company, sold or shut down.
Apart from the Santa Barbara aircraft maintenance facility, the aircraft
windows business in Luton has been sold to its management. 'Our switch gear
and ignition business is also not core and we expect we will sell that at
some stage,' he said.
At the same time, Mr Turner is also looking for acquisitions to strengthen
the company's market penetration in its two core activities in engine and
flight control systems. Lucas's engine systems, for example, have been
reinforced by the Pounds 18.9m acquisition in September of Dowty's fuel
control business in Cheltenham.
These acquisitions and divestments are all part of what Mr Turner sees as
'the continuing big shake up in the aerospace industry where there is still
far too much capacity'.
Another good example of taking out capacity at a time when the aerospace
industry continued to be depressed by lower commercial aircraft and defence
sales was an agreement which will see Lucas supplying all the engine
gearboxes for Pratt &amp; Whitney, the large US aero-engine maker, Mr Turner
added.
Instead of making its own gearboxes, Pratt will be buying the equipment from
Lucas's new Utah facility.
Cost cutting has also featured high in Mr Turner's efforts to reshape Lucas
Aerospace, which with sales of Pounds 643m for the financial year ended July
1993 accounts for about 25 per cent of Lucas's overall group turnover. 'By
the end of 1993 we had shed about 25 per cent of our workforce in a period
of less than two years,' he said. This has cut the aerospace division's
10,000 strong workforce to about 7,500.
Every site in the UK, France and the US has been affected by the
cost-cutting drive, which has also been sharply felt by the company's
overweight management structure. Headquarters staff has been cut from 150 to
29 people, Mr Turner said.
Mr Turner's strategy has paid dividends. Lucas Aerospace saw pre-tax profits
double to Pounds 31m in the year ended July 1993, from Pounds 15.4m in 1992.
The advance came despite a 10 per cent real fall in the volume of aerospace
sales, reflecting a sharp improvement in productivity and costs. Mr Turner
has now set a target of a 50 per cent improvement in the group's operations
over the next three years.
The US operations, however, have continued to lose money. But Mr Turner
expects these US investments to start showing a positive contribution this
year, especially after the disposal of the substantial lossmaking aircraft
maintenance operation in Santa Barbara.
'The US acquisition policy has given us a presence in the US market and
access to big US customers,' said Mr Turner. 'It has provided us with a
foundation to build on but it will require reorganisation, including the
divestment of some assets as well as acquisitions,' he added.
Lucas's US aerospace acquisition spree in the 1980s was largely aimed at
reducing the company's dependence on the automotive business as well as the
aerospace division's dependence on Rolls-Royce. 'They nearly went down with
Rolls-Royce when Rolls went bankrupt in 1971,' said one City aerospace
analyst.
At that time, as much as 75 per cent of the company's aerospace business was
directly related with Rolls-Royce. The UK aero-engine manufacturer is still
Lucas Aerospace's biggest customer but it now accounts for only between 20
per cent to 25 per cent of its sales, although Lucas recently reinforced its
ties with Rolls-Royce. It took a 3.5 per cent risk-sharing stake in
Rolls-Royce's Trent programme to develop a family of heavy thrust commercial
jet engines to power the new generation of large wide body airliners.
Mr Turner also has his eye on expanding his group's presence in the
fast-growing Asia Pacific aerospace market. At present, the UK, the US and
continental Europe each account for about one third of the company's annual
turnover. Mr Turner wants to see the group's geographical distribution
expanded with the US, the UK, continental Europe and Asia each accounting
for about 25 per cent of sales.
As restructuring continues to gather pace in the aerospace components
industry, Mr Turner expects the sector to become increasingly dominated by
fewer, broader-based suppliers capable of participating as risk and revenue
sharing partners in future engine and aircraft programmes. 'We are
positioning Lucas to be one of those players,' he added.
Ultimately, however, the reshaping of Lucas is likely to involve even wider
strategic collaboration and possibly a merger with another big international
components and systems supplier with activities in both the aerospace and
automotive industries.
Any move, however, will have to await the arrival of Mr George Simpson, who
is leaving British Aerospace and Rover to take overall charge at Lucas as
chief executive in the spring.

FT  06 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Enterprise Oil raises Pounds 51m from
Ninian disposal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Enterprise Oil has sold its 18.5 per cent interest in the Ninian oilfield,
one of the North Sea's largest, to Chevron UK, Murphy Petroleum and Oryx UK,
three of the existing seven partners in the field. The price was Dollars 75m
(Pounds 50.6m).
Enterprise acquired the interest in 1986 when it bought ICI's exploration
and producing interests.
Mr Graham Hearne, Enterprise's chairman and chief executive, said the sale
formed part of the company's continuing programme of portfolio management.
Proceeds would be redeployed in the business.
Enterprise has been steadily unwinding its older North Sea assets. Last year
it sold its interests in the mature Hutton and North West Hutton fields. As
a result of these sales, it has relinquished its remaining interest in the
Sullum Voe oil terminal and the Brent and Ninian pipeline systems which feed
it. Its strategy is to use the proceeds of sales to fund acquisitions which
will enhance the quality of its oil portfolio.
Clyde Petroleum announced yesterday that it had sold its 1 per cent interest
in the Forties field to BP for about Pounds 5m.
Hamilton Oil has been given approval by the Department of Energy to develop
the Lennox oil and gas field in block 110/15 in Liverpool Bay. Monument Oil
and Gas has a 23.9 per cent interest in the block, which will be reduced to
20 per cent following completion of the sale of a 3.9 per cent interest to
PowerGen.

FT  06 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Crabtree Group turns in Pounds 1.07m after
takeover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Crabtree Group, the Tyne-side manufacturer and supplier of metal decorating
presses, yesterday reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.07m on turnover of
Pounds 7.73m for the nine months to September 30.
Crabtree came to the market in June via a Pounds 19.4m shares and cash
reverse takeover of Somerset, a shell quoted investment trust. The figures
for the nine months consisted solely of the activities of Crabtree of
Gateshead since its acquisition on June 21.
Earnings per share came out at 10.7p and a maiden dividend of 2p is
proposed.
Before the reverse takeover, Mr Karl Watkin, Crabtree's chairman, and Mr
Matt Cooper, managing director, warranted that in the year to end-September
1993 Crabtree would make a pre-tax profit of Pounds 3m and pledged to repay
Pounds 5 of the takeover consideration for every Pounds 1 of any shortfall.
For the full 12 months to the period-end Crabtree achieved warranted profits
of Pounds 3.01m on turnover of Pounds 23.4m.
Yesterday Mr Watkin said the Pounds 3m pre-tax profit pledge had been
achieved. 'We're delighted to deliver to the City what we promised in June,'
he said.
The Pounds 3.01m reported consisted, however, of Pounds 2.86m in pre-tax
profit, plus some adjustments specified in the reverse takeover.
The shares rose 13p to 284p yesterday. When the company came to the market
in June the shares were priced at 150p.
Crabtree of Gateshead was acquired by Mr Watkin and Mr Cooper in a Pounds
3.6m management buy-out from Vickers in 1986. It claims to be the world's
leading manufacturer of metal decorating presses and exports 93 per cent of
its turnover.
The company said its results for the 12 months to September 30 were a record
performance, with turnover 24 per cent up on the preceding year's Pounds
18.8m, and profit up by 46 per cent, from Pounds 2.06m.
Mr Watkin said future order books were 'exceptionally strong'.
Crabtree, he said, was well ahead of the competition, including the Germans
and Japanese, in the quality of its engineering as well as its marketing,
and was investing to maintain that lead.
At the time of flotation, Mr Watkin said Crabtree was looking to make a
substantial acquisition. Yesterday he said this had yet to happen because
the market was at present 'very frothy'.
Credit Lyonnais Laing, Crabtree's broker, yesterday forecast pre-tax profits
for the company in the year to September 30 1994, of Pounds 3.95m on
turnover of Pounds 25m. They also forecast earnings per share of 18.7p and a
dividend of 6p.

FT  06 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Babcock wins Pounds 39m order
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Babcock Africa, the South African subsidiary of Babcock International, has
announced a package of boiler refurbishment, materials handling and process
plant contracts worth a total of Pounds 39m.
The biggest single contract is for the redesign and replacement of pressure
parts on six boiler units at Matla power station in the Transvaal.
Babcock was the original supplier of the boilers in the early 1970s, and the
latest work is the initial stage of a programme to extend the power
station's life by 35 years.
The subsidiary has also won two other Transvaal contracts - overland
conveyors and a silo for the Alusaf aluminium smelter project, and two
circular stockpile stacker reclaimers for Randcoal's Duvha colliery.
In conjunction with Hyundai of Korea, it will supply and erect an advanced
synthol reactor for Sasol, the South African fuel and chemicals group, at
Secunda in Orange Free State.

FT  06 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Capital changes for Beckenham
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Losses on a contract for the Civil Aviation Authority have forced Beckenham
Group, the USM-traded heating and ventilation engineer, to seek a capital
reconstruction including a placing and rights issue.
The losses resulted in the withdrawal of most of its banking facilities in
September, since when the group has had to rely on short-term finance from
shareholders.
Beckenham also announced pre-tax losses of Pounds 4.2m (Pounds 5.05m) for
the year to the end of October on turnover of Pounds 31m (Pounds 34.1m),
including Pounds 1.66m this time from acquisitions. Losses per share were
4.4p (11.3p).
The changes will result in a concert party led by Mr Ng Lu Siong, a
Malaysian businessman, raising its holding to a total of 39.8 per cent. The
Takeover Panel has waived the requirement to make a full bid.
Mr Peter Long, chairman, said that after a 'nightmare three months' he was
hopeful of a better 1994, although margins would remain tight.
The company is raising Pounds 3.9m net through a placing of 15.6m shares at
25p. A further Pounds 1.09m net is being raised by a rights issue of up to
5.45m shares at 25p on the basis of 1-for-30 ordinary 5p and 26-for-27
Pounds 1 preference shares.
The total proceeds will eliminate the Pounds 4.27m of short-term loans and
increase working capital by Pounds 723,000.
In addition, 50 of the existing 5p ordinary will be consolidated into one
250p share and then divided into three 25p ordinary and seven deferred
shares.
Every 15 of the preference shares will be consolidated in one Pounds 15
share and then divided into 26 ordinary and 34 deferred.
It is proposed to eliminate the deficit on the profit and loss account by
cancelling the deferred shares and reducing the share premium account.

FT  06 JAN 94 / UK Company News: EFM launches trust for Asian markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Edinburgh Fund Managers is to launch an investment trust specialising in
smaller companies in emerging Asian markets, to be known as the Edinburgh
New Tiger Trust.
It hopes to raise Pounds 50m through a placing and offer for subscription of
ordinary shares of 5p issued at 50p, with one warrant attached to every five
shares.
The offer period is expected to be January 29 to February 18, with first
dealings on February 24.
The new fund's managers will concentrate on the emerging markets of south
and south-east Asia, including India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka as well as the
more usual Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, South Korea, China and the
Philippines.
Companies in the more established markets of Hong Kong and Singapore will be
considered if they have exposure to emerging Asian economies.
The fund will invest in smaller companies with market capitalisation of less
than Dollars 500m (Pounds 340m) with the aim of achieving long-term capital
growth.
Edinburgh Fund Managers said it believed smaller companies should outperform
their larger counterparts as their operational flexi-bility should allow
them to exploit opportunities more easily.
The same investment team already manages the EFM Dragon fund, an investment
trust covering east Asia excluding Japan.

FT  06 JAN 94 / UK Company News: ICL moves to protect profits - Restructure
measures accelerated in face of weak computer markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ICL, the UK-based computer company in which Fujitsu of Japan has a majority
stake, is accelerating measures to protect its profitability in the face of
persistently weak computer markets.
Yesterday it announced that it intended to establish its UK manufacturing
and supply business as a contract electronics business. The autonomous,
wholly owned subsidiary will trade as Design to Distribution (D2D) with
operations in Kidsgrove, Ashton-under-Lyne, and Stevenage.
It also said it had sold its half interest in International Network Services
to General Electric Information Services in a move designed to cut away
non-core activities.
The aim in creating D2D, ICL said yesterday, was to improve the new
company's attractiveness as an electronics contract manufacturer by
distancing it from the parent company, for which it manufactures computers
and circuit boards worth some Dollars 300m (Pounds 203m) a year.
ICL already manufactures equipment for Sun Microsystems of the US and Meiko,
a supercomputer manufacturer with offices in the UK and the US. It also
makes equipment for a number of unnamed US computer companies.
Mr Alastair Kelly, D2D's managing director, said his aim was to build the
company into Europe's leading contract electronics manufacturer: 'By 1996 we
will be targeting Dollars 300m of non-ICL revenue, much of which will be
with US corporations looking for European manufacturing'.
It is part of chairman and chief executive Mr Peter Bonfield's plan to
restructure ICL as some 26 semi-autonomous business units.
The value of the INS deal was not disclosed but is believed to be under
Pounds 30m.
INS is a leading provider in the UK of electronic data interchange services
such as electronic ordering and invoicing. In 1992 it made Pounds 2.9m
before tax on revenues of Pounds 17m.
Mr John Thorpe, newly appointed managing director, said that INS and GEIS
had a similar business focus, while the electronic data business was
peripheral to ICL's core interests. With GEIS backing, it would expand into
Europe, market its software internationally and provide tough competition
for BT, AT&amp;T and IBM.

FT  06 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Norwich and Scottish Life maintain trends
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Norwich Union, the mutual insurance group, yesterday announced unchanged
bonuses on its with-profits endowment policies, while Scottish Life, the
mutual life assurance company, cut its bonuses slightly, writes Bethan
Hutton.
The net effect for both was to continue the trend of slightly higher
pay-outs for 25-year maturities, but lower pay-outs after 10 years.
Norwich Union will pay Pounds 58,694 for a standard 25-year endowment policy
maturing on January 1 1994, up 0.8 per cent from last year's Pounds 58,237,
giving a yield of 12.9 per cent (12.8 per cent).
Figures are based on the standard industry assumptions of a policy started
by a man aged 29, paying Pounds 30 a month.
A 10-year policy, using the same assumptions, would pay Pounds 6,674, down
4.5 per cent from last year's pay-out of Pounds 6,992. This would give a
reduced yield of 11.9 per cent (12.7 per cent).
Scottish Life will pay Pounds 6,105 for a 10-year policy, down 2 per cent,
representing net returns of 10.2 per cent. A 25-year policy would pay Pounds
63,252 this year, up 2 per cent, a return of 13.3 per cent.
Pay-outs on 10-year endowments are still falling because of poor investment
performance in 1990-92, and in compensation for excessively high bonuses in
1990, while 25-year policies benefit from the higher average investment
returns in the 1980s.
Norwich describes its current bonus rates as 'realistic', but projects
falling rates over the next two years because of low inflation.

FT  06 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Kwik Save sells non-core side for Pounds
9.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kwik Save, the discount food retailer, is selling its Tates convenience
store subsidiary for Pounds 9.5m to AF Blakemore, the family-owned
wholesaler which is a main supplier to the Spar group.
The sale enables Kwik Save to dispose of a non-core business, and is a
significant boost for Blakemore's ambitions in the convenience store market.
Blakemore is paying Pounds 3.5m for the business, plus about Pounds 6m to
settle inter-company loans from Kwik Save to Tates.
Kwik Save acquired Tates, which operates 71 Lateshopper convenience stores
in Humberside, Yorkshire, Lincolnshire and the east Midlands, from Northern
Foods in 1986.
Mr Derek Pretty, finance director, said it was decided to sell the business
after a strategic review last year.
'We had to decide whether we wanted to feature in a major way in the
convenience store market. If we did, we realised we would have to invest
more.'
Before the sale, Kwik Save bought the freehold of 35 Tates stores for Pounds
7.6m and granted Tates 25-year leases on the properties.
Rental income from the properties will total Pounds 700,000 a year.
Mr Pretty said the net financial effect of the disposal on Kwik Save would
be minimal.
Tates made pre-tax profits in its last financial year of Pounds 1.4m on
sales of Pounds 57.8m.
Blakemore, based in the West Midlands, operates eight cash-and-carry
outlets, as well as supplying 640 Spar and VG stores across central England
and Wales.
These so-called 'symbol' groups comprise independent retailers, who trade
under the same fascia and buy from the same source to reap the benefits of
centralised buying and distribution, advertising and marketing.
Blakemore itself also owns and operates 36 Spar stores.

FT  06 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Riva shares tumble 7p on profits warning
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Riva Group yesterday saw its shares fall 7p to 18p after the USM-traded
supplier of electronic point of sale systems warned of a substantial loss
for 1993.
The company said that a number of overseas subsidiaries had suffered
disappointing trading results. Consequently, a number of write-downs might
be necessary in some European operations.
UK operations had maintained profitability.
Riva said it had repaid more than Pounds 1m of its UK bank debt and had
renegotiated facilities with its principal lenders on a continuing basis.
Mr Peter Giles has been appointed executive chairman and Mr David Dace will
remain on the board as a non-executive director.
In 1992 the group returned pre-tax profits of Pounds 134,000, but for the
half year to June 30 there was a swing from pre-tax profits of Pounds
314,000 to losses of Pounds 425,000.

FT  06 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Richmond chiefs quit to save cash
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Non-executive directors of Richmond Oil &amp; Gas believe the struggling natural
resources company has a viable future, in spite of the resignations of both
its chairman and managing director.
Richmond announced the departure of Mr Robert Fox, the chairman and chief
executive, along with Mr Michael Hogue, managing director, at the same time
as it revealed pre-tax losses for the year to March 31 1993 of Pounds 3.19m,
against Pounds 44.1m, which was struck after provisions of Pounds 38.1m.
Losses per share came out at 3.5p (48p).
Richmond said the results reflected the loss of its main asset, the Richmond
Ranch Properties, to creditors in 1992. This meant the group lost all of its
oil and gas production, reducing turnover from Pounds 11.4m to Pounds 1.64m.
Mr Fox said he and Mr Hogue had stepped down to reduce overheads at the
group, which was short of cash. The board said that in spite of efforts to
reduce costs, the external regulatory and other legal services required were
relatively expensive.
The board is reviewing its plans, including several oil and gas
acquisitions, and said it would inform shareholders about its intentions as
soon as possible.
The plans are subject to the disposal of the San Juan Basin coalbed methane
properties in the US being completed, for which Richmond hopes to receive
about Dollars 5m (Pounds 3.3m).
Shares in Richmond were suspended at 4 1/2 p in October, having come to the
market at 105p in 1989.
Share dealings and transactions relating to the period about the time of the
flotation are under investigation by the Serious Fraud Office.

FT  06 JAN 94 / Banks agree to shore up Banesto
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE and JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Bank of Spain has pressed the country's big banks and savings banks into
opening a Pta300bn (Pounds 1.4bn) line of emergency short-term credit on the
interbank market to help shore up liquidity at Banesto, the struggling
commercial bank whose management was replaced by the authorities last week.
Spanish retail depositors have withdrawn up to Pta250bn from Banesto since
its chairman, Mr Mario Conde, and the rest of his board were dismissed by
the Bank of Spain on December 28. The move came after the central bank's
inspectors found a Pta503bn over-valuation of assets at Spain's fourth
biggest bank.
Mr Luis Angel Rojo, governor of the central bank, met senior executives of
the banks and savings banks on Tuesday, winning agreement from them that the
banks would supply 70 per cent of the credits Banesto needs, with the rest
being supplied by the savings banks.
A representative of one savings bank described the meeting as 'tense',
reflecting unease, particularly among the savings banks, at being forced to
come to the assistance of Banesto. The commercial banks may also be asked
later this year to help recapitalise Banesto with a temporary equity
injection.
The Bank of Spain has undertaken to guarantee loans made through the credit
line to Banesto, which by September last year was Pta504bn in debt in the
interbank market.
Details also emerged yesterday of an earlier attempt by JP Morgan, the US
bank which advised Banesto, to persuade the Bank of Spain that Banesto could
survive under its former management. Morgan's effort was led by Mr Roberto
Mendoza, a Morgan vice-chairman, who also sat on Banesto's board. Morgan
estimated the over-valuation of Banesto's assets at Pta372bn, compared with
the central bank's figure of Pta503bn.
Morgan drew up a plan late in the year to write down Pta265bn of Banesto's
Pta7,000bn assets immediately, using Pta180bn of the bank's capital reserves
and releasing a tax credit of Pta85bn.
According to the intervention document drawn up by the central bank, Morgan
also intended to help Banesto raise up to Pta230bn of fresh capital over the
following 18 months.

FT  06 JAN 94 / Kmart to offer shares in its specialty retail subsidiaries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Kmart, the US retailing giant which is under pressure to revitalise its
flagging financial performance, has announced that restructuring charges
aimed at improving profitability would wipe Dollars 1.3bn (Pounds 877m) off
pre-tax profits in the year to January 26.
The company warned that the effect of the charges, translating into Dollars
850m after tax, would combine with disappointing sales to produce a slump in
earnings to a level 'well below' the previous year's net income of Dollars
941m.
But it tempered the bad news with a plan to sell shares in four of its
specialty retailing subsidiaries in targeted stock offerings, aimed at
realising the hidden value of these relatively small parts of the business.
The group's shares fell Dollars  1/2 to close at Dollars 21.
The Dollars 1.3bn restructuring charge, which comes in addition to
previously announced after-tax charges of Dollars 450m relating to the
disposal of the PACE Membership Warehouse and PayLess Drug Stores
operations, will go mainly towards the cost of closing, relocating or
refurbishing Kmart's discount stores in the US and Canada.
Kmart is already entrenched in a store renewal programme announced in
February 1990, but that plan is now being expanded in an attempt to
invigorate sales.
Mr Joseph Antonini, chairman and chief executive, said discount store
profits fell in 1993 because clothing sales were flat and consumers traded
down to lower-margin goods. In addition, profits at the group's Builders
Square subsidiary were hit by severe storms last winter, the PACE membership
warehouse operation incurred an Dollars 87m operating loss in the first nine
months, and the group suffered a higher interest charge.
As part of the plan to revitalise the group, Kmart will raise cash by
selling shares representing 20-30 per cent of the equity of its four niche
retailing subsidiaries: Builders Square, OfficeMax, The Sports Authority and
Borders-Waldenbrooks.
Kmart's existing shares will become shares in the discount store operation,
with the new shares in each of the four subsidiaries trading separately.
Kmart intends to retain majority stakes in all four companies, at least
initially. The scheme is similar to that used by Ralston Purina, the animal
feed manufacturer, which issued shares in its Continental Baking subsidiary.
Mr Antonini said: 'By focusing on five strong businesses and enhancing our
financial flexibility, Kmart Corporation will be positioned for improved
strategic and financial performance in the highly competitive retail markets
of the 1990s.'

FT  06 JAN 94 / LWT merger strategy collapses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London Weekend Television and Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television will today
announce that their merger talks are off. The move will boost Granada
Group's chances of succeeding in its hostile bid for the London ITV company.
It means that Sir Christopher Bland, the LWT chairman, has failed in his
attempt to put together a quartet of ITV companies - LWT, Yorkshire, Tyne
Tees and Anglia. The short-term aim was that LWT would take over Yorkshire
and Anglia would take over Tyne Tees to comply with broadcasting rules that
prevent one company holding more than two licences. The longer term hope was
that further deregulation would enable the four to come together to form a
'super' ITV company.
All the signs last night were that Anglia, which had a board meeting
yesterday, decided not to go ahead. Anglia's approval was necessary before
detailed negotiations began on price.
The collapse of the strategy - which senior LWT executives saw as a long
shot - is likely to have considerable impact on the future ownership of ITV
companies. Although LWT will now fight on its managerial and programme
making record - next week it will issue a pre-tax profit forecast that could
top Pounds 40m - the battle has now swung towards Granada.
The collapse of the merger talks means that Yorkshire-Tyne Tees could now be
vulnerable to a takeover bid from outside the ITV system. Anglia, too, loses
a potential defensive shield and could be vulnerable to Lord Hollick's MAI
which has made no secret of its ambition to expand in commercial
broadcasting. MAI controls Meridian, the south of England franchise holder.
Granada's share price yesterday gained 18p to close at 539p, making its
paper offer - of six new shares for every five LWT - worth around Pounds
670m, or 647p a share. There is a cash alternative of 528p a share. LWT rose
20p to 626p.
LWT hopes that this week's announcement that the government is reviewing
cross-media ownership rules will strengthen the argument in favour of 'pure'
television companies.
Granada paid Pounds 84m in the summer for a 17.5 per cent stake in LWT and
acceptances of its offer have taken its interest to nearly 20 per cent. The
collapse of one of LWT's defensive strategies eases the pressure on Granada
to 'sweeten' the offer.
Granada last night confirmed that it was in tough negotiations with Unilever
over the company's advertising budget for next year. Last year Unilever
spent around Pounds 11m with Granada.

FT  06 JAN 94 / Buyers may leave Glaxo drug
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Glaxo could suffer a sharp slowdown in sales of its biggest-selling product,
the ulcer treatment Zantac, later this year, according to a survey published
yesterday by Goldman Sachs, the US stock broker.
The survey found that a large majority of healthcare buyers in the US will
'allow or encourage less use of Zantac' after May. The US accounts for half
of Zantac's Pounds 2.2bn a year sales. May sees the expiry of US patents on
one of the drug's main competitors, Tagamet, made by the Anglo-US company
SmithKline Beecham.
After that date the active ingredient of Tagamet can be made by
manufacturers of unbranded generic drugs. Previous examples of drugs leaving
patent protection indicate that prices can fall by up to 90 per cent.
Zantac and Tagamet work on a similar principle, which helps explain why
healthcare buyers would consider a change to save money, even though Zantac
outsells Tagamet by three to one.
Glaxo responded to the survey by saying that sales would not be affected by
'making a cheaper rival cheaper'. But the prospect of healthcare buyers
actively switching to generic Tagamet hurt Glaxo shares, which fell 23p to
693p yesterday.
Goldman Sachs also asked healthcare buyers whether they would allow or
encourage a switch from Zantac's biggest competitor, the much newer Losec,
made by Swedish company Astra. Losec is in a different class of drugs and
less than half of those who responded to the poll thought that Losec sales
would suffer when Tagamet's US patents expired.
Goldman Sachs approached 228 of the biggest healthcare buyers in the US for
its survey - 28 per cent responded.
The broker said that any fall in Zantac sales would not take place 'very
quickly'. Glaxo became the world's second biggest drugs company during the
1980s thanks to Zantac.

FT  06 JAN 94 / Creativity will be brought to earth / A look at far-reaching
proposals to curtail acquisition accounting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'I'll be checking the wheel nuts on my car from now on,' joked Mr David
Tweedie, chairman of the Accounting Standards Board, after unveiling tough
new proposals on the way companies account for acquisitions.
If implemented, the rules will substantially reduce the scope for companies
to manipulate profits by creating generous pre-acquisition provisions in the
balance sheet for items such as stock writedowns and reorganisation charges.
These costs by-pass the profit and loss account of the acquirer, and the
unused provisions can later be released to bolster profits.
Some even argue the new restrictions may reduce the level of acquisition
activity by British companies.
In a frenzy of activity last month, the board issued drafts of three
standards likely to change fundamentally the future shape of financial
reporting: on provisions, capital instruments and goodwill. All three
threaten some of the most favoured weapons filling the arsenal of creative
accountants in the late 1980s.
Mr Tweedie may be given to jovial turns of phrase, but behind the humour
lies serious concern at the abuses of the past - and a recognition that the
battle for reform will be difficult. He describes acquisition provisions as
the 'black hole' of British accounting. 'If I could put one thing right with
accounts this would be it,' he says.
His objection is to what he calls 'big bath' accounting, by which companies
can throw in large provisions supposedly to cover a multitude of future
expenses. These 'fair value adjustments' are placed in the reserves of the
acquirer and can be released to the profit and loss account.
Financial reporting exposure draft 7 (Fred 7) on fair values in acquisition
provisions, issued in December, toughens up the position considerably. It
restricts the scope for excessive write-downs on stock, and forbids
provisions for reorganisation and integration costs or future operating
losses.
Up till now, the scope for widespread use of pre-acquisition provisions has
been plentiful under SSAP 22, the existing accounting standard dealing with
goodwill - the difference between the net asset value and the purchase price
of an acquired business.
A classic instance is cited by Mr Terry Smith, the City analyst, in his book
'Accounting for Growth'. In the year to March 31 1989, all but Pounds 4m of
the Pounds 56m in profits of Coloroll, the collapsed home furnishings
company, came from the release of provisions rather than from its
operations.
'For two to three years after an acquisition it is damned difficult to see
where the profits are coming from,' says Mr Tweedie.
Some tightening up took place under Exposure Draft 53, the non-mandatory
guidance issued by the board's predecessor, the Accounting Standards
Committee, in 1990. It called for a ban on provisions for future earnings,
and far tighter rules on reorganisation expenses.
But the scope for substantial - though not necessarily unjust - provisions
remains. A survey by Company Reporting, the Edinburgh-based accounts
monitoring service, shows that of companies with turnover above Pounds 300m
which made acquisitions during 1991 and 1992, provisions were an average of
35 per cent of the purchase price. The table shows some examples from the
most recent accounts of large companies.
In spite of an expected lull over Christmas, the document on pre-acquisition
provisions has already begun to attract flak.
Mr Allister Wilson, a technical partner with Ernst &amp; Young, the accountancy
firm, says: 'I think the ASB has thrown the baby out with the bathwater.
Clearly there has been wholesale abuse. Perhaps British business has only
got itself to blame.'
He argues for a compromise which would still allow scope for some
reorganisation provisions, in line with generally accepted accounting
standards in the US.
Mr Roger Davis, head of audit at Coopers &amp; Lybrand, argues that
reorganisation expenses are a form of capital expenditure as part of the
purchase price of a company.
Some argue that the proposals may dissuade companies from making
acquisitions. However, Mr Nigel Stapleton, chief financial officer of
Reed-Elsevier and the new chairman of the 100 Group of finance directors of
leading British companies, is doubtful. 'I think this was probably a
necessary area of attention. Most companies look at acquisitions on a
cashflow basis, not for short-term earnings enhancement. Wise readers of
accounts are already looking at figures on a Fred 7 basis.
'There will be a certain amount of beating of drums, but this represents a
sensible move to what is emerging in international accounting standards,' he
says.
The ASB has made some dilutions from its earlier discussion document, which
was issued in April last year, including removal of strict requirements
forbidding any provisions being made within six months of an acquisition.
But it has been unmoved on its principal recommendations, which could be
issued in final version by the end of the year.
If pre-acquisition provisions are not enough, Tweedie warns that more is to
follow. The board is now preparing work on an accounting standard dealing
with the ordinary provisions companies make, which are also open to abuse.

FT  06 JAN 94 / Plan for 24 M-way service areas: Private sector developments
would close gaps in national network
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Proposals for up to 24 more motorway service areas financed and built by the
private sector are due to be announced by the Department of Transport today.
If all gain planning permission and are built, they will represent a 50 per
cent increase on the existing network of 53 service areas. They would fill
many of the lengthy gaps that have been criticised by motorists and motoring
organisations.
The service areas are the first wave to win the approval of the department
after a government decision in August 1992 to remove controls on ownership.
Previously companies in the catering and petrol station sectors had to lease
sites from the government.
The new regime reduces the minimum distance between service areas from 30
miles to 15 and, it is hoped, will lead to a speeding up in the development
of new sites. In the past, motorways such as the M40 between London and
Birmingham and the M11 between London and Cambridge were opened without any
service areas.
With sites costing about Pounds 5m to develop depending on position and
ground conditions, companies such as Granada and Forte, the two leading
operators, can expect to spend at least Pounds 100m on developing the new
sites.
The Automobile Association said it welcomed opening the system of motorway
service areas to private developers. 'Additional service areas will give
tired drivers more opportunities to take a break, reducing the risk of
accidents,' it commented.
However, it warned against a 'mad scramble' for attractive sites, including
those where planning permission was easy to obtain, which would still leave
gaps in more difficult areas.
At least three sites are already under construction, including Cherwell
Valley, on the M40 near Oxford, which is being built by Granada. Forte is
building on sites on the M40 near Warwick and the M11 near Bishop's
Stortford.
A further four sites have obtained planning permission. These are at
Hapsford on the M56 near Chester, Field Farm on the M4 near Reading,
Westenhanger on the M20 near Folkestone and Bowburn on the A1(M) near
Darlington.
Further sites being considered include three on the M25 and two on the M40.

FT  06 JAN 94 / Furore over Italy's new drugs regime may prompt changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Italian cabinet was meeting urgently last night to consider freezing or
substantially changing new rules on medicine sales that have caused
nationwide confusion.
Pharmaceutical companies welcomed the possibility that the legislation might
be altered. The companies have warned that the new rules, introduced at the
weekend, could have devastating effects on some manufacturers. Pharmacists
have also called for immediate action.
Under the original legislation the government's list of free or subsidised
medicines has been revised to cut spiralling medical costs as part of the
1994 budget. Hundreds of previously free drugs have been reclassified and
must now be paid for by customers.
There were angry scenes across the country at chemists' shops, hospitals and
surgeries, after the introduction of the rules on drugs sales.
Many companies, claiming that the changes were pushed through without
adequate consultation by the health ministry, have taken legal action.
The reclassification coincided with the introduction of much tougher
penalties on pharmacists dispensing drugs without prescriptions. Although
Italian law technically requires prescriptions for a wide range of drugs,
many can in fact be bought over the counter in pharmacies without a doctor's
authorisation.
The new rules are designed to bring Italian practice into line with European
Union regulations. The upshot, however, has been to create long queues at
chemists' shops, where patients unaware of the new rules have been turned
away. The Italian pharmacists' association has called for at least a
temporary freeze on the new penalties to allow patients and doctors more
time to adjust to the need for prescriptions.
Pharmacists have urged the government to authorise the use of faxed
prescriptions to reduce the need for return visits to doctors' surgeries.
They have also recommended that patients with chronic illnesses, such as
diabetes, should be given special identification cards, eliminating the need
for repeat prescriptions.
Government officials said yesterday that the new legislation gave drugs
companies the right to appeal, and the new list of approved medicines would
be re-examined if necessary.
On prescriptions, officials said revised rules would be issued soon
extending the range of medicines that could be bought without a doctor's
consent.

FT  06 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Granada/LWT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The failure of the 'quartet' of television companies to make music together
severely impairs LWT's defence strategy. It may also expose Anglia to a bid
and leaves Yorkshire-Tyne Tees' shares looking horribly overvalued. LWT will
now have to rely on its defence that television companies will be re-rated
as industry regulation is relaxed. But rival bidders may already be running
scared of the prices being slapped on the table. Besides, budding media
conglomerates are more likely to want programme copyrights than the right to
run TV franchises.
Granada may try to despatch LWT quickly by pitching in with a higher cash
offer. But it has some fine calculations to make if it does sweeten its
terms. It will prove hard enough to generate sufficient cost savings to
avoid earnings dilution at the bid's current level. A higher offer would
only make the butchery more savage. While Channel 3 franchises may continue
to command scarcity value, they face fairly dull trading prospects.
Intensifying competition threatens to sap the strength of the advertising
upturn. Channel 4 is proving adept at grabbing a bigger slice of the
advertising cake while cable and satellite operators are nibbling away
furiously, too.

FT  06 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Hepworth
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Trustees are much criticised for their passivity in defending investors, so
it is refreshing to see Law Debenture Trust taking the initiative to the
advantage of Hepworth's bondholders. While the company was entitled to force
conversion of its Pounds 100m convertible issue last month, the timing meant
bondholders stood to lose their final interest payment and understandably
felt hard done by. Thanks to a wrinkle in the covenants, though, Law
Debenture was able to convert on their behalf - after the interest payment
date. An unusual purchase facility arranged through Cazenove allowed
bondholders to buy back shares directly from the trustee yesterday rather
than taking their chances in the market.
If the episode signals a new mood of activism among trustees, so much the
better. Increased competition from insurance companies is certainly an
incentive for established trustees to sharpen their act. But it would be
better if similar sticky situations could be avoided in future. Covenants
which make bondholders' entitlements to interest more explicit in such
circumstances would be a good place to start. Ensuring that interest payment
dates fall several weeks before conversion dates might also help avoid
confusion.
Hepworth must have mixed feelings about the operation. The repurchase
facility ensured an orderly market yesterday even though 8 per cent of the
company's enlarged equity changed hands. Law Debenture's intervention will
have pleased shareholders but cost Pounds 3m additional interest. With
gearing falling from over 100 per cent to little more than 10 per cent now
the issue is safely converted, Hepworth can afford to pay that price.

<TEXT>
Today's Bundesbank council meeting faces a difficult decision on interest
rates. Given the further rise in unemployment in December to a
post-reunification high, the economic outlook is hardly encouraging. The 2.1
per cent drop in November industrial production makes it more or less
certain that economic output fell in the fourth 1993 quarter while the 0.8
per cent drop in new orders does not bode well for the first quarter of this
year. Since the Bundesbank seems generally satisfied that inflation is on a
downward course, that would call for a further cut in official rates -
especially since economic recovery could yield productivity gains which
would help keep price rises under control.
Yet the Bundesbank cannot ignore the weakness of both the D-Mark and German
bonds. Germany needs foreign capital to finance a budget deficit that
remains uncomfortably high. At a time when there is talk of a monetary
tightening in the US, the bank may not want to risk a rate cut which could
precipitate further D-Mark weakness. Higher bond yields would then make the
deficit even more expensive to finance.
That calls for some delicate manoeuvring. The bank could leave the discount
rate unchanged and simply cut its money market repurchase rate. But, at 25
basis points, the gap between the two rates is already small. Such a move
would leave expectations of a discount rate cut later this month at fever
pitch, so the D-Mark would probably weaken anyway. A better solution might
be for the bank to get the discount rate cut out of the way now and use its
repurchase operations to signal that money market rates will be allowed to
catch up only slowly.

FT  06 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Kmart's store of trouble
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Kmart's disappointing earnings record over the past five years certainly
demonstrates the need for management action. Yet its 1990 restructuring plan
has clearly proved insufficiently bold to rejuvenate the company's fortunes
and help it catch its arch-rival Wal-Mart. Yesterday's announcement of
further store relocations and refurbishments, and the partial flotation of
several specialist chains to help pay for it, is an attempt to tackle some
of the problems. Many of Kmart's main discount stores remain too small and
badly located to compete effectively against Wal-Mart. Its distribution
network is also inferior to Wal-Mart's which boasts technological
innovations such as satellite location of its supply lorries and
three-dimensional bar coding of goods by product and destination.
But perhaps Wal-Mart's decisive advantage has been its devolved decision
making and close integration with local communities. That has established it
as the natural local store to visit - an image which Kmart will now find it
hard to change. By contrast, Kmart's attempts to cluster its speciality
sports equipment, books and office supplies shops around a spruced up Kmart
store risks sending a confused and over-complex message to consumers. Some
of the speciality retailing operations are good, but Kmart's involvement
looks increasingly irrelevant. Kmart's share rating is now barely a third of
Wal-Mart's. Full demerger and an overhaul of all aspects of the discount
chain may be the only way to close part of the gap.

FT  06 JAN 94 / Greece snubs EU over Macedonia: Brussels fears refusal to
recognise republic may provoke border crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ATHENS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Greece, which this week took over the presidency of the European Union,
refused yesterday to join its partners in recognising the former Yugoslav
republic of Macedonia.
Its resistance clouded hopes of a renewed effort to end the fighting in
Bosnia, and of the EU developing a common foreign and security policy.
Mr Andreas Papandreou, the Greek prime minister, refused to rule out closing
his country's frontier with Macedonia, raising the threat of a border crisis
while Athens is at the EU helm. Greece holds the rotating EU presidency
until July.
After a meeting in Athens with the European Commission to set EU policy
priorities for the six months, Mr Papandreou said 'it is not our intention
today to close the frontier' with Macedonia. But he warned that Athens
reserved its options and that Macedonia was dependent on Greece and the
Greek port of Thessaloniki for most of its trade.
Greece believes that the former Yugoslav Macedonia - which it refers to as
Skopje, the republic's capital - is making a territorial claim on the Greek
province of Macedonia, by virtue of its choice of name, its constitution and
its flag, which bears an ancient Macedonian dynastic emblem discovered in
1975 in northern Greece.
'For us this is a kind of irredentism, and what is more, a territorial
claim,' Mr Papandreou said. 'You cannot have neighbours threatening to
liberate your territory.'
Greece's partners have grown increasingly irritated with Athens' attempts to
block EU recognition of Macedonia, which several governments have likened to
Greek obstruction of closer links with Turkey because of the Turkish
occupation of part of Cyprus.
Five member states - the UK, Germany, France, the Netherlands and Denmark -
announced full diplomatic relations with Macedonia just before Greece took
over the EU presidency.
The depth of Greek feeling, shared by the government, opposition and public
opinion, was reflected by Mr Theodoros Pangalos, the Greek European affairs
minister who now chairs the Council of Ministers of the EU.
'You want us to love the people who hate us,' Mr Pangalos told journalists.
'Of course they hate us; does the IRA hate Britain? These people are
claiming half my country.'
Mr Pangalos said the Skopje government had to guarantee to respect Greece's
border, while Mr Papandreou hoped that those of his partners who had
recognised Macedonia 'will exert influence on them and not only on us'.
Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, steered well clear of the
Macedonian controversy, in spite of fears in Brussels and member state
capitals that it might provoke a fresh EU crisis.
But he appealed in Athens for a 'realistic . . . strategic view of Turkey's
importance' to a frustrated EU policy, which sees Ankara as a political and
commercial hub both in the eastern Mediterranean and for the central Asian
republics of the former Soviet Union.
Mr Papandreou defended Greece's blocking of Ecu400m (Pounds 315m) in aid to
Turkey, as well as its resistance to Ankara's EU membership application. 'We
cannot forget that there is a Turkish occupation of Cyprus after an
invasion,' he said.

If your ambition is to hobnob with City bigwigs, attend lots of banquets and
ride the best police horses in the Lord Mayor's show, hard luck. It sounds
as if the job of commissioner of the City of London Police has been filled.
Bill Taylor, 47, an assistant commissioner at Scotland Yard, appears to have
beaten Colin Coxall, the acting commissioner of the City police, to a post
which has been empty since Owen Kelly retired unexpectedly early.
Taylor will get more than Pounds 50m a year to police the Square Mile, so he
need never worry about having to cancel Royal visits because of a shortage
of funds. And given that reported crime in the City was 10 per cent down in
1992 compared with a 6 per cent rise across the nation, his bobbies should
have plenty of time to capitalise on their success in tracking down
fraudsters.
Not that the City is free of traditional crime. Commander Hugh Moore, the
respected number three in the City police, died last month, less than a
fortnight after being mugged by a man he was trying to arrest in Old Jewry,
near the force's headquarters.

No wonder Jim Payne, one of the best-known souls in the Lloyd's reinsurance
market, has opted to step down as vice-chairman of Sedgwick Group in March.
For where is he to effect his business? To the best of Observer's knowledge,
nothing dreadful has happened to his immediate surroundings at Sedgwick
Payne, where he was chairman until the end of last year. But his
hairdresser, Parkes, something of an institution just around the corner from
Lloyd's, has caught the Lime Street blight and shut up shop.
This is significant because Payne has been known, when up against a deadline
and unable to raise a particularly crucial underwriter at his desk, to rush
into the barber's brandishing a piece of paper to secure the vital signature
on the multi-million risk between snips.

Being hounded from office for extramarital activities is not necessarily a
disaster. Although Tim Yeo will find circumstances a little tougher from the
loss of his Pounds 51,402 salary as minister of state for the environment,
he can of course still bank upon his MP's salary of Pounds 31,687.
He could also take a leaf out of David Mellor's book. The former heritage
minister was given sharp handling by a media pack more interested in
personal muck-raking than digging deeper into the financial and political
Westminster miasmas.
Mellor's response? To build a thriving career as an arts columnist for The
Guardian and occasional - and well paid - pundit for some parts of the very
pack which once snapped at his heels. Yeo may yet pick up the pieces and
some cheques - perhaps as golf writer for one of the tabloids.

international prominence with mixed feelings. Both predecessors, France's
Philippe Morillon and Belgium's Francis Briquemont got into deep water by
taking a high public profile. The latter is leaving after complaining about
having too few troops and being hounded by bureaucracy.
Sir Michael, 53, currently commanding the UK Field Army, may well be more
discreet. Like Britain's Gulf war commander, Sir Peter de la Billiere, the
new man is a former special forces chief. During his time in the SAS he was
awarded the Queen's Gallantry Medal. But what for, the army felt unable to
say.

FT  06 JAN 94 / Observer: Standard of criticism
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Strange goings on at the Evening Standard. Yesterday's first edition carried
a stirring feature by Stephen Fay, a well-known financial journalist, on why
it was a tragedy that Paul Newall, the new Lord Mayor of London, had not
picked up the customary knighthood. The City of London PR machine admitted
it could not have written a better piece itself.
Hence some surprise when later editions carried a hurriedly rewritten
feature under the same headline, 'Turn again Mr Major and give this man a
knighthood', by an unknown James Watson. The paper's switchboard had never
heard of him.
The arguments were much the same and the only real difference was the
conclusion. The mysterious Watson, who is understood to moonlight as editor
of London's evening paper, did not support Fay's conclusion that future Lord
Mayors should 'cancel the trumpets, cross the prime minister's name off the
guest list for the next Guildhall dinner, and let Mr Major find a more
humble venue to tell us about the state of the nation'.
Pity. Observer has always felt that it would be far healthier if London's
monopoly on these state of the nation events was broken. Why doesn't John
Major let Glasgow, Manchester and Birmingham have a go at staging the
equivalent of the Mansion House/Guildhall dinners? It would do wonders for
the morale of the regions.

FT  06 JAN 94 / Struggle to square the Arctic circle: The chilly reception
in northern Scandinavia for potential European Union membership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Descending in a clatter of helicopters and attended by a pack of
journalists, Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, paid a
visit to Irene and Ulf Johansson's dairy farm to see what agricultural life
is like close to the Arctic Circle.
'He asked us about the subsidies we get and he visited the cow shed,'
recalled Irene. 'He said farmers in the French mountains also have
problems.' She paused for a moment. 'But I don't think it is as hard as it
is here.'
She is surely right. When Mr Delors visited last spring, the ground at
Lillkorstrask, in Sweden's northernmost county of Norrbotten, was still
thick with snow. The little rough barley the Johanssons grow for cattle feed
cannot be sown until the end of May. The growing season is about 130 days,
half its length in southern Sweden or Denmark. By midwinter, when there are
fewer than four hours of light a day, the temperature can fall below minus
20'C.
What keeps farmers like the Johanssons going are government subsidies, in
their case for milk, accounting for about one-third of the farm's income.
Despite Mr Delors' visit, Irene and Ulf are suspicious that Swedish
membership of the European Union would mean a cut in subsidies and would
undermine the support Stockholm has traditionally pumped into Sweden's
remote northern regions.
As 1994 opens, the worries of people like the Johanssons loom large in the
minds of ministers in Stockholm, Oslo and Helsinki. Along with Austria, a
fellow member of the European Free Trade Area, the governments of Sweden,
Norway and Finland must persuade their sceptical electorates to vote for
entry to the EU in referendums if their applications for membership are to
succeed. The aim is to join by January 1 1995 if possible - and if not, at
least in time to participate in the EU's next intergovernmental conference
on the future shape of the Union in 1996.
The EU has set March 1 as the deadline for completing accession agreements
now being negotiated with the four Efta applicants. If the timetable is
adhered to, the four will schedule referendums for later in the year.
Pulling off this latest round of enlargement, as the process is called, is
scarcely less important to the EU itself than to the individual applicants.
The 12 existing members have committed themselves at successive summits to
bringing the Efta four into the Union.
Among the applicants, the issues of contention vary from country to country
 -and extend far beyond the question of support for Alpine, Arctic and
sub-Arctic farmers. But as far as Sweden is concerned, Norrbotten offers a
distillation of the opposition to membership. The latest opinion polls in
the country's northernmost county show just 13 per cent in favour of
membership, with 55 per cent against. This compares with national figures of
between 25 and 30 per cent for membership and 45 to 48 per cent against.
If Swedes as a whole tend to feel at one remove, geographically and
philosophically, from the rest of Europe, the 264,000 people who live in
Norrbotten, 700km north of Stockholm, feel even more so.
The EU is prepared to put Norrbotten in its highest category of
qualification for regional aid, because of unemployment above the national
average of 14 per cent, the climate and the structural disadvantage of the
long distances within the region and from the rest of the Union. But this
has apparently made little impression in the county. As in the rest of the
country, there is a feeling that Union membership will further erode
traditional Swedish egalitarian policies towards disadvantaged groups and
regions, already squeezed by three years of hard recession.
'We in the north of Sweden are going to be forgotten,' says Morten Eriksson,
a final-year high-school student at Hermelinsskolan in Lulea, the county
capital. 'We won't mean much to the European Union.' A show of hands among
22 of Morten's classmates - who will be eligible to vote in the referendum -
revealed none in favour and eight against. If any of the remaining 14 were
leaning towards a 'Yes' vote, they were not prepared to admit it.
'No' and 'Yes' campaigners alike say that a feeling that the Swedish way of
life is threatened by Union membership underlies much of the opposition
across the country. Ursula Berge, political editor of Norrlandska
Socialdemocraten, the opposition Social Democratic party's newspaper in the
region, says: 'Opposition to the EU is about Swedish neutrality and our
independent foreign policy, it is about equality between men and women, it
is about unemployment, about regional questions and it is about Swedish
sovereignty.' The newspaper opposes the SDP's pro-EU stance.
In the minds of many, Ms Berge says, the recession and the unprecedented
levels of unemployment are at least partially caused by the country's
market-oriented policies which are designed to harmonise the economy with
the Union. 'We had very low unemployment for years - because of our
economic, social and employment policies. It worked and people still think
that it is possible to make it work again.'
Just before Christmas, the right-centre government of Prime Minister Carl
Bildt - as well as the opposition Social Democratic leadership - claimed a
big victory in the accession agreement negotiations with Brussels. Sweden
was allowed to keep its tough environmental regulations and its state
monopoly on the sale of alcohol, and to escape an EU ban on the sale of
'snus', the orally-taken wet snuff popular among Swedes.
These concessions were presented by the government and the Social Democratic
leaders as evidence that the Union was not intent on remoulding Swedish
society. If similarly favourable agreements are struck in the coming months
on support for farmers and the regions, then the political establishment in
Stockholm may find opinion easier to swing in favour of membership.
Farmers Irene and Ulf Johansson, for example, say their initial
determination to vote 'No' has been softened by concern that Sweden could be
left isolated, especially if Finland or Norway decides to join the Union.
'The level of subsidies will be the decisive issue for us,' says Irene.
But a handicap for the 'Yes' campaign is the lack of concrete advantages it
can hold out for membership. Neither government nor industry, which is
overwhelmingly in favour, pretends membership will suddenly boost the
economy - especially as Sweden already enjoys most of the economic fruits of
the Union through its membership of the European Economic Area.
The gist of the 'Yes' campaign is the rather defensive line that Sweden
would be better off inside the Union, where it can wield some influence on
policy, than outside, where it has no influence and where it may lose out on
investment.
At least until there is a significant economic upturn, Swedes are reluctant
to embrace grand new schemes which lead away from the certainties of the
past, even if those certainties have been shaken. Examples of such feeling
include the rebellion against car and truckmaker Volvo's plan to merge with
France's Renault - fuelled to a significant degree by reluctance to see the
symbol of Swedish manufacturing fall under foreign control - and nagging
opposition to building a road and rail bridge to Denmark, the first fixed
link between Sweden and the European mainland.
'After what has happened in Sweden over the last few years, people are
inclined to say 'No' to everything,' says Mr Jan-Erik Bergmark, a senior
executive at SSAB, the steel company with a big mill in Lulea. 'The economy,
employment - these are not going up yet. People are tired and when you are
tired you tend to say 'No' to new things.'
It may be that the mood can be swung around. An economic recovery,
anticipated this year, might make Swedes confident that their country would
be strong enough to make its voice heard in a Union of 16. An accession
agreement largely meeting Swedish concerns would help reverse the bleak
image the EU has at present. EU supporters point out that opinion polls
showed a majority in favour of membership less than two years ago. But in
the dead of dark winter in Norrbotten, the heartland of opposition, signs of
a thaw in opinion are hard to find.

FT  06 JAN 94 / Leading Article: Bank of France on its own
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The independence of the Bank of France, promoted by both the conservative
Paris government and its Socialist predecessor, was enshrined in law towards
the end of last year. It will take time for the financial markets to accept
that French ministers really have handed control over interest rates to the
bank's nine-strong monetary committee, the six outside members of which were
named yesterday. It may take longer still for the perceived advantages of
central banking independence - establishment of conditions for low-inflation
growth - to become fully apparent to the French public. However,
independence marks an important further step strengthening French economic
policies after the summer debacle in the exchange rate mechanism.
No central bank can run policies totally free of constraints set by the
society in which it operates. The independent Bundesbank has provided a
model for some of the legislation enacted in Paris. Yet the German central
bank has relied in its anti-inflation efforts far less on its legal
protection from political influence than on the strong German consensus in
favour of price stability. This consensus is tested above all at times of
crisis. The Bundesbank has frequently made decisions which have contributed
to the unpopularity of the government in power, and, on occasion, to its
downfall.
By bringing to the Bank of France council qualified outsiders from diverse
backgrounds, the government has increased the chances that its actions will
be both wise and respected. However, in the long run, the bank's statutes
will prove effective only if the French people remain convinced of the
merits of anti-inflation policies. Despite the summer setbacks, cross-party
support in Paris for the strong franc strategy practised for 10 years
remains intact. In view of recession and rising unemployment, backing for a
firm franc may, however, fade as eyes start to fix on the 1995 presidential
elections.
The Bundesbank built up its reputation for toughness during a 10-year period
after 1948 when the D-Mark was not fully convertible and foreigners had low
expectations of German monetary policy. The conditions under which the Bank
of France has to defend its new status are in some ways much more testing.
In particular, the bank must confront an uncomfortable paradox. To maintain
policy credibility - and to try to inch French interest rates below German
ones - the French government and central bank have to maintain a public
display of agreement. The best opportunity for the Bank of France to make a
convincing demonstration of its independence would be offered by a monetary
crisis. But this is a development that the French authorities are
understandably anxious to avoid. A significant reason for the move to make
the Bank of France independent is to lower the influence over French
interest rates at present exercised by the Bundesbank. The goal is worth
fighting for. But the struggle has only just begun.

FT  06 JAN 94 / Leading Article Education reform
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Ron Dearing's final report on the national curriculum and its assessment
will be judged in the short term by the extent to which his recommendations
restore good order in English schools. Opposition by teachers to plans for
the compulsory testing of 14-year-olds last summer blew the government's
education reforms off course. Early indications are that the Dearing report
will be enough to win back the co-operation of the moderate teachers'
unions.
In the longer term, however, Sir Ron's recommendations must be judged by the
extent to which they preserve the basic principles of the government's
reforms. The national curriculum survives, slimmed down to occupy no more
than 80 per cent of school time for most children. It will be more closely
focused on the basics of literacy, oracy and numeracy. Some critics will be
disappointed that the core curriculum has not been scaled back even more.
However, Sir Ron's proposals give teachers increased discretion over the
content of the school day.
Compulsory testing also survives, though simplified and limited to the core
subjects of English, mathematics and science. Reductions are also to be made
in the number of attainment targets, the profusion of which has multiplied
paperwork for teachers. With testing now focusing only on the three core
subjects, monitoring progress on non-core subjects will be left to teacher
assessment. There is a danger that this could leave parents in the dark over
their children's performance in these subjects until a system of comparing
teacher assessments can be established.
These changes have been introduced with the aim of winning over all but the
most implacable opponents of the government's education reforms. But Sir Ron
has gone further in his recommendation that schools should be allowed to
offer 14-16-year-olds a wider range of vocational subjects. For these
children, he suggests that the time spent on the core curriculum could be
reduced to 60 per cent so that they can develop their interests and
preferences.
In principle, this is an excellent idea. More practical and work-oriented
courses can engage and motivate children who are not making good progress in
a wholly academic curriculum. They can also help such children develop work
practices and competences which will equip them for the fast-changing world
of work.
However, such courses need to be carefully thought out, adequately resourced
and taught by properly trained teachers. They must also avoid being too
narrowly work-specific, an accusation made by critics of the new national
vocational qualifications for people in training. Sir Ron rightly says that
he expects the development of proper courses to take some years. The
creation of vocational and technical dimensions in English schools has
already been botched once since the last war. The same mistake must not be
made again.

FT  06 JAN 94 / Leading Article: Private affairs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain is not a theocracy. Personal relationships are, or should be, a
matter for the individual conscience, guided, where appropriate, by church
or mosque. The government should think hard before intervening. It
traditionally sustains contracts, such as marriages. It must protect the
vulnerable, as it is attempting to do by chasing fathers for maintenance
payments through the Child Support Agency. It has a duty to consider the
public expenditure consequences of any particular action, as when it reviews
payments to single parents. Beyond that, it should shut up.
Mr Tim Yeo, a capable junior minister, has fallen victim to the
Conservatives' failure to recognise the limitations of what the state can
usefully say about private behaviour. Since last autumn a number of
ministers have babbled about family values and morality as if they were
something more than politicians. The public perception that a moral crusade
has been launched is partly the result of careless speeches on subjects that
have not been properly thought through. It is also a consequence of the
prime minister's desperate search for a theme that could unify his party.
Rightwing ayatollahs shamelessly preached the virtues of family life at the
Tory conference in Blackpool last October. Were there no adulterers in the
hall?
Since then, the slogan 'back to basics', dusted and refurbished in Downing
Street, has further confused matters. The purpose may have been to encompass
more rigorous teaching methods and a new strategy for the control of crime,
but the effect was to introduce an atmosphere of fundamentalism into British
political discourse. This is consonant with English history, which is
punctuated by fits of ersatz morality. The present example is a sorry
indication of the lengths to which an unpopular government will go in an
effort to restore its fortunes. The effect on Mr Yeo's constituency officers
was predictable. They indicated that they wanted him to resign as a
minister, which would punish him for his adultery, but not as a member of
parliament, which might cost the Conservatives the seat. Moral gestures have
their boundaries.
Coming from a party that cast down, then took up again, Lord Parkinson this
is piquant. From a government that flies the flag of individual freedom it
is particularly curious. Since 1979 successive Conservative administrations
have promised less regulation, less governance, more space for individual
enterprise and initiative. Today it is even making instant pronouncements on
such tortuous subjects as the correct age at which a woman may be assisted
by her doctor to have a baby. That too is a moral issue, best left to
theologians and philosophers. The Conservatives should think again about the
meaning of 'family values' and 'back to basics'. In the age of
privatisation, the greatest absurdity would be to nationalise morality.

FT  06 JAN 94 / Personal View: UK's wrong turning on training
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID SOSKICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK government has recently given two important clues to future policy
directions on the links between education and training. First, it is
launching a new apprenticeship scheme. Second, it is cutting the number of
entrants to higher education this year by 3.5 per cent. There are good
reasons for believing this is the wrong direction for the UK to be taking.
During the last decade, a series of studies comparing vocational training in
the UK and other economies has made clear how limited a role UK companies
played in the provision of effective initial vocational training for
school-leavers.
The central problem has been a failure to understand the institutional
preconditions required for the private sector to be heavily involved in the
initial training of young people. In all the advanced economies in which the
private sector plays a central role in such training (the Scandinavian
economies, Austria, Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Japan), there
are strong and binding traditions of co-operation between companies and in
long-term links between companies and banks. These 'deep structures' of
capitalism allow four things to happen which are necessary to persuade
companies to commit serious resources to initial training:
1. Wage competition between companies is 'managed', so companies do not fear
that the employees they have trained will be poached. 2. Companies deal
directly with highly resourced employer organisations (in which they have
confidence) over the setting up, updating, monitoring and administration of
training programmes. They do not have to deal directly with public training
agencies (which they are likely in principle to distrust).
3. They have access to long-term finance.
4. With powerful employer organisations behind them, companies are prepared
to allow unions an important role in both training policy-making and in
day-to-day involvement.
British companies have none of these advantages. They can rely neither on
non-market co-ordination with other companies, nor on long-term links with
banks. Any attempt to develop an effective system of vocational training in
the UK is thus unlikely to be successful.
Different 'systems' of capitalism, however, have different institutional
comparative advantages. In a quite different area from vocational training,
big changes have been occurring in the link between education and the UK
economy. These changes are similar to, but lag behind, what has been
happening in the US where, in the last decade or so, there appears to have
been a radical change in the nature of skills required. This is especially
so in the service sectors, where the skills that are increasingly in demand
are not the type taught in vocational training, but are social,
organisational and computing skills.
The route to social skills is the education system, but with academic
quality of education mattering less than prolonged immersion in an
environment in which communication with peers and self-organisation is
important. The US, with more than 55 per cent of young people going into
some form of higher education, has the educational pool which has been able
to meet the demand for this type of labour force. Productivity in the US is
still significantly greater than in Germany and Japan, and greater again
than in the UK. Since this largely now reflects the performance of the US
service sector, the mass higher education road is a potentially attractive
one for Britain to go down.
The big changes in the UK appear to reflect the early stages of just such a
direction. Preliminary results of the recent large-scale Employment in
Britain Survey attach particular importance to social skills, suggesting a
widespread increase in the demand for 'higher social skills, for instance
with respect to communication and handling people', and to computing skills.
Equally significant is the near doubling of the proportion of young people
going on from school to higher education. This can be partially explained by
the pressure of government education policies. But it is hard to resist the
conclusion that the driving force is the changing nature of skill
requirements. So it is difficult to understand why the government is braking
the expansion of higher education, and re-emphasising apprenticeships.

FT  06 JAN 94 / Economic Viewpoint: The spectre that is haunting Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Marx and Engels began their celebrated Communist Manifesto of 1848 with the
resounding words: 'A spectre is haunting Europe - the spectre of communism.'
Communism may have gone. But a different economic spectre is haunting the
west. It is one known by the less resounding title of 'the factor price
equalisation theorem'.
To appreciate what this is all about we need to go back to the fundamental
proposition of international trade theory and indeed of all economics. It is
that voluntary exchange makes both sides better off. Otherwise the exchanges
would not take place. The proposition has been known for over 200 years, at
least since Adam Smith. The rest is elaboration.
Part of this elaboration has, however, been casting a shadow over the free
trade case for the last 70 years or so. For in the 1920s a 'theorem' was
promulgated by the Swedish economist and statesman Bertil Ohlin known as
'factor price equalisation'. A 'factor' is what a businessman would call an
input. Trade economists tend to group these inputs into very broad
categories, such as capital, land, skilled and unskilled labour.
The modern statement of the theorem is due to the Nobel Prize winning
economist, Paul Samuelson. It asserts what many practical men have long
supposed: that when available production techniques are similar, transport
costs are low, and several other conditions are met, the earnings of
'factors' in different countries will tend to equality under free trade. For
instance, wages of unskilled labour in the US will fall and unskilled labour
in India and China rise towards a common level.
During the golden age of the 1950s, 1960s and early 1970s there was much
arid armchair discussion of the assumptions under which factor price
equalisation held and how likely they were to be fulfilled. (The interested
reader will find the key arguments in, for instance, the 1969 Penguin
International Trade Selected Readings, and in Max Corden's International
Trade Theory and Policy, Edward Elgar, 1992). Meanwhile, trade was being
liberalised and expanded and real pay was rising in the industrial west.
But with the stagnation in US blue-collar wages of the 1980s, and the rise
in European unemployment, factor price equalisation entered the world of
policy argument. Indeed, in another echo of Karl Marx, some economists have
been reminded of his theory of the immiseration (growing poverty) of the
proletariat. An American economist of uncompromising pro-free trade views,
Jagdish Bhagwati, subtitled a recent co-authored paper (available from the
American Enterprise Institute) 'Is Marx striking again?' A well-known
British economic consultant, Douglas McWilliams, has called a recent lecture
'Perhaps Marx was right after all'.
Paul Samuelson himself, lecturing in Italy in 1992, remarked with cautious
alarmism: 'As the billions of people who live in east Asia and Latin America
qualify for good, modern jobs, the half-billion Europeans and North
Americans who used to tower over the rest of the world will find their
upward progress in living standards encountering tough resistance.'
Nevertheless, a person's younger self is often wiser, and I found more
helpful a statement Samuelson made 51 years before: 'It has been shown that
the harm which free trade inflicts upon one factor of production is
necessarily less than the gain to the other. Hence, it is always possible to
bribe the suffering factor by subsidy or other redistributive devices so as
to leave all factors better off as a result of trade.' This, indeed, would
also be my own 'executive summary' of the whole discussion.
Is freer trade, however, really depressing the pay of an important section
of workers in the west? Average real hourly earnings of all US private
sector workers fell between 1979 and 1989 from Dollars 8.17 (in dollars of
1982 purchasing power) to Dollars 7.45. Even allowing for fringe benefits,
and taking in the self-employed, they virtually stagnated (rising by an
average of  1/2 per cent per annum). The dispersion between high and
low-paid workers has increased to levels greater than anything seen since
1940. In the same period the differential earnings of college graduates
increased by 30 per cent relative to those with only high-school education.
Worst of all, the real hourly wages of young males with 12 or fewer years of
schooling dropped in absolute terms by 20 per cent.
The same pressures that have expressed themselves in the US in pay
stagnation have come to the surface in Europe in unemployment and
non-employment (that is workers who have left the official labour force). In
the UK both symptoms can be found, as detailed by Edward Balls in his
contribution to the booklet Work and Welfare (published by the Institute of
Public Policy Research).
His view is that developing country exports still account for too small a
proportion of manufacturing sales in the west to explain the downward
pressure on unskilled wages. Bhagwati also dismisses scare stories about
cheap foreign imports depressing the pay of unskilled workers in the US. For
the same influences should also depress prices of US imports and domestic
substitutes for imports, relative to prices in general; there is no sign of
this.
Bhagwati's explanation is 'skill-based technical change' mainly of domestic
origin. Technical change, he suggests, has been focused more than in the
past on the sectors needing high skills. Trade may, however, have an
indirect effect here. For it makes production footloose and small cost
changes can cause production to migrate between countries. This results in
more labour turnover and less training effort. Other sources of pressure
include the effect of import pressure in eroding the differentially high
wages obtained by unions in industries such as cars and steel.
But whatever the position in the past, international trade movements could
well impose pressures on pay levels in future. McWilliams suggests that real
hourly labour costs in Europe are likely to decline by over 1 per cent per
annum over the next quarter century. He argues that a combination of
population growth and spreading literacy will expand the world's labour
force - skilled as wells unskilled - from 600m at present to around 4bn in
25 years. Thus labour will become very plentiful and capital extremely
scarce.
But there are countervailing factors. If real pay in the developing and
former communist countries remains low relative to productivity, as
McWilliams postulates, then there must be one of two consequences. There
could be a rise in the real exchange rates of these countries, thus
dampening their competitive edge. Alternatively, they will accumulate vast
export surpluses which can be used to finance the required increases in the
world capital stock. This investment in itself will be a source of demand
for the products and labour force of the old, as well as of the new,
industrial countries.
The implications for policy are indeed not very different whether the
downward pressures on labour demand come from imports or from indigenous
change. A familiar response is the call for more education and training.
There is also the need for more sensitive social security arrangements which
will encourage people to stay in the labour market even on low or part-time
pay.
But so far the debate is very incomplete. Much more analysis is required of
likely pay trends in developing and former communist countries and how they
are likely to spend their growing export proceeds. If this were done, their
emergence into the world economy may seem less of a threat and more of an
opportunity than it does at present.

FT  06 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Mechanisms for unitary councils
already in two-tier system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mrs M P CASE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Martin Easteal, chief executive of the Local Government Commission,
described his vision (Letters, December 29) of the outcome of the
commission's local government review - 'a structure that will ensure local
government in the future meets the needs of the community in such a way that
many of the functions now undertaken by quangos may instead become the
responsibility of local authorities'.
That future is not equally envisioned by ministers who are hardly likely to
concur with the implied undermining of major Conservative restructuring in
the fields of, for example, health, education and waste management. There,
power and responsibility have been passed to trusts, to parents and
teachers, to companies at arm's length from, and more commercially driven
than, local councils.
Moreover, on the ground in the shires, notably in my own county, the
preferred option being urged by the lead commissioner, namely the creation
of aggregations of districts, ostensibly unitary, is already necessitating
proposals for the establishment of a range of joint strategic authorities.
They include transportation and planning, and joint boards for police, fire,
magistrates, probation etc.
Specialist areas in childcare, and the education of children with learning
difficulties, are to be handled by agencies; county archives, the Lord
Lieutenancy and other functions will be managed by different 'lead'
authorities.
Surely all of these mechanisms are as dispersed and distanced from the new
unitary council concept as the apparently despised quangos.
How can a system be sufficiently resilient to take over the roles of quango,
and yet require the creation of manifold bodies to facilitate anew the
combination of strategic thinking and local delivery which are the hallmark
of the present two-tier system in many parts of England?

THE NEW MIDDLE EAST By Shimon Peres with Arye Naor Element. 224 pages.
Pounds 16.99
Mr Shimon Peres, Israel's foreign minister, has had a busy, successful year
and is obviously in celebratory mood. On the eve of his 70th birthday in
Norway he completed the negotiations with the Palestine Liberation
Organisation which, on September 13, brought him to the White House lawn for
the historic signing of the declaration of principles.
Now, even before the two sides have agreed on the first stage implementation
of that outline agreement, Mr Peres has sketched out an extraordinary vision
of what peace could mean to the region. 'The world has more money than
ideas. The new Middle East is an idea whose time has come,' he declares.
Both propositions deserve to be treated with the deepest scepticism. But so,
only a few months ago, would the suggestion that Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO
chairman, was about to shake the hand of Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the prime
minister of Israel. Mr Peres's part in making that breakthrough possible
gives him more justification than most for adopting the role of visionary,
even though rather more residents of the Middle East would be tempted to
characterise his musings as verging on fantasy.
With negotiations still so delicately poised, it was probably unrealistic to
expect Mr Peres to provide much detail on the process which led to the
Israel-PLO agreement. His account is impressionistic, imprecise on timing,
but peppered with useful interpretations of Israeli and Palestinian
motivation, particularly that of Mr Arafat.
He views the Palestinian leader as a man determined, above all else, to
retain control of the PLO. Any agreement reached without Mr Arafat's
personal involvement would have eroded his authority. So, according to Mr
Peres, every time the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations in Washington looked
as if they were making progress, Mr Arafat would issue instructions that
blocked further movement. Meanwhile the real work was being done in Norway,
with the great advantage for Israel of not needing to acknowledge Mr
Arafat's ultimate auth-ority until after a deal was struck.
But that, too, may have been one of the flaws in the agreement. Mr Arafat's
autocratic behaviour, then and now, has cost him valuable support within the
PLO, while also delaying the creation of procedures and administrative
structures which are urgently needed if the Palestinians are to assume
greater control over their own affairs in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. At
the same time it is increasingly obvious that Mr Arafat's interpretation of
the dec-laration of principles is seriously at odds with that of Mr Peres.
This makes it all the more difficult to be carried along by Mr Peres's
vision of a Middle East developing on similar lines to Nafta, Asean or the
European Union. The conceptual leap is just too vast to be contemplated by
anyone with much experience of the Arab world. An Israel-Palestinian deal,
still five years from consummation even if all progresses smoothly, is just
one element in a complex mosaic of issues and relationships over which
Israel has little or no influence.
Mr Peres says that Israel cannot dictate the conditions for peace, but he
should also recognise that for many Arabs the present moves towards a
settlement are the final confirmation of their failure.
While it may be his finest moment, it is their acknowledgement that the
struggle of the past four decades has proved largely fruitless. Israel's
continued determination to prevent the creation of an independent
Palestinian state, and to retain full control over Jerusalem, is a powerful
reaffirmation of its regional dominance.
Against such a background, Mr Peres suggests that the Arab oil-producing
countries should donate 1 per cent of their revenues towards regional
development that would stretch from Eritrea and Yemen, through the Gulf to
Egypt, Lebanon, Syria and, of course, Israel. New trans-national motorways
would be built, ports shared, water piped, canals constructed, oil
distributed, the Hijaz rail-way reopened, deserts turned from brown to green
and, even more fancifully, dictatorships transformed into democracies.
To support his argument, Mr Peres cites what has happened in Egypt since it
made peace with Israel. Cairo and Alexandria, he claims, have been
transformed beyond recognition in the past decade, and President Hosni
Mubarak is likely to go down in history as one of the great builders of
Egypt. Even those with the deepest attachment to Egypt and its leader might
have difficulty in recognising Mr Peres's description, which typifies an
endemic problem for Israelis whose received perceptions of their Middle
Eastern neighbours inevitably far outweigh their personal experience.
Mr Peres might do well to listen to his deputy, Mr Yossi Beilin, who told
Palestinians recently that, if they genuinely feared Israel wanted to
dominate them economically, he would prefer to drop all further talk of
closer links between the economies.
There might, just, be a brighter economic and political future ahead for
countries in the Middle East, but it must be remembered that they include
Iran, Iraq, Algeria, Sudan and Libya, and a raft of others with problems
almost as grave.
If Israel is able finally to conclude peace treaties acceptable to its
neighbours, it would represent a significant contribution to Middle East
stability. But beyond that, the countries in the region will go to heaven,
or to hell, in their own way. Mr Peres has already left a personal mark on
the history of the region and should be wary of damaging that achievement by
now appearing to reach too far.

Sir, Mackie International is located on the Belfast peace line.
All sections of the community enjoy employment in this company, a world

Peace on Belfast's peace line does exist; it has been established within the
Mackie company community. All that is required is the extension of the peace
process beyond the company boundaries to the entire community. We have
proved it is possible.
Our hope for 1994 is that all our citizens will strive vigorously to achieve

Sir, Unlike R L Webb (Letters, January 1), we do not think the introduction
of a Pounds 1m monthly jackpot prize will be counter-productive. We know
from our post bag that a lot of people will be delighted at the chance of
becoming an overnight millionaire.
The overall size of the prize fund has been increased, in order to
accommodate the new prize structure. And we will continue to pay out more
than 185,000 prizes each month in the range of Pounds 50 to Pounds 100,000,
as the odds against winning a prize in any monthly draw remain unchanged at

We cannot please everyone. However, we think that we have the spread of

FT  06 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: 'Good year' for pension funds may
have been relatively poor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GORDON CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I find your article, 'Good year for occupational pension funds'
(January 4) - regarding the 'impressive' performance of UK pension funds in
1993 - somewhat misleading.
On the basis used by many actuaries to value the assets of an ongoing
pension fund, pension scheme assets actually fell by about 1 per cent in
1993. The reasons: the changes in ACT in the April Budget effectively acted
as a tax on schemes' future income, and corporate dividend growth was
sluggish to say the least.
Those who would seek to accuse the actuaries of living in an ivory tower
would do well to consider the number of articles appearing in your paper
which attempt to rationalise the current levels of equity markets - shades
of 1987 perhaps? Those who would dismiss the actuaries' views out of hand
can always fall back on market values. On this basis the investment return
was indeed 27.8 per cent. However, the market value of the liabilities of
the typical scheme will have increased during 1993 by some 25 per cent due
to the fall in long-term interest rates. Both figures need to be considered
together.
There is a serious point to be made here. Namely the widespread
misconception that short-term market movements have an immediate impact on
the long-term finances of pension funds.
It is important that the long-term nature of corporate pension provision is
more widely understood. Rather than a good year for occupational funds, 1993
may prove to have been a relatively poor one, with the result that more
companies will have to end their contribution holidays or increase their
level of contributions, thus continuing a process widely publicised in your
paper in 1993.

FAREWELL MY CONCUBINE (15) Chen Kaige
CARLITO'S WAY (18) Brian De Palma
MAC (18) John Turturro
MALICE (15) Harold Becker
Chen Kaige's Farewell My Concubine has been compared - by foes as well as
fans - with Gone With The Wind. A sumptuous, switchbacking ride through
Chinese history from 1925 to 1977, the film lasts three hours, boasts a
giddily flamboyant cast of characters and stops off for showdowns at almost
every main station in China's 20th century story.
Japanese invasion (1937); Japanese surrender (1945); Communist takeover of
Beijing (1949); Cultural Revolution (1966); and finally the false dawn of
post-Mao 'liberalisation' (1977). No wonder both audience and characters
look travel-exhausted by the close. Chen's previous work, which included
Yellow Earth, King Of The Children and the majestically gnomic Life On A
String, was in a contrasting Oriental-inscrutable mode. You had to scratch
the austere parchment to find the feelings underneath.
Here emotions are worn on sleeves and sleeves are of dazzling-coloured silk.
Dieyi (Leslie Cheung) and Xiaolou (Zhang Fengyi) are the two Peking Opera
actors whose lives, loves and hates we follow through 50 turbulent years. On
stage Dieyi's feminine beauty has condemned him, in an all-male theatre
tradition, to play Queen to Xialou's King. Off-stage he plays queen with
equal expertise. His unrequited passion for Xialou modulates between lofty
stoicism and envenomed jealousy and finally leads - we have reached the
moral horrors of the Cultural Revolution - to his denouncing of his
beloved's ex-concubine wife Juxian, played with flashing cheekbones by
Chinese superstar Gong Li (Raise The Red Lantern).
The curtain falls on two suicides, a nation in ferment, and clouds of opium
smoke swilling about the stage from the drug-addicted last act. Some have
cried 'melodrama'. But the movie's large-breathed hyperboles create their
own oddly compelling rhythm and vision: compelling enough to have gained
last years Cannes Golden Palm ex aequo with The Piano. And the interplay
between historical backdrop and human foreground is persuasive even when
Chen takes liberties to set up frequency vibrations between the two.
The film shows its surest touch in the first scenes: Dieyi and Xialou as
children at a Peking Opera school. Chen makes the cruelties and disciplines
at this artistic forcing-house seem at once monstrous and matter-of-fact.
Boys chosen to play females are forced to repeat over and over 'I am by
nature a girl'. Bodies are rendered elastic by ruthless Procrustean
exercises. And when one boy hangs himself, Life Just Goes On. (Chen
punctuates this death with a perfect surreal detail: a dusty fold-up wooden
stage crashes down in the background, inexplicably, like a fist from God.)
The power of this first sequence energises and legitimises the scenes to
come. It shows us the appalling and readies us for the worse: the streets
thundered through by Japanese troops, the light-raked show trials, Dieyi's
lonely drift into drugs or opportunist sexual servitude. (The film shows how
political fear can make mind and heart and body bow to what is expedient
from regime to regime).
But the childhood scenes also introduce us to the miraculous - a cloud of
butterfly kites dancing outside the school gates when two boys open them to
play truant - in preparation for the marvels of defiant grace wrought by Art
out of Life. Farewell My Concubine, which takes its own title from that of
the Peking opera Dieyi and Xialou most often perform together, is itself a
hybrid of the real and visionary. Its flourishes and extravagances are as
integral to its stratagem as its grim counting off of historical milestones.
Life, Chen tells us, does not 'imitate' art, nor art life. In the mind of a
nation dazed by history, life and art are inextricably intertwined as part
of the common dream.
Life and art are both out to lunch in Brian De Palma's Carlito's Way. This
is the film of a director still seeking career re-entry after the mishap of
The Bonfire Of The Vanities. His last film Raising Cain was a brain-teasing
thriller that met no response at the box-office. So Mr De Palma has decided
to run for cover and remake, in all but name, his 1983 remake of Scarface.
Al Pacino, drugs, gangsters, murder feuds and a we-mean-business running
time (2 1/2 hours) ensue. Mr P plays Carlito Brigante: black-bearded,
snappily dressed and trying to 'go straight' in 1970s East Harlem after five
years in prison, except that as he tells his improbably longsuffering
girlfriend Penelope Ann Miller, 'I gotta do just this one thing to get out'.
(Help a friend with a prison rescue.)
'Get out,' he means, of the criminal milieu. Which makes it odd that the
first thing our new crime-resistant Mr Pacino does is to buy into a
gangster-infested nightclub with his crooked lawyer friend Sean Penn
(scarce-recognisable in curly red wig and gold-rim specs). Soon - to
Carlito's surprise if not to ours - there is blood in the Martinis and
bullet-holes in the chrome-and-cream decor (designer, Richard 'Cotton Club'
Sylbert). And the prison rescue bid looks horribly as if it might go wrong .
. .
David Koepp's script is based on two novels by Justice Edwin Torres. If he
had made it three novels, we might have had some real crazy-quilted
incoherence. Instead we have the sense that pages are being turned and books
swapped as turgid dialogue (Pacino and Miller) alternates in random rubato
with sudden fizzes of violence or Method acting (Pacino and Penn). As for
the climax, another De Palma suspense-and-action special set in Grand
Central Station (see The Untouchables), it seems like a director's
despairing attempt to use old glories to add lustre to a stubbornly dingy
project.
Mac comes to us from another Italian-American playing delicate career moves:
actor turned first-time film-maker John Turturro. Mr T, he of the black
wire-wool hair and frightened rabbit eyes, was the title hero of Barton Fink
and the gibbering execution victim in Miller's Crossing. Now he stars as a
self-made builder in 1950s Queens, New York: one of three career-sharing
Italian brothers who rage, joke, love, squabble and occasionally apply
mortar to brickwork.
Turturro's Mac is based on his own father and is wonderfully fullblooded.
Building, for this man, is not a job but a mythology. He lectures his
siblings on Romulus and Remus. And as mishaps accumulate - Mac
near-bankrupted in a bidding war for land, a worker tumbling from a roof,
the brothers splitting up after a quarrel - he is right out there in the
street raving and orating about the sanctity of Work.
The film could have been written by Arthur Miller and directed by Federico
Fellini. Fellini would have loved the touch of the dead father turning to
his pallbearing sons to deliver his last work-proud message: 'I built this
coffin]' And Miller - whose Eddie Carbone in A View From The Bridge would
happily break grissini with these New York Italian brothers-in-sweat - would
enjoy the heady mixture of dynastic tragi-comedy with work-ethic moralism.
Who is expected to enjoy Malice only Hollywood's arcaner market-research
departments could tell us. Category: thriller. Sub-category: 'lodger from
Hell'. When Dr Alec Baldwin, a gifted sawbones with a tendency to float from
town to town, moves in with married couple Bill Pullman and Nicole Kidman,
who could anticipate that suspense, terror, insurance fraud, marital
breakdown and a near-fatal hospital operation will ensue?
Almost anyone could anticipate most of these. Not just from Jerry
Goldsmith's eerie, mocking music but from Harold (Sea Of Love) Becker's
eerie, mocking direction and from Alec Baldwin's ditto, ditto performance.
George C Scott and Anne Bancroft appear, looking mildly shellshocked in
guest roles. The script by Aaron Sorkin (A Few Good Men) stumbles about
between coincidence and contrivance. And after several reels set in modest
suburbia, the finale takes place in a storm-besieged cliff-edge mansion
which would seem over the top in an Edgar Allan Poe film.

BBC2 continues its week of Dance For The Camera in which short ballets are
created expressly for television, with 'Beethoven In Love' by choreographer
and dancer Liz Aggiss (7.15). The first episode of BBC1's hospital comedy
Health And Efficiency (which, for the information of those who were
schoolboys in the 1950s, contains not a single naked lady toying with a
beach ball) looked pretty promising, mainly because it exploits all the
lunacies of today's market-driven healthcare schemes (8.00).
Perhaps George Cole's 'last' series of Minder will prove no more final than
Dame Nellie Melba's farewell concerts, but no doubt we shall watch just in
case. There are 10 episodes, starting tonight with a yarn in which Arthur is
looking for capital to finance a nice little earner involving freezers,
mopeds, and a Sicilian called The Pizza Man (8.30 ITV).
VCRs will be needed at 9.00 when a new series of David Jessel's Trial And
Error series (C4) on miscarriages of justice clashes with the first in The
All New Alexei Sayle Show (BBC2). Sayle may one day be seen as the most
inspired comedian of his generation.

FT  06 JAN 94 / Arts: 'Sunset Boulevard' in Los Angeles / Review of the US
premiere of Lloyd Webber's musical
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FRICKER

<TEXT>
If you come to Los Angeles looking for the mansion at 10086 Sunset
Boulevard, you will be disappointed. That house, the setting of Billy
Wilder's classic 1950 film satire of Hollywood, never existed at that
location. It was a made-up address on a real street, just as Wilder's Sunset
Boulevard was an excoriating flight of fancy on a topic that is true-to-life
indeed - Hollywood's capacity to create images and destroy lives.
If you come to Los Angeles looking for satisfaction from Andrew Lloyd
Webber's new musicalisation of Wilder's film, you will be disappointed
again. Lloyd Webber's Sunset Boulevard, which had its American premiere at
the Shubert Theatre here last month, is to Wilder's original what a dirt
road is to a motorway. Its display of heartless spectacle degrades everyone
involved, most of all Glenn Close, who plays the faded silent movie star
Norma Desmond, the role Gloria Swanson played in the film.
The musical Sunset, which is also playing at the Adelphi Theatre in London,
features everything we have come to expect from Lloyd Webber and Co. -
lavish sets and costumes, a large cast, a bloated pseudo-operatic score -
but wholly lacks a consistent tone.
While Wilder's Sunset was an elegant fusing of sendup and homage, Lloyd
Webber's wavers between the celebratory impulses of musical theatre and the
ironic distance of satire, and Trevor Nunn's unassertive direction evens
nothing out.
The dialogue jolts between spoken lines, most taken from the film (all the
favourites are retained: 'I am big; it's the pictures that got small'; 'I'm
ready for my close-up, Mr. De Mille') - and recitative, sung by Joe Gillis
(Alan Campbell), the down-on-his-luck screenwriter whom Norma entraps to
stage her 'return'. For the music, Lloyd Webber largely recycles tunes from
his past work into a grab-bag of blowsy ballads and Big Group Numbers. It is
in the latter that librettist/lyricists Don Black and Christopher Hampton
make their most concerted stab at irony (studio wannabes singing 'Let's Have
Lunch', a gaggle of fey dressers exhorting Joe to buy more clothes because
'The Lady's Paying'), but their attempts at acidity clash with Lloyd
Webber's peppy tunes and Bob Avian's high-energy stagings.
Amidst it all stalks Close, a marvel of ill-employed concentration. Holding
her taloned hands like a surgeon leaving a scrub room, bedecked in Anthony
Powell's de luxe costumes - jungle-printed pyjamas, lame dusters and jeweled
turbans - she looks and behaves every inch a Norma Desmond, but she is an
island of high camp in a sea of humourless ineptitude, and ends up looking
foolish. An additional problem is her singing voice, which is thin and
over-amplified, and her songs fail to compel. There is no reason for Norma's
simple and ever-strengthening convictions to be driven home through four
solo and two shared numbers, except to show off a star's voice - a rationale
which made more sense in the London production, with belter Patti LuPone in
the role, than it does here.
It is Joe Gillis whose inner life needs revealing, for Sunset Boulevard is
the story of his journey from professional to personal desperation and
eventual destruction. Though the evolution of Joe's relationship with Norma
indicates a broad range of emotions towards her - pity, curiosity, awe,
disgust, admiration, greed, attraction - there is little in the dialogue or
lyrics to indicate his changes in attitude. It is left to the actor playing
Joe to communicate these transitions through his expressions and actions,
but Campbell's barking, abrasive demeanour remains the same throughout, and
he and Close do not develop any relationship on stage. Campbell's golden-boy
good looks do not fit the role, and he is only given one song with which to
show off his excellent singing voice - the bombastic title tune.
Another character marred by the show's inept musicalisation is Max von
Mayerling (George Hearn), Norma' ex-husband and former
director-turned-butler, who must step outside his taciturn demeanor to
inform Joe that Norma was 'The Greatest Star of All.' Standing stiffly and
orating overblown lyrics ('there was/a majaraha/who hanged himself with one
of her/discarded stockings/she's immortal'), Hearn, like Close, ends up with
Lloyd Webber's egg on his face.
Only Judy Kuhn as Betty Schaefer, the young writer who becomes Norma's rival
for Joe's affections, comes out with her reputation intact. Her songs and
dialogue plausible, and her singing clear and strong, she is a lovely
presence, and Campbell is at his best when he's playing opposite her.
As with all of Lloyd Webber's efforts, there is always a massive set to
marvel at. John Napier's rendering of Norma's rococo palace is indeed an
eerie wonder of dark wood and brass, but it has the distracting habit of
levitating at the least opportune moments. Lifting up Norma's house during a
New Year's Eve scene and slipping another set in underneath serves no
purpose other than to prove that it can be done. Worse still are the
hydraulic high jinks that accompany Joe's death scene. As the musical makes
its last attempt to draw the audience in, the set and the characters on it
move away from the audience for the sake of a sight gag - Joe taking a
header into Norma's pool, which has implausibly manifested itself in the
centre of her living room floor.
Lloyd Webber's musicals always fare well in spectacle-loving Los Angeles,
and the added frisson of a show about itself has set the city Sunset-crazy;
despite mixed local reviews, Sunset set a Shubert Theatre box-office record
(Dollars 512,130) the day after opening.
Meanwhile, the gossip about whether it will be LuPone or Close who plays
Norma when Sunset opens on Broadway this autumn rages on, but what does it
matter? Both are big stars, and this musical is too small for either of
them.

FT  06 JAN 94 / Arts: An Absolute Turkey - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Peter Hall's production of a new English version of Georges Feydeau's Le
Dindon has a wonderful cast and some fine performances. It is always
interesting, partly because it entices you to believe that the best lines
and situations must be just around the corner. That illusion is maintained
to the end. By then you realise what you may have suspected at the start: An
Absolute Turkey is more a sentimental comedy than a French farce.
Here is a rather gentle tale of French life where really serious
misdemeanours never quite take place, there is no cruelty, hardly anyone
loses their trousers and all ends happily. In short, Le Dindon has become
very English, more PG Wodehouse than Feydeau.
Once you have accepted the change of genre, the piece flows along very
nicely. Felicity Kendal plays Lucienne, the faithful wife who will betray
her husband only if she has evidence of his own infidelity, and then for
revenge - not desire. No production graced by Ms Kendal's presence can be
without pleasure.
The same can be said of Griff Rhys Jones who plays Redillon, the promiscuous
lover with a score card of one in three out of the women he approaches. When
Lucienne becomes available, he is too tired to take advantage. Rhys Jones,
too, is a joy to watch: for all his philandering he seems a nice man at
heart.
The nicest man of the lot - and this may have taken the sting out of the
play - is Geoffrey Hutchings as Vatelin, husband of Lucienne. A charming
Paris lawyer who collects paintings by the relatives of the French
Impressionists on the grounds that they are so cheap they must be a good
investment, he has been unfaithful only once - with a woman called Mitzi
when he had to spend to spend a month working in Zurich. There is never much
chance that he will be seriously embarrassed even when Mitzi (Rosie Timpson)
turns up in Paris. Vatelin nearly always does the decent thing, which is why
Lucienne sticks to him.
There are also some splendid minor performances, notably by Richard Henders
as a hotel page boy suffering from puberty, which is taken as some kind of
disease. Linda Spurrier is an outstanding Madame Pinchard, the near totally
deaf wife of a French general. She has that irritating habit of near deaf
people of being sharp of hearing just when you least expect it. Lip-readers
will appreciate her line: 'Why do you always talk with your back to me? I
can't see a word you're saying.'
There are far too many characters in the play: 22 altogether, played by a
cast of 18. Some of the best are never allowed to develop - like Mitzi's
husband who looks about as provincially Swiss as you are likely to get, but
turns out to have been born in Marseilles. The multiplicity of characters
slows down the pace. This is a criticism of Feydeau not of Hall: in a good
farce you do not want new faces constantly bursting through doors - they
distract from the framework.
It is also a mistake, despite the need to change the sets, to have two
intervals. That again slows down the action. Still, the designs by Gerald
Scarfe are very pretty: quite in line with the comedy that the play has
become.

The company took the opportunity to congratulate Denison on his role in
pursuing a successful claim in the US courts for damages of Dollars 8.5m,
which was announced last week, against KPMG Peat Marwick regarding the
acquisition of a 50 per cent stake in Rangaire Corporation in 1988.
Dealing in the shares of SHT, which has borrowings of around Pounds 24m, has

FT  06 JAN 94 / Technology: How to get fit in your front room - From
microprocessors to polyurethane / A look at trends in home exercise
equipment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES ARTHUR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As the festive season fades, do you fancy skiing in your front room? Or
would you prefer rowing, cycling, skating, or some straightforward sit-ups?
If you have just bought some home exercise equipment as a seasonal present -
perhaps for yourself - you have joined the growing army of the
health-conscious. A new report from Mintel, the market research company,
says that between 4m and 5m people in the UK do some sort of exercise at
home, and last year spent Pounds 112m on health and fitness equipment for
their own use.
The most popular items of exercise equipment, with a third of the market by
value, are exercise bicycles. Next, with 25 per cent of sales, is
weight-training equipment, followed by rowing machines and 'multigyms' -
single pieces of equipment which the user can manipulate to exercise
different sets of muscles independently - each with 14 per cent.
Languishing well behind are step items; these cover both the
'stair-climbing' products, heavily advertised on television, that reproduce
the movement of climbing stairs, and the aerobic exerciser consisting of a
simple polyurethane step about a metre wide and 25cm high. 'Treadmills' (for
indoor jogging) bring up the rear with 5 per cent.
Most of these items have been around in some form for years. At present, the
overall market is static - a fact that Mintel puts down to consumers' slow
emergence from recession. But within it, there are some interesting
developments. Exercise bicycles, weight-training and rowing machines have
all declined in terms of market share. Instead, 'step' items and multigyms
have taken their place.
The link is almost certainly technology, mixed to some extent with the
glamour of the new. Most noticeable is the advent of computers. As the cost
of microprocessors has fallen rapidly, it has become cheap to add them to
any sort of fitness machine to provide an eye-catching promise of more
information about how much gain the user is receiving for all that pain.
Nowadays, any machine without a light winking at and chiding the prospective
user tends to be passed over. Fahim Baree, manager of the gym equipment
department at Lillywhites, the big London sports store, observes that 'the
computers can time you, tell you your strokes or strides per minute, how
many calories you've burnt off so far, how 'far' you've gone, your average
speed'.
There are also systems which can be programmed so the machine offers
different amounts of resistance at different parts of the exercise,
mimicking a real route. Indeed, some people seek add-ons, to catalogue their
effort in greater detail. 'People are becoming more sophisticated. When I
started here three years ago, we didn't have heart rate monitors for sale,'
says Baree. 'Now people ask for them, to watch that they're exercising at
the right intensity to improve their fitness.'
Even so, such measures can only be an average at best; no one burns calories
at exactly the same rate. And the 'distance gone' - a measure which allows
people to row single-handed across the Atlantic, complete the Tour de France
or walk up the Empire State Building, while staying in comfortable reach of
bed, bathroom and beverages - can only be approximate. Such machines never
take into account the variable difficulty, for example, of pulling one
machine's 'oar' rather than another's, so that one machine's 'Olympic' class
may be another's run-of-the-treadmill.
Yet the greatest boon to the personal fitness industry in recent years is
probably not microprocessors but polyurethane - the tough plastic that has
become a staple of so many items, from the seats of exercise machines to the
simple 'step' currently so popular with the aerobic classes and multigyms
advertised on television.
The plastic is strong enough to bear the six months' or so use that is
common before the item is consigned, as the majority are, to live the rest
of its life beneath the stairs. But it also makes it affordable. For
example, mini-multigyms often use plastic loops which have to be stretched
to exercise the muscles. Where rubber might give way, plastic can stand up
to the strain.
Improvements in plastics technology have produced a couple of intriguing
items in the past couple of years. Newly popular at Lillywhites is the
'Bodyslide', which consists of a thick, smooth plastic mat about 2.5m long
and 1m wide. The user slips on a pair of slick plastic overshoes like
galoshes, and then exercises on the mat using a skating action. 'Very good
for the legs,' says Baree. 'They tend to sell once people see them being
demonstrated.' Otherwise, it just looks like an unwelcoming mat.
Similar in motion, if not exactly in use, are 'in-line skates', the modern
version of the roller skate. But rather than their predecessor's thick
wheels on either side of the shoe, in-line skates (one version being the
Rollerblade) have thin polypropylene wheels mounted along the centre of the
shoe, which itself covers the foot and ankle in a rigid casing like a
comfortable ski boot. Once strapped in, you move just like a skater.
Most people soon learn how to reach a comfortable speed, getting useful
exercise. (The problem then becomes how to stop; David Wheaton, the American
tennis player, once spent an enforced rest after putting his hand through a
plate-glass window in trying to halt his progress.)
The skates are already enormously popular in the US, where some people use
them to commute, and they have begun filtering into Britain in increasing
numbers, where they are being touted as an excellent training for skiing.
For the future, industry observers expect skiing machines, such as those
made by US companies Precor and NordicTrack, to become increasingly popular.
Like in-line skates, these have also been big sellers in the American market
for some years, but are now filtering across the Atlantic (and also from
Scandinavia) as the message has spread about the benefits of cross-country
skiing, hailed as possibly the best exercise for the whole body.
The popular forms consist of two shoes mounted on separate, sliding tracks,
with rods or cables to be held in the hands. As one hand goes forward, so
does the opposite foot. It sounds simple, and is, but it is expected to be
one of this year's biggest sellers. It works on roughly the same principle
as last year's big hit, the stair-climbing system, which uses hydraulic
pistons to provide resistance to the pressure of the foot; as one foot goes
down it has to push the other up.
But as with all home exercise machines, the big problem is getting a good
return on your investment. 'You have to be very disciplined,' comments Jenny
Tarsnane, development officer at the National Association of Health and
Exercise Teachers. 'If I didn't teach in a gym, I still wouldn't exercise at
home. I like going with someone to a class or gym.' Indeed, Mintel's survey
also shows that people spent Pounds 465m solely on membership and entrance
fees at private clubs in Britain in 1992 - nearly four times as much as on
home equipment.
Tarsnane's advice for the prospective buyer? 'Don't be seduced by the hype.
Evaluate the amount you're about to spend and if it would be better spent
going to a gym. It worries me how people buy equipment and go bananas with
it for a while, then hurt themselves and stop, or are left with aches and
pains; or feel it's having no effect and give up.'
In fact, she says, 'If you just want to lose some fat, it might be better
just to go for half-hour walks.' Then, you can always buy a pedometer to
time yourself, measure how far you have walked, estimate the number of
calories burnt, and your pace per minute.

FT  06 JAN 94 / People: Tate moves to Sorbus Europe
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lee Tate, who was responsible for the launch and development of
International Network Services, the UK-based electronic trading pioneer, has
been appointed managing director of Sorbus Europe - another of ICL's
multinational joint ventures.
Sorbus Europe is a joint venture operation between ICL, the UK-based
computer group, and Bell Atlantic Business Systems International of the US
and is one of Europe's leading independent computer maintenance and support
groups.
Tate, 54, has a high reputation in the IT industry having been managing
director of INS since its launch seven years ago. During that time INS
increased both its revenues and profits each year operating in the fast
expanding field of electronic data interchange which companies use to
replace traditional paper-based forms such as orders, invoices and other
business-to-business communications.
Tate's move to Sorbus coincides with a reorganisation at INS under which GE
Information Services of the US has purchased ICL's 50 per cent shareholding
in INS to make it a wholly-owned GEIS subsidiary. The sale of ICL's stake
reflects the group's strategy of developing its core businesses.
Tate has been succeeded as managing director of INS by John Thorpe, 44, who
was previously director of software at INS and has been a director with the
company since it was launched in February 1987.
Under Tate INS is expected to concentrate on developing software for
worldwide sales and developing more value-added applications which will
enable customers to benefit from GEIS' portfolio of electronic commercial
services.

Jim Payne, one of the most prominent figures in the London reinsurance
market, is to retire from the Sedgwick Group later this year. Payne, now 56,
retired as chairman of Sedgwick Payne (the Sedgwick Group's reinsurance
subsidiary) at the end of last year, and will leave his position as
vice-chairman of Sedgwick Group itself in March. Payne joined EW Payne in
1954 and did much to build up its reinsurance business in the 1970s and
1980s, both before and after its acquisition by Sedgwick in 1978.
More recently Payne has played a role in attracting corporate capital to the
Lloyd's of London market. He will continue as a board member of CLM
Insurance Fund, one of the new Lloyd's investment trusts. He is succeeded at
Sedgwick Payne by Jonathan Gilbert, deputy chairman and managing director of
Sedgwick Payne and a board director of the group. Gilbert, who is also 56,
has specialised in energy insurance broking. He joined Sedgwick in 1957 and
was appointed to the board in 1981.

FT  06 JAN 94 / Technology: The appliance of ski science - Andrew Fisher
considers the latest developments in Alpine technology
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To those who lurch clumsily down Alpine slopes while others glide along with
grace and speed, technology might not seem to have much of a role in skiing.
Some people simply ski better than others.
But skis, boots, bindings and even ski poles have developed considerably in
the past few years. They do not just look better than their predecessors,
they perform more effectively and durably for skiers of all skill levels.
Skis are designed to absorb more shock impact, boots to provide comfort as
well as support, and bindings to be adjustable for soft, hard or icy
surfaces.
These days, says Robbie Young, a UK sales representative with Salomon, the
French ski equipment company, people tend to ski longer during the day and
on harder surfaces. 'Skiing has changed dramatically as a result of
artificial snow,' he says. Many European resorts have snow machines and
those in North America use them early in the season to lay down a deep snow
base.
With the range of ski equipment on offer, however, it is easy to become
confused. Advanced materials, new methods of manufacturing skis, and the
variety of skis and boots - stronger, lighter, and more efficient at
transmitting energy from the body to the ski edge - have added the
complexities of high technology to Alpine sports.
'Gone are the days of flexing skis from the rack in a shop to discern their
finer qualities,' writes John Vaitkus, head of the test team of Ellis
Brigham, the UK winter sports retailers, in its latest brochure. 'I'm afraid
most manufacturers' blurb is best described as bull]'
Ellis Brigham tests out the newest equipment every year at Chamonix in
France. Most buyers will not be aware of, or care too much about, the latest
techniques used by ski makers such as Salomon, Rossignol, Kastle, Fischer or
K2. They will pick what suits their pocket and ability, bearing in mind that
much equipment will be used only for a week or two each year.
David Whitlow, Ellis Brigham's marketing director, says the company ignores
what manufacturers say about their products when it tests them. 'We only
really buy skis which make skiers smile.' Among its recommendations (and
those of Snow + Rock, its UK rival), is the monocoque range developed by
Salomon.
The monocoque is built as a one-piece shell, the aim being to transmit more
energy to the edges, on which most skiing is done. The load-bearing shell is
made from epoxy glass or composite material and filled with wood or
high-density foam. The part of the ski (the platform) under the boot is
designed to absorb shock and give skiers an accurate feel of the snow.
Salomon claims its skis are at least 20 per cent more efficient at
transmitting energy to the edges than most other makes. But rivals have also
come up with high-tech products.
The 4SV ski made by Rossignol, also French, for expert skiers uses a 'double
torsion box' structure with an inner layer of kevlar and carbon and an outer
casing of reinforced metal fibre strengthened at the sides with Quarztel, a
new quartz fibre.
Kastle, an Austrian company, developed its Syncap system with the Formula
One motor racing team run by its owner, Italy's Benetton family. The system
comprises a hard body shell of fibre - glass and epoxy for strength and
control and an inner layer of softer visco-elastic material to dampen
vibrations. For real speedsters, it mounts a carbon-kevlar reinforced
acceleration plate on the back of its top skis to stiffen them and give a
'catapult effect' out of the curves.
To reduce weight, Kastle uses a light wood core, fine air channels and
synthetic fibres on its lightweight Air Technology skis which it says are
some 25 per cent lighter than earlier models. These are for skiers who put
elegance and comfort above speed.

FT  06 JAN 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): The personnel touch
 -How Kenwood staff became image ambassadors in an advertising campaign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The picture shows a pretty female athlete sitting on the ground looking
sweaty and disappointed. Another shows a middle-aged Japanese man perched on
a bar stool playing flamenco guitar. A third is of a young Spaniard
scrambling up a rock face.
These images are not designed to sell running shoes, music lessons, or
stamina-building breakfast cereals. Instead they are advertisements for
Kenwood, the Japanese manufacturer of hi-fi, car radio and communications
equipment.
Kenwood is not the first company to attempt to build its brand through
advertisements that have nothing to do with the product it is trying to
sell. Indeed, since Benetton started selling sweaters using pictures of
newborn babies and men dying of Aids, there have been no limits on possible
subject matters for copywriters.
However, the Kenwood campaign presents a departure from the norm: it is
among the first to try to create a brand image based on its staff. And
stranger still, the images do not concern what its staff do when they are at
work, but what they do in their spare time.
The picture of the runner bears the caption: 'Tina Shanur. Order clerk,
parts department, Kenwood USA. 10km runner. Personal best, 57 minutes 26
seconds. Today, 59.15. Damn, damn, damn.'
The message is that these people are committed to whatever they do, they are
individuals in their own right, they are strivers and they work for a
company that encourages them.
Most companies will trot out the cliche about their people being their most
valuable asset. But until now this idea has been used mainly for talking to
employees or to shareholders. Kenwood is taking it one step further by
putting its people at the heart of its sales thrust to the
consumer.
Kenwood recognised that building a brand for electronic products is not
easy. Shared technology means there is little difference between the
products. Successful advertising must convince people that the brand is
suited to their personality. It must create some kind of an emotional link
between the brand and the way people feel.
Kenwood gave the agency, Oxfordshire-based Watts Lord, the task of
developing a character for the brand that would achieve this. 'We did not
want something heavy, or something that would say 'we are wonderful',' says
Bob Griffiths, Kenwood UK's sales and marketing director.
The agency hit upon the idea of finding employees at all levels who could
become 'ambassadors for the brand'.
In order to find these ambassadors the company wrote to its branches all
round the world for suitable candidates. 'These people are not superheroes.
But they all show personal commitment in fields outside the company,' says
Ken Buckfield, managing director of Watts
Lord.
The agency now has a fat file of employees who deliver meals on wheels, ride
horses, restore antique cars, or sail yachts - any of whom could feature in
future advertisements.
'We are trying to develop a personality for our products. We are not just a
consumer electronics company, we are more like a family,' says Griffiths.
This is brand advertising of a pretty risky kind. After all, most people
have hobbies, and in any organisation it should be possible to find
employees who pursue them seriously: indeed, cynics might argue that the
more boring the job and badly treated the employee, the more employees will
throw themselves into their outside interests.
'You get the message these advertisements are about people, but they are too
intangible. I don't really get the connection,'
says Mac Cato, of Desgrippes
Cato Gobe, the image
consultancy.
But even if people get the message that Kenwood employees are a family of
special individuals, will that really make them more likely to buy the
product? 'If people can relate to the brand, then they'll put it on the
shopping list,' says Griffiths.
So far, says the company, the advertisements have gone down well. Consumers
apparently like the look of the pictures so much that they have written in
asking for copies to hang on their walls.
Rio Takegawa, the guitar player, has had invitations to perform a recital.
Tina Shanur has been offered modelling work. And Jordi Puyal, the handsome
rock climber, has received approaches from several European women.
Maybe this proves the advertisements have made their mark. Or maybe it shows
that people are so literal-minded that when they look at the pictures they
think it is the services of the people themselves that are for sale.

FT  06 JAN 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Branded bargains -
Plans for factory outlet centres throughout the UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As the fuss dies down over the arrival in the UK of warehouse clubs, the US
bulk-selling discount format, retailers are waking up to a new threat from
the US: factory outlet centres.
After warehouse clubs, these discount centres or malls have been the
fastest-growing form of selling in the US over the last decade, with sales
reaching Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.7bn) last year.
Now, both UK and US developers are planning to build on the success of the
first two factory outlet centres in Britain - Hornsea Freeport and Clarks
Village. Hornsea Freeport, which opened three years ago in Humberside,
attracted 1.4m visitors last year and Clarks Village at Street in Somerset
had 1m visitors between opening in August 1993 and the end of the year.
Developers have at least 15 further projects in the pipeline for the UK and
then plan to move into continental Europe. These projects will put pressure
on traditional retailers, particularly on small independent stores, and
expose the clothing sector to the kind of price competition that has
developed in the UK grocery industry in the last three years.
Discount factory shops, often situated on factory premises, where
manufacturers sell off overmakes, slight seconds, or retailers' returns, are
already well-established in the UK. Corporate Intelligence, the retail
consultancy, estimates there are at least 1,400.
What developers started doing in the US in the early 1980s, and now want to
do throughout the UK, is to group such outlets together in purpose-built
malls. Shoppers can then choose from a wide range of branded goods from
manufacturers such as Calvin Klein, Nike, Aquascutum or Laura Ashley, at
prices up to 50 per cent below conventional retail outlets.
There are almost 300 factory outlet malls in the US, with about another 150
planned. Average size is around 150,000 sq ft, but some are more than 1.5m
sq ft - as big as the largest UK out-of-town shopping centres. Forecasters
expect total turnover to double to Dollars 20bn by the end of the decade.
The centres offer advantages to both manufacturers and consumers. Shoppers
have the chance to buy branded goods they otherwise might not be able to
afford. They can also turn a shopping trip into a day out, as factory outlet
centres are designed as 'destination' shopping venues, offering facilities
such as playgrounds and restaurants.
Manufacturers enjoy the ability to sell surplus stock at a profit, and in a
controlled way that does not damage the brand. Traditionally, surplus stock
has been sold into the discount wholesale and retail trade, which can
include market stalls, where manufacturers do not control their brand image.
'Initially, profit was not the driving factor, it was turning distressed
stock into cash,' says Paul Knight, retail and factory outlet development
manager at shoe manufacturer C &amp; J Clark, which operates Clarks Village.
'But in the US people have realised these malls are not just means of
disposing of stock, they are successful profit centres in their own right,'
says Knight.
US manufacturers have turned factory shops into a powerful marketing tool.
Some companies use them to test-market products before launching them in
high street stores.
The outlets can also be used to sell current lines - for example,
avant-garde designs that have not caught on in the mainstream retail market.
But opinions are divided on how successful the format is likely to be in the
UK. Robert Clark, director of Corporate Intelligence, says there could be
scope for up to 50 outlet centres, with annual sales of Pounds 1bn.
'We reckon they will prove very popular indeed. There is a thirst for that
kind of retailing, and a realisation that these places not only offer good
value but a good day out.'
Others are more cautious. Richard Ashworth, partner specialising in
out-of-town retailing at Hillier Parker, the commercial property agents,
says there may be scope for fewer than 30. 'The UK is not big enough for
them to proliferate,' he says.
US operators have built most factory outlet malls an hour or more's drive
from the nearest large city. In the smaller, more densely-populated
countries of Europe, few such sites exist.
Another potential problem is opposition from retailers unhappy at seeing
their prices undercut by manufacturers selling directly to the public. So
far, there has been little opposition from US retailers to the centres,
partly because they have been sited well away from cities. McArthur/Glen,
one of the biggest US factory outlet operators, says it is sensitive to high
street retailers, and does not, for example, use specific brand names in
advertisements for its centres.
But European retailers may defend their markets more aggressively. Costco,
the US warehouse club operator, had to go to the High Court last year to
fend off a joint legal challenge from the UK's three biggest supermarket
chains Sainsbury, Safeway and Tesco, aimed at overturning planning
permission for its first warehouse club in Britain.
Both the size of the market, and opposition from retailers, may depend on
who factory outlet centres appeal to. In the US, where brand-buying is well
established and designer labels sought after, factory centres have a broad
appeal. In the UK, where retailers such as Marks and Spencer offer quality
own-label alternatives more cheaply, it is less clear who the centres'
target audience will be.
Knight says research at the Clarks Village suggested it appealed to
'brand-conscious, aspirational people. Those who didn't aspire to brands
were the ones who went away disappointed,' he says. 'They were looking for
'cheap', but we are not 'cheap'.'
But while factory outlet centres do not sell 'cheap' goods, and their share
of the UK market could be limited, they are still expected to have a
significant impact on UK retailing. Only 10 per cent of clothing in the UK
is sold through discount outlets, compared with almost 50 per cent in the
US, and factory centres are likely to narrow the gap.
By establishing new lower price 'floors' for branded goods they will further
increase price competition among retailers, and help turn the 1990s into
what retailers are already calling the 'value' decade.

FT  06 JAN 94 / Accountancy Column: What Jim Butler saw in over 40 years
service - Andrew Jack talks to a veteran of the accountancy world
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jim Butler started work in what later became the Lord Mayor of London's
official residence, retired last week from what used to be a cold storage
depot, and will soon be lingering briefly in the Caribbean before returning
to a 500-acre farm near Winchester.
The venues may seem bizarre for someone who has spent his lifetime as an
accountant, but then the man in question has witnessed enormous and
sometimes unexpected change in his 41 years with the profession.
Jim Butler joined Peat Marwick Mitchell &amp; Co as an articled clerk on Pounds
150 a year in 1952, after graduating with a degree in mathematics from
Cambridge University. The firm then had 44 partners and just over 1,000
staff across 18 offices in the UK. Fee income was Pounds 1.2m.
When he retired at the end of 1993 as senior partner, KPMG Peat Marwick, of
which it is now part, had just reported fee income of Pounds 492m, and had
become part of the second largest accountancy network in the world. In the
UK, it has 594 partners and 6,300 staff in 43 offices. He describes his own
income as in the 'hundreds of thousands' a year.
'There have been some pretty dramatic changes, all very much for the good,'
says Butler, reflecting on his time in the profession as he sits in his
office overlooking the south bank of the river Thames from Puddle Dock, a
rather uninspiring concrete building that used to store frozen meat.
When he started, the firm was based in Ironmonger Lane in the City of
London, until recently the temporary home of the Lord Mayor. At the time it
was owned by the Peat family whose connections with Peat Marwick began in
1870 and remain strong.
Mr Michael Peat was until recently a partner and auditor to the privy purse,
or the Queen's private finances, a post held in the family for four
generations. Mr Gerard Peat, his father, now aged 73, was the last member to
benefit from an automatic right to become a partner. The first senior
partner who was not a Peat was appointed only in 1965.
Butler says just four 'general' partners controlled the firm when he joined:
Ronnie Leach, Gerard Peat, Freddie Proctor and John Corbett. 'We were in
fear of them. Corbett reduced me virtually to tears. I remember once quaking
at my desk waiting to see him.'
There were other 'general' partners too, who received a share of the profits
of the firm's six relatively autonomous regional partnerships. But as he
puts it: 'There were general partners and general partners.'
Some things have become more egalitarian since then. Partners' first names
appear on their doors, and the distinction of tea on a tray for partners and
not for staff has gone.
But the full partnership has still only ever voted on two issues: the merger
with Klynveld Main Goerdeler (KMG) in 1987, and the ratification of Butler's
successor, Colin Sharman, last year.
While their influence and profit share may have waned, the general partners
remain. So, too, does the regional structure, which Butler admits was
developed to evade professional rules which limited an accountancy firm to
20 partners, and which were only repealed in 1967. 'It was perfectly legal
and never challenged,' he says.
The restriction affected Butler, who was made an 'associate partner' - with
no equity stake in the firm but a place on the firm's letterhead - in London
in 1965 before a full partnership vacancy came up two years later. 'It was a
case of waiting for dead men's shoes,' he says. 'The retirement age was
fluid upwards, and for a long time till recently partnership was a job for
life.'
Back in the 1950s, he says, 'life was quite a lot easier and much more
mundane. Creative accounting was not a great feature. Things were much more
pedestrian. I audited a retail store and spent three days checking a till
roll against invoices.'
'We did everything for clients: audit, tax, advisory, investigation work for
acquisitions.' He even became a receiver during the property crash of the
early 1970s.
He says his predecessors would have been surprised by the growth in
technical departments within the larger firms, which advise clients on
compliance with the rules. 'The regulations have been tightened - rightly.
But if something is permitted, companies are going to want to do it.'
Clients have changed greatly over the years, he says. 'They have internal
ways of dealing with a lot of things now, such as very strong internal
acquisitions teams. They understand their own accounts much more than they
used to.'
He believes that in the past they treated the auditor with more respect as a
feared and independent character, invariably calling him 'Mr'.
Butler says he has been personally frustrated by the difficulty in
maintaining the traditional close relationship he has developed with his
clients - not least with Lonrho, the conglomerate. He remains a staunch
defender of the firm's position. 'Our role there never caused us any worry,'
he said. 'Anything at Lonrho we looked at extra carefully. The technical
department was involved.'
He says one of his greatest concerns was the enormous lawsuit brought in
relation to KPMG's audit of ISC, the fraudulent defence company purchased by
Ferranti, which the firm settled for Pounds 40m.
But he says the most important change within the firm for him was the 1987
merger with KMG, an international network which included Thomson McLintock
in the UK. He says merger mania began in 1984 in the US. 'Everyone said they
needed to get bigger.' He says the firm's merger was not driven by economic
need, but a 'continental strategy' reflecting the changes within Europe.
The details of the merger that was to become KPMG Peat Marwick were
developed between the senior partners of the firms in the US, Canada, UK and
Netherlands. 'I kept it secret from my own partners,' he says. 'We had a
continental strategy.'
Since then, the thrust to ever-bigger practices has waned. The firm went
from recruiting 1,000 graduates a year in the late 1980s to just 500 today.
It also introduced redundancy programmes - from which even partners did not
escape.
'Accountancy firms have become very much businesses,' he says. 'In practical
terms we run ourselves much more like a corporation now, with an executive
committee of senior partners. The top people spend much more time internally
than in the past.
'We have to be much more commercial. There is tremendous competition: in
audit tenders, the public sector, in consultancy and even in insolvency.'
He recalls that 'everyone was horrified' initially at the lifting of a ban
on marketing within the profession in the early 1980s. 'We always did
entertaining in the past: there were clubs and friendly competition.'
He denies commercialism has been at the expense of professionalism. 'We are
spending more and more time on risk management. We are open to claims if
not. We have to be commercial in order to get work, but we cannot afford not
to do our best to ensure we do first class, quality work.'

FT  06 JAN 94 / Affair that raises questions for party of family values: The
political fall-out for John Major after Tim Yeo's resignation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As Oscar Wilde might have said, losing one minister as a result of a sex
scandal looks like misfortune; losing two looks like carelessness.
Mr Tim Yeo, who resigned yesterday as minister of state for the environment,
had admitted being the father of a child born last year to an unmarried Tory
councillor.
The scandal of his extra-marital affair was less salacious than that with an
actress that contributed to the downfall of Mr David Mellor as national
heritage secretary in 1992. It is also likely to be less damaging, since Mr
Yeo was not a member of the cabinet, although he was a competent and popular
junior minister who might have gone further.
However, the events leading to Mr Yeo's resignation raise awkward questions
about the credibility of the government's campaign for traditional family
values. The affair will also reinforce concern among Tory backbenchers about
the political judgment of Mr John Major, the prime minister.
Mr Major stood by Mr Mellor until it was clear that he could not survive
because of the weight of criticism in the party and the press. He gave
similar support to Mr Michael Mates before he was forced to resign as
Norther Ireland minister because of his friendship with Mr Asil Nadir, the
fugitive head of Polly Peck.
Downing Street said nothing when Mr Yeo's extra-marital affair became
public, but the prime minister's silence was widely interpreted as a gesture
of support. It also emerged that Mr Major knew about Mr Yeo's relationship
before it was revealed in the media, further strengthening the impression
that it was not regarded as a resignation issue.
In all three cases, the prime minister's motives were a combination of
loyalty to ministers and a disinclination to allow the media to decide the
composition of the government.
Like Baroness Thatcher when she was prime minister, Mr Major has taken the
view that private behaviour need not affect a minister's suitability for
office if it is unrelated to their job.
However, the Yeo affair has left the prime minister looking indecisive just
when government strategists had hoped he would begin to demonstrate that his
authority had recovered from last year's battering over Maastricht.
The damage is not confined to Mr Major. Sir Norman Fowler, the Conservative
chairman, and Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, also gave Mr Yeo
public support - which now looks ill-judged.
Some Conservative backbenchers were saying yesterday that Mr Major should
have sacked Mr Yeo when the relationship became public on Boxing Day. The
prime minister would have then made it clear that he was determined to
pursue the traditional family values which were the focus of his speech to
the party conference in October.
That would have dispelled the air of hypocrisy which has clung to the
government since it emerged that a minister who had called for a reduction
in the number of single parent families had helped create one.
This was the factor which prompted criticism of Mr Yeo from party officials
in his Suffolk South constituency, where members were unimpressed by his
promise to take financial responsibility for the child.
There is a great deal of sympathy for Mr Yeo among Conservative
backbenchers. Mr Peter Bottomley, a former minister, said his departure was
'deeply regrettable'.
Mr Major also indicated, in a warm response to Mr Yeo's resignation letter,
that he could return to the government after a period of penance on the back
benches. This would be in line with the precedent set by the then Mr Cecil
Parkinson, who resigned from the cabinet in similar circumstances in 1983 -
but returned after the 1987 election.
Several other ministers rumoured to have had affairs will be waiting
nervously for the next blow to fall. Much appears to depend on luck.
Mr Steven Norris, transport minister, appeared doomed last year when
newspapers alleged he was involved with five mistresses. But he survived
when attention switched to the party conference and the publication of Lady
Thatcher's memoirs.
The only safety lies in the old political rubric: don't get caught. As Oscar
Wilde also said, there is no sin except stupidity, at least for politicians.

UK house prices rose on average by 1.2 per cent last year, the first
increase since 1990 and the highest annual rise since 1989, Halifax,
Britain's biggest mortgage lender, reported yesterday.
The annual increase was less than half that reported by Nationwide building
society, which on Tuesday said prices last year had risen by 3.3 per cent.
Halifax said its survey would have shown a higher annual increase but for a
fall of 0.5 per cent in average house prices in December compared with
November.
December is traditionally one of the weakest periods for house sales in the
UK. Prices of new houses last month are estimated by the society to have
fallen by 2 per cent since the end of November.
Halifax said the effect of the latest fall meant that the average price of a
new home had declined by 0.5 per cent since December 1992. The figures,
however, do not measure the impact of sales incentives, such as subsidised
mortgages, which are being phased out gradually by builders as the market
recovers.
The figures are in marked contrast to those published by Nationwide, which
showed a 0.8 per cent rise for all types of houses in December.
The Halifax survey uses a larger sample of mortgage loans than does
Nationwide, and also included the whole of the extended Christmas holiday
period. Nationwide included mortgage offers up to December 22.
Halifax said yesterday: 'In spite of the fall in December, house prices have
generally become firmer in the second half of 1993. Although some
month-on-month falls remain possible over the winter, we continue to expect
the recovery to strengthen in 1994 and house prices to rise by about 5 per
cent over the course of the year.'
Halifax said that the price of an average home had risen from Pounds 61,169
to Pounds 61,928 during the past 12 months. The last annual price rise, in
1990, was 0.5 per cent while prices in 1989 rose by 2.8 per cent.
It said the yearly increase for 1993 was close to the last published annual
UK inflation rate of 1.4 per cent for November.
Halifax expects the number of sales - which are thought to have risen by
about 5 per cent in England and Wales last year - to rise by about 15 per
cent this year over the UK as whole.
The society said that UK house prices, even after last year's increase,
remain 11.5 per cent lower than during the summer of 1989. Price falls in
south-east England and East Anglia have been even greater, with the average
cost of a home declining by 27 per cent and 31 per cent respectively since
the end of 1989.
Even if prices were now to rise at an average of 5 per cent a year, it would
take until next century for many prices to get back to the levels prevailing
in the late 1980s.

FT  06 JAN 94 / Pleasure boat industry stays afloat: Manufacturers have
survived the recession by increasing sales abroad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The London Boat Show, which opens at Earls Court today, features a model of
the west coast of Scotland, complete with a working ferry and marinas.
The exhibit brings some novelty to the event, which in other respects is a
repeat of previous shows. For the past three years, manufacturers have been
arriving with the same message: trading conditions are dire but the British
leisure boat industry has survived by seeking out new export markets.
Sunseeker International, the UK's second-largest manufacturer, will be
showing off its new 63ft Predator, the largest boat it has built. Sunseeker
has sold five of the boats, at a price of Pounds 575,000 each.
One of the buyers was Venezuelan, one Mexican, one Malaysian and two North
American. The company is now selling 40 per cent of its output in North
America, compared with less than 3 per cent at the beginning of the 1990s.
Despite downturns in demand the UK boat building industry, the largest in
Europe, has largely survived.
The number employed in the industry and associated services such as marinas
has fallen to 18,000 from just under 20,000 in 1990, according to Mr Tony
Beechey, chairman of the British Marine Industries Federation. He adds that
only 2 per cent of the federation's 1,250 members have gone out of business
since the recession began.
The Southampton Boat Show last September provided the first indications that
UK buyers were returning. But Mr Robert Braithwaite, Sunseeker's managing
director, says that two months later the market appeared to die again.
The London show, which brings buyers from around the world, should provide
some indication of whether the international market is reviving. It forms
part of the international circuit of large boat shows that began in Paris
last December and moves on, over the next three months, to Dusseldorf and
Miami.
British boat builders have also travelled to the smaller shows in search of
orders. When Dubai held its first show last May UK boat build-ers formed the
biggest contingent.
The UK industry's strength is the small and entrepreneurial nature of its
companies, says Mr Nigel Musto, sales director of Musto, an Essex-based
concern that manufactures sailing clothing.
While shipbuilding in the UK has declined, the manufacture of pleasure boats
and accessories has survived because it is staffed by enthusiasts. 'Nobody
likes to walk into the yacht club, where we spend half our lives, to be told
that someone has come out with a better product than ours,' Mr Musto says.
The industry does suffer, however, from the weakness of other sectors of UK
manufacturing. Mr David King, managing director of Marine Projects, the UK's
biggest boat maker, says he has to import his power boat engines from
abroad.

FT  06 JAN 94 / Foreigners believe London is a safe city
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Foreign visitors to London regard it as a safe and clean city, although some
see it as too expensive, according to research carried out for the British
Tourist Authority.
Interviews with 1,210 foreign visitors to London last summer found that only
1 per cent were worried about their personal safety in the city.
This contrasts strongly with research carried out last year which indicated
that a large number of UK residents regarded London as a dangerous city to
visit. The research by Lunn Poly, the travel agents' chain, found that more
than 70 per cent of UK residents surveyed thought it was more dangerous to
visit London than travel abroad.
Litter, another common complaint by Londoners and UK visitors, was mentioned
as a problem by only 2 per cent in the authority's survey.
More than 40 per cent of the foreign visitors said they had experienced no
problems, but of the 57 per cent who had problems, 15 per cent thought
London was expensive.
Asked what they saw as London's attractions, 69 per cent mentioned the
city's heritage.

FT  06 JAN 94 / Institutions grow cooler towards Independent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The main institutional share-holders in Newspaper Publishing, the holding
company for The Independent and the Independent on Sunday, have made it
clear that they do not want to put more money into the group.
Institutional shareholders, which include Standard Life, Scottish Amicable
and the Prudential, hold 52 per cent of the lossmaking business.
Most favour cashing in their chips during the planned re-financing, although
some may want to retain an interest in potential future profits of the
company.
Their unwillingness to invest further narrows the options for Newspaper
Publishing and concentrates the search on potential trade investors.
The search comes at the same time as approval of a business plan that
envisages a return to profit in the 1994-95 financial year and more
substantial profits the year after. The company lost Pounds 486,000 pre-tax
in the year to September, most of it because of the abortive attempt to buy
The Observer.
The business plan promises editorial improvements, a sustained marketing
campaign, improving the money raised by advertising and stringent cost
controls which will include 'modest' staff cuts.
Mr Andreas Whittam Smith, the main founder of The Independent, and two
newspaper investors - El Pas of Spain and La Repubblica of Italy - favour
bringing on board one of four national newspaper groups: Mr Conrad Black's
Telegraph Group, Mirror Group Newspapers; Lord Rothermere's Associated
Newspapers; or United Newspapers, publishers of the Daily Express.
No deal has been concluded yet and no talks have been held with United. Mr
Black is a clear option but MGN, now emerging from the financial
difficulties caused by the late Robert Maxwell, is increasingly seen as a
serious runner.
Journalists on the papers yesterday demanded immediate disclosure of the
company's business plan and immediate representation on the board.
Meanwhile the non-executive directors under chairman Mr Ian Hay Davison are
pursuing alternatives.
Mr Hay Davison has made it clear that the non-executive directors intend to
fulfil their legal obligation to get the best deal possible for
shareholders, staff and readers.
This group is also pursuing potential trade investors.
Mr Michael Green's Carlton Communications is now seen as unlikely to invest
although another group with television interests, Lord Hollick's MAI, is
still a possibility.
Competing proposals for future investors could go before a board meeting at
the end of this month.
Forty-four jobs are to be lost out of an editorial total of 220 on the
Scottish Daily Record and Sunday Mail, the company told journalists'
representatives yesterday.
A journalists' spokesman said: 'The management told us they are wanting
talks to restructure the company which would lead to a reduction of some 44
editorial people.'
Production of the two mass-circulation tabloids is to move from central
Glasgow later this year to a new plant. Senior executives at Mirror Group
Newspapers, which owns the two Scots titles, said last night that the job
losses were part of an 'upgrading' of staff in which new journalists would
be appointed.

FT  06 JAN 94 / Official reserves shrink by Dollars 674m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK's official reserves fell by Dollars 674m in December to stand at
Dollars 42.93bn at the year end, the Treasury announced.
The main reason for the fall was the Treasury's decision to repay the Ecu5bn
(Dollars 5.6bn) revolving bank credit arranged in September 1992 to support
the pound.

FT  06 JAN 94 / Secretaries' skills 'being wasted'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Two out of three secretaries say they would rather be doing another job and
many believe their skills and qualifications are being wasted by companies
which ignore their potential, a report says today.
Type Cast, the report of a survey of 540 secretaries and 396 managers
published today by the Industrial Society, concludes that work
dissatisfaction among secretaries is rife.
The society described secretaries and administrative staff as 'the most
undervalued, under-utilised and under-developed section of the 90s
workforce'. Nearly half the secretaries questioned said they wanted
management careers.

FT  06 JAN 94 / Falling demand to shut steel plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Steel will cease manufacture of large diameter seamless tube in
April when it closes its Bromford works at Erdington, near Birmingham, with
the loss of 330 jobs, Andrew Taylor writes.
British Steel said the closure was the result of competition from more
modern plant as well as world over-capacity for this type of tube, which is
used mainly for power generation and process plant.
It said that the 75-year-old Bromford works had been making losses for
several years. The plant, which has a capacity to produce 50,000 tonnes a
year, had tried to cut costs and improve efficiency. Even so losses had
risen.
The factory sells mainly in the UK and continental Europe, but demand had
fallen leaving it with 'a severe order shortage'.
The company said it would be offering job transfers to as many as possible
of the threatened Bromford workers - but could not rule out some compulsory
redundancies.

FT  06 JAN 94 / Sinn Fein to push for peace talks with Major
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BELFAST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, is to write to Mr John Major, the
prime minister, to press home his calls for direct talks with the British
government on last month's Downing Street declaration.
Mr Adams said last night that the 'various interpretations' of the
declaration illustrated the need for 'full and frank' clarification of the
key issues.
Mr Major's 'present policy of addressing republicans through the columns of
newspapers' was 'a childish nonsense and . . . grossly irresponsible', he
said.
Downing Street said it would study Mr Adams' letter - but officials pointed
out that Mr Major has repeatedly ruled out any talks with Sinn Fein in
advance of acceptance of the joint declaration.
Mr Adams' statement overshadowed an increasingly heated war of words between
politicians in the province over the failure of republican leaders to date
to say definitively whether they will embrace the UK-Irish peace initiative.
The row erupted after Mr James Molyneaux, the Ulster Unionist party leader,
made it clear on Tuesday night that he thought the IRA had already in effect
rejected the declaration.
Mr Molyneaux's unexpectedly downbeat remarks were immediately criticised by
Mr John Hume, leader of the mainly Roman Catholic Social Democratic and
Labour party, and by Mr Adams.
But in Dublin, Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, made a point of
praising the statesmanship displayed by Mr Molyneaux while urging republican
leaders to renounce their 25-year armed struggle.
Speaking to the Irish Labour party's general council, Mr Spring appealed for
patience but said: 'We must keep sending the message again and again that
the causes - or excuses - behind the so-called armed struggle have ceased to
have any relevance for anyone on this island.'
Mr Spring said the armed struggle would 'never persuade, or achieve any form
of willing consent'.
Mr Adams yesterday referred to the British government's 'hypocrisy and
cynicism' and claimed it was 'in reality seeking a public justification for
a renewed onslaught on Irish nationalists'. He added: 'This is clearly the
Unionist objective.'
Mr Ken Maginnis, Ulster Unionist security spokesman, said: 'One is left to
wonder whether this is just posturing by Mr Adams in line with what appears
to be a pessimistic attitude emanating from the nationalist community.'

FT  06 JAN 94 / To ban or not to ban
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Irish cabinet held its first meeting of the new year yesterday without
reaching a final decision on whether to drop the Republic's broadcasting ban
on Sinn Fein - the political wing of the IRA - and other listed
organisations.
Officials said the matter was discussed at the meeting, but no final
decision was taken. The order enshrining the ban is due to expire on January
19.
A broad consensus within the cabinet is understood to favour discarding the
ban.
Any such move would come at a sensitive time, however, and would almost
certainly be criticised by unionists as a concession to the IRA.
Mr Peter Brooke, national heritage secretary, is due to report on a review
of British restrictions this month. An early decision to remove them is
unlikely.

Teachers' unions yesterday appeared deeply divided in their reaction to Sir
Ron Dearing's report on the national curriculum, signalling that the
government had at last broken the profession's united front over the issue.
However, a repeated boycott of national curriculum tests, similar to the
industrial action which forced the education department to start Sir Ron's
review last April, remains a real possibility.
Last year the tests were boycotted by all the three main teachers' unions
while the two organisations for head teachers, who were contractually barred
from boycotting the tests, made no attempt to administer tests against the
wishes of their staff.
Mr David Hart, general secretary of the NAHT head teachers' union, said: 'I
fear the report will find the teaching profession disunited. Heads are
perhaps going to have to administer the tests this year with a profession
which is not necessarily united behind the boycott or behind the tests.'
He implored teachers to look on the report as 'a great professional
victory'. Mr Malcolm Hewitt, president of the SHA head teachers' union,
said: 'Now nobody can complain they haven't been consulted.'
But Mr Doug McAvoy, general secretary of the biggest teaching union the NUT,
said: 'Sadly Sir Ron recommends no changes to the assessment and testing
arrangements for this year and beyond. The tests will continue to be used
for school comparison and league table purposes - purposes to which we are
fundamentally opposed.'
He said the NUT's boycott would continue because the tests and statutory
assessments 'cause additional and unnecessary work, are not supportive of
learning, and are of no value to parents'.
Mr Peter Smith, general secretary of the ATL union, said, however, that if
teachers rejected the report 'we might never be consulted again'. He said:
'It is clear that the tests are now to be shorter and easier to administer.
There is absolutely no reason why the 1994 tests in English, maths and
science should not go ahead.'
A meeting of NASUWT's executive at the weekend will decide whether to lift
the boycott. The likelihood according to the union's general secretary, Mr
Nigel de Gruchy, is that some parts of the boycott will be lifted, but
NASUWT members may continue their action against tests in some subjects.
Mr de Gruchy gave the proposals a broad welcome, saying the curriculum as
proposed yesterday was 'virtually unrecognisable from the Byzantine
bureaucratic monster imposed by Kenneth Baker'.
He added that the NASUWT's dispute was always about excessive workload and,
unlike the NUT's, was 'never based upon a philosophical objection to
testing'.
Soundings of union members by their leaderships in the next few weeks will
be crucial. The NUT has a mandate for a boycott, members having voted by a
20-to-one majority to continue with the action last November. It will make
an 'in-depth' consultation with members over the next month, and may decide
to lift the boycott. The ATL must re-ballot its members before the boycott
can be called off.

<TEXT>
The final heats in the competition to be the English city that bids to stage
the Commonwealth Games of 2002 began yesterday when Manchester published the
bid it hopes will defeat rivals London and Sheffield.
The Commonwealth Games Council for England will choose between the three on
February 2. The winner will have until November next year to persuade the
federation of similar councils throughout the Commonwealth to award the
games to England.
New Delhi, Nairobi, Cape Town and a Caribbean city are all likely contenders
for 2002, but the 50th anniversary of the Queen's accession is seen as a
powerful selling point by all three English hopefuls.
The London bid is led by the private sector but stems from London First,
part of the government's experimental city pride partnership scheme to
stimulate regeneration. The Wembley stadium and arena complex are expected
to figure.
Sheffield's bid relies on the stadium, swimming pool and arena built for the
World Student Games of 1991.
Manchester is bidding with almost the same team that failed to win the 2000
Olympics. It will have Europe's biggest arena and a covered cycling stadium
ready next year.

FT  06 JAN 94 / Employers welcome vocational proposals: CBI pinpoints
weaknesses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Ron Dearing's vision of schoolchildren being able to embark on
vocational studies at the age of 14, with paths to a number of post-16
options including the government's proposed 'modern apprenticeship',
received a warm welcome in principle from employers yesterday.
The proposal could bring the UK more in line with many Continental schools
where the opportunity to study vocational subjects, within a broad
education, is widely available for pupils younger than 16.
Sir Ron said yesterday: 'It will be a particular challenge to establish how
a vocational pathway which maintains a broad educational component might be
established . . . over the next few years as part of a 14-to-19 continuum.'
At present there are no vocational courses specifically catering for
14-year-olds. Sir Ron is asking the School Curriculum and Assessment
Authority to work alongside the National Council for Vocational
Qualifications in developing vocational options.
The working of the two bodies together may meet some of the recent criticism
of the council's National Vocational Qualifications, which are generally
acquired in the workplace, and its General National Vocational
Qualifications, which are mainly an alternative to A-levels for students in
full-time education.
Professor Alan Smithers and his team from Manchester University's Centre for
Education and Employment criticised such qualifications in a recent report.
Yesterday Prof Smithers welcomed the Dearing report in principle, saying it
made raising the skill levels of vocational qualifications more urgent.
The Confederation of British Industry also welcomed the proposals and said:
'Vocational courses have the potential to raise standards, but they are not
an easy option.'
The CBI identified two weaknesses that had to be addressed if vocational
options were to succeed: teachers would have to be trained to deliver them
and students would have to be given access to top quality careers guidance
to enable them to make informed choices.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Aer Rianta, the state-backed company which runs Ireland's main airports, has
won the contract to run duty-free shops at both ends of the Channel tunnel.
Duty-free sales are expected to account for most non-travel revenues from
Eurotunnel's operations. They are estimated at Pounds 18m this year, rising
to Pounds 46m in 1996.
Mr Derek Keogh, chief executive, said Aer Rianta had fought off strong
international competition to win the deal. Its shops will cover an area of
400 sq m at each end of the tunnel.

FT  06 JAN 94 / Talks on internal row at AEEU
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Talks are to be held today among leaders of the AEEU in an effort to resolve
a dispute between the merged engineering and electrical sections of the
union.
The dispute came to a head before Christmas when engineering leaders walked
out of a meeting on the drawing-up of the union's new rule book.
The argument is centred on the different cultures and traditions of the two
unions which merged in 1992. The former engineering union is defending its
strong democratic foundation against the centralist executive-led style of
the old electricians' union.
Finance has proved another source of rancour between the two sections. The
engineers have been anxious to see the sale of Buxted Park, the old
electricians' union's training centre in East Sussex.
Mr Paul Gallagher, head of the electricians' section, said yesterday: 'We
are committed to the arrangement and making it work. So far it's working
remarkably well given the potential difficulties we have had.'

FT  06 JAN 94 / Gould attacks Labour policies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Bryan Gould, who mounted an unsuccessful challenge for the Labour
leadership in 1992, is poised to launch a fierce challenge to the party's
economic policies, it was reported today.
Tribune, the left-wing weekly newspaper, said Mr Gould's Full Employment
Forum was about to launch a manifesto accusing Mr John Smith, the party
leader, of paying mere 'lip service' to full employment.
The document calls for a refusal to meet Britain's Maastricht Treaty
commitments, tax increases for the very rich, increased borrowing, an
immediate cut in interest rates to 2 per cent or 3 per cent and effective
devaluation of sterling. It claims these steps would double projected UK
economic growth to 4 per cent.
Mr Alistair Darling, Labour party Treasury spokesman, said: 'The criticism
of John Smith's commitment to full employment is astonishing and completely
unjustified.'

FT  06 JAN 94 / Former banker to sue over BCCI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sheikh Khalid bin Mahfouz, former chief operating officer of the National
Commercial Bank of Saudi Arabia, is preparing to sue the government of Abu
Dhabi in connection with the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce
International, writes Andrew Jack.
In a writ expected to be lodged very soon, perhaps today, in London's High
Court, Sheikh Khalid calls for damages of several billion dollars and
alleges conspiracy and deception against him by the Abu Dhabi Investment
Authority and senior officials in the government, the majority shareholder
in BCCI.
The action calls for an indemnity against Sheikh Khalid in the case of any
award against him as the result of a Dollars 10.5bn lawsuit brought by the
liquidators to BCCI against him and National Commercial Bank (NCB).
It also demands a permanent injunction against an alleged continuing
conspiracy between Abu Dhabi and other parties including the liquidators to
BCCI against Sheikh Khalid.
The government of Abu Dhabi said last night: 'This appears to be an attempt
to divert attention from the liquidators' case against Mahfouz.'
At the end of last month Sheikh Khalid concluded a settlement in which he
paid Dollars 225m (Pounds 151.3m) in exchange for a waiver of fraud and
racketeering charges against him brought by Mr Robert Morgenthau, the New
York district attorney.

FT  06 JAN 94 / The Dearing Report: Main recommendations
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Dearing Report ushers in sweeping changes to the national curriculum:
Only English, maths and science, plus 'short courses' in technology and a
modern language, will be compulsory after the age of 14. History and
geography will no longer be mandatory.
14-year-olds will now be allowed to consider vocational courses as part of
the extra choice provided to them. Sir Ron suggests these should fit with
the general national vocational qualifications now being introduced for
16-year-olds to create a '14-to-19 continuum' of courses.
A new curriculum will be introduced for technology from 1996, and the
subject will not be compulsory for 14-year-olds this year or next.
The curriculum for five to 14-year-olds will be 'slimmed down' by dividing
the content of each subject into a central 'core' and more optional
material.
The total proportion of school time to be devoted to the curriculum will be
reduced to 80 per cent - some teachers claim that until now it has required
more than 100 per cent of the time available.
The remaining time each week can be used at schools' discretion, although
teachers' prime concern should be 'to support work in the basics of
literacy, oracy and numeracy'.
English, maths and science - the 'core subjects' will be left intact but the
content of others will be cut, particularly in primary schools.
The number of statements of achievement on which teachers must assess
children will be reduced to avoid the 'excessive detail' of the current
approach, and allow scope to ease teachers' workloads.
The '10-level scale' which measures all pupils on a common basis from the
ages of five to 16 will be abandoned from the age of 14, but retained for
younger ages.
There will be no further changes to the national curriculum orders for at
least five years following the review.

FT  06 JAN 94 / National curriculum: A history lesson
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
1988
Mr Kenneth Baker, education secretary, pilots the most ambitious package of
reforms since the war through the House. His Education Reform Act allows
schools to opt out of local authority control, and establishes a national
curriculum for England and Wales.
After arguments with Mrs Margaret Thatcher, which both have now recounted in
their memoirs, Mr Baker ensures a comprehensive national curriculum
including English, mathematics, science, technology, a modern language,
religious education, art, history, geography and physical education, to be
compulsory from the age of five through to 16. Mrs Thatcher had favoured a
curriculum covering only the 'basics' of English and mathematics.
Pupils are to be tested at the end of four 'key stages' - at the ages of
seven, 11, 14, and 16. Education department officials form working parties
to decide on the curriculum for each subject, while the Schools Examinations
and Assessment Council decides how they should be assessed. The resulting
tests are based on 'standard attainment targets', and are designed to be
part of a continuously assessed curriculum.
1991
Mr Kenneth Clarke, education secretary, announces plans to publish 'league
tables' of schools' results, based on their pupils' performance in national
curriculum tests, and in GCSE exams.
The first tests for seven-year-olds take place. Mr Clarke announces plans to
'streamline' them for the following year, after teachers complain they are
too time-consuming, and appoints Lord Griffiths, then chairman of the
Thatcherite Centre for Policy Studies, to chair the SEAC. His brief is to
introduce simple 'paper and pencil' tests.
1993: The Boycott
All three teachers' unions vote to boycott the national curriculum tests,
objecting both to the workload the tests create, and their educational
content.
In April, Mr John Patten, now education secretary, appoints Sir Ron Dearing
to carry out a review. Four weeks later, Patten announces concessions on
testing from 1994 onwards, abandoning plans to test subjects other than
English, maths and science.
The boycott goes ahead in June, with almost total support from teachers. In
August, the government accepts Sir Ron's interim findings, which give
teacher assessment greater weight, and reduce the proportion of school time
prescribed by the curriculum to between 75 and 85 per cent. All plans for
league tables of seven-year-olds and 14-year-olds are scrapped.
1994
Sir Ron confirms his earlier findings, and makes recommendations which
entail the total abandonment in all but name of the national curriculum
after the age of 14. Mr Patten accepts the findings.

FT  06 JAN 94 / Political jury still out on Patten's survival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
By accepting the recom-mendations of the Dearing report, Mr John Patten,
education secretary, hopes to put an end to the controversy over plans for a
national curriculum in Britain's schools.
But it was far from clear yesterday whether he has managed to salvage his
political fortunes, even if he has ditched some of the government's
unpopular proposals.
Mr Patten was praised by some Tory backbenchers yesterday for warding off
further political damage and scaling back the ambitions of successive
education secretaries to establish a broad-ranging national curriculum for
five-to-16-year-olds.
'The national curriculum proposals were a corset that was reined in so
tightly that things started to pop out,' said Sir Malcolm Thornton, Tory
chairman of the all-party select committee on education. 'I can feel a lot
of sympathy for John Patten because he inherited a situation that had
started to get out of control.'
Mr John MacGregor, former education secretary and now transport secretary,
also claimed the changes had finally put education policy back on the right
road.
'It was always likely that the biggest and most fundamental educational
reform for decades would need to be refined in the light of experience,' he
said.
But when the Commons returns next week Mr Patten could come under fire for
having responded too slowly to criticism of the plans to broaden the
curriculum and introduce tests.
One backbench Tory MP said: 'If there was failure on his part, it was not to
engage the problems soon enough.' He was particularly critical of Mr
Patten's determination to try and push through a national curriculum for
14-year-olds last autumn, even though it was clear that the overwhelming
majority of parents, teachers and unions were against it.
Moreover, the secretary of state may also face new difficulties this year as
he tries to steer the education bill through parliament and continues to
give school governors increasing autonomy over their finances.
The education bill, which would create a new teacher training agency and
reduce the powers of student unions, was subjected to thunderous opposition
during its second reading in the House of Lords late last year.
Mrs Ann Taylor, shadow education secretary, said: 'The government wants to
give schools control over up to 90 per cent of their funds, but schools are
saying they don't want that much responsibility.'
Amid all these difficulties, the prime minister might still be reluctant to
move Mr Patten this summer if there is a reshuffle. But one influential Tory
backbencher said yesterday: 'The prime minister's inclination will probably
be to leave John in place for as long as possible. But if he runs into
stormy weather on the education bill over the next few months, that may
prove impossible.'

FT  06 JAN 94 / Power bidding system drives pool prices down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Prices in the electricity trading pool in England and Wales fell yesterday
by about Pounds 250,000, or 1 per cent of the total, as a mechanism aimed at
reducing power bills began to take effect.
The fall will be welcomed by the pool executive and electricity companies
which introduced the system, known as demand-side bidding, in spite of
protests from large energy users, including Imperial Chemical Industries,
which claimed the system was unnecessarily complicated and of limited value
to the large companies whose participation was necessary to make it work.
Professor Stephen Littlechild, electricity industry regulator, last month
rejected their appeal for the scheme to be replaced by one which gave
greater incentive to take part.
The pool's system, intended as a three-month experiment, was introduced on
Christmas eve with five companies taking part.
The demand-side bidders agree to cut their intake of electricity if the
price rises above a certain level, which they specify.
The National Grid treats demand-side participants as if they were generators
when it works out pool prices for the day ahead. Demand-side bidders have an
effect if their bid price is the 'most marginal' on the system, that is when
their bid is the most expensive of the generating units or the equivalent
needed to keep the system working.
Yesterday demand-side bidding made an impact in two of the 48 half-hour
periods for which pool prices are determined daily, the pool said.
The Pounds 250,000 saving was shared pro rata among all consumers.
Some large energy users had argued against the system because they thought
demand-side participants should have been given a larger share of the
benefit than electricity users that did not bid.
The system which the pool has introduced provides participants with an
availability payment if the bid they make does not affect prices. The pool
said the payment for an average company bidding in each of the 48 half-hours
yesterday would have been about Pounds 500.
The participating companies are Allied Steel &amp; Wire and Alphasteel, both
based in south Wales, Cleveland Potash, Bridgewater Paper, in the Wirrall,
and Hays Chemical Distribution, in Cheshire.
The pool said yesterday that ICI and Sheerness Steel had applied to become
demand-side bidders. Present arrangements allow up to 10 companies to take
part in the experiment, although the pool hopes to expand this number.
The price changes will have an immediate effect on large companies which buy
their electricity directly from the pool. Household consumers will see no
change in their bills as their supplies are covered by long-term contracts
protected by hedging arrangements.

FT  06 JAN 94 / Three cities slug it out in heats for Commonwealth Games
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The final heats in the competition to be the English city which bids to
stage the Commonwealth Games of 2002 began yesterday when Manchester
published the bid it hopes will defeat rivals London and Sheffield.
The Commonwealth Games Council for England will choose between the three on
February 2. The winner will have until November next year to persuade the
federation of similar councils throughout the Commonwealth to award the
games to England, which last hosted them in 1934 in London. In the meantime
the games have been staged in Scotland twice (Edinburgh in 1970 and 1986)
and Wales (Cardiff in 1958).
New Delhi, Nairobi, Cape Town and a Caribbean city are all likely contenders
for 2002, but the 50th anniversary of the Queen's accession is seen as a
powerful selling point by all three English hopefuls. They also see the
bidding process as part of their general marketing and development strategy
to help raise their profiles.
The London bid is led by the private sector but stems from London First,
part of the government's experimental city pride partnership scheme to
stimulate regeneration. The Wembley stadium and arena complex are expected
to figure, but new international-class swimming facilities would have to be
built.
Sheffield University is co-ordinating its city's bid, supported by the city
council. It relies on the 24,000-seat stadium, swimming pool and 12,000-seat
arena built by the council for the World Student Games of 1991 - a financial
embarrassment for local taxpayers, who will be paying for the facilities
until 2010.
Professor Gareth Roberts, Sheffield University vice-chancellor, said that if
the city won the English heat the university would put together a
partnership of leading figures to run the project. No council money would be
spent.
Manchester is bidding with almost the same team which failed to win the 2000
Olympics. It will have an arena - Europe's biggest - and a covered cycling
stadium ready next year, but would have to build a stadium and swimming
pool.
Sir Robert Scott, the bid leader, said plans for a new stadium would be
announced on January 28. His team, from both the public and private sectors,
feels there should be a 65,000-seat 'Wembley of the north' to serve as a
national stadium, whatever the outcome of its bid.
Sir Robert said experience suggested that a full-scale bid for the
Commonwealth Games would cost the winning city about Pounds 1m. He was
confident Manchester could raise this entirely from the private sector. He
has support from chairmen or chief executives at Coats Viyella, Amec,
Manchester Airport and the Co-operative Bank.

FT  06 JAN 94 / Scots newspapers to cut 220 jobs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Forty-four jobs are to be lost out of an editorial total of 220 on the
Scottish Daily Record and Sunday Mail, the company told journalists'
representatives yesterday.
A journalists' spokesman said: 'The management told us they are wanting
talks to restructure the company which would lead to a reduction of some 44
editorial people ultimately.'
Senior executives at Mirror Group Newspapers, which own the two Scots
titles, said last night said the job losses were part of an 'upgrading' of
staff in which new journalists would be appointed.

FT  06 JAN 94 / Options for paper group narrow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The main institutional shareholders in Newspaper Publishing, the holding
company for The Independent and the Independent on Sunday, have made clear
that they do not want to put more money into the group, Raymond Snoddy
writes.
Institutional shareholders - which include Standard Life, Scottish Amicable
and the Prudential - hold 52 per cent of the loss-making business.
Their unwillingness to invest more narrows the options for Newspaper
Publishing and concentrates the search on potential trade investors.
The search comes at the same time as approval of a business plan that
envisages a return to profit in the 1994-95 financial year with serious
profits the year after. The company lost Pounds 486,000 pre-tax in the year
to September.
The business plan promises editorial improvements, a sustained marketing
campaign, improving the money raised by advertising and stringent cost
control which will include 'modest' across-the-board cuts in staffing.
Mr Andreas Whittam Smith, the main founder of The Independent, and two
newspaper investors - El Pais of Spain and La Repubblica of Italy - favour
bringing on board one of four national newspaper groups, Mr Conrad Black's
Telegraph Group, Mirror Group Newspapers, Lord Rothermere's Associated
Newspapers or United Newspapers, publishers of the Daily Express.
No deal has been concluded yet and no talks have been held with United. Mr
Black is a clear option but MGN, now emerging from the financial
difficulties caused by the late Robert Maxwell, is increasingly seen as a
serious runner.

FT  06 JAN 94 / World Trade News: Asia to be focusfor investment - Strong
yen spurs shift to offshore production
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Strong Japanese interest in investing in China, south-east Asia and the
fast-growing Asian 'tiger' economies is forecast to revive the country's
foreign investment flows by 1995, according to a survey by Japan's
Export-Import Bank.
The revival is being driven by companies in the electronics, chemicals and
motor vehicle sectors, the survey reveals. The strong yen, which has raised
the cost of domestic production, has spurred many companies to make plans to
shift production off-shore.
The survey, conducted by Jexim's Research Institute of Overseas Investment,
covered over 330 companies. It showed that foreign direct investment in the
manufacturing sector had fallen sharply since recession struck in 1990 and
was likely to continue falling this year before turning up in 1995.
Actual foreign direct investment by the 222 companies giving full details
for 1992 and 1993 showed a 25 per cent fall, from an aggregate of Y985bn to
Y736bn. Jexim predicts a more modest 6.4 per cent fall in 1994 based on
estimates received in its latest survey companies.
For the first time in five years, the survey revealed an increase in the
number of companies admitting they have plans to invest overseas during the
coming three years. From 1989, when almost 84 per cent of companies had such
plans, the 'bursting of the bubble economy' swept this total down to 54 per
cent.
In the latest survey, just over 59 per cent of companies said they had
medium-term foreign investment plans.
While the recovery in foreign investment brings Japan nowhere near the boom
years of the second half of the 1980s, Jexim points to different reasons for
the revival - and different target destinations, mainly in Asia.
Most striking of all is the focus on China. Almost 92 per cent of companies
have plans to invest in China over the next three years.
A total of 150 Japanese companies named China in their top five investment
destinations, compared with just 65 for the US, 63 for Indonesia, 51 for
Vietnam, and 49 for Thailand. Just 18 companies named the UK and Germany in
their top five destinations.
The main force behind this renewed strength appears to be the positive
investment intentions of companies in the vehicle and electric/electronic
industries in such countries as China, Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and the
Asean countries. The survey says: 'Their motives are to seize export bases
for their products to be sold in foreign markets including Japan -
undoubtedly spurred by the abrupt appreciation of the yen in the first half
of 1993.'
More than 70 per cent of companies in the electrical machinery sector now
plan to raise foreign investment, compared with just 36 per cent a year
earlier. Over 73 per cent of motor manufacturers have similar plans,
compared with 52 per cent at the end of 1992.
By contrast, none of Japan's big five iron and steel manufacturers have
medium-term foreign investment plans - a clear reflection of chronic global
oversupply.
'Investment to advanced countries is suffering the dampening effects of the
declines in sales and profits, as well as the acute cost increases of parts
imported from Japan,' says the survey.
'Companies may well have to adopt short- to mid-term investment programmes
to expand sales bases and increase local content.'

<TEXT>
Japan's leading trading houses, discouraged by lower than expected
investments and business chances, are reviewing their operations in eastern
Europe.
Initially, its trading companies rushed to set up offices in the region,
following the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the eastern bloc's
communist regimes. However, investment in the reconstruction of Europe by
Japanese companies has remained inactive, as Japan's economy has
deteriorated over the past two years.
Treuhand, the German privatisation agency, was forced to closed its Tokyo
office last year, due to the reluctance of Japanese companies to invest in
former East German companies.
Mitsubishi, the largest trading house, closed down its representative office
in Bucharest last October, assigning its Vienna office to look after
business in Romania. Nissho Iwai, which currently has seven offices in east
European cities, said it would gradually reduce the number of its operations
during the year.
The traders' sluggish business has been caused by a fall in imports due to
the diminishing purchasing power of local governments as foreign currency
reserves have fallen.
'There are far less joint ventures with western countries than we initially
anticipated, and business conditions seemed to have worsened since there is
no aid from Russia,' said Nissho Iwai.
Meanwhile, Itochu said it was still seeing strong growth in Hungary and the
former Czechoslovakia.
However the company said it would have to start reviewing other East
European operations if the current economic environment in the region
continued.

FT  06 JAN 94 / World Trade News: Risk-taking wins a cheer at Eximbank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kenneth Brody, chairman of the US Export-Import Bank, after his first
year in office, is demonstrating that risk-takers from Wall Street can
settle comfortably in the orbit of the 'pro-active' Clinton White House.
A chief player in the development of the administration's aggressive export
promotion strategy, former investment banker is now focusing on Eximbank's
role within that policy.
Where the agency can make a difference, he has concluded, is on ventures
which businesses cannot afford themselves and which commercial banks will
not touch without US government backing.
Many of these risks will be directed towards the former Soviet Union, where
Eximbank recently concluded a long-awaited Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.35bn) Oil
and Gas Framework to boost rehabilitation of existing production facilities.
To supplement the pact, Mr Brody and his counterparts signed a Project
Incentive Agreement to provide financing for new energy projects as well as
loans in sectors such as mining and forest products.
Not deterred by the recent Russian election results, Mr Brody, in fact,
looks on the bright side. That President Boris Yeltsin did not sack his
reformers or halt privatisation efforts is deemed 'interesting' and, in any
case, designing 'appropriate safety nets' for Russians caught up in the
transition to a market economy is considered desirable.
Eximbank this year has no loan limit and Congress has authorised almost
Dollars 1bn - including Dollars 300m for the former Soviet republics - to
pay the costs of financing. This means the bank could leverage up to Dollars
18bn for guarantees, insurance and direct loans. But the chairman seems less
concerned by the quantity of loans than the challenge of designing loans for
shrewd deals which others might sidestep.
He is boosting project finance, exports of environmental goods and services
and small business exports. He has established a special group for aircraft
finance.
Much effort is going in a shift on customer services. Preliminary financing
commitments, which once took an average of six weeks to issue, are turning
around more swiftly; half the applicants are getting answers in 7 1/2 days.
Eximbank has Dollars 150m this year to counter the tied aid deals - mingling
commercial credits with government aid - offered by US competitors. Just a
few have been offered so far (including one 'substantial' deal for China),
but last year the use of tied aid fell dramatically - from Dollars 15bn in
1991 to Dollars 6bn. Mr Brody expects to compete aggressively in the world's
emerging markets, where the greatest growth is expected. He envisions more
tied aid activity, project finance and substantially more product activity
in China.

FT  06 JAN 94 / World Trade News: Malaysia purchase for Laing
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
John Laing, the UK construction group, has acquired a 5 per cent stake in
YTL Power Generation, which has been contracted to build and operate two
privately financed power stations in Malaysia where it is based.
International construction companies increasingly are acquiring stakes in
ventures involved in private infrastructure projects to increase their share
of this work.
Laing, which has been appointed project manager for building and civil
engineering works of two gas turbine combined cycle power stations at Pasir
Gudang and Paka, is paying MDollars 45m (Pounds 12m) for 5 per cent of the
ordinary and redeemable preference shares of YTL. The construction contract
to Laing is worth just MDollars 17m. Laing said its decision was 'a further
step in the group's strategy of increasing involvement in private
infrastructure projects worldwide.'
The two power stations, costing a combined MDollars 3.5bn, are due to be
completed next year. The first dividends are expected to be paid to
shareholders in 1997.

FT  06 JAN 94 / World Trade News: Pounds 150m Brazil deal for Westland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Westland, the UK helicopter manufacturer, has clinched a Pounds 150m order
from the Brazilian navy after protracted contract discussions and strong
French and US competition.
Mr Alan Jones, Westland's chief executive, said the contract for nine Super
Lynx helicopters was the result of more than four years of effort.
The deal includes refurbishment and updating of the Brazilian navy's five
existing Lynx helicopters. Other contenders for the contract were the
Franco-German Eurocopter joint venture and Kaman of the US.
Together with a recent contract with Norway to supply two Sea King
search-and-rescue helicopters, the order helps to compensate Westland for
the loss of Pounds 400m worth of work on naval helicopters for Canada. The
new Canadian government announced in November it was cancelling plans to buy
43 Anglo-Italian EH101 helicopters worth Pounds 2.4bn.
The EH101, on which Westland's future is largely pinned, is now on order
only for the UK. Italy is expected to place a production contract in the
next few months.
Westland's order book stands at about Pounds 1.55bn following the Brazilian
deal. Production of the helicopters is to start this year, helping to fill
spare capacity before EH101 production work builds up in 1996.
The twin-engine Lynx, developed more than 20 years ago under an Anglo-French
collaborative programme, remains a strong export prospect for the UK
company.
Brazil is the third customer for the upgraded Super Lynx version, already in
service in South Korea and Portugal. Mr Jones said further Lynx sales were
under discussion in the Far East and the Middle East.
Helicopter sales are among prospective deals which Mr Malcolm Rifkind, UK
defence secretary, is due to discuss during a tour of the Gulf region this
week. Mr Rifkind will visit Oman, Bahrain, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.

FT  06 JAN 94 / Peace talks close to compromise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation edged towards a compromise
formula for resuming peace talks yesterday but Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli
prime minister, ruled out a meeting this week.
Although both sides spoke optimistically of resuming talks next week, it is
unlikely the two sides can reach agreement on implementing Palestinian
self-rule in the Gaza strip and West Bank area of Jericho this month.
Fears for the peace accord rose this week as Mr Binyamin Netanyahu, leader
of the opposition right-wing Likud party, said he would not honour the
agreement if his party was elected to power because he considered the PLO to
have reneged on its commitments under the accord.
Mr Netanyahu's statement, which reversed an earlier commitment by Likud to
stand by the agreement, was intended to encourage opposition to the peace
accord and increase pressure on Mr Rabin to open a dialogue with Likud.
After an intense series of contacts by telephone and fax and a last minute
minor compromise by Jerusalem on the issue of borders, PLO and Israeli
officials said they were prepared to restart negotiations in the Egyptian
Red Sea resort of Taba next week.
However Mr Rabin said a final decision would only be taken today once Israel
was certain the PLO had accepted the rules and limits of negotiations.
Israeli officials said resumption of the talks was possible after the PLO
dropped several demands intended to increase the symbolic sovereignty of
Palestinian self-rule and after Israel agreed to meet one PLO demand for the
presence of Palestinian flags and policemen at the Jordanian-West Bank
border.

FT  06 JAN 94 / Israel hit by interest rate policy row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Israel's central bank and finance ministry were at loggerheads yesterday
over interest rate policy - a row that has become a public war of words.
The argument between Israel's two main economic policy-making bodies focuses
on interest rates and inflation and their impact on economic growth after
the Bank of Israel asserted its independence and raised interest rates
without consulting the ministry.
Mr Aharon Foegel, finance ministry director-general, accused the bank of
jeopardising economic growth and subverting the government's political
goals. The bank labelled the ministry's objections a 'policy of chatter
whose sole contribution is to shake economic stability'.
A central bank official said the bank had decided to raise interest rates to
commercial banks last week by 0.8 per cent from 9.7 to 10.5 per cent, to
curb rising inflation. Commercial banks followed suit, increasing the prime
lending rate from 11 to 11.8 per cent. According to preliminary estimates,
inflation last year was 11.5 per cent against the government's target of 10
per cent. The central bank felt this year's target of 8 per cent would be
unobtainable unless interest rates were increased.
'The greatest contribution the Bank of Israel can make now is by instilling
an environment of stability and sticking to the inflation target; we are in
a comfortable position to stick to our guns, because output has been growing
dramatically and there is no better environment to take another bite at
inflation,' Mr Jacob Frenkel, governor of the Bank of Israel, said
yesterday.
Mr Foegel said the central bank's move threatened the government growth
target of 6 per cent this year; higher interest rates would fuel
inflationary pressures and harm the economy's leading industrial growth
sectors. Last year's inflation rate was largely fuelled by house prices
which rose 20 per cent. The only way to curb inflation was to attack house
prices by measures to increase the supply of private land, low-cost housing
finance and tax incentives.
'We should create a monetary policy which suits the economic goals set by
the government ..the central bank must be co-ordinated with the government's
political goals and with those in charge of them,' Mr Foegel declared.
Mr Frenkel yesterday rejected Mr Foegel's criticisms. He said the bank had
exclusive control over monetary policy and it was an asset to 'maintain the
strongest independence of the central bank.'
Mr Gideon Schurr, central bank spokesman, said the central bank did not
fundamentally disagree with Mr Foegel's analysis of the reasons for high
inflation but until the government moved to lower housing prices, the Bank
of Israel would maintain its current interest rate policy. 'The finance
ministry is not acting quickly enough by giving or selling more land to the
market. Once we are back on target for an inflation rate of 8 per cent, of
course we will reduce interest rates again.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Senior Cambodian generals are preparing for an offensive against the Khmer
Rouge but concede their intention is a propaganda victory rather than a
military one.
At least 20 soldiers have been killed and 60 injured in sporadic clashes
between government and Khmer Rouge forces in western Cambodia since New
Year's Day, but it is not clear what strategic gains have been made by
either side.
Diplomats in Phnom Penh believe the government is eager to hold peace talks
with the Khmer Rouge but say the national army wants to show it is ready to
fight if necessary.
Progress towards talks between the two sides has been slow, held up at every
step by haggling over conditions. The Khmer Rouge has said it will only hold
talks with no pre-conditions. This has in turn become a serious stumbling
block because the government wants a clear commitment to a ceasefire before
it is willing to negotiate.
Informal contacts have taken place, notably on December 17 when the senior
prime minister, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, met the nominal leader of the
Khmer Rouge, Khieu Samphan. However, Prince Ranariddh and his officials have
since been eager to point out that these were 'just talks, not
negotiations'.
As if to prove the point, a week after the meeting, government forces
launched what senior generals have been calling a 'Christmas offensive'. So
far there has been no sign of large-scale fighting, only skirmishes.
This is the time of year when fighting has traditionally started in
Cambodia's long civil war with the beginning of the dry season.

FT  06 JAN 94 / N Korea relents on nuclear sites
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
North Korea has agreed in principle to a resumption of routine international
inspections of its nuclear facilities and to renewed talks with South Korea
on denuclearisation, a senior US official said.
Ms Lynn Davis, undersecretary of state for international security affairs,
said the agreement was very close to opening the way for further high-level
talks between North Korea and the US on additional inspections of suspected
nuclear waste sites that the Pyongyang government has blocked.
North Korea is now in talks in Vienna with the International Atomic Energy
Agency on the precise terms for resuming routine inspections of its nuclear
sites.
Ms Davis said she believed the IAEA and North Korea would be able to work
out these details 'in the coming few days'.
North Korea has demanded that the US suspend the annual Team Spirit joint
military exercise with South Korea in exchange for its agreement to resuming
inspections.
While Ms Davis said no decision had been taken on Team Spirit, she added
that 'we would look seriously at what the North has seen to be their
security concerns, and among those have been the Team Spirit exercises'.
The US has been increasingly concerned about possible North Korean efforts
to build nuclear weapons since Pyongyang threatened last March to withdraw
from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
The North Korean government then complained that the US had broken an
earlier agreement for IAEA inspections by resuming the Team Spirit exercise
in 1993, after a one-year suspension.
It also objected to demands for special inspections of two undeclared sites
suspected of holding nuclear wastes, which the IAEA wants to examine to
determine whether the North has been producing more weapons grade plutonium
than it has declared.
North Korea agreed to suspend its withdrawal from the NPT after two rounds
of talks with the US last summer, but it has continued to block routine IAEA
inspections over the Team Spirit issue.
US intelligence agencies disagree on whether the North has actually made a
nuclear weapon, but estimate that it has produced enough plutonium to build
one or two devices.

FT  06 JAN 94 / China proves a risk too good to resist: The attractions and
frustrations that banks find on the other side of the open door
</HEADLINE>

Angelina Fung lives in Shanghai in a five-star hotel which she says might as
well have 500 for all it can compensate for the apartment and lifestyle she
gave up in Hong Kong. The hotel offers only six-month corporate rates to
guests such as Ms Fung because inflation makes it impossible to set prices
over a longer period.
Vice-president of the foreign investment business sector division of
Citibank China, Ms Fung cannot look forward to early relief. But China,
where every day seems to bring new economic reforms and improved access to
foreigners, is the market every bank wants to win a share of.
Citibank underlined its commitment to the market last August, when it moved
its country headquarters - plus personnel - to Shanghai from Hong Kong. It
is just one of the international players forging a role for itself in China,
even though the big business - local yuan business - is still closed to
foreign banks. Overseas institutions can only deal with ventures which are
at least 25 per cent foreign-owned.
'Undoubtedly what we want is the renminbi (China's national currency)
business,' says Mr Anthony Russell, managing director of Hongkong Bank China
Services, 'and we have got one hand tied behind our back until that happens.
How quickly will we be allowed to build it up? That's the long-term
objective of the foreign banks.'
Instead, trade and project financing form much of the bread-and-butter work.
China, as an emerging country on a grand scale, has a full quota of property
and infrastructural development projects under way, many of them at an early
stage. These projects carry no security for their financiers - be it a
charge on the property underpinning the project or on cash flows - and banks
are forced to scrutinise the guarantors behind the project, usually a
Chinese bank or state-owned investment arm.
There is tentative talk of a national mortgage law, but at this stage laws
are either untried or at a rudimentary stage.
Credit analysis is further frustrated by the fact that disclosure of
information by companies to creditors is sketchy.
'Being banks we are in a risk-taking business, but we need to know what kind
of risk we are taking. This is one of the major problems,' says Ms Fung,
while Mr Russell dubs it 'much more hairy' than assessing more familiar
borrowers' credentials.
Mr Tony Nicolle, general manager for Hong Kong and China at Standard
Chartered Bank - Hong Kong's second note-issuing bank - says processing
trade finance paper on behalf of Chinese export companies dominates the
day-to-day work of the branch network in China, along with foreign lending.
The group will have 14 branch and representative offices by March.
On top of corporate banking, full service houses such as Citibank, Standard
Chartered and Hongkong Bank are able to tap into the securities market via
specially designated shares available to foreigners.
Overseas bankers reckon Beijing's long-awaited move last Saturday to unify
exchange rates by scrapping the official rate clears the way for the
authorities to grant overseas institutions the right to conduct yuan
business.
'The jungle drums suggest that some breakthrough will come this year,' says
Mr Russell. 'The People's Bank of China (the central bank) has been saying
for a while that there are two obstacles.
'One is the different rates of exchange - the official rate and the swap
centre rate. The other is the differential in taxation between foreign banks
and the domestic banks. The domestic banks complain of an unlevel playing
field because they pay twice as much tax.'
Mr Russell says the ministry of finance has introduced regulations that will
enable the domestic banks to have a similar tax structure. 'So these two big
problems are being removed.'
However, dismantling the fundamental obstacles still leaves a host of
technical issues. Not the least of these, from the Chinese authorities'
viewpoint, is how they will manage to retain control over money supply when
foreign entrants, operating on a different basis from the local banks which
can be held in check, enter the picture.
Yet to be decreed are how foreign banks can procure the yuan they lend and,
supposing they are allowed to receive yuan deposits, how they prepare for
alternative sources if deposits are withdrawn; what liquidity requirements
will look like; and what - if any - discount window facility will be
employed.
Banks with a strong presence across the border in Hong Kong see themselves
at an advantage to other international competitors. The colony plays a
pivotal role in dealings with mainland China, especially in terms of trade
and capital raising, and allows the bank to establish strong links with
overseas Chinese, who dominate direct investment and trade in China.
So far, with the exception of the Jardine group, which was singled out for a
harshly-worded verbal attack by Beijing, business has not been dragged into
the political conflict that is raging over the future of the colony and its
transitional arrangements for return to China in 1997.
'We are businessmen and have sought scrupulously to avoid being in political
difficulties that have arisen between Britain and China,' says Mr Nicolle.
'As a prominent bank in Hong Kong we are committed to promoting the
stability and prosperity of Hong Kong just as much as the British and
Chinese governments are and we hope we can go forward knowing it is in all
our interests not to get business and politics mixed up.'

FT  06 JAN 94 / Japanese car sales reach five-year low point
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japanese car sales hit a five-year low in 1993 but could show a weak
recovery at the end of this year, the Japan Automobile Dealers' Association
said yesterday.
Mr Yutaka Kume, chairman of Nissan, warned that demand was so weak that
producers would have to make 'strenuous efforts' to curb costs this year.
Japan's 11 motor groups recorded an 8.4 per cent fall in unit sales last
year, to 4.88m vehicles, the third consecutive year of decline, said the
association.
Nissan became the first Japanese carmaker since the war to close a factory
and discounting is becoming common as dealers attempt to attract cautious
customers.
Association officials believe sales could revive slightly, to more than 5m
this year, assuming that the government's economic packages and expected tax
cuts succeed in stimulating demand.
Mr Tatsuro Toyoda, chairman of Toyota, Japan's largest carmaker, recently
predicted that the Japanese market might expand to 5.1m units this year.
Among the top producers, Toyota's sales fell by 7.7 per cent, while Nissan
was down by 8.4 per cent, Mazda was worst hit with a 16.8 per cent decline,
and Honda's sales fell 14.9 per cent.
Exports fell for the eighth year running, partly due to the yen's strength,
but also as a result of the general shift of production out of Japan to
countries with lower production costs.
Nissan's Mr Kume predicted that exports would fall again this year, within
which there would be a steady rise in Japanese car sales to fast-growing
Asian markets.

FT  06 JAN 94 / Beirut rebuilding shares 'oversubscribed': Lebanon's biggest
stock offering aims to raise Dollars 650m from Arab investors
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Lebanon's biggest share launch - to establish Solidere, the company which
will rebuild war-torn central Beirut - will be oversubscribed, the company
and bankers handling the offering said yesterday.
The offer, designed to raise Dollars 650m towards the costs of rebuilding
Beirut, has been open to Lebanese and other Arab investors since November
and closes on January 10.
Mr Nasr al-Shamaa, secretary general of Solidere's founding board, said: 'We
will have a successful subscription, it will be oversubscribed.'
The offer represents 35 per cent of the founding capital of Solidere, which
is expected to begin putting out to tender the main contracts for the first
phase of central Beirut's reconstruction within weeks. The remaining capital
comprises shares granted to landowners in the Lebanese capital in exchange
for title to their property, which Solidere will develop.
Neither Solidere nor bankers handling the share offer will say how far the
offer is oversubscribed, though company officials have hinted that
subscriptions may reach Dollars 1bn. Bankers said they expected a late rush
for the Dollars 100 shares this week.
A successful offering would represent the largest injection of private, and
expatriate capital into the Lebanese government's ambitious reconstruction
schemes and would offer a substantial vote of confidence in the government
of Mr Rafik Hariri, the country's businessman-turned-prime minister.
However, the offer is not unanimously popular, and Sheikh Mohammed Hussein
Fadlallah, spiritual leader of the pro-Iranian Hizbollah, last week decreed
a ban on the purchase of Solidere shares. He said property owners in central
Beirut had been compelled to give up their flats, shops and houses, an act
which he said Islam considered a sin.
Final allocations of the shares will not be known for up to 10 days after
the offer closes. Priority will be given to Lebanese property owners in
Beirut, Lebanese nationals living in the country, government agencies,
Lebanese expatriates and, finally, Arabs elsewhere. Paribas, in London, and
Saudi American Bank, in Riyadh, have both reported healthy demand for
placements with Gulf Arabs and Lebanese expatriates.
Non-Lebanese institutions are not allowed to buy shares and no individual
holding can exceed 10 per cent. Al-Anwar, the Lebanese newspaper, reported
on Tuesday that Mr Hariri had subscribed for the maximum permissible stake.
A secondary market in Solidere shares is expected to open by February,
forming a basis upon which the government hopes to rebuild Beirut's bourse.
Stock market officials believe a skeletal stock market could be operating
within eight months. The original market was closed in 1983, during
Lebanon's 17-year civil war.

FT  06 JAN 94 / Cambodian offensive planned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PHNOM PENH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Senior Cambodian generals say they are preparing their forces for an
offensive against the Khmer Rouge but they concede their intention is a
propaganda victory rather than a military one.
At least 20 soldiers have been killed and 60 injured in sporadic clashes
between government and Khmer Rouge forces in western Cambodia since New
Year's Day, but it is not clear what strategic gains, if any, have been made
by either side.
Diplomats in Phnom Penh believe the government is eager to hold peace talks
with the Khmer Rouge but say the national army wants to show it is ready to
fight if necessary.
Progress towards talks between the two sides has been painfully slow, held
up at every step by haggling over conditions. The Khmer Rouge has said it
will only hold talks with no pre-conditions. This has in turn become a
serious stumbling block because the government wants to see a clear
commitment to a ceasefire before it is willing to negotiate.
Informal contacts have already taken place, notably on December 17 when the
senior prime minister, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, met the nominal leader of
the Khmer Rouge, Khieu Samphan. However, Prince Ranariddh and his officials
have since been eager to point out that these were 'just talks, not
negotiations'.
As if to prove the point, a week after the meeting, government forces
launched what senior generals have been calling a 'Christmas offensive'. So
far there has been no sign of large-scale fighting, only skirmishes.
This is the time of year when fighting has traditionally started in
Cambodia's long civil war. The beginning of the dry season brings relief for
both sides from the muddy roads and impassable terrain of the monsoon rains.
The government side, which has a collection of ancient tanks and armoured
personnel carriers, is able to use them, as well as moving its heavy
artillery into position.
According to one general in western Cambodia, the order to launch the
Christmas offensive was accompanied by a warning that this was designed to
'put pressure on the DK (Khmer Rouge) for talks, not to ensure a military
victory'. In any case, he said, the government side was so short of arms and
ammunition it could not sustain a big offensive for more than a few days at
a time.

Mr Chris Patten, governor of Hong Kong, is likely to introduce the more
controversial elements of his democracy reform proposals to the Legislative
Council in March, according to the government radio, Louise Lucas reports.
Beijing has already reacted strongly to the tabling of the so-called
non-controversial elements, which include lowering the voting age to 18 from
21, and says it will dismantle all elected bodies upon regaining
sovereignty.

The United Nations tried to evacuate most of its staff from the northern
Afghanistan city of Mazar-i-Sharif yesterday, as looters robbed its
storehouses and offices amid worsening fighting, Steve LeVine reports from
Tashkent.
The fighting imperilled 18,000 refugees from the ex-Soviet republic of
Tajikistan, living in a UN camp near Mazar-i-Sharif.
In the most widespread fighting in Afghanistan since the Moscow-backed
government fell in April 1992 the violence in Mazar-i-Sharif was an
extension of heated battles going on in the capital, Kabul. The fighting has
been the worst threat faced by the Afghan president, Mr Berhanuddin Rabbani,
a Tajik, in more than a year of rocket attacks on Kabul by ethnic rivals.

Police yesterday fired on supporters of Pakistan prime minister Ms Benazir
Bhutto's jailed brother who were demonstrating outside her family home in
the city of Larkana, writes Farhan Bokhari in Islamabad.
One man died and seven were injured.
The incident was the worst in the family tussle between Ms Bhutto and her
estranged brother, Murtaza, who is in prison on charges of sponsoring
anti-government terrorism during his 16 years of exile.
Mrs Nusrat Bhutto, their mother, was among the demonstrators when riot
police armed with teargas and assault rifles, opened fire to stop the
activists reaching the grave of her husband, Mr Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the
former prime minister hanged in 1979. Mr Murtaza Bhutto's supporters had
vowed to stop Ms Benazir Bhutto from reaching the site and offering prayers,
because they consider her brother to be the true heir to the family's
legacy.

FT  06 JAN 94 / US calls on Japan to lift economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US yesterday renewed its call for the Japanese government to stimulate
the country's economy, and warned it not to hope for a weaker yen to pull it
out of recession.
Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US treasury secretary, said Japan still had a huge
trade surplus, and could not look to the US and other countries to make up
for slack domestic demand.
'Allowing the yen to slide is not an acceptable way out of recession for
Japan,' Mr Bentsen said in a speech yesterday at the Brookings Institution,
a Washington think-tank.
Although foreign exchange traders had been waiting for Mr Bentsen's speech,
the yen strengthened only modestly on his remarks.
Mr Bentsen said he wanted to see economic policies that would stimulate
demand in Japan and help Japanese consumers. 'I think if they do that the
yen will reflect it,' he added.
Presenting an overview of the Clinton administration's economic policies, Mr
Bentsen expressed confidence that the steps already taken to reduce the US
federal budget deficit would bring more economic good news in 1994.
Growth had accelerated steadily throughout 1993, and in the fourth quarter
should reach between 4 and 5 per cent, he said, while the inflation rate of
2.8 per cent was as low as it had been for years.
'This year I'd like to see us achieve a solid 3 per cent real growth - and
hold inflation to approximately 3 per cent. That should allow interest rates
to remain relatively low and reduce further the unemployment rate,' Mr
Bentsen said.
Noting that, like millions of US homeowners, he had refinanced his own
mortgage last year to take advantage of lower interest rates, Mr Bentsen
said he had selected an adjustable rate mortgage, 'which means I'm
optimistic about what's going to happen to interest rates.'
Although he said the budget deficit for the 1995 fiscal year, starting
October 1, would be only about Dollars 190bn, much lower than the
administration had earlier forecast, Mr Bentsen warned that the budget would
be very tight.
Nine out of 14 cabinet departments would see a cut in their budgets, due to
be announced on February 7, if favoured programmes categorised as investment
are excluded.
Further evidence of the strength of the US economy in the fourth quarter of
1993 came yesterday when the commerce department announced new orders for
manufactured goods rose by 1.4 per cent in November, the fourth consecutive
month of rising orders.

FT  06 JAN 94 / Sales of new cars and trucks in US rise 8%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DETROIT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sales of new cars and light trucks in the US rose more than 8 per cent last
year to about 14.2m, the highest level since 1989, provisional industry
figures show. Sales rose by 1.1m from 13.1m in 1992 and 12.5m in 1991, the
low point of the last recession. The US market peaked at 16.3m in 1986.
The strengthening recovery in the US new vehicle market is in stark contrast
to the steep fall in demand in Europe last year and the further drop in new
vehicle sales in Japan, where demand has fallen for three years in
succession.
The increase in sales in the US has been driven by the surge in demand for
light trucks, such as pick-ups, mini-vans (multi-purpose vehicles), vans and
four-wheel-drive sports/utility vehicles, now accounting for about 40 per
cent of the US passenger vehicle market.
Light truck sales, still dominated by the big three US vehicle makers,
General Motors, Ford and Chrysler, rose 16 per cent last year to a record
5.7m; car sales rose 4 per cent to 8.5m.
US carmakers outperformed the market with a 10.4 per cent increase in new
vehicle sales. Japanese carmakers have been forced to increase prices faster
than their US rivals. Under pressure from the strong appreciation in the
value of the yen, the Japanese have lost market share.
The rapid improvement in the fortunes of the domestic US vehicle makers was
led by Chrysler, smallest of the big three, which increased its total
vehicle sales 19.9 per cent to 2.047m from 1.71m a year earlier.
Sales of light trucks by Chrysler accounted for 59 per cent of its total
sales volume last year. The company is strengthening its position with the
launch of a series of new cars this year, including the Neon small car and
the Chrysler Cirrus/Dodge Stratus large family cars, unveiled this week at
the Detroit motor show.
Chrysler, which is undertaking a rapid renewal of its product range,
increased its car sales last year by 23.1 per cent to 834,132; its light
truck sales rose 17.8 per cent to 1.2m.
Ford also performed strongly and accounted for five of the top 10
best-selling vehicles in the US. Its full-sized F-series pick-up was the
best-selling vehicle at 565,000, while the Ford Taurus was the best-selling
car at 360,000, ahead of the Honda Accord at 330,000. Ford's total vehicle
sales rose 12 per cent to 3.6m; its car sales increased by 6 per cent to
1.878m, while light truck sales rose 19.4 per cent to 1.68m.
General Motors, the world's biggest vehicle maker, suffered another small
erosion of its US market share to about 33 per cent. Its total vehicle sales
rose 5.9 per cent to 4.7m. GM increased its new car sales 2 per cent to
2.93m; its truck sales rose 13 per cent to 1.79m.
Honda's sales in the US fell 7.3 per cent last year to 717,000. Total
vehicle sales by Toyota, including its Lexus luxury car division, increased
1.3 per cent to 1.033m. Sales of cars under the Toyota brand fell 2.1 per
cent. Nissan, the second biggest Japanese car maker, recovered after falling
behind its Japanese rivals in the US. Its total sales, including the
Infiniti luxury car division, rose 17.9 per cent to 680,000.

FT  06 JAN 94 / Back to the future for VW
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Volkswagen, the German carmaker, yesterday unveiled the concept car for a
modern-day Beetle at the Detroit motor show as part of its effort to arrest
its sharply declining fortunes in the US market.
The Beetle, the world's best-selling car, with output totalling more than
71m, is still produced in Mexico and Brazil. It was first sold in the US in
1949.
VW is seeking to gauge market reaction, in particular in the US, to its
'back to the future' Beetle concept, and any decision to go into eventual
production would be unlikely before the mid-1990s.
At the height of its success in the US at the end of the 1960s, VW was
selling more than 500,000 cars a year, virtually all Beetles. It was the
leading car importer in the US, before the Japanese car industry began its
assault in the 1970s and 1980s, but in 1993 sales of VW cars fell to a new
low point of only 49,533.
The VW Concept 1, has been designed by Volkswagen's Californian design
studio opened in 1991.
The body shape is derived from the rounded old Beetle design, but
mechanically it would be a modern car. The German carmaker said the Concept
1 structure was based on a chassis platform of its new generation Polo small
car.

FT  06 JAN 94 / Mexican rebellion starts to fade: Strife-torn Chiapas state
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Mexican army tightened its control over former rebel strongholds in the
southern state of Chiapas yesterday as questions were raised over its
excessive use of force.
Government aircraft fired rockets and cannon early yesterday over the
village of Ranche Grande, outside the city of San Cristobal, even though
peasants said the Zapatista Army of National Liberation had long since
withdrawn.
The rockets, which nearly hit a television crew covering the uprising,
followed similar attacks late on Tuesday.
The government said rebel troops were still in the area and an army
helicopter had been damaged by rebel fire. The ministry of defence said 61
rebels had died, bringing the official death toll to 95.
In Ococingo, a town rebels had captured on New Year's Day and which was
seized back by the army by Tuesday, at least15 insurgents lay dead in the
market and in the main roads. At least seven appeared to have been shot at
close range in the back of the head. Some had string tied to their wrists,
suggesting they may have been tied up first.
Mr Eloy Cantu, the government spokesman in San Cristobal, said the federal
government was willing to open a dialogue with the rebels, if they
immediately ceased hostilities, handed in their weapons, and identified
their leaders. There was no sign that rebels, who seem to have withdrawn to
the jungle or towns where they live, would meet the demands.
Msgr Samuel Ruiz, the bishop of San Cristobal, has called for international
human rights observers to monitor the situation in Chiapas. With the formal
insurrection almost at an end, observers are concerned the army might abuse
human rights while searching for rebels in towns and jungle. President
Carlos Salinas asked the head of the government's human rights commission to
monitor developments.
In Ococingo residents were leaving their homes for the first time since New
Year's Day and tension had died down. Government officials said life was
returning to normal in other towns briefly under rebel control. However
there were still places where fighting was continuing, they said.
The rebels had destroyed several buildings in Ococingo, including the
municipal palace. They had kidnapped a farmer and his family, and at least
one member was still reported missing, according to a builder outside the
house. The residents interviewed showed little sympathy for the rebels, and
were concerned about the economic cost of the uprising.
While most of the rebels seem to have fled populated areas, several were
seen walking between San Cristobal and Ococingo, having lost contact with
their group.
Mostly in their teens, and all apparently indigenous people, they had little
sense of why they were fighting, or what it would achieve. They seemed more
motivated by the despair and poverty in which they live.
One rebel peasant, aged 17, said he fought 'because we have nothing -
nothing to eat.' Another said 'it is because of our poverty, for many
things, I don't know, for the necessity.' The first professed never to have
heard of the North American Free Trade Agreement, one of the ostensible
grievances.
Mr Cantu said a group of extremists were manipulating the population, and
that among them were Guatemalans and El Salvadoreans.

FT  06 JAN 94 / Sales of new cars and trucks in US rise 8%: Recovery
contrasts with further fall in Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Sales of new cars and light trucks in the US rose by more than 8 per cent
last year to around 14.2m, the highest level since 1989, according to
provisional industry figures.
Sales rose by 1.1m from 13.1m in 1992 and 12.5m in 1991, the low point of
the last recession. The US market peaked at 16.3m in 1986.
The strengthening recovery in the US new vehicle market is in stark contrast
to the steep fall in demand in Europe last year and the further drop in new
vehicle sales in Japan, where demand has fallen for three years in
succession.
The increase in sales in the US has been driven by the surge in demand for
light trucks, such as pick-ups, mini-vans (multi-purpose vehicles), vans and
four-wheel drive sports/utility vehicles, now accounting for about 40 per
cent of the US passenger vehicle market.
Light truck sales, still dominated by the big three US vehicle makers,
General Motors, Ford and Chrysler, rose 16 per cent last year to a record
5.7m; car sales rose 4 per cent to 8.5m.
US carmakers outperformed the market with a 10.4 per cent increase in new
vehicle sales. Japanese carmakers have been forced to increase prices faster
than their US rivals.
Under pressure from the strong appreciation in the value of the yen, the
Japanese have lost market share.
The rapid improvement in the fortunes of the domestic US vehicle makers was
led by Chrysler, the smallest of the big three, which increased its total
vehicle sales 19.9 per cent to 2.047m from 1.71m a year earlier.
Sales of light trucks by Chrysler accounted for 59 per cent of its total
sales volume last year but the company is strengthening its position in the
car market with the launch of a series of new cars this year, including the
Neon small car and the Chrysler Cirrus/Dodge Stratus large family cars,
which were unveiled this week at the Detroit motor show.
Chrysler, which is undertaking a rapid renewal of its product range,
increased its car sales last year by 23.1 per cent to 834,132, while its
light truck sales rose 17.8 per cent to 1.2m.
Ford also performed strongly and accounted for five of the top 10
best-selling vehicles in the US. Its full-sized F-series pick-up was the
best-selling vehicle in the US at 565,000, while the Ford Taurus was the
best-selling car at 360,000, ahead of the Honda Accord at 330,000.
Ford's total vehicle sales increased 12 per cent to 3.6m. Its car sales
increased by 6 per cent to 1.878m, while light truck sales rose by 19.4 per
cent to 1.68m.
General Motors, the world's biggest vehicle maker, suffered a further small
erosion of its US market share to about 33 per cent. Its total vehicle sales
rose 5.9 per cent to 4.7m.
GM, whose North American automotive operations are being drastically
restructured after several years of heavy losses, increased its new car
sales by 2 per cent to 2.93m, while its truck sales increased 13 per cent to
1.79m.
Among the Japanese car makers, Honda's sales in the US fell 7.3 per cent
last year to 717,000. Total vehicle sales by Toyota, including its Lexus
luxury car division, increased 1.3 per cent to 1.033m. Sales of cars under
the Toyota brand fell 2.1 per cent.
Nissan, the second biggest Japanese car maker, staged a strong recovery
after falling behind its Japanese rivals in the US, and its total sales,
including the Infiniti luxury car division, rose 17.9 per cent to 680,000.

<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton will not meet President Leonid Kravchuk of Ukraine
during his visit to Moscow next week unless significant progress has been
made on US demands that Ukraine live up to its promises to give up the
nuclear weapons based on its territory.
Talks between the US, Russia and Ukraine on the nuclear missile issue have
accelerated in recent days, but White House and State Department officials
have been much
more cautious about the prospects for reaching agreement than their
Ukrainian counterparts.
In Kiev, Mr Kravchuk is said to have already been invited to Moscow by Mr
Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president.
US officials meeting this week in Washington with Mr Valery Shmarov, the
Ukrainian deputy foreign minister, insisted a deal of such importance could
not be rushed through just to fit in with the Moscow summit.
Senator Richard Lugar, who is currently visiting Moscow, said yesterday: 'My
understanding is the meeting will occur if President Kravchuk is prepared to
sign the non-proliferation treaty on behalf of Ukraine; likewise, the pledge
that all the SS-19 and SS-24 missiles will, in fact, be dismantled and the
warheads shipped back for destruction in Russia.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
France is to start sending its defence minister and chief-of-staff to Nato
meetings which have a bearing 'on the possible use of French forces or on
French interests', a senior defence official said in Paris yesterday.
This move will effectively put an end to France's boycott of Nato defence
ministers' meetings ever since the late President de Gaulle ordered Nato
headquarters out of Paris in 1966 and removed French troops from the
alliance's integrated military command.
'The French government has decided that its defence minister and
chief-of-staff can attend Nato meetings which discuss the possible use of
French forces, such as in ex-Yugoslavia or in central and eastern Europe, or
in operations involving the Western European Union,' which by the Maastricht
treaty is the intended defence arm of the European Union, according to the
official.
He predicted that French defence ministers would thus figure 'relatively
frequently' at Brussels meetings, though not necessarily at each of the
biannual meetings of the alliance's defence planning committee. France would
also like to see foreign and defence ministers of Nato countries meeting
together as they do in the WEU.
President Boris Yeltsin yesterday issued a sharp protest against Lithuania's
wish to join Nato, warning this could rekindle cold war divisions and lead
to the region's 'military and political destabilisation', writes Leyla
Boulton in Moscow.
In a statement published a day after the former Soviet republic announced it
had applied to join Nato, Mr Yeltsin's spokesman said that the president was
concerned that the expansion of Nato to include countries on Russia's border
would provoke 'a negative reaction' in Russia.
The spokesman, Mr Vyacheslav Kostikov, said the Russian president expected
Nato leaders to dispel 'an impression of ambiguity on a question which
concerns both the fate of the world and of Russia's national interests'.

<TEXT>
The US ambassador to the United Nations, Mrs Madeleine Albright, warned
Croatia yesterday that it could face international economic sanctions unless
it stayed out of the Bosnian war.
The warning, issued during a news conference in Zagreb, the Croat capital,
came as Moslem and Croatian negotiators in Vienna promised to make 'firm
efforts' to stop the war in central Bosnia at a top-level meeting in Bonn on
Saturday.
Mrs Albright said the US was 'very concerned' by the reported activities of
the Croatian military in support of Bosnian Croat forces. 'We have in a
number of ways warned the Croatian government and military specifically on
the subject,' she said.
Her words came hard on the heels of statements by President Franjo Tudjman
and his senior officials that Zagreb might intervene directly to support
Bosnian Croat forces encircled by Moslem-led Bosnian troops in the central
Lasva valley.
In spite of government denials, UN officers and Lord Owen, the European
Union's mediator on Yugoslavia, have claimed that Croatia has already given
military help against both Moslems and Serbs.
It was announced yesterday that Lieutenant-General Sir Michael Rose of
Britain would become the new commander of UN forces in Bosnia. General Rose,
currently commander of UK Land Forces, succeeds Belgium's Lt-Gen Francis
Briquemont, who has asked to be relieved at the end of this month.

Confusion surrounded the fate last night of Mr Zviad Gamsakhurdia, the
ousted president of Georgia.
According to the Itar Tass official news agency, he committed suicide on
December 31. However, Mr Gamsakhurdia's Moscow spokesman said he had seen
him alive on Saturday, a day after his reported death. But he could not say
whether he was still alive.
Quoting the former president's wife, Manana, Itar Tass said earlier in the
day that he had taken his own life after being surrounded at night by
'unknown men' in an area in western Georgia following the collapse last
October of his attempt to retake power from Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, the
current Georgian head of state.
However, the Georgian security ministry said that its intelligence sources
believed he had been shot in Grozny, the capital of the Russian republic of
Chechnya, where he had taken refuge since his violent overthrow in January
1992.

FT  06 JAN 94 / Defenders of the franc
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING and ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The nine-member council which was yesterday entrusted with the management of
France's monetary policy brings together an assortment of individuals from
the worlds of politics and business to academia and journalism.
Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, the governor of the central bank, and his two
deputies, Mr Herve Hannoun and Mr Denis Ferman, will be joined by six
members who span political and occupational lines.
The best-known of the council members is Mr Michel Albert, 63, who for the
past 10 years has been chairman of Assurances Generales de France (AGF), the
third largest French insurance group. Mr Albert is as renowned for his
writing on economic issues as for his work in the insurance industry.
His 1991 book, Capitalisme Contre Capitalisme, which analysed the structural
differences between the French, German and Anglo-Saxon models of capitalism,
has been highly influential in France.
Mr Albert, a devout Europhile, has long been committed to the Balladur
government's policy of maintaining a strong franc. Those views are shared by
the left's representative on the council, Mr Michel Sapin, finance minister
in the former Socialist government. Mr Sapin, who at 41 is the youngest
member of the committee, demonstrated his commitment to a strong franc
during his 11-month tenure as finance minister.
His appointment was the subject of a dispute between the Socialist
president, Mr Francois Mitterrand, and Mr Balladur. The prime minister,
concerned about the appointment of a politician close to Mr Michel Rocard,
the Socialist leader, finally agreed to the appointment on Tuesday night.
Also contested was the appointment of Mrs Denise Flouzat, an economics
professor, who has worked at several universities including the Sorbonne in
Paris. She fought off a challenge for the final place on the committee from
Mr Alexis Gourvennec, head of Brittany Ferries.
In laying out his plans for an independent Bank of France last summer, Mr
Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister, said he did not want the monetary
policy council to be dominated by the 'Parisian monetary intelligentsia'.
But Mrs Flouzat, who is 65 and the only woman on the council, ensures that
there will be one representative of this group.
The voice of industry is expected to come from Mr Jean-Pierre Gerard, head
of France's national standards testing laboratories. An engineer, Mr Gerard
was chairman of Thomson Jeumont, the cables group, in 1980-1984.
Mr Balladur can expect support for the franc fort from Mr Jean Boissonat,
the media's representative on the council. Mr Boissonat, 65, an economics
commentator, has long advocated monetary stability.
The ninth member of the council is another financial heavyweight, Mr Bruno
de Maulde, 59, chairman of the Conseil des Bourses de Valeurs, the stock
market watchdog, and a former chairman of Credit du Nord, a retail banking
subsidiary of the Paribas group.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
West Germany's unemployment rate in December rose to its highest level since
reunification four years ago, overshooting government estimates and damping
hopes for economic recovery in 1994.
More than 2.5m were registered without jobs in the western part of the
country in December, bringing the unadjusted unemployment rate to 8.1 per
cent, according to figures released by the Federal Labour Office yesterday.
This compares with 2.4m in November and an unemployment rate of 7.8 per
cent.
The high unemployment rate was announced as industrial orders for November
continued to show weak domestic demand. Orders in Germany fell by 0.5 per
cent against October, while orders from abroad dropped by 1.5 per cent,
according to the economics ministry.
In light of the continuing recession, Mr Hans-Jurgen Koebnik, a member of
the Bundesbank decision-making central council, said yesterday that the
central bank's policymakers believed Germany's short-term interest rates
were too high.
The 5.75 per cent discount rate and the 6.75 per cent Lombard rate,
unchanged since October 22, would fall during the course of the year
provided conditions were right, he said. Mr Koebnik, president of the
central bank of Saarland and Rhineland-Palatinate, said the inflation rate
was an especially important factor.
His remarks match the opinions of most independent economists, but contrast
with the approach traditional among Germany's central bankers.
Mr Bernhard Jagoda, president of the federal labour office, said the
unemployment figures were 'largely attributable to seasonal fluctuations'.
Still, on an adjusted basis the number of unemployed west Germans rose to
2.494m in December from 2.489m in November. In total, 675,000 people lost
jobs in western Germany for the whole year.
In the autumn, a government forecast said the west German jobless rate would
reach 7.5 per cent by the end of 1993. But unemployment is expected to climb
to 10 per cent next year, according to revised government projections.

The Russian government, strapped for cash and awash with property, is to
spend Dollars 500m on a new parliament after taking over the old one for
itself.
Mr Pavel Borodin, a senior official in President Boris Yeltsin's
administration, told the organising committee for the new parliament that
construction would begin next month and take 10 months. Contracts would be
awarded this month to foreign companies to erect the complex, complete with
a 700-room hotel for deputies.
The government has taken over the old parliament building with Mr Victor
Chernomyrdin, prime minister, already occupying the office of the jailed
parliamentary speaker, Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov.
The authorities have been unable to clear adequate space for the new federal
assembly. Its lower chamber is to be housed temporarily in the former
Comecon skyscraper, while the upper chamber is to sit in the former Soviet
construction ministry.

FT  06 JAN 94 / Ten years of know-how won at stroke: VW-GM court case claim
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
By poaching eight General Motors employees last year, Volkswagen gained
access 'overnight' to a fund of business know-how built up by the US group
over almost 10 years, a Frankfurt court was told yesterday.
If VW had succeeded with its scheme to lure away a further 21 purchasing and
production experts, the result would have been a 'catastrophe' for General
Motors Europe, according to Mr Heinz Wetterkamp, a lawyer representing Adam
Opel, GM's German subsidiary.
Mr Wetterkamp was pleading in the first open-court confrontation between the
rival motor groups since VW's controversial hiring of Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez
de Arriortua, GM's former global purchasing chief, last March.
Opel has claimed VW set out systematically, and in breach of competition
rules, to woo away key GM personnel, and demanded that the seven men who
followed Mr Lopez almost immediately should be suspended from their jobs for
a year.
Mr Jurgen Kicker, VW's lawyer, countered that seven defectors had followed
Mr Lopez of their own free will. The charismatic Basque's 'warriors' had
left the US group because 'people feel helpless and isolated' when their
chief goes, he suggested.
Mr Kicker, who claimed GM had employed psychological pressure to try to
prevent Mr Lopez and at least one of his colleagues from going, said
penalties such as suspension from work could only apply in cases of 'massive
poaching'. Mr Wetterkamp was basing his case on seven people, he said.
However, files before the court contain affidavits from a further 20 Opel
employees who claim to have been approached by Mr Lopez and others. Some
were allegedly offered doubled salaries.
Although yesterday's civil suit is formally unconnected with a continuing
criminal investigation into allegations of document theft and industrial
espionage against Mr Lopez and three of the seven, Mr Wetterkamp wove
details from the two cases together in an apparent bid to persuade the court
that the defections had been carefully plotted.
Mr Lopez had arrived in Germany on March 16. A special aircraft almost
immediately brought in 20 boxes of documents which had earlier been sent to
Spain at Mr Lopez's request. Within days, when his followers started to
arrive, a 'task force' had been set up to file data in computers, GM
documents from the boxes were shredded in VW's private company guesthouse,
and all seven men were promptly installed in new jobs.
'Preparations were so far advanced that they could take jobs immediately,'
Mr Wetterkamp said.
Although Opel had failed in two previous attempts to win temporary
injunctions to have the seven men suspended, company officials said after
the hearing that they were confident of winning this time. The court is to
rule on February 2. It was the first time the full evidence had been taken
into consideration, and the judge had refused VW's appeals that he should
'take the easy route' and dismiss the case on procedural grounds, a
spokesman noted.

The monetary policy committee (MPC) is the only part of the Bank of France
which will now be independent of overt government control.
The government will retain a say in the remaining Bank of France activities,
which include supervising commercial banks, compiling corporate data,
running the payments clearing system, providing management advice to
industry, and conducting some private banking.
The government decided to leave the central bank's structure intact, but to
create within it the MPC as a sanctuary against political influence on
monetary policy, money supply, interest rates and the consequences of these
for the external and internal value of the franc.
The MPC's nine members - the six outside directors appointed yesterday and
the the bank's governor, Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, and his two deputy
governors - are forbidden to 'solicit or accept' external instruction on the
conduct of monetary policy. But as Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy
minister, said yesterday: 'The bridges with the (economy) ministry are not
cut. Concertation and discussion (with the government) will obviously be
maintained as in the US or Germany.'
The issue of accountability remains unclear. The MPC, which will hold its
first meeting next week, is different from both Bundesbank and Federal
Reserve. It must decide the degree to which its president should follow the
Fed example of appearing regularly before parliament, or the Bundesbank
example of press conferences, or combining both.

The French government yesterday completed the final stage of its creation of
an independent central bank, appointing a nine-member council which will
have autonomy in the conduct of monetary policy and the determination of
interest rates.
Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister, described the establishment of
the Bank of France's monetary policy council as 'an historic step'. He said
the central bank would be as independent as the Bundesbank in the
formulation of monetary policy.
The reform, according to Mr Alphandery, should strengthen the credibility of
anti-inflationary policies and brings France into line with the requirements
of the Maastricht treaty on European Union. Under the treaty, member
countries must establish independent monetary authorities as part of the
second phase of monetary union.
The nine-member council will be headed by Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, the
governor of the Bank of France and his two deputies, Mr Herve Hannoun and Mr
Denis Ferman. The six lay members, described by Mr Alphandery as 'respected
and representative' are drawn from a range of occupations from journalism to
industry. They include Mr Michel Albert, chairman of Assurances Generales de
France (AGF), the state-owned insurance group, and Mr Michel Sapin, the
former Socialist finance minister. The six lay members have nine-year terms,
while the Bank of France officials have six year terms. Economists and
bankers in Paris said they did not expect any substantial changes in the
conduct of monetary policy.
'Mr Trichet and other influential members of the council support the present
policy of gradually reducing interest rates, while maintaining the stability
of the currency,' said one currency analyst. The newly-independent central
bank does, however, have some room to ease borrowing costs. The return of
the French franc to the narrow European exchange rate bands, from which it
was forced following last summer's currency crisis, could allow a reduction
in the intervention rate, the floor for money market rates, from its current
level of 6.2 per cent.

FT  06 JAN 94 / Italians choke on drugs regime
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Seldom have drugs companies, doctors, pharmacists and patients been so
united against legislation as they are in Italy since new rules on selling
drugs came into effect on January 1.
Queues have built up outside pharmacies, doctors' surgeries and hospital
emergency units from Parma to Palermo as patients struggle to grasp the
impact of complex new laws designed to cut rising health costs and crack
down on unauthorised drug sales.
Foreign pharmaceutical companies have adopted a cautious response to rule
changes which put their products into three categories: A for free drugs; B
for those receiving a 50 per cent government subsidy; and C for drugs where
the patient pays the full cost.
They say they have yet to study the regulations and point out that there is
a 30-day period in which they can appeal against decisions to take drugs off
the free list.
There is much at stake for the industry. The Italian market is the third
biggest in the Europe and sales there last year were worth about 6 per cent
of the Dollars 200bn (Pounds 135.1bn) annual global prescription drug
market.
Sanofi-Winthrop, a US-French joint venture, is typical of many. Its sales of
Dollars 190m a year in Italy could be cut sharply. Several of its drugs,
including the big selling anti-clotting agent, Tiklit, have been consigned
to category B.
Even worse hit could be Ares-Serono, a Swiss company whose Italian sales
have already fallen by a quarter in Swiss franc terms in the past 12 months
thanks to drug price controls and devaluation of the lira.
The company said yesterday it expected sales to continue to fall. Its cancer
treatment, TPI, with sales worth Dollars 80m a year, has been put into
category C.
Opponents of the classifications should be cheered by the apparent anomalies
that have arisen. Glaxo of the UK, for example, makes two asthma drugs. The
old one, Ventolin is in category A, and the new one, Serevent, is in C. The
result is likely to be that Italian asthma sufferers will use the older
treatment.
Leading Italian drug companies, some of which say they will lose billions of
lire in annual sales as a result of the reclassification, have threatened to
take legal action against the health ministry on the grounds of inadequate
consultation.
However, Mr Cesare Fassari, a spokesman for the Italian pharmaceutical
industry association, has emphasised that his members back the government's
decision to update the previous list of free medicines and liberalise drugs
pricing.
Strict price supervision and the lengthy bureaucratic steps required to get
products on to the old list were partly responsible for the system of
kickbacks and other abuses by drugs companies which have come to light in
recent months in Italy's long-running political corruption scandal.
The industry, however, argues that the new classifications are likely to
need considerable revision within the next 60 days, when a new price
structure designed to bring Italian drugs prices into line those elsewhere
in Europe, comes into effect.
Senior government officials recognised yesterday that the new rules would
have to be altered to make them more transparent and potentially to soften
the blow for pharmaceutical companies.
