FT  25 MAR 94 / Ulster committee debate allowed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government has allowed time for another Commons debate on the proposed
Northern Ireland select committee, signalling its determination to get the
new body up and running soon after Easter.
Next Tuesday's debate is needed because the planned composition of the
committee - widely seen as a reinforcement of the government's commitment to
Ulster's unionist majority - remains a bone of party political contention.
Labour objects to Tory proposals forced through the Commons selection
committee earlier this week which will limit its membership of the new body
to two MPs.
This compares with six Conservatives, four unionists and one member of the
mainly Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party. Opposition MPs are
expected to force several votes on Tuesday in a move to secure a more
favourable alignment of forces.
Meanwhile, Mr John Hume, the SDLP leader, yesterday urged republicans to
summon 'enormous courage' to abandon support for violence and engage in the
democratic effort to bring peace to the province.
He called on the IRA to lay down its guns and for Sinn Fein to enter the
talks process.
He said Ireland was at a crucial point in its history and that a search for
peace which included Dublin, Sinn Fein, nationalists and the Irish overseas
 -particularly those in the US - offered no threat to unionists.
If proposals are allowed to stand, select committee members will include Sir
James Kilfedder, the Ulster Popular Unionist MP for North Down and front
runner for chairman, and Mr Andrew Hunter, the pro-unionist chairman of the
Conservative backbench Northern Ireland committee.
Other committee members would be Conservatives Mr James Cran, Mr Charles
Hendry, Mr Richard Spring, Mr David Wilshire and Mr Mark Wolfson; Labour's
Mr Jim Marshall and Mr Clive Soley Mr Eddie McGrady (SDLP), Mr Ken Maginnis
and Mr John Taylor (UUP), and Mr Peter Robinson (DUP).
Today's planned visit to Northern Ireland by Mrs Mary Robinson, the Irish
president, drew attacks yesterday from unionist politicians, who described
the decision as provocative and an insult to the Queen.

FT  25 MAR 94 / Mobile phones market surges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cellnet, the second-largest mobile phone operator, has passed the million
subscriber mark with net new connections growing at twice the rate of a year
ago.
Vodafone - the largest operator, with more than 1.1m subscribers - is
reporting similar growth. Last month it had 58,000 gross new connections.
After record growth in the run-up to Christmas, Cellnet had expected a sharp
slow-down in new connections but it is projecting a gross 70,000 new
subscribers for this month, only a small decline from 84,000 in December.
By the end of this month Cellnet, a joint venture between British
Telecommunications and Securicor, will have added a net 110,000 subscribers
to its network since the beginning of January compared with 56,000 in the
first three months of last year.
Most analysts attributed the rapid growth at the end of last year to sharp
tariff cuts, a fall in the price of handsets, a pre-Christmas rush and the
launch in September of Mercury One-2-One, a third operator offering free
calls at evenings and weekends inside the M25 area.
Mr Bob Warner, Cellnet managing director, predicted that total UK cellular
subscriber numbers would reach 3m by the end of the year, up from 2m at the
end of 1993. 'Two years ago we were adding cellular customers at the rate of
2,000 a month; now it is 2,000 a day,' he said.
The continued boom points to strong underlying growth, however, in
particular from the entry of the mobile phone into the consumer market.
The launch next month of Orange, the UK's fourth cellular network, is
expected to boost the market further. Orange, a joint venture between
Hutchison Whampoa and British Aerospace, will cover 90 per cent of the
population by the middle of next year.

FT  25 MAR 94 / Foreign banks in London top 500
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The number of foreign banks in London topped 500 for the first time last
year, enhancing the capital's status as Europe's most significant financial
centre.
According to a survey by Noel Alexander Associates, a consultancy which
specialises in financial statistics, the 15 foreign banks that disappeared
from London - either through leaving or through mergers and takeovers - were
more than offset by the 35 which arrived, making the total 514.
The survey, which is published each year, reflects the changes to
international banking in London.
Two of the new banks that opened were from Russia; two from the Czech
republic; one from former Yugoslavia, and one from Slovenia. Two were from
China, three from Hong Kong and one from Thailand.
Six of the 15 banks which disappeared did so as a result of mergers and
takeovers. Western European banks accounted for five of these, with the
remaining one being the takeover of the Canadian Royal Trust Bank by Royal
Bank of Canada.

FT  25 MAR 94 / Heseltine 'damaging Post Office' with delay in review
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, was yesterday attacked
by MPs for damaging the Post Office by prolonging his review of its future.
The Commons trade and industry committee, which has a Conservative majority,
added to the cabinet debate over whether to exclude radical measures from
next year's legislative programme by urging Mr Heseltine to publish the
conclusions of the review and plans for any legislative action 'without
delay'.
Sir Cranley Onslow, a former chairman of the 1922 committee of Tory
backbenchers, said: 'What we are saying is we want to see a bill in the next
session.'
Mr Heseltine has said that there is a strong economic case for privatising
the Royal Mail - the Post Office's letters division - but has indicated that
political considerations have prevented him from doing so.
Many Tory backbenchers, particularly those threatened by Liberal Democrats
in the south-west of England, are worried about the impact of privatisation
on rural postal services.
A report by the committee, published yesterday, did not give its own
proposals on the Post Office's future - so hiding party political divisions.
Mr Keith Hampson, a Tory member of the committee, indicated that he favoured
privatising the Royal Mail, while Labour's Mr Michael Clapham argued that
the three Post Office divisions - Royal Mail, Parcelforce and Post Office
Counters - should be kept together.
The committee pinned the blame for uncertainty over the corporation's future
on Mr Heseltine, saying: 'It would appear that no new information or
research is awaited, only ministerial decisions.'
It said that while the review - which has lasted 20 months and cost Pounds
1.3m - continues, 'the Post Office has seen competitors attack its core
markets, but has been unable to fight back because, as a public sector body,
it faces government restrictions on its activities'.
'The growth of competition is made particularly harmful to the Post Office
by the uncertainty over its future,' it added.
The committee supported the Post Office's contention that it should be free
to raise money without being constrained by the public sector borrowing
requirement.

FT  25 MAR 94 / Trainmaker to cut 700 jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nearly 700 jobs are to go at ABB Transportation, the Derby-based
manufacturer of railway rolling stock, the company said yesterday. It warned
that a further 600 job cuts may be necessary.
The first round of redundancies follows completion of a contract to modify
diesel trains for British Rail Regional Railways and the running down of
work on an order for London Underground's Central Line. A second round will
be necessary if ABB fails to win an order for 100 Northern Line trains.
London Underground, along with Conservative and Labour MPs and a consortium
of London businesses, have urged the Treasury to allow the Pounds 740m
Northern Line contract to go ahead as part of the government's private
finance initiative. The Treasury has said that the project does not meet its
requirements for the transfer of risk to the private sector.
Mr Bo Sodersten, ABB chief executive, said: 'It is desperately disappointing
for the company to be in this position. We are doing everything we can to
secure orders.'
ABB, formerly British Rail Engineering, is part of the Swiss/Swedish Asea
Brown Boveri Group. It employs 5,400 people in Derby, Crewe and York. A
total of 2,500 work at Derby - the works which will be hit by the 700
redundancies and the 600 possible job losses.
ABB yesterday announced a 1993 pre-tax loss of Pounds 9.8m on turnover of
Pounds 518m from UK business. The losses include Pounds 12.4m to meet
redundancy and other restructuring costs.
Mr Wilf Proudfoot of the RMT transport union, said: 'It takes a special kind
of incompetence to eliminate skilled manufacturing jobs when years of work
rebuilding our railways is available.'
Mr Frank Dobson, shadow transport secretary, said the redundancies were 'a
direct result of rail privatisation'.

FT  25 MAR 94 / Employers told to end job advert age limits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Employers were yesterday urged by the government not to state age limits in
job advertisements and take other positive measures to end discrimination
against older workers.
Miss Ann Widdecombe, the employment minister, launching a campaign against
ageism in the workplace, said 40 per cent of employers admitted
discriminating on age grounds.
She said age bars could be as low as 30 and some employers had refused to
promote or train older workers, selecting the oldest first for redundancy.
More than 5,000 copies of a booklet called Getting On will be sent to
Jobcentres and large employers.
Miss Widdecombe said: 'If the way to employers' hearts is through
productivity or profit margins, they should all be in love with the idea of
an older workforce. They are as adaptable as their younger counterparts and
their commitment and loyalty is often greater.'
Miss Widdecombe said she had looked at anti-ageism measures in other
countries including the US, where it is illegal to use age limits in
advertisements. But she said such measures had not been effective and she
did not want to put additional burdens on employers.

FT  25 MAR 94 / Cellnet rise underlines phone surge

Cellnet, the second largest mobile phone operator, has passed the million

After record growth in the run-up to Christmas, Cellnet had expected a sharp
slow-down in new connections. But it is projecting a gross 70,000 new

By the end of this month Cellnet, a joint venture between British

The continued boom points to strong underlying growth, however, in
particular from the entry of the mobile phone into the consumer market.
The UK's cellular market is growing in line with that in the US and on the
Continent. According to the FT's mobile communications newsletter, the
number of western European subscribers grew 53 per cent in the year to
February 1, with new networks exposing former monopolies to competition in
most of the European Union's larger countries.
The UK now has about 3.5 cellular subscribers per 100 people, ahead of
Germany (2.3) and France (one), but behind the Scandinavian countries, which
have between seven and 10 subscribers per 100 people.
The launch next month of Orange, the UK's fourth cellular network, is
expected to boost the market further. Orange, a joint venture between
Hutchison Whampoa and British Aerospace, will cover 90 per cent of the
British population by the middle of next year.

FT  25 MAR 94 / Charities warned on politics
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Charity Commission yesterday set out a new code of practice
incorporating strict standards of behaviour and principles to be observed by
charities in political activities and campaigning.
The code says publicity material must not be biased and the results of any
research commissioned by charities must not be manipulated.
The proposed code follows a finding by the commission that Oxfam - Britain's
biggest charity - breached restrictions on political activity.
Mr Richard Fries, chief charity commissioner, said charities could not be
political bodies, but had a right to contribute to public discussion and
political debate. This had to be done in a way that reflected their
experience and was in line with the objectives of their charitable trust.
'They must, however, exercise great care before engaging in activities of a
political nature,' he said.
At a news conference to launch the document, he said the guidance aimed to
give charities a 'thumb' on what they could and could not do.
Challenged on whether this meant an end to poster campaigns naming MPs and
how they vote, Mr Fries said the guidance only applied if a charity was
thought to be trying to 'apply public pressure' on MPs or the government.
Each case had to be examined in its own context. The 20-page document, which
is going out for consultation, gives advice on how to stay on the right side
of the law.
Oxfam, which was consulted in the drawing up of the revised code, said the
guidelines were much clearer and more positive about how and when charities
could campaign and get involved in political activities.

FT  25 MAR 94 / Number of foreign banks in London exceeds 500

The number of foreign banks in London topped 500 for the first time last
year, enhancing the capital's status as Europe's most significant financial
centre.
According to a survey by Noel Alexander Associates, a consultancy which
specialises in financial statistics, the 15 foreign banks that disappeared
from London - either through leaving or through mergers and takeovers - were
more than offset by the 35 which arrived.
There are 514 foreign banks in London.
The survey, which is published each year, reflects the changes to
international banking in London, with much of the activity coming from
eastern Europe and Asia.
Two of the new banks that opened were from Russia; two from the Czech
republic; one from former Yugoslavia, and one from Slovenia. Two were from
China, three from Hong Kong and one from Thailand.
Six of the 15 banks which disappeared did so as a result of mergers and
takeovers. Western European banks accounted for five of these, with the
remaining one being the takeover of the Canadian Royal Trust Bank by Royal
Bank of Canada.
Seven of the nine banks that actually left were from western Europe.
Last year also saw the first increase in the number of US banks in London
since 1982, as four US banks opened in the City.
Even so, this only takes the total back to its 1991 level of 49, which
itself was lower than every year since 1971.
The number of Japanese banks also rose again slightly, after a drop of two
in 1992, to reach 54 in total.
Noel Alexander says that London has a higher number of foreign banks than
any other city, including New York and Tokyo.

FT  25 MAR 94 / Britain opposed to milk quota cut
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain is to resist European Commission proposals for a 1 per cent cut in
its common agricultural policy milk quota from April 1, Mrs Gillian
Shephard, agriculture minister, told the Commons last night.
She said the existing quota was insufficient and a further reduction would
deal 'a severe blow' to the British dairy industry. Her pledge was welcomed
by MPs on both sides of the Commons.
Mrs Shephard insisted that such a reduction was not justified by the
Commission's own analysis of the market. Nor was it necessary to meet
obligations imposed by the general agreement on tariffs and trade.
Britain, which had fought against the use of quotas in the first place, was
ideally suited to produce milk and wanted the jobs that were provided
through the manufacture of milk products.
Mrs Shephard said the proposed cuts would have an adverse impact on the
European Union's 1995 budget, largely because of the effect on the beef
sector and the need to provide a compensation package for producers.
Mr Gavin Strang, shadow agriculture minister, warned that some multinational
companies were threatening to switch investment elsewhere because they
feared there would not be sufficient milk available for the high-value
products they wished to make in Britain.

FT  25 MAR 94 / Anger at Scottish council's Elf loan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Orkney Islands Council has agreed to make an interest-free loan of Pounds
15m to help the oil company Elf Enterprise win new business in the North Sea
for its Flotta oil terminal on Orkney.
The loan, believed to be unprecedented, sparked anger in Orkney yesterday.
The money will go toward funding a project to bring gas condensate and
natural gas liquids from the Britannia field. Chevron and Conoco, which will
operate the field, have yet to decide how and where to transport its output.
The Pounds 15m will come from Orkney Council's harbour equalisation fund,
set up in the 1970s to accumulate revenues from the Flotta terminal and
prolong its life. The fund stands at about Pounds 60m.
The Flotta terminal receives oil from Elf Enterprise's Piper and Claymore
fields, as well as some smaller fields. Although it is handling between
310,000 and 315,000 barrels of oil a day, the flow is expected to decline
early in the next decade.
The fund was set up to help keep the terminal running after the flow of oil
has fallen to an uneconomic level.
Chevron and Conoco expect the Britannia field to come into production by the
end of 1998. They have the choice of piping the condensate either to Flotta
or to Cruden Bay, Aberdeenshire.
An alternative is to order a concrete instead of a steel production
platform. This would enable the condensate to be stored under the plaform
and shipped out in tankers, a solution unlikely to involve Flotta.
Orkney Council said the loan would be spent on building a spur pipeline from
Brittannia to the Flotta pipeline. The loan, which it said was being made at
Elf Enterprise's request, is guaranteed by a consortium of banks and is
dependent on the success of the move to bring Britannia's output to Flotta.
Mr Iain Macdonald, a council member, said other councillors had agreed to
the loan after minimal consultation. 'We were railroaded,' he said.
Elf Enterprise indicated that both it and the council had an interest in
prolonging the life of the terminal.

FT  25 MAR 94 / Threatened wages board gives farm workers 4.9%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN and DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Agricultural Wages Board has awarded farm workers a 4.9 per cent pay
rise from June - double the average rate for manual workers' pay settlements
this year.
Some farm workers said the large increase reflected the board's belief that
its days were numbered. The board's most recent awards have been more modest
 -between 2 per cent and 3 per cent.
Mrs Gillian Shephard, agriculture minister, told the Commons last night that
she hoped statements on the future of the English and Scottish agricultural
wages boards would be made next week.
The increase for casual agricultural workers is 2.5 per cent, which takes
the overall rise to 4.3 per cent. The settlement, which will cost the
farming industry Pounds 54.5m this year, was resisted by employers'
representatives on the board.
Mr Don Wilkinson, who led the employers' negotiating team, said: 'We had
impressed upon the board the need to take into account the financial
uncertainty facing farmers and growers in the years ahead.'
The settlement means an increase of Pounds 6.78 per week on the current
minimum rate of Pounds 138.31 for a farm worker in England and Wales.
Mrs Shephard refused to accept that the low pay level justified the
continued existence of the agricultural wages board, saying groups of
workers in manufacturing, hotels and catering, and the distributive trades
were in the same position. But she said the 'vast majority' of 4,000
responses to a consultation exercise were in favour of the board's
retention.
The Labour party said it was crucial that all the activities of the board
should continue but it feared that the government would retain the form but
not the substance. It added that the latest award would still make
agricultural pay less than three-quarters of the average for industrial
workers.

FT  25 MAR 94 / 'Technofear' hits used car prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Used car buyers are coming to fear expensive new technology so much that
standard models are starting to have a higher resale value than
top-specification vehicles of the same type, a senior executive of Glass's
Guide, the used car values directory, said yesterday.
Mr Leslie Allen, director and managing editor of the guide - regarded as the
motor trade's bible - also predicted that the higher resale value of diesel
cars compared with their petrol counterparts will have been eliminated by
the middle of next year, as supply and demand for diesel cars came into
balance.
Glass's conclusions about growing technophobia in the used car market are
potentially very bad news both for volume carmakers, which earn high margins
on vehicles laden with electronic systems, and executive and luxury
carmakers.
Volume producers already face having to make less well-equipped new cars
because of new company car tax legislation, effective next month, which
links employees' personal tax bills directly with cars' list prices.
The trend can only be accelerated by the prospect of steeper falls in
residual values of high-specification models if used car buyers - almost
always private motorists - shun them as the cars move from company fleets to
dealer forecourts.
It may also increase the depreciation rate of executive and luxury cars,
typically loaded with complex electronic systems such as traction control
and multi-mode automatic gearboxes which private motorists fear will be
expensive if they break down. Electronic control modules alone for such
systems can cost several hundred pounds.
Mr Allen said: 'We have reached the threshold of the ridiculous state where
a bog-standard Carlton, for example, will make more money than the
all-singing and dancing version.'

FT  25 MAR 94 / Motor traders' margins whittled down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Some carmakers are cutting or eliminating dealer margins on selected models
to reduce list prices and intensify competition.
Volvo, Renault and Ford have already made such moves and carmakers and
dealers believe the new pricing initiatives could have a far-reaching impact
on the relationship between manufacturers and the retail motor trade.
They could also affect tax revenue take, as the new company car tax scheme
to be introduced next month is based on the list price rather than the
transaction price, which would normally include a significant discount.
Volvo, the Swedish carmaker, has eliminated the previous 10 per cent dealer
margin on the 1.6 litre Volvo 440/460, the cheapest in its range. Before the
move these models had an on-the-road price - including delivery charge - of
Pounds 10,865. This has been cut to Pounds 9,970, allowing dealers to
advertise a new Volvo at under Pounds 10,000.
Instead of the margin, Volvo dealers are now being given a handling charge
of Pounds 130 per car for these models, which still count in a dealer's
total sales and qualify for the monthly volume bonuses given if the dealer
reaches sales targets set by the manufacturer.
Renault, the French carmaker, has taken similar action on some of its
cheapest models, but is offering a higher handling charge to dealers.
Ford, the market leader, has used similar tactics for the launch of its new
Ford Probe coupe. The cheapest model is priced at Pounds 15,995 and dealers
are being given a handling charge of about Pounds 1,000.
Ford insisted last night it had no plans to spread this practice across its
range, but said: 'This allows us to decrease the list price, which makes the
car more competitive in the market place.'
In the Ford case the high handling charge still gives the dealer some room
for manoeuvre, but the effective margin has still been cut to just over 6
per cent from 10 per cent across the rest of the range.
Vauxhall, which led the move two-and-a-half years ago to reduce dealer
margins from the traditional 17 per cent to the current industry average of
10 per cent, said last night: 'We are not planning any initiative in this
area, but we are watching what is going on.'
Volvo accepted that the actual transaction price paid by the customer on its
cheapest models had not changed but said the elimination of the dealer
margin had removed any discount and haggling, and the list price now
represented the transaction price.

FT  25 MAR 94 / Coal bill provokes wrath of landowners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Conservative party faces a protest campaign from some of its most
traditional supporters - owner-occupier farmers and landed gentry - over the
government's policies on state industry sell-offs.
The Country Landowners' Association yesterday threatened to 'hound and
harass' the government over the coal industry privatisation bill because of
its 'creeping erosion of land and property rights'. The CLA, with 50,000
members in England and Wales, is angry at the way the government has passed
compulsory powers of access to and acquisition of land from publicly owned
industries to the private sector.
The bill's present provisions have heightened that concern, and the CLA is
urging members to protest to Conservative associations.
'Our members are getting fed up with subsidising shareholders in what were
once publicly owned industries,' said Mr John Henderson, vice chairman of
the CLA's Yorkshire branch, its largest.
'There is a case for compulsory powers where land is needed for the public
good, but privatisation should not mean a licence to rip off private
landowners to subsidise dividends paid to shareholders of private
companies.'
Mr Henderson - chairman of the Coal Liaison Group, set up by the CLA and
others to try to amend the coal bill - said he did not think the government
understood the anger among his members. 'Let's have a level playing field
for all concerned,' he said.

FT  25 MAR 94 / Lib Dems reveal Tory poll fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Liberal Democrats yesterday sought to undermine the morale of
Conservative activists gathering for a weekend conference by unveiling a
leaked document revealing alarm within the Tory party over the Liberal
Democrat threat.
The 16-page document, written by a Conservative Central Office researcher
shortly after the 1992 general election, states that the 'Liberal Democrats
in the 1990s have to be taken as a serious threat by both the two major
parties'.
It says that Conservatives 'must wake up to the fact that no seat in the
whole of the south-west can any longer be taken for granted as 'safe'', and
that the Liberal Democrat resurgence means the Conservative party 'is faced
with the very real threat of losing its majority at the next general
election'.
Mr Matthew Taylor, Liberal Democrat chairman of campaigns, said yesterday
that the document showed how concerned the Tories were about prospects in
the forthcoming local and European elections.
The release of the research paper coincides with the start of the annual
Conservative Central Council in Plymouth, seen as an opportunity for Tory
managers to take their election campaign into the Liberal Democrat
heartland.
Mr Taylor said the document showed why the Tories were convening in
Plymouth. 'That is why they are attacking us on a daily basis, why we
believe they are right to be worried,' he said.
The research document predicts that, in the European elections in June this
year, the Euro seats of Cornwall and Plymouth, and Somerset and Dorset West
would be 'very vulnerable: on the basis of 1992 voting the Liberal Democrats
require only a 5 per cent swing to take either of them'.
Yesterday, Sir Norman Fowler, Conservative party chairman, accused the
Liberal Democrats of being 'Labour's bedfellows' and 'leftwing
opportunists'. He told journalists in London that the Liberal Democrats were
'a party of the left for the left'. He added: 'Like Labour, their activists
and MPs remain committed to higher taxes, higher spending, more state
intervention and greater union power.'
The counter-attack will not disguise the difficulties the Conservatives face
in Plymouth, with the conference certain to be dominated by the growing
storm over Britain's voting powers in an enlarged European Union.

FT  25 MAR 94 / Cancer map shows regional contrasts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Striking regional variations are revealed by the first atlas of cancer
incidence in England and Wales, published yesterday, Clive Cookson writes.
The atlas, commissioned by the Cancer Research Campaign, shows that lung
cancer, the most common form of the disease in men, is much more prevalent
in the north than in the south. The reverse is true for breast cancer, the
most common cancer in women.
Dr Isabel Silva and Dr Anthony Swerdlow of the London School of Hygiene and
Tropical Medicine analysed information about 3m new cancer patients between
1968 and 1985 to give a county-by-county variation in cancer risks. They
compared these with the geographical distributions of risk factors such as
smoking and occupation. The figures in the map above are an index of the
number of new cases in each county over the period.
In some cancers there is an obvious link with risk factors. The north-south
gradient in lung cancer is caused mainly by the greater prevalence of
smoking in the north. The authors say that greater industrial exposures to
smoke, dust and toxic fumes in the north are not sufficient to account for
the regional differences.
Malignant melanoma, the most virulent skin cancer, has a strong south/north
gradient - someone living on the south coast is three times more likely to
suffer than someone in northern England. There is a clear correlation with
hours of sunshine.
The reason why breast and ovarian cancers are more common in the south is
not obvious. The fact that southern women have fewer children on average may
be a partial explanation, Drs Silver and Swerdlow say, because they have
higher levels of the hormones related to these cancers.

FT  25 MAR 94 / Equality law audit breaches shown
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Many British companies are breaking the law by failing to provide adequate
information on equal opportunities policies in their annual accounts, three
academics said yesterday.
From a sample of 100 companies, 34 fully complied with disclosures required
by law on policy towards disabled employees while 14 made no mention of the
disabled at all. The findings were presented by Ms Carol Adams, Mr Andrew
Coutts and Mr George Harte at the annual British Accounting Association
conference at King Alfred's College in Winchester. They found that the Post
Office, with nearly one page, provided the most detail on equal
opportunities. The average length was just 0.13 of a page. Among businesses
which provided scant information on disabled employees were General
Electric, British Airways and British Telecommunications. Very few companies
described issues such as career breaks, flexible contracts or paternity
leave.
Most did not show the composition of the workforce by ethnic background or
monitoring policy. The conference heard that auditors who tender for work
and are tied to a fixed-fee contract are less likely to discover material
mis-statements in company accounts.
The survey - based on 70 Australian auditors - showed detection rose as the
length of client relationship increased.

FT  25 MAR 94 / Cost of spying 9% less than expected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday revealed for the first time the full cost and
extent of Britain's secret world of spies and electronic eavesdropping.
The news was unexpectedly good for taxpayers, who will pay about 9 per cent
less than anticipated this year, and bad for the spooks, whose numbers are
falling fast as a result of the end of the cold war.
For decades, governments have refused to reveal the cost and extent of MI5,
the domestic intelligence service, MI6, the secret intelligence service, and
GCHQ, the radio and telephone monitoring complex at Cheltenham. The figures
see the light of day for the first time in Downing Street's estimates,
tabled in the Commons, of the cost of running the Cabinet Office, the Privy
Council and parliament in 1994-95.
The estimates show that the staff of the three services is forecast to fall
from 10,766 at the end of the 1993-94 financial year to 10,516 at the end of
1994-95, at a cost of Pounds 9.4m in superannuation payments.
In spite of the fall in numbers, the services' running costs will rise from
Pounds 430m to Pounds 450m - a 4.5 per cent increase, which is comfortably
in excess of the pay freeze imposed by the government on most other public
servants.
Nevertheless, the overall cost of spying is forecast to fall from Pounds
975m to Pounds 881m, mainly as a result of a fall in the cost of supplying
MI5 and MI6 with new offices. The main saving will on Thames House, the
palatial London building being converted into MI5's headquarters, which is
now expected to cost Pounds 245m instead of Pounds 266m.
Embarrassingly, the intelligence services seem to have got their sums wrong:
the estimates reveal that the original estimate was 'inflated due to the use
of incorrect deflators'.
MI6 is costing less than expected too. Work on its London headquarters at
Vauxhall Cross will cost Pounds 84m instead of Pounds 93m because of a fall
in construction prices.
In a written parliamentary answer accompanying the estimates, Mr John Major,
the prime minister, said costs were expected to fall by a further 5 per cent
in 1996/97.
The release of the estimates fulfils a promise given by Mr Major in November
that the costs of running the three intelligence services would be brought
under the Cabinet Office. Until yesterday, the costs were split between the
Ministry of Defence, the Foreign Office, and the Cabinet Office, which kept
its share of the cost a secret.
The decision to publish is in line with the government's commitment to
reduce secrecy after the collapse of the former Soviet Union and the
lessening of tension throughout Europe.
However, the spooks have not entirely discarded the cloak of darkness. The
estimates warn that projects have been excluded 'where revealing the nature
and scale of expenditure could prejudice national security, inhibit the
operational effectiveness of the relevant service, or prejudice the safety
of staff'.

A Conservative party political agent was yesterday ordered to stand trial
accused of falsifying a proxy vote.
The High Court ruled that Barnet magistrates in north London 'perversely'
blocked the trial of Mr Miles Parker in May by refusing an adjournment after
prosecution lawyers had been misinformed about the time of the hearing.
Mr Parker, of Edmonton, north London, had faced two summonses of falsifying
a voter's postal ballot form and turning it into a proxy vote for a

Local education authorities were stripped last year of their supervisory
role for the service. The government wants a variety of local organisations

FT  25 MAR 94 / Record profit of Pounds 5.6m at ITN
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Independent Television News achieved its largest pre-tax profit last year -
Pounds 5.6m before exceptional items on a turnover of Pounds 83.3m, Raymond
Snoddy writes.
The figure represents a considerable turnaround for the commercial
television news organisation. Three years ago there was a cost overrun of
Pounds 10m and a growing financial crisis because of lease charges on its
then new headquarters in Gray's Inn Road, London.
There had been fears that the loss on the lease on the near-empty building
could reach Pounds 25m over five years. But the building has been filling up
slowly, mainly with media organisations.
The latest tenant is The European newspaper which plans to move from Orbit
House, part of the former Maxwell empire.

FT  25 MAR 94 / Job cuts claim at Swans rejected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Receivers at Swan Hunter, the Tyneside shipbuilder, last night rejected a
statement from union officials that a further 490 jobs at the yard would be
shed in May. The possibility of the job losses had been discussed earlier
this week at a meeting of full-time union officials and staff of Price
Waterhouse, the receivers.
Mr Gordon Horsfield, joint receiver, said: 'Nobody is denying there is the
risk of these job losses, which is why they formed the basis of the
discussion with the unions but by no means is it definite.'
The receivers will seek meetings with union officials today to clarify the
situation.
The reason for the potential cut of 380 blue-collar jobs and 110 staff posts
is the handing over on May 12 of HMS Northumberland, one of three Type 23
frigates that Swan Hunter was fitting out when it went into receivership in
May.
This leaves only one frigate in the yard, providing too little work for the
workforce of 1,038 - down from 2,500 when the receiver was called in.
Yesterday Swan Hunter submitted to the Ministry of Defence its tender for
the 18-month refit of the Sir Bedivere landing ship, a contract crucial to
the yard's survival. But even if it wins this work, for which it faces
competition from four other UK yards, it faces a gap of some months in which
it has much too little work to sustain the present workforce.
The receivers have described the remaining employees as the 'golden nugget'
which underpinned the yard's saleability as a going concern. A near-halving
of this number would raise questions about Swan Hunter's potential to
survive as a large shipbuilder.
Mr Horsfield said job sharing, layoffs, subcontracting and the possibility
of finding other work were among the avenues being explored in the hope of
averting the 490 losses.
Negotiations between French-owned Constructions Mecaniques de Normandie and
the receivers, which began in London on Wednesday, continued yesterday.
CMN had hoped to make a firm bid for Swan Hunter, conditional on the company
winning the Sir Bedivere order, before the tender for the refit was
submitted yesterday. But last night, Price Waterhouse said there were 'loose
ends' still to be sorted out and it was likely to take two to three weeks to
reach any contractual commitment with CMN.

FT  25 MAR 94 / Judge aims to cure immunity system: The attorney-general is
under siege about the advice he gave to ministers over public interest
immunity certificates in the Matrix Churchill affair. John Mason reports
that far-reaching reform of the government's powers to suppress official
information now seems inevitable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Whatever the future job prospects of Sir Nicholas Lyell, the
attorney-general, it is clear that the Scott inquiry will lead to a thorough
overhaul of the government's use of public interest immunity (PII) to
control publication of official information.
The immediate aftermath of the Matrix Churchill trial led to accusations
that ministers had sought to use PII - the application to a judge for
approval not to disclose information - to protect the government by
preventing publication of embarrassing material in spite of it clearly being
of help to those in the dock.
Sir Nicholas yesterday dismissed this interpretation of events as 'utterly
untrue'. But the tense exchanges between himself and Lord Justice Scott
provided an extraordinary demonstration that two of the most senior legal
figures in the country could barely agree on anything about the application
of this controversial procedure.
This follows on from the admissions made to the inquiry by two figures
involved in the Matrix Churchill PII claims.
Mr Gerald Hosker, the Treasury solicitor, said that proper procedures had
not been adhered to and backed calls for reform of PII to apply it only in
limited circumstances.
Mr Alan Moses QC, the barrister who brought the prosecution for Customs &amp;
Excise, said the use of PII had damaged public confidence in the criminal
justice system. PII procedure, he agreed, had to be changed.
In yesterday's exchanges, the main dispute concerned whether ministers have
any discretion to sign PII certificates.
Sir Nicholas began by maintaining that such discretion did not exist, except
in rare cases. It was for the trial judge alone to take the decision. It was
this advice he had given Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary,
who was originally reluctant to sign his certificate.
The exception, Sir Nicholas said in a statement at the start of the hearing,
was based upon a ruling in a civil case in 1989. He said this allowed
ministers the discretion not to apply for PII 'where there is a clear
balance in favour of disclosure in the interests of justice'.
But he added: 'This exception must not be invoked lightly. It would be wrong
for the minister to rely upon it unless advised by counsel, who will
inevitably have a far greater familiarity with the issues in the case, that
there is indeed a clear balance in favour of disclosure.'
Lord Justice Scott was insistent in probing whether ministers should
ultimately decide if there was a serious risk of damage to the public
interest before applying for PII.
Before 1968, the courts had no power to challenge a minister's assertion
that documents should not be disclosed. The House of Lords then made two
crucial rulings - first, that such claims could be challenged in the courts,
and second, that the government could use classes of privilege to apply for
PII. These classes cover areas such as national security, the identity of
informers and advice to ministers.
The rulings allowed the challenging of ministers' judgments, but the ability
to use class immunity has since been a means of applying for PII over an
increasingly wide range of documents.
Lord Justice Scott and Sir Nicholas clashed on a 1989 ruling by Lord Justice
Bingham that ministers have a duty to assert PII that cannot be waived. But
the ruling also allowed for voluntary disclosure where the public interest
was plainly in favour of it. It is this which provides the exception that
Sir Nicholas agreed could allow ministers to use their discretion.
It was on this point, under pressure from an increasingly irate judge, that
the attorney-general apparently shifted his position.
A minister would take advice from prosecuting counsel over whether
disclosure was plainly in the interests of justice, he said. However, he
admitted, a minister remained able to ignore the barrister's advice and
decide to disclose documents if he felt this appropriate. This admission
appeared to contradict what he had said in his opening statement two hours
previously.
However, after the lunchtime news headlines said he had back-tracked on his
main argument, Sir Nicholas issued a second statement. Matrix Churchill had
not been one of these exceptional cases and his advice to Mr Heseltine
remained correct, he said.
If ministerial discretion dominated these exchanges, the class immunity
system has caused equal alarm among lawyers. To legal observers, the most
telling evidence given to the inquiry on this subject was provided by Mr
Andrew Leithead, an assistant Treasury solicitor involved in the Matrix
Churchill claims.
The government was always 'generous' in the range of documents for which it
sought to claim PII and only the most trivial of documents should not be
subjected to claims, he said. The confidentiality of the Whitehall
decision-making process had to be protected as a matter of principle, he
said.
It was this illustration of how Whitehall operates that alarmed many
observers.
One defence solicitor responded: 'It was the clearest demonstration that,
when Whitehall thinking is allowed to go to extremes, it completely fails to
allow for common sense - or any appreciation of the world outside the civil
service. It is quite, quite, terrifying.'
It seems certain that Lord Justice Scott will recommend that the government
reforms PII. Within the criminal bar there is widespread agreement that
these recommendations must be far-reaching and concentrate on reducing the
amount of information withheld to the bare minimum.
Mr Roy Amlot QC, a leading defence silk and former Treasury counsel, said:
'He (Lord Justice Scott) will certainly go to town on procedure and tighten
ministerial responsibility. The first essential is that it should no longer
be possible to use classes of documents to claim PII. He must insist it is
only claimed on a document-by-document basis and only when there is a
genuine public interest against disclosure.'

FT  25 MAR 94 / Smith to paint Labour as a friend of small business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Smith will today portray Labour as the friend of small business when
he maps out a raft of ideas for improving the flow of investment to the
sector.
The Labour leader will use a speech to small business leaders in Edinburgh
to argue that his party and the sector are 'natural allies' in the battle to
create new jobs.
He will emphasise that Labour shares the sector's worries about red tape and
that it will 'happily get rid of any regulations that are pointless and out
of date'.
Mr Smith will underline Labour's support for the creation of a statutory
right for companies to charge interest on overdue debts.
Referring to a need to devise ways of channelling money towards small firms,
Mr Smith will say that Labour would seriously consider setting up a
private-sector managed investment fund focusing on small business.
According to Mr Smith, Labour also believes there is a 'strong case' for
expanding the small business loan guarantees scheme.
A document covering Labour's proposed approach to industry, which it is
planning for this year's conference, is to contain a chapter on small
business, Mr Smith will announce.

FT  25 MAR 94 / Insurers admit role in pension fears survey
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two of the UK's leading life insurers have admitted to MPs that they took
part in the pilot survey which sparked public concern about the mis-selling
of personal pensions to people transferring out of occupational schemes.
TSB Life and Standard Life responded to a letter from the Commons social
security committee by saying that theirs were among the files examined by
accountancy firm KPMG Peat Marwick.
This is the first official confirmation from any of the 61 survey
participants.
The study, published in December, concluded that in nine out of 10 pension
transfer cases no evidence could be found that sales agents had met
regulators' requirements.
Regulators have emphasised that the findings of the KPMG study were
representative of the industry as a whole, but companies have still been
unwilling to reveal their participation.
As part of the committee's inquiry into aspects of personal pensions, Mr
Frank Field, the Labour MP who chairs the committee, had written to seven
leading life companies asking if they had been included in the report.
After originally refusing to answer the question, Lloyds Abbey Life backed
away from a clash with the committee saying it had not taken part.
Prudential and Pearl Assurance have also said their files were not in the
survey.
The other two companies - Legal &amp; General and Allied Dunbar - have so far
failed to give information on the query.
Although their replies did not anger MPs - as the letter from Lloyds Abbey
Life did - the committee is still likely to pursue the issue.
Its determination to discover who took part in the study stemmed from
concern about the basis of the survey.
The Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief regulator, which
commissioned the survey, has refused to say who the participants were.
The committee will begin evidence-taking sessions after Easter, and will
hear at an early stage from Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary.
It has not yet decided which life companies to summon as witnesses.
Pension transfers have also arisen in the context of the Treasury
committee's inquiry into financial regulation.
Commons select committees have wide-ranging powers to call for persons,
papers and records.
Labour has chosen the private pensions sector as the subject for a full-day
debate in the Commons next Wednesday.

FT  25 MAR 94 / Teachers to lodge part-timer pay claims
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Thousands of part-time teachers are preparing to lodge retrospective
compensation claims against local authorities in the light of the recent
House of Lords ruling on part-time workers, the National Union of Teachers
said yesterday.
The ruling, based on European law, found that the qualifying period for
unfair dismissal protection and redundancy pay for part-timers should be the
same as full-timers - two years instead of the current five.
The NUT said those who lost their jobs without the compensation the ruling
requires would be urged to claim. It said that claims had to be lodged
before June 3.
Other employers, particularly retailers and local authorities, could face
expensive retrospective compensation claims from tens of thousands of
part-time workers dismissed since 1976.

FT  25 MAR 94 / Jailed adviser is banned by SIB
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Securities and Investments Board has indefinitely banned from the
securities industry Mr Christopher Fallon, who is serving a nine-month
prison sentence.
Mr Fallon is the second person banned from securities or investment
activities under Section 59 of the Financial Services Act. The first was Mr
Roger Levitt, who was convicted of fraud charges and who received a
non-custodial sentence.
Mr Fallon, who operated Fallon and Co, based in north London, had presented
himself as an expert in futures and options. But he was not authorised to
conduct investment business.
Last July, SIB, the City's chief regulatory watchdog, secured an injunction
barring him from conducting investment business after it was discovered that
he was giving advice. Mr Fallon then breached that injunction by taking
Pounds 24,000 from two individuals.
The watchdog then applied to the High Court for a prison sentence for
violating the injunction. That request was granted last week, and he was
jailed for contempt.
The Pounds 24,000 has not been recovered and because Mr Fallon was not
authorised to conduct investment business, the investors will not be allowed
to make claims upon the Investors Compensation Scheme.
SIB said it viewed the case as evidence that civil prosecution could secure
more punitive terms for wrongdoers in certain cases than a criminal
prosecution could.
At least four other Section 59 cases are pending before SIB. Individuals
charged in such cases have the right to appeal against a decision and seek a
hearing.

FT  25 MAR 94 / Few defend Lyell as lawyers bet on his successor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It could have been worse. Sir Nicholas Lyell's appearance before the Scott
inquiry yesterday did not end in calls for his head from Conservative MPs.
But as the dust settled, few of the attorney-general's colleagues were
rushing to defend him.
Downing Street indignantly denied suggestions that Mr John Major's lukewarm
defence of the attorney-general at question time in the Commons suggested
that he was preparing to sacrifice Sir Nicholas.
But it was noted on the Tory back benches that the prime minister had failed
to take an ideal opportunity to reinforce his beleaguered minister.
Some MPs said Sir Nicholas's best hope was that he would be protected by the
sheer complexity of the issues involved in his advice to ministers on the
rules covering public interest immunity certificates.
Few MPs profess to understand the legal subtleties; most say their postbag
confirms that the general public is no better informed.
However, both MPs and voters understand that innocent men could have gone to
prison in the Matrix Churchill case because ministers suppressed evidence on
Sir Nicholas's advice.
MPs were also drawing a contrast between Sir Nicholas's refusal to answer
Commons questions, and his decision to give a raft of interviews on the eve
of his inquiry appearance.
One Conservative backbencher said: 'If he wanted to defend himself he should
have been doing it on the floor of the Commons, not in front of the TV
cameras.'
Underlying the issues is a widespread feeling that Sir Nicholas is out of
his depth; a pleasant man who is not really up to the job. Many Conservative
MPs say that he can probably benefit the government more by going.
One said: 'I think his position is becoming untenable. I don't think he will
go before the summer, but I can't see how he can escape being one of the
fall-guys for Scott.'
Perhaps the best indication of the attorney-general's weak position came
from the law courts, where his legal friends were taking bets last night on
his successor.
Some were tipping Sir Derek Spencer, the solicitor-general, who looks like a
strong contender because of his position as deputy to Sir Nicholas.
Mr Douglas Hogg, the Foreign Office minister, was also being mentioned by
leading barristers as a candidate. However, the well-bred legal fraternity
was too well mannered to say that Mr Hogg might command more respect from
both his political and legal colleagues than the beleaguered incumbent.

FT  25 MAR 94 / ITN profits at record Pounds 5.6m as property troubles
recede
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Independent Television News achieved its largest ever pre-tax profit last
year - Pounds 5.6m before exceptional items on a turnover of Pounds 83.3m.
The figure represents a considerable turnaround in three years for the
commercial television news organisation. Then there was a cost overrun of
Pounds 10m and a growing financial crisis because of lease charges on its
new headquarters in Gray's Inn Road, London.
There was a fear that the loss on the lease on the near-empty building could
reach Pounds 25m over five years. But the building has been filling up
slowly, mainly with media organisations.
The latest tenant will be The European newspaper which plans to move from
Orbit House, part of the former Maxwell empire. When it takes over the
seventh floor in the summer, the ITN building will be 95 per cent occupied.
ITN was virtually forced to become a profitmaking organisation by the 1990
Broadcasting Act. Previously, it was jointly owned by all the ITV companies.
The act said 51 per cent of ITN had to be owned by non-ITV companies by the
end of this year, although the consortium that now owns ITN hopes to
persuade the government to change its mind.

The head of Canada's central bank told the Senate banking committee in
Ottawa yesterday he had no target level for the Canadian dollar but that
interest rates could rise again, following Tuesday's increase, if there were
signs of a loss of confidence, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal.
The Canadian dollar has been under pressure since recent rises in US
short-term interest rates. On Tuesday the Bank of Canada lifted the bank
rate by 78 basis points to 5 per cent after the US Federal Reserve tightened
US rates by a further quarter point.
The Canadian dollar dropped from about 74 US cents to 73.03 cents on Monday.
It firmed to 73.16 cents after the interest rate increase, but yesterday it
slipped back to below 73 cents.
Mr Gordon Thiessen said the Canadian economy's fundamentals pointed to
strengthening recovery. But it was too early to predict how long market
volatility would last.

FT  25 MAR 94 / Philip Morris sues over TV tobacco claim
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Philip Morris yesterday filed a Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.7bn) libel lawsuit
against the US television network ABC alleging an ABC current affairs
programme broadcast false and defamatory statements last month when it
claimed the tobacco manufacturer was adding extra nicotine to its cigarettes
to make them more addictive.
The lawsuit is the latest offensive by Philip Morris and the US tobacco
industry, which is facing increasingly intense opposition to its cigarette
products from politicians and anti-smoking groups. In the past year Philip
Morris has sued the city of San Francisco over its strict anti-smoking laws
and the Environmental Protection Agency for its claims that second-hand
cigarette smoke causes cancer in non-smokers.
The industry also faces a tough fight in Congress over President Clinton's
plan to help pay for healthcare reform by a sharp rise in cigarette tax.
In its lawsuit against ABC, Philip Morris says that on February 28 the
network's Day One current affairs programme claimed the company was
'spiking' its cigarettes with extra nicotine in order to keep smokers
'hooked'. Philip Morris says ABC made the allegations even though it knew
them to be untrue, and that the network subsequently repeated the claims in
later programmes.
Although an ABC spokesman said it stood by the report, Wall Street was
unnerved and shares in the network's parent company, Capital Cities/ABC,
fell Dollars 16 to Dollars 702 3/4 .
Philip Morris said it was seeking Dollars 5bn in punitive damages, and
another Dollars 5bn as compensation for the impact the allegations had on
the company's share price, which dropped Dollars 2 to Dollars 56 in heavy
trading the day after the ABC broadcast. Philip Morris also noted that after
ABC made its allegations, members of Congress called for investigations into
cigarette manufacturing processes, and both President Bill Clinton and Mr
David Kessler, head of the Food and Drug Administration, expressed concern.
One reason why the share prices of Philip Morris and other tobacco makers
fell sharply following the Day One item was that the programme prompted a
suggestion by the FDA that if the allegations of 'spiking' were true there
might be a legal basis for regulating cigarettes as a drug.
Philip Morris insists that while nicotine occurs naturally in a tobacco
leaf, it does not add extra nicotine to cigarettes during production.

FT  25 MAR 94 / Healthcare reform manages a few steps through Congress
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
After weeks in which the Whitewater affair has seemed to drain all vitality
from President Bill Clinton's legislative agenda, Washington looked up this
week to discover that several steps had been taken towards the president's
number one goal of healthcare reform.
Late on Wednesday night, the first complete healthcare reform bill was voted
through by the health Ways and Means subcommittee, chaired by Congressman
Pete Stark of California, which has primary rights over the tax aspects of
the plan.
That draft is likely to be substantially rewritten by the full Ways and
Means committee, and then hammered some more to fit with the drafts of other
House of Representatives committees. The same process is under way in the
Senate, and the final shape of the bill will be determined when the two
chambers get together to reconcile their different versions.
The Stark committee's vote, by only a 6-5 margin, offers, nevertheless, a
first symbolic victory for some central elements of the Clinton plan:
universal health coverage ensured by requiring employers to offer insurance
to their employees and pay for 80 per cent of its cost.
That requirement would begin in 1996 for businesses with 100 or more
employees, and two years later for smaller employers.
To finance the bill's broader health coverage, however, the subcommittee
voted to raise the cigarette tax from 24 cents a pack to Dollars 1.49, much
more than the 75 cents increase proposed by Mr Clinton.
Congressman Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois, chairman of the full Ways and
Means committee, warned that he was likely to pass out a much more
conservative bill than Mr Stark's subcommittee.
Another important version of the bill is circulating in the House Energy and
Commerce committee, chaired by Congressman John Dingell of Michigan. That
version would preserve universal health insurance, but eliminate two
controversial elements of the Clinton plan: mandatory government-run health
insurance purchasing alliances, and for businesses with fewer than 10
employees, the requirement that employers provide insurance for their
workers.
White House officials are now stepping back to leave most of the detailed
work on healthcare reform to such congressional heavyweights as Mr Dingell
and Mr Rostenkowski.
Republican members of the Ways and Means subcommittee engineered a symbolic
defeat for the White House by forcing a vote on the un-altered Clinton plan:
with Democratic members abstaining, it lost.
But this procedural manoeuvre seems unlikely to have done very much to
clarify the Republican strategy on healthcare reform.
As Congressman Bill Thomas of California, senior Republican on the
subcommittee, lucidly explained: 'Please listen to me, because I don't want
anyone to think that what we're doing is what we're doing.'
Beneath their continued hostility to the Clinton plan, most Republicans have
now accepted the goal of universal coverage. Many acknowledge privately that
it will be very difficult to achieve that goal without also adopting large
portions of Mr Clinton's bill, or something even less palatable.

FT  25 MAR 94 / Whitewater hearings 'to begin by May'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Senator Bob Dole, the Republican leader, yesterday predicted the US Congress
could begin its investigation into the Whitewater affair by May 1. He
foresaw separate hearings by both House and Senate.
The prospect of congressional hearings was certain to be raised at last
night's prime time televised press conference, which President Bill Clinton
called to lay before a national audience his explanation of his past
investments in Arkansas and the many offshoots from it.
Polls yesterday indicated the Whitewater affair is eating into Mr Clinton's
popularity rating. The Washington Post-ABC poll recorded a drop in approval
to 47 per cent, 11 points below last month's levels. Other surveys have also
shown an erosion in support to around 50 per cent.
According to the poll, which surveyed 1,004 adults between last Friday and
Tuesday, 47 per cent of Americans approve of Mr Clinton's handling of the
presidency while 45 per cent disapprove and 7 per cent have no opinion.
Most polls show a public generally unpersuaded that Whitewater entails
serious wrongdoing on the part of the president or his wife. But each day
seems to bring some new reported allegation or distracting event. Yesterday,
for example, two senior White House aides, Mr George Stephanopoulos and Mr
Bruce Lindsey, told a federal grand jury what they knew about meetings at
which the state of regulatory investigations into a failed Arkansas savings
and loan company were discussed.
The White House has also been obliged to reassign internally one of its top
lawyers, Mr William Kennedy, after it was revealed he had failed to pay
social security taxes for a household employee. Mr Kennedy used to work for
the Rose Law Firm in Arkansas, where Mrs Hillary Clinton was a partner. Some
Republicans have demanded his dismissal.

FT  25 MAR 94 / If Cardoso runs, Brazil may pay: Angus Foster reports on
inflation's foe tempted by the presidency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso was recently asked what it was like to be
Brazil's finance minister, a tough job in a country plagued by near
hyper-inflation and discredited governments. 'It's not the worst job in
Brazil, it's the worst in the world,' he said.
After lasting nearly a year in the post - something of a record for a
Brazilian finance minister these days - Mr Cardoso appears to be preparing
to quit. Under Brazilian law he must do so by April 2 if, as widely
expected, he wants to run for president in elections in October.
But it is a difficult decision. Mr Cardoso's patiently negotiated plan to
bring down annual inflation of 2,500 per cent is not yet fully in force.
Economists say the plan is the most promising in recent years. But key
elements, such as a balanced budget, remain vulnerable to election-year
calls for higher spending.
In an otherwise weak government, Mr Cardoso is seen as the only politician
able to resist those calls. Even if he chooses his successor as finance
minister, the plan may still be in doubt.
His Brazilian Social Democrats party (PSDB) is small and has so far failed
to cement an alliance with a larger grouping. This is partly because of
uncertainty about the plan, which is seen as crucial to Mr Cardoso's
election chances.
But inflation is unlikely to fall until the plan's final phase and the
launch of a new currency, probably in May. Mr Cardoso must therefore decide
whether to run without knowing if he has done enough to hope for victory.
'He is under tremendous pressure from all sides,' according to a member of
Mr Cardoso's economic team. 'His party wants him to run. But it could
seriously damage the plan and our first real chance for ages to bring down
inflation.'
Mr Cardoso, 63 this June, is one of the outstanding Brazilians of his
generation. Born into a military family, he trained as a sociologist and
later taught at the University of California at Berkeley and Cambridge. His
best known works explored 'dependency', a theory which sought to explain
Latin America's underdevelopment as a consequence of the continent's
dependence on capital and technology from the US and Europe.
His links with the left incurred the ire of Brazil's military rulers in the
mid-1970s and he was banned from teaching at the University of Sao Paulo.
When democracy returned in 1984, Mr Cardoso switched from academia to
politics. After losing the race for mayor of Sao Paulo, he was elected a
senator in 1986. Two years later he helped found a new political party, the
PSDB.
Unusually in Brazil, the party and Mr Cardoso have a reputation for clean
government. Their policies are slightly left of centre and include social
welfare reform and income redistribution. But personality rather than
ideology wins Brazilian elections. Mr Cardoso's supporters claim he alone
can attract popular support from both the left and right.
Observers believe Mr Cardoso's broad appeal would provide a strong challenge
to either the current presidential favourite, Mr Luiz Inacio 'Lula' da Silva
of the left-wing Workers' party (PT), or a right-wing candidate such as Mr
Paulo Maluf, mayor of Sao Paulo.
His political strength stems from his experience and prestige in Congress.
As finance minister he has persuaded Congress to back his economic policies,
even though the government relies on a weak coalition for support. He has
also managed, at least so far, to persuade Congress of the need for a
balanced budget to fight inflation.
'Fernando has a great capacity of persuasion. He is the first person to
persuade the Brazilian public that the deficit is important,' says Mr
Antonio Delfim Netto, a former planning minister whose views have often not
coincided with Mr Cardoso's.
His other advantage is that, as a member of the country's elite, he has a
natural appeal among Brazil's middle classes and the media. Both groups are
wary of Mr da Silva's strong showing. Mr Cardoso has also won support from
some Sao Paulo businessmen, who would normally be wary of his soft-left
views and intellectual background.
There are still large question marks over Mr Cardoso's candidacy. The most
important is whether, as an intellectual and member of the elite, he can
attract enough support among workers. Although good on television, he is not
a natural orator and is uncomfortable with crowds. Last month he appeared on
a down-market TV game show. He looked awkward and out of touch with the
studio audience of housewives.
This drawback may be especially acute in the country's economically backward
north and north-east regions, where more than a third of the country's 90m
electors live. According to the latest opinion polls, Mr Cardoso would lose
badly to the more populist Mr da Silva in all states in that area.
Nationally, Mr Cardoso trails Mr da Silva by 31 per cent to 47 per cent. But
in big north-eastern states such as Bahia Mr Cardoso's support falls to 21
per cent.
Mr Francisco Weffort, a political scientist and PT supporter, describes Mr
Cardoso as 'a first rate politician with a vision of modernisation'. 'But he
just doesn't know how to link emotionally with the masses and in this
country that's important,' he says.

FT  25 MAR 94 / Mexican Crisis: Murder raises spectre of political
instability - Death of presidential front-runner comes on heels of Chiapas
uprising
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The assassination of Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio, the presidential candidate of
Mexico's ruling Institutional Revolutionary party, is certain to have a
traumatic impact on the country's political system.
Mr Colosio is the first major Mexican politician to be assassinated in more
than 50 years. Coming after the New Year peasant uprising in the southern
state of Chiapas, the killing is set to heighten national instability,
jeopardising the already fragile economic recovery.
The replacement of Mr Colosio by another candidate will not be easy.
Mexico's constitution prevents any official who has held senior government
office within six months of the election from running for office. Unless the
opposition parties agree to change the constitution, the list of credible
candidates is small.
'The situation is extremely worrying,' said Mr Sergio Aguayo, a political
scientist at the Colegio de Mexico. 'The crisis has shown up the weakness of
Mexican institutions.'
The effect on this August's presidential election is hard to predict. A weak
candidate or a financial crisis could enable the opposition to mount a
serious electoral challenge, putting at risk the PRI's 65-year hold on
power. But the party's domination is entrenched and its popularity is higher
than in 1988, making a defeat unlikely.
Mr Colosio, born in 1950 in the modest town of Magdalana de Kino, near the
US border, was chosen by Mr Salinas as the ruling party's candidate last
November. While not considered to be as articulate and forceful as other
contenders, he had long been favourite for the nomination and he appeared to
have the right mix of political and technocratic skills for the job.
He had recently begun the difficult task of distancing himself from Mr
Salinas, calling for a decentralisation of federal powers, reform of the
legal system, and a more active industrial policy. He had also made public
safety a central theme of his campaign.
Two days ago his route to the presidency seemed secure after the charismatic
Mr Manuel Camacho, the peace envoy to Chiapas, indicated he would not run
for the presidency. Mr Camacho, a former foreign minister and mayor of
Mexico City, had been passed over for the PRI's nomination in favour of Mr
Colosio, but subsequently had hinted he might seek the presidential
nomination of an opposition party.
In the immediate aftermath of Mr Colosio's assassination, Mr Camacho
appeared once again to be one of a handful of contenders in the ruling party
for its presidential nomination. But last night he indicated he was sticking
by his decision earlier this week to stay out of the presidential race.
While Mr Camacho is by far the best known of the potential candidates, and
the most experienced politically, he antagonised much of the party when he
looked as if he was going to challenge Mr Colosio.
Mr Salinas - who, it is assumed, will choose the new candidate as he chose
Mr Colosio - may be happy to look for a less controversial candidate. Unless
the law is changed to widen the field, possible candidates include Mr
Ernesto Zedillo, former education minister and Mr Colosio's campaign
manager, and Mr Fernando Ortiz Arana, president of the PRI.
If the opposition agrees to change the law, Mr Pedro Aspe, finance minister,
Mr Emilio Gamboa, transport minister, and Mr Emilio Lozoya, energy minister,
might be considered. All have disadvantages.
Mr Zedillo, a Yale University economist, is known for his political
inexperience. Mr Aspe has been widely blamed for the economic recession and
is not popular. Mr Gamboa and Mr Lozoya are junior ministers, with little
experience in economic policy, and are politi cally unknown outside a small
circle in Mexico City.
Mr Zedillo is perhaps the narrow front-runner from this group. A former
central bank official and budget minister, Mr Salinas could entrust him with
economic policy. He is close to Mr Jose Cordoba, Mr Salinas's powerful chief
of staff, and has learnt to work within the PRI.
But Mr Zedillo has been widely criticised for his poor management of the
Colosio campaign, and for political errors made when education minister.
With the possibility of further political turmoil ahead, his nomination
would involve risks.
Mexico's accession to the North American Free Agreement and the creation of
an independent central bank this year have reduced the president's room for
manoeuvre in economic policy. But whoever is elected will still yield
enormous power. The president dominates the executive branch, the judiciary,
the Congress and has broad power to set government policy in almost all
fields.
The return of uncertainty over who will take office next year could not have
come at a worse time for the governing party. Mexico's economy has been
stagnant for the past year, posting negative growth for the last two
quarters. The government has been trying to revive the economy before the
August elections by increasing spending and lowering interest rates.
Such a policy has already led to a substantial weakening of the peso against
the dollar and recent outflows of foreign money. Mr Colosio's assassination
and accompanying nervousness in financial markets may force the government
to choose between further devaluation or higher interest rates that could
choke economic recovery.
The economic woes are accompanied by a highly volatile political mix. The
uprising in Chiapas is proving harder to resolve than the government had
hoped. It reached a provisional agreement with rebels last month, but
landlords and rebel sympathisers have been caught in a bitter struggle over
land and political power in the state.
On Wednesday the Congress approved an historic political reform, which for
the first time in 50 years would put the electoral institute, which judges
the legitimacy of elections, in the hands of non-partisan citizens. However,
Mr Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the presidential candidate of the leftist opposition
Democratic Revolutionary party, derided the reforms as insufficient.
In theory the reforms will make it difficult for the PRI to revert to fraud
to win the election. Apart from giving the non-partisan officials control
over electoral tribunals, it makes the parties' access to the media more
equal, puts tight limits on campaign spending, and establishes a prosecutor
for electoral fraud.
Mr Cardenas's dissent raises the prospect of post-election protests if he
claims there has been fraud. 'Cuauhtemoc Cardenas is distancing himself from
the reform because he does not trust the government,' said Mr Ricardo
Pascoe, a close adviser. 'He will not give up his right to veto the
elections if they are not fair.'
The PRI's replacement for Mr Colosio will have to grapple with a potentially
aggressive Mr Cardenas, the implementation of the political reforms, and at
the same time reassure financial markets of his ability to run the economy
for six years. It will not be an easy task.

FT  25 MAR 94 / Mexican Crisis: Affable leader short of political vision
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio was an affable, courteous pro-marketeer who rose to
prominence under the patronage of Mr Carlos Salinas, Mexico's current
president.
Former congressman, senator, head of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary
Party, social development minister and finally his party's presidential
candidate, Mr Colosio began his rise through the ranks of the Mexican
bureaucracy in 1979, when he first met Mr Salinas, then deputy budget
minister. Mr Salinas took him under his wing and, after working together for
many years, picked him to run his presidential campaign in 1988. From then
Mr Salinas seemed to groom his quiet and loyal colleague to succeed him.
Mr Colosio was put in charge of the PRI, masterminding the party's
comfortable victory in the 1991 legislative elections. However, he failed to
push through promised democratic reforms that would have required candidates
to be selected in open primaries.
When made social development minister in 1992, Mr Colosio had become clear
favourite for the presidential nomination. He shared Mr Salinas's commitment
to pro-market economic policy, was popular within the ruling party, and
became closely identified with the government's showcase anti-poverty
programme.
It was thought his easy-going manner and modest northern roots would go down
well with the electorate.
Nevertheless, Mr Colosio was criticised by rivals for having no clear vision
independent of Mr Salinas, and for being unwilling or unable to defend a
point of view in cabinet meetings. They said he had been chosen as
presidential candidate because of blind loyalty to Mr Salinas, rather than
any special leadership qualities of his own.
Such doubts grew after Mr Colosio was nominated presidential candidate. His
campaign was quickly overshadowed by the peasant uprising in Chiapas, and
the prominent role played in it by Mr Manuel Camacho, the peace envoy to the
southern state.
In the past few weeks Mr Colosio began the difficult task of distancing
himself from Mr Salinas, even criticising the excessive concentration of
presidential power.
Mr Colosio, still young at 44, was unfailingly polite and courteous in
public, and inspired tremendous loyalty from his advisers and friends.
By the standards of Mexican politicians, he was modest, driving his own car
the city, and occasionally a Harley-Davidson motorcycle. But in unfamiliar
situations he often appeared unsure of himself, and seemed happier listening
rather than talking to people.

FT  25 MAR 94 / Mexican Crisis: Clinton offers help to stabilise currency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US yesterday offered to help Mexico stabilise its currency should it
prove necessary following the assassination of Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio,
which President Bill Clinton deplored as 'a senseless act of violence'.
Mr Clinton telephoned President Carlos Salinas shortly after the news
reached Washington. In a statement yesterday, he emphasised his convictions
that Mexican institutions were 'fundamentally sound'.
He said he had asked Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the treasury secretary, to 'make sure
that if there was serious trading in the Mexican currency we could try to
help stabilise that'. The US Federal Reserve and the Mexican central bank
have arrangements to combat wild swings in the exchange rate.
In a further gesture of solidarity, Ms Janet Reno, the attorney-general,
offered 'any support that we can give' to Mexican authorities investigating
the assassination.
Mr Arturo Valenzuela, Mexican desk officer at the State Department,
reflected the sense of shock in Washington by saying the assassination was
'a significant tragedy'.
'It is not something we should think in any way affects the stability of the
Mexican political system, the Mexican government or the deepening
relationship of the US and Mexico,' he said.
Officials found it hard to see how the tragedy could affect the North
American Free Trade Agreement that came into force at the start of the year.
US opponents of Nafta, ratified by Congress after heated debate last
November, had been critical of the democratic credentials and stability of
the Mexican government.
But unless it emerges that Mr Colosio's assassin or assassins were agents of
elements in the Mexican ruling party, the re-opening of Nafta seems highly
improbable.
There was no immediate word in Washington of any US preference for a
presidential candidate to succeed Mr Colosio. Most of the senior members of
the PRI hierarchy are well known and respected in the US and Mr Colosio had
been seen in the US as the logical successor to Mr Salinas.

FT  25 MAR 94 / Mexican Crisis: Camacho rules himself out of presidential
race, again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Manuel Camacho, the peace envoy in the rebellious state of Chiapas,
yesterday took himself out of the presidential race - yet again.
A former mayor of Mexico City, and foreign minister, Mr Camacho had been
tipped as a possible candidate of the ruling party to replace Mr Colosio.
But in a brief statement Mr Camacho said: 'Two days ago I said I was not
looking to be president of the republic. After the events of this lamentable
crime I reiterate that I do not aspire to the presidency.'
Mr Camacho has held three cabinet positions over eight years, and is one of
the best known politicians in the country. As peace envoy in the state of
Chiapas, he successfully negotiated a preliminary agreement with rebels that
won him national popularity.
Mr Camacho's announcement was the second time this week he has had to rule
himself out of presidential contention. On Tuesday Mr Camacho made a similar
declaration after speculation over a potential presidential bid from the
opposition had caused the stock market and peso to weaken and appeared to be
complicating his peace efforts in the state of Chiapas.
Mr Camacho said he took the decision for the unity of the country. Mr
Camacho has made a large number of enemies in the ruling party during his
career, and his recent flirtation with an independent candidacy alienated
him from the mainstream of the Institutional Revolutionary party, and
especially supporters of Mr Colosio.
Even if President Salinas had wanted to nominate Mr Camacho, his candidacy
could have split the ruling party. Given Mr Camacho's poor relations with Mr
Colosio, it may have been seen as a betrayal to the spirit of the late
presidential candidate.
Apart from being opposed by many in the ruling party, Mr Camacho is also,
perhaps unfairly, mistrusted by many in the foreign and domestic investment
community.
His critics in the government say he opposed some of the economic reforms
proposed by President Salinas. While Mr Camacho recently publicly committed
himself to responsible fiscal and monetary policy, this did not fully allay
suspicions in the market place.
Mr Camacho may seek to play a central role in restoring political order to
Mexico after the assassination of Mr Colosio. Of all members of the PRI, he
has the best relations with the opposition, and enjoys their trust. It is
expected that he will use his powers of persuasion to try and make the
electoral process up to August as smooth and as trouble-free as possible.
In the meantime Mr Camacho will seek to solve the conflict in Chiapas. It is
not clear how the Zapatista rebels in Chiapas will react to the
assassination of Mr Colosio, but the public outcry against violence will
likely put considerable moral pressure on them and their opponents in
Chiapas to settle their differences quickly.

FT  25 MAR 94 / Mexican Crisis: Mexico's violence claims a rare victim from
politics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio was shot as he was leaving a campaign rally in the
sprawling city of Tijuana, the fourth largest in Mexico, just over the
border from San Diego.
He was Mexico's first presidential candidate to be assassinated since
President-elect Alvara Obregon was murdered in 1928. Since then Mexico had
enjoyed remarkable political stability, with every president having lived
out his term, peacefully handing power over to his successor.
Inevitably there was speculation that the assassination, coming so soon
after the New Year's peasant uprising in the state of Chiapas, had been
planned by groups that were set on damaging the Mexican government, or
seeking to replace Mr Colosio with a presidential candidate more favourable
to their interests.
As of yesterday there was no evidence of any conspiracy. Police in Tijuana
arrested Mario Aburto Martinez for the killing. Mr Aburto, 23, an industrial
mechanic, had been grabbed by eyewitnesses and dragged to the nearest police
station. Police have not linked Mr Aburto to any group.
The Attorney-General's office said Mr Aburto confessed to the killing in the
presence of local lawyers, and to buying the pistol several weeks ago with
the purpose of assassinating Mr Colosio. It said it had forensic proof Mr
Aburto had shot twice from a .38 pistol. Police investigations were
continuing. According to the Attorney-General's Office, Mr Aburto said he
was a pacifist, and claimed to have written several books.
The police also detained a second man, Vicente Mayoral, although it appeared
he was just a witness to the shooting.
Given the widespread violence in Mexico, and the few security precautions
politicians take, it was remarkable that so long had passed without such a
political assassination. In 1990 Mexico suffered 30.7 murders per 100,000
people, more than Brazil, and compared with 13.3 in the US.
Last year drug traffickers accidentally killed Cardinal Juan Jesus Posadas
of Guadalajara in a shoot-out with a rival gang, according to the official
explanation. Last week an unknown group of men kidnapped Mr Alfredo Harp
Helu, co-head of Banamex, Mexico's largest bank.
Tijuana, a city whose population, thanks to migration and economic
integration with the US, has nearly tripled in 20 years to an official
900,000, is one of Mexico's most violent cities. Long known for its sleazy
bars and nightclubs, it has more recently become a centre for drug
traffickers, and home to thousands of factories, and the shanty towns that
surround them.
Mr Colosio was on the edge of one of the shanty town when giving his last
speech. Like all Mexican politicians he though nothing of mingling with the
crowd after giving his speech. That will now change.

FT  25 MAR 94 / Mexican Crisis: Economy is vulnerable to unrest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The size of Mexico's current account deficit, put last year at more than
Dollars 20bn (Pounds 13.6bn), has left it highly dependent on capital
inflows from foreign investors.
Thus the assassination of Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio presages a period of
uncertainty for Mexico's financial markets which could have important
consequences for the country's economy.
With the passage in November of the North American Free Trade Agreement with
the US and Canada and its coming into force at the start of this year, many
foreign investors had expected to avoid the financial uncertainty which is
usual in Mexico during an election year.
However, this optimistic outlook was shaken by the unexpected peasant
uprising in the southern state of Chiapas, which started on New Year's Day,
and by the uncertainty that it generated in the Mexican political system.
Mr Colosio's murder has dealt a further blow to this confidence, and though
Mexico's own markets were closed yesterday - in an attempt to reduce
financial market volatility - the prices of Mexican assets dropped sharply
in New York.
The Mexican economic programme sponsored by Mr Carlos Salinas and Mr Pedro
Aspe, his finance minister, was built on fiscal rectitude, a dramatic
privatisation programme and a guarantee of economic stability ostensibly
offered by Nafta.
Critics have seen its weakness in its dependence on foreign capital - to
support big current account deficits - and the policy of a strong exchange
rate to try to squeeze inflation out of the system. Furthermore, while
inflation was brought down to single digits by the end of last year, growth
also sunk to zero.
'They have tried to force a double-digit economy to have single-digit
inflation,' argued Mr Paul Luke, chief emerging markets researcher at Morgan
Grenfell in London.
Joining Nafta this year was widely expected to allow the country to become a
member of the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development, the
so-called rich man's club of industrialised nations. It was also expected to
presage its upgrading by the main US rating agencies as an investment grade
credit, significantly widening the potential investor base for Mexican
bonds.
'A country that appeared on the verge of investment grade and joining the
OECD suffers its first political assassination since the ruling party took
over in 1929. It's clear that the political agenda is longer than the
markets thought,' said Mr Luke.
The only US rating agency to assign an investment grade rating to Mexico's
sovereign debt - Duff &amp; Phelps - said yesterday that while volatility in
Mexican financial markets could be expected in the aftermath of the
assassination, Mexico's stable political institutions and fundamental good
economic management justified the retention of its rating.
Financial markets were indeed volatile. The price of Mexican shares trading
in international markets was marked down by 10 per cent in London trading,
while the price of the country's Brady bonds - issued as part of its last
restructuring - also fell sharply.
But there was some recovery of shares in later New York trading. According
to Mr Geoffrey Dennis of Bear Stearns in New York, Mexican issues traded in
the US were 2-7 per cent down at mid-session yesterday.
Mr John Purcell, head of emerging market research at Salomon Brothers, said
the market in New York appeared to be calming as the day progressed, helped
by statements from President Bill Clinton and widespread confidence in the
ability of the Mexican administration to deal with the crisis, he said.
There would be some nervousness today as the markets reopened in Mexico,
however.
The Mexican peso also weakened but, in the absence of the Mexico City
market, trading was thin and quotes hard to get. Mr Dennis said he believed
the peso would trade close to its floor of 3.36 to the dollar today, making
some intervention by the Mexican central bank necessary to keep it within
its permitted band. 'I think the peso may test its floor, but I expect it
will stay within the band,' said Mr Lawrence Brainard of Goldman Sachs in
New York.
Mexican reserves were last reported at Dollars 29bn, giving some confidence
that even a sustained attack on the peso could be withstood. The US has
pledged to provide support for the peso if necessary.
Mexican interest rates were also expected to rise to defend the currency,
although if they stayed too high too long, this would conflict with the
government's other imperative of trying to revive the weak economy.
A quick announcement of the replacement candidate - most financial market
observers appeared to favour the nomination of former budget minister, Mr
Ernesto Zedillo - would also benefit stability.

FT  25 MAR 94 / Algeria's 'too much blood, too many tears': A look at the
escalating violence that has claimed nearly 4,000 lives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES and AGENCIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Algerian government began a new round of talks with opposition leaders
this week to seek an end to Islamic fundamentalist violence that has killed
nearly 4,000 people in two years.
A day after two more Frenchmen were killed, bringing the number of
foreigners murdered to 31, Spain joined France in urging its nationals to
flee the country.
Violence against foreigners is aimed at scaring away international capital
and know-how vital to Algeria's economy, but Algerians themselves are dying
daily in this two-year-old fight by Islamic militants to topple the
army-backed government that cancelled elections in January 1992.
President Liamine Zeroual, who called last week for talks 'without
exclusion', met members of the Movement for Democracy in Algeria led by
former president Ahmed Ben Bella on Wednesday night, officials said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
The discussion was described as 'positive', but there was no elaboration.
President Zeroual's call, however, is yet to be heeded by any leading
fundamentalist groups. The Islamic Salvation Front, which seemed set to win
the elections because of voter anger with high unemployment, corruption and
government mismanagement, has been banned and its leaders imprisoned.
Meanwhile President Zeroual, who also holds the defence portfolio, has
bolstered the authority of the chief of staff, General Mohamed Lamari, who
is a believer in 'eradicating' the supporters of radical political Islam and
has been at the forefront of the repression against such groups since last
summer.
After a campaign of assassinations of servants of the state - policemen,
soldiers, judges and mayors - militants have turned to killing doctors,
writers, sociologists and journalists in their struggle to turn Algeria into
a country ruled by strict Islamic Sharia law. They have also taken to
killing women who refuse to wear the veil.
Anger at the government's inability to stem the terrorism and opposition to
'any form of dialogue with the fundamentalists' brought 50,000 demonstrators
out on to the streets of Algiers, and thousands more in five other centres
around the country on Tuesday this week.
The march was led by the widow of the director of the Fine Arts School of
Algiers, Mr Abdellah Asselah, who was shot in the head by members of the
most radical Islamic group, the Islamic Armed Group (GIA), two weeks ago in
Algiers. His son, Rabah, 22, a student at the school was wounded and died
shortly afterwards.
'Too much blood, too many tears, together we save Algeria,' protesters
chanted. 'Women have dignity and won't accept shame.'
In an 'open letter' to President Zeroual, the women's groups said that they
'reject exile, submission and compromise'.
The marchers threatened to organise themselves into self-defence groups and
demanded that the army give them weapons to defend themselves. Marches also
took place in Oran, Annaba, Constantine, Bejaia and Tizi Ouzou.
Intellectuals have been caught up in the confrontation between a
nomenklatura which has held power and privilege for 30 years and the radical
Islamists who say in their tracts that 'those who criticise us with their
pen will die by the sword'.
Mr Said Allah Djaafar (the sword of God), one of the leaders of the GIA,
recently told a magazine, that intellectuals were 'apostates' who deserve
the same fate as 'Jews, Christians and foreigners who are part of a colonial
plot to commit profanities on our country. If they are liquidated, that will
destabilise the impious Algerian regime and help return the country to the
reign of Islam as defined by the prophet Mohamed'.
The GIA's most prominent victim in recent weeks was Mr Mohamed Alloula, the
53-year-old playwright and theatre director. He enjoyed popular success with
one recent play, Ladjouad (the Veil). In 1969, at the height of Colonel
Boumediene's dictatorship, El Aleq (The Bloodsuckers), was a powerful satire
of the country's all-pervasive bureaucracy.
Last year a psychiatrist, Professor Mahfoud Boucebci, was warned against
interpreting people's dreams by militants who claimed the Koran was the only
source of truth. He spoke out against those whose aim was 'to destroy
science in the name of Islam'. He was murdered last June.
The knives used in these murders are redolent of sacrificial acts: 'honour'
can only be washed with blood, 'witnesses' must be present at the
'sacrifice'.
Friends of the writer Mr Tahar Djaout, who was murdered last June, and of Mr
Alloula believe that in both instances a contract was put out to kill them.
Contract jobs of this kind are increasingly frequent, usually carried out by
young people. In some instances, they have been drugged before.
Recently, women have been targeted in acts of apparently random violence -
usually raped, often murdered. Last month, a school girl of 17 was murdered
as she was leaving school at Mefta, near Blida, south of Algiers. She had
refused to wear a veil.
Two foreign wives of Algerian citizens have been murdered recently - that
they had converted to Islam was deemed of little consequence.

<TEXT>
Conditions for a Japanese recovery are falling into place, but considerable
adjustments are still needed, Mr Yasushi Mieno, governor of the central
bank, said yesterday.
Mr Mieno, the latest of several senior officials to suggest Japan's worst
post-war recession has reached its trough, said private consumption was
improving and industrial output was expected to recover in the first quarter
of this year, breaking a 28-month decline.
Many private-sector economists believe the economy touched bottom in the
final quarter of last year, when gross domestic product fell 2.2 per cent
compared with the same period in 1992. Government forecasters are more
cautious, saying an improvement early last year only proved to herald a
double-dip recession.
Mr Mieno warned that encouraging statistics, such as an upturn in business
confidence, might be merely seasonal and heavy industrial overcapacity would
slow growth for some time. Continuing labour market weakness, highlighted by
yesterday's low wage offers, was another dampener on demand, he said.

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Leading Japanese labour unions representing steel, shipbuilding and car
workers yesterday agreed to the lowest wage increases seen since 1987 in one
of the most fractious spring wage offensives in recent years.
The Japanese Electrical, Electronic and Information Union, representing
workers at groups such as Matsushita and Toshiba, warned of industrial
action after management refused to better a 3 per cent wage offer for the
year beginning April. The union is seeking a 3.2 per cent rise, lower than
last year's 3.6 per cent.
Private railway workers were late yesterday poised to go on a 24-hour strike
beginning this morning. The railway unions are sticking to their demand of a
Y12,000 (Pounds 76) a month increase, against an offer of Y10,000.
The pay increases agreed yesterday by the steel, shipbuilding and car
industries were among the lowest since the spring wage offensive, known as
Shunto, was first launched 40 years ago.
The round coincides with the fourth year of decline in the Japanese economy
and a call by business organisations for a general pay freeze.
Yesterday's agreements will set the tone for wage talks in other sectors,
giving rise to concerns that the low agreements will put a further dampener
on consumer sentiment. Steel workers settled for a 1.56 per cent increase,
significantly lower than the 2.65 per cent won last year.
In the car sector, Toyota settled for 3.06 per cent, against a 3.2 per cent
demand. Honda set its offer at Y300 below Toyota's; Nissan offered Y800
below Toyota. Shipbuilding and heavy industry workers won a 3.32 per cent
increase (4.27 per cent in 1993).

</HEADLINE>

   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Australia's prime minister, Mr Paul Keating, was yesterday expected to
appoint Ms Carmen Lawrence, the former West Australian premier, to the post
of health minister as part of the fourth ministerial reshuffle in as many
months.
The portfolio was vacated yesterday by Senator Graham Richardson, one of the
Labor Party's most influential powerbrokers, who resigned from the cabinet
with a view to leaving politics.
 -Senator Richardson claimed he had already decided to quit after Labor's
win in the 1993 election, although he had originally planned to step down in
August 1994.
After spending half his adult life in parliament, the senator said he wanted
to pursue other interests, beginning with his memoirs. Speculation suggests
he is planning to work for Mr Kerry Packer, or he would seek to become chief
executive of the Sydney Olympics Games Organising Committee.
For much of the past 10 years, he has been viewed as the key 'numbers man'
in the federal Labor Party, effectively making and breaking prime ministers.
Mr Keating's ascendancy tended to undermine Senator Richardson's power base,
and the two men recently clashed in public over possible changes to the
Medicare levy. But the prime minister and the senator insisted they were on
friendly terms.
Senator Richardson is the fourth senior minister to depart in as many
months, and the 15th since Mr Keating took over from Mr Hawke in 1991. There
has been no pattern to the departures: Mr John Dawkins left the treasurer's
position for personal reasons, Ms Ros Kelly and Mr Alan Griffiths left after
differing controversies.
To an extent, the impact of the latest departure has been offset by the
publicity surrounding Ms Lawrence's arrival in Canberra. Labor Party members
agreed last night she should be given one of the three ministerial positions
now vacant, the others going to Mr Gary Punch and Mr Con Sciacca.

<TEXT>
Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa said yesterday that his country
was ready to support UN sanctions against North Korea if the need arose.
In a meeting with South Korean President Kim Young-sam in Tokyo, Mr Hosokawa
advised, however, that the UN Security Council should proceed cautiously on
the nuclear inspection dispute with North Korea and attempt to maintain
dialogue with Pyongyang.
If the dispute escalated to a point that sanctions would be imposed, Japan
would implement all measures that are permitted by the Japanese
constitution, he said.
But that condition left open the possibility that Japan might refuse on
constitutional grounds to stop the flow of funds to North Korea from
pro-Northern Korean-Japanese.
The funds, which are estimated to amount to Dollars 600m (Pounds 410m) to
Dollars 1.6bn (Pounds 1.1bn) annually, are regarded as a vital source of
foreign revenue for North Korea, which uses the money to pay for necessary
oil and food supplies.
Mr Kim arrived in Tokyo yesterday for a three-day visit before going to
China, where he will ask Beijing to intervene with North Korea and convince
it of the need to accept international inspections.
Meanwhile, Japanese Emperor Akihito last night expressed a 'sense of deep
sorrow' about his country's harsh colonial rule of Korea between 1910 and
1945. Seoul's resentment over Japanese rule has been an obstacle in
relations between the two countries.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Nelson Mandela, president of the African National Congress, yesterday
called for military action to help resolve the crisis in Natal province,
where more than 80 people have died since the weekend in election-related
violence.
Mr Mandela declined to give details of his proposal for military action,
which he discussed yesterday afternoon with President F W de Klerk. Mr
Mandela said political measures should be taken but added 'they must be
co-ordinated with measures as far as the military situation is concerned.'
It appeared last night that the two men had failed to agree on the details
of such action.
Mr de Klerk said after the meeting that 'contingency plans' had been
prepared to increase the security force deployment in Natal. But he said he
wanted to meet Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, the chief minister of KwaZulu
black homeland and leader of the Inkatha Freedom Party, as soon as possible
to seek a political solution to the crisis.
'The government is prepared, willing and able to ensure that law and order
will be effectively maintained. Natal is a very difficult province to police
. . . We will be here in greater numbers in the days and weeks to come to
deal with the volatile and explosive situation here,' Mr de Klerk said.
Military intervention in Natal could dramatically escalate violence in the
region, where several thousand KwaZulu civil servants, yesterday marched in
protest at the threat of military action. Some 6,000 civil servants marched
through the KwaZulu capital Ulundi to demonstrate support for Chief
Buthelezi.
They were responding to statements from ANC leaders on Wednesday calling on
the multiparty Transitional Executive Council to take over the
administration of KwaZulu. Mr de Klerk said last night that the TEC did not
have the power to remove Chief Buthelezi. The ANC will today hold an
anti-Buthelezi civil servants' protest in the Natal town of Empangeni and a
large march through Durban.
Meanwhile, ANC leader Nelson Mandela invited Zulu King Goodwill Zwelethini
to meet him at the home of a prominent Natal businessman to discuss the
future of KwaZulu. He said the ANC was committed to the idea that 'his
majesty takes his legitimate place in the new South Africa as the rightful
monarch of the Zulu people.'
However, Mr Mandela laid down a condition for the meeting - that it be
private - which may be rejected by the king. The two men were to have met
last week in Ulundi, but Mr Mandela cancelled the meeting after Chief
Buthelezi invited thousands of the king's supporters to attend. ANC
officials said they feared for Mr Mandela's safety at the meeting.

FT  25 MAR 94 / Somalia's clans tire of war: A look at the prospects for a
fragile peace accord
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Somalia's arch-rivals, Gen Mohamed Farah Aideed and Mr Ali Mahdi Mohamed,
embraced yesterday in Nairobi and pledged to form a government of national
reconciliation only hours before the last US troops were due to pull out of
Somalia.
The two warlords, promoted to 'faction leaders' by a more conciliatory
United Nations, signed an agreement which commits them to implementing a
ceasefire, disarming their militias, and holding a conference on May 15 to
elect a president, vice-presidents and a prime minister for their war-torn
country.
Somalia has not had a government since Gen Mohamed Siad Barre was overthrown
in January 1991 and rival clans plunged the country into civil war.
Details of the new agreement were sketchy. The short declaration did not
explain how power would be shared among the 15 clans and numerous sub-clans
who have fought so bitterly for hegemony over the past three years.
Somaliland, the former British colony which straddles the north-west of the
country, has unilaterally declared independence and did not take part in the
Nairobi talks.
Gen Aideed and Mr Ali Mahdi have embraced before, only to resume fighting
across the green line that divides Mogadishu. Two previous peace agreements
have collapsed.
But all sides were keen to put a positive gloss on yesterday's proceedings.
Mr Ali Mahdi spoke of 'a new determination in Somalia. . . to deal with
conflict peacefully and collectively'.
Ambassador Lansana Kouyate of Guinea, who brokered the peace talks on behalf
of the UN, said the present agreement had a greater chance of success
because 'the Somali people and their leaders are tired of war'.
The new climate of understanding rests on fragile ground. On Wednesday
night, Mr Kouyate announced the peace talks had collapsed, after Somali
factions called off their reconciliation ceremony for the third time in a
week. Yesterday, he cautioned the new agreement was 'only a beginning'.
Mr Kouyate leaned heavily on the factions to reach some kind of public
understanding before the departure of US troops, which many feared would
bring back anarchy and violence to Somalia. The agreement, however cosmetic,
will buy the UN time in which to readjust its operation in Somalia in the
face of its rapidly crumbling military presence there.
The withdrawal of the 28,000-strong US force and all the European
contingents has turned a multinational UN peacekeeping force into a Third
World operation with uncertain aims. Pakistan, with the largest contingent
in Somalia, is threatening to withdraw its 5,300 soldiers unless the UN
provides better military hardware. 'Are the lives of Pakistanis cheaper, or
is our job to be completed less effectively?' asked Mr Sardar Aseef, the
foreign minister, during an inspection tour this month.
The complaint masks the impotence of the peacekeepers who remain. Mogadishu
airport is looking bereft without the display of heavy weaponry that marked
the 15-month stay of US troops. Aid agencies say looting and banditry are on
the rise. On Sunday, two Italian journalists were shot dead in Mogadishu.
Seven aid workers have been kidnapped since January.
But UN soldiers have avoided any action that might bring them into conflict
with lawless gunmen ever since a battle in October which killed 18 US
soldiers. 'A bunker mentality pervades the fortified UN compound in
Mogadishu,' says Mr Richard Burge of the British charity Save the Children
Fund (SCF). 'Having an international force in Somalia has only given us a
false sense of security.'
When an SCF warehouse came under attack from looters in Belet Wein last
month, Italian peacekeepers stationed in the town failed to come to the
rescue. 'They just switched off their radio,' Mr Burge said.
Few aid workers believe clan leaders can regain control of their gunmen.
'Real disarmament will be a task for the new government,' Gen Aideed said
yesterday. So will the creation of a police force, an independent judiciary,
and all the civil institutions which Gen Aideed and other warlords so
effectively destroyed. For the moment, at least, it appears Somalia's
fractious clans have more to gain from talking than from fighting.

FT  25 MAR 94 / Hamas deaths spark protests by Palestinians

Clashes erupted in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip yesterday, as
Palestinians took to the streets to protest against Wednesday's killing of
four leading members of the Hamas Islamic movement's military wing.
Palestinian sources said dozens of Palestinians were injured; the Israeli
army said three soldiers and three Israeli civilians were hurt. In the
Hebron area, Palestinian sources said Jewish settlers fired guns and threw
stones at several homes. Palestinians responded by stoning the settlers. And
when the army arrived, soldiers fired tear gas to disperse the Palestinians.
About 120,000 Palestinians in the Hebron area have been under strict curfew
for a month, since Jewish settler Baruch Goldstein massacred 30 Arab
worshippers inside the Cave of the Patriarchs. Only the 400 or so Jewish
settlers in the town are allowed to move around freely.
The Israeli army commander responsible for the Hebron area, General Danny
Yatom, claimed yesterday that the Hamas militants killed in Hebron were
believed to include extremists responsible for the murders of several
Israelis. However, since the building where they had been hiding out was
devastated it was proving difficult to identify the bodies.
The PLO yesterday urged rich nations to give more money to support setting
up a Palestinian police force in the self-rule areas of Gaza and Jericho,
Reuter adds.
'What has been pledged so far is not enough. We need more,' said Mr Nabil
Shaath, chief PLO negotiator, after Israeli and PLO delegations met
representatives of 20 donor countries in Cairo.
He quoted World Bank figures estimating start up costs of Dollars 47m and
annual costs of Dollars 90m for a Palestinian police force in Gaza and
Jericho, designated as self-rule areas under an accord signed last year by
Israel and the PLO.

<TEXT>
A leaked letter of intent sent by the South African government to the
International Monetary Fund last year threatens to embarrass the African
National Congress.
The ANC put its name to a document committing a new government to fiscal and
monetary discipline as a precondition for securing a five-year Dollars 850m
(Pounds 574m) loan for drought relief.
Mr Alec Erwin, a leading ANC parliamentary candidate, this week argued
against rigid deficit ceilings, in favour of greater flexibility.
But Mr Tito Mboweni, the ANC's representative on the Transitional Executive
Council's finance committee, said it regarded the IMF letter of intent as
'binding'.
The letter, signed by the TEC, the multiparty body overseeing government,
recognises the importance of tight monetary policy, and states that
'increases in government deficit would jeopardise the economic future of the
country'.

FT  25 MAR 94 / Development aid goals must be 'rethought'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN and JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Donors and beneficiary countries must rethink development goals in the light
of radical changes in the world order, according to the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development's development assistance committee.
Events since the collapse of the Berlin wall in 1989, including the Mideast
peace initiative and the end of apartheid in South Africa, and new demands
from eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, made it 'imperative' that
aid be used more efficiently.
This should be done 'essentially through implementing agreed aid principles
and practices', the committee says in its annual report published today.
Aggregate official development assistance (ODA) from the committee's members
increased 6.6 per cent in 1992 in nominal terms to Dollars 60.4bn (Pounds
40.3bn), a 0.5 per cent rise in real terms. Twelve of the 21 member
countries increased the volume of their aid, including Sweden, Denmark, and
Norway. With the Netherlands, these countries were at or above the UN target
of setting aid spending at 0.7 per cent of GNP.
The group of eight countries whose official aid-to-GNP ratio was below the
average 0.33 per cent in 1992 includes the US, Japan and the UK. Between
them, these countries provide almost 50 per cent of member countries'
official aid budget.
Foreign direct investment in developing countries, at Dollars 24bn in 1992,
was on par with 1991 levels, the bulk of which went to large economies
including China, India and Indonesia. Net private flows to the poorest
countries and to sub-Saharan Africa were negative in 1992.
Total net resource flows to developing countries (measured in terms of 1991
constant prices and exchange rates) increased Dollars 28bn in 1992 to a
record Dollars 159bn, mainly due to private flows.
The debt situation of developing countries as a whole continued to improve.
The stock of debt, which rose 4 per cent in current terms in 1992 to Dollars
1,542bn, is growing at a 'slower, more serviceable pace'. The debt of some
of the poorest developing countries, many in sub-Saharan Africa, 'continues
to be a major burden for development efforts'. The ratio of debt stock to
GNP for developing countries as a whole was about 37 per cent in 1992 (109
per cent for sub-Saharan Africa).
The OECD annual aid and development review is to be followed within the next
month by a country report focused on the UK.
Publication is likely to refuel the controversy within the UK over the
funding of the Malaysian Pergau dam project.
Ms Anna-Liisa Korhonen, a Finnish government official who conducted the UK
review for the OECD, said her report did not intend to single out individual
projects for criticism. But it is understood the report will reflect OECD
concern over aid resources when defence and commercial interests may
influence government decisions.

agenda
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A US attempt to put worker rights on the negotiating agenda of the new World
Trade Organisation was rebuffed by trading partners yesterday.
Trade negotiators rejected a demand for a reference to the link between
labour standards and trade to go into the political declaration being
drafted for ministers to endorse when they meet next month in Marrakesh to
sign the Uruguay Round trade liberalising accords. 'The US had no support at
all,' said one trade official at the talks.
While the European Union in principle favours a discussion of the worker
rights issue, it did not back the US in requesting specific language in the
draft ministerial declaration.
In any event, this could never have won the support of developing countries,
especially in Asia, which are strongly opposed to labour and human rights
appearing on the trade agenda. They fear that such moves will provide new
pretexts for trade protection in the industrialised world.
Washington must now decide whether to give in and allow an agreed draft
ministerial declaration to go forward without a reference to worker rights,
or stand its ground at the risk of precipitating a row at Marrakesh.
A meeting of the trade negotiations committee, which supervises the
120-nation Uruguay Round, is scheduled for next Wednesday when all the
agreements, decisions and declarations for the Marrakesh meeting are
supposed to be finalised.
Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, said on Wednesday that the
Clinton administration would be seeking some understanding at Marrakesh on
the need for labour standards to be addressed.
'What we are trying to achieve is to tie internationally recognised labour
standards to trade,' he told a House of Representatives commerce
sub-committee.

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association yesterday announced a
voluntary plan to increase access to the Japanese market for foreign
vehicles and parts.
The plan, which follows persistent US pressure on Tokyo to improve the
market environment for foreign vehicle and parts makers, is aimed at
deflecting US criticism of trade barriers to the Japanese market. It is
being offered as an alternative to US requests for government-led action to
open the country's vehicle market.
The plan calls for increased exchanges among vehicle and parts industries
worldwide, support for foreign vehicle makers in Japan and better
availability to foreign companies of information concerning the Japanese
market.
The issue of car and parts sales has been particularly thorny, as the sector
makes up 60 per cent of the US trade deficit with Japan. Japan has been
criticised for providing insufficient information to foreign carmakers and
for regulations and business practices which hinder sales of foreign-made
parts to the Japanese after-market.
Japanese officials have refused to commit themselves to US proposals for
government action in the industry, claiming on the grounds that such
activity in the private sector would constitute managed trade.
The association's plan was timed to precede the government's launch of a
programme to open up the country's markets.

FT  25 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Singapore set to order 52 airliners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Singapore Airlines (SIA) is planning to order up to 52 wide-body airliners
worth more than Pounds 4.1bn to meet expected growth of 8 to 9 per cent a
year over the next 10 years.
The proposed order has sparked a fierce contest between Boeing of the US and
the European Airbus consortium.
Both rivals have submitted proposals to SIA. The three leading aero-engine
manufacturers - Pratt &amp; Whitney and General Electric of the US and
Rolls-Royce of the UK - have also submitted bids to supply engines.
SIA has told the bidders it needs 22 Boeing 747-400 jumbos and 30 Airbus
A340 long-range airliners for delivery starting in 1997 and running through
to 2003.
These orders are in addition to 12 Boeing 747-400s and 13 A340s the airline
already has on option.
Although SIA is considering buying a mix of Boeing and Airbus wide-body
airliners, it has also indicated it could opt for just one aircraft type if
it received a sufficiently attractive proposal.
The separate negotiations over the conversion of SIA's Boeing and Airbus
options are also likely to have an impact on the airline's proposed Dollars
6bn order since the manufacturers can be expected to use these negotiations
to offer an overall package to enhance their chances.
The stakes are big because aircraft orders of this magnitude are rare in the
troubled airline industry. The European Airbus consortium is particularly
anxious to clinch the Singapore deal after losing out to its US rivals in
supplying airliners Saudi Arabia.
SIA is regarded as a prestige customer for the manufacturers because it is
one of the few strongly profitable airlines based in the world's fastest
growing aviation market of the Asia-Pacific region.
The company has never cancelled a firm order.
Although SIA has also been hit by the world airline industry downturn during
the last three years, it has pursued its strategy of maintaining a young
fleet, averaging about five years, by regularly acquiring new aircraft and
selling its older airliners.
The new Dollars 6bn order, expected to be placed in two to three months'
time, reflects SIA's growth strategy which will see the airline doubling in
size during the next 10 years.
SIA has in the past used the proceeds of sales of older aircraft to finance
its continuous fleet renewal and expansion programme. However, the aircraft
resale market has been depressed during the past two years and SIA has been
considering leasing aircraft until the market picks up.

FT  25 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Europe urged to set health goals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Other countries in Europe should follow Britain's example and set specific
targets for the health of their citizens, the Financial Times World
Pharmaceuticals Conference in London was told yesterday.
Mr David Anstice, who heads the European pharmaceutical business of Merck,
the largest US drug company, said governments were obsessed with financial
accountability and neglected their parallel responsibility for improving
health. 'To achieve these improvements, governments should identify
priorities and set measurable national health targets.' The only example so
far, he said, was the 1992 UK White Paper on health, which identified five
priority areas with targets for the year 2000.
If such targets were taken seriously, they would encourage governments to
spend their drugs budgets more wisely, Mr Anstice said. At present they
waste money on cheap but ineffective 'comfort medicines' without patent
protection, when they could get better value by encouraging doctors to
prescribe more effective new drugs.
The pharmaceutical industry has traditionally focused its marketing and
promotional activity on the doctor, rather than the patient.
But the message to the conference from Mr Thomas Moore, president of Procter
&amp; Gamble's US pharmaceutical business, was: 'Don't forget the consumer.'
Mr Moore said most drug companies lacked the marketing skills required to
sustain a profitable long-term income from products which switched from
prescription-only to over-the-counter status.
The normal approach was to milk them for short-term profits rather than
creating brand loyalty.
Mr Kurt Briner, president of France's Sanofi Pharma, agreed that 'in
addition to supporting a growing share of the expense, patients want to have
more say in the choice of drugs prescribed. This attitude is rapidly gaining
momentum.'

FT  25 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Hidden hurdles for Uruguay Round - The
clouds are gathering over next month's Marrakesh meeting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Business Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When ministers from more than 100 countries gather in Marrakesh, Morocco,
next month to sign the Uruguay Round, there is bound to be much
self-congratulation on having achieved the most far-reaching world trade
liberalisation package in history.
However, their festive spirit will be tempered by awareness that the deal
will not be finally in the bag until it has been ratified by their own
legislatures - or at least by most of the economically more important
members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. And on that score, a
number of worrying uncertainties remain.
Negotiators have agreed in principle that the process should be completed in
time for the Round's provisions, including establishment of the planned
World Trade Organisation, to take effect by July 1 next year.
But urged on by the Gatt secretariat, several leading industrialised powers
have indicated that they are aiming for ratification by the end of this
year. Though the deadline is informal, it has started to acquire
considerable psychological importance in Geneva. However, it also looks
increasingly ambitious. While all governments say they are confident of
mustering the necessary legislative backing, there are growing risks that
ratification could be sidetracked in several national capitals by procedural
complications or by political obstacles not directly related to trade
policy.
Serious delays among the 'Quad' powers - the US, the European Union, Japan
and Canada - would defer realisation of the economic benefits of further
trade liberalisation. Equally important, they could check the momentum by
lessening the pressure on other, smaller, countries to ensure speedy
ratification of the Round.
Until recently, the main doubts centred on the prospects for early action by
the US Congress. Not only have these deepened since the start of this year;
but fresh uncertainties have emerged about the outlook in the EU, where an
internal wrangle has arisen over jurisdictional issues, and in Japan, where
parliament is already late with its existing timetable.
In the US, the Clinton administration had originally aimed for congressional
ratification before the summer recess. But the timetable has been jolted by
the need to compensate for revenue losses caused by planned tariff cuts.
The losses have been put at at least Dollars 13.5bn (Pounds 9.2bn) over five
years. Mr Richard Gephardt, leader of the House Democrats, has suggested
they could total Dollars 40bn in the next decade. Under budget rules, the
shortfall must be made good by tax rises or reduced spending.
In Europe, the fate of the Round has been complicated by an arcane
controversy about who is entitled to ratify it on behalf of the EU. The
European Commission, backed by the European parliament, claims it has the
necessary authority. But most member governments disagree. The 12 contend
that while the commission was empowered to negotiate on their behalf, EU law
requires that their own parliaments approve those parts of the package
dealing with the creation of the WTO, liberalisation of services and
intellectual property rights.
In an effort to resolve the row, Brussels plans next month to seek an
opinion from the European Court. The commission claims to be confident of a
decision in its favour which would enable it to ratify the entire agreement
and leave national parliaments to give their assent at their leisure.
However, there are two possible catches. One is that the court is unlikely
to rule before autumn at the earliest. The other is that if its ruling goes
against Brussels, the EU will be unable to ratify the Round until it has
been approved by every national parliament.
The Japanese parliament will be unable to tackle the Uruguay Round during
its current session because of blocking tactics by the Liberal Democratic
party, which has refused to discuss the coming year's budget until prime
minister Morohiro Hosokawa divulges more details about a Y100m (Pounds
637,000) loan from a trucking company.
The package will be submitted to a special parliamentary session in the
autumn, which will also be asked to consider controversial tax reform
proposals and a bill to redraw the country's electoral boundaries. 'It is
going to be a very tight schedule,' says Mr Koro Bessho, director of the
foreign ministry's Gatt division.

trade bloc

<TEXT>
Representatives of 22 countries and several dependent territories in the
Caribbean Basin have concluded the first round of talks aimed at creating a
new regional trade group.
The Association of Caribbean States - its provisional title - will start as
a consultative group linking up to 25 countries as full members and 15
dependent territories as associate members. It could eventually become the
world's fourth largest trade bloc.
The draft convention, discussed in Kingston, will be studied further at a
meeting in the Dominican Republic in May, before being taken up by ministers
in June. Members will sign the agreement in July.
Prospective members of the ACS include Colombia, Mexico, Venezuela, Cuba,
Haiti, the Dominican Republic, the Central American states, Surinam and
members of the Caribbean Community.
According to the draft convention, the group's main objectives will be
liberalising trade and investment; co-ordinating negotiating positions on
bilateral and multilateral issues; and promoting investment opportunities in
the Caribbean Basin.
'We are creating an environment and it is the beginning of the process,'
said Mr Edwin Carrington, secretary general of the Caribbean Community
(Caricom), which is co-ordinating the formation of the ACS. But the 25
countries which had sent representatives to the meetings had the potential
to create the world's fourth biggest trade bloc.
The likely membership of the ACS has a combined population of 200m people,
an estimated gross national product of Dollars 500bn (Pounds 342bn),
estimated annual merchandise exports of Dollars 80bn, and annual merchandise
imports of Dollars 100bn.
There is already some uncertainty over how Cuba will fit into the group.
Some delegates to the Kingston conference said they expected, but would not
be deterred by, US irritation at Cuba's participation, although this could
worry other potential members. Two US Caribbean possessions - Puerto Rico
and the US Virgin Islands - are unlikely to be interested in the group
because of Cuba's participation.

FT  25 MAR 94 / The Italian Election: Italy's voters look set to put new
political alliances to the test - Unpredictable results are likely from an
electoral system with conflicting aims
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM

<TEXT>
For the first time, this Sunday and Monday, a European democracy is electing
a parliament with two totally different voting systems based on opposite
principles of representation.
Italy is introducing British-style first-past-the-post majority voting to
elect 75 per cent of both houses, but has retained proportional
representation for the rest.
This curious hybrid requires considerable sophistication from the electorate
and will produce some unpredictable results with 15 main parties in the
ring. Nevertheless, neither of the two main alliances - the Progressives and
the Freedom Alliance - is likely to win outright.
On the one hand, the majority vote has encouraged the formation of alliances
and the move towards a bi-polar political system. On the other, proportional
representation is designed to both reward and preserve the smaller parties.
While the former system is intended to produce a clear-cut victory of one
party or alliance, the latter militates against a clear result by seeking to
create a group of balancing seats in the hands of small parties, who will
then determine which alliance has a majority.
The inclusion of this proportional balance was a deliberate move by the
Christian Democrats, Socialists and their allies who held the majority in
the outgoing parliament. They believed they would be in the centre
orchestrating the formation of the next government.
These conflicting electoral principles have determined all parties'
strategies. No one could afford to fight the election on its own.
First to realise this was the former communist Party of the Democratic Left
(PDS), which mobilised an alliance of 'progressive' parties to contest local
elections last June and again in November. Back in December the PDS-led
seven-party alliance looked a near certain winner.
Indeed, media magnate Silvio Berlusconi's decision to enter politics in
January was determined largely by other parties' inability to forge
alliances and the consequent fear of the PDS sweeping the board. His choice
of partners was determined by the refusal of the centre parties to entertain
his political ambitions.
This left him no option but to team up his Forza Italia movement with Mr
Umberto Bossi's populist League in the north and Mr Gianfranco Fini's
neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance in the centre and south. Whatever was said
to the contrary in public, both League and MSI were happy to benefit from
the Forza Italia media umbrella and the extra votes Mr Berlusconi promised
to bring from the centre.
The centre was the last to agree an alliance strategy. This was partly the
fault of Mr Mario Segni, the referendum leader and former Christian
Democrat. He flirted with the League and was courted by Mr Berlusconi and by
the PDS. Unable to make up his mind or making unacceptable conditions, he
was left with the Christian Democrats, rebaptised as the Popular Party
(PPI), as the sole prop.
Mr Berlusconi has made an extraordinary impact in a short time. The use of
his media empire to launch him and the exploitation of his Fininvest network
of business interests to organise Forza Italia have played an important
role. But his success is arguably a direct consequence of the collapse of
the credibility of the centre parties which traditionally accounted for over
40 per cent of the vote. His was the most appealing face and the most
reassuring message for middle class Italy worried by political instability
and recession.
Yet, for a man who claims to have at least a quarter of the national vote,
he explained extraordinarily little of his plans to achieve his 'new Italian
miracle'. His strength, and potential weakness, lies in this being a
post-ideological election. Forza Italia is not a political name but
associated with football: it is run on the lines of a supporters' club
backed by the Fininvest managerial expertise. It is built round the core of
Publitalia, Fininvest's advertising arm, and Standa, the stores group, and
its programme looks like a company report. Voters are targeted like
potential buyers. Mr Berlusconi's post-ideological appeal has attracted
League voters in the north disenchanted with Mr Bossi's dogmatic stand on
federalism and his over-confrontational style. Forza Italia could even claim
credit for removing the threat of northern separatism.
The PDS, meanwhile, is presenting itself as a 'respectable' social
democratic party, free of the old communist bogey label. At the other end of
the scale, the MSI has changed its name to National Alliance and claims the
fascist label no longer applies. The new respectability of the MSI
championed by Mr Fini, despite some ugly figures in the background, has
found a large echo and could be one of the big surprises.
The Christian Democrats, whose raison d'etre was the Catholic vote in the
cold war against communism, have dropped their religious identification and
have revived the name of the party's forbear in the twenties, the Popular
party. The church, itself, for the first time, is faced with a split in the
Catholic vote.
In this campaign the principle problems suffered by the alliances have been
related to the old ideological connotations. The PDS has been damaged by the
statements of its Progressive ally, Reconstructed Communism. Calls for
raising taxes on government bonds arouse fears of soaking the rich even
though the party is clearly posturing to its own electorate.
Equally, Mr Berlusconi has given a greater mantle of respectability to Mr
Fini. He accordingly suffers when the old corporatist attitudes of the MSI
surface and clash with the media magnate's professed free market belief. The
MSI/National Alliance colours the Freedom Alliance and forces Mr Berlusconi
more to the right. This suits Mr Fini who is less concerned about entering
the government than playing for the next elections.
Mr Berlusconi insists in public that he would form a government with the
MSI. But the League says it will not be in the same government as the MSI.
Thus it is hard to see the Freedom Alliance in government in its present
form. By the same token, Reconstructed Communism is an uncomfortable partner
in government for the PDS. The party is unacceptable if the Progressives
need to treat with the centre.
As the campaign has matured, the difficulties of either main alliance
forming a government have become more obvious. This has enabled the centre
Pact to present itself as a viable counter-weight and may well attract
voters for this reason. However, it can only pick up seats on the
proportional lists.
Opinion polls have been banned since March 15. But party analysts talk of
the Progressives winning 230-270 seats, the Freedom Alliance 260-300 and the
Pact 40-70. These parameters envisage no outright majority and many
commentators suggest the next government will be an institutional one, even
led by the outgoing premier, Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi. Whoever governs, a
first task will be electoral reform to ensure that Italians can vote for a
clearly identifiable government.

FT  25 MAR 94 / The Italian Election: Voting rules leave public perplexed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The new election laws are in the best tradition of Italian legislation -
complex and confusing.
The Ministry of the Interior has been obliged to run daily television spots
explaining how the voting system works. It has also obligingly published a
544-page booklet on all the electoral laws since 1947.
The impression remains that many people remain perplexed. They certainly do
not understand the finer points of the new system which is split between
majority voting (first-past-the-post) and proportional representation.
Although constituency boundaries have been redrawn for these elections to
accommodate population changes and create smaller electoral colleges, the
number of seats remains the same. The Chamber of Deputies has 630 seats with
roughly 130,000 voters per seat. The Senate has 315 seats with broader
regional constituencies.
Under the new system 475 seats in the chamber are elected by majority voting
and 155 by proportional representation. The same 75/25 per cent split
applies in the Senate.
For the chamber, voters are given two voting slips - the first has
candidates on the majority list, the second candidates on the proportional
list. The majority vote is straightforward: the candidate with the most
votes wins the seat.
The complex part relates to the seats elected by proportional
representation. Before the proportional votes are totalled at national
level, a mechanism is introduced which favours the small parties and
penalises those parties which have already seen their candidates win seats
in the majority vote. This is on the principle that the smaller parties will
win few seats in the majority vote, which favours candidates in big parties
or in alliances controlled by a dominant party.
To qualify for any of the 155 proportional seats, each party must have 4 per
cent of the vote nationally. Two of the traditional minor partners in
government, the Liberals and Social Democrats, have been well below this
threshold since 1987.
The proportional candidates for parliament are selected from party lists,
according to the dictates of the leaders. Candidates can contest one
majority seat, which they must accept if they win or risk losing it to the
runner-up party. However, majority vote candidates can also stand in up to
three proportional lists to hedge their bets.
All the leading candidates in the parties are standing in both the majority
and the proportional lists - often in two or three. For instance, Mr
Gianfranco Fini, the MSI/National Alliance leader, is a majority candidate
in Rome, and a proportional candidate in Lazio and a Trieste constituency.
Mr Achille Occhetto is a majority candidate in Bologna and then a
proportional candidate in Lazio.

FT  25 MAR 94 / The Italian Election: Programmes aplenty but few new ideas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Every party in this campaign has gone through the motions of presenting a
programme.
This in itself is a considerable novelty. Italian parties have never
previously bothered with programmes because it was taken for granted who was
likely to win the elections.
Thus people either voted for the five prospective government parties or the
opposition. In the case of the government vote, the electorate knew there
would be near complete continuity with the policies of the outgoing
coalition. A vote for the opposition was never a credible endorsement of a
programme of government.
However, this time a large number of parties could form part of the next
government. They have been obliged therefore to prepare policy proposals -
but what is on offer bears all the signs of being hastily conceived.
At the same time no one party has come up with original ideas to tackle the
problems of Italy's huge debt stock, rising unemployment and inefficient
administration. Nor, despite appearances, is it a real battle between a free
market right and a statist left.
The Progressive Alliance on the left has come to endorse the market economy
and believes in the Maastricht criteria of convergence. Meanwhile, the
right's Freedom Alliance contains an odd mix of Forza Italia's enterprise
culture and the neo-fascist MSI's long-standing ideas of the corporatist
state.
Economic policy guidelines: The Progressives openly support a continuation
of the present government's internationally approved policy of budget
austerity, bringing inflation below 4 per cent and ensuring the debt stock
as a percentage of gross domestic product peaks in 1996. The centre Italian
Pact follows the same line but says so more discreetly. Forza Italia has
played down austerity for electoral reasons and placed the emphasis on
stimulating a rapid recovery.
Taxes: All parties agree on the need to simplify the jungle of direct and
indirect taxes. The most radical approach is that of Forza Italia which also
favours a 33 per cent single rate of income tax. The main disagreement
between 'left' and 'right' is over the role played by tax incentives. Mr
Berlusconi sees tax breaks as an important stimulant of new investment. The
Progressives are afraid to be seen lowering the tax burden on the rich.
All want to avoid any further increase in fiscal pressure (currently at 42
per cent). The Pact talks of imposing a constitutional limit of 40 per cent;
Forza Italia wants to reduce pressure by one percentage point a year over
the next decade. Both the Northern League and the PDS want to reduce the
excessively centralised tax system and make it more federal with greater
power for the regions.
Jobs: Employment is the electorate's biggest concern and the parties
recognise they have to demonstrate a commitment to create jobs. This raises
the most stark contrast in policies. The left is placing much hope on the
Delors plan for stimulating Europe-wide employment through grand
infrastructure projects. The Progressives also emphasise raising standards
of professional training and channelling investment (public and private)
into areas of high-technology. The right, especially Forza Italia and the
League, believe the key lies in greater flexibility in the labour market,
with easier rules on hiring and firing - coupled with fiscal incentives to
hire personnel.
Social security: There is a contrast between the left and centre's belief in
the value of a revitalised and slimmer welfare state, and the right's pledge
to create more room for private initiative in healthcare and pensions. The
growing deficit in the state-operated pensions scheme has forced all parties
to propose solutions.
Forza Italia and the League want to create the conditions to permit a rapid
shift towards private pension funds. The Progressives believe existing
legislation on pension funds is sufficient and would ensure that the state
continues to guarantee a safety-net for the less fortunate. Almost certainly
the next government will be forced to speed up the gradualist move to raise
the pensionable age to 65.
Privatisation: Save reticence from the MSI and Reconstructed Communists at
opposite ends of the spectrum, the parties endorse a slimming of state
involvement through privatisation. The existing privatisation programme is
likely to be respected. The main differences centre on the timetable and the
residual control of the state in 'strategic' areas like telecommunications
(Telecom Italia) and energy (Eni). Forza Italia wants the process to move
more quickly and the state to withdraw more completely. The centre and left
would respect the Ciampi guidelines but the left will be tempted to retain
some control over telecoms and Eni.
Foreign policy: Italy's commitment to the European Union is supported by the
main parties. The degree of commitment will be determined by the strength
and/or weakness of the next government. All parties are anxious to see Italy
play an active role in resolving the crisis in former Yugoslavia. The right
wants to see a more active overseas military role and is committed to
raising the profile and professionalism of Italy's armed forces. All parties
would be forced by budgetary constraints to cut foreign aid.

FT  25 MAR 94 / The Italian Election: Business ponders which runner to back
 -New political system is causing concern in nation's boardrooms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There seem to be two parallel election campaigns in Italy. One is the
colourful televised spectacle, a parade of new or relaunched parties
inflated by rhetoric and garnished with new slogans and logos. The other is
the attempt by the same protagonists to appear greyer than their rivals, to
shake off or play down potentially embarrassing links with neo-fascism,
Marxism and corruption scandals.
It is this second campaign which Italy's business community is watching.
According to Mr Marco Borsa, editor of the Milan-based business magazine
Espansione, companies are fearful of the future. 'They were used to working
under the old political system.'
That fear is compounded by the fact that it is difficult for the business
community to interpret the signals put out by the three main political
groupings.
As creator of the Fininvest group, Europe's second largest media empire, Mr
Silvio Berlusconi, Forza Italia's founder, ought to have the edge in winning
the entrepreneurial vote. Last Sunday he tried to highlight this strength in
a radio debate with his main Progressive opponent, Mr Achille Occhetto,
leader of the Party of the Democratic Left (PDS).
'In government it's particularly important to have someone concrete, who
knows how to organise things, get results and come up with ideas. This
activity is much closer to my training than that of a party leader, who may
know his party apparatus, and how to handle interviews, party rallies and TV
slots, but has never had to deal with the concrete problems of the
workplace,' he claimed.
But Mr Occhetto has been working hard at home and abroad to offset fears
about the Progressive Alliance, whose ranks include not only the PDS but the
unabashed hard left of Reconstructed Communism, a party which has frightened
investors by threatening to tax government bonds. Last month Mr Occhetto
even spent 24 hours in the City of London, reassuring bankers and brokers
that his was the party of fiscal prudence, continued privatisation and
reform of the public administration.
Mr Berlusconi may also have alienated some of the business constituency with
a colourful attack on the Confindustria employers' federation earlier this
month. He claimed that the federation, of which he is a council member, was
not a place for real entrepreneurs.
As a result, business support could well be split next Sunday. Indeed,
company executives are standing for almost all parties. In Milan, for
example, Mr Ernesto Gismondi, head of the Artemide design group, is a
Progressive candidate in spite of having been a missile expert and Nato
consultant.
Under the circumstances, it is hardly surprising that few companies will
commit themselves publicly to supporting one group of parties.
Confindustria itself eschews political commentary. Instead, the media has
speculated about the voting intentions of Mr Gianni Agnelli, head of Fiat
and a traditional reference point for the industrial mood of Italy. A party
thrown by a Fiat lawyer this week for Mr Valerio Zanone, candidate for the
centrist alliance in Turin, was taken as evidence that the Agnellis were
backing the centre. Gianni himself has made no clear pronouncements.
Certain small businesses, widely courted by prospective candidates,
particularly in the north, are more partisan. Mr Beppe Palma co-ordinates a
Milan-based lobby group for small and medium-sized enterprises which has
pinned its hopes for the past four years on the federalist Northern League.
He admits, however, that politicians can easily commit themselves to helping
small and medium-sized companies, then forget about them once in power.
In any case, according to some entrepreneurs, the final choice may not make
much difference. Mr Luciano Benetton, chairman of the international clothing
group, points out that all parties face the same challenges as the outgoing
technocratic government: reducing unemployment and the public debt,
continuing privatisation and reform.
Behind the electoral hyperbole, the manifestos of the three main groups are
broadly similar.
Mr Panfilo Tarantelli, who heads the Milan office of merchant bank
Schroders, is similarly calm about the effect on markets. 'There is really
nothing in the three programmes which is alarming or would lead to the
conclusion that Italy is becoming a risky country (for investment).'
In an opinion poll at the beginning of this month for the newspaper Corriere
della Sera, institutional investors, fund managers and brokers suggested
that an outright victory for the centrist alliance would probably be the
best result for the bond and stock markets. Unfortunately for investors, a
centrist victory is the least likely outcome. Probably no group will have a
majority.
But as more cynical observers point out, a few weeks of post-election
manoeuvring will at least give those companies still sitting on the fence
plenty of time to adjust their politics to the prevailing mood.

FT  25 MAR 94 / The Italian Election: Magistrates seek to defuse row over
Berlusconi raid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Senior members of the Italian magistrature yesterday sought to reduce the
political tension caused by Wednesday's removal by police of documents on
candidates from Mr Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia headquarters. Meeting in
special session they said the action so close to the elections was 'at best
inopportune', writes Robert Graham.
Mr Berlusconi was yesterday granted a meeting with President Oscar Luigi
Scalfaro during which he voiced his concern about the behaviour of
magistrates. The police action had been prompted by a request for lists of
Forza Italia candidates and club members in various parts of Italy. It came
from a magistrate at Palmi near Reggio Calabria investigating the links
between membership of secret masonic lodges and organised crime.
However, it emerged yesterday that the request for the information had come
from a magistrate who was shortly due to be posted away from Palmi. It is
possible that disciplinary action will follow.
But while saying the timing of the police action was inappropriate, the
senior magistrates pointed out that there had been no 'seizure' of documents
 -merely a normal request for information.
Mr Berlusconi denounced the move as political intimidation by the
magistrature which he claimed was infiltrated by the former communist Party
of the Democratic Left (PDS).
Yesterday there were signs the incident had been itself blown out of all
proportion by Forza Italia to pose in the guise of victim. Mr Berlusconi
himself played the victim late on Wednesday in his sole television debate
with his main opponent, Mr Achille Occhetto, PDS leader. The debate was
largely taken up with mutual recrimination and neither went into details of
his economic programme.
Yesterday, in an unusual move, the leaders of Italy's unions and
Confindustria, the industrialists' federation, appealed for last July's
historic wage productivity deal to be honoured by the next government. This
was an implicit warning to Mr Berlusconi with his free market ideas on
labour relations to keep his hands off it.

FT  25 MAR 94 / The Italian Election: The new political geography form left
to right
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Chamber of Deputies (lower house): 630 seats. 48.3m voters (18 years or
older). Voter has two votes, one for individual candidates and one for
party lists. 475 seats in single-seat, plurality contests grouped into
26 constituencies. Voters vote for individual candidates. 155 seats
allocated by a form of proportional representation (PR). Voters vote
for party lists.
Senate: 315 seats. 42.7m (25 years or older). Voter has one vote,
castable for a candidate (either linked to a party list or an
independent) in a single-member seat. 232 single-seat, simple-plurality
contests, grouped into 20 constituencies. 18 regions have additional
seats (83 nationwide) allocated by a form of PR.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
PROGRESSIVE ALLIANCE
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Democratic Party of the Left (PDS)
Leader: Achille Occhetto
Dominant in the alliance, with highly effective infrastructure. Heir to
Communist Party, now espousing social democracy and hoping to
demonstrate Italy is mature enough to have its first post-war
government of the left. Ably led by the first political leader to see
the importance of alliances under new electoral laws.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Reconstructed Communists
Leader: Fausto Bertinotti
Rump of former Communist Party that refused to foreswear Marxism and
join PDS; leader is former head of a hardline faction within the main
trades union federation. Core of support is in industrial areas. Party
at loggerheads with PDS on tax policy (raise taxes on government bonds)
and foreign policy (withdraw Italy from Nato).
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Democratic Alliance
Leading figure: Giuseppe Ayala
Conceived as umbrella of centre-left to attract politicians across
traditional party lines when old political system faced collapse. Main
figures are Republican Party, like former anti-mafia judge Ayala, plus
a few Christian Democrats and from PDS. But it has not found way to
avoid being swallowed by PDS.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
La Rete
Leader: Leoluca Orlando
Sicily-based clean government movement. Leader is former Christian
Democrat mayor of Palermo who was triumphantly re-elected on Rete
ticket last December. The movement, left-wing Catholic in inspiration
with isolated pockets of strong support nationwide, will sweep western
Sicily.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Greens
Leading figure: Carlo Ripa di Meana
Despite constant internal scraps, the Greens have broadened their
appeal with a semi-collegiate leadership and the distant stewardship of
Ripa di Meana, a former EU commissioner. Important in attracting young
voters plus support in areas with major environmental concerns.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
PACT FOR ITALY
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Popular Party (PPI)
Leader: Mino Martinazzoli
Formed from the mainstream of the dissolved Christian Democrat Party.
Under its leader, the former Christian Democrat head, it seeks to be
the Catholic party of the centre, but appeal has been weakened by
corruption scandals and the lack of known new figures to promote.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Segni Pact
Leader: Mario Segni
Movement gathered round referendum leader Segni but has sufferedfrom
his oscillations. Having left the Christian Democrats and refused to
deal with either the PDS or Forza Italia, he is now effectively back as
the leader of the old/renewed Christian Democrats as the balancing
force in the centre.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
ALLIANCE FOR FREEDOM
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Forza Italia
Leader: Silvio Berlusconi
Movement created in less than four months by media magnate Berlusconi,
using the resources of his Fininvest empire. He defines movement as
'liberal', endorsing free-market policies. But success has been based
on leader's self-made-man image and the novelty of Forza Italia.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Northern League
Leader: Umberto Bossi
Populist movement in northern Italy that gathered round Bossi's
charisma and pugnacious oratory. Movement has since graduated from a
protest force to a genuine party with federalist demands. Remains
rooted in the north and has been forced by the electoral system to seek
uncomfortable allies like Forza Italia and National Alliance.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
National Alliance/MSI
Leader: Gianfranco Fini
The neo-fascist MSI rebaptised as the National Alliance. Fini, the most
astute young politician in the country, has sought to shake-off the
party's long-standing identification with the Mussolini era. The party,
which has benefitted from the collapse of the traditional ruling
parties, is strongest in the south.

FT  25 MAR 94 / Two cities campaign for soul of Ukraine: Anger over the
first two years of independence will be vented in Sunday's election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A generation ago western Ukrainian partisans fought eastern Ukrainian Soviet
soldiers in forests outside of Lviv (formerly the Soviet city of Lvov)
during the second world war. Today they are all citizens of Ukraine. But the
historical and cultural divide between Ukraine's more nationalist west and
Russian-oriented east are again intensifying and threatening to sever the
fragile social fabric of this two-year-old nation.
As the final straight of independent Ukraine's first parliamentary elections
this Sunday approaches, very different debates are shaping up in two cities,
1,200km apart, of this geographical conflict. The election's results are
likely to usher new extremes into the parliament, now dominated by
like-minded former communists and party bosses who have led the country to
hyperinflation, a dire energy crisis and poverty.
In Lviv, an Austrian-Hapsburg architectural gem 60km from the Polish border,
nationalism is exploding into radicalism and fascism. 'Ukraine for
Ukrainians' and other xenophobic slogans are often heard as people,
especially the youth, are disillusioned with the economic results the
moderate democrat-nationalists they once supported have brought them.
In Donetsk, a worn-out coal-mining town 60km from the Russian border,
nationalism is virtually non-existent. The people, almost entirely Russian
speakers and nearly half of whom are ethnic Russians, are clamouring for a
'Union with Russia', by which they mean closer economic ties, and autonomy
from mismanaged Kiev. There is great disillusionment with the first two
years of Ukrainian independence in which personal fortunes have declined
instead of improved. For these two border cities, the election is less about
throwing out the old Soviet legacy, but is more a battle for the Ukrainian
soul.
Lviv wants to take over Kiev and create a unified nationalist state where
everyone speaks Ukrainian. Donetsk has given up on Kiev and is holding a
referendum to run their Russified region on their own and re-establish old
ties with Moscow. Kiev's procurator has called this referendum illegal.
A leaked US intelligence report has forecast that a violent east-west civil
war could erupt as Ukraine's economy continued to collapse. In Lviv 19
nationalist parties have launched such an impressively noisy campaign of
mass postering and television advertisements that 'centrist and communist
voices are barely heard or seen', according to an election observer.
The Social-National Party of Ukraine, whose members sport blackshirt
uniforms and use a swastika-like symbol as their logo, have successfully
placed a candidate on the ballot of each of Lviv region's 23 electoral
districts. Three years ago, Rukh, the nationalist-democratic movement, which
rallied the nation to split from the Kremlin, was the dominant political
force. Now Rukh has itself splintered into two factions due to in-fighting.
'Rukh has discredited itself. They promised that we would be like Sweden in
two to three years. Now we're worse off than before independence and people
are looking for an alternative,' said 22-year-old Natalya Balyuk.
Donetsk is in the heart of the coal and metal rich Don River basin. Less
than 10 years ago, the prosperous Soviet coal mining and steel region
attracted hordes of weekend shoppers from the neighbouring Russian city of
Rostov. The choice cuts of meat and sausage are now gone. Today crammed
busloads of Donetsk miners travel in the opposite direction, working for
cut, yet rouble, wages in the Rostov coal pits.
It has been a big fall from grace for a region that was once prized as an
industrial centrepiece of the old Soviet Union. While a majority voted for
independence in 1991, most now regret their decision.
'We had everything then. Where did it all go?' asked Yekaterina Solovyova, a
Russian coal miner's wife (whose husband is Ukrainian). 'We didn't need to
cut all our links and start all these troubles with Moscow. Now it's hard
for me to visit my mother in the Urals (in Russia) because the aircraft
don't fly there.' Ukraine's energy crisis has grounded most flights.
Like many of her neighbours, Mrs Solovyova plans to vote Yes to the four
questions on the ballot this Sunday: 1. Should Russian be an official
language along with Ukrainian?; 2. Should Ukraine have a federal structure,
where power is decentralised? 3. Should Russian be used in official
documents and in education along with Ukrainian?; and 4. Should Ukraine join
the CIS charter as a full member and become part of the economic union?
Language, curiously, comes up twice in the questions. It is a particularly
sensitive point in a region where the Ukrainian language seems foreign. In
Lviv, Russian may be the language of Soviet oppressors. But in Donetsk,
Russian has been their history for the last 350 years. Mrs Solovyova
explains: 'Why can't Russian be an official language too? That's what we
speak. You know, I used to feel that I could be part of Ukraine, but now I
don't feel Ukrainian at all. I just feel Soviet.'
1917: Kiev successfully resists Bolshevik takeover
1918: Central and western Ukraine form independent Ukrainian state. It
becomes the principle battleground for the Russian civil war
1920: Central and eastern Ukraine under Soviet rule. Western Ukraine is
part of Poland
1932: Some 7m peasants die in artificial famine
1939: After signing of Molotov-Ribbentrop pact between Nazi Germany and
the USSR, Soviet armies march into western Ukraine
1945: All Ukraine becomes Soviet republic; in western Ukraine fierce
partisan opposition to Russian rule is only quelled in late 1950s
1991: National-communist alliance leads breakaway from Moscow,
contributing to break-up of Soviet Union. On December 1, more than 90
per cent of Ukrainians vote for independence and elect Leonid Kravchuk,
a former communist ideologue, president

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Swedish gross national product fell by 2.1 per cent in 1993. This was the
third successive decline, making the recession the longest this century. But
an export-led recovery - which the government is depending on to save it in
September's general election - got under way in the latter part of the year,
with GNP rising by 0.4 per cent in the last quarter. Nordbanken predicted
GNP would grow by 2.5 per cent this year and by 3.5 per cent next year.
However, the domestic economy, burdened by a huge budget deficit, continues
to lag, with household incomes falling by a record 3.8 per cent last year
and employment by 5.6 per cent. Nordbanken forecast a further fall this year
in both public and household consumption, while unemployment was set to
stand at 8 per cent. Another 5-6 per cent of the workforce are on government
training schemes.
Foreign investment in Russia totalled Dollars 2.9bn in 1993, some 90 per
cent of which came in the form of equity participation.
Germany's trade surplus contracted to DM5.9bn (Pounds 2.3bn) in January from
DM8.5bn a month earlier, while the current account deficit rose to DM5.7bn
from DM800m in December.
Denmark's preliminary unadjusted trade surplus rose to DKr43.01bn (Pounds
4.3bn) in 1993 from DKr34.88bn in 1992.

Mr Alexander Shokhin, the Russian government's longest-serving minister, was
yesterday promoted from economy minister to deputy prime minister in charge
of the economy. He said after a cabinet meeting yesterday that Russia's
tight financial policy would cause a fall in production of 20 per cent this
year, and that a more 'moderate' course was necessary. Meanwhile, the US
television network NBC yesterday reported that Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian
president, had 'life-threatening' cirrhosis of the liver. The report, based
on a security source and two former Russian diplomats, is the latest in a
spate of rumours since the 63-year-old president retired last week to the
Black Sea resort of Sochi to recuperate from a three-week illness. However,
his aides repeated that he was in good health and would be back to work in a
few days after resting well.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EU environment and transport ministers yesterday backed in principle a
European Commission plan to tighten up inspection procedures for
sub-standard ships, as part of the effort to reduce the high rate of
accidents in EU waters. Ministers also agreed that member states should
detain in port unsafe ships 'until all major deficiencies have been
rectified'.
The Commission underlined that the use of ships more than 15 years old had
doubled over the past four years. But the EU still cannot decide whether to
restrict shipping from waters near environmentally sensitive areas, or on a
civil liability regime for owners of hazardous cargos using sub-standard
shipping. Traditionally, EU states have acted individually through the
International Maritime Organisation. But following a spate of oil tanker
disasters pressure has built up for the EU to police European waters more
vigorously.

FT  25 MAR 94 / Brussels launches fraud hotline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Organised crime is to blame for a 50 per cent increase to Ecu394m (Pounds
297m) in reported fraud against the European Union budget last year, the
Commission said yesterday.
Criminals were exploiting the dismantling of internal borders in the single
European market to carry out ever more sophisticated fraud, said Mr Peter
Schmidhuber, budget commissioner.
The German commissioner responded yesterday with a fresh anti-fraud
offensive, including a free-phone service aimed at encouraging informers to
tip off Brussels.
Most cases of fraud occurred in the Ecu35bn a year Common Agricultural
Policy budget which offers generous price supports, export subsidies and
refunds to Europe's farmers.
In one typical instance, French and Italian criminals bought refined sugar
in Rotterdam claiming it was bound for Croatia and Slovenia. But the cargo
was diverted secretly to Italy, via Belgium, Luxembourg and France, possibly
for sweetening wine.
The estimated fraud was Ecu1.6m, the net effect of the effort to circumvent
the mandatory compensatory levy for placing sugar on the EU market.
Mr Schmidhuber said it was impossible to calculate precisely how much money
was being lost as a result of fraud because the Commmission relied on cases
being reported by member states. But he admitted: 'The amount of fraud is
obviously far higher than we have detected.'
The Commission's new fraud action plan includes more use of computers,
remote sensing to track phantom olive groves, and a plan for a free-phone
service in each EU country so that the public can report frauds to the
Commission's fraud task force.
'I know we won't only get serious calls. There is the risk of crank calls
and pranksters, but we still think it is worthwhile taking that risk,' he
said. Mr Schmidhuber said the Commission was also examining whether to set
up an informers' fund and a blacklist of companies and individuals caught
engaging in fraud. But both were fraught with legal difficulties.

FT  25 MAR 94 / Bonn and Paris plan EU ostpolitik
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Germany and France will launch a joint initiative to develop a common
European 'ostpolitik' during their consecutive presidencies of the European
Union in 1994 and 1995, Mr Klaus Kinkel, German foreign minister, said last
night.
The two governments have agreed to co-ordinate their EU policies for the
year from July 1, and the strategy towards central and eastern Europe is top
of the German agenda.
Mr Kinkel spelt out details in an important statement of Bonn's European
strategy to the French institute for international relations in Paris.
His five-point programme for an EU ostpolitik would put opening of the west
European market as its highest priority, combined with maximum involvement
of the associated states in central and eastern Europe in the EU's common
foreign and security policy.
While he spelt out support for Russia as a key element of any policy, he
stressed the need for a coherent EU policy towards Ukraine.
'The economic crisis (in Ukraine) and the tensions with Russia affect us
directly,' he said. 'They could have far-reaching consequences. . . We must
act together to ensure Ukraine is brought rapidly within our European
co-operation system.'
He called at the same time for a 'coherent' EU policy towards the Baltic
republics, intended to 'draw these countries ever closer to the Union'.
Russian troops must be withdrawn on time.
He also outlined an initiative with Mr Alain Juppe, the French foreign
minister, to launch a 'Europe-wide Marshall Plan of the mind' for eastern
Europe, to promote all forms of scientific and university exchanges,
bringing thousands of students and scientists into west European
universities, and sending western teachers to the east.
The two nations will also press to make the Maastricht treaty a reality, for
more energetic promotion of a European security policy as a pillar of the
Atlantic alliance; and for an active Mediterranean policy, to promote
development in the Maghreb region.

FT  25 MAR 94 / Cash merry-go-round puts M3 in a spin: Why is Germany's
money supply sky high? It's mostly a question of avoiding tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Built of glass and steel, the Deutsche Bank headquarters on the outskirts of
Luxembourg looks more like a cross between an art gallery and a
high-security prison than a branch of Germany's biggest bank.
Enter the imposing building and the customer is confronted with a 9.2
metre-high sculpture which would not be out of place on the set of Jurassic
Park, the Spielberg dinosaur movie. The walls are hung with garish paintings
and there is not a cash-dispenser in sight.
Although lacking the facilities of a normal bank branch, this is the biggest
credit institute in the Grand Duchy, a temple of mammon built in tribute to
the colossal sums of money which slosh backwards and forwards between
Germany and its tiny neighbour.
The sloshing has become more pronounced in recent months, generating huge
profits for the German banks (Deutsche Bank Luxembourg last week announced a
51 per cent increase in earnings) and helping to trigger the explosive
growth in German money supply in January and February.
Over the last three years at least DM300bn (Pounds 116bn) has been parked by
Germans in offshore accounts. The money has gone primarily to the Grand
Duchy, says Mr Peter Pietsch, an economist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt,
although Switzerland, Austria and the Channel Islands have also benefited
from the cash exodus.
Much of it has found its way to Luxembourg in the form of banknotes stuffed
into suitcases and carrier bags, unloaded over the counter and booked into
discreet numbered accounts at any one of the Grand Duchy's 218 banks. But
there is no need to make the drive down the Mosel valley, banknotes stashed
in the boot - simply pay a visit to any bank branch in Germany and the
customer is inundated with suggestions as to how money can be transferred at
the flick of a computer switch.
Underlining the symbiotic links between Luxembourg and Germany, most of the
cash has then flowed back into the German capital markets, invested by the
banks in German government securities on their customers' behalf. It is
estimated that of the DM230bn spent by 'foreigners' buying bunds last year,
nearly DM50bn came from Germans investing in their home market principally
via Luxembourg funds. This followed an inflow of DM46bn to Germany from
Luxembourg in 1992.
The catalyst to the capital movement is tax. For five years the German
government has been struggling to find a way to tax interest earned on
savings. Whilst the Finance Ministry has experimented with one form of tax
after another, Germans have voted with their wallets - transferring their
savings across the border to Luxembourg where there is no tax on interest
income.
Although there is nothing illegal about transferring cash to Luxembourg, so
long as the income is later declared in tax returns, the German tax
authorities are convinced that the big banks have been helping their
customers to evade rather than merely avoid tax commitments.
Hence the spectacular raids on Dresdner Bank branches in Frankfurt and
Dusseldorf in January, when 40 tax officials confiscated documents and
opened up the postbag between head office in Germany and the bank's branch
in Luxembourg. The authorities alleged that the bank was systematically
helping its customers shovel cash across to Luxembourg in order to evade
tax; an incensed Dresdner has denied any impropriety and is planning to take
its case to the Federal Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe.
Ironically enough, this court has already played a major role in stimulating
capital flight. On June 27 1991 it ruled that the government must
re-introduce a tax on interest income, having dropped a previous levy
because of its disastrous impact on the German capital market.
The government's response was the so-called Zinsabschlagsteuer (ZAST), a 30
per cent tax on interest income which is deducted at source by banks when
they credit the interest to bund holders. This came into effect at the
beginning of last year.
Despite sharply increased thresholds for tax-free interest, private savers
reacted with what the Bundesbank described as 'fairly massive evasive
reactions and roundabout transactions via neighbouring financial centres'.
The natural vehicle for such transactions were Luxembourg funds. The number
of such funds managed by German institutions rose from 32 to 168 between
1991 and 1993. Over the past five years the number of German banks
represented in the Grand Duchy rose from 40 to 63.
The roundabout continued in the latter months of last year when Germans
repatriated at least DM25bn out of Luxembourg back to Germany. This reversal
of the usual pattern reflected a change in the tax law affecting rolled-up
interest. The flow of funds back to Germany was a key reason behind the
surge in M3 money supply in December to February which has in turn made it
harder for the Bundesbank to cut interest rates despite sharply falling
inflation.
If the Luxembourg connection has dealt a knock to the Bundesbank's
credibility, the German government has suffered a more tangible blow: to its
tax revenues. The ZAST has proved a disappointing source of income at a time
when every penny of tax is helpful to plug a yawning budget deficit. Total
income from the tax last year was DM11bn - far below the projected DM24bn.
But Mr Thomas Mayer, international economist at Goldman Sachs in Frankfurt,
says the ZAST was deliberately designed to be less than wholly effective.
'There has been a silent collusion between the state and the investor,' he
claims. If the tax had been watertight, Germans masquerading as foreign
investors would not have bought bunds in such huge quantities last year.
Their purchases drove capital market interest rate to historic lows in 1993,
helping the state to finance its deficit more cheaply than if the money had
gone elsewhere.
Such a suggestion elicits no more than a harrumph from the Bonn Finance
Ministry, which sticks to its position that it will use the German
presidency of the European Union in the second half of the year to try to
harmonise tax on interest income throughout the EU. Such an agreement would
eliminate the catalyst to capital flows within the EU, but Luxembourg may be
difficult to bring into line.
'There is no point in reaching agreement just within the EU,' says a senior
Luxembourg official. 'The money would just go to Switzerland or Austria.'
Luxembourg sticks to its position that it wants tax harmonisation within all
OECD countries. This laudable goal is unlikely to be realised for decades,
if ever, ensuring that the money roundabout will continue to revolve.

FT  25 MAR 94 / Gillette rejects rescue offer
</HEADLINE>

   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Gillette, the US consumer products group at the centre of a row over plans
to transfer production from Spain, yesterday insisted it would go ahead with
plans to close the Spanish factory.
The Socialist regional government of Andalucia said it had offered to
finance the investment required to maintain the razor-blade plant at Alcala
de Guadaira near Seville, but the US company had refused the offer.
Mr Francisco Oliva, chief regional employment official, said the Andalucian
authorities would ask the European Commission to investigate Gillette's plan
to move production to plants in Berlin and Isleworth, west London.
After separate meetings yesterday with Gillette management and employees at
the factory, he said the company was under an obligation to try to reach an
agreement with its workforce and if it failed to do so might be liable to
penalties.
Spanish officials claim that the Spanish subsidiary, which made a pre-tax
profit of Pta700m (Pounds 3.36m) last year, does not meet the legal criteria
in Spain for justifying collective redundancy.
No further meetings between the company and local authorities have been
scheduled.
The Boston-based group said its decision to close the Spanish operation,
which employs just under 250, was part of a plan announced earlier this year
to reduce excess manufacturing capacity, which was the result of improved
manufacturing facilities. The restructuring is due to affect 2,000 jobs
worldwide, mostly outside the US.
The UK and German plants had been 'integrated into facility upgrading', but
the Spanish plant had older technology and was still geared to making
fixed-head blades.
'Berlin and Isleworth can take care of western Europe very nicely,' a
Gillette spokesman said.
The company denied it was engaged in 'social dumping' by shipping production
to Russia, Poland and China, where wages were much lower. Its ventures in
these countries were unconnected with the European market.

Bundesbank's 4-6 per cent target.
The figure, for the broad M3 measure of money supply including time and
savings deposits, was immediately discounted by the central bank as a
continuing reflection of the extraordinary growth in December and January,
exaggerated when calculated on an annual basis.
For the first time the bank published a figure for the growth in money
supply compared with the previous quarter, which it put at 4.1 per cent for
February, according to preliminary calculations.
There was general confidence in the financial markets that the high money
supply figures, expected to remain in double figures for some months, would
not divert the Bundesbank from its strat-egy of gradual interest rate cuts.
Some analysts warned, however, that the special factors which caused
December's figure to rise by 8.1 per cent, before the January record, are
still having a big effect on M3: they include a surge in house buying and
building, and the refusal of traditional bond investors to return to that
market from short-term deposit accounts.
The Bundesbank pointed out that bank credit to enterprises and individuals
actually declined - new loans totalled DM9.9bn (Pounds 3.85bn) in the month
compared with DM12.8bn a year earlier, although total lending rose in the
past six months at a seasonally adjusted 10 per cent annualised rate.
Bank credit to the public sector increased rapidly, by DM6.7bn, and public
authority deposits with the Bundesbank declined by a further DM2.5bn,
showing that the deficit financing of the public sector continues to have a
strong expansionary effect on money supply.
The most important factors distorting money supply in December were massive
repatriation of capital from outside Germany, because of the abolition of
tax benefits for accrued interest funds in neighbouring Luxembourg; and a
surge in borrowing for house purchases, with the imminent expiry of special
tax allowances for buying old properties.
What happened in January was that the repatriated funds failed to return to
the bond markets, as expected, because of turbulent conditions and a turn
upwards in long-term interest rates. The money remained in relatively
short-term deposit accounts and financial instruments.
Nor has house-purchasing activity declined significantly, because the
expectation that the steady decline in interest rates is coming to an end
has encouraged more borrowers to take out mortgages.
Opinion among analysts is divided between those who believe the distortions
in the M3 figures make them largely irrelevant, and those who believe they
point to long-term inflationary potential.
'The number was better than some had feared,' said Mr Julian Jessop of
Midland Global Markets Research, 'but it doesn't matter what M3 does,
neither for German monetary policy, nor for the market. The real issue is
inflation, and that is likely to turn out at 3.1 per cent for this month,
and could be below 3 per cent in April. This means the Bundesbank could cut
its rates when the policy-making council meets on April 28.
The Bank of France yesterday cut its key intervention rate by 0.1 percentage
point to 6 per cent, writes Alice Rawsthorn.
The reduction, following Wednesday's cut in the German repo rate, reflected
the Bank of France's eagerness to keep pace with the Germans, but its modest
scale illustrated the bank's concern about the weakness of the franc.

FT  25 MAR 94 / Allied-Lyons to pay Pounds 739m for Pedro Domecq
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Allied-Lyons, the UK drinks and food group, is to pay Pounds 739m for
control of Pedro Domecq Group, the Spanish drinks producer.
Allied said yesterday the deal would make it the world's second largest
spirits producer, with 13 of the top 100 spirits brands.
Allied will finance the purchase with a Pounds 651m rights issue. It
forecast its pre-tax profits in the year to March 1994 at Pounds 604m, or
Pounds 630m before exceptionals, compared to Pounds 620m before exceptionals
the year before.
Allied said it would change its name to Allied Domecq, dropping the name of
J. Lyons - once famous for its teashops - which Allied acquired in 1978. The
top management of the family-owned Domecq are to remain. Mr Ramon
Mora-Figueroa, Domecq's chief executive, is expected to join the Allied
board, although Allied refused to comment.
Domecq, best known in the UK for sherry brands such as La Ina, made 50 per
cent of its profits last year from Mexico, where it owns Presidente, the
largest-selling brandy in the world. Allied will also take control of Sauza,
Mexico's second largest tequila brand. Mr Tony Hales, Allied's chief
executive, said 'the Domecq brands are a real gateway for us in Latin
America.'
In a complex deal Allied, which already owns 32 per cent of Domecq, will buy
out the 500-strong Domecq family, whose members want to realise their
holdings. Mr Mora-Figueroa, who belongs to the family, will protect its
position by retaining a 27 per cent holding in Domecq, with the option to
sell to Allied over the next six years. Allied said he was not expected to
sell within the first year. Mr Mora-Figueroa said 'hopefully' Allied would
eventually own 100 per cent.
Mr Michael Jackaman, Allied's chairman, said the deal would concentrate the
group's focus on drinks and retailing. Allied also has food manufacturing
interests, and in 1992 merged its UK brewing interests into a joint venture
with Carlsberg of Denmark.
Allied said its sales of spirits would almost double from 23m cases to 45m a
year. Based on volume sales of the world's top 100 spirits brands, this put
it second to Grand Metropolitan of the UK and ahead of Guinness.
Allied said the purchase price for Domecq, which made just under Pta20bn
(Pounds 97m) before tax and restructuring costs last year, represented 15.2
times last year's earnings. Allied's share price fell 7 per cent to 561p.
Analysts said the rights issue had been unexpected and the profits forecast
was disappointing.

FT  25 MAR 94 / Stock and bond markets badly hit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets and Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
International stock and bond prices fell sharply yesterday, shaken by the
assassination of Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio, Mexico's leading presidential
candidate and by renewed worries over the rise in US interest rates.
The Dow Jones industrial average finished 48.37 points down at 3,821.09 in
heavy volume of 303m shares. The falling market earlier triggered the New
York Stock Exchange's 'uptick rule,' which restricts computerised trading in
periods of volatility.
Moves by some of the US's largest banks to raise their prime rates on
Wednesday, in response to the Federal Reserve's latest credit tightening the
day before, contributed to the bearish mood.
The assassination prompted a sharp fall in Mexican bonds in New York and
London, pulling down other Latin American debt markets in their wake.
Mexico's 30-year benchmark 'Brady bond', issued as part of the country's
1990 debt restruct uring, dropped to 69 1/2 from 73, but bounced off its 66
1/2 low, said Mr Denis Loubignac, a trader at Paribas Capital Markets in
London. The Mexican benchmark Eurobond, a 10-year dollar- denominated bond
for Banco mext, fell from 90 to 86 1/4 , but rose from its intraday low of
84.
The fall in Latin American debt had a domino effect on US treasuries and
European govern ment bonds.
Mr George Magnus, chief international economist at SG War burg in London,
said there were fears that international investors would have to lighten
their holdings of US and European government bonds in order to offset losses
on their investments in Latin American debt.
Long-dated gilts fell by more than 2 points yesterday and the pace of the
fall prompted the Bank of England to attempt to stabilise the market by
offering to buy back cash gilts from marketmakers.
Mexico yesterday joined the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and
Development. Membership was agreed by the 'rich nations club' in June last
year.

FT  25 MAR 94 / Prudential refuses to join retail investment watchdog
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Prudential Corporation, the UK's largest life insurer, has rejected the
prospect of joining the Personal Investment Authority, the new regulator to
protect private investors.
It is insisting instead on its right to come directly under the Securities
and Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog.
That brings Prudential into direct conflict with the regulators, since Mr
Andrew Large, SIB chairman, has made it clear it wanted to end SIB's role in
direct regulation of retail financial services.
In a strongly worded statement, Mr Mick Newmarch, Prudential chief
executive, said Prudential did not believe the PIA's approach to regulation
was suited to providing 'adequate and cost-effective saver protection'.
It had concluded that the option of statutory regulation by the SIB was more
consistent with its point of view and in the best interests of its
customers, Mr Newmarch said.
From July, the PIA is intended to be the single watchdog for retail
financial services, replacing the existing system of separate regulators for
different types of organisation, such as independent financial advisers and
life companies.
Mr Newmarch said the fact that the PIA had not yet developed its own
rulebook, but planned to begin its work as a regulator using the rules of
the existing regulators, seemed to involve 'giving a blank cheque to PIA
when nothing in its history justifies that level of confidence'.
At an earlier stage, such a stark challenge to the prospects for the PIA
might have derailed the new regulator. But with less than a fortnight to go
before the first deadline for applications, and some previous critics - such
as Standard Life and Scottish Amicable - making it clear they will join, the
PIA still appears poised to go ahead. Halifax, the UK's largest building
society, earlier this week expressed serious reservations and said it had
not decided whether to apply.
The Prudential's decision was greeted with statements of regret by the SIB,
the PIA and the government.
The Treasury response underlined ministers' continuing determination not to
be pushed into legislating for a full-blown statutory system of regulation -
as Prudential would prefer.
It expressed full support for the SIB's approach and added: 'Neither the PIA
nor its timetable will be in any way deflected by the Pru's decision.'
In practice, the SIB will be able to delegate the routine regulation to the
PIA and can apply PIA standards. But it will still have to carry out its own
disciplinary proceedings.

FT  25 MAR 94 / Mexico in crisis after killing: Political turmoil after
assassination of the ruling PRI party candidate Colosio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER and STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mexico has been thrown into political turmoil by the assassination of Mr
Luis Donaldo Colosio, the presidential candidate of the ruling Institutional
Revolutionary party (PRI).
The death of Mr Colosio, who was shot in the head and chest late on
Wednesday in the border city of Tijuana, heightened fears of instability
just weeks after an Indian rebellion in the southern state of Chiapas and
after months of economic stagnation.
Mexico's attorney-general said yesterday that Mario Aburto Martinez, 23, had
admitted to the killing, although his motive was not yet known. Mr Aburto, a
mechanic arrested at the scene, had claimed to be a pacifist.
Despite the closure of Mexico's financial markets yesterday, the price of
Mexican shares and bonds fell sharply in London and New York, although they
recovered from their lows. New York analysts said prices of New York-quoted
Mexican shares suggested a fall of 4-5 per cent in the Mexican stock market.
However, last night the US set up a Dollars 6bn (Pounds 4bn) credit line to
help Mexico weather financial jitters when markets reopen today.
The PRI, or more likely in practice President Carlos Salinas de Gortari,
will have to select a new presidential candidate for this August's election.
Under Mexico's constitution, officials are not permitted to run for the
presidency if they have held government office in the six months before the
elections. This means that unless the constitution is changed, no member of
the current cabinet could run.
This would leave Mr Ernesto Zedillo, former education minister and Mr
Colosio's campaign manager, as the front-runner. Although Mr Zedillo is
considered politically inexperienced, his chances of being chosen as the
PRI's new candidate improved last night when another leading contender, Mr
Manuel Camacho, the peace envoy to the troubled southern state of Chiapas,
said he would not stand.
However, Dr Ignacio Burgoa, professor emeritus of law at the National
Autonomus University of Mexico, says the government, with the support of at
least one opposition party, could muster enough votes to change the
constitution in 10 to 15 days. That would enable Mr Pedro Aspe, finance
minister, and a host of other cabinet ministers to run.
Mexico's ruling party has been in power for 65 years, and Mr Colosio was the
favourite to win the August elections. A former social development minister
and president of the PRI, he represented continuity with the economic and
political policies of President Salinas.
The new candidate will be weakened by being the party's second choice, and
will have just five months to set up his campaign. Democratic reforms,
passed by Congress on Wednesday night, go a long way in letting the
opposition compete on equal terms with the PRI, making elections potentially
the most competitive in the nation's history. On the other hand, the
sympathy felt for the PRI after Mr Colosio's assassination may lead to an
increase in support.
Mr Salinas appealed to Mexicans for calm and unity, and appeared to rule out
the possibility of a state of emergency.
The assassination of Mr Colosio comes in a period of unusual political
instability, and the possibility of a conservative backlash was being aired
yesterday. Many Mexicans saw a link between the peasant uprising in Chiapas,
last week's kidnapping of Mr Alfredo Harp Helu, the co-head of Mexico's
largest bank, and Mr Colosio's murder.
Mexico's economy has also been vulnerable in recent weeks, with the peso
having depreciated sharply against the dollar as the government sought to
boost a stagnant economy. The Bank of Mexico is expected to defend the peso
today when markets reopen.

FT  24 MAR 94 / International Company News: Vard may agree to demands for
EGM
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Vard, the troubled Norwegian cruise and ferry group, is expected today to
announce an extraordinary general meeting to consider demands of disgruntled
shareholders seeking to force a sweeping reorganisation of the board to
reflect recent changes in the group's ownership structure.
Shareholders have expressed dissatisfaction with the way Vard is being run,
frustration over losses and claims that the board has failed to implement a
strategy to dispose of assets in order to reduce the group's debt.
However, US-based Radisson Diamond is reported to be seeking to acquire one
of Vard's three cruise lines for an estimated Dollars 250m. Mr Torstein
Hagen, a Vard board member and member of the board of Kloster Cruise, the
group's cruise unit, is also reported to be considering a separate bid.
Mr Knut Kloster Jr, a Vard board member and chairman of the board of Kloster
Cruise, was forced recently to make a large disposal of Vard shares,
shrinking his stake to just over 7 per cent and thereby reducing his
influence over the group.
Following the disposal, Uni Storebrand, Norway's biggest insurer, emerged as
Vard's biggest shareholder, owning just under 10 per cent of the share
capital.
Vard's divided board could see the exit of Mr Terje Mikalsen, chairman, Mr
Kloster Jr, Mrs Trine Kloster, his mother, and close friend Mr Joergen Heje.
Mr Trygve Hegnar, a board member and second biggest shareholder - who is
aligned with dissident shareholders - is said to harbour hopes of becoming
chairman, while Uni Storebrand is widely expected to demand board
representation.
Shareholder frustration swelled in January when a Dollars 565m deal to
dispose of two of the group's three up-market cruise lines collapsed, but
became exacerbated by last month's announcement of deeper losses in 1993.

FT  24 MAR 94 / Japanese motor output down 14%: February figures continue
17-month decline
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Japan's motor industry output fell 14.1 per cent in February against the
same period last year, the 17th consecutive monthly fall. The industry's
performance underlines the depth of Japan's recession. Production of cars,
trucks and buses fell to 896,000 units, the sixth month the decline has been
in double digits, and a post-war record.
Japanese car manufacturers have been badly hit by the strength of the yen,
which has contributed to a 24 per cent fall in exports. Domestic demand fell
6.2 per cent to 519,000 units. Passenger car production fell 14.5 per cent
compared with the same month last year, the 11th month output has declined.
Production of trucks fell 13 per cent to 214,000 units, the 31st month that
output has decreased.
Toyota's vehicle production fell 12.3 per cent during February to 279,500
units; Nissan's dropped 13.4 per cent to 143,000; Mitsubishi's 10.3 per cent
to 111,700; Mazda's 16.8 per cent to 92,000 and Honda's was down 14.6 per
cent at 92,800.
Japan's opposition Liberal Democratic party yesterday agreed to a
parliamentary schedule that will allow bills for a large income tax cut to
be enacted next week, Reuter adds. The tax bills must be passed by March 31,
the last day of the current fiscal year, or they expire automatically.
The Y6,000bn (Dollars 56.6bn) tax cut is one of the pillars in Mr Hosokawa's
package of anti-recession measures which were announced last month.

FT  24 MAR 94 / Cambodian troops find the going tough: Iain Simpson on
problems encountered after the fall of the Khmer Rouge main base
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAIN SIMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cambodian government troops occupying the former Khmer Rouge headquarters at
Pailin may have defeated one enemy but they still have to deal with several
others. Unseasonal rain is wreaking havoc on a new dirt road built to supply
them with food and ammunition, while malaria is affecting both health and
morale.
After two weeks of heavy fighting, government commanders say they are in
control of the former Khmer Rouge base at Pailin, although guerrillas still
occupy commanding positions nearby.
In the end, the victory at Pailin came rapidly and there is talk in the
Cambodian capital that this could mark the end of the Khmer Rouge as a
viable force. It is a big political blow to the faction, but the loss of a
main base will not stop small units from continuing their campaign of
violence in the countryside.
The loss of Pailin is also a serious financial blow to the Khmer Rouge. Gem
mines and timber in the area are believed to have earned millions of dollars
a year.
Senior military officers say at least 10,000 government troops supported by
heavy artillery and helicopter gunships were involved in the assault on
Pailin. Approaching from three directions they squeezed the few remaining
defenders towards the border with Thailand.
When they finally reached Pailin only 200 guerrillas were waiting for them,
but soon afterwards volleys of shells from the nearby hills began landing at
the former base. Now the officers say government soldiers are pushing into
the hills to clear out remaining Khmer Rouge pockets.
Pailin is surrounded by hills and as long as the Khmer Rouge retain
positions on the higher ground, the government's hold on the base will not
be secure. Already one government helicopter has come under sustained fire
from Khmer Rouge positions.
The main obstacle now facing the government side is the logistics. 'Their
ability to supply and communicate with their troops is being severely
stretched,' one diplomat said.
Approaching Pailin from the east, troops armed with chainsaws, bulldozers
and heavy military trucks literally cut a new road through the jungle. The
road twists and turns around trees and thick clumps of bamboo, trapping
trucks towing heavy artillery. Heavy rains are turning the road into a
quagmire.
At least 20km from the base the road is blocked and the rest of the way is
only passable to military tanks. On Wednesday one tank carrying soldiers and
three freelance photographers to the front hit an anti-tank mine. Two
soldiers were killed.
The state of the roads strikes terror into the hundreds of soldiers being
trucked to Pailin, who know that this is their only escape.
Monsoon rains will start in this part of Cambodia in about two months' time,
churning up the roads even more, making it almost impossible for trucks to
get through to Pailin. If the soldiers cannot be supplied, the base will
almost certainly be lost again.
Despite their apparent victory, morale is low among government troops. They
are short of food and medicine and water supplies are running low. In one
unit most soldiers had not been given their official salary of Dollars 20 a
month for six months before the attack on Pailin.
In February, the government suffered an embarrassing reversal at the
northern Khmer Rouge base of Anlog Veng when its troops were driven out less
than three weeks after they captured it. Khmer Rouge units attacked behind
the government front lines and bombarded government positions, causing heavy
casualties.
Senior officers at Pailin say they have learned important lessons from the
loss of Anlog Veng. They have advanced more slowly and strengthened their
flanks to prevent a Khmer Rouge attack in the rear.
Already though, Khmer Rouge units are starting to take revenge on villages
nearby. Since they lost Pailin, guerrillas have attacked villages in at
least five locations in Battambang province. Eight people have been killed
and many injured in the attack. In Bavel, which has had a lengthy respite
after years of being on the front line, a government ammunition dump was
destroyed when a Khmer Rouge rocket scored a direct hit. Further along the
road a huge crater marked the spot where a score of anti-tank mines had
exploded.
At least 5,000 people have fled from villages near Pailin in the past few
weeks as government troops advanced. They say officials warned them to leave
their homes and now complain that the food aid they were promised has not
arrived. Many are former refugees who resettled here after spending up to 15
years in camps in Thailand. They say all they want now is a peaceful life,
but at the moment they see little hope of that.

British companies had no hope of winning contracts when Malaysia went ahead
with tenders for its new Dollars 3bn airport project, Reuter reports from
Kuala Lumpur.
British companies were free to submit their tender papers, 'but, because of
the government decision not to award to UK companies, there is no likelihood
they are going to get the tender,' Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said
Malaysia announced in February that British contracts in an Anglo-Japanese
consortium to build a new airport were cancelled, in retaliation for British
media allegations of corruption in Malaysia's business dealings.

FT  24 MAR 94 / Leakey decides to quit wildlife job
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NAIROBI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Richard Leakey, East Africa's foremost conservationist, yesterday
abandoned his struggle to protect the Kenya Wildlife Service from political
predators by submitting his second letter of resignation to President Daniel
arap Moi. He said he would not run the KWS under new directives which could
destroy years of pioneering work.
'The KWS dream of a self-financing, efficient, publicly owned but
independent conservation authority does not seem viable in this context,' Mr
Leakey said. He mentioned only two of the new directives: anti-poaching
units, run successfully for the past four years by the KWS, would be placed
under the authority of the Commissioner of Police; and that most KWS
resources, including millions of dollars of donor funds, should be spent
outside its wildlife sanctuaries.
Mr Leakey returned to head the KWS, at the president's request, less than
two weeks ago. He had offered his resignation in January, after charges of
racism and corruption were directed at him by cabinet ministers and
politicians.
President Moi attempted to defuse the international uproar over his
resignation by appointing a committee to examine the workings of the KWS.
The committee's recommendations have not been made public, but they appeared
designed to curtail Mr Leakey's independence, and to siphon off the millions
of dollars of international aid he has raised to fund conservation projects
in Kenya.

FT  24 MAR 94 / Kohl welcomes Major's VE Day gesture

<TEXT>
Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany has warmly welcomed a proposal from
Britain's prime minister, Mr John Major, to invite high-level German
participation next year at 50th anniversary celebrations of the end of the
war in London.
The British leader's invitation, an attempt to defuse a gathering diplomatic
imbroglio over British and French reluctance to invite the German Chancellor
to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Normandy landings, came as Mr Kohl
presented his own agenda of celebrations linked to the end of the second
world war, and the final withdrawal of allied troops from Berlin.
He agreed that it would not be 'appropriate' for him to attend the
forthcoming 50th anniversary celebrations of the D-Day landings.
However, referring to a possible visit to the UK, he said it could be done
in a 'good and dignified manner', and the attendance of German war veterans
would be 'appropriate'.
'The 50th anniversary of the end of the war is an entirely different matter
(to the Normandy landings),' he said. Any suggestion that he had sought an
invitation to Normandy, and had been rebuffed was 'pure fantasy'.
Instead, Mr Kohl and President Francois Mitterrand of France will attend a
European youth festival in Heidelberg two days later.
Mr Kohl announced that the allied withdrawal from Berlin would be celebrated
in two stages, without any full-scale allied military parades.
On August 31, President Boris Yeltsin of Russia will attend ceremonies in
both Berlin and Weimar to mark the departure of the last Russian troops from
German soil.
Nine days later, Mr Kohl has invited President Bill Clinton, Mr Mitterrand
and Mr Major to attend festivities marking the withdrawal from Berlin of the
rest of the wartime allies.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Spain remained impenitent yesterday over its decision to share a platform
with the UK that threatens to delay the enlargement of the Union.
Foreign minister Mr Javier Solana said he held out 'scant hope' that there
would be a compromise over voting rights in the expanded Union when the EU
foreign ministers meet in Greece on Saturday.
He dismissed speculation that Spain, which has specific interests such as
the protection of Mediterreanean farm produce, would abandon the UK in what
has so far been a joint opposition to changes in the EU's current blocking
vote rules.
The UK's policy, which has in the past been at odds with Spain's
characteristic Euro- enthusiasm, is viewed as a more blanket opposition to
the decision-making process in Brussels.

FT  24 MAR 94 / Moscow committed to tough budget regime by IMF
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
International Monetary Fund assistance to the Russian government will commit
Moscow to tough budget discipline that could be difficult for the government
to maintain.
The IMF, which expects to release a Dollars 1.5bn loan soon, is banking on
the ability of Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the Russian prime minister, who has
impressed IMF officials, but who will be under extreme political pressure in
keeping Moscow's side of the bargain.
However, Mr Michel Camdessus, IMF director-general, reflected the Fund
team's recognition that the Russian government is already running a very
tight monetary policy, with real interest rates now standing at about 10 per
cent a month.
The commitments made by the government to obtain the second tranche of the
Dollars 3bn systemic transformation facility, to assist Russia in
restructuring its economy include:
Bringing down the monthly rate of inflation, presently at 10 per cent, to 7
per cent a month by December 1994.
introducing new taxes and improving tax collection.
Ensuring that all extra spending or loss of revenue will be compensated by
cuts in agreed spending programmes.
These commitments, coupled with the present tight monetary policy, mean that
the government has exceptional control over the economy. Industrial
production fell 24 per last month, compared to a year earlier, greatly
increasing political tension and fears of political upheaval.
However, Mr Camdessus said privately that he was extremely impressed by the
turnround in the central bank, whose officials he thought at least as
pro-reform as those in the more conventionally radical ministry of finance.
He managed to strike a warm acquaintance with Mr Victor Gerashchenko, the
bank head, who said after the signing of the agreement, 'allow me to give
you the congratulations of the world's worst central banker'.
This self deprecation was a reference to a description of him by Professor
Jeffrey Sachs, the former adviser to Russian ministers. Professor Sachs last
night said he was glad that the 'IMF has moved at last, but this is the last
moment to assist reforms'.

FT  24 MAR 94 / Gloom on jobs in Gloucestershire
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Gloucestershire has suffered the sharpest fall in overall employment in
Britain, a report on the county's economy by Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the
accountancy firm, shows.
It said the recession and cuts in the defence industry, on which the county
relies, meant unemployment nearly tripled between 1990 and 1993.
Industries which have grown rapidly in the 1980s, such as financial
services, have stalled. 'Almost all of the 20,000 net jobs gained in the
eight years between 1981 and 1989 were lost in the subsequent two years,'
the report says.
Coopers &amp; Lybrand did not expect the growth in the county's population and
labour force to be matched by employment growth.
Although unemployment is still below the national average, it forecasts
that, while the UK rate falls, there could be a further rise of 25 per cent
in Gloucestershire by 2002.

FT  24 MAR 94 / Camdessus gambles on Russia's unlikely reformist: How and
why the IMF chief made a Dollars 1.5bn deal with a prime minister whose
instincts are conservative
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michel Camdessus is taking the biggest risk the director of the
International Monetary Fund has ever taken. He is gambling on the ability of
the Russian prime minister to keep the country on a reformist course.
Mr Victor Chernomyrdin is a powerful premier. But he is also a man from
state industry whose instincts have been those of control, subsidy and
central planning. Has he really bitten the bullet of reform?
Mr Chernomyrdin wanted a meeting with Mr Camdessus very much. At the end of
last month, he turned for aid to Mr Peter Castenfelt, a wealthy financier
who chairs blue chip companies in the UK and elsewhere and who has a
company, Archipelago, which trades in Russia. His credibility with Mr
Chernomyrdin rests on the fact that he knows Russian business from the
inside.
Mr Castenfelt knew Mr Camdessus and senior officials in the World Bank and
undertook to take a message to them that the Russian prime minister wished
to prove he was serious about reform.
The message was delivered at the beginning of this month: once Mr Castenfelt
told Mr Chernomyrdin that Mr Camdessus was receptive, an invitation was
issued to him to come to Russia.
He came as IMF officials, led by Mr Ernesto Hernandez-Cata, were bogged down
in grinding, frustrating talks with Russian officials on the budget and on
reform. These were talks that seemed to confirm the worst fears of many in
the IMF that this was a government which could not manage the finances even
if it wished to.
Mr Camdessus began talks with Mr Chernomyrdin last Friday on a sour note, of
the kind which had marred their previous efforts in Washington to come to an
understanding. The Russian executive director of the IMF, Mr Konstantin
Kagalovsky - one of the few remaining members of the original Gaidar team
still in some sort of office - had given an interview to Reuters news agency
expressing his belief that a deal would be done. This kind of public
pressure, said Mr Camdessus, was not right: press relations must be better
handled.
The next day the two men disappeared on their own - to a hunting lodge at
Zavidovo, were Mr Camdessus, no great sportsman, was introduced to the joys
of the chase by the prime minister. (Richard Nixon had been similarly
inducted by Mr Leonid Brezhnev at the same spot 20 years before.) At that
meeting a mutual understanding began. However, in parallel discussions, the
IMF staffers and the Russian officials were still far apart, and the
estimations, especially from the Russian side, were pessimistic.
After further talks on Sunday, Mr Camdessus and Mr Chernomyrdin planned to
have a final session on Monday - a meeting billed as make or break. Instead,
Mr Chernomyrdin flew to the Black Sea resort of Sochi to see President Boris
Yeltsin, recuperating there from 'flu. He did so to explain to the president
what lay behind a rumour of a coup being organised against him and to get
the president's assent to a range of decrees which he would have to sign if
the agreement the prime minister wished to make with Mr Camdessus was to be
honoured.
He came back with assent. Late on Tuesday night the two men came up with a
deal that was not quite an agreement to pay the Dollars 1.5bn loan which was
the immediate goal of the talks, but was as close as Mr Camdessus thought he
could get.
It is a tough deal. The Russian government has agreed:
To hold the budget expenditure line at Rbs183trln - a line which the lobbies
are already attacking fiercely, with the military threatening unrest in the
army if their share is not raised. It has also agreed to raise revenue,
budgeted for Rbs120trln, by a series of measures which would involve extra
taxes and - crucially - a measure which would make at least some of the
existing spending programmes open to cuts if revenue fell below that
planned. By the end of this year, inflation should be running at no more
than 7 per cent a month, a rate lower than at any time in the past 27
months.
To finalise a statement on economic reform, which lays out the strategy for
the rest of the year.
To put before the lower house of parliament the legislation required to
bring in the changes in the budget, already before the house.
To sign the further measures needed which do not have to go before
parliament.
These moves are supposed to be completed by April 15. They will then be
examined by a committee of the IMF board and, if approved, Mr Camdessus will
recommend to the full board the payment of the Dollars 1.5bn.
IMF insiders in Washington say the deal is largely done: at least six of the
Group of Seven leading industrial countries are enthusiastic for the
agreement, with the US leading the way.
The risks are high. Revenue is to date far behind the projections and the
hard pounding is yet to come. Though Mr Camdessus has been enthusiastic
about the attitude of leading parliamentarians to the budget, parliament as
a whole has a majority conventionally seen as anti-reform.
The 'essence of this agreements depends on a personal relationship between
two men', said an official close to Mr Camdessus last night. 'He has taken a
huge risk, and he knows it.'
'Camdessus was between two cliffs,' said another official privy to the
talks. 'At the foot of one is written: you lost Russia. At the foot of the
other: you are a fool for believing Chernomyrdin. He preferred to take the
risk of looking like a fool.'

FT  24 MAR 94 / UK Company News: NFC sees viable recovery in UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits for NFC, transport and logistics group, increased by 45 per
cent to Pounds 28.3m in the 16 weeks to January 22, against Pounds 19.5m.
Turnover improved to Pounds 598.6m, compared with Pounds 557.4m, including
Pounds 9.2m from discontinued activities.
However the company said the profit had been enhanced by a compensation
payment of Pounds 3.5m for the cancellation of a property contract and a
pension credit of Pounds 8.7m, up from Pounds 6.9m last time. Underlying
growth in operating profits was 11 per cent.
The group, which is seen as a good indicator of economic activity, said the
UK economic recovery remained variable, while there were no signs yet of
recovery in Europe.
It added: 'The US offers better prospects. There are encouraging signs of
increasing activity throughout the logistics sector where the company's
sales pipelines are ahead of expectations.'
UK transport and logistics revenue increased by 5 per cent to Pounds 264m,
with operating profit increasing by 6 per cent to Pounds 16.5m. In the
grocery sector, revenue and margins were broadly in line with last year. The
industrial market remained difficult.
By contrast, the consumer and the automotive and petroleum and chemicals
sectors performed well.
'The integration of our UK logistics businesses is proceeding according to
plan although only limited restructuring costs have been incurred so far
with the bulk of the expenditure to be charged over the remainder of the
year.'
NFC said Lynx, its parcels operation, made further progress, reducing losses
from Pounds 3.8m to Pounds 2.6m in spite of a small decline in revenue .
Revenue in Europe rose 12 per cent to Pounds 52.1m and the small loss in the
first quarter was a slightly better result than last time.
Earnings per share rose to 3.6p (2.6p). The first interim dividend is raised
7.7 per cent to 1.4p (1.3p).

FT  24 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Devro at Pounds 18m and sees growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Devro International, the sausage casings maker which came to the stock
exchange last June, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 18m for the year to
the end of December, against Pounds 13.1m. Turnover was up from Pounds 82.7m
to Pounds 94.4m.
On a pro-forma basis, assuming the post-flotation capital structure was in
place, pre-tax profits rose 27 per cent to Pounds 25.6m (Pounds 20.1m).
Mr Leon Allen, chairman, said Devro was 'moving forward in a very
satisfactory manner, despite the worldwide recession'.
Mr Graeme Alexander, chief executive, said that half the sales growth of 14
per cent was due to windfall currency gains arising from the effect of
sterling's devaluation.
Sales volumes increased in Europe, the US and the Asia Pacific area, with
the South Korean market being particularly strong and expansion in Japan, he
added.
The company's new line in collagen film, used for coating hams, saw sales
rise to Pounds 4m.
Thanks to the float net borrowings of Pounds 69.2m at the beginning of 1993
were paid off. The company generated Pounds 27.9m in cash flow and had net
cash of Pounds 4.2m at the end of the year.
Devro said it expected to grow organically, especially in Asia, and to
profit from the introduction of new products, of which it gave no details.
'The time may be approaching to give careful consideration to acquisitions,'
the company added.
Earnings per share were unchanged at 10.5p or on a pro forma basis 14.8p
(10.5p). A final dividend of 4.17p is proposed.
Devro, based near Glasgow, is a maker of casings made from the edible
protein collagen, which is gradually gaining market share worldwide from gut
casings.
The company was floated after being acquired by its management from Johnson
&amp; Johnson.
COMMENT
The results reflect the quality of a company which grew steadily while
achieving greater efficiency and investing Pounds 3.5m in R&amp;D. It enjoys
high margins, faces no single competitor worldwide and its market is
protected by the high barriers to entry stemming from its technological
lead. Devro was floated at 170p and peaked at 294p as the market worked out
how to place it in the food manufacturing sector. Yesterday its shares fell
12 1/2 p to 244 1/2 p, apparently because of profit-taking on a bad day for
the market, but perhaps also because of nervousness about the build-up of
cash balances, which could hinder fast earnings growth. Analysts are
forecasting pre-tax profits for 1994 of between Pounds 28m and Pounds 30m,
suggesting prospective earnings of about 16.5p, putting the shares on a
multiple of 14.5. Given Devro's underlying strength and the undisclosed new
products in the pipeline the shares may be underpriced.

represents an exit yield of about 7 per cent. The proceeds will be used to
reduce debt.

Fairway Group, the USM-traded stationery and educational supplies
distributor, saw its share price rise 12p to 101p yesterday following an
optimistic statement at the annual meeting.

for the same period last year.

turnover of Pounds 42.3m. All the principal companies contributed to the
growth, excluding Fairway Business Forms.

FT  24 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Kingfisher doubts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Results from Kingfisher at the top end of analysts' expectations failed to
ease concern over trading in the UK businesses. The shares slipped with the
market, ending the day 9 down at 561p with turnover reaching 6.5m.
With business at Woolworth, Superdrug and B&amp;Q all proving disappointing,
Kingfisher's strategy of 'every day low prices' combined with cost cutting
and product innovation as a means of improving margins, divided analysts.
The more optimistic observers believe the group will emerge from the current
flat period in strong market positions. Others are not convinced, with one
analyst complaining that the company strategy kept promising 'but never
seems to deliver.'
All agree, however, that the crucial test for the short-term performance of
the shares will come in the next three weeks when the management embark on a
big series of presentations to insitutions and analysts.
A meeting between NatWest executives and bank sector analysts to explain the
rationale behind the acquisition of Citizens First, the US bank, appeared to
reassure the stock market and NatWest shares edged up 2 to 466p in a
generally dull sector.
TSB dropped 5 1/2 to 217p on heavy turnover of 8.3m shares, unsettled by an
agency cross at 215p. HSBC fell back from an early 804p to end the session
unchanged on balance at 783p. Standard Chartered closed 32 lower at 1074p
following what was described as a badly-handled selling order from one
agency broker.
Sharelink, the stockbroker, fell sharply, the shares slipping 29 to 325p
after some stock was sold into the market at 313p.
ICI was one of the few Footsie stocks to remain in positive territory the
shares benefiting from a Goldman Sachs recommendation and adding 5 at 811p.
Reuters Holdings improved 7 to 2048p on buying ahead of the share split in
April.
BAT Industries shed 10 to 459p after a US House sub-committee voted to raise
the Federal cigarette tax by Dollars 1.25 a pack to help finance a health
care reform bill.
Among leisure stocks, Thorn EMI and Rank Organisation were among the worst
hit. Dealers said that as well as being among the best performers in the
sector in recent months, last week's consumer spending figures had hit
sentiment. The shares retreated 24 to 1083p and Rank fell 17 to 398p.
Poor results from whisky group Burn Stewart sent the shares down to 129p.
Media stocks continued weak with United Newspapers which is to announce
full-year figures today, falling 24 to 636p, Pearson, which reports on
Monday, sliding 13 to 615p and Reed International losing 12 to 826p. Carlton
Communications, downgraded by Nomura slid 24 to 906p.
RPC eased 2 to 160p after announcing that Barclays Venture Nominees and
Railway Pension Venture Capital were behind the selling of a 6.7 per cent
stake in the group on Tuesday.
British Aerospace was among a handful of stocks that managed to resist the
market trend, the shares closing 1 1/2 ahead at 515p, on talk that the group
may benefit from increased tension between North and South Korea.
Korea is believed to have defence equipment on order from BAe and there were
suggestions that the orders may be brought forward.
A sharp increase in full year profits from engineering company TT Group
helped the shares jump 12 to 384p.

FT  24 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Lasmo steady
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Further heavy two-way business developed in Lasmo, the oil exploration and
production stock, after the group confirmed the market's long-held view that
the final dividend was doomed. Lasmo also announced big losses, heavy write
downs, more asset sales and hosted a poorly-received meeting with analysts.
The shares rose to 132p immediately following the results, which were
broadly in line with analysts estimates, but later fell sharply, dipping to
124p, with Smith New Court, the securities house said to have forecast a
drop in the shares to 100p. 'On fundamentals the shares are 20 per cent too
high,' said a Smith analyst.
By the close, however,the stock had rallied to 126p, a net fall of 2, with
US institutions, which already hold over 20 per cent of Lasmo shares, said
to have moved in to buy the stock. US investors view Lasmo as a BP-type
recovery play and focus on the company's cash flow.

</HEADLINE>

   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Selling ahead of half-year figures today sent shares in Wellcome, the
pharmaceuticals company down 22 to 601p after announcement of an EU inquiry.
The stock was already weak following a sharp sector sell-off in the US on
Tuesday prompted by news that Sandoz, the US group, was planning to slash
the price of a cholesterol treatment in order to gain market share.
However, the full hit came when dealers reacted to news of an EU inquiry
into its joint venture with Warner Lambert.
Analysts said the inquiry was routine and believed that the stock market had
overreacted and had also ignored news that Wellcome had obtained an option
to develop and market Glaxo's experimental compound 3TC for treating of
AIDS. Elsewhere in the sector, SmithKline Beecham lost 11 at 390p and Zeneca
13 at 740p.

FT  24 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Heavy trade in Glaxo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pharmaceuticals group Glaxo was the main casualty among leading stocks as
brokers reacted to shock news of a challenge to the company's headline drug.
By the close of dealing, the shares had fallen 40, or 6 per cent, to 622p.
The shares were also the most heavily traded in London - on turnover of 22m.
Worries over the apparent threat to Zantac, Glaxo's anti-ulcer treatment,
were sparked on Tuesday by news that an arm of Ciba-Geigy, the Swiss group,
hoped to launch a version of the drug in the US.
Zantac accounts for 43 per cent of Glaxo's sales and the threat to those
sales by a global player prompted Goldman Sachs and Smith New Court to
re-examine their views on the shares. Goldmans, already comparatively
bearish, cut its short term recommendation and said that although it was
holding its forecasts, 'the risk to these forecasts are now substantially
increased'.
Smith, formerly a buyer, turned to be being merely a short-term holder of
the stock. Other bullish analysts were also busy assessing positions. The
European pharmaceuticals team from UBS argued that the Ciba move could add
SFr500m (Pounds 231.4m) to company sales in 1996, which would hit Zantac
sales by 10 per cent.

FT  24 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The strong sell off in gilts led to a sharp turnaround of nearly 100 points
in stock index futures and pulled the cash market lower after UK inflation
data disappointed the market, writes Joel Kibazo.
Heavy selling of the June contract saw it close at 3,155, at parity with
cash but 10 points below its fair value premium to cash of around 10 points.
Volume was heavy reaching 23,989 contracts.
June had been strong earlier in the day. Having opened at 3,232, buying
mainly from independent traders (locals) saw the contract advance to the
day's peak of 3,246, just before 9.30am.
The announcement of the inflation figures brought a sharp retreat in gilts
and a reverse in June. It fell back in heavy selling, once again led by
independent traders, reaching a low of 3,149, a decline of 97 points from
its earlier peak.
The FT-SE June contract in the mid-250 closed at 3,802, but once again the
screen showed no turnover in the same contract on the OMLX.
It was expiry of the stock options in the Liffe traded options sector. Total
volume was 45,430 of which 17,465 was in the FT-SE 100 option and 4,166 in
the Euro FT-SE option. HSBC was the busiest stock option at 2,453 lots.

FT  24 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Heavy setback as interest rate hopes
dwindle - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Disappointing inflation data for last month badly upset the UK stock market
yesterday, reversing an initial attempt by London to follow other European
bourses in a favourable response to the latest developments in the global
interest rate drama. In early trading, the FT-SE Index was 23 points ahead,
encouraged by bond market firmness following the overnight statement from
the US Federal Reserve and then by a significant easing in repos rates at
the Bundesbank tender yesterday morning. But the FT-SE Index closed 46.2
down at a new low for the year of 3,155.3.
Both gilt-edged and equities went heavily into reverse at mid-morning on
news that the UK retail price index showed a 0.6 per cent gain last month,
against market expectations of an increase of only 0.4 per cent. The news
was interpreted as a severe blow to the already dwindling hopes for the cut
in UK base rates keenly sought by the stock market as a counter influence to
the increases in personal and VAT taxes which will hit UK consumers' pockets
next month.
Successive waves of selling in the stock index futures sector destroyed
share prices. Selling pressure increased towards the close as investors
weighed the likelihood that the credit tightening indicated on Tuesday by
the Federal Reserve will not be the end of the matter. Some London analysts
warned that Federal Funds Rate could move to 4 per cent, or even 5 per cent
in the near future.
During the second half of the session, London effectively separated itself
from the other European markets which were buoyed by hopes that their
domestic interest rates can be reduced under the lead of the Bundesbank. The
UK was seen as closer to the US in terms of economic cycle, with inflation
pressure not far away. Nervousness increased as both the stock and futures
markets fell through support levels and into what looked dangerously like
free fall territory.
At least one large London trading house was a heavy seller of the Footsie
index future yesterday, and pressures from the derivatives markets were
enhanced by a buy programme in equities in early trading. Traders stressed
that futures markets are now exerting even greater pressure on the
underlying stock market than that seen when share prices were rising.
Although the interest largely focused around the Footsie-listed stocks, this
afforded little protection to the FT-SE Mid 250 Index, which closed 27.9 off
at 3,825.2. Across the full range of the market, trading volume of 714.2m
shares was around 5 per cent up on the previous session, when retail, or
customer, business in equities returned a total worth of Pounds 1.56bn.
The stock market closed in a very subdued mood, with traders expecting
equities to remain nervous for the rest of this week, which will bring
important money supply data from Germany as well as unemployment claims
figures from the US. But the key to the stock market remains the government
bond sector, which proved again that it is itself highly nervous, and also
capable of outweighing any trends developed in the equity market.
Company features also turned less encouraging, with Wellcome falling sharply
ahead of the trading statement due today and Glaxo under further pressure.
However, Barratt Developments, the housebuilder, joined other companies to
have raised dividend payments this week.

FT  24 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (America): US stocks' revival in
response to Fed move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US stocks showed a modest improvement yesterday as investors sifted through
the implications of the Federal Reserve's move to tighten monetary policy,
writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 6.91 higher at 3,869.46, but the
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 slipped 0.27 to 468.53. In the
secondary markets, the American SE composite added 1.65 to 473.38, and the
Nasdaq composite 1.17 to 797.51. NYSE volume, at 281m shares, was moderate.
With the Fed's decision to push up rates out of the way, equity investors
were free to count their blessings, which include buoyant economic growth
and strong corporate profits. As a consequence, blue-chip stocks advanced
steadily during most of the session. In the last hours of trade, however,
the positive sentiment ebbed a bit and the Dow industrials gave back some of
their gains.
The day's economic news had the potential to unsettle the rosy mood. The
Commerce Department said the orders of durable goods last month slumped by
2.5 per cent, much worse than the consensus forecast of analysts, who saw a
half-point decline. However, investors chose to ignore the data, partly
because most of the decrease was concentrated in the aircraft sector,
limiting its negative implications for the economy as a whole.
The shift in attention away from interest rates was reflected in the
performance of stocks most expected to benefit from an expanding economy.
Caterpillar powered Dollars 2 1/4 ahead to Dollars 121, International Paper
climbed Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 70 3/8 and General Motors added Dollars
7/8 to Dollars 60 3/8 . Ford fared even better, jumping Dollars 1 7/8 to
Dollars 63 3/8 .
International Business Machines was a notable loser, thanks to reports
raising concern over the company's mounting debt-to-equity ratio. The stock
slumped Dollars 1 to Dollars 57 1/4 .
Trucking and air-freight delivery stocks were strong, lifting the Dow
transportation index by 10.59 to 1,725.01. Roadway Services gained Dollars 2
1/2 to Dollars 70 3/4 , while Airborne climbed Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 36
1/2 . But UAL, parent of United Airlines, sagged Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars
125 1/2 . In financial services, Lomas gained Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 9 1/8
on heavy volume of nearly 2.2m shares. The mortgage banking concern
disclosed that it would consider a merger or acquisition by another company.
Rubbermaid's share price fell Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 28 1/4 after its
chairman warned that the consumer-products company would fail to meet its
first quarter earnings projections of 35 cents a share.
Canada
Toronto stocks rocketed higher in late session trade, sending the TSE-300
index soaring to an all-time closing and intraday high. It rose 58.05 points
to 4,609.93 in brisk turn-over of 92.1m.
Gains were broad-based, which analysts cited as another positive sign that
market sentiment has turned. Advancing shares outpaced declines 503 to 316,
with 311 stocks closing steady, unmoved by the market.
Mexico
Mexican stocks ended moderately higher after a busy,speculative session
buoyed by a drop in domestic interest rates.
The IPC index of 36 leading shares closed 31.65 points higher, a gain of
1.26 per cent, at 2,543.57. Volume was brisk at 124.18m shares of which
Telefonos de Mexico accounted for almost 47m. Telmex A shares ended 1.89 per
cent higher.

Heavy profit-taking ahead of the March 31 book closing left the Nikkei index
1.4 per cent lower, for its fourth consecutive daily decline, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei lost 291.43 to 19,962.10, breaching 20,000 for the first time in
nine days. The index rose to a high of 20,322.03 in the morning session, but
steadily lost ground on profit-taking, hitting a low of 19,937.99 just
before the close.
Tuesday's plunge in the bond market triggered selling of equities by
investors hoping to cover losses on their bond portfolios. Traders expect
the liquidation by companies to continue throughout the week and predict
volatility up to the start of the new business year.
Volume rose to 400m shares from 370m. Foreign demand, which has supported
Japanese shares recently, subsided while domestic institutions,
arbitrageurs, corporations, and individuals were also sellers.
The Topix index of all first section stocks fell 13.59 to 1,614.42 while the
Nikkei 300 closed down 2.75 to 296.52. Declines led advances by 758 to 274
with 154 issues remaining unchanged. In London, the ISE/Nikkei index rose
2.225 to 1,334.00.
Pharmaceutical shares were weaker on reports that the health ministry had
instructed makers of interferon alpha, an anti-cancer drug, to issue
stronger warnings that it induces depression and suicidal tendencies. Takeda
Chemical Industries fell Y40 to Y1,250 and Fujisawa Pharmaceutical lost Y40
to Y1,160.
Hanwa, the steel trader which faces mounting debts as a result of
speculation on the financial markets during the late 1980s, fell Y54 to Y569
after the issue met heavy selling from a Japanese broker.
Large capital steels were down on profit-taking. Nippon Steel fell Y8 to
Y342 and Kawasaki Steel fell Y4 to Y365. Corporate selling also hit
high-technology stocks, with Hitachi down Y19 to Y950 and Toshiba down Y17
to Y773.
Speculative issues were higher in active trading. Sumitomo Coal Mining rose
Y45 to Y856 and Izutsuya gained Y25 to Y734.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 179.09 to 22,170.78 in volume of 157.2m
shares.
Roundup
The resolution of interest rate speculation in the US unleashed buyers
around the Pacific Rim. Karachi was closed for Pakistan national day.
HONG KONG climbed by 5 per cent although Jardine Matheson fell HKDollars
4.75 to HKDollars 49.25 before it was suspended from trading in the
afternoon.
Brokers said that the Fed's rise in short-term interest rates removed a key
uncertainty. Linking that to the view that the market was oversold,
institutions pushed the Hang Seng index up by 453.36 to 9,465.53, in
indicated turnover up from HKDollars 6.73bn to HKDollars 7.82bn.
Jardine group companies fell after Jardine Matheson, the parent, said that
it would cancel its local listing at the end of this year. Swire Pacific A
leapt HKDollars 5.50 to HKDollars 58.50 on a rush of switching orders.
BANGKOK put on another 4 per cent after the Thai bourse eased margin loan
regulations, triggering active bargain hunting by domestic investment funds.
The SET index closed 49.32 per cent higher at 1,286.44 in moderate turnover
of Bt7.4bn, the buying focusing on finance and communications issues.
KUALA LUMPUR credited retail buying and foreign funds as the KLSE composite
index closed just short of the 1,000 level, up 32.47 or 3.4 per cent at
999.95.
SINGAPORE noted late profit taking from both Hong Kong and London, but the
Straits Times Industrial index still ended 66.24, or 3.2 per cent higher at
2,111.28.
AUSTRALIA bought on the Fed news and on a sharp jump in local futures, the
All Ordinaries index ending 40.1, or 1.9 per cent better at 2,180.9.
On the Sydney futures market, the March share price index shot up 60 to
2,205.0 on short-covering. In the cash market, blue chip and resource stocks
reflected overseas buying in the morning, mainly from Asia, and domestic
institutional investment in the afternoon.
TAIWAN rose for the third straight day, helped by a rally in financials and
Hong Kong's recovery. The weighted index closed 69.43 up at 5,331.27 and
turnover rose by TDollars 10bn to TDollars 49.8bn.
BOMBAY's speculators sold to get out of overbought positions, the BSE index
closing 64.96 lower at 3,726.82.
The effect of the ban on the carry forward, or 'badla' system of trading,
was reinforced on Tuesday when the stock exchange declared a broker in
default.

FT  24 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): M3 scare hits bourses after
good start
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bourses had a good morning, but lost some of their gains later in the day,
writes Our Markets Staff. The turnround in sentiment coincided with
speculation on the forthcoming German M3 figures for February; scaremongers
were talking of a figure of up to 30 per cent although, said Mr Anthony
Thomas of Kleinwort Benson, the Bundesbank yesterday seemed to be steering
opinion into the 15 to 20 per cent area.
FRANKFURT extended the aggrandisement of German cyclicals as the Dax index
rose 19.79 to 2,161.13. Turnover rose from DM7.6bn to DM9.1bn.
The winners came mainly in carmakers, chemicals, steels and engineers.
Daimler rose DM13.50 to DM859.50, and to DM865 after hours. Bayer put on DM7
to DM388.50.
Mr Hans Peter Wodniok, of Robert Fleming in Frankfurt, said that indications
from companies and industry associations were that the German economy was
either at the bottom, or just past the bottom of the economic cycle. Car
orders in February, for example, have just shown a marginal pickup.
The immediate recovery prospect is reflected in a Dax 1994 p/e of 31 1/2 ,
falling to 22.8 on Fleming's 1995 forecast of a further 38 per cent rise in
earnings next year.
ZURICH was led higher by financials on the Fed's overnight moves and the
view that the sector's recent weakness had been overdone. The SMI index rose
32.3 to 2,857.0.
Drugs stocks were also at the centre of attention. Sandoz certificates rose
SFr60 to SFr3,920: US drugs stocks tumbled on Wall Street overnight amid
fears of a price war after news that the Swiss group's US subsidiary was to
sell its new cholesterol drug at about half the price of rivals.
Mrs Birgit Kulhoff at UBS commented that Sandoz was currently overshadowed
by Roche and was unjustifiably neglected by investors. She expected annual
earnings growth of 14 per cent over the next two years, compared with the
forecast sector average of 8-9 per cent.
The recently weak Ciba registered rose another SFr16 to SFr871 in continued
response to its US subsidiary's plans to market a rival to Glaxo's Zantac
anti-ulcer drug.
Among financials, UBS, the day's most active stock, rose SFr33 to SFr1,220,
CS Holding bearers SFr17 to SFr653 and SBC bearers SFr11 to SFr423.
PARIS saw the CAC-40 index at 2,225 level in early trading, before selling
set in ahead of today's end of the March account. By the close it was barely
changed, off 0.51 at 2,200.17, and turnover was slack at just FFr3.6bn.
One of the few performers was Societe Generale, up FFr7 at FFr650 ahead of
results due after the close on Friday.
UAP lost 90 centimes to FFr189 following its results earlier this week.
James Capel yesterday maintained its buy recommendation on the stock. The
brokers noted that restructuring at Banque Worms and a strong contribution
from foreign insurance operations led them to maintain a positive stance on
the insurer. 'However, after announcing that the group intends to launch a
capital increase in conjunction with the group's imminent privatisation, the
shares are likely to consolidate at current levels in the short-term'.
AMSTERDAM was supported by strong performances from the blue chips, and the
AEX index put on 1.05 at 415.38.
KNP BT, the paper manufacturer, which said that it expected a good result in
1994 after a 1993 net loss, rose initially to a session high of Fl 50.40
before falling off to close 30 cents ahead at Fl 49.90. The group added that
the performance would be dependent on European economic recovery.
Other strong performances were seen by the chemical groups, DSM and Akzo
Nobel, which improved respectively by Fl 3.80 and Fl 1.80 to Fl 126.10 and
Fl 224.80.
MILAN slipped back from a firm opening as profits were taken in some of the
recently strong industrial stocks. The Comit index rose 6.62 to 671.30.
Olivetti, still awaiting news on the granting of Italy's second cellular
telephone licence, fell L58 to L2,535: some analysts said that success was
already discounted in the share price. Fiat, leading the rival consortium,
slipped L21 to L4,978.
Telecoms were mixed, Stet adding L41 to L5,003 but Sip giving up L49 to
L4,384. Salomon Brothers commented that the restructuring of the industry
could take Stet shares as high as L6,900; the benefit from unification would
be significant and Telecom Italia would emerge as a new European leader. The
restructuring should also take Sip close to the L6,500 mark.
ISTANBUL declined by a further 8 per cent in reaction to the downgrading of
the country's debt by Standard and Poor's, the credit rating agency. The
composite index fell 1,171 to 13,667.
The country was also placed on credit watch, which suggested that its rating
may be lowered further.

FT  24 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets: Kenya equities enlivened by economic
reforms - But foreigners remain absent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nairobi's stock exchange has suddenly sprung to life, thanks to economic
reforms which have opened new horizons for the private sector in Kenya.
The NSE index of the 20 most traded shares has almost doubled since early
January: itbegan 1994 at the 2,500 mark, and soared to 5,115 in mid-February
before gliding down to the 4,700 level this week on a spate of
profit-taking.
Volume has increased five-fold in as many months and more than 200,000
shares have been traded every day this month so far, boosting daily turnover
to Ks15m (Dollars 230,000).
As a result of the share price explosion, Nairobi's stock exchange has
overtaken Egypt, Nigeria, Tunisia and Zimbabwe in terms of market
capitalisation. It is currently valued at Dollars 1.8bn, against an
estimated Dollars 1.4bn for Egypt, its closest regional rival.
It is almost too much excitement for the tiny bourse to bear. The NSE's
cramped offices in downtown Nairobi are packed with investors who come to
track the progress of their shares during the open-cry morning trading
sessions. Sometimes, the mayhem in the visitors' gallery is greater than on
the small trading floor, where six brokers conduct all the transactions.
Deals are recorded on a blackboard - computerisation, say NSE officials, is
still some years away.
Several factors have contributed to the trading revival. Over the past year,
the government has taken major steps to liberalise the economy: the shilling
was devalued and then floated last year; most foreign exchange controls have
been lifted; import licenses and price controls have been scrapped.
The reforms have radically improved the business environment for Kenyan
companies, particularly exporters. In addition, the banking sector enjoyed a
good 1993 owing to high interest rates and exceptionally high yields on
government bonds.
Mr Larry Sutcliffe of the Nairobi stockbrokers, F Drummond, says that
investors switched from bonds into equities when inflation, and therefore
interest rates, began to fall late last year. He also believes that
speculators bid up share prices in anticipation of the imminent entry of
foreign investment funds.
This has yet to happen. At present, direct foreign investors are free to
remit capital and dividends abroad. But foreign portfolio investors require
prior authorisation from the central bank and must channel their investments
through a local trust fund.
These restrictions have kept foreign investors at bay, although several
regional and emerging market funds are charting Nairobi's progress. Mr
William Chelashaw, who heads Kenya's capital markets authority, says: 'We
are confident the market will be opened up in time, but there is no
immediate rush to attract foreign capital'.
Most analysts believe that foreign funds are unlikely to invest on the NSE
until the market becomes considerably more liquid. 'At present, only about 3
per cent of distributed equity is traded,' says Mr Sutcliffe. 'Prices have
also risen because of the scarcity of stock'.
Price/earnings ratios have climbed to the mid-20s for the most actively
traded shares. This, say some brokers, is too high for a bourse which has
yet to catch the peripheral attention of emerging market funds.
The NSE is also narrow as well as illiquid. Of the 54 quoted companies,
eight, including three banks, account for almost 80 per cent of market
capitalisation.
But they have strong points, according to Middle Africa Investments, a local
company of financial advisers. It says: 'Quality management, multinational
support, low levels of debt and the growing importance of exports'.
BAT Kenya, the largest company on the NSE, has seen its share price rise
sevenfold during the past 12 months. Shares in Brooke Bond Kenya, a Unilever
subsidiary, have risen fourfold. Both companies are major exporters and have
benefited from the economic reforms.
The favourite financial stocks, such as Barclays Bank, Standard Chartered
Bank and Diamond Trust of Kenya, have also seen equity quadruple in value.
In spite of the NSE's recent decline, there is a sense of anticipation in
the air. The NSE will soon move to more spacious premises, which will be
enlivened by the addition of newly licensed brokers. The capital markets
authority says that it is determined to inject a little competition into the
brokerage business, in spite of much grumbling and resistance from the six
brokers who own the NSE at present.
Still to come are new rules to regulate the market, clarifying relations
between client and broker and between brokers. The CMA also wants to tighten
market surveillance and introduce more transparency into share transactions.
The entry of foreign investment funds could follow.
The IFC index of emerging markets has been held over this week.

FT  24 MAR 94 / Markets Report: Dollar fails to strengthen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar yesterday failed to rally despite the tightening of monetary
policy by the US Federal Reserve and a generous cut in the German repo rate,
writes Philip Gawith.
The US currency finished in London at DM1.685, down from its Tuesday close
of DM1.6885 before the Fed nudged up the fed funds rate by 25 basis points
to 3.50 per cent. The dollar is well below the DM1.76 level it traded at
shortly after the Fed tightened in February.
In Germany, the Bundesbank provided further evidence of a decoupling of US
and European interest rates when it announced an eight basis points cut in
the repo rate to 5.80 per cent.
The dollar also finished lower against sterling, closing at Dollars 1.4935
compared to Dollars 1.4862 on Tuesday. The pound was boosted by a poorer
than expected February retail inflation figure which set back expectations
of a cut in UK interest rates.
There was widespread concern in the market at the dollar's failure to rally
despite the favourable interest rate movements. Mr Brian Hilliard, senior
international economist, at SGST, said it seemed there was 'virtually no
circumstance that provides strength to the dollar.'
Others were less pessimistic about the US currency. Mr Paul Chertkow, head
of global currency research at UBS, said the market remained thin with 'the
long term players very much committed to the (long dollar) positions they
held at the beginning of the year.'
Sentiment against the dollar has soured following the currency's repeated
failure to make headway despite an interest rate differential moving in the
US's favour, and good growth prospects.
Dollar bears are certainly in the ascendancy at the moment. Swiss Bank
Corporation, for example, confirms that it is 'very comfortable' with its
forecast of the dollar at DM1.60 by the middle of the year. The SBC view is
that the dollar is weak because of a large current account deficit and
interest rates that are too low.
A spokesman said if the US currency went through DM1.67 by next Monday, a
large number of investors would be forced to rethink their positions.
'People who buy currencies because of growth are having to reconsider,' he
said.
Mr Chertkow says the dollar needs a catalyst to break from the levels where
it is currently 'languishing'. One candidate he suggests would be a package
of market-opening measures from the Japanese government. Another would be
the release of a good non-farm payroll number on April 1.
The UBS analyst added that in the absence of evidence of long-term investors
being frightened out of the dollar, he was happy to stand by the bank's
forecast of DM1.80 by mid-year and DM1.90 in December.
In the futures market Eurodollar contracts firmed showing a slight downward
revision of the pace at which Fed tightening is anticipated. The June three
month future rose by eight basis points to 95.68. The December contract was
nine basis points firmer at 94.84.
More encouraging for the dollar was that it managed to keep a firm tone
against the yen, despite a return to the offensive from US negotiators about
the trade dispute with Japan. The dollar closed in London at Y106.430 from
Y106.005.
The Bundesbank pleased the market with its generous repo cut, at the top end
of traders' expectations. The D-Mark held up well in Europe, finishing
unchanged against the French franc at FFr3.418 and the Belgian franc at
BFr20.64. The lira was slightly firmer against the D-Mark at L988.9 from
L990.4.
Euromark futures rallied after this news, but later lost ground when rumours
were rife about another bad money supply figure. The February M3 number will
be released later this week, and there was speculation that growth could be
as high as 30 per cent - well above the Bundesbank guideline.
The June contract settled one point lower at 94.50, with the December
contract seven points down at 94.88.
Call money was slightly easier at 5.70/5.80 per cent after the repo,
indicating the market view that interest rates will continue to fall.
In the UK, sterling had a better day as a poor inflation number scotched
talk of a rate cut. The headline retail price index rose 0.6 per cent in
February for a year-on-year rise of 2.4 per cent, compared with market
forecasts of 2.2 per cent.
It finished at DM2.5165 against the D-Mark from DM2.5094 on Tuesday.
In the futures market, sterling contracts eased across the yield curve
showing the market believes rates may be close to bottoming. The June
contract lost two basis points to 94.83 while the December future was seven
points lower at 94.39.
In the discount market, the Bank of England offered a Pounds 365m round of
late assistance after forecasting a fairly small shortage of Pounds 750m.
Analysts said the delay in clearing the shortage was probably the result of
banks holding back bills earlier in the day because of interest rate
speculation.

FT  24 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee futures retreat after
hitting fresh three-year highs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Coffee prices hit fresh three-year highs before retreating towards the close
at the London Commodity Exchange yesterday. The May futures position closed
at Dollars 1,347 a tonne, Dollars 17 off the peak and Dollars 5 down on the
day.
Some traders were concerned that coffee prices had risen too quickly and
were due for a correction. 'London is looking exceptionally over-bought:
it's a bit worrying,' said Mr Lawrence Eagles, coffee analyst at GNI, the
London brokerage house.
Prices have surged by nearly 15 per cent since the beginning of the year
after a tightening in supplies caused by some crop problems, rising
consumption and the effects of the producers' export retention scheme.
Stocks of coffee held by consuming countries dropped to 17m bags at the end
of January from 18.4m bags last October. Mr Eagles suggested there would be
a fairly steady draw down for the rest of the year to about 12m bags by
1995.
The drop in consumer stocks is one indication of the success of the
retention scheme set up by 40 producers in October. Producers agreed to
withhold 20 per cent of their supplies from the export market until prices
reached a predetermined level.
That level was almost achieved yesterday when the daily indicator price rose
to 74.88 cents a pound. When it gets to 75 cents producers will keep back
only 10 per cent. However, this prospect has largely been accounted for in
the recent move in coffee prices.
If the indicator rose by another 10 cents producers could begin releasing
stocks on to the market again. But that is some way off.
Producing and consuming nations came closer to agreeing a compromise on a
new International Coffee Agreement yesterday. The new pact could allow the
industry to negotiate economic clauses if the political will arose at some
stage in the future, but any economic provisions discussed would then have
to be incorporated into a new pact.
GNI has dramatically reduced its forecast for the deficit in this year's
cocoa crop from 241,000 tonnes to just 50,000 tonnes. But its says these are
largely accounting changes and that, with stocks reduced significantly by
the decision to liquidate the International Cocoa Organisation's buffer
stock, and crop output static, prices should still rise.
The brokerage house forecasts that the stock to consumption level will fall
below 30 per cent in the current crop year - the lowest level since 1977
when prices averaged nearly Pounds 3,000 a tonne.

FT  24 MAR 94 / World Commodities Prices: Copper rise meets resistance -
Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A late rise in the London Metal Exchange three months delivery COPPER price
above the Dollars 1,960-a-tonne resistance level was not maintained
yesterday as profit-taking and resistance trimmed gains. A high of Dollars
1,966 was reached before the price dropped back to Dollars 1,956, up Dollars
6 on balance.
Dealers suggested the failure to hold above Dollars 1,960 could signal a
retracement in the short term, but still thought prices were set to move
higher, given encouraging chart patterns and improving fundamentals.
ALUMINIUM held steadier in line with copper, although apart from some
short-covering and trade interest business remained slack.
NICKEL'S breach of Dollars 5,700 a tonne in late trading triggered stop-loss
buying orders and short-covering, which chased the market higher.
ZINC remained under pressure as its recent technical bounce lost momentum.

FT  24 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Argyle digs deep for precious
prizes - The world's biggest diamond producer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The massive, man-made Argyle dam is blood-red from the sandstone in the silt
carried to it by the Ord River after the wettest wet season experienced for
100 years in this remote region in the far north of Western Australia.
About half a metre of rain in the past month has washed out one of the roads
leading to the huge open pit at the Argyle diamond mine. But the weather has
not delayed a ADollars 100m project designed to ensure that Argyle remains
the world's biggest diamond producer into the next decade.
Argyle produced 7.9 tonnes of diamonds last year or 34 per cent of the
global total. However, as the pit goes deeper the deposit contains fewer
diamonds and Argyle has been spending so as to increase the tonnage of
material shifted each year - to about 40m tonnes.
This will give an extra 2m tonnes of ore (taking it to an annual 8.6m
tonnes) and should keep diamond output relatively constant for another seven
years. By that time the pit will have reached its maximum depth of 320
metres.
Argyle's diamond output is likely to rise a little this year and next before
falling back again in 1996, according to Mr Ron Bates, general manager,
operations.
By 1996 the pit's owners, CRA, the Australian affiliate of RTZ Corporation
of the UK, with 60 per cent, and Ashton Mining, about one-third owned by the
Malaysian Mining Corporation, will have to decide whether to build an
underground mine at the bottom of the pit. Mr Bates says Argyle has been
scouring the world for suitable low-cost underground mining methods but it
is far too early to say whether the scheme would be viable.
The partners' search for more diamond deposits nearby has drawn a blank so
far. The joint venturers spent ADollars 150m on exploration and feasibility
studies and then ADollars 475m to bring Argyle into production in 1985.
Since then the mine has produced about 40 tonnes of diamonds and given the
partners on average a handsome 30 per cent return on their investment.
Indications from the partners' annual results suggest that Argyle's output
last year was worth about ADollars 500m and produced an after tax profit of
about ADollars 100m for them to share.
Although Argyle ranks first in diamond output by weight, it is only sixth in
the world in the value of diamonds it produces. Some 5 per cent of the
diamonds from Argyle account for 50 per cent of its revenue while 50 per
cent are industrial stones of little value and produce only 5 per cent of
the revenue.
Mr Bates points out that in mining terms the industrial stones should be
seen as a by-product that must be extracted along with the mine's main
product. The remaining 45 per cent of the mine's output is of cheap gem
stones.
The key to Argyle's success, therefore, has been new technology that enables
it to sort billions of diamonds - many of them virtually worthless - a task
traditional sorting methods could not handle. CRA has developed a system
using X-rays to locate the diamonds in crushed ore - they glow in the beams
 -and then micro-computer-controlled machines blast air to blow each one out
of the material at a rate of up to 500 a second.

FT  24 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bank cleans up from gold
lending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bank of England is profiting greatly from the upsurge in gold bullion
lending, according to a study published today.
London is the dominant market for gold lending and for metal to be of
practical value to dealers it has to be located there. So those central
banks which are providing most of the bullion for lending have been moving
gold to the Bank of England for safe keeping. For this it makes a charge.
This trend has seen more than 500 tonnes of gold previously held by the US
Federal Reserve Bank in New York on behalf of other central banks moved to
London in the past few years, says Mr Ian Cox, author of the paper published
by the World Gold Council, a promotional body financed by gold mining
companies.
He suggests that the bullion lending market has trebled in the last ten
years to about 2,000 tonnes, equivalent to one year's supply from all the
world's gold mines. About 75 per cent of this is lent by between 45 and 50
central banks and other official monetary institutions. And they do it for
the money. Their net annual earnings from lending gold - which not long ago
was a non-earning asset - is between USDollars 100m and Dollars 140m.
Most of the gold is borrowed by miners to support hedging operations and to
finance exploration and extraction activities. All hedging operations need
the support of borrowed gold.
Mr Cox says the explosive growth in gold lending seen in the 1980s is
unlikely to be repeated but demand will continue to increase for the next
five to seven years. However, development might be slowed because several
financial institutions have withdrawn from gold trading, reducing the number
of counterparties likely to be regarded by central banks as acceptable.

FT  24 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indian jute faces stiff
challenge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   CALCUTTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Indian jute mill industry, which always has enjoyed a high level of
protection from the federal and state governments, fears that it is going to
lose a large part of the domestic packaging market to synthetic materials
following a recent revision of the duty structure.
The excise duty on traditional jute products like hessian, sacking and yarn
has gone up by 112 per cent with the government changing the levy from a
fixed Rs760 (Pounds 16.30) a tonne to 10 per cent ad valorem. At the same
time, the duty on synthetic bags has been reduced by 5 per cent to 30 per
cent. In addition the customs duty on polypropylene granules, the raw
material for synthetic bags, has been cut by 10 per cent to 65 per cent.
The duty on synthetic packaging material had always been kept high to give
protection to jute. According to the officials of the Indian Jute Mills
Association, following the duty revision, the price of a jute laminated bag
has gone up from Rs11.50 to Rs15 while that of a synthetic bag has fallen
from Rs8 to Rs7.75. As a result, the fertiliser industry, which packs nearly
50 per cent of its production in synthetic bags is expected to reduce
further the use of laminated jute bags.
In the meantime, the cement manufacturers, responding the demand of
consumers and lower prices of synthetic bags, have almost given up jute
bags. This is in spite of a government order, introduced in 1987, that
cement should only be packed in jute bags. The order also says that the
principal packing material for fertiliser should be jute. But the federal
government has let it be known that 'jute will not be given protection for
ever' and the user industries should have the freedom to decide which
packing material to use.
IJMA officials, who have been able to enlist the support of the government
of West Bengal, will entreat the federal government to restore the old duty
structure so that jute does not lose any more of the domestic market.
According to them, 'jute deserves special treatment since it supports over
4m farmer families and over 225,000 jute mill workers'.
After the setback in the cement and fertiliser sectors, the mainstay for
jute packaging material is foodgrains and sugar. But it is feared that once
sugar is packed in 50 kg - the International Labour Organisation made a
recommendation to this effect a long time ago - synthetics may become the
preferred packaging material for sugar. As synthetic bags cannot hold 100 kg
of sugar, the commodity is now exclusively packed in jute bags.
While the industry was facing a crisis in the domestic market, its exports
in the nine months to December 1993 rose to 158,024 from 137,778 tonnes in
the corresponding period of the previous year. Export earnings from jute
goods during the period increased to Rs2.77bn from Rs2.37bn.

FT  24 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Germany sets scientist to work
on BSE threat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LINDEMANN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The German government yesterday announced the launch of a new research
project to examine whether the cattle disease bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE) can be transmitted to human beings.
The initiative comes as the country is pushing for a European Union ban on
British beef imports, arguing that there is still no conclusive evidence
that the disease cannot affect humans.
Seven German universities and research institutes will be sponsored by the
country's research and technology ministry to examine possible connections
between the origins of BSE and two other diseases, Creutzfeldt Jakob disease
and Gerstmann Straussler syndrome, which very rarely affect humans.
Several German scientists have expressed concern that BSE - popularly known
as 'mad cow disease' because of the way it debilitates the brains of cattle
 -may be transmissible to humans who eat contaminated beef or take medicines
made with ingredients from contaminated animals.
'The danger that BSE can be transmitted to humans is minimal or
non-existent,' said Professor Hans Kretzschmar from Gottingen University.
'However, we do not know that it is non-existent. I personally think
(British beef) should not be imported.'
Contaminated British beef will be discussed at a meeting of EU health
ministers on March 30, but a German official said that any decisions about a
ban would be made by the union's agriculture ministers, who were likely to
argue that existing safeguards were sufficient.
In 1992, the last year for which figures are available, Germany imported
2,092 tonnes of British beef - 2 per cent of all its beef imports from other
EU countries - and 13 tonnes of veal.
The research ministry said that more than 100,000 cattle had died as a
result of catching BSE in Britain. A further 50 cases of the disease had
been recorded in Switzerland and there were two known cases in Germany, one
of which affected a cow imported from Britain.

FT  24 MAR 94 / Government Bonds: Money supply speculation sends bunds into
tail-spin
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Wild rumours that German M3 numbers for February would show an annualised
increase of 30 per cent sent government bonds there into a tail-spin
yesterday, dragging other European markets with them. The figures are due to
be published today or tomorrow.
The bund market got off to a shaky start following articles in two German
newspapers suggesting that market expectations of an annualised rate of
around 15 per cent for German M3 were too optimistic. They said the figure
was more likely to be between 17 and 20 per cent.
Bunds then drew some temporary comfort from the Bundesbank's widely-expected
decision to reduce the repo rate by eight basis points to 5.8 per cent, and
from the publication of reasonable inflation data for the month to mid-March
from North Rhine-Westphalia and Baden-Wurttemberg.
However, towards the late afternoon market fears of another poor M3 number
weighed heavily on prices.
The June bund future on Liffe fell from the day's best level of 97.05 to
trade at 96.26, down 0.24 points on the day but off the day's low of 96.18.
Analysts say they would prefer to see an outlandish figure, because this
would make a laughing stock of the Bundesbank's policy of targeting
medium-term money supply.
'In a way, 30 per cent would be less severe than 18 per cent . . . because
it would hail the death of M3 as a target,' said Mr Klaus Baader, senior
international economist at Lehman Brothers in London.
However, he said a number above 16 per cent would damage the market, since
it would cast serious doubt on the Bundesbank's assertions of tax-related
special factors to explain the poor numbers in January.
Mr Julian Callow, European economist at Kleinwort Benson, said a number
higher than last month's 21.2 per cent would also damage the market's
fragile confidence.
The publication of disappointing inflation data for February depressed UK
government bonds yesterday morning.
The larger than expected rise dampened hopes of an early cut in interest
rates, dealers said.
The June long gilt future on Liffe fell on the day to 109 3/16 after an
intra-day high of 110 15/16 and a low of 108 29/32 .
Gilt prices then fell further in the afternoon as anxiety spilled over from
continental Europe. However, activity was fairly limited.
French government bonds performed slightly better than their European
neighbours', buoyed by hopes of a cut in the intervention rate by the Bank
of France today. Some analysts were forecasting a cut of between 10 and 15
basis points in the rate, which currently stands at 6.10 per cent.
However, others said a widening in yields and a weakening in the French
currency, which reflected investor fears on industrial action, gave the Bank
of France little scope to cut rates. The June contract on the French 10-year
notional bond on the Matif eased 0.2 points to 123.92, in the middle of the
day's trading range of 124.14 to 123.84.
Uncertainty over the outcome of this weekend's general election kept Italian
government bonds on tenterhooks. Traders reported that a private poll
suggested the two big groups on the left and the right were likely to catch
an equal amount of votes, which would effectively create a stalemate.
The June Italian government bond future on Liffe traded slightly higher in
the late afternoon, standing 0.10 points up at 110.39, but off the day's
best level of 111.14.
US Treasury bonds slipped yesterday as the market gave up some of the gains
it registered on the heels of the Federal Reserve's move to tighten monetary
policy.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  3/8 lower at
92 1/16 , with the yield rising to 6.877 per cent. At the short end, the
two-year note was off  1/32 at 100 5/32 , to yield 5.025 per cent.
The implications of the Fed's new policy dominated activity. Trading was
subdued in the aftermath of Tuesday's move to nudge up the key Fed Funds
rate - at which banks make overnight loans to one another - by 25 basis
points to 3.50 per cent. The central bank's decision to lift the Fed Funds
target was confirmed in the morning, when it allowed the market's prevailing
rate to stand at 3.50 per cent.
The day's economic news, though appearing to be favourable, elicited little
response. The Commerce Department said orders of durable goods last month
slumped 2.5 per cent, against expectations of a half-point decline. Most of
the big drop, however, was attributed to flagging orders of aircraft,
limiting the impression of a significant slowdown in economic growth.
Earlier, prices across the yield curve improved modestly. By late afternoon,
however, bonds reversed course and drifted lower despite a fairly good
reception for the Treasury's auction of Dollars 11bn in new five-year notes.
The issue was awarded at a yield of 5.91 per cent, as expected. On a
when-issued basis, the five-year security was trading at a yield of 5.943
per cent soon afterwards.

FT  24 MAR 94 / International Bonds: French issuer braves unsettled
conditions with Ecu deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Only a handful of deals emerged yesterday, as bond market conditions remain
unsettled. Dealers said supply of new issues would remain thin until markets
showed strong signs of consolidation at these levels.
Credit Local de France, the French local government agency, launched the
first Ecu bond offering for over a month, via Credit Lyonnais.
The Ecu150m seven-year deal is priced to yield 8 basis points more than a
comparable issue by the European Community, according to the lead manager.
Other dealers, however, said the issue looked rather expensive compared with
seven-year paper launched earlier this year.
There has been a slight pick-up of interest in Ecu bonds in the last week or
so, causing real 10-year Ecu yields to tighten to 10 basis points below the
theoretical Ecu yield, according to traders. Having started the year at 25
basis points below, Ecu bonds then suffered a bout of weakness which left
them trading flat to the theoretical yield.
Although the market is receiving some support from the large amount of Ecu
bonds maturing, dealers said many investors, especially institutions, were
not reinvesting in Ecu bonds.
However, some retail investors are buying more Ecu bonds - with Ecu1bn
maturing in April, this could spark further new issues.
In the lira sector, Deutsche Bank Finance launched a L500bn 10-year issue of
zero-coupon bonds, priced at 42.15 to yield 9.02. Lead manager Deutsche Bank
London said the yield was substantially higher than for most outstanding
zero-coupon deals, which are trading at about 8.40 per cent. The deal was
quoted at 42.15 bid, the same level as the re-offer price.
Standard &amp; Poor's has confirmed the AA - long-term credit rating of Bank of
Nova Scotia, which had been placed on CreditWatch with negative implications
in December.
Japan Credit Rating Agency said it would assign a bbb rating to samurai
bonds issued by the Republic of Turkey. The rating will affect a total
Y485bn. The bonds were issued between June 24 1992, and March 1 1994.
JCR is also placing the Government of Turkey under credit monitor. Turkey's
economic performance has deteriorated rapidly since the devaluation of the
Turkish lira.

FT  24 MAR 94 / International Capital Markets: Simex settles in to niche
market - The Singapore exchange has renewed links with the CME
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The advent of global electronic futures trading, the growth of Japanese
derivatives exchanges, and the ballooning over-the-counter market in Asian
securities has done little to dent the success of the Singapore
International Monetary Exchange (Simex).
Last week Simex, conceived 10 years ago as a vehicle for the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange to deliver financial futures contracts to the Asian time
zone, renewed its partnership with the CME and won the rights to trade
futures on a prized Japanese stock index.
At the same time, Simex officials are negotiating a co-operative trading
arrangement for crude oil futures and options with London's International
Petroleum Exchange, and are in talks with other derivatives exchanges in
Europe and North America to share Simex's trading window into Asia.
Simex was the first financial futures exchange in Asia, the first Asian
exchange to trade energy derivatives, the first exchange in the world to
trade Japanese stock index futures, and the only exchange to agree that
trades made on its floor could be offset on another exchange in a different
time zone.
This last arrangement, called mutual offset, was renewed last week between
the Simex and the CME for another five years. The fact that the arrangement
survived despite the CME's aggressive backing of Globex, the international
electronic futures trading system, provided proof that the open outcry
method of trading is still preferred by many traders.
As part of the renewal agreement, Simex officials will support the entry of
Globex terminals into Singapore. In Florida last week for the Futures
Industry Association conference, Mrs Elizabeth Sam, Simex president, seemed
little worried by the prospect of electronic competition. 'We have learned
from our own experience that the open outcry system is a better system,' she
said.
Although neither exchange releases statistics, industry sources estimate
that 2.5m Eurodollar futures traded under the mutual offset pact between
Simex and the CME last year. In 1993, Simex traded 15.7m contracts.
Eurodollar futures, with a turnover of 5.5m, was its largest contract.
The Simex mutual offset arrangement generates far more volume for the CME
than Globex. Recently, the CME decided to pump up its volume figures by
counting Simex mutual offsets. This made Simex an important factor in the
CME's struggle to hold its place as the world's second busiest futures
exchange, behind the Liffe.
Simex's second-largest contract is the Japanese Nikkei 225 stock index
future, with volume in Singapore growing at the expense of the Osaka
Securities Exchange. Last year's poor stock market performance in Japan was
blamed in part on suspected manipulation of the Nikkei 225 futures traded in
Osaka. That forced higher margin and commission rates, making Singapore a
cheaper place to trade.

Mycom, the listed Malaysian gaming and property company, is moving into the
timber business in the east Malaysian state of Sabah with the acquisition of
UNP Plywood, one of the state's biggest timber operators.
Mycom will be paying MDollars 350m (USDollars 130m) for UNP through the
issue of 70m new Mycom shares at MDollars 5 each.
UNP has an extensive timber mill operation in Sabah and several thousand
hectares of valuable timber concessions. Many big Malaysian companies have
announced plans to invest in Sabah following the recent transfer of power in
the state to parties aligned to the ruling coalition headed by Dr Mahathir
Mohamad, the Malaysian prime minister.
Mycom is rapidly expanding its activities. Earlier this year it announced
that, along with Indonesian interests, it was taking a stake in Lamborghini,
the Italian sports car manufacturer. Mycom had pre-tax profits of MDollars
85m in the six months to end-1993.

<TEXT>
Jardine Matheson, one of Hong Kong's oldest trading conglomerates, yesterday
attempted to deflect attention away from its planned de-listing from Hong
Kong to its 23 per cent rise in net profits to USDollars 388.8m last year,
up from Dollars 316.8m in 1992.
Mr Charles Powell, director, said yesterday: 'Jardines will be judged not by
where it is listed but by its results, and the results announced today are
excellent.'
Analysts fought shy of the term 'excellent', saying the results, while
strong, were broadly in line with expectations.
Earnings were lifted by a strong performance at Jardine Fleming, the Hong
Kong merchant banking joint venture between Jardine Matheson and Robert
Fleming, the UK merchant bank.
On Tuesday, Jardine Fleming reported a 166 per cent leap in net profits to
USDollars 202m, half of which accrues to Jardine Matheson.
Jardine Fleming contributed a 26 per cent slice of total net profits,
compared with 12 per cent in 1992. Conversely, the contribution from Jardine
Pacific, the trading and services arm, slumped to 42 per cent from 50 per
cent the previous year.
Mr Nigel Rich, managing director, attributed the fall to poor results from
Japan and a disappointing performance on the shipping side.
Geographically, the biggest upturn came from south-east Asia, where net
profits rose to Dollars 57.2m from Dollars 21.5m the previous year. Earnings
from Hong Kong and China improved at a much more modest rate, up to Dollars
224.3m from Dollars 207.2m.
Mr Henry Keswick, chairman, said: 'Jardine Matheson's particular strength is
in the Asia-Pacific region, which remains the world's prime growth area, but
the group also has extensive investments elsewhere, which hold promise for
the future.'
Total turnover climbed by 7 per cent to Dollars 84bn, from Dollars 7.9bn the
previous year. Fully diluted earnings per share rose by 21 per cent to 66.31
cents from 54.59 cents. Net asset value per share increased by 34 per cent
to Dollars 4.66.
The directors will recommend a dividend of 15.20 cents per share which gives
a total payout of 22 cents. This represents an increase over 1992 of 18 per
cent.

FT  24 MAR 94 / International Company News: Banking shake-out heralds new
era - The former chief of the Bank of Tokyo talks to William Dawkins
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's banking system is on the threshold of a shake-out in which some
weaker players will be forced to merge, but from which the larger ones could
emerge strengthened.
That is the assessment of one of the industry's most experienced operators,
Mr Yusuke Kashiwagi, 76-year-old senior adviser and former chairman of the
Bank of Tokyo. The banking system is only just beginning to face up to the
lessons of the collapse of the sharp rise in property and share prices of
the late-1980s, fuelled by its own intemperate lending, he says.
The largest banks will in the next few years complete their retrenchment. On
the back of a recovery in the Japanese economy, they will relaunch
themselves as big international competitors, says Mr Kashiwagi, defying the
gloomier commentators.
'Over the next 10 years, the Japanese economy will be a good performer.
Labour will be available and productivity will go up. There will be plenty
of savings, interest rates will rise, inflation will be low, which means we
will have a strong currency. We will have growth with stability and this
means that Japanese banks will once more go into international business in a
big way,' he explains.
A related development will be the continued gradual breakdown of the
Japanese banking industry's uniquely segmented structure, Mr Kashiwagi
predicts.
Larger banks appear to be well on the way to running down the bad debts
inherited from the 1980s bubble, but this is not so for the smaller regional
institutions and agricultural co-operative banks.
'We financed the bubble. Maybe it could have been avoided,' says Mr
Kashiwagi.
'One culprit was the tremendous competition in the banking system, which
meant we were not as careful as we should have been in screening loan
applications.'
Most banks are still struggling with the problem of providing for the bad
assets inherited from the bubble days, though the Bank of Tokyo was less
affected than most, if only because it was too busy tackling bad sovereign
loans made to developing countries to get drawn into the lending rush.
As part of this, most Japanese banks are now working hard to slim costs,
through staff reductions and organisation changes. The big danger, Mr
Kashiwagi warns, is that banks will be lulled by Japan's low interest rates
into restructuring less toughly than they should. Falling rates reduce the
cost of carrying bad loans. 'This is an opportunity and one must be sure to
benefit from it, not to dissipate the gains,' he says.

FT  24 MAR 94 / International Company News: Wharf advances 33% in year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE LUCAS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wharf (Holdings), the Hong Kong conglomerate controlled by the family of the
late Sir YK Pao, yesterday reported net profits for 1993 of HKDollars 2.7bn
(USDollars 349m), up 33 per cent on the previous year's HKDollars 2bn.
The earnings, which were broadly in line with market expectations, included
an exceptional item of HKDollars 589.3m on the sale of investment properties
and were fuelled by a combination of a swollen property bank and rising
rental fees. Taken on a per share basis, earnings rose 30 per cent to 127.3
cents, compared with 97.8 cents in 1992.
Wharf's total asset base rose to HKDollars 100.5bn, representing a
year-on-year increase of HKDollars 41.2bn. The net asset value per share
rose 70 per cent to HKDollars 36.37.
Some 75 per cent of profits came from the property side last year, and Mr
Peter Woo, chairman, said new developments coming on line would fuel further
growth this year.
Mr Woo said: 'We are talking about 6m square feet of new space in Hong Kong
of which profits have not accrued to previous financial reports and which
has estimated future rental billings of close to HKDollars 2.5bn. 1993
profits came in at HKDollars 2.7bn, so with the three properties - Times
Squares and Phases I and II of The Gateway - coming on stream, we are almost
doubling the profit we are now able to generate, based on present profit
generating assets.'
Of the remaining core businesses, about 21 per cent came from transport
infrastructure, mainly terminals, and the balance was split between hotels
and, to a lesser extent, investment income.
Mr Woo estimated Wharf Cable would be piped to 1.2m homes by the end of the
year, at which time viewers will be able to tune into 20 channels.
Directors are proposing a dividend of 66 cents, for a total annual payout of
85 cents, an increase of 31 per cent over the 1992 dividend of 65 cents.

Cathay Pacific Airways, the Hong Kong airline controlled by Swire Pacific,
is to acquire a 75 per cent stake in Air Hong Kong, an air freight carrier
based in the colony, from Shun Tak Holdings, the Macao jetfoil, property and
restaurants group.
The purchase remains subject to a due diligence review.
Cathay Pacific plans to run the business as a stand-alone operation, similar
to the Dragonair model.
However, there will also be economies of scale in areas such as maintenance,
marketing and route planning.
Air Hong Kong currently leases a fleet of three Boeing 747 freighters.

Mayne Nickless, the Australian transport and healthcare group, is selling
its 50 per cent interest in Freightways Group, the New Zealand-based
transport venture, in a deal thought to be worth around ADollars 40m
(USDollars 28.4m). The buyer is Freightways Holdings, the other half-owner
of the company.
Mayne did not put a price on the deal but said the total consideration was
'slightly in excess of the company's investment'. In its last accounts, at
mid-1993, the book value was ADollars 37.2m.
Freightways Group takes in 15 separate businesses including transportation
operations New Zealand Couriers and Poste Haste, and the Armourguard
Security, armoured transport business.
The sale means the Australian company will have withdrawn from the New
Zealand market, where it has been a force since the 1930s. Mayne stressed
that this was not because of dissatisfaction with Freightways' performance,
but reflected a desire to concentrate on markets with 'greater growth
potential'.

<TEXT>
Fortex, the New Zealand company credited with leading the way in the reform
of the country's meat processing industry, was yesterday placed in
receivership by a group of trading banks.
Talks about the company's financial problems began last week, following a
statement that the company expected to lose up to NZDollars 50m (USDollars
28.5m) in the six months to February 28 because of intense competitive
pressures in the meat industry.
The failure of the company is an embarrassment for the government, which had
extolled the virtues of its having the latest plant and machinery, new
marketing technology and cost-saving union agreements at its two plants.
Fortex had also been one of the darlings of the New Zealand Stock Exchange.
The shares traded as high as NZDollars 2.65 in 1992 before falling to
NZDollars 1.00 earlier this month and to only 6 cents at the close of
trading last night.

FT  24 MAR 94 / International Company News: Wal-Mart to supply Japanese
chain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY and EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wal-Mart, the leading US discount retailer, and Ito-Yokado, a large Japanese
supermarket chain, have reached an agreement under which Wal-Mart will
supply its own-brand products to the Japanese retailer.
The move comes as an increasing number of Japanese retailers are
diversifying product procurement, especially from overseas, due to the
growing preference of consumers for cheaper discounted goods.
Such strategies among leading supermarket and discount chains are expected
to prompt a further shift of retailing power from the national brand
manufacturers, which until recently have controlled retail prices of
products, to retailers.
For Wal-Mart, the agreement to supply Ito-Yokado is the first of its kind,
according to analysts, who say overseas markets represent a small but
increasingly important segment of the company's business.
The deal highlights a wider trend in Japan. The country's old-fashioned
distribution and retail system, which has been controlled by manufacturers
and wholesalers, is facing modernisation due to deregulation, and the rise
of discount retailers and large supermarket chains which are creating their
own production and procurement networks.
Aoyama Trading, a leading men's suits discounter, this week announced it
would tie up with JC Penney, the US department store chain, to sell its
casual wear in Japan, while Yaohan, the Japanese retail and distribution
chain based in Hong Kong, will also market Wal-Mart's items in Asia.
Although the Ito-Yokado deal is one of Wal-Mart's first forays outside North
America, the expansion-minded company has been active in Canada and Mexico
over the past year.
The Arkansas-based retailer, which rang up total sales of Dollars 67bn in
the year to January 31, recently announced an agreement to acquire 120
Woolco discount stores in Canada from Woolworth, giving the chain a strong
footing north of the border in a single transaction.
In Mexico, Wal-Mart is opening a string of warehouse clubs and discount
stores in a joint venture with Cifra, the country's largest retailer.
Mr Saul Yaari, managing director of Piper Jaffray, a Minneapolis securities
house, downplayed the significance of the Japanese deal and the extent to
which Wal-Mart will pursue expansion and supply links with retailers outside
North America.
'I assume they will dabble overseas, but their plate is full in the US,' Mr
Yaari said, pointing out that the company was focusing on new 'superstores'
 -combining groceries and general merchandise - in its domestic market.
A spokesman for Wal-Mart declined to comment on the Japanese agreement.
For its part, Ito-Yokado will provide Wal-Mart with its sophisticated
point-of-sales technology, which helps efficient product and shelf
management. The two companies are to develop jointly low-cost products and
co-operate in expanding sales networks in Asia and Europe.

Seagram, one of the world's leading drinks groups, said the recession in
several key markets hurt operating results for the year ended January 31,
but its performance in the US, Germany, Asia and Latin America strengthened
significantly.
Net income was USDollars 379m, or Dollars 1.02 a share, against a loss of
Dollars 900m, or Dollars 2.38, a year earlier, which included a special
charge of Dollars 1.374bn, or Dollars 3.64, reflecting accounting changes
stemming from its investment in Du Pont, the US chemical group.
Excluding the accounting changes and other one-time charges by 24.5 per
cent-held Du Pont, Seagram's net income was Dollars 1.75 a share, against
Dollars 1.61.
Seagram, controlled by the New York and Montreal Bronfmans, reported sales
and other income from its drinks business of Dollars 6.04bn for the year,
against Dollars 6.1bn last time.
Its Tropicana juice subsidiary showed a 19 per cent gain in operating profit
to Dollars 102m.
Fourth-quarter net income from the drinks and dividends equalled 45 cents a
share, against 46 cents, while sales were little changed at Dollars 2bn.
Results from Absolut Vodka, for which Seagram recently bought marketing
rights, were not included.
Earlier this month, Seagram raised its holding in Time Warner, the US
multimedia giant, to 13.2 per cent.

6.6m

<TEXT>
Mr Dennis Weatherstone, chairman of JP Morgan, the US bank, was paid Dollars
6.6m last year, a rise of 45 per cent on 1992 and an echo of other big pay
rises in the US financial sector announced recently.
Morgan said Mr Weatherstone's remuneration, in the form of Dollars 3.1m cash
and Dollars 3.5m of restricted shares, reflected the bank's 'very strong
earnings' during 1993.
The New York-based institution, one of the most profitable commercial banks
in the country, made after-tax earnings of Dollars 1.73bn, up from Dollars
1.13bn the year before.
The British-born Mr Weatherstone, who has headed the bank since 1990, was
paid a base salary of Dollars 700,000, with the rest of his income linked to
performance.
Among other high-paid bank chairmen, Mr John Reed of Citicorp received
Dollars 6.2m, nearly three times his remuneration the year before, while Mr
Dan Tully, chairman of Merrill Lynch, received Dollars 9.6m, a rise of 30
per cent.
US financial companies benefited last year from favourable financial
markets, a beneficial interest rate environment and the effects of a
gathering recovery in US economy.

from Chapter 11
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RH Macy, the US department store group, has revealed details of a plan
designed to lead it out of Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection by January.
The package, agreed by Macy's board a day earlier and submitted for review
by Mr Cyrus Vance, the court-appointed mediator, is a compromise between
secured and unsecured creditors, who clashed over the terms of the proposal.
However, the future of the New York-based retailer remains uncertain.
Federated Department Stores, a long-time rival of Macy's and one of its
biggest secured creditors, has proposed a merger between the two groups.
Fidelity Investments, which holds Dollars 490m in Macy's debt, suggested
that it was dissatisfied with the proposed reorganisation plan, which may
lead it to abandon its support for Macy's independence.
Under the proposals, Macy's creditors would initially receive a total return
of Dollars 3.6bn on their claims, including Dollars 2.1bn in cash and debt,
and Dollars 1.5bn in equity in the reorganised company. However, the plan
also calls for an additional Dollars 500m to be distributed in July 1997 if
the value of Macy's stock appreciates to at least Dollars 2.2bn, or by about
47 per cent, before that date.
The two-stage valuation was a concession by Macy chairman, Mr Myron Ullman,
to a dissent faction on its 11-member board. Mr Ullman, supported by two of
Macy's biggest secured creditors, Fidelity Investments and GE Capital, had
originally proposed a Dollars 3.5bn value on the company.
A second board group, led by Mr Laurence Tisch, chairman of Loews and CBS
and one of Macy's biggest bond holders, had backed a plan which suggested a
valuation of at least Dollars 3.8bn.
The higher valuation would provide a greater return on the claims of
unsecured creditors, including public bondholders and trade suppliers, which
would be paid only after claims secured against real estate and other Macy's
assets were satisfied. The more senior class of creditors is owed Dollars
2.4bn, plus interest.

Visa

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MasterCard International made further inroads last year into the dominant
market position of its bigger rival, Visa International, as the transaction
volume handled by the payment system rose 28.1 per cent.
The increase to Dollars 320.6bn was driven partly by its earlier entry into
co-branded credit cards. Last week Visa reported a 16.9 per cent gain in
volume last year, to Dollars 542.2bn.
The marked difference in the two organisations' growth rates means that,
while Visa remains the leading international payment system, MasterCard's
volume has risen to 59 per cent of its rival's, compared with 54 per cent in
1992.
Speaking at MasterCard's annual meeting in New York, outgoing chairman Mr
Pete Hart said the growth had come from a focus on providing better value to
cardholders.
The battle for market share among credit-card companies in the 1990s has
turned largely on the benefits for using cards, such as free air tickets.
In the US, which accounted for some 43 per cent of each group's volume last
year, MasterCard volume rose to Dollars 139.1bn, a gain of 23.4 per cent,
while Visa increased to Dollars 229.9bn, a rise of 18.2 per cent.
Mr Peter Dimsey, head of the US region, said MasterCard's operations there
had been 'revitalised' by its involvement in co-branding and developing
point-of-sale debit cards.

FT  24 MAR 94 / International Company News: Trizec given warning by senior
debt holders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Senior debenture holders of Trizec, the biggest property company in the
Edper-Hees group, have warned they will move quickly to take control if
agreement on recapitalisation is not reached by March 31.
Mr Derek Tay, spokesman for the debenture holders, said Trizec's proposal to
negotiate a CDollars 600m (USDollars 429m) third-party equity infusion by
March 31 'does not look promising as a solution, based on what they have
shown us'.
Senior debtholders are owed CDollars 1.2bn. If they quickly seized assets
after March 31, junior debt holders and preferred and common shareholders
would probably end up with nothing.
Trizec, hit by the property market collapse in North America, and with
insufficient cashflow to service debt, said its primary aim was to have a
recapitalisation plan accepted so the company could survive intact.
Abitibi-Price, the North American pulp and paper group, plans to raise
CDollars 173.5m of new equity next month with a public issue of common stock
at Dollars 17.35 a share.
The proceeds will be used for capital projects, debt refinancing and working
capital.

FT  24 MAR 94 / International Company News: NTT links with Microsoft in
software distribution venture
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
NTT, Japan's largest tele-communications carrier, and Microsoft, the world's
leading software house, are co-operating in a novel method for the low-cost
distribution of computer software.
Some observers believe the venture could result in the two companies
eventually working closely on other aspects of multimedia, the delivery of a
range of services to the office and the home through telecommunications
channels.
A spokesperson for Microsoft, however, insisted that the arrangement was not
an alliance and no agreements had been signed. The venture is limited only
to Japan.
The software distribution system is designed to exploit NTT's
telecommunications network and expertise in software encryption, together
with Microsoft's software skills.
The idea is that Microsoft programs will be distributed cheaply on CD-Rom
disks, which can be read by a suitably equipped personal computer. The
information will be in an encrypted or coded form.
Part of the program, however, will not be coded and can be inspected by a
prospective customer. If the customer is satisfied with the program, they
will be able to license the entire software package by downloading a
decryption key over the telephone network.
The plan is that NTT will profit from the use of its network, its encryption
system and its payment collection methods, while Microsoft will benefit by
distributing and licensing its software to a wider audience.
Eventually, the two companies hope to develop a system where customers will
be able to download software of their choice directly through the network,
rather like the 'video-on-demand' services now being tested.

<TEXT>
Volvo, Sweden's biggest manufacturer, yesterday appointed a new head for its
truck division.
Mr Sten Langenius, who built Volvo into one of the world's top truck makers,
is to step aside after 17 years and will be succeeded by Mr Karl-Erling
Trogen. It is the latest move in a review of senior management, begun since
it scrapped a plan to merge with France's Renault, which prompted the
resignation of its long-time chairman Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar.
Mr Trogen, head of Volvo's US truck operation, was to have been in charge of
truck operations in the ill-fated Renault-Volvo company.
Mr Langenius, soon to reach retirement, will remain a full-time executive at
Volvo as vice-president, with responsibility for the smaller marine engine
and aero engine divisions.
Another top Gyllenhammar executive, Mr Lennart Jeansson, was left without a
clear function by the collapse of the merger plan. He had given up his
position as head of the car division to Mr Per-Erik Mohlin in preparation to
become finance chief of Renault-Volvo.
Mr Soren Gyll, chief executive, said management functions within Volvo were
still under review.

<TEXT>
Wasserstein Perella, the US investment banking boutique, announced that Mr
Fred Seegal had joined the firm as co-president. He had been joint head of
domestic corporate finance at Salomon Brothers.
Mr Seegal's appointment - the latest in a series of defections by top Wall
Street investment bankers working in the booming mergers and acquisitions
business - is Wasserstein Perella's first significant hiring since
co-founder Mr Joseph Perella left the firm last July.
After the departure of Mr Perella - who has since moved to Morgan Stanley -
the firm lost another senior executive when its president, Mr Charles Ward,
went to First Boston. Mr Bruce Wasserstein, current chairman and founder of
the advisory boutique with Mr Perella and two other First Boston executives
in 1988, has been running the firm on his own since then.
Mr Seegal, who worked at Lehman Brothers before joining Salomon in 1990, is
a specialist in advising companies in the media, telecommunications and
entertainment industries.
However, it is likely he has been hired as much for his management skills as
for his experience in the advisory and financing business. He will share
management responsibility with Mr Wasserstein. Mr Gary Parr, head of the
financial institutions business, is the firm's other co-president.
Mr Seegal arrives at a crucial juncture for Wasserstein Perella, which has
seen its position in the highly-competitive M&amp;A business slip badly.

FT  24 MAR 94 / International Company News: March proves the cruellest month
for IPOs - US investors are more selective about which offerings they buy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
March has not been kind to the US market for initial public offerings of
stock (IPOs). First, Northwest Airlines shook Wall Street by slashing the
asking price on its planned Dollars 400m public share issue, blaming weak
investor demand for new stock. Then, a week later, the Federal Reserve
raises short-term interest rates, the second monetary tightening in two
months. For the booming IPO market, both events spell trouble.
Or do they? Northwest said it was lowering the price on its 20m-share IPO by
almost a third because of the poor state of the market for stocks and new
issues. A rise in interest rates is traditionally bad for companies trying
to sell new stock, because higher rates tend to depress shares prices and
make shares look less attractive, compared with other investments. However,
the IPO market may be strong enough to withstand both developments.
Take the Northwest deal. Although it was not the first issue of the year to
encounter problems, the sight of a large IPO in trouble unnerved Wall
Street.
One investment banker said it should have worried the institutions which buy
the bulk of IPOs. 'Northwest was a big deal with big visibility. When they
cut the price, it sent a loud message. If I were on the buy side, I would
have to look at that and say: 'Whoa, what's going on here?' '
Yet airline industry analysts were quick to argue that the company was
forced to perform emergency surgery on its IPO because of problems unique to
the domestic airline business, and investment bankers were as quick to point
out that the airline's failure to attract sufficient demand for its shares
at the original asking price was not necessarily a reflection of a broader
malaise in the IPO market.
They had a point. While volume has slipped from last year's record totals,
the IPO market remains active. According to Securities Data, the US
financial information group, Dollars 41.7bn worth of IPOs were completed in
the US last year, at an average of 59 deals worth Dollars 3.47bn every
month.
So far this year, the average number of deals per month is down only
slightly at 54, while the average dollar value of deals is running at a
still solid Dollars 2.6bn a month.
While IPO activity remains strong, conventional wisdom would suggest that
the latest increase in interest rates will slow the market.
Not necessarily, judging by how well the market held up after the first rate
increase on February 4. That monetary tightening rattled bond and stock
markets badly, and throughout February stock market conditions steadily
deteriorated to a point where the climate for IPOs appeared to be less
favourable than it had been for more than a year.
After the Fed's rate increase, however, IPO volume actually rose, climbing
from 33 deals worth Dollars 2.19bn in January, to 68 deals worth Dollars
2.93bn in February. IPO volume this month - 39 deals worth Dollars 2.72bn by
March 22 - is running at a similar pace.
Moreover, the most worrying aspect of the February rate increase was the
negative reaction it received in financial markets. But this latest
tightening sent bond prices higher, not lower, as investors applauded the
Fed's anti-inflation resolve.
Yet the skies above the IPO market are not entirely cloud-free. First, Wall
Street is worried that if interest rates are on a long-term upward path, the
flows of investor money into mutual funds will eventually reverse. Heavy
demand for stock from mutual funds loaded with cash has been one of the main
factors behind the long-running IPO boom, and without it, the IPO market
would clearly struggle.
Second, there have been signs recently that investors have become more
selective about which IPOs they buy, and any further increase in interest
rates would only make them more cautious.
Mr David Komansky, head of debt and equity markets at Merrill Lynch, says:
'For the past four or five weeks . . . we've seen the IPO market become even
more selective than before. There is still a very significant pipeline of
deals, but I think this break in the market has caused a degree of
uncertainty that will certainly make investors more quality conscious.'
A banker from another big underwriting house concurs: 'There is no question
that the syndication process has got a little more difficult.'
He believes the IPO market's immediate future depends on how quickly the
bond and stock markets get over the interest rate increases. 'Ultimately,
the longer it takes to shake off the effects of the Fed's actions, the more
skittish the buyer becomes and the more difficult it is to sell new
product.'
Ms Susan Hirsch, an analyst who tracks the performance of IPOs at Lehman
Brothers, says there is no immediate cause for concern, but agrees that if
long-term interest rates keep climbing, it could spell trouble. 'If you get
the long bond over 7 per cent, you start skirting with real problems.'
Ms Hersch explains that most valuation models used by the growth-oriented
investment institutions - traditionally big buyers of IPOs - are based on an
assumption that the yield on the long bond stays at or below 7 per cent.
The long bond yield has risen from 6.2 per cent to more than 6.8 per cent
since the Fed first raised rates, and if the yield climbs through 7 per
cent, growth-oriented investors will start to look at different
price-earnings models when judging whether to buy into IPOs. 'It would have
an effect on the IPO calendar for sure,' she says.
For now, however, the outlook remains reasonably bright. The fact that the
bond market took Tuesday's rate increases in its stride, and that the bond
yield dropped below 6.9 per cent, suggested the recent sell-off of
government securities may have run its course, at least for now.
Moreover, because uncertainty generated by a shaky bond market has made
investors wary of committing fresh funds to equities lately, there has been
a significant build-up of cash on the sidelines.
So, while investors are likely to be more selective about which IPOs they
buy, interest rates would have to rise much higher than current levels
before investors would start putting their cash into investments other than
equities, which still provide the best returns available at the moment.
As Mr Komansky of Merrill Lynch says: 'My own feeling is that there is a
supply of mega-deals out there, and if the markets can accommodate them,
dollar volume will be significantly higher than people expect. But the
number of deals will certainly be down because of selectivity.'

FT  24 MAR 94 / International Company News: Gerstner to unveil IBM recovery
plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Lou Gerstner, chairman and chief executive of International Business
Machines, is expected to unveil his strategies to return the ailing computer
company to profitable growth at a meeting with analysts in New York
tomorrow.
For the past eight months IBM has been conducting a 'thorough and detailed
review' of its operations and Mr Gerstner is expected to discuss the
preliminary results of that review.
Industry analysts are anticipating a frank discussion of IBM's problems and
Mr Gerstner's plans to solve them but its executives are attempting to
temper high expectations for his presentation.
'The only way he could exceed expectations is by ascending through the
ceiling at the end of his presentation,' joked Mr James Cannavino, IBM
senior vice-president for strategy and development.
However, Mr Mark Stahlman of New Media Associates, a New York industry
consulting group, said: 'He should unveil a broad set of initiatives in both
the businesses the company is currently addressing and some new business
areas.'
In particular, IBM watchers are anxious to hear how Mr Gerstner plans to
address the problems of its shrinking mainframe computer business. Last year
sales of IBM's mainframes declined by 27.6 per cent to Dollars 10bn.
Similarly, analysts anticipate some direction from Mr Gerstner on the
company's storage products division, which has seen its sales decline by 18
per cent over the past year to Dollars 5.1bn.
IBM also needs to find ways to make its Dollars 9.7bn personal computer
business more profitable and to boost earnings from its growing services
business, which also recorded revenues of Dollars 9.7bn last year, an
increase of 32 per cent.
The ailing computer company must also make decisions about investments in
new semiconductor production, the core technology of its hardware products,
and assigning research and development funds to new areas of potential
growth.
Mr Gerstner is also expected to announce new initiatives to address the
emerging market for broadband multimedia communications.
Yet the first public discussion of Mr Gerstner's strategic plans for IBM
since he joined the company almost 12 months ago, is certain to receive
broad attention from its customers as well as industry analysts.

FT  24 MAR 94 / International Company News: Canadian power group ahead 5.1%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GIBBENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hydro-Quebec, one of Canada's biggest electric power utilities, posted net
profit of CDollars 761m (USDollars 567.9m) for 1993, up 5.1 per cent from
1992.
Favourable natural conditions, tighter cost control and lower interest rates
helped the advance. The utility derives nearly all its power from
hydro-generating sites.
Total electricity sales were up 5.2 per cent, mainly due to higher
industrial demand and higher exports to the US while sales revenue rose 3.5
per cent to CDollars 7bn.
Operating expenses, fuel, depreciation, amortisation and taxes were CDollars
3.76bn, up 3.6 per cent, but operating expenses alone advanced 1.7 per cent.
Taxes plus debt guarantee fees totalled CDollars 650m, up from CDollars 594m
in 1992.
Total investment was CDollars 4bn, slightly lower than 1992. Most of the
money went to the new generating capacity in the James Bay area.
No dividend will be paid.

FT  24 MAR 94 / International Company News: BNP hit by sharp rise in
provisions on bad loans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Banque Nationale de Paris, the French banking group that last autumn staged
a highly successful privatisation, yesterday announced that net profits fell
by 53 per cent to FFr1.02bn (Dollars 172.9m) in 1993 from FFr2.17bn in 1992.
Mr Michel Pebereau, who last summer was appointed chairman of BNP to
spearhead its sale to the private sector, had warned the stock market of the
fall in profits.
Mr Pebereau said yesterday that the group had been affected 'by the
difficult economic environment across continental Europe, particularly in
France, our main market.'
In spite of the pressures on the French banking sector, which has for the
past two years been depressed by weak demand for credit, BNP managed to
increase its net banking income by 4.9 per cent to FFr41.46bn in 1993 from
FFr39.52bn in the previous year.
The group made progress in cutting costs and, like other French banks,
benefited from a strong performance in market trading, notably during the
summer currency crisis.
As a result, operating profits rose faster than revenue, increasing by 8.5
per cent to FFr12.46bn in 1993 from FFr11.48bn in 1992.
However, BNP was forced to make large provisions on its sour loans to
corporate clients and on the fall in value of some investments, principally
in the property sector.
It raised its total provisions by 43.8 per cent to FFr10.81bn in 1993 from
FFr7.52bn in 1992.
The scale of this increase was exaggerated by the absence of a FFr1.59bn
writeback on previous sovereign risk provisions in 1992.
BNP was forced in 1993 to make an additional writedown of FFr176m on
sovereign risks and raised provisions on its commercial banking business by
16.7 per cent to FFr10.63bn.

FT  24 MAR 94 / International Company News: KNP slides to Fl 343m net loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   AMSTERDAM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
KNP BT, the Dutch paper and packaging group, expects to see a strong return
to profit in 1994 after falling deeply into the red in 1993 as a result of
heavy restructuring costs and difficult trading conditions in Europe, the
company's main market.
Mr Robert van Oordt, chairman, said net profit would bounce back to at least
Fl 100m (Dollars 52.6m) in 1994 from a net loss of Fl 343m in 1993, when
results were influenced by extraordinary charges of Fl 320m. In 1992, KNP BT
posted a pro forma net profit of Fl 116m.
The company, created in March 1993 out of a merger between the Netherlands'
three leading paper and packaging companies, was confronted with declining
demand, overcapacity and lower sales prices in Europe last year at a time
when it was trying to integrate its operations.
The merger took place against the backdrop of the 'deepest and most
prolonged' decline in paper prices in 20 years, Mr van Oordt said.
The dividend is cut by Fl 0.10 to Fl 0.45. The company attributed the
limited decline in the pay-out to its expectations of a strong improvement
ahead.
At the operating level, profit fell sharply to Fl 294m last year from Fl
538m in 1992.
Of the group's four main businesses, only the paper merchandising and office
products sector managed to hold operating results at 1992 levels. The paper
sector and the graphic and information systems sector reversed into
operating losses, while operating profits in packaging fell to Fl 295m from
Fl 366m.
Mr van Oordt said he was encouraged by increases in paper prices in late
1993.

FT  24 MAR 94 / International Company News: Bank Austria wins GiroCredit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK BLUM and IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   VIENNA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Bank Austria, the country's largest bank, has won the battle for control of
GiroCredit, the country's third largest bank, banking sources in Vienna said
last night.
The takeover, which was due to be announced next week, will help reduce
competition in Austria's financial sector and lift Bank Austria's relatively
weak presence in the domestic capital markets.
The outcome followed the threat on Monday by GiroCredit's four executive
directors to resign when their contracts expire at the end of June.
The executives said that they had acted out of frustration with the
stalemate over strategy on the bank's supervisory board.
GiroCredit is owned by Austria's savings banks, which use it as a central
clearing organisation.
The two largest savings banks groups, Bank Austria and First Austrian, with
30 per cent and 20 per cent stakes respectively, have resented GiroCredit's
competition against them.
To break the stalemate, First Austrian proposed last spring the formation of
a consortium of savings banks to buy out Bank Austria. But it faced
considerable difficulty convincing the savings banks of the merit of its
proposal.
On March 1, Bank Austria, frustrated with the delay, launched a bid for 20.4
per cent of GiroCredit at Sch370 per share.
Last weekend, at a meeting of five large provincial savings banks, it became
clear that only one would reject the Bank Austria proposal.
Bank Austria has since sweetened its offer, and is offering Sch400 per share
for all GiroCredit shares tendered. It is offering to sell some of its own
branches to savings banks to help them in their local markets.

The Swedish government said yesterday its sale to the public of a 34 per
cent stake in AssiDoman, the forestry group, had been more than two times
subscribed.
Combined with a further 15 per cent placed with Swedish and foreign
institutions, the sale will raise SKr7.6bn (Dollars 962m).
Mr Per Westerberg, the industry minister, said he intended to go ahead with
the even larger privatisation in June of Pharmacia, the state-controlled
pharmaceutical group spun off last year from Procordia.
That issue could raise as much as SKr16bn at current market prices, but some
doubts have been raised about the timing due to a spate of new issues in the
Swedish market this year and the apparent end of a recent bull market.
Mr Westerberg said market conditions would dictate how much of the state's
45 per cent stake would be sold off this year but the intention was to
dispose of the entire holding.
Some 590,000 Swedes applied for 86m shares in AssiDoman, 2.3 times the 37.5m
on offer. The shares, to be listed from April 8, were priced at SKr138 for
the public, a discount from the price of SKr153 set for institutions which
valued the group at more than SKr16bn.

FT  24 MAR 94 / International Company News: Topdanmark returns to profit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Topdanmark, the Danish insurance group, returned to profit of DKr107m
(Dollars 16m) in 1993 after losing DKr53m in 1992 and DKr273m in 1991. A
dividend of DKr10 was proposed for 1993. No dividend was paid for 1992.
The return to profit was due primarily to gains on securities in the buoyant
Danish bond and share market last year. Capital gains soared to DKr348m,
from DKr58m in 1992.
There was an operating loss of DKr274m following on losses of DKr111m in
1992 and DKr347m in 1991.
The insurance divisions made a profit on insurance operations of DKr107m
compared with a 1992 loss of DKr50m. But after capital income profit
increased to DKr372m from DKr192m in 1992.
Total premium income was unchanged at DKr3.2bn. Administration costs were
cut to DKr715m from DKr808m.
Group equity capital at the end of last year was DKr2.53bn, up by DKr100m
from 1992. Total assets increased to DKr30.07bn fro DKr28.72bn.
The Lauritzen shipping and shipbuilding group moved into deficit of DKr171m
(Dollars 25.5m) last year after making a net profit of DKr83m in 1992.
The group blamed weak markets for gas tankers, drilling rigs, bulk tankers
and refrigerated cargo vessels for the poor performance. It added that the
European Union's imposition of quotas on bananas imported from South America
and tariffs on fruit from Argentina and Chile had an adverse effect on the
result of its refrigerated cargo operations.
Group sales slipped to DKr13.48bn from DKr13.96bn. There was a loss of
DKr153m after net financial items compared with a 1992 profit of DKr146m.
There was an extraordinary DKr110m write-down of the value of drilling rigs
and only DKr8m income from the sale of ships.
The parent company, Lauritzen Holding, will pay no dividend for 1993, the
group said.

FT  24 MAR 94 / International Company News: Strong turnround at Nordbanken
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Nordbanken, which the Swedish government rescued from collapse with a
SKr51bn (Dollars 6.5bn) bail-out operation, yesterday announced a 1993
operating profit of SKr2.7bn, making it the country's most profitable bank
last year.
The profit followed a record loss of SKr16.6bn in 1992 when Nordbanken
became the biggest victim of a loan-loss crisis which swept through the
Swedish banking system in 1992.
The spectacular return to the black outstripped the profit of SKr1.8bn
achieved last year by Svenska Handelsbanken, the bank which avoided the
worst of the credit loss slump. It is bound to reinforce complaints by
Handelsbanken, Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken and other banks that the scale
of state assistance to Nordbanken gave it an unfair competitive advantage.
Nordbanken's 1993 results show the effects of the state's bail-out. The
off-loading of SKr67bn-worth of bad loans to Securum, a separately-run 'bad
bank', meant credit losses - mostly accrued in the property sector - tumbled
to SKr4.2bn from SKr19.2bn in 1992.
Non-performing loans stood at SKr12.2bn, compared with SKr39.4bn in 1992.
Provisions for problem loans were set at SKr6.3bn compared with SKr22.4bn.
Nordbanken received capital injections from the state worth SKr16bn, while
the authorities used a further SKr35bn of taxpayers' money to capitalise
Securum. In addition, Nordbanken took over Gota Bank, another victim of the
crisis bailed out at state expense, at the turn of the year.
It did not consolidate Gota in its 1993 accounts. But the authorities have
responded to the criticism by the other banks by pointing out that
Nordbanken is having to spend SKr3bn in further recapitalisation at Gota.
Gota earlier this week announced an operating loss in 1993 of SKr13.6bn in
spite of the injection of SKr20bn in state funds and a bad loan laundering
operation similar to the Securum operation at Nordbanken.
At the underlying level, Nordbanken said that profits before credit losses
rose sharply thanks to falling interest rates and higher investment income.
Excluding the effects of the Securum operation, Nordbanken said profits
before credit losses were up 31 per cent to SKr6.9bn.

FT  24 MAR 94 / International Company News: Credit Lyonnais rescue package
expected today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Edmond Alphandery, the French economy minister, will today finalise a
rescue package to recapitalise Credit Lyonnais, the troubled banking group.
The package, details of which will be announced this evening together with
Credit Lyonnais's 1993 results, is understood to include a capital injection
of at least FFr4bn (Dollars 678m). It will transfer most of Credit
Lyonnais's non-performing property loans into a new state-controlled company
with the government guaranteeing about FFr15bn of those loans.
The ministry yesterday stressed that the exact size of the capital increase
would not be decided until Mr Alphandery had seen the 1993 accounts. He will
then decide what proportion of the transfered loans will be guaranteed by
the state.
Credit Lyonnais's accounts will be presented to a board meeting today. The
accounts will then be shown to Mr Alphandery so that he can finalise the
rescue package. Officials declined to comment on French press reports that
the Caisse des Depots, the state financial institution, would participate in
the capital injection together with Thomson, the electronics group that owns
21.6 per cent of Credit Lyonnais.
Analysts are braced for a ghastly set of 1993 figures with a net loss of up
to FFr5bn for 1993 against FFr1.85bn in 1992, after Mr Jean Peyrelevade, who
became chairman last November, has made hefty provisions on the bank's bad
loans and failed investments.
'The sky's the limit,' said Ms Sheila Garrard, banking analyst at Lehman
Brothers. 'All we can do is guess that the new chairman will clear
everything out. It's anyone's guess what the final loss will be.'

FT  24 MAR 94 / International Company News: Bayerische Vereinsbank rises 32%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Bayerische Vereinsbank yesterday became the second large German bank to
report substantial growth in profits for 1993. The Munich-based Vereinsbank
said group operating profits after provisions for bad and doubtful debts
increased by 32 per cent to DM1.16bn (Dollars 687m).
The increase, more details of which will be revealed today, follows a 33 per
cent increase in profits from Bayerische Hypotheken und Wechsel Bank, the
other big Bavarian bank which reported earlier this week. It means that
Vereinsbank's profits growth accelerated in the last two months of 1993
following a 27 per cent rise in the first 10 months of the year.
Bayerische Vereinsbank, which has just below a quarter of the domestic
mortgage market, said the dividend would increase by DM3 to DM16. Half the
increase is designed to pass on to shareholders the benefits of reduced
corporate taxation; the other half is a special dividend to celebrate the
bank's 125th anniversary reached in May this year.
Hypo-Bank earlier this week reported that provisioning for bad and doubtful
debts climbed by 31.1 per cent to DM1.16bn and warned that the bad debt
situation is unlikely to improve until 1995.
The rise in provisions was offset by an increase in profits from own account
trading as well as from lending business and fee income, a pattern likely to
be repeated today.
Both the big Bavarian banks have a high exposure to mortgage lending
business, which was buoyant last year amid excellent conditions in most
sectors of the German banking market.

FT  24 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Richardsons up 31% and calls for Pounds
5.7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Richardsons Westgarth, the steel stockholder and processor, yesterday
reported a 31 per cent increase in annual profits and announced plans to
raise Pounds 5.7m via a fully underwritten rights issue.
For 1993 the group's continuing operations lifted turnover from Pounds 53.5m
to Pounds 67m, and this generated profits of Pounds 2.52m (Pounds 1.92m) at
the pre-taxlevel.
Earnings edged ahead to 4.9p (4.6p) and a proposed final dividend of 1.9p
raises the total from 3p to 3.2p.
The cash call is of 7.2m new ordinary shares on a 1-for-4 basis at 85p a
share. Yesterday, the shares closed 4p lower at 101p.
The proceeds of the issue will be used to finance a planned capital
expenditure programme.
And it will fund increased working capital requirements expected to arise
from sales growth in 1994 and 1995.
The directors feel the rights issue will allow the group flexibility to
continue to expand primarily through investment in new processing capacity
and facilities while maintaining a sound financial position.
The issue is underwritten by Baring Brothers with Cazenove acting as broker.
On prospects, Mr Roger Payton, chairman, said trading across the group for
the opening two months of 1994 had been satisfactory.
He cautioned, however, that although he looked to a general, though
restrained, increase in demand, that must be set against overcapacity in
steel production in Europe and the fragility of the UK economy.

FT  24 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Reorganised Wace at Pounds 15.9m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wace, the pre-press and specialist printing group, yesterday confirmed that
new management had put the business back on an even keel following the
sudden departure of its chief executive in 1992.
Pre-tax profits were Pounds 15.9m in the year to December 31, compared with
losses of Pounds 28.4m caused by substantial property write-downs and
restructuring provisions. Turnover grew from Pounds 321m to Pounds 336m.
Mr Frans ten Bos, chairman, said: 'While economic prospects remain
uncertain, there has been an encouraging start to the year but there is no
clear evidence of increased activity in our major markets. However, there
are good opportunities to reduce further our cost base and rationalise our
businesses.'
Wace spent Pounds 3.1m on reorganisation and redundancy and cut the
workforce from 5,038 to 4,621, with most jobs being shed in the US.
Mr Trevor Grice, chief executive, said Wace had a lot of little business
which he had been 'clustering' into larger units.
This focusing would continue, although at a less rapid rate.
Mr Grice said tighter financial and operational disciplines helped to
generate Pounds 23.3m of cash. This, together with the proceeds of a Pounds
6.2m share placement, reduced group borrowings by Pounds 29.5m to Pounds
59.2m.
Gearing is still high, at 100 per cent, but Mr Grice said the group had
agreed with its bankers that it would be better for shareholders if gearing
was reduced by cashflow, rather than a rights issue.
The group said that uncertainty resulting from the planned sale of Wace USA
at the beginning of the year was largely responsible for its trading profits
falling from Pounds 9.02m to Pounds 8.44m. However, once it was announced
that the business would remain within Wace, performance had recovered -
particularly in the second half.
Earnings per share were 11.6p, compared with losses of 44p.
A proposed final dividend of 2.5p gives a total of 3.5p (2.25p), a rise of
56 per cent.
COMMENT
These figures were well received and the shares rose by 4p to 247p - a long
way from the 48p they touched at the end of 1992 following the sudden exit
of Mr John Clegg. With his successor, Mr Grice, firmly in the saddle,
analysts can focus on more traditional questions - when will the advertising
cycle turn, and is there a long-term threat to pre-press, as agencies and
other customers do more work in-house? Wace is highly geared operationally
for any upturn in demand, but that still looks elusive. On forecast profits
of Pounds 22m this year, the shares are on a prospective multiple of 17.
They have had a good run, but could still have further upside if and when
advertising volume improves.

FT  24 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Quality Software meets market hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Quality Software Products, the Gateshead-based developer of large scale
accounting software, met market expectations at the end of its first year
after joining the main market.
The group made profits before tax of Pounds 553,000 in the year to the end
of December, a 54 per cent decline on the Pounds 1.2m recorded the year
before. The company said the profit figure was struck after Pounds 1.3m had
been invested in positioning the business for a much larger market.
Turnover rose slightly to Pounds 13.3m (Pounds 13.1m). Earnings totalled
7.3p (20.6p) and a dividend of 1.25p is recommended.
QSP specialises in accounting software for large companies. The 1993 year
was a period of extreme disruption not only because of flotation but also
because it completed an advanced, open systems, version of its flagship Olas
product. Universal OLAS has now been sold to eight customers and is live at
one, Express Gifts.
Mr Alan Mordain, chairman, said the remaining systems would be fully
operational by June.
The company's prospects have been greatly improved by deals struck earlier
in the year with IATA, the airlines organisation, Continuum, a supplier of
insurance software and with Global Software, a US accounting software
company with some 800 customers.
It is thought likely that many of Global's customers will wish to adopt the
advanced client-server design of Universal Olas. Mr Mordain said that the
six principal modules in Universal Olas had now been completed and were
ready for installation.

FT  24 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Lower whisky prices hit Burn Stewart
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Profits at Burn Stewart Distillers, the Scotch whisky producer, collapsed in
the six months to end-December as a result of falling whisky prices. Pre-tax
profits were down 58 per cent at Pounds 1.81m on sales 3.6 per cent lower at
Pounds 19.5m.
Mr Bill Thornton, chairman, said prices for its case sales of whisky were
down 12 per cent, though volume had risen by 44 per cent. The price pressure
had come chiefly from the multiple retailers.
'Pricing is the key factor for the future. Our view is that any move from
here can only be up, but there's no evidence that will happen in the short
term. We're optimistic about some progress in 1995.'
In 1993, the company said, case sales had made up 84 per cent of its total
volume and bulk sales the remainder. Of the 84 per cent, 50 percentage
points went to own label and the remaining 34 to Burn Stewart brands.
Bulk whisky sales were down 10 per cent by volume, Mr Thornton said. Because
most of these sales were of high-margin mature malt, this had a
disproportionate effect on profits.
The pre-tax figure was after a gain this time on disposal of shares of
Pounds 298,000.
Earnings per share were 2.08p (4.95p) and the dividend was held at 1.7p.

FT  24 MAR 94 / UK Company News: A time to look ahead and assess the
benefits of recession - Now that signs of an industrial recovery in the UK
are showing through, Andrew Baxter takes a last look at the FT Six
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Relief that the UK recession is more or less over and that activity is
picking up at a modest pace has been the message accompanying improved
results from manufacturers over the past few weeks.
That relief is shared by the six engineering companies the FT has been
tracking out of the recession since 1992. But this last report in an
occasional series demonstrates that the upturn in the UK is not the only
thing for which they are thankful.
The broad conclusion to emerge from this series is that the six companies
have come through the recession in reasonably good shape, albeit somewhat
slimmer. An article in tomorrow's FT Ingenuity survey, for example, shows
that product development programmes have been maintained and even,
occasionally, extended throughout the past three years.
Top executives from the six companies met recently for the first time to
review progress and reflect on the broader issues relating to manufacturing
in the UK.
As they look back on three tough years of trading, punctuated by inevitable
job cuts in their UK manufacturing operations, several are counting the
benefits of having international sales that far exceed their UK business.
In 1991 and 1992, it was business in continental Europe that helped offset
the gloom at home. But as Germany plunged into recession, dragging the rest
of con-tinental Europe with it, many of the FT Six have been looking to the
US market to lift their fortunes. More recently, the UK has been picking up
too.
Bloxwich Engineering
At Bloxwich Engineering, which makes vehicle parts and other products, sales
to the car industry have picked up, says Mr Peter Burton, chief executive.
Overall, he thinks the company's UK business is 'coming on gently,' and
points out that its forging business, which covers a broad spectrum of
markets, has seen slightly increased demand.
Senior Engineering
Mr John Bell, chief executive at Senior Engineering, the specialist tubing,
ductwork and boilers group, agrees that 'coming on gently' is exactly the
right expression to use for conditions in the UK market, with sales to some
industries going very well and others not seeing any improve-ment yet.
Posiva
At Posiva, the Scunthorpe-based importer of gears and drives, business has
picked up since about the middle of last year, especially in the textile
machine industry, although Mr Reg Bricknell, managing director, notes that
the uplift is coming mainly from customers whose equipment is destined for
overseas markets.
The same applies for gearboxes going into mechanical handling equipment, he
says.
600 Group
At 600 Group, which manufactures and distributes machine tools and materials
handling equipment, there has been some improvement in the UK machine tool
market, which always comes late in the cycle, says Mr Colin Gaskell,
managing director.
'But I don't like to say recovery is on the way in case the government does
something stupid like putting 5 per cent on interest rates,' he says.
JC Bamford
Mr Martin Coyne, chief executive of JC Bamford, the biggest UK construction
equipment producer, says UK business picked up about 20 per cent last year,
reflecting the way the plant hirers attenuate trends - they had destocked to
such an extent that even a slight increase in business leads to a big demand
for new equipment.
But in terms of conditions in the construction industry, which JCB serves,
with only a slight increase in housebuilding activity Mr Coyne is still
fairly pessimistic about the recession being over.
Fenner
Mr Mark Abrahams, finance director at Fenner, which makes fluid power
equipment, industrial conveyor belting and transmission products, makes a
slightly different point about the UK recession.
'We've seen quite a significant number of our UK customers disappear. The
previous recession took a large slice out and now another slice has gone.
It's a slightly worrying trend,' he says.
It is no wonder, therefore, that companies are relieved not to be too
dependent on the UK. 'British groups which have any businesses in North
America are saying 'thank goodness', as you will see when our numbers come
out (next week).' says Mr Bell. That is not simply because of current market
conditions, he says: the UK's economy still has a see-saw nature, 'and that
would worry me about having too big a UK sales base.'
Mr Gaskell and Mr Coyne, too, are glad that they only have 25 per cent of
their businesses in the UK. JCB is doing extremely well in the US and at 600
Group overseas markets, apart from Europe, are showing quite a strong
recovery.
On the other hand, there is general agreement that the UK is an attractive
base for manufacturing, if not always for selling. 'There's no better place
to manufacture than the UK,' says Mr Coyne. 'It's half the cost of Germany.'
Mr Bricknell, meanwhile, says he is trying to persuade his German parent
company to start manufacturing in the UK.
Still, not all the FT Six would make the UK their first choice for any
future investment in new factories. Mr Gaskell believes that, although pay
rates are higher in the US, 'you can run a leaner operation there'.
Mr Abrahams argues that UK manufacturing may have learnt some good lessons
through the past two recessions, after it had had it too good for too long,
but the cycles have destroyed much of manufacturing.
Varying solutions, therefore, are proposed for how the government and the
City could help build up the UK's manufacturing base. Old-fashioned
intervention is generally ruled out, although Mr Burton believes a
government industrial strategy is needed to prevent recurrence of a
'disgrace' such as the collapse of Leyland-DAF.
Others, like Mr Gaskell, believe the UK economy would be in better shape if
government spending and bureaucratic waste was cut, and both he and Mr
Bricknell believe industry should have a much stronger role in controlling
how government money on research and development is spent.
Mr Coyne says the UK needs to emulate the ability of the Japanese to get
finance for new investment into the grass roots of British industry, thus
creating an environment where small companies can grow.

FT  24 MAR 94 / UK Company News: N Sea Assets boosts profit to Pounds 1.95m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
North Sea Assets, the energy industry services supplier, reported pre-tax
profits up from Pounds 1.33m, after losses on asset sales of Pounds 478,000,
to Pounds 1.95m.
The result was also helped by lower net interest charges of Pounds 468,000,
against Pounds 656,000.
Turnover was Pounds 29.3m, against Pounds 23m, which included Pounds 1.44m
from discontinued activities.
Continuing activities showed a 36 per cent improvement but this was not
translated into a similar increase in profits because of cost over-runs on
certain projects.
Acquisitions and capital investment totalled Pounds 5.8m, but year-end debt
only rose from Pounds 2.3m to Pounds 5m for gearing of 53 per cent (25 per
cent).
Earnings were 2.76p (2.08p). The dividend is 1.1p (1p).

FT  24 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Frederick Cooper up 37% and confident on
future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Frederick Cooper, the West Midlands architectural hardware, coatings and
electrical group, yesterday reported what it called its 'best interim
trading performance' since 1989 as it exploited slightly improved markets
off a reduced cost base.
Pre-tax profits for the half year to January 31 were 37 per cent higher from
Pounds 1.77m to Pounds 2.43m. Earnings per share rose to 3.3p from 2.5p.
Mr Eddie Kirk, chairman, said he was confident enough about prospects to
recommend an increase in the interim dividend from 0.7p to 0.8p. Total
payments for the year to last July were 2.2p.
'Our costs are firmly under control and we continue to gain market share in
all divisions. Our outstanding order book is 10 per cent higher than last
year and additional new products provide further potential to increase
turnover in the second half,' Mr Kirk said.
He added that a new range of high security multi-locks had just won orders
which would raise turnover by Pounds 500,000 a year starting in June.
During the first half turnover rose from Pounds 40.1m to Pounds 44.3m, of
which Pounds 528,000 came from a metal railings business, which has now been
closed.
The most striking increase in the results came from the manufacturing side
of the security and architectural hardware division, where profits more than
doubled to over Pounds 1m. Spectra, the US coatings business acquired last
May, made a first contribution to profits of Pounds 170,000.
Although Mr Kirk thinks the prospects for Frederick Cooper are the best for
five years, he finds the UK economic recovery 'fragile'. The coatings trade
in Germany remains steady but the French and Italian markets are still
sluggish.

FT  24 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Acquisition helps TT improve 44% to Pounds
24m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Profits from TT Group were helped by the turnround at AB Electronics,
acquired at the start of the year, and full year contributions from
businesses bought in 1992, and showed a 43.8 per cent rise at the pre-tax
level to Pounds 23.9m.
The figure for the year to December 25 was struck after a Pounds 397,000
goodwill write-off relating to the sale of the natural twine business.
Mr Timothy Reed, chairman, said 1994 had started ahead of expectations. The
UK and US economies were now coming out of recession.
Group turnover more than doubled to Pounds 357.8m, with Pounds 156.7m coming
from AB. Operating profits rose 42.4 per cent to Pounds 27.7m, of which AB
made Pounds 5.49m. AB was losing about Pounds 1m a month when bought, for
Pounds 13.6m plus the assumption of Pounds 25m of debt, but was into profit
by April.
Operating margins for the group were down at 7.7 per cent (11.4 per cent) as
AB made a much lower margin of 3.5 per cent. The group aims for a 10 per
cent return on sales from operations.
The electronics and industrial division, into which AB falls, increased
profits to Pounds 18.6m (Pounds 10.3m). Packaging profits were barely ahead
at Pounds 8.2m (Pounds 8.1m) after significant costs in moving three
factories to one site. The building services division suffered a downturn in
profits from Pounds 1.1m to Pounds 800,000, feeling the recession in the
construction industry as its products are used late in the building cycle.
Interest charges rose Pounds 551,000 to Pounds 3.35m as a result of the AB
borrowings, in spite of the Pounds 51.4m proceeds of last summer's rights
issue which were received in September. At the year end the group was cash
positive.
Mr Nicholas Shipp, joint chief executive, said TT had the resources to make
a Pounds 50m acquisition but that prices of UK companies had risen sharply
over the last year and were out of the group's range now.
A deal in the US was more likely, although not until later this year or
early next.
A lower tax rate, of 23.9 per cent (26.2 per cent), helped offset some of
the dilutive effect of the rights issue, and earnings per share were 19.3p
(16.2p), or 19.8p excluding the goodwill write-off.
A final dividend of 4p is proposed to give a total of 6.6p (6p).
COMMENT
TT is at last gaining the rating it deserves. Those who took up last year's
rights at 240p will be pleased with a share price up 12p to 384p yesterday .
The management's skills at turning round lossmakers have been proved once
again with the performance at AB. The only question might be whether there
are enough reasonably priced targets these days for TT to buy. But with many
companies divesting businesses and TT looking in the US and Europe, as well
as the UK, it should find some gems among the hundreds it looks at every
year. On forecasts around Pounds 30m pre-tax and a continuing low tax rate,
the prospective p/e is around 17 1/2 which leaves something more to go for.

FT  24 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Town Centre improves to Pounds 3.95m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Town Centre Securities, the Leeds-based property investment and development
company, yesterday revealed pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.95m for the six
months ended December 31 1993, compared with Pounds 3.65m.
The interim dividend has been increased by 9 per cent to 1.2p, up from 1.1p.
During the year the company bought the freeholds of two of its leasehold
properties with the result that at the year end only Pounds 11m of its
Pounds 193m property portfolio was long leasehold, compared with Pounds 64m
previously.
There will be a marginal impact on short-term earnings, as a result of the
cost of the acquisitions, but the strategy will strengthen the company's
balance sheet.
During the interim period, gross rental income increased by 10.5 per cent
from Pounds 8.91m to Pounds 9.84m, while interest charges increased
marginally to Pounds 3.1m.
Mr Arnold Ziff, chairman, said that the company should 'show further steady
improvement in the next six months'.
Earnings per share amounted to 2.68p, up from 2.4p.

FT  24 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Michael Page bolstered by second half
recovery
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Michael Page Group, recruitment and executive selection consultancy, staged
a sharp recovery in the second half of 1993 pushing pre-tax profits up from
a restated Pounds 1.86m to Pounds 3.84m.
The shares gained 1p to 77p yesterday.
Mr Terry Benson, who has been appointed chief executive, said the profits
reflect the recovery in the UK and Australia. In the UK the employment
market was at its most active for three years. Permanent recruitment,
adversely affected by the recession, showed a good increase in revenue, said
Mr Benson.
However, recession created difficult market conditions for all operations in
continental Europe. France and the Netherlands maintained profits but there
was a small loss in Germany.
The dividend is raised from 1.8p to 2.1p, with a final of 1.5p.
Turnover rose from Pounds 43.64m to Pounds 51.2m and earnings per share were
4.01p (2.04p).

FT  24 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Weir at Pounds 38m after exceptional -
Redundancy costs halt 10-year run of increasing profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An unbroken 10-year run of rising pre-tax profits came to an end last year
at Weir Group, but the Glasgow-based pumps and engineering products company
is still lifting its dividend by 10 per cent from 5.9p to 6.5p.
On turnover up from Pounds 425m to Pounds 449m Weir announced pre-tax
profits for the year to December 31 down from Pounds 39.2m to Pounds 37.5m.
The latest figures reflect a Pounds 2.4m exceptional item for redundancy
costs and a fall in interest and other income from Pounds 4.1m to Pounds
2.55m.
Earnings per share slipped from 17.7p to 17.3p, a little better than
expected and partly because of the benefit of US tax rule changes. The final
dividend is raised from 4.15p to 4.575p.
Mr Ron Garrick, chief executive, said he was 'a wee bit disappointed' by the
level of profit last year, but the company had managed a creditable
performance in continuing difficult trading conditions.
He pointed, in particular, to intense pricing competition in large projects
from state-owned Italian companies and Japanese competitors. Weir lost out
on a big Abu Dhabi project when an Italian competitor dropped its price by
30 per cent to 'create employment in Italy,' said Mr Garrick.
Excluding the exceptional item, Weir's profit margin slipped from 9.2 to 8.9
per cent, with a rise from 7.7 to 8.6 per cent in engineering services
offset by a decline from 7.5 to 7.1 per cent in the much larger engineering
products business.
New orders rose strongly, from Pounds 373m to Pounds 470m, helped by an
Pounds 80m Qatar desalination plant order in December. Orders from the
Indo-Pacific region nearly trebled to about Pounds 60m, and accounted for
13.5 per cent (6 per cent) of the total.
The UK share of orders, in contrast, fell from 45.4 to 34.8 per cent mainly
because of a dearth of business in the water industry.
On the outlook for this year, Viscount Weir, the chairman, said there was
'no reason why we should not continue to give a good account of ourselves,
and again produce satisfactory results.'
Mr Garrick said Weir was continuing to look for acquisitions following last
year's Pounds 16m purchase of most of Darchem, which makes insulation
systems and fabricated components.
COMMENT
It had to happen sometime, but the drop in profits should merely interrupt
the trend line rather than imply that Weir has gone ex-growth. No further
exceptional items are expected this year, and if the company found no
overall, strong and consistent revival in the market for capital goods last
year, business did pick up in the second half and so far this year. Margins
have slipped, but the company's competitive position remains strong,
especially against European rivals. The strong showing in the Pacific Rim is
encouraging and sustainable, and Weir's refusal to make continental European
acquisitions just for the sake of it now seems fortuitous - in the short
term at least, the US looks a better bet for takeovers. A modest rise in
pre-tax profits, to Pounds 42m-Pounds 43m this year, would put the company
on a prospective p/e of about 17.

<TEXT>
The way has been cleared for the public flotation of the Irish Permanent
Building Society on the London and Dublin stock exchanges this summer,
following approval of the conversion and flotation plans by the mutual
society's members.
The IPBS is Ireland's largest building society, having a 30 per cent share
of the residential mortgage market and assets of IPounds 2.7bn (Pounds
2.6bn). It is the first to convert to a plc.
Conversion will involve the issue of 84m free shares to about 227,000
members and a cash distribution of IPounds 200 per person for a further
100,000.
On completion of the flotation, which aims to raise up to IPounds 50m in new
capital through the issue of 34m shares, the company is expected to have a
market capitalisation of IPounds 180m-IPounds 200m, giving an indicative
share price of 150p-166p.

Arthur Wood &amp; Son (Longport), maker of earthenware, beakers and terracotta
teapots, reported pre-tax profits up from Pounds 76,882 to Pounds 119,134
for the year to end-December.
The improvement was achieved on turnover up by 6.9 per cent to Pounds 3.58m
(Pounds 3.34m) and was struck after a fall in net interest receivable to
Pounds 11,964 (Pounds 25,387) and abortive takeover costs of Pounds 69,100.
Mr Anthony Wood, chairman, said the main feature of the past six months had
been the very strong growth in export sales, which had increased by 48.6 per
cent from Pounds 498,511 to Pounds 740,895, representing 20.7 per cent (14.9
per cent) of total sales.
Disappointingly, the home market had remained flat, he said.
Earnings per share emerged at 4.9p (2.79p) and the single dividend for the
year is doubled to 3p.

FT  24 MAR 94 / UK Company News: More O'Ferrall hits Pounds 8m as UK market
improves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More O'Ferrall, the hoardings and bus shelter advertising company, boosted
pre-tax profits for 1993 from Pounds 220,000 to Pounds 7.8m on the back of
an improved UK market.
Mr Brian Turnbull, finance director, said gains in the UK and Ireland
reflected careful control of costs and the group's high level of operational
gearing.
Operating profits from continuing operations were 16 per cent ahead, from
Pounds 7.26m to Pounds 8.4m, on turnover of Pounds 67.6m. Last year's total
turnover of Pounds 63.4m contained Pounds 1.83m from the discontinued US
operation, which was sold in 1992.
Provision of Pounds 4.44m was made for the disposal, but in the event the
loss was Pounds 3.69m, allowing Pounds 750,000 to be released to 1993
profits.
Operating profits in the UK and Ireland rose from Pounds 4.2m to Pounds 5.9m
on turnover ahead from Pounds 38.5m to Pounds 43.6m.
Mr Russell Gore-Andrews, chairman, said the last quarter of the year had not
been as buoyant as expected, suggesting that key drinks advertisers had
spent Pounds 9m less than expected in the run-up to Christmas.
Following sterling's devaluation at the end of 1992, operating profits in
sterling were static in France and ahead in Belgium, which each accounted
for 17 per cent of total tunover. However, they were sharply lower in local
currencies.
Mr Turnbull described the Belgian result as reasonable in spite of the
recession. The group had acted early to cut costs in France as the recession
worsened, and further cost cutting measures were in progress.
In Taiwan, which represents 2 per cent of the group's business, both
turnover and operating profits were well ahead. Mr Gore-Andrews said the
group was planning to continue to grow the business, and would be exploring
the possible opportunities on mainland China.
Net interest payable fell from Pounds 1.96m to Pounds 1.39m, capital
expenditure was down from Pounds 7.5m to Pounds 4.8m, and gearing fell from
25 per cent to 20 per cent at year-end.
Earnings per share were 16.5p, compared with a loss of 4p last time. An
unchanged final dividend of 10p is proposed, giving an same-again 13.2p
total.
COMMENT
These results were in line with forecasts in spite of worse-than-expected
figures from France and the poor fourth quarter in the UK. The group also
did well to retrieve some of the anticipated cost of getting out of the
lossmaking operations in the US. Operating margins are around 12 per cent -
well below the group's potential. The group is well placed both to take
advantage of any European recovery and to spread its wings from Taiwan to
China. Pre-tax profits of around Pounds 10m for this year put it on a
prospective multiple of 20 - a little high, but still worth a look.

FT  24 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Exports boost Whatman to Pounds 10.7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Whatman, the manufacturer of filtration and purification products, yesterday
reported 10 per cent growth in 1993 pre-tax profits, boosted by sales to
Europe and Asia Pacific.
Profits were Pounds 10.7m, against Pounds 9.71m, restated for FRS 3.
Earnings per share were 30.76p, against 27.79p and the directors are
recommending a final dividend of 6.9p, making 10.2p (9.5p) for the year.
Whatman said the improving economic environment had been off-set by tougher
competition, but steady growth was forecast.
Turnover increased 15 per cent to Pounds 72m (Pounds 62.6m). Excluding the
impact of acquisitions and exchange rate changes, however, the underlying
growth was a more modest 5 per cent. Profit margins, excluding currency
movements, were stable, during the year.
Sales in 1993 were below initial forecasts, due to weaker demand from the US
pharmaceuticals industry, and a reduction of inventory by UK distributors.
There were stronger performances from new areas such as laboratory gas
generators, and bioprocessing media.
Sales outside the UK and US increased from 25 per cent to 30 per cent of
group turnover, and accounted for Pounds 21.9m of sales in 1993.
The US, however, accounted for about 57 per cent of sales. Whatman estimates
that a 10 per cent movement from a dollar/sterling exchange rate of 1.6, has
an estimated Pounds 1.5m impact on translated pre-tax profits.
Last year, Whatman acquired a 60 per cent stake in Biometra, a German
company specialising in molecular biology, for Pounds 3.5m, and the company
contributed Pounds 234,000 to profits.
Whatman also increased expenditure on research and development to 4.5 per
cent (4.1 per cent) of sales revenue, reflecting its emphasis on technology.
COMMENT
Whatman's management has succeeded in deflecting a slow-down in several core
areas, through its expansion into new products. Further acquisitions are
desirable, given low gearing and Whatman's emphasis on higher technology,
but short-term growth will remain steady. On forecast 1993 earnings of
Pounds 12.5m, the shares are trading on a p/e of 15.5. Given the current
business outlook, this represents fair value.

FT  24 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Barr &amp; Wallace rises on back of motor side
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A stronger contribution from its motor distribution operations enabled Barr
&amp; Wallace Arnold Trust to record a 19 per cent improvement in pre-tax
profits to Pounds 4.4m for the year to end-December.
Although the motor side's contribution to overall turnover was static at
Pounds 138m, the division benefited from greater operational efficiency and
enhanced margins and lifted profits by Pounds 1.1m to Pounds 2.43m.
The leisure and holiday activities increased market share but trading
conditions remained difficult. Their contribution to profits fell from
Pounds 3.1m to Pounds 2.27m.
Group turnover expanded from Pounds 227m to Pounds 233m. Earnings worked
through at 22.7p (19.1p) and a final dividend of 8p raises the total by 1p
to 11p.
Looking ahead, the directors anticipated a further improvement in profits
during 1994, 'particularly from the motor operation which has had an
excellent start to the year'.
They were also looking for complementary acquisitions to enhance all
divisions.
Year-end borrowings were reduced by 21.5 per cent to Pounds 15.9m and a
further reduction was looked for in 1994.
The company's ordinary shares closed 18p lower at 605p while the A shares
shed 12p at 314p.

Clinton Cards, the specialist retailer, reported further progress in the
year to January 29 as profits continued their recovery from Pounds 2.31m to
Pounds 3.02m pre-tax. Turnover, ex VAT, was higher at Pounds 75.9m against
Pounds 68.2m.
There was a 15 per cent rise in operating profits to Pounds 3.46m (Pounds
3.01m). The pre-tax figure was further helped by lower net interest charges
of Pounds 439,000 (Pounds 701,000).
Earnings per share came out at 11.61p (9.76p) and a final dividend of 3.11p
is recommended for a total of 4.71p (4.25p).

Pre-tax profits of Aspen Communications, the provider of media communication
services traded on the USM, fell from Pounds 1.83m to Pounds 157,000 in
1993.
The result was after exceptional charges of Pounds 1.13m including Pounds
630,000 for bad and doubtful debts and redundancies and Pounds 1.23m in
respect of goodwill previously written off. There was also an exceptional
gain of Pounds 1.1m on the disposal of an associated undertaking.
Turnover rose from Pounds 60.3m to Pounds 64.2m. Losses per share emerged at
2.6p (8.6p earnings). A proposed final dividend of 2.9p maintains the total
at 4.9p.

FT  24 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Automotive side behind rise to Pounds 1.97m
at Ricardo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ricardo Group, the engineering consultancy, more than doubled pre-tax
profits for the six months to end-December.
They rose from Pounds 875,000 to Pounds 1.97m on turnover of Pounds 30.1m.
The previous turnover of Pounds 31.7m included Pounds 2.92m from the
discontinued technical publications business.
The 1992 figures also showed a loss of Pounds 197,000 from the technical
publishing division, sold in spring 1992, as well as interest payments of
Pounds 54,000 from discontinued operations. The group also took a Pounds
650,000 exceptional property charge.
Stripping out the exceptional items leaves profit on continuing activities
before tax for the first half up nearly 11 per cent from Pounds 1.78m to
Pounds 1.97m.
Mr Christopher Ross, chief executive, attributed the rise to the continued
strong performance of the automotive division, one of the top three in the
world. This had won market share, although at some cost to margins. Its
turnover rose from Pounds 10.9m to Pounds 14.1m.
Turnover in the nuclear-based high technology division also rose, from
Pounds 5.6m to Pounds 6.4m. But the aerospace division's sales fell from
Pounds 12.2m to Pounds 9.5m, reflecting the downturn in the world industry.
Net interest payable on continuing operations fell from Pounds 191,000 to
Pounds 118,000, and gearing at the year end was under 4 per cent (20.2 per
cent).
Earnings per share were up from 1p to 3.9p. The interim dividend has been
raised from 1.9p to 2p.
Mr Ross said the prospects for this year were good. The group had launched a
limited slip differential gear, aimed at the family car and patented
worldwide. 'We now have to turn a technical success into a commercial
success.'
Earlier this week Ricardo added a further division with the acquisition for
Dollars 2.26m (Pounds 1.54m) of Airflow Sciences Corporation, a
Detroit-based company that looks at fluid flow and heat transfer problems.
'It has few competitors and is a science we can already understand and
manage,' said Mr Ross.

FT  24 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Standard Chartered plans expansion in
Thailand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BANGKOK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Standard Chartered, the London-based banking group, intends to expand its
already profitable operations in Thailand and the rest of Asia, Mr Patrick
Gillam, chairman, said.
Mr Gillam said Standard Chartered had received preliminary approval from the
Thai central bank for a debt underwriting licence and would attempt to
obtain an equity underwriting licence.
It was also considering opening 'up country' offshore banking offices to
serve clients outside Bangkok under Thailand's Bangkok International Banking
Facility (BIBF).
Pre-tax profit from Standard Chartered Bank's single branch in Bangkok rose
30 per cent last year to Bt606m, on revenue of Bt1.87bn.
Profits were boosted by strong treasury and custodial business.
'Our areas of expansion also include making a strong move into the private
client business and derivative products business,' said Mr Gillam, who is in
Thailand to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the bank's opening in the
country.
Standard Chartered Bank recently increased its registered capital in
Thailand by a quarter to Bt1bn and intends to increase it further.
Mr Gillam expressed concern that Thailand's competitiveness was being eroded
by the shortcomings of its education system and by delays in implementing
big transport infrastructure projects.
But he praised the government's policy of financial liberalisation.
Mr Gillam reiterated that Standard Chartered wanted to increased its
presence in China, where it already has the largest branch network of any
foreign bank.
He confirmed that the company planned to apply for secondary listings of its
shares on the Hong Kong and Singapore stock exchanges.

FT  24 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Lasmo sells Ninian interests on which
company was based
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lasmo, the independent oil exploration and production company, yesterday did
the corporate equivalent of selling off the family silver.
In a deal which saw the company sell its interests in the Ninian field to
Sun Oil and Ranger Oil for Pounds 84m in cash and Sun's 20 per cent interest
in the new Birch field, the management released the asset on which the
company's fortunes were founded.
The Ninian sale also marked the end of the disposal programme which followed
its Dollars 1bn acquisition in 1992 of Ultramar, the event which analysts
cite as being the start of the company's present troubles.
Mr Joe Darby, chief executive, yesterday said he was prepared for a negative
reaction from some board members when he brought the sale before them.
It was Ninian's discovery in 1974 which transformed a venture capital
company, formed in the early 1970s to look for oil at the start of the North
Sea's exploration phase, into a fully fledged oil company. It was the cash
flow from Ninian which allowed the company to expand, mainly through
acquisition.
The board, however, thought the sale 'was exactly the right thing to do,'
said Mr Darby. 'We got excellent value for a mature, high cost field.'
The sale was the latest in a series of asset disposals the company has made
recently to bolster a financial position that has been undermined by low oil
prices.
Late last year it sold a package of assets, including a 5 per cent stake in
its main development project, the Liverpool Bay gas field, to PowerGen for
Pounds 123m.
However it has recently taken the Markham gas field off the market and Mr
Darby said yesterday: 'The bulk of the disposal of assets are over. There
may be some swaps . . . but I don't see any major asset disposals this
year.'
Analysts say the sale of Ninian symbolises Lasmo's strategy to shift its
production away from high cost reserves. These have led to the company
having a cost of sales per barrel of Pounds 8.15, compared with present
sterling oil prices of about Pounds 9.30.
Chevron, Ninian's operators, say there is scope for steady cost reductions
in coming years and additional potential as technology enables companies to
extract greater amounts of a reservoir.
Lasmo is in a hurry, however, to implement its new low cost strategy, which
it says should reduce its operating costs per barrel to Pounds 3.70 this
year, compared with Pounds 4.10 last year and Pounds 5 in 1991.

FT  24 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Barratt more than doubled to Pounds 11.3m -
Marketing campaign planned for this summer will involve four show villages
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The housing market recovery in the UK is gathering pace, with sales and
prices expected to rise further in 1994 according to Sir Lawrie Barratt,
chairman of Barratt Developments which more than doubled pre-tax profits
from Pounds 4.8m to Pounds 11.3m in the six months to end-December.
Earnings per share increased from 2p to 4.4p, enabling Barratt to increase
its interim dividend to 2p (1p).
Turnover rose by 25 per cent to Pounds 218.2m (Pounds 174m).
Sir Lawrie also announced the group's biggest marketing campaign, which will
take place this summer and include the construction of four separate show
villages to take advantage of the recovery and launch the company's new
range of designs.
The Barratt chairman came out of retirement three years ago after the group
began to incur heavy losses. He said yesterday that the group was on course
to achieve its target of increasing production from 5,000 to 8,000 homes a
year by June 1996.
Sir Lawrie will become non-executive chairman from the beginning of August.
Mr Frank Eaton, chief executive, said the company was in good shape to
finance its expansion with net debt of only Pounds 53.4m, including
off-balance sheet loans, representing gearing of 27 per cent.
He expected sales by UK housebuilders to rise by about 10 per cent in 1994
with UK house prices rising by 7 per cent and up to 10 per cent in
south-east England.
The group completed 2,302 UK sales in the half year, 14 per cent more than
in the corresponding period. Operating margins rose from 6.3 per cent to 8.6
per cent.
The group said it had continued to buy land at prices which would provide
satisfactory margins, acquiring 4,593 plots at an average price of Pounds
14,457 during the first half, equivalent to 19.9 per cent of the present
average selling price of Pounds 72,500.
Total UK land holdings had risen by 11 per cent since last June to 15,079
plots representing 2 1/2 years supply at current production rates.
The southern Californian housing market was expected to remain much more
difficult although US losses had fallen by 50 per cent to Dollars 700,000
(Pounds 480,000).
There was also a Pounds 300,000 loss on leisure and time-share activities.
This was more than offset by profits from commercial property sales and the
group's Scottish contracting operations.
COMMENT
Frank Eaton deserves much of the credit for the turnround at Barratt. Good
housekeeping in terms of reduced costs, shrewd land purchasing and Sir
Lawrie's marketing skills has provided UK operating margins of about 11 per
cent currently. This should rise further next year, putting the group at the
top end of the range for a large national volume builder. On pre-tax profits
of Pounds 33m this year the group is on a prospective p/e of 20, falling to
14 times earnings of Pounds 50m in 1994-95. On this basis much of the
stock's virtue is already in the price but still worth a buy if only because
Barratt historically has performed well during an upturn.

FT  24 MAR 94 / UK Company News: UniChem advances 27% in challenging markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UniChem, the pharmaceuticals wholesaler and retailer, increased 1993 profits
by 27 per cent to Pounds 37.5m, against Pounds 29.4m, despite the 2.5 per
cent cut in drugs price imposed by the government in October.
Mr Jeff Harris, chief executive, described it as an 'outstanding performance
during a year of challenging market conditions'.
In addition to the price cut UniChem faced intensified competition from
rivals, notably Lloyds Chemists which is trying to build market share in
wholesaling.
However Mr Harris said UniChem was losing very little business and predicted
that the 'crazy' discounts being offered by competitors would not last much
longer.
Turnover advanced 12 per cent to Pounds 1.18bn (Pounds 1.05bn), with
pharmaceutical wholesaling showing like-for-like growth of more than 10 per
cent in a market which grew by about 9 per cent. Operating profits rose by
17 per cent to Pounds 40.1m, compared with Pounds 34.2m, and margins
increased from 3.25 per cent to 3.4 per cent.
Earnings per share rose to 17.8p (13.7p) basic or 17.3p (13.4p) fully
diluted. Dividends increased 15 per cent to 6.5p (5.65p) with a recommended
final of 4.3p.
The market share gain stemmed partly from large manufacturers cutting down
on direct distribution and from the growth in sales to hospitals which, up
50 per cent to Pounds 44m.
UniChem estimates that the market will grow by 10 per cent this year,
somewhat less than the Government's recent prediction.
The rapidly growing Moss Chemists retail chain increased sales from Pounds
79.7m to Pounds 114m generating operating profits of Pounds 6.6m (Pounds
4.9m). Operating margins slipped from 6.1 per cent to 5.8 per cent and are
expected to remain flat.
In November UniChem paid Pounds 8.9m for Bradford Chemists' Alliance, a
regional wholesaler. Mr Harris said a number of the remaining regional
wholesalers were interested in being acquired but added: 'We will have to
look at them but very few will be worth going for.'
COMMENT
These figures may indeed represent an 'outstanding' performance in
'challenging' conditions but it must be said that UniChem has a great deal
going for it. Despite the Government price cut its market showed healthy
growth which is likely to continue. Its 30 per cent market share gives it a
huge advantage over the dwindling band of regionals while the strong
relationship between wholesaler and chemist has blunted Lloyds' efforts to
poach its customers. In wholesaling there are further gains to come from
depot automation and in retailing there are new opportunities as big selling
prescription medicines are switched to over-the-counter. After a good run
this year these strengths are better reflected in the share price which now
stands at about 16.5 times prospective earnings.

FT  24 MAR 94 / UK Company News: W Canning falls to Pounds 2.2m but better
year in prospect
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits at W Canning, the Birmingham-based speciality chemicals and
electronic components group, took their expected knock from a provision for
bad debts and fell from Pounds 2.43m to Pounds 2.21m for 1993.
Last month Canning reported a Pounds 1.4m provision against an exposure of
Pounds 1.9m at its Italian electrical components business and noted
yesterday that the size of the debt 'reflects the extended credit given to
customers, which is normal business practice in Italy.'
The effect meant a cut in attributable earnings of Pounds 536,000, taking
them down to Pounds 610,000 against Pounds 260,000 in 1992.
Basic earnings per share worked through at 2.2p (0.9p). However, adjusting
for the exceptional and bad debt provisions adjusted earnings emerged at
7.8p (7.2p). A maintained final dividend of 4.35p makes a same-again 7.29p
total.
Mr David Probert, chairman, said he did not feel that a reduced dividend
would be justified given the strength of the Canning balance sheet and
market prospects.
The difficulties in Italy obscured an improvement in the group's performance
last year. Sales in fact were lower at Pounds 109.31m (Pounds 114.03m) after
the sale of the French company. However, profits before the debt provision
and the exceptional item associated with that sale rose from Pounds 4.04m to
Pounds 4.67m.
Trading during the first 10 weeks of the current year was described as
'satisfactory'. Sales in and from the UK have increased, while the French
and German markets, which take half of Canning's sales, have stopped
declining. This year will be better than last, Mr Probert said.

FT  24 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Bernard Matthews tops Pounds 11m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bernard Matthews, the turkey products group which has been hit by weak
prices in recent years, appears to be back in full flight with annual
pre-tax profits rising sharply from Pounds 3.34m to Pounds 11.3m.
Sales were 35 per cent higher at Pounds 195m for the 52 weeks to January 2.
Acquisitions contributed Pounds 28m of the sales increase, leaving
continuing businesses 16 per cent ahead.
Mr Bernard Matthews, the founder and chairman, said the improvement was
largely due to a recovery in prices for whole turkeys and a greater focus on
frozen and added value products, such as dinosaur shaped turkey meat.
'The market for whole birds improved significantly during 1993,' said Mr
Matthews. 'We lost several million pounds on that in 1992 and have recovered
from that in 1993.'
Bernard Matthews had also decreased its dependence on whole birds from 18
per cent to 10 per cent of total sales through acquisitions and new products
such as cooked meat.
The group suffered substantial start-up losses in France, where it has
invested between Pounds 4m and Pounds 5m in advertising its frozen products.
Mr Matthews said this business was now trading profitably, excluding
advertising costs. Germany was progressing and the group was 'extending its
distribution of value added products'.
Mr Matthews said his company, which made two acquisitions last year,
remained in an 'aggressive mood'. Further buys could not be ruled out.
Last year the company bought Hungary's leading turkey company for Pounds
2.5m and Turners Turkeys from Unigate for Pounds 18m. The purchases
contributed Pounds 2.06m to total operating profit of Pounds 12.3m (Pounds
3.91m).
Debt rose from 9 per cent of shareholders' funds to 12 per cent as a result
of the acquisitions. Mr Matthews said the company remained well placed for
further acquisitions. However, he stressed any deals would be funded
internally. 'This company is not in the rights issue business,' he said.
The final dividend is increased to 1.4p (1.25p) for a 2.5p (2.25p) total,
payable from earnings up by 4.63p to 6.27p.

FT  24 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Britannic Assurance rises 13.6% to Pounds
27.9m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britannic Assurance, the life assurance company, yesterday reported pre-tax
profits up 13.6 per cent to Pounds 27.9m in the year to December 31.
Earnings per share rose 14 per cent to 14.4p, against 12.64p in 1992 after
an adjustment for a capitalisation issue.
Mr Brian Shaw, general manager and actuary, said: 'We think it was a further
steady, sound year for Britannic. We were regarded as rather conservative a
few years ago for sticking to our core business. That is now regarded as a
rather sensible strategy.'
The company said it had made a provision within its reserves to cover any
compensation that might arise as a result of the Securities and Investments
Board's review of the sale of personal pensions. Mr Shaw said the sum was
not going to be material to profits or shareholders.
Net premium income was Pounds 468m (Pounds 417m), including Pounds 126m
(Pounds 123m) contributed by the company's industrial branch. General branch
premium income rose to Pounds 34.8m (Pounds 30.5m).
Life annual premiums were Pounds 58.4m (Pounds 53.8m) and single premiums
were Pounds 51m (Pounds 32.7m). Pensions annual premiums were Pounds 37.6m
(Pounds 33.4m), single premiums Pounds 76.6m (Pounds 73.3m) and contracted
out rebates Pounds 83.6m (Pounds 70.6m).
General branch pre-tax profits were Pounds 1.1m last year, compared with a
loss of Pounds 414,000 in 1992.
The underwriting division reported losses of Pounds 2.2m (Pounds 3.7m
deficit). This included a loss of Pounds 1.4m (Pounds 2.8m loss) from
property, of Pounds 615,000 (Pounds 1.1m loss) from motor, and a loss of
Pounds 245,000 (Pounds 227,000 profit) from liability policies.
Mr Shaw said that Britannic withdrew about 18 months ago from commercial
insurance.
The net dividend was up nearly 13 per cent to 12.6p.
The tax charge fell 12 per cent to Pounds 774,000. The company made a Pounds
500,000 transfer to its claims equalisation provision.
The shares fell 5p to 455p.

FT  24 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Glaxo grants Wellcome option over 3TC drug
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Glaxo has granted Wellcome an option to develop and market the compound 3TC,
which is in final clinical trials, for treatment of the HIV virus.
Glaxo, which licensed the drug from BioChem Pharma of Canada in 1990, would
continue clinical development of the compound for the treatment of hepatitis
B.
Part of the current trials for HIV involve the use of 3TC in conjunction
with Wellcome's anti-Aids drug Retrovir.
Glaxo said there was increasing evidence that such 'combination therapy' was
the most promising approach to HIV treatment and that the proposed
arrangement would represent the most efficient way of bringing 3TC to
market.
Wellcome is likely to decide whether to exercise the option after the trial
results are available towards the end of this year.
This would trigger a further payment to Glaxo.
Once marketed, Wellcome would make royalty payments to Glaxo based on sales
and Glaxo in turn would pay royalties to BioChem Pharma.
Glaxo has an 17 per cent stake in BioChem, a research-based pharmaceuticals
company formed in 1986 which is quoted on the Montreal and Toronto stock
exchanges and on Nasdaq.

FT  24 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Exceptionals conceal growth at Lex Service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lex Service, the UK's largest car distribution and leasing group, yesterday
reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 101.5m for 1993 compared with Pounds 107m
the previous year.
The figures for the past year were boosted by a Pounds 60.1m profit on the
sale of Arrow Electronics shares and by a 'fifth' quarter of profits
amounting to Pounds 2.6m from the leasing associates which changed their
year ends from October to December.
Excluding distorting exceptional items in both years profits increased by 36
per cent to Pounds 38.5m (Pounds 28.3m). Turnover grew by 29 per cent to
Pounds 1.18bn (Pounds 910.7m).
Sir Trevor Chinn, chairman and chief executive, said this underlying profit
improvement reflected the encouraging growth in the UK car and track
markets. 'Our businesses improved their profits substantially through
increased market shares and continued tight control of costs,' he said.
Earnings per share slipped to 88.5p (96.7p) but an increased final dividend
of 7.8p (6.6p) is recommended, making a 12.5p (10.6p) total. The shares
closed down 6p at 524p yesterday.
The group's expanded 127 car and truck dealerships, representing over 30
manufacturers, sold 64,000 new and 30,000 used vehicles last year, increases
of 30 per cent and 22 per respectively.
Trading profit, including an Pounds 800,000 contribution from the Arlington
dealerships acquired in July, was Pounds 18.8m (Pounds 11.4m) reflecting the
increased market share, improved operations and the full year contribution
of the Swan dealerships acquired in 1992.
Lex Vehicle Leasing, Transfleet and Harvey, which are jointly owned with
Lombard North Central, all increased their fleet sizes. This, combined with
the benefits of the operational improvement implemented over the past two
years, led all to all three achieving record profits.
Together the three companies and Lex Systems Leasing contributed Pounds 19m
to Lex for the 12 months to December 1993, compared with Pounds 9.8m for the
corresponding period in 1992.
Net interest costs were reduced from Pounds 4.3m to Pounds 2.2m and year end
net borrowings stood at Pounds 14m (Pounds 9m).
The group also announced the appointment of Mr Peter Harris as finance
director.
COMMENT
Over the past three years Lex has made considerable progress towards its
twin goals of expanding the scale of the company and improving its
operational performance. The group's strong balance sheet provides the
flexibility for further acquisitions, and developing existing operations
like the Lucas Autocentres. Pre-tax profits of about Pounds 48m are expected
this year - excluding Pounds 7m from the sale of the final tranche of Arrow
shares in January. Earnings, before exceptionals, should be around 32p and
the shares are trading on a prospective p/e of 16.4.

FT  24 MAR 94 / UK Company News: BMW begins creating new management links
with Rover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Bernd Pischetsrieder, chairman of the BMW management board, has taken
over as chairman of the board of Rover Group, following the completion last
week of the German carmaker's Pounds 800m takeover of the UK vehicle
producer.
Mr John Towers, previously Rover group managing director, has been appointed
chief executive.
The company said the remaining Rover directors had all been confirmed in
their positions. Mr Pischetsrieder said BMW was committed to maintaining
Rover as a separately managed British company.
Mr Wolfgang Reitzle, BMW research and development director, said in an
interview that BMW intended to set up joint committees between the two
groups in the key areas of research and development, sales and purchasing.
Initially the most intense discussions have taken place over Rover's
long-term product plan with key decisions to be taken over a replacement
strategy both for Rover's Mini and its 800 executive car.
BMW is also preparing for its negotiations with Honda over changes the
Japanese carmaker is seeking in the terms and conditions of its various
licensing deals with Rover.
Mr Reitzle said that BMW was still interested in long-term collaboration
with Honda for key components for front-wheel drive cars.
'At BMW we do not have frontwheel drive components, and it would be very
expensive for Rover to develop these on its own,' he said.

WHITECROFT has sold two properties in the south east of England for Pounds
1.72m cash. The value of property awaiting disposal in the balance sheet at
March 31 was Pounds 14.4m and this figure has now fallen to Pounds 6.5m. The
transactions - further steps towards complete withdrawal from property
development - have reduced borrowings and showed a small surplus over book

FT  24 MAR 94 / UK Company News: 14.4% take up CSC offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Pounds 73m public offer for Capital Shopping Centres, one of the largest
flotations of 1994, has been only 14.4 per cent subscribed by the public.
The remaining 85.6 per cent will be taken up by institutions.
The public offer for the regional shopping centre company was affected by
adverse conditions in the stock market, but brokers argue that it was too
aggressively priced. The shares were issued at a 13 per cent premium to
asset value.
However, Mr Donald Gordon, chairman of TransAtlantic - the insurance and
property group which retains a 75 per cent stake in CSC - said that CSC had
achieved its objectives in the offer.
He said: 'We have got a good share register, and hopefully not too many
stags in the wings'. He said CSC had always been marketed as a long-term
institutional stock, and the only reason for the public offer was the
'insistence of the Stock Exchange'.
Robert Fleming, the lead sponsor, placed 65 per cent of the Pounds 209m
offer with institutions, and the remaining 35 per cent was placed subject to
clawback for the public offer. The public have taken up 4.58m shares, out of
the available 31.85m.
Mr Gordon said that the total offer had been over-subscribed by institutions
and that these would remain committed to the company, despite the reaction
of the public. 'I think we priced it dead right', he said.
Few have argued about the quality of the company, which has a unique and
defensive property portfolio, but a number of institutions suggested the
shares were expensive.
At the time the offer was first announced, the property sector was trading
at an average premium to asset value of about 20 per cent. According to
Warburg Securities, the premium has now narrowed to 5 per cent.
Some brokers have suggested that the shares could trade at about 210p,
compared with the issue price of 230p, after dealings begin next Wednesday.

FT  24 MAR 94 / UK Company News: UK retailing operation proves to be an
uphill struggle for Kingfisher
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The high street proved to be an uphill struggle for Kingfisher last year, as
it revealed lower than expected profits from most of its UK retail divisions
in its results yesterday.
The most severe difficulties were encountered at Woolworths, which recently
saw the departure of its managing director.
'The simple fact is that after a very good first half in toys, Woolworths
overbought,' said Sir Geoffrey Mulcahy, chairman.
The division was forced to cut prices substantially to get rid of stock.
Woolworths was further hit by an unexpected collapse in the video consoles
and games market, which forced a profits warning from both Kingfisher and
its rival, Dixons, earlier this year.
Although he would not quantify the extent of the damage inflicted by these
events, Sir Geoffrey said it was substantially greater than the Pounds 3.3m
decline in profits to Pounds 74.5m. Sales were 7 per cent higher at Pounds
1.3bn.
Sir Geoffrey stressed that other lines that Woolworths offered were up to
expectations. 'Excluding toys and games, gross profit rose by 10 per cent in
the second half,' he said.
Superdrug also had a difficult year, with operating profit falling by 9.5
per cent to Pounds 31.5m. However, sales were 5 per cent up at Pounds 617m,
with a 2.5 per cent increase in comparable turnover.
Sir Geoffrey attributed the profits decline to disruption caused by a shift
in focus. In future the division would concentrate on personal care
products, moving away from household and grocery ranges.
B&amp;Q, the Do-It-Yourself retailer, did better, with profits rising from
Pounds 81.1m to Pounds 82m, on sales 10 per cent higher at Pounds 1.15bn.
Like-for-like sales were 4 per cent ahead. Sir Geoffrey said the improvement
at B&amp;Q proved Kingfisher's strategy of every day low prices was working.
Darty, the French electricals retailer acquired last year for Pounds 1bn,
had proved resilient in a difficult market, Sir Geoffrey said. Sales for the
relevant eight months were down by 2.7 per cent to Pounds 694m, and
operating profits 6 per cent lower at Pounds 79.2m. However, the sales
performance compared well with the overall decline of 4.3 per cent in the
French electricals market, Sir Geoffrey said.
Comet's profits fell by 7 per cent to Pounds 16.4m on sales 6 per cent
higher at Pounds 526m. A sharp fall in sales in the second half held back
the like-for-like advance to 0.7 per cent.

FT  24 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Bowthorpe 20% ahead to Pounds 51m - US
subsidiaries were main growth area with 35% of operating profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bowthorpe, the international electronic and electrical components group,
yesterday reported a 20 per cent increase in 1993 pre-tax profits to Pounds
51.1m, slightly ahead of forecasts made in mid-December when the group
announced a successful Pounds 64.4m rights issue.
The result, described by Mr John Westhead, chief executive, as 'pleasing'
given 'the tough economic environment,' compares with pre-tax profits of
Pounds 42.7m in 1992.
Turnover grew by 26 per cent to Pounds 334m (Pounds 265m), including Pounds
9.3m from acquisitions and Pounds 27.3m attributed to translation gains.
The US produced 34 per cent (29 per cent) of group turnover, the UK
accounted for an unchanged 31 per cent and continental Europe contributed 28
per cent (32 per cent). The fastest growing region for sales was Asia which
generated turnover of Pounds 21m (Pounds 13m.)
Operating profits increased by 24 per cent to Pounds 52.5m (Pounds 42.3m) of
which Pounds 2.1m came from 1993 acquisitions and Pounds 5.3m arose on
translation.
The group's US subsidiaries were the main area of growth, generating 35 per
cent of overall operating profits, compared with 31 per cent.
Most of the profit growth came from the electronics segment with operating
profits of Pounds 34.4m (Pounds 26.3m) helped by profits growth in the
European terminals market and by strong gains in the US computer and medical
markets for electro-ceramics businesses.
The electrical businesses also reported a 13 per cent increase in operating
profits to Pounds 18.1m (Pounds 16m) with a broadly based recovery in the US
offsetting the sharp reduction in demand experienced by the European cable
care operations.
Profits were reduced by net interest costs of Pounds 1.44m (Pounds 381,000
received). Bowthorpe ended the year with net borrowings of Pounds 41.5m,
equivalent to gearing of 54 per cent, after capital expenditure of Pounds
22.7m (Pounds 19.6m) and acquisitions totalling Pounds 39.6m of which Pounds
32.5m was paid in cash.
Earnings per share increased by 18 per cent to 18.18p (15.36p) helped by a
reduced effective rate of taxation of 32 per cent (35.5 per cent). As
forecast, a final dividend of 5.03p (4.57p) is proposed for a total up 8.6
per cent at 6.91p (6.36p.)
COMMENT
Despite less than ideal market conditions around the globe Bowthorpe
continues to deliver underlying profit growth. The rights issue proceeds
will enable the group to pursue its successful strategy of building global
niche businesses, and perhaps to expand further in the fast growing Asian
market. This year pre-tax profits of about Pounds 59m are likely although
earnings are expected to be flat, held back by the dilutive effects of the
rights issue and a more normal tax charge of about 35 per cent. The shares
slipped 3p to 347p yesterday and are trading on a forward multiple of around
19.2 but could go higher.

FT  24 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Dagenham Motors recovers to Pounds 2.35m
and seeks Pounds 9.9m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dagenham Motors, the south-east of England Ford dealer group, is raising
Pounds 9.9m through a 2-for-5 rights issue, its first share issue since the
company was floated in 1988.
The group increased its pre-tax profits by 58 per cent to Pounds 2.35m
(Pounds 1.48m) for the year to December 31 ending four years of decline.
Before the recession profits peaked at Pounds 4m in 1988.
The dividend is being raised to 6.25p per share (5.75p) with a recommended
final of 4.5p. Earnings per share came out at 8.7p, compared with 5.6p.
The company is issuing 6.77m new shares at 153p per share. The shares closed
yesterday unchanged at 193p. The issue will be underwritten by Samuel
Montagu.
Mr David Philip, chairman and managing director, said that profits in the
first two months of 1994 were substantially ahead of the corresponding
period helped by the continuing strong recovery in the UK new vehicle
market.
New car sales rose by 19 per cent, used car sales by 27 per cent and new
commercial vehicle sales by 32 per cent in the first two months.
Group turnover for 1993 rose by 20 per cent to Pounds 187.3m (Pounds
155.9m). The figures were supported by an 11 per cent rise in new car sales
to 8,580, a 10 per cent increase in used car sales to 6,896 and a 56 per
cent jump in sales of new commercial vehicles.
Dagenham Motors remains an exclusive Ford (cars and light commercial
vehicles) and Iveco Ford (medium and heavy duty commercial vehicles) dealer
group, but it is seeking to increase business in all-makes used car and
after sales operations and in accident repair.
Mr Philip said that the rights issue would help to reduce gearing from 125
per cent to 45 per cent and would give 'maximum flexibility in our pursuit
of acquisition oppor-tunities'.
It would also provide a sound base for 'the anticipated strong growth in the
group's existing operations', which include seven Ford new car dealerships
and two Iveco Ford commercial vehicle outlets in south-east England.
The group was seeking additional Ford dealerships in or around the M25
circle, where it currently operated.
By exercising outstanding options Mr Philip is raising his stake in the
group from 8.3 to 9.1 per cent. The biggest outside shareholder is 3i with
12.8 per cent.

FT  24 MAR 94 / Darty helps Kingfisher to Pounds 309m: Analysts concerned
with retailer's underlying performance despite 51% rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kingfisher shares fell yesterday in spite of better than expected results,
reflecting disappointment over the retailer's underlying performance in the
UK.
Pre-tax profits of Pounds 309.3m, a rise of 51 per cent, were about Pounds
10m ahead of expectations. Sales rose 26.3 per cent to Pounds 4.48bn.
The profits advance was largely fuelled by a Pounds 79.2m operating
contribution from Darty, the French electricals retailer acquired in
February last year for Pounds 1bn. Profits were further cushioned by a lower
than expected interest charge of Pounds 7.6m (Pounds 700,000) and a rise in
the property contribution from Pounds 8.1m to Pounds 43m.
Operating profits from the main UK retailing businesses, where Kingfisher
launched a strategy of everyday low pricing last year, fell 3 per cent.
One analyst described the returns from Comet, Woolworths, B&amp;Q and Superdrug
as 'a bit disappointing'. 'It would appear that the strategy is not
delivering great profit growth.'
The shares fell 9p to 561p, and have dropped 22 per cent since January's
trading statement after which analysts downgraded expectations from Pounds
315m to Pounds 300m. Analysts also indicated that 1995 forecasts would be
pulled back.
Sir Geoffrey Mulcahy, chairman, rejected criticism of the low price policy.
'It is designed to attack the lower growth and more competitive retail
environment of the 1990s,' he said. 'I am convinced that strategy is right
and it is working.'
Kingfisher has decided to step up introduction of electronic points of sale
throughout the group to cut costs and reinforce the strategy. Sir Geoffrey
said Epos would be in every store by the Christmas trading period.
He was pleased with the results, which had demonstrated the 'soundness of
both Kingfisher's businesses and its balance sheet'. Debt was reduced from
66 per cent of shareholders' funds to 33 per cent.
Darty had been 'particularly encouraging', said Sir Geoffrey, 'given the
recession in France'. The group had increased market share in an intensely
competitive environment, and deliberately avoided chasing lower-margin
volume.
The chairman would not comment on current trading. However, Kingfisher has
decided to make two trading statements a year in addition to announcing its
results. The next statement is due in June.
The dividend was raised 10 per cent to 10.5p, for a total 9 per cent higher
at 14.9p.
Fully diluted earnings rose 15 per cent to 36.9p.

FT  24 MAR 94 / Allied Dunbar to take over Hill Samuel's life sellers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hill Samuel, part of the TSB group, is to close the life and pensions part
of its financial services arm to new business. Most of its direct sales
force will be offered jobs at Allied Dunbar, the BAT subsidiary.
In return for what Allied Dunbar called a small payment, it will have the
option to recruit the 600-plus sales force.
The move is a sign of much-expected rationalisation within the crowded life
industry. The transfer will mean a significant increase in size for Allied
Dunbar, which has 4,300 sales agents.
The decision also marks a further step in TSB's strategy for Hill Samuel,
which is to focus on its merchant banking and investment management
activities.
The Hill Samuel concern will be saved the cost of attracting sales, although
it will continue to service existing life and pension policyholders. The
funds will be managed by its investment management arm.
In the year to October 1993, profits in the financial services business fell
by Pounds 4m to Pounds 13m - despite higher sales of unit trusts - as
customers switched out of life products. Hill Samuel will continue to market
products such as unit trusts through independent financial advisers.
Mr Hugh Freedberg, Hill Samuel group chief executive, said the
restructuring, which will take place next month, followed a strategic review
begun last year.
This concluded, he said, that a life company needed 'a warm, captive
customer base, or direct selling with sufficient size and scale to be able
to compete profitably and effectively'. HSFS had neither.
Mr Sandy Leitch, Allied Dunbar chief executive, said the life company was
determined to occupy a 'dominant' market position. The acquisition was its
first for more than 10 years.

FT  24 MAR 94 / Sunset in the east for Jardine Matheson's stock: Simon
Holberton reports on group's delisting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Jardine Matheson, the British trading company, is to cease trading its
shares on the Hong Kong stock exchange at the end of this year.
Mr Henry Keswick, chairman, said yesterday Jardine had been unable to
persuade the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), Hong Kong's corporate
watchdog, to relinquish its regulatory oversight of the company in favour of
arrangements which Jardine had entered into with the authorities in Bermuda,
its place of incorporation.
The Bermudan authorities have brought the group under a statutory version of
the London Takeover Code. The SFC did not believe the Bermudan authorities
had the experience to regulate a Hong Kong-listed company.
Jardine's announcement brings to an end a 10-year process of disengagement
from Hong Kong's regulatory regime. In 1984 it moved its domicile to
Bermuda; in 1991 it moved its primary stock exchange listing to London.
Jardine's shares have been traded in Hong Kong since 1961. Its decision to
delist seems a sad move for a company which can trace its antecedents back
to the 1830s in Canton. It was on the encouragement of Mr William Jardine,
one of the company's co-founders, that Lord Palmerston agreed to the
occupation of Chinese territory to promote Anglo-Chinese trade. This led to
the seizure of Hong Kong in 1841.
But the company has had a chequered relationship with China. It made its
fortune trading opium and built China's first railway. Jardine executives
ran the Shanghai municipal council until the revolution; Sir John Keswick,
friend of Chinese premier Zhou Enlai, signed over Jardine's assets to the
communists.
The decision to quit the Hong Kong stock exchange was visceral rather than
logical. Sir Charles Powell, a Jardine director argued it was a technical
measure to complete a process of bringing the company under UK law, begging
the question of why it was necessary to do so in the first place.
Jardine's top managers - the brothers Henry and Simon Keswick - lack faith
in the ability of the SFC and stock exchange to administer a level playing
field in the colony after China resumes sovereignty in 1997. Jardine, which
employed 250,000 people in China in 1949 when the Communist Party assumed
power, fears the possibility of asset appropriation through arbitrary
decision making by regulators. In any case, its corporate roots are
increasingly in the UK: through Hongkong Land, Jardine moved last year to
control Trafalgar House, the construction and engineering group, and through
Dairy Farm International it controls KwikSave, the food retailer.
Under the arrangements which Jardine has fashioned for itself, the final
judicial arbiter in any legal dispute will be the Privy Council in London;
in Hong Kong post-1997, the final arbiter would be the standing committee of
the Chinese National People's Congress.
Jardine's decision put the SFC in an impossible position. The SFC would have
been endorsing Jardine's view of post-1997 Hong Kong had it agreed to let
the Bermudan authorities regulate the company while it remained listed in
Hong Kong.
The company's fears appear to be limited to itself as yesterday stock prices
in Hong Kong rose strongly. A lot of market activity was centred on
investors chasing stocks which might be candidates for the Hang Seng Index
slots which Jardine will relinquish.
Mr Charles Lee, chairman of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, pointed out that
Jardine Matheson accounted for only 1.66 per cent of the stock market's
capitalisation. The stock exchange saw its future with China.
Jardine's position on the mainland must be under question. It has one of the
largest business presences in China: 60 joint ventures and other businesses
with turnover of about Dollars 1bn (Pounds 670m) a year. This is despite
selling HKDollars 7.4bn (Pounds 643m) of assets in Hong Kong since 1989,
according to Peregrine, a local brokerage. Mr Nigel Rich, Jardine taipan,
did not expect delisting to have a significant impact on the company's
business in China.
It is possible that Jardine may be able to go about its business more
quietly, without its share price functioning as a barometer of Anglo-Chinese
relations.
The company's recent prospective 1994 price/earnings multiple of 10.5
compared with about 17 for Inchcape, the UK-listed trading group. As
Peregrine said: 'There is a possibility of an upward re-rating of Jardine
Matheson if its principal audience were London and not Hong Kong.'

FT  24 MAR 94 / Weak oil prices take toll on Lasmo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lasmo, one of the UK's largest oil exploration and production companies,
yesterday passed its final dividend as it struggled to come to terms with
continuing oil price weakness.
It reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 9m, against a restated deficit of
Pounds 262m. After tax and dividend payments, the amount withdrawn from
reserves was Pounds 141m. The loss per share was 17.5p, reduced from 52.3p.
The group said the loss attributable to shareholders before exceptional
charges was Pounds 59m, compared with a Pounds 34m profit.
Mr Joe Darby, chief executive, said oil prices lingering around the Dollars
13-Dollars 14 a barrel level for Brent Blend constituted the 'exceptional
circumstances' that caused the board to chop the final dividend. It promised
last year to make a final 2p payout to equal the previous 3.3p total.
'We thought the 1.3p announced at the time of the interim results was
enough,' he said. The decision would save Pounds 20m cash. The future annual
dividend would be 1p, until 'an increase can be justified'.
Low oil prices caused the company to make a Pounds 120m provision against
assets including fields in Nova Scotia and Italy, and a new accommodation
platform at the UK Claymore field. UK tax changes allowed the release of
Pounds 45m provisions, leaving a net exceptional charge of Pounds 72m.
Turnover was Pounds 678m, up from Pounds 621m, as production rose 10 per
cent to 167,000 barrels a day of oil equivalent (including natural gas).
Operating profits totalled Pounds 110m, against Pounds 112m.
Lasmo's vulnerability to low prices was illustrated by an average cost of
sales of Pounds 8.15 a barrel, compared with current sterling price of about
Pounds 9.30. The company aims to trim unit operating costs of Pounds 4.10 a
barrel by 10 per cent this year and by 25 per cent in real terms over the
next four years. A shift towards lower cost production was highlighted by
yesterday's announcement of the Pounds 84m sale of Lasmo's interests in the
high-cost mature Ninian field in the North Sea.
Year-end gearing was reduced from 110 to 75 per cent, on net debt of Pounds
794m. The company has extensive development programmes, and Mr Darby
acknowledged that the target of keeping gearing to 80-90 per cent by 1995
was based on oil prices 'higher than they are today'.

FT  24 MAR 94 / Halifax ready to cut mortgage rate if base rates fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Halifax building society, the UK's largest, said yesterday that if there
were a further 0.25 percentage point cut in base lending rates then it would
reduce its variable mortgage rates.
Announcing a 27 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 866m for
1993-94, the chairman Mr Jon Foulds made it clear, however, that a cut in
rates to borrowers would also mean reductions for savers.
Halifax attracted Pounds 1.1bn in retail savings last year, taking retail
funds and deposits to Pounds 51.6bn, and raised a further Pounds 2.1bn on
the wholesale markets, where funding was cheaper.
Mr Foulds said the society had performed well in the 'fragile market',
although he acknowledged the fierce competition for retail savings. He
highlighted short-term factors such as payment of home fuel bills in advance
of the imposition of Value Added Tax in April, and more permanent features
such as the popularity of unit trusts and Peps.
The society's wholesale funding ratio, at 18.3 per cent of total shares,
deposits and loans, remained well within the statutory limit of 40 per cent.
In the longer term, however, he said the proportion of the balance sheet
from the wholesale markets would have to grow, and so societies would need
wider access to wholesale markets. This is one of the priorities for the
government's review of building society legislation.
Mr Foulds added that he thought there was a 'sea-change' in the pattern of
personal savings. This was one reason for the launch of Halifax Life next
January.
A sharp fall in provisions for bad and doubtful debts - mostly for
residential property - to Pounds 271m, from Pounds 374m in the year to the
end of January 1993, was one factor in the rise, but the level of
provisioning remained higher than in previous years. Mr Foulds believed
there would be significant levels of provisions for a few years to come,
though he was encouraged by the drop in arrears.
Gross lending rose to Pounds 8.6bn, from Pounds 8.3bn, while net lending
fell back slightly to Pounds 3.2bn from Pounds 3.3bn. This represented a
slightly larger share - 19 per cent - of a smaller mortgage market. The
number of advances rose to 1.86m from 1.82m.
The society's total assets rose by 6 per cent to Pounds 67bn. Its
cost/income ratio remained stable at just under 40 per cent.
Losses at Halifax's estate agency fell to Pounds 4m from Pounds 18m, and it
is expected to break even in the current year. Mr Mike Blackburn, chief
executive, said the agency provided 10 per cent of Halifax's mortgage
business, and would remain part of the society's strategy.
Mr Blackburn said Halifax had reservations about the Personal Investment
Authority, the watchdog to protect private investors, and had not yet
decided whether to join. It would prefer full statutory regulation and
doubted the PIA would deliver an increase in investor protection.

FT  24 MAR 94 / Coca-Cola prepares to fight off rival brand challenger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Coca-Cola is going to war in the UK. The world's biggest soft drinks company
is about to launch a multi-million pound advertising, public relations and
political campaign claiming that that there is only one 'real' cola.
The enemy is a company which has only recently arrived here: Cott
Corporation, a fast-growing Canadian bottler and marketer of private label
soft drinks for supermarkets. Cott is at an advanced stage of negotiations
with J Sainsbury and hopes the supermarket chain will launch a cola
sub-brand - one which incorporates both the Sainsbury name and a newly
invented trade name - by the end of May.
Coca-Cola believes it under-estimated the threat from Cott in the Canadian
and North American market three years ago, when the Canadian company began
to launch a series of supermarket sub-brands.
Since then, Cott has acquired a 20 per cent share of the Canadian grocery
market and Coca-Cola has been relegated to third place.
Coca-Cola Beverages, the 49 per cent owned Canadian offshoot of Coca-Cola,
made net losses of CDollars 143m last year and closed half its 16 production
plants.
Now the UK operation has hired a raft of expensive consultancy firms: Bartle
Bogle Hegarty to do television and newspaper advertising; Brunswick for
public relations; and Lowe Bell for strategic marketing advice and political
lobbying as a new trademark bill goes through the House of Commons.
Coca-Cola's war cabinet includes its solicitors, Clifford Chance, whose aim
is to prevent Sainsbury infringing the company's trademarks. Goldman Sachs
has also been approached, although the US investment bank's role has 'yet to
be decided', said one Coca-Cola adviser.
According to the marketing consultancy AC Nielsen, Coca-Cola was the
top-selling grocery brand in the UK last year, with sales of Pounds 247m.
This represents more than 60 per cent by value of the UK retail cola market,
well ahead of Pepsi Cola with more than 20 per cent and supermarket labels
with less than 10 per cent, said OC&amp;C Strategy Consultants.

FT  24 MAR 94 / Whitehall's secrecy rules to be eased
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is to classify fewer documents 'top secret' in a shake-up of
its security system, and it claims that less information will be kept from
the public.
The move, which follows a review, could lead to substantial savings in the
annual Pounds 300m bill for Whitehall security.
Mr John Major announced yesterday that he had approved more detailed
definitions of the four categories by which sensitive documents are
classified. These are: top secret, secret, confidential and restricted.
The new system may help the government to allay criticisms of over-secretive
Whitehall practices that could emerge from the Scott inquiry into arms for
Iraq and which are at the heart of the investigation into the Pergau dam aid
deal with Malaysia.
The prime minister said the overhaul would 'allow fewer government documents
to be classified, particularly at the higher levels'. He also claimed that
the definitions and recent review of security measures would permit
'substantial cost savings' in vetting procedures.
At present, the 'top secret' classification is defined as 'causing
exceptionally grave damage to the interests of the nation'. It is to be
replaced by a longer definition which says that such information, if leaked,
would 'lead directly to widespread loss of life' or 'threaten directly the
internal stability of the UK or friendly countries'.
But pressure groups and opposition MPs were sceptical about whether the
changes would lead to more disclosure. Campaigners against official secrecy
said the reform would merely give Whitehall departments more elaborate
reasons to withhold information when a new Code of Practice on Government is
introduced in the next few days.
The code is being hailed by ministers as a breakthrough in freedom of
information, giving the public the right to request information on any
Whitehall department's activities.
But Mr Maurice Frankel, director of the Campaign for Freedom of Information,
said the new classifications would give officials better reasons for keeping
information secret. He emphasised that a department's decision not to
release information could not be challenged in the courts.
Mr Michael Meacher, shadow civil service minister, said: 'Not a single
document will be released or be more directly available as a result of this
feeble review.'

FT  24 MAR 94 / Personal pension sales face tougher guidelines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tough guidelines designed to stop personal pensions salesmen evading their
responsibility to give proper advice to clients are to be published shortly.
The guidelines are part of a wider effort to restore public confidence in
the selling of personal pensions to people transferring out of occupational
schemes. Research published last year suggested many people transferring
were poorly advised.
A report published yesterday by the Securities and Investments Board, the
City's chief watchdog, will impose stricter rules on sales agents. The rules
should make it less likely that sales agents will say that they were simply
following a client's wishes or that their advice was overruled. These are
explanations sometimes offered by sales agents for cases where clients have
acted against what seemed to be their best financial interests.
The SIB set out to tighten regulations covering pensions transfers after a
pilot study published last December provoked widespread public concern that
a significant proportion of the more than 500,000 people who have
transferred into personal pensions since 1988 may have been poorly advised.
Having set new standards for future pensions sales, the SIB is working on
how to compensate investors who will be worse off as a result of poor
advice. It is to publish guidance on compensation by August.
The report yesterday proposes that customers should have a 'cooling off'
period of at least 14 days to decide whether to go ahead with a transfer. It
should be compulsory for firms to use a computerised system to check the
value of a lump sum which a client would take out from an occupational
scheme.
As a way of ensuring tighter control over what the sales agent or adviser
says to the customer, the report says that every transaction must be
accompanied by a 'reason why' letter, explaining the advice given to the
customer. The letter would go to the investor and would also have to be
filed by the sales agent.
The requirement for the letter, the new guidelines and the compulsory use of
computers to analyse the value of lump sums, will come into effect from July
1.
Among the longer-term moves recommended by the report is the requirement for
regulators to treat pension transfer business as a special category of
business. This would enable regulators to look at whether a firm was suited
to carrying out that specific activity and to discourage any that were
merely dabbling.

FT  24 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Lasmo
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is difficult to quibble with Lasmo's decision to pass its final dividend.
With development expenditure set to remain high over the next three years
and the oil price at rock bottom, the company is being squeezed. Exploration
spending has already been scaled back to Pounds 50m a year, probably not
enough to replace reserves now being drilled. Gearing could rise above 100
per cent - counting Lasmo's US preference shares as equity - before
Liverpool Bay and other development projects come on stream. In that context
the Pounds 20m cash cost of the dividend was a burden.
Gearing would be less of a worry if Lasmo's balance sheet understated the
true value of its assets, as is often the case with oil companies. But even
after yesterday's write-downs, the suspicion remains that more will be
required. Having replenished shareholders' funds with dollar prefs last
year, the company is comfortably above minimum net worth covenants imposed
by its bankers. Should oil prices dictate further write-downs, though,
Lasmo's management might feel more comfortable with an infusion of real
equity.
The snag is that shareholders would have little incentive to subscribe under
those circumstances. Despite all its good work last year reducing overheads
and disposing of high-cost production - yesterday's sale of its interest in
the Ninian field is a case in point - Lasmo requires a material recovery in
the oil price if it is to flourish. It is hard to see the shares
outperforming until that is in prospect.

FT  24 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Institutional investment
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's institutional investment figures for the final quarter of
1993 bear all the footprints of fund managers stampeding into the
fashionable assets of the day. There was strong net investment in overseas
securities and property as investors scrambled to fulfil the targets set by
their asset allocation committees. It is perhaps little surprise that many
overseas markets have proved groggy since and property shares have paused
for breath.
Institutional liquidity will be fuelled again this year by rising dividends,
the ending of many pension fund holidays and strong sales of single-premium
investment products by the life insurance sector. Theoretically, that should
help UK financial markets. With cash inflows remaining high and the rate of
gilts and equity issuance dropping sharply, markets should be squeezed
higher by the sheer weight of money. The inflow of fresh funds into
institutions may reach Pounds 55bn this year while the government's funding
requirement will drop from Pounds 50bn to Pounds 38bn. The flow of rights
issues has abated; flotations are only likely to absorb part of that
shortfall.
But that happy investment scenario tends to overlook the influences on the
existing owners of stocks and assets. Hedge funds have been pruning their
holdings and overseas investors have turned tail in the gilts market. UK
institutions may be flush with cash this year but the signs are they will
have to take up a lot more of the running.

FT  24 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Kingfisher
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Marks and Spencer's surging profits are living proof that Kingfisher's
everyday low pricing strategy works. Sadly, there is as yet little evidence
that it works at Kingfisher. Last year operating profits in the main UK
retailing businesses actually fell by 3 per cent, despite all the huffing
and puffing. B&amp;Q is a central plank of the EDLP idea, yet profits here will
probably be lower in 1996 than they were in 1990. Group earnings may rise by
no more than 10 per cent in 1994 and 1995, which goes a long way towards
explaining the heavy de-rating of the shares since the turn of the year.
Perhaps Kingfisher simply has the right strategy and the wrong businesses.
Electrical retailing offers a high return on capital in out-of-town
locations, but most store chains are still dogged by their expensive high
street shops. If they are eliminated, returns may fall. Superdrug has a weak
position against Boots, and may also be squeezed by the food superstores.
Woolworths is trying EDLP, but in many of Woolies' specialities, out-of-town
chains such as Toys 'R' Us are more effective players of the EDLP game. If
Woolworths did not exist, it would probably not be necessary to invent it.
Faced with a difficult hand, at least the company is doing most of the right
things. Mr Alan Smith, the new chief executive, is strengthening the
management team and installing better systems. There may well be a
revolution going on at Kingfisher. EDLP may work. But it will be quite a
while before shareholders find out whether it is going to benefit them.

FT  24 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Sinking in the trough
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Tighter money in the US has made financial markets there supremely sensitive
to any signs of rising inflation, and the obsession seems to be spreading.
Yesterday's UK inflation figures played into the hands of the Jeremiahs,
though the disappointment was largely superficial. There has been some
faintly worrying background noise in the housing market, on average earnings
and commodity prices, but producer price inflation is still depressed and
the 0.6 per cent monthly jump in February's retail prices index owed much to
the end of the January sales. Since the retail sales figure for that month
was weak, higher prices in the shops may not stick.
Yesterday's figures need not undermine expectations of a further fall in the
headline rate of inflation later this summer. But the conclusion on interest
rates is different. The authorities would suffer a serious loss of
credibility if they cut rates on the back of yesterday's figures. Next
month's data will be perilously close to the European and local elections.
Cutting rates then would invite the charge of political influence on
monetary policy.
The hope must be that the economy has enough momentum to shrug off next
month's tax rises. If so, the eventual judgment will be there was never any
need for another base rate cut anyway. But growth cannot continue
indefinitely without some pressure on prices. Barring a serious hiccup in
the recovery, the trough in rates may have been reached. Yesterday's
46-point fall in the equity market suggests this point is finally sinking
in.

Peter Mokaba, ex-Robben Island prisoner, fiery orator, former leader of the

Durr, who is proving to be an adroit diplomatic performer, had persuaded
Mokaba to speak at an embassy election seminar.

No great surprise that Jardine Matheson taipan Henry Keswick was a no-show
at the company's press conference yesterday on the subject of delisting its
shares in Hong Kong.
The notion of sweeping out of the stock exchange in a huff was very much his
own, but, like the Queen and the Pope, Keswick does not grant interviews.
Normally based in London's Lombard Street, Jardine's eminence grise was
indubitably present in the colony - Observer's man on the ground ran into
his imposing self in the street.
But he left the talking to Sir Charles Powell, Margaret Thatcher's eminently
plausible former adviser, who seems to have donned the mantle of the group's
chief international fire-fighter.
The whole thing must have seemed a doddle to Powell, who arrived hotfoot
from a couple of days in Malaysia with Mahathir Mohamad.
His usual brimming confidence was no doubt further bolstered by the fact
that Gammon, the construction company owned jointly by Jardine and Trafalgar
House, is now safely off the list of British firms proscribed from bidding
for Malaysian government contracts.

FT  24 MAR 94 / Observer: Piccolo Pekkulo
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
An Italian residing in Brussels is today savouring a magnum of Dom Perignon,
thanks in part to the FT.
It's his prize for winning a bet that he could succeed in having published
another in a series of multilingual hoaxes against newspapers, including
this one.
His score in the FT this week purported to stem from one Manko Pekkulo, of
Finland's Brussels embassy. The putative author explained that
'Finlandisation' - being under Moscow's thumb - was not so bad, but added
that it was probably inevitable that Finland would now be annexed by another
empire, the European Union.
The Finnish mission quickly disavowed the letter; the FT published its
disclaimer.
But 'Manko Pekkulo', using a variety of pseudonyms, claims to have long
plied the letters column of the Belgian daily, Le Soir, with spoof letters,
including a joke at Japanese Emperor Akihito's expense during his visit to
Brussels last September.

It seems Lord Tebbit's self-imposed silence in the run-up to June's European
elections will not be total.
His planned trip to the US notwithstanding, it seems the Tory party's
arch-Eurosceptic intends to break his silence at least once - on behalf of
one Professor Philip Treleaven, the prospective Conservative candidate for
London South West.
But then again, with John Major suddenly coming over all tough in the battle
about enlargement, the former Tory chairman's utterances may no longer spook
the leadership quite in the way they once did.

In the coming era of telephone banking, Royal Bank of Scotland's choice of
BT chairman Sir Iain Vallance as a vice-chairman has the right ring. With a
father who once headed the Post Office north of the border, Vallance's Scots
credentials also happen to be impeccable.
Colin Brown, BT's departing head of corporate affairs, was moved to recall
that Scots connection the other day apropos some advice he was given on
joining the Post Office, of which BT was then a part.
How fast could a graduate trainee rise to the next grade, he inquired
gingerly of a golfing pal in the business.
'Three years minimum,' came the reply, 'unless your father runs the Post
Office in Scotland - then it's five months.'

'He that filches from me my good name . . . makes me poor indeed.' Could
Othello be the next Japanese folk hero? About 4.5m Japanese, who are facing
a government edict to alter the way they write their names, could echo his
plaintive words.
The Justice Ministry wants to computerise its list of 45.4m officially
registered family names, all of which are written, as is usual for Japanese
signatures, in kanji, using Chinese characters. But 10 per cent of the names
take irregular kanji forms, and the ministry's software can't cope. The
oddballs must be 'corrected' - with or without their owners' consent.
Parents who carefully select the kanji for their offspring's name,
preferring a lucky number of brush strokes to dictionary correctness, are
not best pleased.
'I wonder if the ministry has the right to exercise such discretion to
change names,' linguistics professor Susumu Ohno ponders from his tower at
Gakushuin University meanwhile. And the ministry? Not surprisingly, in some
quarters its name is mud.

FT  24 MAR 94 / On the brink of a breakdown: The impasse on voting rights
that threatens to provoke a crisis over EU enlargement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Union loves to live dangerously. Brinkmanship runs in the
blood, but there comes a point when members of the club must decide whether
to pull back or precipitate a crisis.
This point is approaching rapidly in the dispute over power-sharing in an
expanded Union. Without an agreement in the next week or so, there is a
serious risk that Finland, Sweden, Austria and Norway will be unable to meet
the agreed date of January 1 1995 for EU entry.
A delay threatens to erode fragile public support for EU membership among
the four Nordic and Alpine applicants, where only the Finns show a
consistent majority in favour of entry. Postponement of enlargement would
reinforce the sense of disarray in the Union, rekindling doubts about more
ambitious projects such as a common foreign and security policy and a single
European currency.
There may be other unpredictable consequences. Britain and Spain's
insistence on maintaining their ability to block decisions in an enlarged
Union has attracted nationalist cheers at home. But it threatens to break
the informal truce among heads of government over the constitutional future
of the Union, a truce which barely held during the painful ratification of
the Maastricht treaty.
Until the latest imbroglio over voting rights, the consensus among the
Twelve was to hold fire on constitutional issues until 1996, the date set
for a review of Maastricht. But the power-sharing dispute has forced member
states to confront matters which many hoped to postpone: the relationship
between voting power and population in an expanded Union, and the
organisation of a Union of 20 or more member states, including the central
and east Europeans.
With Hungary's application to join the EU due next month, pressures for
faster integration of the east are growing. Germany, which takes over the
rotating EU presidency from Greece on July 1, is planning several
initiatives, including invitations to the former communist countries to send
permanent non-voting delegations to the European Parliament, and invitations
to heads of governments to attend European summits. 'We have to rethink our
whole policy toward eastern Europe,' said one senior Commission official.
It seems unlikely that the British and Spanish governments intended to open
up the debate about the future shape of the EU. Together they make an odd
couple: the pioneer of enlargement (Britain) hitched up with an EU partner
which has more reservations than most about its impact (Spain). The next few
days, starting with an EU foreign ministers meeting in Greece at the
weekend, will determine whether the London-Madrid alliance is a marriage of
convenience or principle.
Both Spain and Britain want to preserve voting rules in an expanded Union
which prevent two large countries and one small member state being outvoted
 -23 votes are at present needed to muster this blocking minority. Britain
is pressing for a legally binding protocol which would safeguard this
present position. Spain may settle for something less, but it remained firm
at Tuesday's meeting of EU foreign ministers.
Voting procedures do not affect matters of sovereignty such as foreign
policy or European monetary union, where a national veto by one member state
can be exercised; but they do cover decisions on 'second tier' issues such
as the environment, health and safety regulations, tobacco advertising, and
trade action. For instance, the UK collected enough votes to block the first
Commission proposals for reform of the Common Agricultural Policy in the
early 1990s; and last year won support from Germany and the Netherlands to
block trade reprisals against cheap aluminium imports from Russia.
For the Madrid government, the planned switch to a 27-vote threshold is
especially worrisome because it challenges the power of the 'olive oil
minority'. This grouping allows Spain to combine with Italy and Greece to
muster 23 votes to block decisions judged to infringe its vital interests,
mainly in the area of Mediterranean agriculture.
For the UK, the tale is more tangled. Along with Germany, Britain had ranked
as the Nordic applicants' best friend. Yet British support for 'widening'
Europe has always been based on the assumption that it would not come at the
price of further 'deepening' of Euro-institutions.
The British calculation is that enlargement can proceed without further
erosion of national sovereignty, and its conviction has strengthened in the
past two years as ministers have watched public ambivalence about Maastricht
grow on the continent, particularly in France and Germany. The belief that
the tide in Europe is running Britain's way is widely held in Westminster,
even though it has proved misplaced in the past and is not held in the
Foreign Office.
Brussels officials express astonishment that the UK has invested so much
capital on an issue which they describe as peripheral compared with the
greater political prize: enlargement of the Union to include wealthy,
free-trading Scandinavians who will very soon be net contributors to the EU
budget.
The suspicion is that Mr John Major, UK prime minister, is wrapping himself
in the Union Jack to prevent a civil war in his own party over Europe in the
run-up to the European Parliament elections in June, where polls suggest the
Tories will suffer heavy losses. The prime minister also looks boxed in by
his own Cabinet, where a mixture of Euro-sceptics and pretenders to the
premiership have turned an arcane voting system into a cause celebre.
When EU foreign ministers met on Tuesday, Britain and Spain were clearly
isolated. Ten countries declared there was no question of offering
legally-binding protection for the 23-vote blocking minority, a position
echoed by the European Parliament, which must give its assent to the
enlargement treaty by early May or postpone consideration until after the
June polls.
Here is the big risk. Without an early favourable vote in the Parliament,
there seems little hope of Finland, Sweden, Austria and Norway holding
referendums on the accession treaties in time for the target date for entry
into the Union. 'The whole momentum of enlargement would be lost,' said one
Scandinavian ambassador.
British officials say their best hope lies in persuading Germany to come up
with a compromise. The Bonn government has little appetite for making
population reflect voting power more accurately because it would mean a more
populous Germany acquiring more votes than France, thus jeopardising the
relationship with its closest ally. It insists that the threshold is raised
from 23 to 27 votes.
British officials are hoping, however, that Germany may agree to a deal
whereby certain areas - notably social policy - would be subject to the
23-vote blocking minority in return for UK acceptance of 27 votes on most
other areas. But such a solution still runs the risk of being turned down by
the Parliament.
What irks Britain and Spain's partners is that London and Madrid implicitly
accepted the principle of a 'mechanical' adjustment in voting weights at the
Lisbon summit in June 1992. The European Commission, as well as
federalist-minded countries such as Belgium and the Netherlands, argued in
favour of more far-reaching reforms to streamline decision-making in an
expanded European Union; but they were overruled by the UK and Germany which
insisted that enlargement should come first.
A Dutch diplomat, echoing widespread sentiment in Brussels, argues that the
UK's strategy is to 'roll back' Maastricht and push the European Union
further towards loose inter-governmental co-operation. 'The British are
taking a very consistent line,' agrees a German official.
The question is whether the rest of the Union has the stomach to provoke a
confrontation now, or cobble together a compromise in the hope that the deep
divisions over the future shape and pace of integration can be resolved in
1996.
Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, has no doubt about the best
outcome. 'It is better to have a crisis than to have a bad compromise which
later turns out to make things five or six times worse.'

FT  24 MAR 94 / Leading Article: Monetarily ad hoc
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Since the US Federal Reserve first raised short-term interest rates by a
quarter of a point early in February, analysts have struggled to make sense
of the shell-shocked behaviour of world bond markets. Yet the Fed's decision
on Monday to signal a further quarter-point increase, together with the
subsequent marginal reduction in the Bundesbank's repurchase rate, are
arguably no easier to rationalise than the related market movements. In both
the US and Germany ad hoc gradualism appears to have taken the place of a
more orthodox framework for policy.
The declared intention of the Fed's Mr Alan Greenspan has been to return
monetary policy to a neutral stance after the period in which low short-term
interest rates were needed to help recapitalise the banking system. More
than three years into an increasingly robust recovery, short-term rates of 3
1/2 per cent look more like laxity than neutrality.
Nor is it clear why small incremental increases are the appropriate way to
contain latent inflationary pressure in an economy where the underlying rate
of growth in demand may be running at 3-4 per cent. If Mr Greenspan believes
that the pressure is real, it would make more sense - and help stabilise the
bond markets - to get the full adjustment out of the way.
Similar questions could be raised about the Bundesbank's salami-slicing
tactics. The lags in monetary policy are long: it can take up to two years
for a given change in short-term rates to have its full impact on real
output and inflation. It follows that monetary policy cannot sensibly be
fine-tuned from week to week in response to subtle and often contradictory
clues as to the state of the domestic economy. As with the Fed, the absolute
level of interest rates appears to be behind events, although the bias in
this case is on the side of tightness.
The Bundesbank could, in mitigation, plead that a strong element of
discretion is essential when the money supply figures are overshooting
wildly in an economy where recovery is perceptible, but only just. Even so,
small incremental rate reductions have failed to prevent the sell-off in the
bond markets that has always worried the Bundesbank in view of the funding
strains from unification. Perhaps gradualist cuts have the merit of
reconciling the wider public to the short-run costs of meeting a
historically demanding inflation target of less than 2 per cent. Yet the
fact remains that the Bundesbank is in a box; and it is far from clear that
the alternative policy to gradual cuts would be any more credible.
Comparing the activity of the monetary authorities with the behaviour of US
Treasury bonds suggests that the finesse is all on the side of the markets.
US bond yields started to rise last October. That looks a more timely -
though admittedly politically unrestrained - pre-emptive strike than the
Fed's. For the Bundesbank, the dilemma is more complicated. But a policy of
frequent, modest cuts remains an unsatisfactory answer.

FT  24 MAR 94 / Let's be the 51st state
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS and MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This memo was discovered wrapped around a Motorola mobile telephone, on the
pavement outside a Japanese government ministry.
To: The Cabinet Office. From: Interministerial Sub-committee on Economic
Relations. Title: Adhesion to the US.
Dear Sirs,
You asked for advice on Japan's strategy in the trade dispute with the US.
We present a modest proposal for inclusion in the package of measures to
open Japan to imports, due to be unveiled by the end of the month. The
government should present an application for Japan to be accepted as a state
of the United States of America.
Constitutional experts tell us that Japan might, in some important areas,
expect less intervention than now from Washington in the exercise of its
sovereign rights if it became a US state.
We make this suggestion both in the spirit of responding to US criticisms of
the Japanese bureaucracy's alleged lack of imagination, and on national (or
state) interest grounds. US membership could bring the following benefits.
Economic: Japan's current account surplus would vanish and reappear where
Washington appears to want it, as a US surplus.
There would be little practical difference to Japanese economic policy. The
Tokyo government is already used to importing the US example, on monetary
policy in the late 1980s and on fiscal matters, if incompletely this year.
Currency union between the yen and the dollar would be the opportunity we
need for correcting the Japanese currency's over-valuation and the dollar's
under-valuation.
The fact that Congress's constitutional right to fix the value of money
would mean it had the power to set the dollar-yen alignment parity need not
be a problem. Japan's 124m people would carry a certain political weight in
the new US with its enlarged population of 374m. In theory, that should
allow the new state of Japan to lay claim to around a third of the seats in
the House of Representatives.
We recommend Y360 to the dollar, the rate prevailing before the 1971
abandonment of the gold link, as the starting point for negotiations on the
alignment parity.
Japanese purchasers of US government bonds would be able to pick up more,
free of exchange rate risk, while US institutions, strong buyers of Tokyo
stocks recently, could sweep the market. Japanese banks, meanwhile, would be
happy to hand monetary policy to Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal
Reserve, given his experience in defending US banks in trouble.
Trade: The guarantee of free trade between US states, as laid down in the US
constitution, would remove the basis for dispute with Washington. No more
arguing over the definition of a foreign made semiconductor chip, nor
haggling over mobile telephone technology. No more anti-dumping suits.
This would unleash a flow of cheap imports, from food to cosmetics, to the
new state of Japan, supporting the existing policies of new governor
Morihiro Hosokawa promoting deregulation and lower consumer prices.
The consequences would be spread through the larger US economy to both
sides' benefit. Japan would get an economic boost and the US a dose of
deflation. The increased size of the US single market would help both sides
get richer and provide a counterbalance to the European Union, another power
bloc taking on new members.
Our constitutional advisers, at the same time, note that US states do have a
certain latitude to impose state tariff barriers to trade, on health and
safety grounds. This opens the appealing prospect of reimposing the ban on
non-Japanese rice, in the same spirit as the Californian ban on many kinds
of imported citrus fruit.
We believe, however, that there should be no inter-state trade barriers for
the car industry. It would be a positive benefit for the new Japanese state
to switch from driving on the left, to driving to the right, as in the rest
of the US.
This would be welcome to the car industries of our new state neighbours, but
pose no practical problem for Japanese car producers, long accustomed to
adjusting models to local markets. Nor should this pose a problem for
Japanese drivers, since the residents of Okinawa island switched from right
to left in the mid-1960s without mishap.
Foreign policy: Our government has often been criticised for its lack of
one. Like it or not, we think this is close to the truth. But as a US state,
it would be unconstitutional to run our own foreign policy, so we could all
sigh with relief. We could even disband the military. That would please
Prime Minister Hosokawa since it would keep the Socialists on his side in
the coalition.
Power structure: There need be no change of Japanese government. Nor need
Japan reverse its recent electoral reforms, since states are entitled to
establish their own systems for state elections. Mr Hosokawa's eight years
as governor of Kumamoto Prefecture should equip him well to be a state
governor. Who knows, he might even succeed former governor Bill Clinton, if
the Japanese lobby takes root in Washington.
The emperor: As far as we know, no US state has one, though the territory of
Hawaii used to have a king until 1898. However, we believe that the freedom
of religion clause in the first amendment assures Japan's right to keep its
emperor, on the grounds that his father was - for some of his life - a god.

FT  24 MAR 94 / Leading Article: Russian gamble
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Michel Camdessus, director-general of the International Monetary Fund, has
decided to gamble on Victor Chernomyrdin, Russia's prime minister. If the
gamble fails, the IMF will have wasted Dollars 1.5bn, Mr Camdessus will look
foolish and the IMF's reputation will have been damaged. If the gamble is
successful, however, Russian reform just might become irreversible. In
making the decision, Mr Camdessus overruled senior members of his staff. He
was right to do so. Whether the west is right to risk the reputation of the
IMF in this way is another matter.
A country that is promising to keep inflation to 7 per cent a month is
hardly the obvious target for IMF assistance. Nor is one with a planned
budget deficit of about 10 per cent of gross domestic product. But there was
little alternative to jumping in at this stage, other than watching the
government drown. The IMF had to start by rewarding intentions, partly
because assistance could make them more realistic.
If the government does show the determination and capacity to carry out what
it has promised, further support should be forthcoming. It will be needed,
since the sum now on offer cannot make much difference on its own. A further
Dollars 4bn of IMF money is on the table, while the Russian government hopes
for a Dollars 600m rehabilitation deal from the World Bank and, more
important, a formal rescheduling of its Dollars 80bn debts to western
creditors. Even these sums may not be enough to make reform feasible. The
old joke made by communist workers was that they pretend to pay us and we
pretend to work. Now it might be that the west pre-tends to help us and we
pretend to reform.
Are they pretending? With Boris Yeltsin apparently hors de combat,
everything depends on Mr Chernomyrdin, a former apparatchik allegedly
converted to the cause of reform. He should at least be able to do what is
now required to obtain the Dollars 1.5bn. But what will happen thereafter?
Will the government stick to the budget? Will it pursue the equally
important structural economic reforms? Mr Chernomyrdin's contacts and status
in the old Russian elite presumably give him a better chance of following
through than Mr Yegor Gaidar enjoyed. But the prime minister's determination
is more suspect, while the obstacles remain mountainous.
The strategy to which the west seems committed - assistance first, followed
by measurable performance and then, perhaps, more assistance - is the only
feasible one. It is unfortunate, however, that the IMF has been put in
charge of the western effort, since the credibility of the institution has
been put at stake. It would have been better to empower a plenipotentiary
representative of the Group of Seven leading industrial countries instead.
But the die is now cast. The Russians must show the gamble was worth taking;
the west must respond positively to serious effort at reform.

FT  24 MAR 94 / Leading Article: Shipbuilding
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The progress of international negotiations intended to eliminate
shipbuilding subsidies has revealed a worrying shift in US thinking. After
initiating the present round of talks five years ago, with the aim of
removing subsidies, the US now seems bent on increasing the support it gives
its own shipbuilding industry.
Last week US negotiators at the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and
Development took a tough new line by insisting on the freedom to require
that ships financed by its export credit schemes be built in US yards. Other
delegations saw this as an attempt to establish an unacceptable principle,
contrary to the very purpose of the negotiations.
It is particularly unfortunate that this apparent setback has occurred when
Japan and South Korea, long regarded as the least flexible in this matter,
have finally shown themselves willing to offer concessions. They have, in
fact, declared themselves ready to accept an anti-dumping code for ships, to
prevent 'injurious pricing.'
It is ironic, too, that the US is not a large builder of merchant shipping,
though the decline in naval orders in the wake of the ending of the cold war
may be a partial explanation of its stance.
Meanwhile, it emerged yesterday that the US administration will back the
Gibbons Bill, which would penalise ships docking at US ports if they came
from countries with 'unfair' shipyard subsidies. At the least the new stance
seems internally inconsistent, with the US intending to act against the
subsidies of others, while resorting to subsidised export promotion itself.
One unwelcome outcome of the new US approach could be to split opinion
within the European Union. Governments in southern Europe, in particular,
are under strong pressure to relax subsidy rules. The EU has made good
progress with its subsidy reduction regime in recent years. But this could
now be reversed.
Sweden's ambassador to the OECD, Mr Staffan Sohlman, chairman of the
shipbuilding talks, will attempt to produce a document which he hopes will
be acceptable to all participants in the talks. The aim is to reach a final
agreement by May.
Reaching such an accord is important. Failure would not only hurt those
shipyards which have improved their efficiency but would rebound on the
shipping sector. Unbridled, subsidised production of new ships adds to the
problems of liner conferences already faced with overcapacity on many
routes.
There is a danger that pressures for shipbuilding subsidies will not just be
maintained, but strengthened. Despite the decline of shipbuilding activity
in many western countries, it is important that agreement on subsidies is
reached. A failure here would provide encouragement to the pro-subsidy lobby
in other important areas, such as steel and aircraft manufacture.

FT  24 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Transport problem must be tackled
head on
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr S J ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The policy guidance on transport published last week gives the
impression that the government is planning the environment by remote control
('Gummer aims to reduce car use', March 16). As one of the key points of
this new policy is to promote alternatives to the private car, it is
perplexing to try and understand how this might be achieved through a
planning and development strategy. Why not tackle the issue head on?
It is even more perplexing when seen against the government's indecision
over CrossRail - surely a perfect example of an alternative to the private
car in an already congested London?
It has been hinted that the downfall of CrossRail may be due in no small
part to Michael Portillo, the chief secretary to the Treasury, who has been
a long-standing objector to the scheme.
A sustainable environment requires the government to have the inclination
and the ability to provide real alternatives for the public. As it is, the
government's lack of cohesive policy between its various departments on this
issue can only cause confusion, resulting in no strategy whatsoever.
This vacuum creates the worst possible context for Mr Portillo and transport
secretary, John MacGregor, in their efforts to attract private sector
investment in the transport sector.

FT  24 MAR 94 / Economic Viewpoint: Nimbyism - the growing cost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One might suppose that monetarism had been studied to the point where it was
difficult to add anything new. Yet at the History of Economics Society
Conference in London yesterday, something of a fresh angle emerged.
This may just have been in the eye of the beholder; but the fresh approach
did seem to me to throw light on a variety of matters, including quite
homely questions such as the relation of the supply of building land to
inflation and economic recovery.
The place to start is the emerging distinction between the modern monetarism
used in forecasts and monetary targets and the historical Quantity Theory of
Money as developed by John Locke, David Hume, the early Milton Friedman and
others.
In what follows I am almost certainly taking the distinction further than
the speakers intended, but it is still worth drawing out implications.
The Quantity Theory of Money relates inflation to the amount of money in
circulation in a loose and long-term way. The original Quantity Theorists
allowed plenty of room for time lags, changes in velocity and transitory
effects on output, and were not dogmatic on how quickly or by how much a
given percentage increase in money would raise prices. They also allowed for
institutional changes and shocks from outside the monetary system. All that
the Quantity Theory needs is the general proposition that money matters and
that monetary changes can cause price changes and not just reflect them. The
policy implications will depend on place and time.
Moreover, until the breakdown of Bretton Woods in the early 1970s no country
attempted to target the money supply directly. The latter was regulated
automatically by the gold standard and by the structure of bank deposits and
credits erected on the gold base. To the extent that monetary authorities,
like the US Fed, attempted an independent national policy, it was geared to
interest rates.
Modern monetarism, by contrast, insists on a stable demand for money related
to a few variables such as prices, real incomes and interest rates. Rightly
or wrongly, it has shared in the discredit into which would-be scientific
economics has fallen. In any case, its evaluation is reserved for
econometric experts.
The immediate point of drawing the distinction is that something like the
very tight British system for limiting land for building development would
not be regarded as relevant to inflation by many modern monetarists. But
there would be a place for it in a broader Quantity Theory.
This theory is normally stated in terms of the identity MV equals PT. The
quantity of money, times its velocity of circulation, equals the average
price per transaction, times the total number of transactions. Some
adjustments are required to apply the identity to national income
statistics, but it will do for exposition.
Too much of the modern discussion has centred on the definition of M or
stability of V. A shrewd central banker like Alan Greenspan, US Fed
chairman, will allow for changes in the financial system and try to
stabilise the total flow of money spending, MV, without necessarily worrying
too much about the components.
More interesting is the breakdown of PT, the price level times the level of
economic activity. The pioneering economists of the 18th and 19th centuries
would have known well enough that an interruption to production and trade,
such as the Napoleonic wars or a bad harvest, would reduce T and thus raise
the price level.
These reflections came to my mind in relation to the complaint in Tuesday's
Financial Times by Mr David Wilson, chairman of the house builders Wilson
Bowden, that land prices for high quality housing sites had risen by an
average of 25 per cent in the past 12 months and by up to 50 per cent in the
south-east.
Why has this happened so alarmingly early in the recovery? An unreflective
reaction might be that monetary policy is too loose and stoking up demand. A
more reflective Quantity Theorist would, however, wonder whether something
had happened on the side of T to restrict supply and therefore stoke up
inflation from the other end.
The quick answer is that something has indeed happened. This was a
tightening of planning restrictions in the early 1990s, which has reduced
the potential supply of building land. Kevin Cammack, of Smith New Court,
predicted nearly two years ago that the Town and Country Planning Act of
1990 and another act of 1991 would make it harder to secure planning
permission for building sites and make appeals almost impossible.
Builders are now convinced that local authority development plans are at the
mercy of residents who say 'Not in my backyard' (Nimby) and are supported by
the government. This was not noticed before, because of the recession.
Now that activity is rising, however, it is coming up against much tighter
zoning restrictions. When rising demand collides with an inelastic supply,
it does not take a genius to see that the result must be higher prices.
To spell out the causation: recovering demand leads to rising house prices,
which in turn boosts the price of land. But as land with planning permission
is a speculative asset, owners and investors do not wait for the chain of
events but start marking up prices when recovery is in the air. The effect
of any given rise in the demand for homes on both house prices and land
values will depend on how responsive the supply of land is to building
demand.
A purist might object that house prices are only one element in the general
price level. But they are an important one. And they usually move in the
same direction as factory and office rents. An attempt to force other prices
down to offset rising property values could be very painful. A comparison
might be with what would have happened if governments had attempted to force
other prices down to offset the oil price explosions of 1973 and 1979.
Moreover high and rising house prices are believed to have a multiplier
effect on inflation through the perception of increased wealth they bring to
their owners.
The shadow now on economic recovery is still no larger than a man's hand.
But that is the time to watch it. Good house prices indices are difficult to
find. The Department of the Environment and the Inland Revenue Valuation
Office indices look very different. But the general trend is clear enough.
Urban land prices were rising even in the recession of the early 1980s and
quintupled between 1983 and 1989. Since then they have fallen by about a
half, but are now on the rise again. A small recovery shown in the Valuation
Office index between the spring and autumn of 1993 is widely regarded in the
construction industry as too low.
At present prices, land accounts for some 20 to 30 per cent of the price of
a new house and up to 50 per cent in the most favoured parts of the
south-east. Consumer expenditure related to housing is about 10 per cent of
the total shown in the National Income Blue Book. If house prices were to
double over a few years, the effect on people's perception of inflation
would be severe, even though the retail prices index gives too much weight
to interest rates and not nearly enough to house prices.
If the government sticks to its anti-inflation objectives, the effect will
be felt on economic activity instead. Alas, if the Bank of England puts on
the brakes because of inflationary signals from the property market, this
will inhibit growth and recovery much earlier on than if there had been a
plentiful supply of land.
Indeed, the effect on inflation and on official interest rate policies are
in the last resort symptoms. The underlying process is that obstacles are
being put in the way of business development and of places for workers to
live. There is almost no link between the 'green' policies of the Department
of the Environment and the growth and price stability objectives of the
Treasury and (one hopes) the Department of Trade and Industry. Even if folly
cannot be stopped, it should at least be exposed.

FT  24 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Alternative view of pensions
'fantasy'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ERIC LAMBERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Barry Riley's view ('Break-up threat to pension fund fantasy league',
March 16) that UK pension funds are moving away from a 'fantasy league' is
his interpretation of surveys like ours. Others may interpret differently.
Balanced managers have done the UK pensions industry, the sponsoring
companies and members a great service compared with those overseas. While a
number may 'tweak consensus strategy', this is hardly surprising when this
consensus is their target. Many others seeking higher targets are likely to
employ managers who display distinct preferences and styles - they cannot
slavishly follow the consensus when they are engaged in compiling it. Twenty
years of consensus results have produced annualised returns of 15.3 per cent
a year when earnings growth has been 10.1 per cent.
Universes reflect the reality of pension funds, maturity et al. Indeed the
WM All Funds Universe is currently split into, broadly, three equal parts;
funds with positive net contribution flow ignoring investment income,
positive cash flow only when including investment income, and negative cash
flow despite investment income. The WM 50 Universe of very large funds
represents an even more mature peer group. If the industry profile has
changed over time, the aggregate of the new environment is just as
meaningful as it was of the old.

FT  24 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Better to look at detailed evidence
on Citizen's Charter progress
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From WILLIAM WALDEGRAVE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I was surprised to see the letter from Elizabeth Symons (March 21)
about the government's public sector reform policy. She seems to forget that
the whole Competing for Quality programme, of which contracting out and
market testing are elements, is about three clear aims: getting government
to concentrate on the essentials; introducing more competition and choice
into the provision of services; and raising standards and cutting costs.
The Citizen's Charter second report published last week shows that we have
scored important gains in all of these areas. The report shows we have made
savings through market testing and contracting out of Pounds 135m, and there
is a mass of information to show how individual departments contributed to
this total. If Ms Symons is puzzled by what we mean by savings, it is really
quite simple: it is the difference between what we were paying for a whole
range of government activity before market testing and contracting out, and
what we are paying now. If Ms Symons can think of a better way to do the
arithmetic, I should love to know.
There is a suggestion that we do not know the costs of the policy. One look
at the charter second report will show that we have set out the costs, again
in detail, breaking them down by department and also by consultancy and
set-up costs and by central market testing support costs. This clearly shows
an overall annual cost of Pounds 20m. Indeed, on the wider issue of
consultancy work in government, we had already decided to conduct our own
review long before Ms Symons made this an issue, and Sir Peter Levene is
running a multi-departmental efficiency scrutiny of this whole topic. This
is hardly the approach of a government trying to conceal the information.
I acknowledged that the glass is filling but is not topped up yet. Even now,
however, the savings we have made have repaid the cost of running the
programme more than five-fold, and we will make these savings now every
year, while the start-up costs of the policy are mostly behind us. This
looks like a convincing balance sheet to me, and certainly represents value
for money.
If Ms Symons doesn't want to take my word for it, I suggest that she asks
departments whether they think the policy is giving them benefits. Rather
than trying to score points from answers given by departments before the
charter report published the information, it would be better to look at the
detailed evidence that we have now released, which shows that the policy is
well on course.

FT  24 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Global warming line far too
simplistic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ANDREW WARREN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The argument that 'if saving energy made any sense everyone would
already be doing so to the optimum level' had, I fondly imagined, been
discredited some 20 years ago. So it was a little tiresome to see this
simplistic line pedalled by Messrs Roger Bate and Julian Morris in their
pamphlet, Global warming: apocalypse or hot air?. It was rather more
worrying that Bronwen Maddox's review of it, 'Greenhouse faces stoning'
(March 18), should apparently accept much of this at face value.
For the record, here are some of the obstacles which have long been
acknowledged to distort the marketplace for energy efficiency investments:
lack of information; lack of finance; lack of knowhow and technical skills;
separation of responsibilities for energy supply expenditure and
conservation actions; landlord/tenant disincentives; energy tariffs which
encourage greater energy usage; and lack of confidence in novel technology.
This is the list of barriers which appears in the House of Commons energy
committee's report, 'Energy policy implications of the greenhouse effect',
published in 1989. It might have been helpful if at any rate some of these
had been addressed in the pamphlet (or raised in the article) before such a
sweepingly uninformed generalisation was made.

'SPECIAL' NO MORE Anglo-American relations: rhetoric and reality
By John Dickie
Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson 299 pages, Pounds 25
John Dickie was, until his retirement from the Daily Mail, the dean of
British diplomatic correspondents. An unmistakeable figure, he always wore a
fresh carnation in his button hole. Perhaps the Mail did not publish as much
of his work as it should have done, but the Foreign Office always read him.
He had a knack of hitting (more or less) the right targets on the right day.
So it remains, now that he has turned more to books than journalism.
'Special' No More, his survey of Anglo-American relations from roughly 1939
to the present day, could scarcely be better timed. Dickie thinks that it is
the end of the affair. Yet such have been the ups and downs in the
relationship over the decades that it may be too early to be sure.
Where Dickie scores is in throwing in the anecdotal evidence with the
researched. He notes in passing that the 'iron curtain' was first used in
print by Ethel Snowden, the wife of the Labour politician, on arriving in
Petrograd in 1920. It is the same with the 'special relationship'. Few
people are certain how it came into the language. Churchill used the term in
a memorandum in 1944, but it was only in his famous speech in Fulton,
Missouri, two years later that it became prominent.
Even then, it is worth being clear what Churchill said. He spoke not of a
special Anglo-American relationship, but one between 'the British
Commonwealth and Empire and the US'. And there, with hindsight, were the
seeds of future troubles.
The special relationship was fostered during the second world war because of
the joint desire to defeat Hitler and Japan. It may not have come about
quite so soon without the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour. The British were
in many ways an attractive ally. They were more advanced than the Americans
in research on atomic weapons; they had an excellent intelligence service;
and, as Bismarck had remarked long before, 'the most important fact of the
modern world is that Britain and America speak the same language'.
Yet it should have been apparent from the start that the relationship was
unequal and that, after the war, some interests would diverge. The US, then
as now, was as interested in the Pacific as in Europe. It was unlikely,
given its history, to come to the support of the British Empire, and the
Americans had their own ideas on the Middle East.
For a while the personal relationship between Churchill and President
Roosevelt flourished. Roosevelt's adviser, Harry Hopkins, even attended
British cabinet meetings. But, as Dickie notes, by 1943 Churchill was
beginning to feel a bit cut off from the mainstream of US policy-making. The
Americans were not planning quite the same post-war world as the British.
Again partially with hindsight, the British attitude to the American cousins
seems to have been remarkably patronising. As the rhyme puts it: 'In
Washington Lord Halifax once whispered to Lord Keynes, They have all the
money bags, but we have all the brains.'
Yet in foreign policy terms, or indeed in any other, that was never wholly
true. To be sure, there were - and remain - great post-war examples of
Anglo-American co-operation: the Berlin airlift for a start. Using some new
information, Dickie tells how the two countries combined to overthrow Dr
Mossadeq as prime minister of Iran. The British called it Operation Boot
because the objective was to boot him out. The Americans refined it to
Operation Ajax, but it still worked.
Sometimes, personal relations were crucial. Sir Anthony Eden never liked the
American Secretary of State, John Foster Dulles: this was one of the
contributory factors to the Suez crisis in 1956. On the other hand, Harold
Macmillan as the new prime minister repaired the Anglo-American relationship
in double quick time, and became very close to President Kennedy.
Thus the ups and downs continued, and there were policy divergences as well.
Successive British governments refused directly to help the Americans in
Vietnam. Lord Home was reviled in Washington for allowing the sale of
Leyland buses to Cuba and even Lady Thatcher fell out with Ronald Reagan
over the American invasion of Grenada - led incidentally by Major-General
Norman Schwarzkopf, who subequently made his name in the Gulf war.
The close co-operation between Britain and the US in that latter campaign
came about partly by chance. Thatcher happened to be in Aspen, Colorado,
with President Bush when the news arrived of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
There was a problem in the special relationship, however, that was growing
bigger with time and should have been realised in London. British policy was
more interested in Nato, where it could claim to be a bridge between Europe
and the US, than in the development of the European Union. The Americans
always knew this, but were usually too polite to say so in public. When Dean
Acheson had a shot at it in his 'lost an empire, not yet found a role'
speech, the British jumped on him, from Harold Macmillan downwards. Yet as
the cold war ended, and the European Union continued to expand, there was no
need for a bridge. What the Americans want is a Britain firmly in Europe.
Dickie writes that John Major became prime minister to deal with all that:
'His first decision of cardinal importance was to commit himself to the EC
in a way that Thatcher had refused to contemplate.' Given the events of the
past few days, that looks like an uncharacteristically bad judgment from
such a journalist. Dickie is a better reporter than he is leader-writer.
Most of his book is a delight. Academics will be infuriated that, like many
good journalists, he declines to give sources, but they look pretty
first-hand to me.

Richard Harris's comedy of manners, Outside Edge, with its weirdly assorted
couples coming together via the cricket pavilion, was a huge success on
stage, where Maureen Lipman played Maggie. Will it work as well now that
Harris has expanded it to a television series? We shall find out at 8.30
when ITV screens the first episode.
Cutting Edge Special investigates accidents at work and asks why inspectors
from the Health And Safety Executive refuse to prosecute individuals for
manslaughter (9.00 C4).
There have been good television drama series about the criminal underworld
in the US, Italy and Britain, so why not Russia? Brian Cox stars as the big
wheel in the St Petersburg Police, Grushko, whose name is the title of this
three-part mini series beginning on BBC1 (9.30).
Assassination and all kinds of violence in South Africa are routinely
attributed by white television producers to the heritage of apartheid. How,
then, do they explain assassination and violence in other African countries?
They don't. Beloved Country has another go at South Africa (9.30 BBC2).

OSCARS '94
SISTER ACT 2 (PG) Bill Duke
BEETHOVEN'S 2nd (U) Rod Daniel
DAENS (15) Stijn Coninx
A lightbulb thought occurred to me on Tuesday morning, as I consumed two
pieces of toast and a cup of tea in the company of Steven Spielberg, Tom
Hanks and Holly Hunter. Europe first watches the Oscars over breakfast and
surely sees this spree in truer light than any other population on the
planet. It is not about art or entertainment or even industry. It is about
family: with implications for western civilisation that we shall come to
shortly.
The world's most high-visibility exercise in self-congratulation has all the
innocence, though lit to blinding wattage, of a family gathered round the
morning cornflakes tearing open Junior's school report, Daddy's letter of
promotion and Mummy's pregnancy-test result. And this family - the
Hollywoods At Home - has another common family trait: keep-out exclusiveness
trying to turn itself into come-in warmth.
I think I twigged to this during Master Spielberg's acceptance speech.
Holding high his first ever statuette, the bearded wonderperson said
something about 'the six million people who can't be watching this tonight.'
For one nanosecond, it was as if Tinseltown really thought that the world -
not just all its countries, but all its lost generations - might be curable
by this annual riot of messianic togetherness: in which each year, around
Resurrection-time on the Christian calendar, a whole lot of industry
parents, children, uncles, aunts and cousins troop along, each bearing his
or her emotive constituency of thanks and good causes. Can you leave your
handkerchief untouched at so much good will?
Master Hanks, winning for Philadelphia and possibly auditioning for
Philadelphia 2, spoke up tearfully for Aids victims. Master Spielberg said
it for the absent friends of Jewish history. Auntie Holly (Hunter)
loquaciously represented the world's mutes, winning Best Actress for her
wordless role in The Piano. And Grandpa Paul Newman was presented with a
lifetime good causes award, gaining a special statuette for giving away
Dollars 80 million dollars' revenue from salad dressing.
Each member of the Hollywood clan had prepared his or her party-piece for
the underprivileged, as the atmosphere got more Dickensian by the minute. In
this orgy of PC and goodwill, there were only two persons slightly letting
the side down. One was hostess Whoopi Goldberg, who aimed a mocking quip at
her own multiple-threat ethnicity (black, Jewish . . . ) plus humanitarian
record (see Sister Act 2 below). The other was Uncle Tommy Lee Jones, who in
protesting that he was not really bald might have been seen as reinforcing
prejudice against the trichologically challenged.
Never mind: the evening's mixture of good causes and family feeling was
clinched by Miss Anna Paquin (aged 11), winning Best Supporting Actress for
The Piano. I confess I stopped right in mid-toast-chew for this one. The
diminutive thespian behaved just like your own little Laura/Megan/Tracy
going up to get her acting prize on Founder's Day. She advanced to the
platform, opened her mouth and no words came out. She stood there making
gasping motions like a distressed guppy; though on a second viewing it
started to look a little rehearsed. Perhaps she had been deputed to deliver
the 'mute' speech that Auntie Holly, who as Best Actress had to say
something and say it good, could not get away with.
It is sometimes said that the Oscars are decrepit, demode, de-everything
else you can think of. But I suspect that they are on the up and up: that
given time they will take over the western world's Ideal Family franchise,
now that our own dear dynasty has been shot down by the tabloids and its own
self-destruct instincts.
With Hollywood fast becoming the only dependable royalty, Oscar night itself
is becoming everything the Queen's Christmas speech used to be or to try to
be. It gives us a glimpse of the world as a giant mutual-help family. Woe
betide, if it has not already betid, anyone who brings cynicism to the
gathering. And lest you think I am fully armed with irony, let me say that
this viewer too shed a tear during Hanks's speech. There are times when the
line between real goodness and showbiz goodness becomes terrifyingly blurred
and we all get sucked in.
The game of Hollywood Happy Families, incorporating Hollywood One-Worldism,
does not stop at Oscar night. Sequelitis is a variation on the same
phenomenon. Look, if you can bear to, at Sister Act 2 and Beethoven's 2nd.
In the first Miss Goldberg is back in nun's habit, pouring good deeds over a
closure-threatened San Francisco high school. Can she teach the brats to
warble rock spirituals and win the all-state singing competition? That way
the school will stay open, causing Mother Superior Maggie Smith to weep into
her wimple and wicked school administrator James Coburn to gnash Dollars
5000 worth of Beverly Hills bridgework.
The film (awful) is upstaged by the publicity hand-out, even in the area of
good deeds. Miss Goldberg in her biog is cited for her 'tireless
humanitarian efforts on behalf of children, the homeless, human rights,
substance abuse and the battle against Aids.' Goodness. And on top of that
she has twice been required to act out, in the Sister Act films, a very
parable of Oscar night itself. For Las Vegas showgirl undergoing short-lease
metamorphosis as convent sister, read the population of Tinseltown turning
each Easter into a pan-global spiritual support system.
That sequels themselves are manifestations of a deep-rooted family instinct
 -they used, you recall, to be called 'Son Of Such-and-Such' - is basic
psycho-cultural diagnosis. What is more reassuring to Movieland's patriarchs
and matriarchs than the patter of tiny spin-offs around the house?
Beethoven's 2nd gives us not just an addition to this movie family but a
two-family storyline within itself. One is human: Charles Grodin and his
two-up-two-down nuclear foursome living in springcleaned suburbia. The other
is canine: Beethoven the St Bernard and his new love and their litter of
ooh-aah pups.
It is, be warned, frightful stuff. The press show audience was notably
silent, some parts of it being in deep shock, others in deep sleep. This is
a 'comedy' with no laughs and ladlefuls of sentimentality. But in Familyland
you must take the syrupy-smooth with the exhilaratingly rough. When
togetherness does not come out fighting it tends just to sit there, wearing
a gooey smile in the sun and getting stickier and stickier.
We all deserve one non-Hollywood experience this week, but we wish it had
not been Daens. As Belgian films about the late-19th century Flemish trade
union movement go, this one portentously dawdles. One 'Up the workers'
set-piece follows another, with the street fights scored for inspirational
music (out of Hoffa by FIST) being marginally preferable to the
love-across-the-barricades romance between Marxist boy and Christian
Democrat girl (out of Elvira Madigan by The Ballad Of Joe Hill). Stijn
Coninx directs. Jan Declair steals a few scenes as the eponymous
agitator-priest, resembling Gene Wilder ventriloquised by Ian Paisley.

FT  24 MAR 94 / Arts: Odd Soviet bedfellows - Music
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Russians keep coming, from all musical directions. Since the Soviet
Union was wound up, not only have ex-Soviet performers flooded the Western
market, but ex-Soviet composers too. There is an eager Western conviction
that their most original music must have been suppressed under Communism.
Hence the sedulously democratic attention given nowadays alike to the
visionary Sofia Gubaidulina, to knotty Edison Denisov, the maverick Alfred
Schnittke and the pious minimalist Arvo Part - and to anything by Prokofiev
or Shostakovich that went down badly with the old regime.
On Tuesday at the Barbican, the ex-Soviet Alexander Lazarev took the BBC
Symphony through an excellent programme of just such oddly-matched
bedfellows. First we heard Wingless, a recent work by Giya Kancheli, a
59-year-old Georgian who like the Estonian Part remembers ancient chant, but
subsumes it into an unhurried meditative flow, barely varied, more like
recent Gorecki or John Tavener. In Wingless, chorale-fragments alternate
steadily with fluttery motifs like shepherd's pipes or birdcalls. It went on
for some 25 minutes; the mind wandered, drowsily and pleasantly.
Then Dmitri Alexeev came on to deliver Nikolai Medtner's Piano Concerto no.
1 (1918) with all the tingling energy needed to keep its 19th-century
virtuoso writing airborne, the intimate feeling for its introspective
passages, and the brains to set its tough, conservative structure in clean
relief. A welcome rediscovery; but all that was anti-Soviet about Medtner -
a refined neo-Brahmsian - was his reverence for Western musical models, and
his early departure from Russia to Paris and thence to Golders Green.
Russian pianists have been cultivating his music for many years now.
The 19-year-old Shostakovich's astonishing First Symphony (1925), which
Lazarev expounded in swift, clean lines that left ample room for the
first-desk BBC players to bring their solos to poignant life, was actually a
'Soviet' triumph long before the clampdown by Stalin and Khrennikov. Though
we hear tragic tensions in it, they cannot have had much to do with the
composer's later, well-founded political anxieties.
As for Prokofiev's Eugene Onegin scene-music (1936, for a dramatisation of
Pushkin's verse-novel which was officially thwarted), Edward Downes's
devoted restoration and revival on Monday with the Docklands Sinfonietta and
a team of actors revealed it as moderately interesting, but broken-backed.
The composer would soon recycle the best parts to more developed effect, in
Cinderella, War and Peace and his Seventh Symphony. Here we had costumed
players reading bits of Onegin, Lensky and Tatyana over the orchestra, very
well - but no Olga, nor any dancers at the two grand balls for which
Prokofiev designed several of his 44 numbers.
Though this 'semi-staged' version was less than a dramatisation, it occupied
a long 2 hours and 40 minutes. The director Timothy West also took pawky
relish in the lengthy narration, in Sir Charles Johnston's rhymed couplets.
Rather soon the strenuous hunt for rhymes grew irritating, like the
suppression of articles for scansion's sake - 'avert his chest from pistol's
click': shades of 'Pyramus and Thisbe'] I think Prokofiev's robustly plain
Onegin score wants full-dress staging with a brighter text, or else to be
left alone.

FT  24 MAR 94 / Arts: All tap and no go in 'Hot Shoe Shuffle' - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
About 95 per cent of the dancing in Hot Shoe Shuffle ('The New Tap Musical')
is slick, athletic, high-voltage, strenuous, and utterly devoid of the
spontaneity that true tap is all about. As for the singing, the absence of
spontaneity is nearer 100 per cent. All-singing, all-dancing, Hot Shoe
Shuffle comes to us from Australia, where it was a wow. Judging by the
reaction of the first-night audience here (Australians thick on the ground),
it may wow London. It is not, however, good.
The beauties of tap lie in the plenitude of rhythm, in the surprise of
syncopation, in the elegant phrasing with which dense clusters of steps are
threaded into a larger fluency, in the contrast between those busy feet and
the slower changes of shape shown by the calmly informal upper body, and in
the casual jazz brilliance whereby everything seems to be improvised. The
tap of Hot Shoe Shuffle is tense, forceful, metrically bland.
Only one dance ('Little Brown Jug' danced by a male foursome) has any real
choreographic interest. Elsewhere there are one or two good steps (notably a
kind of thundering stag sissonne in Slap's solo), a too-brief solo for Slide
(Adam Garcia, the only relaxed dancer onstage), a clever use of six men
crossing the stage like a chain (dropping or collecting a soloist as they
pass) - and acres of bashing, hard-and-fast, highly amplified formula.
Though Hot Shoe Shuffle may seem to be about tap dance, it isn't. Written by
Larry Buttrose and Kathryn Riding, set in New York, it's about showbiz,
standard American showbiz, where backstage problems abound but are ironed
out as The Show Goes On in a golden haze of dreams coming true. I can be as
susceptible as the next man to this hackneyed story, as long as it reveals
some real human freshness. But Hot Shoe Shuffle milks every cliche with a
complete lack of irony. Can the Seven Brothers Tap and their newfound
full-grown sister April get this show on the road? 'We've only got four
weeks]' 'Talent's cheap - anyone can have talent. Slick is Sweat.'
The brothers are mean to April, who is taller than them, and can't tap like
them. She leaves. Then they realise that without her they can't win the
millions of dollars bequeathed to them by their father in his will. So they
bring her back - she was just hanging around on the nearest park bench - and
they train her. Then they find there is no money to inherit, and that the
creep who has been rehearsing them so unpleasantly is actually their father.
Never mind; as April says, 'We've got something much more valuable than
money. We're a family.' And the Show Goes On.
All of which could be funny and even touching if it were performed as if all
this were happening for the first time; or as if they found it amusing that
they were stuck in a story that has happened so often before. But no. Very
energetically, these Australians conform to the most insincere and least
witty norm of showbiz style. Which is also the way they sing and dance.
As April, Rhonda Burchmore (5ft 11ins without her heels) has the main
singing role. She puts over 'Long Ago and Far Away', 'How Lucky Can You
Get', 'Birth of the Blues' with brassy panache, no musical individuality,
and a boxy, worn voice that makes her sound 20 years older than the
30-something I presume she is. The evening's most grotesque feature is the
way her high-cut leotard reveals a waxed bikini line and the folds of what
are either her underwear or her tights. As for her facial mannerisms . . .
The forced nature of the whole farrago seems to emanate from David Atkins,
who not only plays Spring (the chief brother) but also has directed and
(with Dein Perry) co-choreographed the whole show. His brow is alarmingly
tense; sweat gleams profusely on his face; and he employs a wretched smirk
amid comic dialogue to indicate he is trying not to 'corpse'. As their
father, Jack Webster gives the most bogus performance of all, determinedly
stale.
Need I go on with this? I love tap, I love almost every song used in this
show, and I loathed the way this show used them.
At the Queen's Theatre.

FT  24 MAR 94 / Technology: The power to invent the future - Xerox pioneered
much of today's PC technology. Its latest work could be as influential
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM FOREMSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If Xerox, the US document-processing company, had turned all its bright
computer ideas into money, it would be one of the richest and most
influential companies in the world.
Located in the heart of Silicon Valley, California, the Xerox Palo Alto
Research Centre (Parc)did the pioneering work for much of today's personal
computer technology. This included the first personal computer, graphical
user interfaces (the link between the user and the computer) featuring icons
and a mouse, laser printers, local area networking and object-oriented
computer languages for faster software development.
Now, two decades after its foundation, Xerox Parc is working on projects
that could become as influential as its earlier efforts. But this time, it
is determined not to let them slip through its fingers and be exploited
successfully by others.
Under the leadership of Xerox's chief scientist, John Seely Brown, the
research centre continues to be a breeding ground of innovative ideas that
could change the way people use and interact with computers. Paul Saffo, a
research fellow at the Institute for the Future, a technology think-tank in
California, says Brown and his colleagues at Xerox Parc are 'producing some
of the most innovative ideas around'.
Xerox likes to be known as 'the document company'. It might seem strange for
a business focused on paper and photocopiers to pioneer computer
technologies that have promised the 'paperless office'. But personal
computer technologies have increased the use of paper: graphical user
interfaces make PCs easier to use and cheap laser printers have helped to
generate more paper documents than before.
'Our mission at Parc is to find novel ways of handling the document,' Brown
explains. 'We recognise that the document is essentially a social artefact.'
This has led to technology such as PaperWorks, which can embed computer
instructions invisibly within paper documents, thus bridging the gap between
paper and electronic documents.
It has also led to the development of advanced computer display screens that
have many of the same qualities as paper documents. Xerox Parc's active
matrix liquid crystal display screens have very high resolutions, better
than laser-printed paper documents.
With its partner, AT&amp;T, Xerox Parc is developing commercial versions of the
LCD screen in a way that could revitalise the LCD industry in the US and win
back market share from Japan.
But it is the acknowledgement that there is a social dimension in the way
computers are used that is producing some of the most interesting
developments at Xerox Parc.
'One of the themes here is how to use the tremendous advances in computer
technologies in a way that will bring simplicity to life and not just keep
adding features and complexity that cause people to feel overwhelmed,' Brown
says.
To make computers more effective, the user interface must be improved. The
best computer interface, as far as Brown and his researchers are concerned,
is one of which they are hardly aware.
Last year, Xerox introduced the LiveBoard, an electronic whiteboard or
chalkboard. Linked by telephone lines or a network, people in remote
locations can draw and write on the 67in-wide LiveBoard screen during
collaborative work sessions. 'The Liveboard is what I like to call
'shoulder-to-shoulder computing'. I've seen people use it and forget that
they are using a computer system,' Brown says.
'It is part of our goal to build computer systems that support a distributed
workplace, with the same kind of social dynamics that we are used to.'
The LiveBoard is part of a concept known as ubiquitous computing. It
envisages a workplace in which people are surrounded by hundreds of
computers. Some are tiny, like the ParcTab, about the size of a Post-It
note, while others are no larger and only slightly thicker than a sheet of
paper.
Workers in this office of the future would wander around with a small
computer ID badge. Through infra-red connections, the badge would announce
them to all the nearby computer devices in their vicinity. It would not only
trigger automatic doors, but also identify users to the computers. During a
meeting, for example, an office worker would be able to use whatever
computer device was nearby to do work, receive messages from colleagues and
send out requests for information. This would essentially take the
'personal' out of personal computer.
Brown explains that providing information to workers at the right time and
'capturing' their knowledge will be of key importance for companies. This is
where adaptive learning comes into play. Brown is the founder of the
California-based Institute for Research on Learning, which addresses the
problems of lifelong learning and how that applies to corporations as well
as individuals.
'There are 100,000 people at Xerox. Each one of us is learning and inventing
every day. If you want to master the enterprise, you have to develop
technologies that capture that knowledge in ways that can be used to benefit
the organisation,' Brown says.
With fast-changing markets and increasing demands for employees to master
new skills, the ubiquitous computers become essential tools that create what
Brown calls a 'knowledgescape'. Computers become gateways for tapping an
organisation's knowledge base and also adding to it.
Like other computer companies, Xerox Parc is also interested in ever smaller
computers. But its focus extends beyond palm-top computers to the molecular
level, a science known as nanotechnology. This borrows some of the
techniques used by makers of silicon chips except that instead of making
electrical circuits, microscopic mechanical machines can be constructed.
The key to developing effective nanotechnologies is being able to manipulate
individual atoms and molecules. Xerox Parc researchers claim that with such
precise control, it would be possible to build a computer no larger than a
sugar cube that would be more powerful than all the world's computers
combined. That, however, is still some way off, even for Xerox Parc.

FT  24 MAR 94 / Technology: Legislation drives the innovators - Optimism
among environmental innovators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The environmental technology industry - which is growing so rapidly that its
sales may exceed world chemicals production by the end of the century - is
holding its showcase UK exhibition this week.
UK companies lag well behind their competitors from Germany, Japan and the
US in the world environmental technology market. According to a recent OECD
report this market is worth Dollars 200bn (Pounds 140bn) a year, with growth
projected to between Dollars 300bn and Dollars 600bn by 2000.
Even so, the 300 exhibitors at the ET94 show in Birmingham were in
optimistic mood. Many believe that the fledgling UK industry is on the brink
of an export breakthrough, with continental Europe the main target.
Exhibitors agreed that growth in all sectors of the market - air pollution
control, water and effluent treatment, and solid waste management - was
driven primarily by legislative requirements.
'If the UK enforces decent environmental legislation, it gives a great
stimulus for us to develop the technology and then use our home market as a
base for expansion into Europe,' says William Averdieck, managing director
of Pollution Control &amp; Measurement Europe.
PCME was founded in 1990 with private funding to commercialise an innovative
dust emissions monitor. The monitor works by detecting the transfer of
electric charge from dust particles to a probe in the factory chimney. It is
particularly suitable for measuring low dust levels in small smokestacks.
There have been two vital ingredients in PCME's success, Averdieck says. One
was the demand created by the 1990 Environmental Protection Act for
industrial dust monitors. The other was a grant from the Department of Trade
and Industry's Environmental Technology Innovation Scheme to develop the
product in collaboration with Imperial College, London, and Johnson Matthey,
the metals group.
Now PCME's D-Tech dust monitor has 60 per cent of the UK market for
small-stack monitoring equipment and export sales are growing. At ET94 this
week, the company launched its first product for the traditional 'large
stack' market, including power station chimneys. It uses 'optical
scintillation' technology to measure dust levels from the variation in a
light beam across the chimney.
However, not all the innovations at ET94 came from new companies. Montec, a
20-year-old company bought last year by Northumbrian Water, has developed a
monitor for low volumes and flows of liquid effluent.
Bryan Jackson, Montec sales engineer, says this market is driven by the
National Rivers Authority's policy of making companies pay to discharge
effluents into rivers and fining them for unauthorised discharges.
Another feature of ET94 is the number of UK government agencies that are
selling environmental services. They include AEA Technology, the
Meteorological Office, Natural Environment Research Council and Adas, the
farm advisory and research service.
The latter carried out Pounds 42m worth of environmental consultancy last
year, according to Chris Stansfield, Adas head of land development. It
expects to pick up more business from the Waste Management Licensing
Regulations which become law on May 1. They will drive up waste disposal
costs and make it more attractive to recycle waste or use it on the land.
Colin Rudd, Adas waste management consultant, says: 'It will certainly pay
producers to conduct feasibility studies in their waste disposal options
now.'
Four years of Adas tests and evaluations have borne fruit for National Power
and PowerGen. These show that gypsum - a mineral produced in large
quantities by 'flue gas desulphurisation' plants from coal-fired power
stations - can be spread on fields to improve the soil, rather than dumped
in expensive landfill sites.

FT  24 MAR 94 / Technology: More than computer experts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Xerox Parc was founded in 1970 and quickly established a reputation as a
hotbed of new computing ideas. The company hired experts not only in
computers but also in other disciplines such as linguistics, anthropology,
psychology and social sciences.
About a third of the 325 researchers have no academic qualifications in
computer science or electrical engineering. Xerox Parc owes much of its
creativity to its campus-like setting and a very informal atmosphere.
Peter Redford, an electronics engineer and president of TV Interactive,
worked there in the 1970s. 'It was an incredible place. If you ran into a
problem, you could talk with all kinds of people in different fields. People
would walk around barefoot and work 20 hours per day. It was a very
comfortable work environment, like working at home,' he said.
While Xerox Parc developed cutting-edge technologies, its parent group was
not very good at marketing them. But others had little trouble in making
money out of ideas born at Xerox Parc. When Steve Jobs, then head of Apple
Computer, and Apple engineers visited Xerox Parc in the late 1970s, they
were amazed. They saw workstations with graphical user interfaces equipped
with a mouse. Jobs is reported to have asked: 'Why aren't you marketing
this?' He had glimpsed the future and began to assemble a team to create a
new Apple system. The team's work led to the Macintosh computer.
Other companies also benefited from the technology at Xerox Parc, including
laser printer makers like Hewlett-Packard, and Microsoft with its Windows
graphical user interface. Xerox Parc staff have gone on to found their own
companies or direct technology development at large computer concerns.
Xerox has learnt from its mistakes in not capitalising on its innovations.
It has a venture capital division which helps to set up spin-off companies
such as ParcPlace Systems, the developers of the object-oriented SmallTalk
language.
Xerox has also entered into partnerships with other companies - as with its
LCD technology - to develop commercial products. It has licensed its
technology and formed new divisions, like the Xerox Advanced Office Document
Systems division, which is developing commercial products based on its
'smart paper' technology.

FT  24 MAR 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Economists in the
salesforce - Drugs companies are focusing their sales efforts on the
financial implications of treatments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The world has changed. We used to market to pharmacists, physicians and
hospitals. Now it will be governments and companies. We must do more than
show that a drug is safe and works. We must demonstrate it has a good
economic outcome.'
These are the words of Jan Leschly, incoming chief executive of Anglo-US
drugs company SmithKline Beecham, at last month's annual results
presentation. He was outlining an important transformation in drugs company
marketing: the recruitment of economists.
The world's drugs companies spend at least Dollars 60bn (Pounds 34.2bn) a
year on sales and marketing, according to analysis by the stockbroker Lehman
Brothers. The figure represents about one-quarter of their total sales
revenue and more than twice as much as they devote to research and
development.
The money is devoured by fleets of sales executives - big names such as
Merck, Glaxo and Pfizer have more than 1,000 in the US alone - as well as by
large budgets to advertise in medical journals.
Making money in pharmaceuticals has long been about persuading doctors to
give up the tried and tested in favour of something new. But that is not
enough any longer. Government healthcare reforms around the world, designed
to tighten controls on spending, have already cut drug prices in Japan and
sales in Europe. Some drugs are no longer available on national health
services. Others have had price cuts imposed.
In the US, the world's biggest market with about one-third of global sales,
the pharmaceutical industry is not only learning to cope with deal-minded
hospital chains and insurance companies, it is bracing itself for the
Clinton administration's reforms.
Drug companies have concluded that they need to convince the organisations
which pay - governments, employers or insurance companies - that a
particular drug offers good financial value.
Sandoz, the Swiss company, for example, has formed a core group of three
economists at its Basel headquarters and several more are employed in
subsidiaries outside Switzerland. They write studies on the economics of
different courses of treatment. Sandoz publishes some of them, others are
submitted to learned journals.
'The pharmaceuticals industry is being increasingly forced to use the tools
of health economics,' says Bill Fulliger, head of corporate marketing at
Sandoz.
'Buyers increasingly require a demonstration of value for money. It is not
public relations, (it is applicable) anywhere there is a competing demand
for health sector funds such as (a decision between) a hip operation or a
kidney transplant,' he adds.
Fulliger argues that the work has already helped to persuade many healthcare
buyers that a kidney transplant, for instance, is cheaper than kidney
dialysis when costs are compared over the longer term. Sales of the
company's drug Sandimmun, which cuts the chances of a new kidney being
rejected, are worth more than SFr1.1bn (Pounds 500m) a year. It is now the
company's biggest selling product.
Glaxo, Europe's biggest drugs company, is using pharmacoeconomists slightly
differently. It first employed them in the US in 1989 and the idea is now
being transplanted to Europe. The company currently employs about 50 people
in the field.
The Glaxo pharmacoeconomists are part of its R&amp;D function: last year the
company split R&amp;D into basic research and 'commercial development'.
The economists work in both groups and the results are used to determine how
'sellable' to payers a drug under development is likely to be, and in the
selling process itself.
Glaxo says its economists are not trying to measure human health in cash
terms. Greg Boyer, a pharmacoeconomist on secondment from Glaxo in the US to
the UK operation, talks of persuading governments of the cost benefit and of
'the value to society' of a new drug.
'We want to be sure that we don't limit ourselves to pounds and dollars. We
want to study the whole patient outcome, to capture patients' ability to do
productive work,' says Boyer. This would mean examining the economic benefit
to a society of using drugs. Would, for example, the sick-pay bill be
reduced, as well as the more direct costs of nursing?
Involving the effect of drug prescribing on society as a whole is an
ambitious goal and not one to which buyers are necessarily sympathetic.
Governments such as Australia's, which requires an economic analysis of a
drug as well as clinical data to be submitted for approval, exclude
reference to the benefits for society. 'Governments are reluctant to allow
that kind of information to get to the negotiating table,' says Boyer. It is
easier to look at the bottom line of a hospital pharmaceuticals budget than
the cost to a country of a treatment, he says.
This has not stopped SmithKline Beecham going down the same route. Bob
Demarinis, head of outcome research and pharmacoeconomics at SmithKline's
Beecham's Pennsylvania offices, says evaluating the widest possible economic
impact is an essential part of his work. His team of eight people works at
all stages from R&amp;D through to the commercialisation of a drug.
Healthcare buyers increasingly demand to know what the effect on their
overall finances will be when they opt for one drug or another, he says.
SmithKline Beecham is recruiting more pharmacoeconomists where it can find
them. The task is not easy: at least one other large pharmaceuticals company
admits that the shortage of qualified people is such that it has to train
them inhouse.

Is everyday low pricing the right retailing strategy for the 1990s?
Yesterday's relatively lacklustre UK results from Kingfisher - the Comet,
B&amp;Q, Superdrug and Woolworth group - raises a question of growing interest
to City analysts and competitors in the retailing industry.
Kingfisher unveiled a jump in 1993 pre-tax profits from Pounds 205m, before
exceptional items, to Pounds 309.3m - apparently a strong performance. But
much of the gain came from last year's Pounds 1bn acquisition of French
electrical retailer Darty, without which earnings growth since 1990 would
have been unexciting.
The blame in some quarters is being put on the strategy promoted by Sir
Geoffrey Mulcahy, Kingfisher chairman, of cutting prices, which has resulted
in lower margins but disappointing volume growth. Sir Geoffrey, however, is
adamant that the approach is sound, but that it needs time.
'The combination of a shift away from promotions and sales to everyday low
pricing, stronger merchandise ranges and significantly improved customer
service generally resulted in promising increases in like-for-like sales,'
he insists.
Everyday low pricing dates back to the start of modern retailing last
century, to Woolworth's 'Five and dime' stores in the US or Marks and
Spencer's penny bazaars in the UK. There have always been 'discount'
retailers concentrating not on high margins, but on selling large volumes of
goods as cheaply as possible.
What refocused attention on the potential of that approach in the late 1980s
 -especially in the US - was the huge success of discount chains such as
Wal-Mart and Kmart, and other new formats such as warehouse clubs, or
'category killers' like Toys R Us, whose central philosophy is EDLP.
The theory is that in chains which tightly control costs, lower prices
should increase volumes and market share, generating increased profits and
buying power which can be used to cut prices further - the so-called
'virtuous circle'.
Other retailers experimented with a consistently low-price stance. The shift
to EDLP was given further impetus in the US when the consumer goods giant
Procter &amp; Gamble decided in 1991 to adopt an EDLP approach in supplying
retailers, ending 'trade allowances' - periodic discounts to retailers to
allow them promote brands at lower prices.
By mid-1992, one US survey found six out of 10 packaged-goods manufacturers
and almost half of all retailers had implemented or tested EDLP.
Now EDLP, value pricing, or 'investing in margin', are becoming buzzwords
among UK retailers - partly in reaction to the recent influx of US and
continental European discount formats.
Kingfisher has been the most vocal proponent, although Sir Geoffrey's EDLP
campaign kicked off in earnest only a year ago, with the introduction of
permanently reduced 'key lines' in his chains. Some retail experts support
his claim that it is too early to judge the results.
They argue customers are slow to pick up the low-price message on
high-ticket products purchased only infrequently - such as those in
Kingfisher's B&amp;Q DIY chain or Comet electrical chain.
Critics counter that the results of EDLP should have been seen more quickly
in lower-ticket chains such as Woolworth. They also point to the apparent
success of EDLP elsewhere.
One example is Marks and Spencer, which has not referred to it as such, but
which some analysts argue has effectively adopted an EDLP approach. Its
'Outstanding Value' campaign, launched in autumn 1992, froze the price of 75
per cent of its products, and reduced the price of the remainder.
The campaign brought a significant increase in volumes, attested to by M&amp;S
suppliers, and a 21 per cent increase in profits in the latest half-year to
Pounds 308m.
Moving to permanently low pricing has been central to the recovery of the
Asda and Gateway grocery chains, after both ran into difficulties in the
early 1990s. Asda was reported last week to be strengthening its commitment
to EDLP with a call to its suppliers to move away from periodic discounts
towards consistently lower prices.
Yet, strangely, a limited move to EDLP does not seem to have worked at the
UK's biggest grocer J Sainsbury, which indefinitely cut the price of 300
own-label products accounting for 10 per cent of sales last October. The
result, revealed in January, was a 0.4 per cent drop in gross margin and a 1
per cent underlying fall in sales.
Analysts suggest that Sainsbury's move, like Kingfisher's, suffered from
poor marketing.
Yet both ran higher-profile campaigns than Marks and Spencer.
'I am still convinced EDLP will play a major role in UK retailing in the
1990s,' says Richard Hyman, director of retail research group Verdict.
'Kingfisher has taken an important step in introducing it into its corporate
strategy.'
Whether or not such predictions come true, it is already clear that simply
cutting prices may not bring customers streaming through the doors. Getting
the range of products and customer service right, and effectively
communicating the message to consumers, are an integral part of the process.

FT  24 MAR 94 / Accountancy Column: Business school winner fails SEC test -
Why the wider use of restructuring charges in the US is meeting opposition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What is the difference between restructuring a company, and investing to
make it more competitive in the future? What exactly is 'business process
re-engineering', the latest faddish idea to sweep out of the business
schools and take hold of corporate America?
For accountants in the US these days, and for investors grappling with the
financial statements of some of the country's biggest companies, these
questions are of more than academic interest.
They are also likely to become of far greater importance elsewhere around
the world in the years to come, as other major economies follow the US out
of recession.
Substantial restructuring charges have been taken by many big US companies
in recent months. They reflect a clearing of the corporate decks, as
companies position themselves for a new period of growth. Such charges,
often running into billions of dollars, also serve a useful accounting
purpose.
By reporting the charges now, in some cases wiping out current period
earnings altogether, companies are able to bring forward costs which they
may not actually incur for several years to come. The effect: to produce a
more flattering profits trend in future.
It is an issue which has vaulted to the top of the list of concerns of
accounting regulators in the US. The Securities and Exchange Commission,
which for months has been murmuring its disquiet about the fashion for big
restructuring charges, wrote last month to around 60 companies which had
reported such items. The regulatory body warned that it will scrutinise
these charges carefully when the companies file their next annual 10-K
reports.
The SEC clearly feels the whole process is open to abuse. 'It looks as if
some companies are including in the restructuring charges the costs of
ordinary operations - for example advertising, legal settlements and the
like,' says Mr Walter Schuetze, the agency's chief accountant.
'It may be some of these are ordinary, on-going, necessary, day-to-day
costs.'
Borden, a troubled foods group, this week became the first public target of
the SEC's new assault on the area. Bowing to pressure from the regulators,
it said it had reversed Dollars 265m of a 1992 restructuring charge. Part of
these costs were reclassified as normal business costs in 1992, part were
carried over into 1993.
Prodded by the SEC, the Financial Accounting Standards Board has also put
the subject on the agenda for its Emerging Issues Task Force. This body was
due to consider the matter at its meeting today.
Finding an answer will not be easy. There is general agreement that some
future costs should be recorded at once; if an asset's value has been
impaired, for instance, or if a company faces a clear liability in future.
But where do you draw the line? The main accounting literature governing
this area, contained in FAS 5 on accounting for contingencies, offers scant
help. This states that costs should be booked at once if they are 'probable'
and 'reasonably estimable'.
How far should this principle be stretched? On the strictest interpretation,
even the costs of a big redundancy programme would not meet this test, says
Mr Michael Conway, head of the professional practice department at KPMG Peat
Marwick. Yet the expected costs of laying off workers, in some cases as part
of a process stretching three years or more into the future, are a common
feature of many restructuring charges.
Other costs that increasingly appear under the general heading of
restructuring charges look still more questionable. Costs associated with
repositioning a product or retraining workers are becoming more common, says
Mr Conway.
Auditors, with little clear guidance to fall back on, are understandably
concerned. How can they resist a particular company's proposed accounting
treatment, particularly if clients of other audit firms have already adopted
it?
Restructuring costs generally fall into two types. In the first, a
struggling company changes its senior management. The new chief executive
moves quickly to shake up the organisation, selling off underperforming
businesses, cutting costs and laying off workers, reorganising the
businesses that are left. The company takes a big restructuring charge to
cover the costs of the whole process.
The biggest example of this last year was IBM's Dollars 8.9bn charge to
cover one of the US's biggest-ever corporate restructurings. IBM - which
stated it was not among the companies to receive a letter from the SEC, 'to
the best of our knowledge' - said Dollars 6bn of the cost was to cover
reductions in its workforce, while the rest was to meet reductions in
manufacturing capacity and excess space.
In the second type of restructuring, an existing management team decides it
needs to act radically to make itself more competitive. This usually happens
in a mature, low-growth industry - banking, say, or the provision of
telephone services. The company rethinks how it carries out its most basic
activities, in the process simplifying its business processes and
eliminating layers of management, an approach which these days goes under
the all-embracing term 're-engineering'.
Should these costs also be grouped under the general heading of
restructuring charges? The issue clearly causes concern in some quarters. 'I
don't know what re-engineering means - it's a fashionable concept,' said Mr
Schuetze at the SEC.
Recent charges taken by three US 'Baby Bells' (regional telephone companies)
illustrate the dilemma. Between them, Nynex, Pacific Telesis and Bell South
reported charges totalling nearly Dollars 3bn for the fourth quarter of last
year.
Pacific Telesis said its Dollars 576m of charges reflected an intention to
cut 10,000 jobs over the next three years, and what it called 'process
re-engineering', though it gave little detail.
Nynex, based in New York, said that Dollars 400m of its Dollars 1.6bn of
charges was earmarked to cover costs associated with the company's 'efforts
to fundamentally re-engineer the way it delivers services to its customers,
including operation by its telephone companies as a single enterprise under
the 'Nynex' brand'. Amongst other things, the company said its charges would
meet the costs of 'retraining employees, relocation expenses (and) systems
re-engineering'.
Included in Bell South's Dollars 1.2bn of charges were similar-sounding
costs. Some Dollars 550m of the cost 'is related to implementing new,
state-of-art systems', it said. Announcing the charges, Mr John Clendenin,
chairman and chief executive, was quoted in a press release issued by the
company as saying: 'We're changing the way we do business. We're speeding up
our service efforts, investing in new systems, and just making it easier for
our customers to deal with us.'
Can these really be termed restructuring charges? The pace of technological
change means that many companies face bigger and more frequent spending on
new equipment, shorter product cycles and constant organisational upheaval.
How long will it be before accountants find a better way for companies'
accounts to reflect this new business reality?

Training mediators as well as coping with such hands-on jobs as sorting out
a dispute between a minister and his church elders are among the challenges
facing David Richbell in his new job as director of training at the Centre
for Dispute Resolution.
It is a job that 50-year-old Richbell, a lay preacher and fully accredited
CEDR mediator, says he will find deeply satisfying. 'Mediation fulfils my
belief in reconciliation and peacemaking,' he says. 'I am extremely unhappy
with the adversarial legal system as this polarises people into more
entrenched roles.'
CEDR is much smaller than Acas, the advisory, arbitration, and conciliation
service which is financially backed by the government. Rather, CEDR is an
independent, non-profit making organisation, backed by a number of bodies
including the Confederation of British Industry. Richbell says CEDR can
handle any kind of mediation between parties in dispute, except criminal
cases.

FT  24 MAR 94 / People: Pentos seeks to turn over a new leaf at Dillons
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Pentos has had a rough time of things lately; no signs of fair weather in
the offing yet either, as Frank Brazier, 50, chief executive of Dillons, the
bookstore chain, yesterday abruptly cleared his desk and departed from the
Pentos board and the helm of Dillons after spending 11 years with the
company.
Bill McGrath, Pentos' chief executive, was unavailable for comment on
Brazier's resignation, though his going will inevitably be seen in the
context of Pentos' recent financial and structural difficulties, which some
close to the company describe as a 'horrible mess'. McGrath formally took
over as chief executive at the beginning of this year.
Analysts are forecasting significant group losses for the current year's
trading, following exceptional charges likely to be near the Pounds 30m
mark.
Having paid Pounds 3.7m for 53 Ryman Computer Stores two years ago, Pentos
sold off the chain for Pounds 100,000 at the beginning of this year to
People's Phone. Some of the group's 172 Athena poster shops are believed to
be on the market. Group debts peaked at Pounds 86m before Christmas.
Strapped for cash, Pentos is imminently expected to announce a rights issue
in order to fill a black hole which some expect to be as high as Pounds 65m
in total losses this year.
Back in February the group was ticked off by the Financial Reporting Review
Panel for failing sufficiently to disclose the level reverse premiums on its
shop leases - the payments made by landlords to attract key tenants -
contributed to 1992 profits.
Turning the pages of Pentos' recent fortunes has not, therefore, been a
happy experience, and recovery will not be easy.
Evidently McGrath has thought it time to act, and to address Dillons'
problems at a senior level, Paul Hogarth, 51, has been brought back to be
operations director from a similar role with another part of the group, the
Ryman stationery stores.
Meanwhile, Brazier's successor is to be Joe Sinyor, 36, former chief
executive of the clothing company Pepe Group between 1990 and 1992. Sinyor's
title will be managing director at Dillons; he will have his feet under the
table by the end of March. His strategic expertise will come in handy at
Dillons, where control over inventory levels and management information
systems is regarded as having gone rather awry.

Why should a former chief secretary and deputy governor of the Turks &amp;
Caicos Islands, one of the UK's few remaining dependent territories, have
heard of Kapiti? And what made him take the post of human resources director
with one of the UK's more outlandishly named financial systems suppliers?
The answer is that Mark Forrester, now 49, has had a broad and varied career
including spells as private secretary to both Sir Edward Heath and Lord
Wilson and head of personnel for Paribas Capital markets group. He learned
about Kapiti, a private company with New Zealand connections and turnover to
end 1992 of Pounds 24.3m, through spells with banking groups including
County Bank, the merchant banking subsidiary of National Westminster. His
experiences abroad qualify him to help Kapiti expand its international
operations.
Educated at the Royal Grammar School, High Wycombe, Forrester spent the
early part of his life in Whitehall, eventually moving into the
establishment arm of the Civil Service and taking responsibility for
personnel budgeting, training and pay negotiation.
He joined the banking world in time to enjoy the City's Big Bang and its
consequences and in 1992 took on a contract as head of administration for
the Turks &amp; Caicos Islands, responsible for 1,200 civil servants and 13,000
islanders.
He claims not to miss Grand Turk, six square miles of the West Indies that
was his home for two years. The nearest he gets to it these days is Kapiti's
Slough headquarters, incongruously named Key West.
Ben Maddocks, 45, who joined Kapiti at the same time as marketing director,
also has Caribbean connections. For a spell he worked in Bermuda with
American International, the bellwether among property and casualty insurers.
His background, however, is not in insurance but in chemistry and
physiology. Educated at the University of Aston in Birmingham, he explains
that an understanding of physiological processes is an excellent preparation
for business process re-engineering and other transformations undergone by
corporate bodies as well as living ones.
He learned financial management with Burroughs Corporation and the Legal &amp;
General group where he reckons to have been one of the first in the
insurance industry to introduce standard costing techniques - commonplace
these days, but revolutionary in the 1970s.
After American International in Bermuda he worked with management
consultants Touche Ross in Toronto and Price Waterhouse in the UK.
His most recent role has been as managing director of Camsco in London, a
subsidiary of Creditanstalt-Bankverein, the Austrian banking group. Camsco
provides organisational and information technology services to the bank's
international network.
A disagreement over strategy with the management of Creditanstalt led to him
joining Kapiti in February this year.
The company was a pioneer of integrated banking packages in the 1970s and
has continued to innovate in financial packages, including programs that
operate in Japanese, Arabic and Cyrillic languages. Maddocks sees his role
as interpreting the demand of the marketplace and ensuring they are met.

FT  24 MAR 94 / Vets threaten protest over low EU training standards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British vets warned yesterday that they were prepared to break European
Union law by refusing to allow vets from certain member states to work in
the UK unless training standards in those countries were raised.
The warning comes after a series of outbreaks of disease on British farms
linked to infected animals imported from the EU or eastern Europe. Vets
expect these outbreaks to increase because the single market has led to a
sharp rise in the movement of animals.
Livestock must be accompanied by certificates saying it is free of disease.
But British vets believe checks are not always carried out properly.
The Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons, to which all vets must belong to
practice in the UK, said it was concerned about training standards in Italy,
Spain and Greece.
In some colleges veterinary students could graduate 'without laying a finger
on a live animal throughout their five-year course'.
Mr Barry Johnson, the college's president, said: 'We do not want to break
the law. But we may be compelled to if we felt the standards were not high
enough and all other passages were blocked to us.'
The college, backed by Mrs Gillian Shephard, agriculture minister, is
pressing the European Commission to drop plans to withdraw funding of
Ecu60,000 (Pounds 45,000) a year for regular visits by independent experts
to all veterinary schools in the EU. The aim of these visits is to ensure
common standards are maintained.
Mrs Judy MacArthur Clark, the college's vice-president, said: 'We are
dismayed that the Commission is proposing to withdraw its funding to the
European system of visitations and monitoring, which means we will have no
means of quality control over vets . . . permitted to practice in the UK.
'We are also very concerned that this high standard of veterinary training
is essential to prevent many animal diseases being introduced into Europe
from elsewhere in the world.'

FT  24 MAR 94 / Tax dodge measures slammed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Leading tax and accountancy professionals yesterday criticised proposed
legislation intended to stop tax avoidance through offshore companies.
The Institute of Taxation said measures in the finance bill were
over-complex, would impose large compliance costs on firms and give
undefined powers to the Inland Revenue.
Mr Malcolm Gammie, president of the Institute of Taxation, said: 'The cost
of complying with these new rules will hit everyone, not merely those
companies engaged in tax avoidance.'
Mr Tony Hughes, of accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand, said: 'The government has
not listened to our concerns, which is very disappointing. But we note that
the Treasury will be setting up a working party into how the legislation
will operate.'
The criticism comes after MPs voted through clause 123 of the finance bill
on Tuesday. The clause closes a loophole in existing legislation which
protects against avoidance of UK tax by companies diverting income to
subsidiaries in low tax areas overseas.
Profits - which a foreign non-trading subsidiary must distribute to the UK
if it wishes to avoid charges under foreign company legislation - must now
be calculated on a tax rather than on an accounts basis.
The government says companies use accounting tricks to disguise profits,
costing the exchequer at least Pounds 50m each year. But leading companies
and accounting bodies complain that the new rules impose a heavy burden on
companies and they apply retrospectively.
Inland Revenue officials yesterday denied that clause 123 would be
retrospective and said that they were prepared to discuss new legislation
with tax practitioners and publish guidelines.
Last Thursday the government was forced to withdraw clause 241 of the
finance bill after pressure from politicians and tax and accounting bodies.
The clause would have increased the power of the Inland Revenue to seize
books and records.
Mr Gammie said: 'Both clauses are badly drafted and provide inadequate
safeguards against their exercise. If the Revenue needs extra powers it
should have them, but it is unclear and uncertain as to how far the
Revenue's powers extend. We are having to rely on the Revenue fulfilling
assurances made in private rather than on the record.'

FT  24 MAR 94 / Prescott says Labour must focus on redistribution of work as
well as wealth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART and ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Labour party will have to focus on redistribution of work as much as
redistribution of wealth, Mr John Prescott, shadow employment secretary,
said yesterday, David Goodhart and Robert Taylor write.
Mr Prescott said the market was distributing work unsatisfactorily between
the employed and the unemployed and between full-time and part-time workers.
In recent years 3m full-time jobs had been replaced by 1.5m part-time and
1.5m self-employed.
Since taking over as Labour employment spokesman after the party conference
last year, Mr Prescott has had a relatively low profile on labour market
issues - with the exception of harrying the government on the issue of
unemployment statistics. However, new thinking on the subject will come with
the publication of the party's response to the European Commission's green
paper on social policy published at the end of last year.
The response, under the title Jobs and Social Justice, is likely to further
Mr Prescott's reputation as a moderniser in traditionalist clothing.
The Labour document is likely to concentrate on establishing new links
between employment and social security to take account of changes in working
and family lives. Mr Prescott says new thinking on the Continent is coming
from 'the Keyneses and Beveridges of our time'.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Gloucestershire has suffered the sharpest fall in overall employment in
Britain, a report on the county's economy by Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the
accountancy firm, shows.
It said the recession and cuts in the defence industry, on which the county
relies, meant unemployment nearly tripled between 1990 and 1993.
Industries which have grown rapidly in the 1980s, such as financial
services, have stalled.

FT  24 MAR 94 / Three unions 'live beyond means'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Three unions are living substantially beyond their means and one has
virtually no assets, the latest published accounts in the 1993 report of the
certification officer for trade unions and employer organisations.
The three were Ucatt, the construction union, the RMT transport and rail
union, and the GPMU print union.
Ucatt had total expenditure of Pounds 7.4m and income of Pounds 5.4m but net
assets of only about Pounds 400,000. The RMT had expenditure of Pounds 13.7m
and income of Pounds 10.5m but a healthier asset base of Pounds 15.3m.
The GPMU had the biggest shortfall between spending of Pounds 35.5m and
income of Pounds 29.4m but recorded one of the biggest asset bases of any
trade union at just over Pounds 72m.

FT  24 MAR 94 / More staff cuts at Alliance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Alliance &amp; Leicester building society yesterday announced that it is to shed
up to 550 jobs, almost all before the end of next year, as part of its
restructuring, which includes integration of personal customers of its
Girobank subsidiary with those of the society.
Mr Paul Clifton, director in charge of human resources, said the effect
would be felt in administration, where the group wanted to flatten its
management structures. The aim is to ensure that it can make faster
decisions.
The job losses come on top of an announcement last November that about 700
jobs would be lost over the next four years as a result of the closure of
the society's headquarters in Hove. Mr Clifton said he did not expect any
further job losses as a result of the organisational review.
Mr Clifton said he regretted the job losses, but tight control over costs
was essential.

FT  24 MAR 94 / Unit trust sales up 50% to Pounds 722m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unit trusts sales of Pounds 722.4m last month were almost 50 per cent higher
than in January and compared with Pounds 580.5m in February last year,
Scheherazade Daneshkhu writes.
Retail demand has again been heavy, with almost three quarters of last
month's net sales - Pounds 530m - made by private investors. Many savers
have been turning to equities as an alternative to building societies at a
time of relatively low interest rates.
Last week the Building Societies Association reported net outflow of funds
of Pounds 404m after a net outflow of Pounds 265m in January.
The most popular sectors with private investors were the five UK equity fund
sectors which attracted a net Pounds 335m of investment. UK and European
funds qualify for full Personal Equity Plan allowances, which allow
individuals to invest in equities tax-efficiently. The best-selling sector
among private investors were the international growth funds.
Institutions favoured Japan and there was a shift away from the 'Far East
excluding Japan sector' into 'Far East including Japan' funds.

FT  24 MAR 94 / Malaysia contact admitted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A government minister triggered renewed speculation about the lengths to
which the UK went to secure trade with Malaysia in the 1980s by admitting
that Britain was formally approached by Kuala Lumpur over a sensitive legal
case.
Mr Alastair Goodlad, a Foreign Office minister, said that Britain received
representations from Malaysia over the trial of Mr Lorrain Osman, a
Malaysian banker who was accused of taking part in a fraud in Hong Kong.
Mr Goodlad did not reveal details of the exchanges between British and
Malaysian officials between 1983 and 1993. But his statement added to
newspaper speculation that the government withheld important telexes from Mr
Osman's trial in exchange for Malaysia's decision to buy Pounds 1.3bn of
British military equipment.
Mr Goodlad's response came in a parliamentary written answer to Mr Alex
Carlile, the Liberal Democrat MP for Montgomery. He is pressing ministers to
release the telexes suppressed in the Osman case under the system of public
interest immunity certificates.
Dr Kua Kia Soong, an opposition leader in Kuala Lumpur, is reported to have
claimed in the Malaysian parliament that his country had agreed to buy arms
from Britain to avoid the release in court of 'sensitive documents' which
could have implicated Malaysian politicians in a banking scandal.
The Commons public accounts committee will next week produce a highly
critical report on the government's support for Malaysia's Pergau dam
project.

FT  24 MAR 94 / Watchdog urged to probe education adverts spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's spending watchdog is to be asked to investigate allegations
that the Department for Education has 'misused' public funds in advertising
its policies.
Mr Robert Sheldon, Labour chairman of the Commons' Public Accounts
Committee, said he would ask the National Audit Office to investigate
spending on publicity at the department following a complaint from Mrs Ann
Taylor, shadow education secretary.
Mrs Taylor has written to Mr Sheldon claiming that the department's annual
expenditure on advertising had risen 8,000 per cent since the Conservatives
came to power - from Pounds 103,800 in 1979-80 to Pounds 8.9m in 1991-92.
'Without exception, parents complain of money being wasted which could
usefully be spent on schools,' Mrs Taylor said.
A submission to the NAO is usually the first step in a parliamentary
investigation of how public money is spent.
If the watchdog agrees to produce an official report, the committee can
investigate the matter, cross-examining ministers and officials.
The Liberal Democrats yesterday joined the attack, arguing that officials at
the department had broken their own code of practice in their recent
advertising campaign for the promotion of grant maintained schools. Mr Don
Foster, Liberal Democrat education spokesman, accused the department of
issuing 'biased advertisements' which implied that only governors and head
teachers of grant maintained schools had the power to make decisions on
their own expenditure - and that local education authority school governors
had no financial control.
'The adverts are a clear breach of practice in that the information is
presented in such a way as to be hugely misleading,' said Mr Foster.
'Ministers have been contradicting each other in an attempt to defend them.'
Mr Foster's complaint is being submitted to the parliamentary ombudsman.

social policy published at the end of last year. Mr Prescott says new
thinking on the Continent is coming from 'the Keyneses and Beveridges of our
time'.
The Labour document is likely to concentrate on establishing new links
between employment and social security to take account of changes in working
and family lives.
Mr Prescott, in his second stint as employment spokesman, has coined the
slogan 'back to principles' and has no qualms about traditional concepts
such as returning to 'full employment'.
But he is evidently riled by the fact that Mr Tony Blair, the shadow home
secretary, who took over the employment portfolio in the late 1980s, was
seen as a brave new thinker while he was regarded as the image of labourist
orthodoxy.
He is happy enough now to insist that 'Labour must look after the interests
of all employees and potential employees not just those people in unions or
with secure jobs'.
He is even prepared to criticise Usdaw, the shopworkers union, for doing a
deal with the big retailers over Sunday working which ensures generous
overtime for existing workers at the expense of new jobs.
As the mastermind behind Labour's ideas on private/public partnership, Mr
Prescott is keen not to be too overshadowed by Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow
chancellor, and Mr Robin Cook, shadow industry spokesman, on broader
economic issues.

FT  24 MAR 94 / RPI rise biggest for 10 months
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
February's 0.6 per cent rise in the retail prices index was the largest
monthly increase since April last year and marks the end of a series of
better-than-expected inflation figures.
Nearly all the main categories of the RPI showed price increases in February
as prices bounced back from the effects of the January sales.
The biggest single increase was in clothing and footwear, where prices rose
by 2.7 per cent over the month, the largest February rise since 1941.
However, that followed a 5.1 per cent fall in January, the largest monthly
drop since 1921. Clothing and footwear contributed 0.16 per cent to the
RPI's 0.6 per cent monthly rise.
Prices of personal goods and services rose 2.3 per cent over the month,
mainly because of increases in the prices of spectacles, following the
January sales.
Although prices of food and motoring expenditure rose by 0.6 per cent over
the month, both increases were smaller than in February 1993. This meant
that February's RPI increase was smaller than the 0.7 per cent recorded in
February last year, allowing the annual rate to drop back to 2.4 per cent
from 2.5 per cent in January. If mortgage interest payments are excluded,
the annual increase in underlying inflation was 2.8 per cent, the same as in
January.
The RPI rose to 142.1 in February, after falling 0.4 per cent to 141.3 in
January. February's increase still means that the RPI is only 0.1 per cent
higher than its September 1993 level.
Analysts were divided on whether the figures represented a resumption of
inflationary pressures, or were merely a blip. 'The inflation figures are
not as bad as they look,' said Mr Kit Juckes, economist at SG Warburg
Securities. 'There is not enough strength in the economy for the price
increases to stick.'
Mr Adrian Cooper, UK economist at James Capel, said he still believed that
inflation would fall below 2 per cent. He pointed to recent weak producer
prices figures, arguing that they were a forward indicator of the RPI. Capel
estimates that core inflation over the last three months has been running at
an annualised rate of 1.6 per cent.
However, Mr John Marsland, an economist at UBS, said: 'We think the recent
price increases will stick and we will see further small increases over the
rest of the year.' UBS forecasts that underlying inflation will be 3.25 per
cent by the end of this year, and headline inflation will be 3.5 per cent.
The Central Statistical Office has produced its new weightings for the RPI
in 1994, a move which led to the monthly inflation figures being published a
week later than normal.
The main change is the inclusion of UK holidays for the first time: foreign
holidays made their debut last year. The effect has been to increase the
weighting of leisure services.

FT  24 MAR 94 / Cashflow audit compliance stressed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Companies must continue to comply with the requirements of the cashflow
statement in spite of plans to revise it next year, the UK accounting
standards watchdog warned yesterday.
The Financial Reporting Review Panel said that companies must fully obey the
provisions now contained in FRS 1 - the cashflow statement standard
introduced in September 1991.
The panel's statement was intended to remove any suggestion that revisions
of FRS 1 being considered by the Accounting Standards Board would permit
less rigorous compliance with existing requirements.
The panel has already publicly reprimanded four companies for failing to
implement FRS 1 effectively. Control Techniques, Breverleigh Investments, BM
Group and Intercare have all been criticised on these grounds.
In none of the cases did the auditors - Coopers &amp; Lybrand, Copeland &amp; Co,
Kingston Smith and Price Waterhouse respectively - qualify the accounts.
The panel is also believed to have considered several other companies which
failed to comply with FRS 1, but which it chose not to pursue. The companies
argued that the misclassifications in the accounts were trivial and were
explained by the difficulties in interpreting the new standard.

FT  24 MAR 94 / Curb on charity accounts planned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Charity Commission intends to clamp down on charities which present
misleading information in their accounts by failing to comply with new
accounting guidelines, it emerged yesterday.
A letter circulated in the last few weeks suggests that new statutory
guidelines on charity accounting, reporting and auditing have been
substantially delayed by the government and are unlikely to appear before
the summer at the earliest.
The letter from Mr Michael Webber, a charity commissioner, was sent to all
who commented on Sorp 2, the draft statement of recommended practice for
charities.
Sorp 2 attracted widespread criticism when it was circulated early last year
and was revised after discussions with the Accounting Standards Board, which
highlighted a number of areas in which it contradicted UK standards for
companies. About 350 bodies commented on the draft.
The Charity Commission has taken on responsibility for ratifying Sorp 2, the
previous version of which was issued by the Institute of Chartered
Accountants in England and Wales.
Mr Webber says in the letter that the commission will not criticise
charities simply for failing to comply with Sorp 2, which is not mandatory.
But it will criticise charities if this failure leads to 'a distorted,
misleading or unclear view of some aspects of the charity's affairs'. He
warns that any departures will have to be 'clearly justified in a positive
way'.
He says a revised version of Sorp 2 will be issued with Home Office draft
regulations, which are not expected until after June. A statement on the
timetable is expected in the first half of this year.
Mr Webber stresses the need for the guidelines to reflect the burden of
compliance with the accounting guidelines on smaller charities.
The financial difficulties facing charities are highlighted in the Henderson
Top 2,000 charities survey, published this week, which shows that 31
charities have had their accounts qualified by their auditors.
Of the 2,071 charities analysed, more than 17 per cent did not even have a
full audit.

FT  24 MAR 94 / Institutions boost investment levels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Investment by UK pension funds, insurance companies, investment and unit
trusts shot up last year, reflecting the rebuilding of personal savings and
a switch by savers away from cash to securities.
The Central Statistical Office said yesterday that total net investment by
institutions in 1993 was a record Pounds 52.2bn, compared with Pounds 35.8bn
in 1992.
It was also at a record Pounds 14.9bn in the fourth quarter of last year, up
from Pounds 13.6bn in the third.
'The figures show that the personal savings are there, and are finding their
way to the investment institutions,' said Mr Kevin Gardiner, UK economist at
Morgan Stanley. 'Consumers no longer want to hold their assets in the form
of money but want to put them into securitised savings.'
Particularly striking was a sharp jump in land and property investment in
the fourth quarter, a move that highlighted a decisive change in investors'
sentiments towards the UK property and land market.
Net investment in 'other' assets increased to Pounds 2.3bn in the three
months to December, reflecting investment of Pounds 1bn in UK land, property
and ground rent. This followed disinvestment in the previous two quarters.
Investment in UK company shares also rose from a net Pounds 4.1bn in the
third quarter to Pounds 4.9bn in the fourth. Institutions' net investment in
overseas securities rose from Pounds 3bn to Pounds 3.6bn.
Overall, the annual level of net investment in both UK and overseas company
securities increased substantially last year. For UK company shares the
amount rose from Pounds 8.1bn in 1992 to Pounds 20.9bn. After a
disinvestment of Pounds 0.5bn in overseas companies in 1992, flows last year
increased to Pounds 11.2bn.
Investment in UK government bonds, or gilts, remained strong, although last
year's net investment of Pounds 13.2bn fell short of 1992's record Pounds
15.4bn net total.
Looked at by institutional group, the CSO figures show that all groups,
apart from pension funds, increased their net investment last year. The
increase was particularly marked for unit trusts which enjoyed their best
ever year for inflows from private investors. Net investment by unit trusts
rose from Pounds 1.4bn in 1992, to a record Pounds 10.8bn last year.
In the fourth quarter, activity by investment trusts staged the most
striking pick-up. This partly reflected the launch of several new trusts at
the end of last year that took advantage of new legislation allowing
corporate investment in Lloyd's of London, the insurance market, for the
first time.
As a result, total net investment was a record Pounds 1.9bn in the fourth
quarter, compared with Pounds 66m in the third.
Net investment by pension funds increased slightly to Pounds 2.15bn in the
fourth quarter. This brought the total for the year to Pounds 8bn, a similar
level to the previous two years.
Net investment by unit trusts and property unit trusts at Pounds 2.6bn in
the fourth quarter was still at an exceptionally high level.

FT  24 MAR 94 / Mercury raises fears on BT 'superhighway'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mercury, the main competitor to British Telecommunications, yesterday
opposed construction of a national fibre-optic 'superhighway'.
However, it supported lifting the ban on BT providing entertainment services
in return for a more favourable regulatory regime.
Lord Young, chairman of Cable &amp; Wireless, Mercury's parent company, told the
Commons trade and industry committee that he favoured the development of
competing local networks to deliver services rather than a BT fibre-optic
monopoly at local level.
In the most detailed explanation yet of Mercury's plans to deploy wireless
technology to by-pass BT at the local level, Lord Young said Mercury
expected to have between 3m and 5m customers accessing its long-distance
network through radio links 'in a few years'.
The radio networks would be able to carry broadcast channels in addition to
telephony.
Lord Young told the committee, which is examining the case for a national
fibre-optic grid, that a grid 'would not bring any additional benefits for
business and residential customers'. Instead there should be 'a range of
competing technologies and competing operators'. He added: 'Britain has
advanced too far down the competitive road to revert to a utility-style
single national grid.'
Lord Young renewed Mer-cury's call for a regulatory regime more favourable
to it, claiming the company would support a lifting of the ban on BT
carrying entertainment over its network before 1998 'provided we have
economic access to the BT network'.
Mercury is locked in a legal dispute with Oftel, the telecommunications
regulator, about terms for inter-connection to the BT network, which it
believes are unduly restrictive.
The Cable Television Association also opposed a national fibre grid. It
represents the - mostly US - cable companies building combined cable TV and
telephone networks in urban areas.

FT  24 MAR 94 / Rival to Coke may go to Sainsbury
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A new cola brand which could revolutionise the Pounds 1.2bn retail market
for carbonated drinks in the UK may be launched in May by J. Sainsbury, the
UK's biggest grocery chain.
Cott Corporation, the fast growing Canadian marketing and bottling company,
said yesterday that it was at an advanced stage of negotiations with
Sainsbury on a proposal to launch a 'sub-brand' which would incorporate both
the Sainsbury logo and a new marque.
Mr Simon Lester of Cott said the peak selling time for carbonated drinks was
at the end of May. The group wanted any launch to be before that time.
Over the past three years Cott has captured about 20 per cent of the
Canadian cola market and 2 per cent of the US market through the launch of
supermarket sub-brands. Its share price has increased 100-fold over the same
period.
Sainsbury would aim to produce a better quality cola than traditional
supermarket brands and sell it for a higher price, although it would be
cheaper than Coca Cola or Pepsi Cola, which are about Pounds 1 for two
litres.
Mr Lester said Sainsbury and Cott were considering a series of possible
names for the new brand. They included variations of marques used by Cott in
the US and Canada, such as Sam's American Choice, Select and President's
Choice. Another possibility is Classic.
Coca Cola's leading US brand is called Classic and the company said it would
sue for breach of copyright if Sainsbury were to borrow any of its names or
package the product in a way which was too close to its own packaging.
Sainsbury refused to comment on the negotiations.

The so-called Big Four UK pension fund managers outperformed the average in
1993, but by a far smaller margin than in recent years, Combined Actuarial
Performance Services, which measures pension fund manager returns, reported
yesterday, Norma Cohen writes.
The four are Mercury Asset Management, Schroders Investment Management, PDFM
and Gartmore. The Big Four earned total returns on their portfolios,
exclusive of property investments, of 29.3 per cent. The median market
return was 29.3 per cent. But in the five year period 1989 through 1993, the
Big Four earned median returns of 18 per cent per year while the median
return was 17.2 per cent.

FT  24 MAR 94 / City banker jailed for six years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Wallace Duncan Smith, the former City merchant banker convicted of a
sophisticated Pounds 100m fraud on banks and other financial institutions,
was jailed for six years at the Old Bailey yesterday.
The former chairman and joint managing director of Wallace Smith Trust
Company, a small merchant bank, was convicted last month on one charge of
fraudulent trading and two of obtaining property by deception after a
three-month trial.
Sentencing him, Mr Justice Tuckey said: 'The size of the loss must make it
one of, if not the most, serious case of fraudulent trading to come before
the courts.'
The judge accepted that small investors had not been among the losers from
Mr Smith's fraud. However, he said it was no mitigation to say that the
losers had only been banks and other financial institutions.
'They lost because they trusted you,' said Mr Justice Tuckey. 'Trust is
still a valuable, and in some cases an essential, part of commercial life.
You abused it and must inevitably have damaged the reputation of the City of
London in doing so.'
Wallace Smith Trust Company began to run into severe financial problems in
1990. To cover the losses, Mr Smith committed a series of frauds to give the
impression that his bank was trading profitably. At the heart of his fraud
was the practice of 'double-dipping' - the use and re-use of certificates of
deposit to obtain a series of loans from banks.
To avoid detection, Mr Smith laundered the money out of the UK into two
shell companies in Canada before routing it back to his bank by charging
them bogus management fees. To keep the true nature of these Canadian
companies secret, he deliberately appointed accountants seeking short-term
work to act as their directors.
In April 1991 he committed his largest fraud when he cheated the Discount
Bank and Trust Company of Pounds 25m using fictitious Canadian bonds.
Mr Smith was jailed for six years concurrently on each of the three counts.
He was disqualified from being a company director for 12 years and told that
if he did not meet a confiscation order within six months, another year
would be added to his sentence.
The court heard that under the limited confiscation order Mr Smith has to
repay cash reflecting the value of shotguns and rifles he had given to his
son after his arrest and just before a Mareva injunction - which freezes his
assets worldwide - was issued.

FT  24 MAR 94 / North Sea oilfield projects approved
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday approved the development of the Fife and Birch
oilfields in the North Sea.
The development of Fife, east of Aberdeen, is of particular significance, as
it will use a floating production and storage system on a converted tanker.
The floating production systems are among the latest innovative methods to
tap small reserves which would not be economic using a fixed platform.
Amerada Hess and Premier Consolidated Oilfields, partners in the Fife field,
will lease a vessel which will be moored over the field for the four years
or so that it will take to drain the estimated 34m-barrel reservoir.
The vessel will be secured to the seabed by nine chains attached to undersea
piles. It will rotate around a turret through which pipelines attached to
the wells will pass. The ship's normal propulsion unit will be retained to
allow it to move if very severe storms arise. Normal winter weather should
not affect production.
Mr Tim Kieft, Fife project manager, said the field would not have been
developed without the advent of the floating systems.
Under the chartering arrangement the two partners will avoid costly capital
outlays and the cost of abandoning structures, which are considerable in the
case of fixed platforms, will be minimal.
The owners of the vessel, Bluewater Offshore, will pay for its conversion.
After Fife they will be free to charter it to other companies for similar
developments.
Birch, the other field approved yesterday, is in the central North Sea.

FT  24 MAR 94 / Pollution control earns trade surplus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British environmental technology companies generate a trade surplus of
Pounds 234m annually, a government report said yesterday, Bronwen Maddox
writes.
The world market for pollution control equipment and services is worth about
Dollars 210bn (Pounds 144bn) and will grow to about Dollars 320bn by 2000
and Dollars 570bn by 2010, the report estimates.
'The view that the UK is unsuccessful in overseas markets for environmental
equipment is clearly a myth,' it says.
The UK is particularly strong in water treatment, according to the report,
prepared by the consultancy Ecotec and a research group. The UK's expertise
in water technology has developed during the industry's modernisation
programme, which could cost about Pounds 40bn this decade.
Western Europe accounts for 29 per cent of the UK's exports and North
America 48 per cent.

FT  24 MAR 94 / Military homes to go private
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Government plans to transfer service personnel homes into the private sector
could raise around Pounds 500m through an arrangement described yesterday as
'a sort of finance lease' by Lord Cranbourne, the defence minister.
The deal, which is essential to bridge a gap of more than Pounds 500m in
next year's defence budget, involves creating a non-profit-making housing
trust to own and manage the homes.
The aim is to structure the deal so that money raised to finance the
transfer and modernise the dilapidated housing stock falls outside the
public sector borrowing requirement.
To achieve this the Treasury will have to be convinced that the lenders have
assumed enough of the risk for the deal to amount to more than creative
accounting. Generally, Treasury experts have not regarded finance leases as
involving sufficient transfer of risk.
Under the plan, 68,000 armed services married quarters will be transferred
under 30-year leases to the housing trust. The trust will be independent of
the defence ministry, but will contract with it to provide accommodation for
married service personnel and to improve its quality.
Capital for the deal will be raised in the City, secured against the future
stream of rental income. 'Lenders will take the risk that the basis of
paying rents changes, or that the size of the married quarters estate
changes,' said Lord Cranbourne.
Major-General James Johnstone, chairman of the new trust, said yesterday
that City soundings indicated that the money could be raised without
distorting current housing market finance.
Housing associations currently raise around Pounds 1bn a year to finance
their building programmes and purchase local authority homes.
The trust will seek to find tenants for married quarters not immediately
required by the armed services. Fourteen per cent of the stock is currently
empty and it will sell off homes surplus to requirements.
'Housing is not a core activity for the ministry of defence,' said Lord
Cranbourne. 'The trust will bring in private housing management skills as
well as giving access to private capital.'
Service personnel rents will continue to be set by the armed forces pay
review body. The ministry will top up the rents to levels comparable with
those charged by local authorities and housing associations.
The form of the new trust has yet to be decided, the minister added. The
options include an industrial and provident society, a chartered corporation
or a company limited by guarantee.

FT  24 MAR 94 / MPs seek reform of university spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sloppy purchasing procedures cost the 'old' universities in England at least
Pounds 30m per year, the cross-party Commons public accounts committee says
in a report issued yesterday.
It recommends reforms to universities' financial management, and calls on
the Higher Education Funding Council for England, an education department
quango, to take the lead in ensuring the savings were made. The figure
excludes 'new' universities recently converted from polytechnics.
The report says: 'We note the acceptance by the higher education sector that
savings of at least 5 per cent are achievable from improved purchasing
practices, equivalent to over Pounds 30m each year for the old universities
sector in England alone.'
It found that large numbers of staff had purchasing responsibilities, and
that 'in some universities there were lapses in the fundamental requirement
that an invoice should be authorised for payment by a different person to
that raising the related purchasing order'.
The committee recommends publishing comparisons on prices paid for a
'substantial basket of goods'. Research shows that could have saved 5 per
cent if they all bought 27 commonly used items at their average price.
Professor Graeme Davies, chief executive of the funding council, welcomed
the report. He said it would allow further progress to be made, but he added
that universities had achieved savings of Pounds 1.7bn since 1988-89 by
'expanding their student numbers without a proportionate increase in public
funding'.

FT  24 MAR 94 / Short Lautro test that 'a monkey could pass': How sales
staff are trained
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ms Gillian Hurley spent what she regards as 'the worst time of her life'
selling personal pensions and other life products.
She worked for Henley Financial Associates, a London-based company which
sells insurance on behalf of Lincoln National, a big US investment products
group.
Ms Hurley joined Henley in 1991 aged 20. After four weeks' sales training,
she travelled around south-east England by train and taxi selling investment
plans and pension products to doctors.
She left disillusioned after less than a year. Her earnings, worked out on a
commission basis, totalled no more than about Pounds 2,000.
Ms Hurley, who now works for a City investment group, says she never
knowingly gave misleading advice to clients but says that she never knew
enough about the products she was selling - and crucially their possible
disadvantages compared with other insurance products - to give best advice.
Yet she managed to satisfy the training standards laid down by Lautro, the
insurance industry watchdog, which were meant to ensure that people buying
pensions and related products got a good deal.
Because her salary was linked to sales Ms Hurley was under pressure to sell
as many products as she could. 'I learnt to bluff my way through many
situations where clients asked too many technical questions - dangerous
considering I was toying with the financial future of many people,' she
said.
'The product training I received was atrocious. (To satisfy the Lautro
requirement) I had to take a half-an-hour test that a monkey could have
passed.'
Critics of the life insurance industry say the high rate of turnover of
sales staff, with poor training standards and the emphasis on commission,
can often lead to consumers being sold inappropriate products.
According to industry estimates about half the 150,000 sales people in the
industry have been in their jobs for less than two years. Many believe their
training is inadequate given the complexity of the products they are
selling.
Mr Joel Joffe, former deputy chairman of insurance company Allied Dunbar and
an advocate of higher consumer standards, said: 'The industry has in recent
years increased the competence of its sales staff, but more needs to be
done.'
Ms Janet Trimmer, who left the industry last year after 10 years as an
insurance consultant, said: 'Companies will take on just about anyone as
long as they don't have a criminal record.'
The industry can point to many sales staff who are happy with their
conditions of employment and believe they do a valuable job, but it is not
difficult to find other people with experiences similar to those of Ms
Hurley.
Mr Simon Evans, who worked for Henley for 18 months in the early 1990s and
is now an independent financial adviser, said that the product training at
Henley failed to cover what was available in the industry. As a result the
products he was selling 'may not necessarily have been the best ones' to
suit particular customers.
Ms Margaret Kinlay, head of sales at Henley, which employs 50 staff in three
offices around Britain, said she was 'sorry and surprised' to hear the
complaints about training standards.
She said: 'In the past Lautro has told us we were well ahead of what is
required.'
Mr Derek Rogers, marketing director at the UK subsidiary of Lincoln
National, said his company insisted on rigorous training standards. Henley
had a very good training record.
Another person with a less than glowing tale of his experiences in the
industry is Mr Richard Butler, who worked for two months from December 1990
at the Southend on Sea, Essex, office of the Laurentian Milldon insurance
group.
On the dole at the time, Mr Butler, aged 23, answered an advertisement in
his local paper calling for sales staff. He said his four weeks of training
emphasised not the products but sales procedures.
'You had to say to the customer: 'You know it makes sense.' If they nodded
their heads or said 'yes' you were on the way to making a sale. I had to
pass a test to meet the Lautro standards, but it was dead easy. You were
asked a set of questions 10 minutes after having been told what the answers
were.'
After earning Pounds 1,400 selling three investment plans, Mr Butler left
Laurentian having realised that the insurance business was not for him.
Laurentian said all its 450 sales staff received 'intensive training' and
that had Mr Butler stayed with the company he would have been put through
more rigorous training procedures to increase his knowledge of the industry.

FT  24 MAR 94 / Satellite row causes Brussels legal action
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK appears to be heading for another row with Brussels following a
decision yesterday by the European Commission to start legal action against
the British government for failure to comply with a television directive.
The row is about whether the UK is too lax in licensing satellite television
channels which can be shown all over the European Union.
The commission is taking the UK to the European Court of Justice over the
technical issue of jurisdiction. All other EU countries regulate satellite
channels in the country where their headquarters are located.
The UK, following the European Council convention on the issue, believes
jurisdiction should be in the country where the programme signal is
'up-linked' to the satellite.
The jurisdiction issue masks the real dispute which is about quotas to
preserve European programme content.
Under the directive, cable and satellite television channels have to carry a
majority of European-made programmes 'where practicable'. Channels which do
not are expected to move progressively in that direction.
Channels such as Mr Ted Turner's TNT/Cartoon channel, licensed in the UK,
feature mostly American material.
The commission is believed to have decided to move against the UK on the
jurisdiction issue because it might not be successful on quotas regarding
the 'where practicable' qualification. A new green paper on audio-visual
industries throughout the EU is believed to suggest strengthening the quota
system, possibly requiring evidence of direct investment in European
programming.
Yesterday's decision means the commission has decided to try to force the UK
to come into line with the rest of Europe.
The move is likely to be welcomed by France and Belgium, which have
complained that the UK's failure to impose EU standards on satellite
television has left TNT/Cartoon free to broadcast into their markets.
The present situation, the commission argues, makes a mockery of the single
market, since broadcasters can fall under two national licensing systems -
or under none, as in the recent case of the pornographic channel Red Hot
Dutch, which evaded both UK and Dutch licensing laws.
In December the National Heritage Department in the UK wrote to a number of
satellite channels asking what progress they had made in meeting the 51 per
cent programme quota.

FT  24 MAR 94 / Political Notebook: 'Bash-a-Kraut' school of politics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Baroness Thatcher raged about Europe, it was invariably a sign of
weakness. The argument was running against her and she needed an outlet for
her frustration.
Nothing has changed. Mr John Major's newly-discovered Gaullism is a
synthetic affair. He has chosen to fight Britain's partners over voting
rights in an enlarged European Union because his position is weak, not
because it is strong.
That was the judgment of the Tory Euro-sceptics who applauded his tirade
this week against Brussels and of the enthusiasts for Europe who warned that
the party may be on the verge of another civil war.
Mr Major has decided he needs the support of the Tory right - the group he
courted then abandoned when they had secured his succession to No 10 - if he
is to survive the summer.
The parallels with last autumn are unmistakable. Then Mr Major launched his
ill-fated back-to-basics initiative in order to rebuild bridges with his
ideological enemies.
Now the prime minister who promised to put Britain at the heart of Europe is
picking a fight with the nation's continental partners. The European
elections in June will be fought on a nationalist platform. One rightwing
minister suggested 'Britain for the British' as an appropriate campaign
slogan.
Mr Major appears genuinely determined not to give way over the size of the
blocking minority. He has no qualms about relying on socialist Spain as his
only ally.
Mr Douglas Hurd, whose public manner suggests that he finds the prime
minister's rhetoric distasteful, cannot now accept any formula which looks
like a retreat.
Mr Major claims the bulk of his party is behind him. It is certainly true
that opinion on the back benches has hardened since the stand was taken on
defending the misnamed 'British veto'.
Demoralised Tory MPs see in the battle with Johnny Foreigner a chance of
easy headlines. They are encouraged that a leader more typically swept along
by events is ready for once to back up tough words with tough action.
Many Conservatives swallowed the rhetoric used by Messrs Major and Hurd to
sell them the Maastricht Treaty. That accord, they were told, marked the end
of the road for Europe's centralists. The nation state would return
centre-stage.
Mr Hurd, who once more accurately described the treaty as 'an honourable
draw', never believed his own propaganda. But it is now too late for the
foreign secretary to admit that.
The long-sought entry to the European Union of Sweden, Norway, Finland and
Austria cannot therefore be seen to dilute the government's power to block
unpalatable decisions. There is a similar mood among Tory party activists,
many of whom are said by pro-European MPs to belong to the
When-in-doubt-bash-a-Kraut school of politics.
Then there is the cabinet. It has a large pro-European majority. Mr Michael
Heseltine may have given a Euro-sceptic edge to his recent public
pronouncements, but within government he has continued to argue the European
case on almost every issue of substance.
The combative Mr Kenneth Clarke likes picking fights with Brussels - just as
he used to do with local authorities and trade unions - but his fundamental
commitment is not in doubt.
On this issue though both Mr Clarke and Mr Heseltine appear ready to see Mr
Major fight to the end. It is no accident that they would lead the betting
for the succession in any leadership crisis later in the year.
What is less certain is how the pro-Europeans will respond if Mr Major steps
over the brink. If enlargement of the Union is seriously delayed. The
enthusiasts on the back benches have so far allowed the sceptics to make the
running. Now they are threatening to resume hostilities.
There might be a happier ending to the present row. Mr Hurd is working hard
on a number of possible compromises which would preserve the substance of
the British suggestion.
Much work is being done on a proposal which would hold the blocking minority
to 23 votes for contentious social issues while increasing it to 27 for less
controversial directives. Mr Major would offer such a deal as a guarantee
that Britain's opt-out from the Maastricht social chapter could not be
circumvented.
The Tory back benches would cheer him for a day or two. The election posters
would declare that here was a leader who battled for Britain.
But Mr Major would not win respect. He is by instinct a Tory of the
centre-left. He is a pro-European. Many of his natural supporters are now
ready to desert him in any leadership crisis. If it comes to that he will
find no refuge with his new-found friends on the right.

FT  24 MAR 94 / Pension alarm brings a subdued response
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the storm over mis-selling of personal pensions to people transferring
out of occupational schemes broke last December the Securities and
Investments Board, the City's chief regulator, took the lead in urging
investors not to panic.
Mr Andrew Large, SIB chairman, insisted that those who bought private
pension plans need take no urgent action.
Many in the life industry muttered that it was SIB itself, by its handling
of the pilot study showing widespread non-compliance with regulators'
standards, that had increased the prospect of a panic by investors. Three
months on, however, although several cases have received great publicity,
there is little evidence of widespread customer unease in respect of the
estimated 500,000 pension transfers.
Mr David Linnell, compliance officer of Prudential, the UK's largest life
company, said that advertisements placed since last December attracted only
about 230 responses.
He said that perhaps as many again came in to Prudential through other
channels.
TSB Life took an even more pro-active stance in its efforts to reassure. It
wrote to all 44,000 of its pension transfer customers, receiving 1,400
letters and calls in reply seeking further information.
Allied Dunbar, the financial services subsidiary of BAT, which is estimated
to have about 50,000 pension transfers, said it had received about 150
queries. Even the high profile taken by SIB has attracted only a few hundred
letters.
In spite of the best efforts of the life industry the rarity of customer
responses cannot be attributed entirely to high levels of satisfaction and
confidence in the advice given.
Legal &amp; General, which is estimated to have a similar number of cases, said
it had received only a few queries. It suggested this might be because
people who took out personal pensions were likely to feel more confident of
their pension - even now - than if they had not made their own arrangements.
Other theories are more ominous.
Allied Dunbar said that many people might be waiting for the SIB report on
compensation to be published in the summer, as Mr Large suggested, and that
the number of inquiries would rise after that.
Also less positive is the suggestion that people may have turned for advice
to the occupational schemes they left rather than to the agents through whom
they transferred.
But perhaps most important, and admitted by the life industry to be a factor
in the sales process, is people's reluctance to consider their future
financial position, especially if they are some way off retirement.
The life industry is taking comfort from the absence of reaction. In the
end, however, compensation will have to be paid to all who have suffered
from following poor advice - whether they realise this or not - and it will
be up to the industry to ensure that this happens.

FT  24 MAR 94 / Debt trading reform rejected in Bank U-turn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bank of England yesterday 'firmly rejected' its own controversial
suggestion that lenders be prohibited from trading the debt of companies
while a financial restructuring is taking place.
The Bank, after discussions with British bankers, has decided that even a
formal code of practice governing sales of distressed company debt is
unwise.
The Bank has been concerned that the ability of creditors to sell loans in
the secondary market - and the ability of other investors to buy them -
could disrupt efforts to find arrangements which would allow a viable
company to continue trading. It has asked banks to try to secureco-operation
between a troubled company and all its lenders.
Mr Pen Kent, executive director at the Bank of England, said at a conference
on distressed debt: 'One of the ideas initially mooted by myself in earlier
speeches was the idea of a closed season on trading to avoid disruption at
sensitive times. After a fairly wide discussion among a range of banks, both
British and foreign, this has now been firmly rejected.'
Mr Kent said, however, that banks remained free to agree among themselves to
restrict trading during sensitive periods, either when they were drawing up
loan documentation or when a borrower's difficulties became apparent.
Mr Kent also said that after considerable discussion the Bank had decided
against formally codifying best practice for those trading distressed
corporate debt.
Instead, Mr Kent said, the Bank was outlining the spirit of the 'London
approach' - co-operation between banks and lenders - and asking debt traders
to honour it. Specifically, debt trading should occur in a 'positive and
constructive spirit', potential investors should be informed of the London
approach before buying debt and institutions should inform fellow lenders
when they intend to sell debt.
Also, the Bank wants further discussions relating to such matters as inside
information. It wants clarification on how much about a company's affairs
can be revealed to potential investors by existing lenders.
Debt traders welcomed the statement. Mr Peter Young, head of loan trading at
Continental Bank said: 'The Bank has probably come to the view that trading
in distressed debt is valuable for the market and actually helps liquidity.'

The government's spending watchdog is to be asked to investigate allegations
that the Department for Education has 'misused' public funds in advertising
its policies.
Mr Robert Sheldon, Labour chairman of the Commons' public accounts
committee, said he would ask the National Audit Office to investigate
spending on publicity at the department following a complaint from Mrs Ann
Taylor, shadow education secretary.
Mrs Taylor says the department's annual expenditure on advertising has risen
from Pounds 103,800 in 1979-80 to Pounds 8.9m in 1991-92.

give a higher priority to possible manslaughter prosecutions in cases where
workers are killed in the workplace.
In a report today, a health and safety pressure group highlights 28
workplace deaths in which it claims that insufficient investigation was
carried out by inspectors.
The report, by the West Midlands Health and Safety Advice Centre, an
advisory organisation funded by local authorities, criticises the HSE for
failing to bring more prosecutions.
The HSE said last night that prosecutions for manslaughter in this area
rarely succeeded and decisions to proceed were a matter for the Crown
Prosecution Service.

FT  24 MAR 94 / Labour 'would take back coal pits'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The next Labour government would renationalise coal mines if that was what
mineworkers wanted, Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, told
the Commons last night, Ivor Owen writes.
Responding to a challenge from Mr Patrick McLoughlin, a junior minister, Mr
Cook said he would be 'astonished' if Labour's plans for rescuing the coal
industry did not involve public ownership.
Mr Dennis Skinner, leftwing Labour MP for Bolsover who is sponsored by the
National Union of Mineworkers, described this as 'a big improvement'.
A Labour attempt to prevent the closure of any more pits before the
establishment of the new Coal Authority provided for by the coal industry
bill was defeated by 31.

FT  24 MAR 94 / Dividend warning for MCC creditors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Creditors of Maxwell Communication Corporation who expected their first
dividend payout this month may have to wait until the end of the year.
Mr Mark Homan, partner at Price Waterhouse and joint administrator for MCC,
has written to creditors saying that difficulties in resolving claims on
pension schemes formally controlled by Robert Maxwell are causing the delay.
In a report to creditors on January 27 Price Waterhouse had said that it
hoped to make a first distribution to creditors in March - provided certain
issues could be resolved.
The pension scheme managers are seeking a proprietary claim over MCC assets
which, they say, were partly acquired with assets stolen from the funds.
But in December Mr Justice Vinelott ruled that Price Waterhouse could not
make a distribution to creditors until the pension fund claims were
resolved, while rejecting a claim from some pension schemes for a
proprietary charge on all MCC assets.
In his letter - dated March 18 - Mr Homan notes that a series of legal
decisions and possible appeals will have to be heard before the matter can
be straightened out.
He said: 'On the basis of court rulings to date the administrators have no
reason at this stage to change the estimated dividend percentage calculated
in Appendix 1 to the report.
'However, the estimated dividend and the timing of distributions could be
affected by future decisions of the courts.
'It is possible that if the legal process becomes further protracted no
dividend will be payable until the end of 1994.'
Traders in distressed corporate debt estimate that about half the creditors
to MCC purchased loans at deep discounts to face value in the secondary
markets.
Traders said that in recent days they had seen several blocks of MCC debt
offered at between 33p and 35p in the pound, down sharply from the peak of
45p a year ago.

Mr John Redwood has asked the National Health Service in Wales to switch
Pounds 12.5m a year from management and administrative costs to patient
care.
The Welsh secretary, who has previously criticised the number of 'grey

FT  24 MAR 94 / Three unions 'live beyond means'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Three unions are living substantially beyond their means and one has
virtually no assets, according to the latest published accounts in the 1993
report of the certification officer for Trade Unions and Employer
Organisations.
The three were Ucatt, the construction union, the RMT transport and rail
union, and the GPMU print union.
Ucatt had total expenditure of Pounds 7.4m and income of Pounds 5.4m but net
assets of only about Pounds 400,000. The RMT had expenditure of Pounds 13.7m
and income of Pounds 10.5m but a healthier asset base of Pounds 15.3m.
The GPMU had the biggest shortfall between spending of Pounds 35.5m and
income of Pounds 29.4m but recorded one of the biggest asset bases of any
trade union at just over Pounds 72m.

FT  24 MAR 94 / Swan Hunter rescue still in balance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The prospects of Swan Hunter, the Tyneside shipbuilder in receivership,
finding a buyer were still in the balance last night after a day of
intensive negotiations between French-owned Constructions Mecaniques de
Normandie and Swan Hunter receivers Price Waterhouse.
CMN had hoped to bid for Swan Hunter before today's Ministry of Defence
deadline for submission of tenders for the refit of the landing ship Sir
Bedivere. However no bid was made yesterday.
Joint receiver Mr Gordon Horsfield said last night that he was hopeful of
seeing a sale within the next few days, although any agreement with CMN was
likely to be conditional on winning the refit.
Price Waterhouse said it would today submit to the MoD its tender for the
refit. It described the contract as critical to the yard's survival.
For the tender to have any chance of success, it must be underwritten by a
prospective buyer for Swan Hunter. To maintain the bid's credibility the
underwriting needs to take place within a matter of days.
Price Waterhouse did not rule out the possibility of another bidder coming
forward.
Mr Fred Henderson, leader of the CMN bid team, said: 'Our interest is in
buying Swan Hunter as a viable, continuing business, although some
negotiation has still to be done.' He confirmed that any offer would be
conditional on winning the Sir Bedivere tender.
The importance of a bid from CMN - the only company to say publicly that it
wants to buy the yard - was heightened yesterday by news from
Southampton-based shipbuilder Vosper Thornycroft that it felt there were
'insufficient grounds' for it to make an offer at this stage. It said it
would keep the position under review.
Earlier this week CMN insisted that it must have categorical government
assurances that if it bought Swan Hunter it would be treated equally with
other, UK-owned, shipyards in the fight for future MoD contracts.
The MoD said it had given general assurances and added that a specific
letter to CMN might be sent 'in the very near future'.

FT  24 MAR 94 / Rover Maestro will live on in Bulgaria
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VIRGINIA MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rover intends to start assembling Maestro cars and vans in Bulgaria by the
end of the year after production of the 11-year-old range has ceased in
Britain.
Maestro assembly line equipment will be shipped from Rover's plant at
Cowley, Oxford to a plant at Varna on the Black Sea. The company, a
subsidiary of BMW of Germany, said last night that the Maestro would be
assembled in Bulgaria from Cowley-supplied CKD - completely knocked down -
kits.
Rover said that it expected to set up a joint-venture company with Bulgarian
banks and other local partners within six months.
The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development has been approached to
participate in the project which has been under negotiation for several
years.
Rover plans to produce up to 10,000 Maestros a year in Bulgaria with a
significant share of the output being exported to other east European
markets.
Rover is expected to take a significant minority stake in the joint venture,
which would be secured through the provision of the car and the transfer of
technology. It would not make any financial contribution, the company said
last night.
Both car and van ranges would be equipped with the two-litre diesel engine
currently fitted in the UK Maestro and Montego ranges.
A 12-strong Rover team is in Bulgaria investigating the Varna plant - where
the Maestro will be assembled. 'We are going to strip out the plant and
re-fit it,' the company said last night.
The Bulgarian project is the most advanced of several foreign ventures that
have been under consideration by Rover.
The UK carmaker is also involved in negotiations which could lead eventually
to the Montego being assembled in India. The large family car was launched
in the UK in 1984 and is still assembled in small volumes at the Cowley
plant.
Last year Rover signed a memorandum of understanding with the Sipani group
in India which could lead to a joint venture for the local assembly of the
Montego and Rover's two-litre turbo-diesel engine.
The group also signed a memorandum of understanding with the Indonesian
government last year to lead the development of a national car project to
design, develop and manufacture a small car for production in Indonesia.

FT  24 MAR 94 / Rail union warns of wide disruption
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A summer of widespread disruption on the railways over the move to
privatisation was threatened yesterday by Mr Jimmy Knapp, general secretary
of the RMT rail union.
He said that his union was in potential conflict with British Rail on five
issues that could bring one-day strikes, overtime bans and work-to-rules. Mr
Knapp said: 'Trouble is going to break out if BR do not come to terms with
us. There is a genuine fear of the future among my members.'
On Tuesday the union's members at BR will receive ballot papers for a strike
ballot over the issue of job deployment between BR and the new publicly
owned body Railtrack that takes over maintenance of the track and signalling
on April 1.
The union wants a promotion, transfer and redundancy agreement to continue
covering staff who move to work for Railtrack so they can seek future jobs
in British Rail, something BR is refusing to accept. RMT also intends to
ballot its 5,000 signalling staff after the rejection by BR of an 11 per
cent interim pay demand for them in return for recent productivity
improvements. Their pay differential has narrowed and they want to restore
it.
Mr Knapp added that the union and BR have also failed to agree on the
security of new employment contracts that 30,000 track maintenance and
renewal workers will have after privatisation. He said the union was also on
a collision course with BR over the future of negotiating procedures with
the move to decentralised pay bargaining and the end of national
negotiations.
The RMT is insisting on a 'substantial' pay offer for all its members
working at BR when the present agreement ends on April 4. It has a
difference of view with BR over the transfer of staff pensions after
privatisation.
Unions representing 5.5m public-sector workers agreed yesterday to call a
day of action on a weekend in July and a week of demonstrations and other
protests in the autumn against the government's three-year pay bill freeze.

FT  24 MAR 94 / Advertisers go to work on the egg
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
From next Monday morning breakfasters will be able to read their boiled eggs
as well as their newspapers - British Telecommunications has taken
advertising space on 13.5m eggs to promote its new daytime phone charges.
BT said the eggs, which will bear the message 'Wake up to BT's new Daytime
Rate', were a 'cheap medium' enabling it to get over the message that peak
charges have been abolished.
European ministers failed to agree in September last year on whether
advertising on eggs should be allowed - but gave the go-ahead for a two-year
trial.
Holmes &amp; Marchant Blitz, the advertising agency which is producing the egg
campaign for BT, said it was the first large-scale promotion using
advertisements on eggs in Europe. It believed egg advertising had been tried
in Israel.
The advertisements are printed using a high-pressure jet which blows dots of
food colouring on each shell.
More than 20 packaging stations have been equipped to print the patented
'eggverts'.
The eggs will be distributed through Tesco and Asda supermarkets in time for
Easter.

FT  24 MAR 94 / Television complaint by Fowler is rejected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Independent Television Commission yesterday rejected a complaint by Sir
Norman Fowler, Conservative party chairman, that a issue of Granada TV's
World in Action lacked due impartiality, Raymond Snoddy writes.
The programme took three Tory-voting families in the marginal Conservative
seat of Dover and gave estimates of how their tax bill was going to rise as
a result of government tax changes.
Mr David Glencross, the commission's chief executive, said in his letter to
Sir Norman: 'It is not our conclusion that the programme breached the 1990
Broadcasting Act nor the ITC programme code that derives from it.' He said
politicians did not have 'a right of veto' over the content of a programme
because they refused to appear in it.
The commission expressed reservations about a visual element of the
programme - an advertising van driving around Deal with a 'Tory Tax
Bombshell' image - but decided this did not amount to a breach of
impartiality rules.

FT  24 MAR 94 / PO heads accept idea of break-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Post Office is ready to accept the possible break-up of the corporation
by the government with the privatisation of its mail and parcels businesses,
keeping counter services in the public sector.
Post Office executives are also keen to see the counter services given
greater commercial freedom so that they can operate more competitively.
The option of breaking up the Post Office has not yet been discussed with
the corporation's executives, but Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and
industry secretary, may see it as a way out of the impasse on the Post
Office's future.
Keeping rural post offices in the public sector for the time being would
allay fears among government backbenchers, and break-up would enable the
Post Office to secure the commercial freedom it has been demanding for the
mail and parcel businesses.
The influential House of Commons trade and industry committee is expected to
endorse today the Post Office's demand for commercial freedom to raise
finance on the money markets and escape from tight Treasury financial
control.
MPs from all parties appear to have accepted the Post Office's argument that
its activities are being hindered by its continuing lack of commercial
freedom.
It is more than 20 months since Mr Heseltine launched a review into the
future ownership of the Post Office. Last month he told the committee that
he was opposed to giving the Post Office commercial freedom in the public
sector, and did not favour maintaining the corporation in its present form.
The corporation told the committee there was 'a sense of approaching crisis'
because the long delay over making a decision on its future had meant a cut
in its investment programme.
Mr Heseltine may not make an announcement about the Post Office until after
the local government elections in May, or even the European elections in
June, but it could come as early as just after Easter.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The stalemate in efforts to embrace the republican movement in the Northern
Ireland peace process was underlined yesterday by Mr Martin McGuinness, a
senior member of Sinn Fein, who ruled out progress without face-to-face
talks involving the British government, Michael Cassell in Belfast and David
Owen write.
Mr McGuinness claimed the British government was seeking surrender by the
IRA and trying to break the republican movement 'once and for all'.
He said on BBC Radio Ulster that direct talks might move the peace process
forward 'quite dramatically'.
Mr McGuinness stressed that Sinn Fein was not calling for negotiations with
British ministers but wanted talks aimed at clarifying the contents of the
Downing Street declaration.
At Westminster, the creation of a Northern Ireland select committee edged a
step closer after a cross-party committee of MPs reached agreement on the
new body's party political composition.
It is likely to start work soon after Easter.

FT  24 MAR 94 / Job creation rate disappoints government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is disappointed with the rate of increase in employment in
the UK, a confidential cabinet briefing note prepared by the Department of
Employment shows.
The document, written by Mr David Fenwick. the department's deputy head of
statistics, for Mr David Hunt, employment secretary, says that the rate of
increase is 'less than we had hoped'. The document gives no indication of
what figure the government had been expecting.
It notes that 'much of the growth is among the self-employed and part
timers'. Only one in five leaving the unemployment claimant total go to a
full-time job and two out of five into part-time work.
The document warns that critics may 'concentrate on some particular groups
and present a 'bad' employment picture . . .I would suggest a robust
approach to counter this'.
Mr Fenwick says Mr Hunt and his cabinet colleagues ought to stress that
'part-time jobs are not all low paid and they are popular. Only 14 per cent
say they worked part time because no full-time job was available. To dismiss
such jobs is an insult to an important part of the workforce'.
He argues that the most favourable feature of the labour market is that
fewer people are losing their jobs. He points out that 325,000 people joined
the count in February, the lowest figure since October 1990, while
redundancy figures were 250,000 for the September-November period of last
year, compared with 310,000 for the same period of 1992. Mr Fenwick says a
continuing fall in unemployment would reduce the fear of unemployment 'with
possible beneficial effects on confidence'.
He suggests that Mr Hunt should encourage his cabinet colleagues to be
'bullish on the labour market' and take every opportunity to expose the
'false accusations about our unemployment figures' from Mr John Prescott,
shadow employment secretary.
Mr Prescott said the document indicated that there were 'still forces in the
government more concerned with manipulating the unemployment figures than
making an honest recording of those out of work'.

FT  24 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Clinton backs law to combat ship subsidies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Clinton administration has agreed to throw its weight behind legislation
now in Congress which would impose fines on new ships built in foreign
subsidised shipyards entering US ports.
The decision to back the long-delayed legislation comes after leading
shipbuilding countries and the US, meeting last week at the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development in Paris, failed to agree to an end to
shipbuilding and repair subsidies. The bill is intended to serve as a
leverage in the US effort to end ship dumping, indirect supports, and
subsidised export credits.
US trade officials and the industry, represented by the Shipbuilders Council
of America, are now at odds over the future of the talks. Officials are
hoping for another round in April. The Swedish chairman of the talks will
prepare a document laying the groundwork for further negotiations.
Mr John Stocker, president of the shipbuilders council, said he had lost
hope in a negotiated solution.
Unsubsidised US shipyards lost their commercial business base during the
1980s because they could not compete against subsidised competition. With
the end of the cold war and the reduction of the naval fleet, more shipyards
will close.
Mr Stocker was critical of European negotiators, who are blaming the failure
of the talks on the US. 'While the Japanese and Koreans were clearly
interested, at least, in engaging the US side in dialogue, Europe was not,'
he said. 'Without the legislation, we will never attain the trade agreement
we want.' The council is also critical of the administration, which has
reportedly held up 11 applications for a new programme of export credit
guarantees, which offer up to 25-year repayment terms.
After bilateral talks with Japan and South Korea produced significant
breakthroughs, US trade officials thought an end to the negotiations was at
last in sight.
'The US, Japan and Korea agreed to one standard on loan repayment terms - 12
years. Europe said No,' an official said. 'The US wanted discipline and a
binding dispute settlement on export credit financing. The EU said No.'

<TEXT>
Japan's ministry of health and welfare yesterday warned that alpha
interferons, drugs developed to treat hepatitis and cancer, could cause
depression and exacerbate suicidal tendencies. It said 32 people taking the
drug between July 1987 and December 1993 had attempted suicide and 12 of
them had died.
The announcement is another serious blow for the Japanese pharmaceutical
industry. Interferons were one of fastest growing sectors last year in what
was otherwise a lacklustre Japanese drugs market.
The stocks of Japanese companies marketing alpha interferons fell sharply.
Takeda shares fell Y40 to Y1,250. Baring Securities estimates its interferon
generated sales of Y30bn (Pounds 190m) last year.
Sumitomo Chemical, which markets interferon under licence from Wellcome of
the UK and achieved sales of about Y48bn, fell Y11 to Y464. Yamanouchi
shares dropped Y20 to Y2,050.
The news is also a setback for foreign drug companies. The world alpha
interferon market was worth about Dollars 1.5bn last year, of which most was
in Japan. Those affected include Schering-Plough of the US, whose drug
achieved sales in Japan of Y30bn last year.

<TEXT>
Ford, the US vehicle-maker, has reached outline agreement with Shanghai
Automotive Industry Corporation (SAIC) to set up a components joint venture
in China.
It would be Ford's first manufacturing venture in China, and the company
said it hoped to go ahead 'as soon as possible'.
The two companies expect to finalise the deal 'in a few weeks'. It will then
be submitted to the authorities for final approval.
The collaboration between Ford's plastic and trim products division and
SAIC's Yan Feng division is aimed at producing a range of components
including interior trim, seats, instrument panels and other plastic parts
for the Chinese motor industry.
Ford said that Yan Feng was currently the largest supplier of automotive
trim components in China.
The US company is also having discussions with several other Chinese
manufacturers that could lead to components joint ventures in areas such as
glass, electronics, engine management systems and air conditioning. It said
it was also interested in vehicle assembly opportunities in China.

FT  24 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Brittan wants rights put on WTO agenda
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   LONDON, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Leon Brittan, the European trade commissioner, called yesterday for
workers' rights to be placed on the agenda of the planned World Trade
Organisation, successor to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
The European Union should propose this formally at next month's Gatt
ministerial meeting in Marrakesh, he said. However, he strongly opposed any
action against 'social dumping' when exporters owed their advantage purely
to low wage and social costs.
Sir Leon's statement, which was broadly endorsed by fellow commissioners,
follows US demands that human and social rights be made a WTO priority. It
coincided with an apparent softening in the position of France, which has
favoured vigorous international measures to combat 'social dumping'.
The French government said yesterday that countries should not be allowed to
gain undue advantage from lax labour and environmental standards. However,
it recognised low-wage competition as 'a fact of international trade' and
said environmental safeguards should not be used as a pretext for trade
protection.
French officials said that, by avoiding any proposal to discriminate against
exporters purely on cost grounds, they were more likely to win support from
other industrialised countries for a serious debate in the WTO on labour and
environmental standards.
Sir Leon's remarks were noticeably more positive than his earlier stance,
which appeared cool to US proposals for an early debate on workers' rights
in the WTO. But he told the Commission yesterday that if the EU held back,
other Gatt members were likely to go ahead.
He said a WTO debate should focus on actions to curb exports produced by
forced labour, such as slavery and child exploitation, and on securing the
right of free organisation. He suggested standards could be geared to
countries' level of economic development.
Though he expected no decisions of substance to be taken on the issue in
Marrakesh, his statement is unlikely to be welcomed by Mr Peter Sutherland,
Gatt director-general, who is reluctant to see workers' rights placed high
on the WTO agenda.
Sir Leon said there was 'no chance whatsoever of achieving any international
consensus in favour of permitting trade action to be used against countries
which do no more than benefit from lower wage or social security costs'.
Such measures would also do little to relieve EU unemployment.
However, he said the EU could consider laws to prohibit imports produced by
prison labour, though they could be hard to enforce. It should also examine
ways to monitor and enforce more effectively compliance with conventions
adopted in the International Labour Organisation.

The US, long complaining about the injury done to domestic businesses from
foreign subsidies, hands out its own research and development subsidies -
civilian and military - 'at a greater rate than any country in the world'.
So says Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, who yesterday was on
Capitol Hill defending the subsidies limitations agreed in the Uruguay
Round. 'The greatest growth of those subsidies came under the Reagan and
Bush administrations, working with private industry,' he said.
He added the US had agreed in the Round to raise the percentage allowable
for government subsidies for basic or applied research to protect US
programmes 'critical to our competitive success'.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US yesterday won a change in General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
rules allowing it to refuse Gatt benefits to China even if Beijing succeeds
in rejoining the world trade body this year.
US trade officials have indicated that Washington might seek this opt-out if
the Clinton administration decides in June not to renew China's most
favoured nation status in the US market because of Beijing's poor human
rights record. The MFN rule, which forbids discrimination between trading
partners, is one of Gatt's fundamental tenets.
At yesterday's meeting of Gatt's governing council, the US secured formal
approval from other nations for a reinterpretation of the 'non-application'
rule. This provision, rarely invoked, allows any individual Gatt member to
refuse to apply the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to an incoming
member (and vice versa).
However, the present rule stipulates that the two countries must not have
begun tariff negotiations with each other, an integral part of the
bargaining process on Gatt entry terms. The new interpretation, effective
immediately, will allow 'non-application' even after tariff negotiations
have been started. This effectively applies to Gatt the redrafted
'non-application' rule of the new World Trade Organisation, due to come into
force next year.
The change means that the US could lift its effective block on China's rapid
entry into Gatt, and begin the necessary bilateral tariff bargaining with
Beijing, without prejudice to this year's decision on MFN. China is anxious
to become a Gatt member by the end of the year in order to qualify as an
original member of the WTO.
At a meeting last week of Gatt's negotiating group on Chinese entry terms,
trading partners agreed to try to accelerate the seven-year-old talks but
the US has so far refused to commit itself to an early deadline.
The possibility of allowing China to join Gatt, while reserving the right of
'non-application', could help the US administration in its search for a
long-term way out of the damaging annual MFN debate over Chinese trade and
human rights. If the US decides not to invoke the 'non-application'
provision at the outset, or later revokes it, it cannot under WTO rules
reinstate it again.
Yesterday's council meeting also saw strong criticism of the US decision to
reinstate Super 301 provisions for unilateral trade action. In addition, the
council decided:
to set up a working party to draft membership terms for Estonia, which
brings the number of countries negotiating Gatt entry to 22;
to set up a working party to examine whether the North American Free Trade
Agreement is consistent with Gatt rules;
to postpone substantive discussion of a Gatt disputes panel report
condemning EU restrictions on imports of Latin American bananas.
Negotiations between the EU and the affected producers are continuing.
Separately, trade officials expressed confidence yesterday that all 81
Uruguay Round tariff schedules would be cleared by trading partners as final
and correct by tomorrow's deadline.

'Sri Lanka looks a much better bet for Indian business than Vietnam', said
Mr Jamshyd Godrej, president of the Confederation of Indian Industry,
summing up prospects for Indian trade and investment in Sri Lanka, Mervyn de
Silva writes from Colombo. Mr Godrej was the leader of a 15-member business
delegation visiting Sri Lanka.
Bilateral trade rose from Dollars 65m in 1989 to just over Dollars 300m
(Pounds 205.4m) in 1992 but remains heavily in India's favour. The 1993
figure is likely to exceed Dollars 350m, according to the local chamber of
commerce. 'The Indian authorities and big business seem to agree that Indian
investment in joint export ventures is the best answer to the widening trade
gap. We must try to attract the Indian giants,' said a spokesman for the
national chamber of industries.
Arvind Mills, a leading Indian textile manufacturer, will set up a Dollars
14m textile mill in the north Colombo free trade zone. Two other Indian
projects, an asbestos factory and a steel rolling mill, have also been given
ministry approval.

The value of the projects, together with the development and commissioning

FT  24 MAR 94 / World Trade News: 'Litany of disasters' for the
international drugs industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON and PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The past year has been the worst in recent memory for the international
drugs industry, the Financial Times World Pharmaceuticals Conference heard
yesterday.
Mr Henry Wendt, chairman of SmithKline Beecham, opened the meeting in London
by reciting a 'litany of disasters', including 'draconian' government
mandated price cuts and/or prescribing restrictions in Italy, Germany, Japan
and other countries.
'Apart from the Gatt agreement, which advances protection of intellectual
property rights, it's hard to think of any good news for the pharmaceutical
industry over the last year,' Mr Wendt said. 'So it's no surprise that sales
and earnings growth is slowing and that many (company) shares have declined
by 30 per cent.'
Much of the industry's nervousness is now focused on the Clinton
administration's proposed US healthcare reforms. 'I have no qualms in
predicting that, come hell or high Whitewater, healthcare legislation will
be signed into law in 1994,' said Mr Toby Moffett, a former congressman who
now runs Strategic Policy, a US health consultancy.
Mr Moffett forecast that the legislation would be a watered-down version of
the original Clinton proposals. But, he warned, 'the politicians will feel
strongly that they need some populist elements to this bill and that means
that slapping down the insurance and pharmaceutical industries will be a
prerequisite to passage'.
The drugs industry had so far 'not been as creative and certainly not as
effective as it could be in getting its message across.'
But Mrs Virginia Bottomley, UK health secretary, delivered a more reassuring
message to the industry in Britain. Delegates were relieved to hear that the
government 'still remains to be convinced' about the merits of compulsory
generic substitution - prescribing cheap unbranded drugs wherever possible.
Her junior colleague, Dr Brian Mawhinney, health minister, had alarmed the
industry last month when he said he wanted to discuss ways of extending
generic substitution with the British Medical Association.
The Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare was severely criticised for its
cost-cutting methods by Mr Kunio Takeda, president of Takeda Chemical
Industries, Japan's biggest pharmaceuticals company.
The policy of steep price cuts every two years had forced manufacturers to
launch only slightly modified compounds to cut the time and cost involved in
developing new drugs, Mr Takeda said. Such policies would, in the long run,
damage the industry.
'If pharmaceuticals companies were forced to sacrifice themselves (because
of) unfair measures to contain healthcare expenditure, in the long-run (the
policy) would backfire in terms of a deterioration in drug discovery
opportunities,' he said.
Mr Takeda also complained of the ministry's 'closed door' way of
decision-making. Consultation with the industry appeared to be a mere
formality, he said. The ministry is imposing an average 6.6 per cent price
reduction on April 1.
The complaints follow a letter earlier this month sent to the Japanese
ministry by the US Pharmaceutical Manufacturers' Association and the
European Business Council. It objected to the lack of transparency in the
ministry's decisions and argued that changes in policy had been implemented
too quickly.

FT  24 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Clinton backs law to combat ship subsidies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Clinton administration has agreed to throw its weight behind legislation
now in Congress which would impose fines on new ships built in foreign
subsidised shipyards entering US ports.
The decision to back the long-delayed legislation comes after leading
shipbuilding countries and the US, meeting last week at the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development in Paris, failed to agree to an end to
shipbuilding and repair subsidies. The bill is intended to serve as a
leverage in the US effort to end ship dumping, indirect supports, and
subsidised export credits.
US trade officials and the industry, represented by the Shipbuilders Council
of America, are now at odds over the future of the talks. Officials are
hoping for another round in April. The Swedish chairman of the talks will
prepare a document laying the groundwork for further negotiations.
Mr John Stocker, president of the shipbuilders council, said he had lost
hope in a negotiated solution.
'Before last week's talks, we were assured by the Clinton administration
that this round was it,' Mr Stocker said. 'If agreement couldn't be reached,
our negotiators were going to pull the plug. We believe this time, final
means final.'
The shipbuilders council pushed for the talks when in 1989 it filed a
complaint under Section 301 of US trade law. Unsubsidised US shipyards lost
their commercial business base during the 1980s because they could not
compete against subsidised competition. With the end of the cold war and the
reduction of the naval fleet, more shipyards will close.
Mr Stocker was critical of European negotiators, who are blaming the failure
of the talks on the US. 'While the Japanese and Koreans were clearly
interested, at least, in engaging the US side in dialogue, Europe was not,'
he said. 'Without the legislation, we will never attain the trade agreement
we want.'
The council is also critical of the administration, which has reportedly
held up 11 applications for a new programme of export credit guarantees,
which offer up to 25-year repayment terms.
After bilateral talks with Japan and South Korea produced significant
breakthroughs, US trade officials thought an end to the negotiations was at
last in sight.
'The US, Japan and Korea agreed to one standard on loan repayment terms - 12
years. Europe said No,' an official said. 'The US wanted discipline and a
binding dispute settlement on export credit financing. The EU said No.'
The EU then brought up the US Jones Act, which allows only US owned, built,
and crewed ships to make more than one stop at US ports. US negotiators said
this was an operating issue rather than a shipbuilding issue, but that the
US was willing to limit the number of new ships built under the act.

FT  24 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Neighbours line up at the door of Nafta -
Caribbean basin nations hope for help to ease the pain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Central American and Caribbean governments are awaiting with more than
passing interest an imminent US statement on measures to cushion the
economic dislocation which the region expects from the North American Free
Trade Agreement.
However, Washington's proposals, promised by Mr Alexander Watson, assistant
secretary of state for inter-American affairs, are likely to disappoint
Caribbean basin governments which have been seeking a comprehensive package
to allow free access to the US and Canadian markets. The US proposals could
also be 'at a cost' to the region, say some Caribbean officials.
Claiming that a more competitive Mexico, with free access to the US and
Canada, will capture markets which Caribbean basin countries have developed
under current trade agreements, the region has asked for 'parity' with
Mexico in exporting to Nafta signatories.
Some regional government officials and US legislators supportive of the
Caribbean's concerns - which include the possible diversion of investments
to Mexico - have now concluded that what would amount to a de facto
extension of Nafta is unlikely. They believe that the US administration
would not again willingly confront the coalition of opposition which fought
the implementing legislation last November.
The measures to be announced by the US are a result of discussions last year
between President Bill Clinton and leaders from the Caribbean and Central
America. Mr Clinton and his Mexican counterpart, Mr Carlos Salinas, assured
the Caribbean basin countries that they would not be adversely affected by
the implementation of Nafta, and that efforts would be made to protect their
markets in the US and Canada.
What the Caribbean basin countries want is quick action by legislators in
Washington, and then in Ottawa and Mexico City, to ratify proposals by some
US congressmen to put all the region's exports to the US and Canada on a par
with Mexico's.
The parity proposals are aimed at giving Caribbean basin countries an open
door to the Nafta market for three years. During this time they would have
the opportunity of negotiating their future trade relationship with the
Nafta signatories, with the option of seeking membership either as
individual states or as a group.
'President Clinton has said his administration will ensure that the benefits
of Nafta are felt by the Caribbean countries,' said Mr Manuel Esquivel,
prime minister of Belize. 'We are heartened by President Salinas' assurances
that it is not Mexico's intention to take investments away from the
Caribbean. But we remain apprehensive.'
There is yet no indication of what the US administration will propose for
the Caribbean basin. Mr Edwin Carrington, secretary-general of the Caribbean
Community (Caricom), said he expected parity to be given to 'only a few' of
the region's exports, including textiles.
'The parity issue, which is the first step we are seeking, is becoming a
case of limited benefits for a very great price,' he said. While willing to
give parity to a few products, the US wanted the Caribbean basin countries
to meet new conditions, including bilateral investment treaties,
intellectual property rights agreements, workers' rights and environmental
legislation, democracy, good governance and accountability, Mr Carrington
said.
'The costs of parity are much higher than we anticipated and any thoughts of
full membership of Nafta are as far down the road as they ever were.'
In presenting their case for parity, Caribbean leaders have argued that the
US and Canada will also be the losers if there is extensive economic
dislocation in the region caused by a loss of markets to Mexico. Mr P J
Patterson, Jamaica's prime minister, claimed that many jobs in the US
depended on trade flows between that country and the Caribbean region.
'Each Dollars 1bn of US exports to the region creates 20,000 new jobs in the
US,' he said. 'In the past 10 years US exports to the Caribbean basin have
doubled, making the region the tenth largest market for US exporters. As
Caribbean economies grow our ability to absorb US exports will also
increase.
'Currently 60 cents of every dollar earned by the Caribbean returns to the
US through the purchase of US goods, compared with only 10 cents for each
dollar spent by Asia. This is why we must pursue efforts to ensure that the
question of the granting of parity be given early and positive
consideration.'
Without improved access to the US and Canadian markets to counter Mexico's
benefits under Nafta, the Caribbean basin countries will have to continue
depending on their current trade preference agreements with the US and
Canada.
The benefits from these were diminishing, said Mr Carrington, as the
region's exports became less competitive and Mexican products enjoyed the
benefits of the market.
'The Nafta playing field will never be level for the region,' he said.
'Nobody is going to give us an even playing field, but we have to work to
make it less uneven.'

FT  24 MAR 94 / Markets seek clues to 'neutral' rates: What Greenspan may
mean by such an interest level
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is a question hovering like a dark cloud over financial markets. What
does Mr Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, mean when he talks of
a 'neutral' level of short-term interest rates?
The question is critical because Mr Greenspan has indicated publicly that he
intends to raise rates until they reach a neutral level consistent with
sustainable non-inflationary growth.
The problem is that the Fed has given no indication of what such a rate
would be.
Confusion about the meaning of neutrality partly explained the adverse
market reaction to the Fed's first tightening move - the quarter point
increase in short rates announced on February 4.
It was immediately clear that rates were still below a neutral level.
Markets therefore discounted further rate increases, causing a plunge in
bond prices and a rise in yields to nearly 7 per cent.
Tuesday's quarter point increase, taking short rates to 3.5 per cent, was
better received, presumably because it took rates closer to Mr Greenspan's
goal of neutrality. Bond prices surged and share prices advanced modestly,
rather than plunging as in early February.
Many analysts now expect the Fed to leave rates unchanged for a few months,
in the hope that markets will calm down. But because 3.5 per cent is almost
certainly not what Mr Greenspan regards as a neutral monetary policy,
nagging doubts will remain.
In recent decades, says Mr Bruce Steinberg, a senior economist at Merrill
Lynch in New York, the federal funds rate - the cost of overnight money for
banks - has exceeded consumer price inflation by an average of 180 basis
points, or 1.8 percentage points.
Since the underlying rate of inflation is at least 2.5 per cent, and quite
possibly 3, this implies a neutral rate would be between 4 and 5 per cent.
However, during periods when inflation was subdued - such as the 1950s  -
the gap between inflation and short-term rates was closer to 100 basis
points or 1 percentage point. So optimists on inflation - such as President
Bill Clinton's economic advisers - may believe the present Fed funds rate of
3.5 per cent is already at, or close to, neutrality.
If economic growth slows down after overheating in the final quarter of last
year, as most forecasts suggest, monetary policy might not need to be
tightened much more. And bond yields could move back down to, say, 6.5 per
cent.
Mr Greenspan may have more sympathy for this view than some analysts
suspect. On several occasions he has noted that rapid economic growth need
not be inflationary provided it reflects rapid productivity growth  - which
the US has certainly enjoyed in the past two years.
It is thus conceivable that the Fed regards 4 per cent as an upper bound
rather than a lower bound when estimating neutrality.
But this hardly lets bond investors off the hook. The Fed's talk of raising
rates to neutral levels was probably only the first step in a gradual
process of conditioning political leaders to the need for a tighter monetary
policy.
In a strong business cycle upswing, such as that under way in the US today,
rates typically have to be lifted, temporarily, well above neutral levels.
It thus seems almost inevitable that the Fed will push rates well above 4
per cent even if it remains confident about the inflation outlook.
For what it is worth, historical experience suggests rates will rise
substantially from present levels.
The average increase in short rates during previous episodes of tightening
was nearly 6 percentage points, or nearly 4 percentage points excluding the
inflationary 1970s. That suggests short rates could rise to 7 per cent or
more in the next few years.
How rapidly the Fed raises rates will depend on trends in real growth and
inflation, which in turn will be influenced by the tightening already
announced.
The sharp rise in bond yields since early February has already caused
fixed-rate mortgage rates to rise from 7 per cent to 7.75 per cent. Since
these rates are fixed over the term of the mortgage, home-buyers are
scrambling to complete purchases before rates rise another notch. But over
the next few months, higher mortgage rates are likely to cool the housing
market.
Some deceleration in the heady growth of business investment - the leading
sector in this productivity-driven recovery - can also be expected in
response to the increase in long bond yields. But the impact will be modest
and will probably not begin to take effect much before the end of this year.
Fed tightening will also raise the cost of money for many consumers and
small businesses who borrow at rates linked to banks' prime lending rates.
Yesterday, several US banks, including Chemical Bank in New York, announced
a quarter point increase in prime rates to 6.25 per cent. However, the
margin between prime rates and money market rates remains generous by
historical standards. Since banks are highly profitable, any increase in
prime rates may lag behind increases in the Fed funds rate.
Opponents of further Fed tightening will argue not only that recent interest
rate moves are already having a negative impact on growth, but that prices
are anyway remarkably subdued. In February the annual rate of consumer price
inflation was 2.5 per cent; wholesale price inflation was under 1 per cent.
Mr Greenspan's unpopular task is to prevent a resurgence of inflation as the
recovery matures - something that has accompanied every previous post-war
business cycle.

FT  24 MAR 94 / Creditors come out in favour of Brazil
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   SAO PAULO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Brazil yesterday won approval from bank creditors to close its Dollars 52bn
(Pounds 35.6bn) commercial debt restructuring, without the formal support of
the International Monetary Fund.
Mr William Rhodes, vice-chairman of Citibank and chairman of the bank
steering committee, said that creditors holding more than two-thirds of the
debt had agreed to waive the IMF's involvement.
The deal needed 66 per cent approval to go ahead.
'This is the quickest waiver approval I've ever experienced,' Mr Rhodes
said. Banks had until the end of today to agree the waiver, he said.
The waiver became necessary after the IMF last week refused to grant Brazil
a stand-by loan, apparently reflecting concern about the viability of the
country's anti-inflation measures.
The usually appalling traffic in Sao Paulo, South America's largest city,
was even worse yesterday due to a series of strikes protesting against the
government's anti-inflation measures.
Metalworkers from Sao Paulo's main car plants blocked motorways in the south
of the city while services on the underground railway were delayed for two
hours.
Workers complained that the government's latest attempt to tackle inflation,
through the introduction of a new currency later this year, was damaging
their purchasing power.
Conditions returned to normal by late morning.

<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton will tonight hold perhaps the most important
televised press conference of his presidency. The White House expects it to
be dominated by the Whitewater affair, reports Jurek Martin from Washington.
The president is concerned by the extent to which the first family's
financial investments in Arkansas has deflected attention from his domestic
agenda. The broadcast gives him an opportunity to go over the heads of a
suspicious Washington political and media establishment to assure a national
audience only dimly aware of Whitewater that he has committed no wrongdoing
and is co-operating with all investigations.
Both houses of Congress have called for fully fledged hearings into
Whitewater.

<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton's policy towards Haiti yesterday came under fierce
attack from some of his most reliable supporters.
The Congressional Black Caucus, representing 40 African-American members of
Congress, urged Mr Clinton in a letter to scrap his Haitian policy and take
a tougher approach to the task of restoring ousted President Jean-Bertrand
Aristide to power.
The caucus urged Mr Clinton to cut air links with Haiti, deny visas to the
Haitian military and impose sanctions on any country violating the United
Nations embargo on trade with the Caribbean nation.
Many of the caucus's members - including Congressman Kweisi Mfume, its
chairman, and such senior congressmen as Mr Bill Clay of Missouri and Mr
Louis Stokes of Ohio - also signed an open letter published yesterday in the
New York Times accusing the administration of racism in its policy towards
Haitian refugees.
The letter, signed by mayors, actors, singers and civic leaders, complains
the US has 'effectively sealed Haitian political refugees into the death
chamber of their own island,' while offering safe haven to refugees from
countries like Vietnam, and Cuba.
'In no other case, against no other people has our nation employed measures
of automatic repatriation. Why just the Haitians? One is left to reasonably
conclude that our policy is driven by considerations of race,' the letter
says.

FT  24 MAR 94 / Fall in orders for US durable goods
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Orders for US durable goods fell 2.5 per cent between January and February,
more than expected in financial markets, but the decline mainly reflected a
sharp drop in aircraft orders, which tend to be highly volatile on a monthly
basis.
Excluding transport, orders were flat in February and up 8.6 per cent from
the same period last year. Excluding defence as well as transport, orders
edged higher last month.
Mr Ron Brown, commerce secretary, said the figures, adjusted for special
factors, were consistent with 'sustained economic growth'.
He said orders for non-defence capital goods, excluding aircraft - regarded
as a good guide to civilian investment trends - rose 5.3 per cent last
month.
'The manufacturing sector continues to expand,' said economists at CJ
Lawrence, a New York broker. 'Both durable goods orders and shipments are on
steep uptrends.' They predicted a sharp rebound in aircraft orders this
month.
Most analysts are anticipating a strong rebound in economic growth in March
after disruptions in several sectors as a result of severe winter weather
earlier in the year.

FT  24 MAR 94 / Wilder tempted by Virginia race
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Political Washington may be consumed with Whitewater, but it does not have
to look far afield for diversion. The neighbouring state of Virginia is
currently providing political theatre of the highest order.
The latest twist to its endless soap opera has come in the shape of public
musings by Mr Douglas Wilder, former governor, that he might have to enter
this year's Senate race to stop the state becoming, as he puts it, 'a
laughing stock'.
Most Virginians were surprised when Mr Wilder, a Democrat, pulled out of the
Senate contest in January. They had assumed he would not be able to resist
the temptation of taking on his long-time enemy, the incumbent Democratic
Senator Chuck Robb, whose staff had owned up to bugging Mr Wilder's
telephones.
They believed Mr Wilder, the state's first black governor, had concluded
that Mr Robb was more likely to beat former Lt Col Oliver North of
Iran-Contra notoriety, then considered the Republican favourite. He may also
have been influenced by the ease with which Mr George Allen, the
conservative Republican, won the governor's race last November.
But circumstances have changed and both Mr Robb and Mr North have fallen on
hard times. The former has finally confessed to being unfaithful to his wife
(the daughter of President Lyndon Johnson) while the latter has incurred the
wrath of ex-President Ronald Reagan for presuming to suggest that his old
boss knew more than he has let on about Iran-Contra.
Both men's favourable ratings have plunged to the low 30 per cent range,
according to one local poll. Mr North now only has a small lead in the
Republican contest over Mr James Miller, budget director in the Reagan
administration but hitherto an obscure personality in the state. Mr Miller
comes out even with Mr Robb, while Mr North trails the incum-bent senator by
17 points.
Meanwhile, Mr Allen, in spite of successes with the state legislature, has
also been no stranger to controversy, first saying he would join a private
club with a history of discrimination against blacks and women and then
changing his mind. His staunch support of a proposed new Disney historical
theme park in northern Virginia is also stirring up the local hornets.
The temptations for Mr Wilder are pretty obvious. 'People are joking about
us nationally,' he said this week. For a state which produced George
Washington and Thomas Jefferson, that is no laughing matter.

State Department officials said the US continued to work with backers of a
formula proposed by some members of Haiti's parliament that calls for Mr
Aristide's return but with no fixed date and without the removal of the
military leaders who ousted him. Mr Aristide has rejected the formula.
Mr Michael McCurry, State Department spokesman, acknowledged that a draft UN
resolution supporting this formula had made little headway. 'I don't know
how long it takes a UN resolution to get mouldy, but it has cer-tainly been
on the shelf,' he said.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Israeli army killed four Palestinians, allegedly members of the Hamas
Islamic resistance movement's military wing, during an 18-hour gunbattle in
Hebron that ended yesterday afternoon. A pregnant Palestinian woman also
died in the exchange of fire.
In clashes elsewhere in the town over the past 24 hours, another Palestinian
woman was killed and at least 50 other people injured, according to
Palestinian sources. In East Jerusalem an Israeli security guard died after
a lone assailant grabbed his gun and shot him in the head, before fleeing.
The Israeli army operation against the Hamas activists, which centred on a
building in southern Hebron, at one point threatened to cause the
cancellation of yesterday's Israeli-PLO talks in Cairo on resuming the peace
process, which has been suspended since last month's massacre in a Hebron
mosque.
Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman, telephoned Mr Warren Christopher, the US
secretary of state, late on Tuesday to protest at the Israeli army
operation. Mr Yassir Abed-Rabbo, Mr Arafat's aide, then warned that PLO
delegates might not attend the Cairo talks because of the latest killings.
However, the talks proceeded on scheduled.
The main focus of the PLO protest was apparently a claim, backed up
yesterday by Palestinian hospital sources, that a 34-year-old pregnant
Palestinian woman, Majeda Zahdeh, had been killed by the Israeli troops in
the course of the battle. General Ehud Barak, the Israeli army chief of
staff, claimed yesterday that she was 'apparently killed by gunfire from
inside the house, fired by the terrorists'.
Palestinian sources said the Israelis fired 100 anti-tank missiles into the
building, before bursting in yesterday and killing the four Palest-inians.
Army bulldozers were last night demolishing the building.
General Barak issued the first official report of the operation in the
course of his testimony yesterday before the Israeli commission
invest-igating last month's massacre of Palestinians, in Hebron's Cave of
the Patriarchs, by Jewish settler Baruch Goldstein.
The latest operation, he said, underlined that the army's continuing top
priority in the occupied territories was the battle against Palestinian
terrorism. Its second most important task, he added, was securing the roads
for Israeli travellers.
While it was also the army's job to provide security for Palestinians, he
continued, there was no way to guard completely against a madman like
Goldstein on a suicide mission. Nevertheless, he concluded, 'if the proper
security precautions had been implemented, they might very probably have
prevented the massacre, or at least greatly reduced the extent of the
crime'.

FT  24 MAR 94 / South Korea threatens to invade North if attacked
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
South Korea yesterday issued a veiled warning that if North Korea staged an
attack, Seoul would respond by invading the North to overthrow the
government of President Kim Il-sung.
'Our strategy is that, depending on the type of North Korean armed
provocation, we would make it an opportunity to realise unification,'
Defence Minister Rhee Byoung-tae said.
'There are no signs that North Korea will launch a provocation soon,'
although the North Korean army and air force have intensified their training
recently, he explained. 'But we cannot rule out the possibility if the UN
Security Council starts deliberating sanctions.'
The US and South Korea are now considering holding their joint Team Spirit
military exercise sometime this spring or summer, with late April being the
earliest date, he added.
The scheduling of the exercise is being determined by the arrival of 48 US
Patriot missile launchers, which are not expected in South Korea until
mid-April. They will take part in the Team Spirit. He said North Korea had
only limited time to drop opposition to international nuclear inspections if
it wanted to stop Team Spirit. 'Once the government officially announces the
resumption of Team Spirit, it will be difficult to suspend the exercise
again.'
Mr Han Sung-joo, South Korean foreign minister, said the key to resolving
the nuclear dispute lay in either UN sanctions against North Korea or
securing China's co-operation in persuading Pyongyang to accept inspections.
Neither South Korea nor the US intends to compromise on the basic issue of
full inspections with North Korea, including the resumption of inter-Korean
talks on mutual inspections as well as unrestricted access to the
International Atomic Energy Agency, he added.
South Korean President Kim Young-sam left early today on a six-day trip to
Japan and China to seek support in resolving the nuclear issue. His visit to
Beijing, beginning on Monday, is considered the most crucial stage of the
trip since he will ask Chinese President Jiang Zemin to intervene with North
Korea in the dispute. China has expressed opposition to sanctions,
explaining that the issue can be solved only through continued negotiations
between Pyongyang, Seoul and Washington.
In a mixed message, North Korea said yesterday it was prepared for new
negotiations as well as for armed conflict. 'As we have declared time and
again, we are fully prepared to answer dialogue with dialogue and war with
war.' It denounced deployment of Patriot missiles, accusing the US of
bringing the Korean peninsula 'to the brink of war'.
It also called on the South Korean people to overthrow their government. The
statement comes amid signs that students in Seoul are preparing to hold
demonstrations against the US, which they criticise for aggravating tensions
in Korea.

FT  24 MAR 94 / Cradock attacks policies of Hong Kong Governor Patten
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In London Sir Percy Cradock, Britain's former chief negotiator on Hong Kong,
yesterday attacked the policies of the present governor, Mr Chris Patten, in
even more personal terms than those he used to the House of Commons foreign
affairs committee last December, Edward Mortimer reports.
In a speech to the Royal Institute of International Affairs Sir Percy
recalled the phrase 'double whammy', used of Labour's tax policies by Mr
Patten when he was chairman of the Conservative party, and said that what
Britain had achieved in Hong Kong was 'quite a notable example'. Official
policy, he said, had an 'Alice in Wonderland' quality: 'All those who speak
up for democracy will have ended up by damaging it, and in the process will
have antagonised a rising superpower'.
Sir Percy also accused Mr Patten of putting undue pressure on LegCo, the
colony's legislative council, to adopt his proposals for the 1995 elections.
The people of Hong Kong, he claimed, were being 'pushed forward into a kind
of confrontation which I don't think they want'. He urged that LegCo be
allowed 'a whip-free vote', but alleged that 'in fact what has happened has
not been that. All the resources of Government House are being used to push
it through, including the placemen, the appointed members. They are being
asked to move forward like the troops of the Light Brigade.' In any case,
Sir Percy added, LegCo should not be the final arbiter. 'We remain
responsible until 1997. It does not lie in our ability to say 'it's very
unfortunate but this is what LegCo wanted'. That won't do.'

FT  24 MAR 94 / Icy Sino-British relations show signs of thaw: The row over
Hong Kong democracy may be near a resolution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's winter of bruising struggle with China over Hong Kong has given
way to a spring thaw.
Since Hong Kong's Legislative Council (LegCo) voted more than a month ago
for the first stage of Governor Chris Patten's political reform legislation,
Beijing has scaled back its attacks on the British.
Last week Mr Qian Qichen, China's foreign minister, suggested Beijing might
be prepared to draw a line under its row with Britain over democracy in Hong
Kong. He said co-operation with London could continue in spite of the row
over political development. This theme was taken up by Chinese Premier Li
Peng this week when he affirmed Beijing would not exclude UK companies from
the Chinese market because of the Hong Kong dispute.
British officials are used to having hopes raised only to see them dashed.
But the recent comments, together with other developments, were seen in the
colony as further evidence of what in different circumstances Sir Percy
Craddock, the British government's former China adviser, called 'the faint
musical sounds of the lake ice cracking in the sun'.
Beijing's more accommodative stance has been matched by London. Mr Patten
has virtually vacated the Hong Kong political stage since he returned from
Australia last month. This is a far cry from the political campaign which
the governor's advisers were promising in December when Sino-British talks
about Hong Kong broke down.
In recent weeks Beijing has given the impression of seeking a resolution to
a number of outstanding issues. The two sides appear to be closer than they
have ever been to an agreement on the issue of defence lands.
Senior officers of China's People's Liberation Army have been in Hong Kong
to view the government's plans for 'reprovisioning' defence facilities -
notably the HKDollars 1bn (Pounds 87m) construction of port facilities for
the Chinese navy on Stonecutters Island, in the middle of Hong Kong harbour.
Similarly, prospects for an agreement on the financing of Hong Kong's
multi-billion dollar airport project seem brighter than at any time for the
past two years. Earlier in the year the Hong Kong government capitulated to
demands from China to pump more cash into the project. China may yet wish to
extract further concessions but UK officials say they feel a deal is close
at hand.
In addition Beijing has shown signs of flexibility (or indecision) in
relation to Hong Kong's post-1997 constitution. During and immediately after
last year's failed Sino-British negotiations on the colony's constitutional
development Beijing's position was uncompromising. It threatened to overturn
all political arrangements made without its agreement.
But the recent meeting of China's National People's Congress (NPC) suggested
Beijing's position has become less dogmatic. Mr Li clearly stated that
'British enterprises are welcome to participate in the Chinese market,'
adding that Beijing would make efforts to minimise the negative effects of
the Sino-British row on bilateral trade.
During the NPC, there was confusion over the meaning of a resolution on Hong
Kong politics and an inability of delegates from Hong Kong to speak with one
voice. A resolution proposed by Mr Cheng Yiu-tong, chairman of New World
Development, a large Hong Kong property and infrastructure developer,
recommended abolition of the colony's 'political structure' after 1997. In
the end the NPC did not vote on Mr Cheng's motion. This gave comfort to
those who believe Beijing does not want to box itself in, but rather wants
to leave itself room for manoeuvre.
Mr Qian's remarks last week were among the more emollient to come from a
Chinese leader in months and Mr Li's comments indicated that Beijing was not
prepared to jeopardise all aspects of ties with Britain.
Mr Qian highlighted the work of the Joint Liaison Group (JLG), a bilateral
group dealing with the mechanics of the transfer. The foreign minister said
the activities of the JLG, and its sub-committee dealing with the airport,
had been unaffected by the political row. His comments were welcomed by Mr
Hugh Davies, Britain's chief representative to the JLG, who said they were
'very encouraging'.
Mr Qian, perhaps recognising that Beijing has been losing the hearts and
minds campaign in Hong Kong, went on to underline China's commitment to the
colony. 'Despite a breakdown of Sino-British talks on the political
structure arrangement of Hong Kong, China still cares about Hong Kong's
economy and the livelihood of its people,' he said. But in spite of his
softer tone, UK and Hong Kong government officials point out there is a long
way to go before resumption of constructive co-operation on Hong Kong.
Central to this is a resolution of differences over the colony's legal
system.
The 'localisation' of Hong Kong law - to bring it into line with the Basic
Law, China's mini-constitution for post-1997 Hong Kong - has proceeded
painfully slowly. There are about 600 laws in Hong Kong needing amendment;
half of these are based on UK enactments and about 200 relate to
international treaties.
Since April 1990, when China enacted the Basic Law, only 30 of the laws have
been approved, and about half of the treaties agreed in principle. Moreover,
Hong Kong has yet to legislate for the Court of Final Appeal, the court
which will supersede the Privy Council in London.
Legislation is being drawn up to give effect to a 1991 agreement between
London and Beijing on the court. Details of the legislation will, however,
need to be agreed through the JLG. When Hong Kong government officials heard
Mr Qian say that 'both sides should make efforts to ensure Hong Kong's
prosperity and stability' they hoped he was referring to the colony's legal
system.

Government troops occupying the former Khmer Rouge headquarters at Pailin
are finding unseasonal rain wreaking havoc with a new road built to supply
them with food and ammunition, while malaria is affecting their health and
morale.
After two weeks of heavy fighting, government commanders say they are in
control of the former Khmer Rouge base, but guerrillas still occupy
commanding positions near by.
The victory at Pailin came rapidly; there is talk in the Cambodian capital
that this marks the end of the Khmer Rouge as a viable force. It is a bad
political blow to the faction, but loss of an important base will not stop
rebel units continuing their campaign. The loss of Pailin has also hit the
Khmer Rouge in another way: Gem mines and timber in the area have until now
earned them millions of dollars a year.
Senior officers say at least 10,000 government troops supported by heavy
artillery and helicopter gunships were involved in the assault on Pailin.
Government soldiers are now pushing into surrounding hills to clear out
remaining Khmer Rouge pockets.
The main obstacle now facing the government side is the logistics. 'Their
ability to supply and communicate with their troops is being severely
stretched,' one diplomat said.
At least 20 kilometres from the base, the new road is blocked and the rest
of the way is only passable to military tanks. On Wednesday, one tank
carrying soldiers and three freelance photographers hit an anti-tank mine.
Two soldiers were killed.
Government troops at Pailin are short of food and medicine; water supplies
are low. In one unit, most soldiers had not been given their Dollars
20-a-month wages for six months before the attack. Since losing Pailin,
guerrillas have attacked five villages, killing eight people.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A wider-than-expected ministerial reshuffle in Australia's federal
government was in prospect yesterday amid speculation that Senator Graham
Richardson, one of the most senior figures in the Australian Labor Party,
was about to resign from the health portfolio.
Prime Minister Paul Keating is due to announce a new ministerial line-up
later today. This is in response the recent departures of Ms Ros Kelly, the
former minister for sport, environment and territories, and Mr Alan
Griffiths, the previous industry minister.
Some elements of their portfolios have already been re-allocated on a
permanent basis, but a number of ministerial responsibilities have been
'warehoused' (put on hold).
This is partly in expectation of the arrival of the former Western
Australian premier, Ms Carmen Lawrence, in Canberra.
She won a federal seat in a recent by-election and entered parliament this
week.
Ms Lawrence had been widely-tipped to take over the environment portfolio,
although talk of her receiving Senator Richardson's health responsibilities
had also been mooted before the latest resignation rumours surfaced.
Relations between Mr Keating and Senator Richardson have been strained
lately, following a public dispute over whether the Medicare levy should be
raised significantly to fund new programmes.
If Senator Richardson does depart, he will be the fourth senior government
minister to step down in as many months. Mr John Dawkins, the former
treasurer, left politics altogether just before Christmas.
Mr Griffiths resigned in January, amid allegations that party funds had been
used in the 'Above the Line' sandwich shop, a private business venture.
Ms Ros Kelly departed after it was claimed a sports grant programme favoured
marginal Labor electorates. Both Ms Kelly and Mr Griffiths maintained that
they had done nothing wrong.

FT  24 MAR 94 / ANC demands end to KwaZulu 'homeland': A harder stance
towards Buthelezi's poll boycott
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The African National Congress yesterday called on South Africa's multi-party
Transitional Executive Council to take over the administration of the
KwaZulu black homeland from Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, putting the ANC and
the chief's Inkatha Freedom party on a collision course.
The call, from Mr Jacob Zuma, ANC deputy secretary general, the highest
ranking Zulu in the ANC, represents a significant hardening of the
organisation's position on KwaZulu, the only one of the 10 black homelands
which continues to offer political opposition to the ANC. Asked whether the
ANC-dominated TEC, which oversees government in the run-up to elections,
should send in troops to remove Chief Buthelezi from power, Mr Zuma replied:
'Why not?'
The TEC said on Tuesday night it would take all steps to ensure free
political activity in KwaZulu/Natal, where some 85 people have died since
the weekend. Inkatha supporters have prevented ANC election rallies and made
voter education in KwaZulu almost impossible. And Although Chief Buthelezi
said last night he would allow the Independent Electoral Commission to
prepare for elections in the homeland, he has given these assurances in the
past without persuading his supporters to respect them.
Mr Zuma said the TEC should cut off government funding to KwaZulu, which is
a semi-autonomous 'self-governing territory' within South Africa but
receives all of its funds from Pretoria.
The ANC would tomorrow launch a campaign of mass action aimed at
demonstrating that most Zulus oppose Chief Buthelezi's plan to boycott
April's all-race elections. The campaign would begin with a mass march in
Durban on Friday and continue with civil servants' protests.
International mediation of constitutional issues would continue, he said -
indeed ANC sources said yesterday Lord Carrington, former British foreign
secretary, and Mr Henry Kissinger, former US secretary of state, would be
asked to mediate - but results would probably not come soon enough to
resolve the crisis.
The ANC has successfully eliminated all opposition from other homeland
governments, widely vilified as the creations of apartheid. Other
governments have either been ousted as a result of popular pressure
orchestrated by the ANC - Brig Oupa Gqozo was removed from power in the
Ciskei homeland on Tuesday night, and President Lucas Mangope of
Bophuthatswana was deposed 10 days ago - or thrown in their lot with the
group which they expect to lead South Africa's next government.
ANC officials, excited by victories in Ciskei and Bophuthatswana and angry
at Chief Buthelezi's campaign to prevent elections in Natal, yesterday
adopted a more belligerent tone towards KwaZulu.
Said one senior official, normally a moderate: 'Buthelezi must learn the
lesson of Bop (Bophuthatswana). The KwaZulu police, the youth and the civil
service - the same forces which brought down the Bop government - are
present in KwaZulu: the time has come for them to stand up and be counted,'
he said, adding the ANC only needed 'a trigger' to provoke Buthelezi's
deposition within weeks.
All of the homelands, including KwaZulu, will cease to exist after
elections. But ANC officials said they could not wait for the poll before
removing Chief Buthelezi. Too many people were being killed in his campaign
to prevent voting, they said.
But KwaZulu differs greatly from the other homelands where unpopular leaders
have been toppled: Chief Buthelezi commands significant support in the
homeland and and he is unlikely to crumble as other homeland leaders have
done. But thousands of KwaZulu police and civil servants depend for their
salaries and pensions on funding from central government, which will be
controlled by the ANC after April. The next few weeks will tell whether they
decide to revolt, as did their counterparts in other homelands.

Finland intends to extend its territorial waters to 12 nautical miles from
the present four, the Finnish news agency STT reported yesterday. It said
the centre-right government made the decision at a meeting and a proposal
would be submitted to parliament before the middle of the year. A corridor
of international waters at least six nautical miles wide would remain
between Finland and Estonia in the Gulf of Finland that leads to the Russian
city of St Petersburg. One reason behind the move is to help Finnish
authorities check cross-border traffic to prevent smuggling and other crime.
It would also help efforts to protect the marine environment. Neighbouring
Sweden extended its waters in 1979 and Estonia decided about a year ago to
do the same.

in stages and bring in an annual SFr1.3bn (Pounds 607m) by the year 2000.
The government said at least two-thirds of the money raised would be pumped
back into the economy, but details of how this would be done have not yet
been fixed. The carbon tax would add 8.3 Swiss centimes to the cost of a
litre of petrol. Lead-free petrol, the most popular variety, costs about
SFr1.16 a litre. The aim of the tax would be to stabilise carbon dioxide
emissions and overall consumption of fossil fuels in Switzerland at their
1990 level and subsequently to reduce them, the government said.

The Bundesbank yesterday sanctioned another drop in the key securities
repurchase rate, from 5.88 per cent last week to 5.80 per cent. But the
independent DIW institute for economic research said in its weekly report
that the central bank's tentative interest rate cuts were prolonging
Germany's recession and causing unemployment to rise more sharply than would
otherwise be the case.
The institute said there was room for lower interest rates because unit
labour costs fell seasonally in 1993 and were likely to fall again in 1994.
It also questioned the reliability of M3 as a guide for the central bank's
monetary policies. The institute said the high interest rates would also
'choke off' the next economic recovery and prevent prolonged growth.

<TEXT>
The European economy should be growing by 2 per cent a year by 1995,
although unemployment will continue to rise until after 1996, the European
Commission's annual report on the state of the European economy concludes.
The report, which was officially approved by the Commission yesterday,
forecasts that gross domestic product in the European Union could grow by as
much as 3 per cent by 1996, after 1.3 per cent growth this year, and a fall
of 0.3 per cent last year.
However, the report warns that this will not be enough to prevent
unemployment rising to a record 11.25 per cent in 1995, up from a predicted
11.2 per cent in 1994 and 10.6 per cent last year. The outlook prompted the
Commission to reiterate its calls for Europe's banks to lower interest
rates, stressing that this would be essential to stimulate further growth.
'Despite the reductions that have taken place in the course of 1993,
short-term interest rates remain high given the cyclical position,' the
Commission noted. It added: 'A continued cautious monetary easing in 1994
appears to be largely discounted by both consumers and investors so that a
process of accelerated cuts in borrowing costs may be required in order to
provide the basis for an upswing in economic sentiment and activity.'

FT  24 MAR 94 / Kurds seek last word on Turkish poll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ADANA, SOUTHERN TURKEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Drive south from Adana to the poor suburb of Daglioglu, and there comes a
point in the road where the campaign flags and posters suddenly disappear.
Among clusters of dismal mud-built tenements it would be easy to forget that
Turkey was preparing for municipal elections on Sunday.
This is a vote which the politicians in Ankara believe could be the prelude
to early general elections, or at the very least a shake-out in the current
conservative-led coalition of Mrs Tansu Ciller.
Adana is in many ways the electoral frontline, Some 500km south of Ankara,
it is the Turkish city closest to the Kurdish heartland in the south-east,
where the separatist conflict has seriously curtailed the electoral process.
Adana has a proud history. Briefly under French occupation after the Second
World War, the city is an ethnic mosaic, where Turks, Arabs and Kurds live
side by side in the heart of a rich agricultural belt. Four of Turkey's
biggest industrial conglomerates trace their fortunes to the cotton fields
and the textile wealth of the nearby Cukurova plain. This prosperity has
proven a strong magnet for large numbers of economic migrants from poorer
regions, particularly the nearby Kurdish-speaking areas.
However, in the last few years, the cracks have been showing in Adana as the
separatist violence has spread. The social and economic strains created by
poor Kurds seeking work or escaping the pressures of the war have presented
the municipality with a serious problem. The unemployment rate - although no
ethnic breakdown is available - is believed to be twice as high in the
Kurdish community compared with the city as a whole.
More worrying is the prospect of a widespread Turkish nationalist backlash
in the city. Some residents believe it has already started. It was here that
the police took the unprecedented step of marching in protest against the
office of the human rights association, which is widely seen by local Turks
as being a front for radical Kurdish elements.
Community loyalties are certainly stretched. When Mr Selahattin Colak, the
mayor, first stood for office in 1977, local residents remember him openly
playing on his Kurdish origins to win votes. This time around he is being
more discreet. Even Mr Colak is not venturing into the majority-Kurdish
Daglioglu district, a no-go area for most of Adana's citizens.
At night the roads are patrolled by armoured personnel carriers with search
lights scanning the alleyways for snipers of the Kurdish Workers' party
(PKK). In what was once the city's Arab quarter, angry young radicals say
they will boycott Sunday's vote, a pattern which is likely to be repeated in
hundreds of towns and hamlets in the Kurdish-speaking region.
At the national level, Sunday's polling to appoint mayors in more than 2,000
towns, is the first real test of the popularity of Mrs Ciller since she was
chosen as leader of her True Path party (DYP) in June and became prime
minister after Mr Suleyman Demirel moved to the presidency. A bad showing
could trigger defections from her DYP and a possible leadership challenge.
The main opposition Motherland party is describing the elections as a
national referendum on Mrs Ciller's nine-month-old administration. The vote
is also important as a measure of the growing national support for the
Islamic Refah party (RP).
In the south-east, merely holding the elections without disruption is
presenting a challenge to the authorities. Diplomats point out that this is
the first time since restoration of parliamentary government in 1982 that
Kurdish violence has threatened nationwide elections.
However, a widespread boycott would provide the most visible evidence yet of
the extent to which the Turkish government has lost credibility in the
Kurdish region.
Ten days ago the Interior Ministry issued special instructions to secure the
polling stations, but only after the pro-Kurdish Democracy party (DEP) had
already withdrawn its candidates.
According to some unofficial estimates from western embassies, the DEP might
have been expected to win about 70 per cent in a free vote. However, the
intimidation faced by the party has been considerable. At least 54 of its
officials have been assassinated in the past two years. More recently, five
DEP MPs have been arrested in Ankara and could now face the death penalty on
charges of making speeches espousing the radical Kurdish cause.
In today's climate of fear, many locals believe almost the only people who
will turn out to vote will be the Korucu - the government-armed village
guards and their families. In such an event, many towns and villages will
fall into the hands of the neo-fascist party, the Nationalist Movement.

Romania's minority left-wing government has removed 15 mayors and 12 other
local elected officials, accusing them of abusing their power and
mismanaging public money, the state news agency Rompres said yesterday. The
unprecedented wave of sackings, which hit many opposition figures,
immediately drew denunciations from opposition parties. The government
accused the officials, including the mayor of Bucharest, of 'grave
infringements of the law', which included the mismanagement of funds derived
from land leases. But the opposition National Peasant party called the
sackings 'illegal and abusive'.

Finland could stage a referendum on EU membership on the same day as other
Nordic countries on November 13, the prime minister, Mr Esko Aho, was quoted
as saying yesterday. Sweden, Finland, Norway and Austria reached preliminary
agreements on EU membership terms this month, but the accords need to be
approved by national referendums. According to Mr Aho it was not an
'excluded option' that the three Nordic EU applicants would stage their
plebiscites on the same day. Opinion polls show that public support for
membership is larger in Finland than in neighbouring Sweden and Norway.

Further evidence that Sweden's toughest recession for 50 years ended during
1993 emerged yesterday when the latest industrial production figures showed
growth of 8.4 per cent in the year to January, with production rising by 0.8
per cent in January over December. Recovery has been strongest in the
mining, engineering and manufacturing sectors, but the big paper and pulp
industry has shown a fall in output. Figures from the Riksbank also showed
the strength of the surge in exports that is driving the recovery. Exports
were up by 29 per cent in January, over January 1993, producing a trade
surplus of SKr7.5bn (Pounds 640m) for the month. But heavy debt servicing
meant the current account was in deficit to the tune of SKr4.7bn. The
current account deficit for the 12-month period to January was SKr3.5bn.
Hugh Carnegy, Stockholm.
The French index of household consumption was stable in February after
rising by 0.9 per cent in January.
Portuguese unemployment rose to 6.8 per cent in the first quarter of 1994,
from 6.2 per cent in the previous quarter and 5.1 per cent in the first
three months of 1993.
Consumer prices in the west German state of North Rhine-Westphalia rose 0.2
per cent in the month to mid-March, taking the year-on-year increase to 3.1
per cent.

FT  24 MAR 94 / Solana takes heart from British
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE and TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'An unholy alliance' is how Spanish ministers term their uneasy partnership
with the UK in the Euro-voting rights crisis obstructing the entry of
Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway into the Union. The 10 member states
opposing Anglo-Spanish attempts to change the EU's majority voting formula
are working hard to prise them apart - and leave the UK isolated.
It will not be easy. Mr Javier Solana, the Spanish foreign minister, is
playing both for his country and his own political future in the fraught
argument. And he may have found an ideal vehicle in his partnership with
Britain.
At 51, he is one of only two cabinet ministers to have survived from the
first Gonzalez government 11 years ago and
last weekend regained a seat on the Socialist party's executive committee.
With his eye on positioning himself as an eventual successor to Mr Felipe
Gonzalez, the prime minister, he has taken the lead in the enlargement talks
from the veteran EU negotiator, the technocrat Mr Carlos Westendorp, state
secretary for European affairs and taken the British to heart.
'Any solution (to the voting row) has to satisfy our two countries,' he said
yesterday. 'It is very difficult to imagine a solution which would satisfy
one country and not the other.'
The mood is catching. An aide to Mr Gonzalez said Spain did not relish the
idea of being out on a limb and arguing on grounds of vital national
interests. 'It is better to flex our muscles as part of a combined veto
rather than test whether we have a power of veto ourselves,' he said.
There is also political pressure at home to stiffen Mr Solana's resolve.
Although the Socialist government does not have to cope with a domestic
anti-European lobby as does the UK government, the conservative Popular
Party opposition has long accused it of being naive and weak in its dealings
with the Union.
Criticism from northern Spanish fishermen over the deal struck last week
with Norway on fishing rights has increased pressure on Mr Solana to stand
his ground over voting arrangements.
Madrid has always seen this as the most important issue and it has remained
united on it despite cool personal relations between Mr Solana and Mr
Westendorp.
Madrid is resisting changes to the voting formula because it does not want
to be in a losing minority over questions such as Mediterranean products or
structural funds.
In addition, it has a deep-seated ambivalence about EU enlargement, part of
the 'European project' to which Spain is ideologically committed but
potentially detrimental to its own interests. It fears it could be
marginalised as the EU's centre of gravity shifts northwards and eastwards.
Nevertheless, the 10 are addressing compromise solutions more at Spain
because they think Madrid is more likly to cave in than London. Madrid is
seen as defending identifiable and circumscribed nat-ional interests such as
Mediterranean agriculture, whereas the British government is seen as
parading factional interests of the Conservative party.

</HEADLINE>

   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany entered an already bruising debate over
enlargement of the European Union yesterday by promising he would make
strenuous efforts to open further the EU to the countries of central Europe
when Germany takes over the presidency this year.
Implicitly attacking opposition to enlargement of the EU - dramatised
recently in top-level French criticism of Germany's enthusiasm for the
process - Mr Kohl insisted that 'the Baltic Sea is just as much a European
sea as the Mediterranean. It is quite simply intolerable for us to adopt the
attitude that we want to create some sort of closed shop'.
He rejected any attempt to turn the EU into a 'glorified free trade area',
insisting that enlargement must go hand in hand with closer integration and
reinforcement of European institutions.
At the same time he sharply criticised Britain and Spain for holding up the
current enlargement negotiations with Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden
over technical changes in the voting rules.
Mr Kohl, whose government will take over the EU presidency on July 1,
suggested new moves to involve the four likely central European candidates
for EU membership more closely in Union decisions.
One proposal would be to extend EU summit meetings to include the leaders of
Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia in a regular exchange of
views on common problems.
Their participation would ensure that EU decisions were not taken that would
make their eventual membership more difficult.
A second idea would be to invite those countries - 'in the near future' - to
send deputies to the European parliament as non-voting members, in a
consultative role.
Mr Kohl left no doubt that he sees extension of the EU to the east as a top
priority and of vital national interest for Germany. He said it was
'unthinkable' that Germany's eastern border, the Oder-Neisse border with
Poland, 'should remain the eastern border of the European Union'.
Only by simultaneously 'deepening' the EU, while the enlargement process
continued, could 'peace and freedom' in Europe be assured, he said.
'With a glorified free trade area we would never manage to achieve this in a
lasting way.'

FT  24 MAR 94 / Moscow's monetarist swerve wins over IMF
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The agreement between Russia and the International Monetary Fund signed late
on Tuesday will - if fulfilled - commit ministers to exceptionally tough
measures, including cutting spending programmes if revenue fails to match
targets.
However, a major reason Mr Michel Camdessus, the IMF director general,
backed the deal was his team's recognition that the Russian government is
already running a tight monetary policy - with real interest rates now
around 10 per cent a month, among the highest in the world.
The high rates, and the limiting of credit, has been in part the result of a
new policy by the central bank. Under Mr Victor Gerashchenko, the chairman,
the bank has veered from a provider of cheap credit to a pillar of
monetarist orthodoxy - as the influence of new young officials has become
felt.
The commitments made by the government to obtain the second Dollars 1.5bn
(Pounds 1.02bn) tranche of the IMF's systemic transformation facility
include:
Agreement to bring down inflation to 7 per cent a month by December 1994.
Raising new taxes and improving revenue collection. A provision, in lieu of
a contingency reserve which is deemed too open to plundering by parliament,
that all extra spending or loss of revenue will be compensated by cuts in
agreed spending programmes.
Professor Anders Aslund of the Stockholm Institute for the Study of East
European Economies, a former Russian ministerial adviser, said last night
that 'though Gaidar and Fyodorov (former reformist ministers) may be blamed
for the collapse, Chernomyrdin is following their policy and it means that
industrial restructuring is now happening'.
Mr Camdessus said privately he was impressed by the turnaround in the
central bank, whose officials he thought at least as pro-reform as those in
the more conventionally radical ministry of finance.

Chancellor Helmut Kohl has warmly welcomed a proposal from Britain's prime

at 50th anniversary celebrations in London of the end of the Second World
War, Our Foreign Staff writes. The British leader's invitation appears to be
an attempt to defuse a gathering diplomatic row over British and French
reluctance to invite the German chancellor to celebrate the 50th anniversary

it could be done in a 'good and dignified manner'.

FT  24 MAR 94 / Nordic states fear effect on referendums: 'All this is
making Swedes ask: What kind of a Union is this?'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A sense of irritation, frustration and mounting anxiety was evident in the
Nordic capitals yesterday as the governments of Finland, Norway and Sweden
watched their carefully laid plans to bring their reticent countries into
the European Union threatened by a row they have no power to influence.
The dispute between Britain and Spain and their 10 fellow EU members over
voting rights after the three Nordic applicants and Austria enter the Union
has shattered the optimistic mood that prevailed when accession terms were
settled this month after months of tough negotiations.
A compromise that will allow enlargement to go ahead is still expected in
the north. But there is a growing fear that the issue will not be resolved
for some time, leading to the entry date for the applicants - set for
January 1 next year - being delayed and making the task of persuading the
three already reluctant electorates to vote for membership in referendums in
the autumn much more difficult.
'In the worst case scenario this could lead to a No vote in the referendum,'
said a senior Swedish official. 'All this is making Swedes ask: 'What kind
of a Union, what kind of an organisation, is this?' It is so stupid because
it should have been sorted out long ago. And it is frustrating because there
is nothing we can do about it.'
The frustration is heightened because polls in Finland, Sweden and Norway
had begun to show a strengthening of the Yes camp, leading the three
governments to feel that they were at last beginning to win the referendum
argument - even in Norway, where opposition is strongest. 'We have become
fairly optimistic that if given a clear six months to explain the issues, we
have a sporting chance to win. This is not going to help,' said an aide to
Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland, the Norwegian prime minister.
The domestic embarrassment is especially acute for Mr Carl Bildt, the
Swedish prime minister whose conservative Moderate Party is close to the
British Conservative Party. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the British chancellor, was
in Stockholm on Tuesday, but offered little comfort, apparently telling Mr
Bildt he was pessimistic about achieving a breakthrough on the voting issue.
'I think we understand the problems facing Major inside his party. But he
has cornered himself. Of course we are concerned if Major is going to go
back to the Thatcher attitude on Europe,' the Swedish official remarked.
The three Nordic governments have by no means given up hope of a resolution
and have been careful not to make apocalyptic public pronouncements.
If a solution is found soon, attention in the referendum campaigns is likely
to shift quickly back to the core issues of national sovereignty, the price
of membership for the economy and, especially in Norway and Finland, the
effects on agricultural and fishing communities. But those debates will be
hard enough to win without additional squabbles reverberating from Brussels.

FT  24 MAR 94 / Belgium makes plans for telecom sell-off

<TEXT>
The Belgian government yesterday took its first step towards privatisation
of the state telecommunications group Belgacom by announcing a review of
options for selling parts of the company.
However, Mr Jean Luc Dehaene, the prime minister, warned that privatisation
was unlikely before 1995, and said the government would retain a majority
stake.
The government and Belgacom will now appoint consultants to draw up plans
for privatisation, which is expected to include proposals for the company to
link with 'strategic' partners, create synergies with other
telecomunications groups, and float shares on the Belgian stock market,
probably by 1996.
Mr Bessel Kok, chief executive officer, said yesterday Belgacom was holding
informal discussions with several leading European and US groups with a view
to forming these strategic alliances.
Although the privatisation of Belgacom is at the centre of Belgium's
privatisation programme, which is expected to raise BFr40bn (Pounds 754m) in
1994, the government warned that the sale of Belgacom was unlikely to
contribute much this year, and noted that several obstacles still remained
to the sale.
These include a requirement that the company raise more than BFr100m to
cover future pension liabilities.
Mr Kok said Belgacom was 'not dissatisfied' with the conditions the
government was imposing on the privatisation and welcomed an end to the
uncertainty about the company's future that has dogged it in recent months.
'I am pleased that the floating technique has been mentioned as a vision for
the future and that they have recognised the need for international
alliances,' he said.
However he admitted that it remained unclear what the government was
proposing in its recommendation that Belgacom should seek more 'integration'
and synergies with other companies.
Mr Dehaene refused to set any timetable for the implementation of the
consultants' report, but said that privatisation was 'more likely to occur
in 1995 or 1996 than 1994'.
'We must not act too quickly or too slowly,' he said, stressing that the
government wanted to take a 'calm' approach to the sell-off, which has
provoked considerable controversy in Belgium.
Nevertheless, he added that the privatisation would need to occur before the
end of 1998 - the deadline for the EU-wide liberalisation of voice services.

FT  24 MAR 94 / Brittan rejects action over low-wage exporters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES and DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Leon Brittan, the European trade commissioner, yesterday ruled out trade
action against foreign exporters into the European Union who benefit from
relatively low wages and social costs. He said any such measures would
amount to 'naked protectionism' and would not relieve unemployment in
Europe.
However, he said the EU should propose at next month's ministerial meeting
of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in Marrakesh, Morocco, that
the question of workers' rights should be placed on the agenda of the
planned World Trade Organisation.
Sir Leon's statement, which was broadly approved by his fellow
commissioners, goes some way to meet US demands that workers' rights be made
an early priority for the WTO, while firmly rebuffing the most extreme
opponents of so-called social dumping on both sides of the Atlantic. His
remarks coincided with an apparent softening in the public stance of France,
which has so far been the most outspoken critic of social dumping in the EU.
The French government said in a statement that countries should not be
allowed to gain undue advantage from lax labour and environmental standards.
However, it recognised that low-wage competition was 'a fact of
international trade' and said that environmental safeguards should not serve
as a pretext for trade protection.
By steering clear of any proposal which would discriminate against exporters
purely on cost grounds, French officials believe they stand a better chance
of winning support from industrialised countries for a discussion of labour
and environment standards in the WTO.
This point was underlined separately by Sir Leon, who said there was 'no
chance whatsoever of achieving any international consensus in favour of
permitting trade action to be used against countries which do no more than
benefit from lower wage or social security costs'. Such action would, in any
case, do little to help EU economies, because they imported little from
low-cost countries and because labour costs were only one factor determining
corporate investment decisions and international competitiveness.
Sir Leon said there was no possibility of substantive decisions on trade and
social policy issues in Marrakesh, but that the EU should support proposals
for a debate in the WTO. The EU should ensure that any future decisions were
based on a multilateral approach and on objective criteria.
He said the Gatt would allow the EU to act before then by legislating to
prohibit imports produced by prison labour.
However, he warned that such laws could be difficult to enforce and might
amount to little more than a political gesture.
He said the EU should also examine ways of monitoring and enforcing more
effectively compliance with conventions adopted in the International Labour
Organisation and press the US to ratify more such conventions.

FT  24 MAR 94 / Anger over seizure of documents at Italian party HQ:
Berlusconi denounces 'orchestrated' action
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The pent-up anger in the final stages of Italy's election campaign exploded
yesterday when police seized documents from the headquarters of Mr Silvio
Berlusconi's Forza Italia movement.
Media magnate Mr Berlusconi made an enraged attack upon what he claimed was
a politically orchestrated action against the movement's Rome and Milan
offices.
He will meet President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro today to express his concern
about the degeneration of the electoral contest, due to take place on
Sunday.
Mr Berlusconi leads the rightwing bloc, which in polls last week was
marginally ahead. But Forza Italia was able to claim the scalp of one of the
leading figures in the former communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS)
which is spearheading the anti-Berlusconi campaign.
Mr Luciano Violante, the head of the parliamentary anti-mafia commission,
was forced to resign yesterday following an interview in which he alleged Mr
Marcello Dell'Utri, an important member of Mr Berlusconi's entourage, was
under investigation by Catania magistrates for arms and drugs trafficking.
Police moved into Forza Italia headquarters in Milan and Rome yesterday
morning on the orders of magistrates from Palmi near Reggio Calabria. For
almost two years, the Palmi magistrature has been conducting an
investigation that links membership of secret masonic lodges with organised
crime, elements in the security services, and political parties. It said it
had requested police to obtain a list of Forza Italia clubs, their members
and party candidates.
'This was totally without justification and involved no notification of any
crime having been committed,' Mr Berlusconi said.
He added: 'This has never happened before in our democracy. These things
only happen in totalitarian states. In a free country the electorate are
those who judge the parties with their vote.'
Some of his aides suggested he would ask President Scalfaro to postpone the
elections. It was the second time during the campaign that he has complained
to the president of unfair treatment by the opposition.
The conflict between the PDS-led Progressive Alliance and the Berlusconi
camp has been intensifying for several days. The PDS has not forgiven Mr
Berlusconi for his exploitation of his commercial television network to make
Forza Italia a leading political player.
Mr Berlusconi, meanwhile, believes many institutions of state, including the
magistrature, are sympathetic to the PDS and deliberately sabotaging Forza
Italia.
The PDS has been trying to undermine Mr Berlusconi's credibility as an
entrepreneur. It also sensed he was politially inept at handling criticism
in public. As a result, it has forced him away from his carefully scripted
role as the seductive purveyor of good news.
Mr Violante, however, made a serious error in breaching judicial secrecy and
revealing the state of investigations into Mr Dell'Utri, the head of
Publitalia, the advertising arm of Fininvest.

FT  24 MAR 94 / Inflation figures hit early rate cut hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Disappointing inflation figures for February dashed hopes of an early cut in
base rates and pushed UK share prices down sharply yesterday.
Retailers raised prices during the month, particularly on clothing and
footwear, following heavy discounting in the January sales.
In London the FT-SE 100 index dropped 46.2 points yesterday to 3,155.3, a
low for the year. Gilt prices also dropped, with the June long gilt future
falling by three-quarters of a point.
The retail prices index rose 0.6 per cent month-on-month, according to the
Central Statistical Office, more rapidly than the 0.4 per cent analysts had
been expecting.
The headline rate of inflation, the annual rise in the RPI, fell to 2.4 per
cent in February from 2.5 per cent in January, as a substantial increase in
February 1993 dropped out of the annual comparison. Analysts had expected
the RPI figure would fall to 2.2 per cent.
Similarly, the underlying annual rate, which excludes mortgage payments, was
unchanged at 2.8 per cent compared with the consensus forecast of a fall to
2.6 per cent. The government's present target range for underlying inflation
is 1-4 per cent.
Recent inflationary signals have been mixed with weak figures on producer
prices in February offset by news of a small rise in the annual rate of
growth of average earnings in December.
Some traders had been hoping that good inflation figures yesterday might
allow the government to reduce base rates from their current 5.25 per cent.
However, Mr John Marsland, economist at the broker UBS, said the
'disappointing figure puts back the date of the next rate cut'.
Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, and Mr Kenneth Clarke, the
chancellor, will hold their next monthly monetary meeting on Wednesday.
Analysts think it unlikely that they will want to cut base rates without
some evidence that February's inflation figures were a blip rather than a
sign of an upsurge in price pressures.
Mr Adrian Cooper, UK economist at broker James Capel, said the authorities
would want to wait until April 15 when the March inflation figures are
announced before making a cut.

FT  24 MAR 94 / Major willing to compromise over EU voting rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major last night raised the possibility of a two-tier voting system
in the European Union to break the deadlock over voting rights when four new
countries join next year.
Amid intense diplomatic activity to end the stalemate which has pitted
Britain and Spain against their 10 EU partners, Mr Major insisted the
Council of Ministers' present voting arrangements must remain for
contentious issues such as social policy legislation.
But after a meeting with the prime minister, senior Conservative MPs said he
appeared willing to allow the number of votes required to create a blocking
majority to be increased from 23 to 27 for less controversial issues.
Officials said Mr Major was studying a potential compromise involving a
legally binding protocol that would allow countries mustering between 23 and
27 votes in the Council to postpone decisions indefinitely.
The two-tier proposal would mean that 23 votes - representing two large
countries and one small - would still be enough to block directives in areas
such as employment policy, where Britain most fears an extension of EU
authority. But the number would rise to 27 for other less contentious areas
of legislation.
Mr Major raised the possible compromise at a private lunch with senior Tory
backbench MPs at which he insisted that Britain would defend implacably its
position at this weekend's meeting of EU foreign ministers in Greece.
The attraction of the suggestion was that it offered the hope of breaking
the deadlock with Britain's European partners, while satisfying demands on
the Tory back benches that Britain's power to veto contentious legislation
must not be diluted.
Whitehall officials cautioned that there might be serious practical
difficulties in deciding which directives would fall into which category in
any two-tier system. The proposal might also face strong opposition from
other EU governments.
But the substance of the compromise might be preserved in the suggested
legally binding protocol that would allow decisions to be shelved
indefinitely if countries representing more than 23 votes opposed them.
Other suggestions include relating the size of the blocking minority to a
population threshold or raising the number of votes required to 25.
The full cabinet is expected this morning to endorse the government's tough
negotiating line after a report from Mr Douglas Hurd on Tuesday's
inconclusive meeting of the foreign affairs council in Brussels.
The foreign secretary, who has looked uncomfortable with Britain's hardline
stance, will set out the parameters for any compromise in a speech on Europe
at the annual spring Conservative Central Council in Plymouth tomorrow.
Later in the day he will fly to Athens for the meeting of EU foreign
ministers.
At Westminster, the delight in the Tory Euro-sceptic camp at Mr Major's
stance appeared to have spread to much of the parliamentary party.
Government whips claimed the prime minister's tough words earlier this week
were supported by 90 per cent of Conservative MPs.
But the sceptics' applause was tinged with contempt as to the motives behind
Mr Major's startling change of tone. One leading Euro-sceptic said the prime
minister had been 'speaking from the bottom of the chief whip's heart'. The
number of votes to block decisions would not be 23 in a year's time, he
predicted.
Pro-European Tories continued to warn of a serious outbreak of internal
party strife if Britain did delay enlargement.

FT  24 MAR 94 / Lyell resists 'scapegoat' role in arms affair
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Nicholas Lyell, the attorney-general, last night launched a dramatic
effort to defend his role in the political furore over arms-related sales to
Iraq by insisting he would not be a 'scapegoat' in the affair.
In a series of television interviews before his appearance today at the
inquiry headed by Lord Justice Scott, Sir Nicholas vigorously defended his
role in seeking to prevent critical Whitehall documents being released to a
trial of three businessmen.
Sir Nicholas admitted in an interview with ITN that he had at one stage
considered resigning, but said he had rejected the idea. 'If I thought I had
done something wrong at the outset, that would have been the time to have
resigned - when the case collapsed. I thought about that carefully at the
time,' he said. But his appearance on television just ahead of evidence to
the Scott inquiry underlined the serious threat the affair poses to the
attorney-general's political future.
'I hope not to be the fall guy because I believe in justice and I believe I
advised carefully,' Sir Nicholas said. He added: 'I certainly don't believe
I am beleaguered by colleagues.'
In his interview with the BBC, he said: 'I don't believe in scapegoats, and
I am confident that what I did was right and fair and carefully done.'
Sir Nicholas has been under intense pressure since Mr Michael Heseltine, the
trade and industry secretary, told the inquiry earlier this month that he
had strongly resisted an instruction from the attorney-general to withhold
documents from the Matrix Chirchill trial.
Mr Heseltine and three other ministers eventually signed the so-called
public interest immunity certificates. But Sir Nicholas's judgment in
issuing the instruction has been strongly criticised by leading legal
authorities.
The attorney-general said last night that he had 'nothing against Mr
Heseltine at all'.
He said: 'I quite understand that from different perspectives, people see
things differently.' But he added: 'I gave him careful written advice.'
Sir Nicholas defended himself against the idea that, as attorney-general, he
had taken a party political view in the whole affair.
'When it comes to prosecutions, party politics has nothing to do with it
whatsoever. That is the job of attorneys-general down the centuries,' he
said.
'They have been criticised down the centuries. We have been like lighthouses
in a storm for a very, very long time. I am proud to be there and I intend
to stand like a lighthouse.'
Sir Nicholas said there were 'real lessons' to be learned from the affair.
'I look forward to getting across to the world this complete and utter myth
about me and about all the perfectly responsible ministers who signed these
certificates,' he said.

FT  24 MAR 94 / US banks lift cost of loans after Fed move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS and PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Many of the largest US banks - including Chase Manhattan, Chemical and
Citicorp - raised their prime rate from 6 per cent to 6.25 per cent
yesterday, the first general increase in bank lending rates for four years.
Their move followed the 0.25 percentage point increase in short-term
interest rates signalled by the Federal Reserve on Tuesday.
The prime rate is used to determine the rate charged on many business and
consumer loans.
In the markets, the Dow Jones industrial average closed 16.69 higher at
3,879.24, while the long bond fell half a point on the day, reflecting
profit-taking after Tuesday's late rally and a surge in commodity prices.
Even though the Fed move was followed by yesterday's cut of 8 basis points
in the German repo rate, the dollar failed to gain against the D-Mark. The
US currency closed in London at DM1.685 from its Tuesday close of DM1.6885,
and eased further to DM1.6815 in New York. European markets were mainly
influenced by events in Germany, with shares climbing in Frankfurt on the
cut in the repo rate.
The Dax index closed 19.79 points ahead at 2,161.13. But European bourses
later fell on fears that the German M3 money supply figures for February
might show an annualised rise of as much as 30 per cent. The Eurotrack 100
rose 6.98 points on the day to close at 1,445.46.
The interest rate increases reflected an attempt by the US banks to maintain
their lending margins, which stand at historically high levels.

FT  24 MAR 94 / Markets shrug off tightening by Fed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Financial markets yesterday shrugged off Tuesday's Federal Reserve's 0.25
per cent increase in short-term interest rates. The Fed's first move to
tighten monetary policy, announced on February 4, had prompted widespread
falls in bond and share prices, writes Philip Coggan.
But the latest move, which raised US short-term interest rates to 3.5 per
cent, was widely expected, and seen as ending the recent uncertainty. By 1pm
New York time yesterday, the Dow Jones industral average was 18.71 higher at
3,881.26, while the long bond was up a quarter of a point.
Even though the Fed announcement was followed by yesterday's cut of eight
basis points in the German repo rate, the dollar failed to gain against the
D-Mark. In London trading, the dollar closed at DM1.685, down from its
Tuesday close of DM1.6885. European markets were mainly influenced by events
in Germany, with shares climbing in Frankfurt on the cut in the repo rate.
The Dax index closed 19.79 points ahead at 2,161.13. But later in the day,
European bourses fell on fears that the German M3 money supply figures for
February might show an annualised rise of as much as 30 per cent. the
Eurotrack 100 rose 6.98 points, or 0.49 per cent, on the day, to close at
1,445.46.

<TEXT>
GEA, the Ruhr-based German energy, environmental and process technology
group, yesterday revealed details of its planned capital increase, intended
to raise some DM370m (Dollars 218m) in extra finance for the rapidly
expanding enterprise.
The share issue will increase the company's basic capital stock of DM150m by
a nominal DM40m, or more than 26 per cent, with the issue of 400,000 new
voting shares, and the same number of preference shares.
The shares will be offered to shareholders at a ratio of 4:1, and be managed
by Commerzbank and CS First Boston.
The company, based in Bochum, was family-owned until it went public with a
DM775m share issue in 1989. It made its name in thermal and energy
technology, expanding into air treatment and refrigeration, with the
acquisition in 1992 of the Dutch group Grasso, and food and process
engineering, with the purchase last year of Niro, in Denmark.
Mr Volker Hannemann, the chief executive, said that at least one purchase
was planned in 1994.
'We are working on a number of projects both inside and outside Germany,' he
said.

FT  23 MAR 94 / International Company News: Georg Fischer stays in the red
as sales fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Georg Fischer, the Swiss foundries and diversified engineering group, has
reported a 1993 loss of SFr34m (Dollars 24.3m), in line with a forecast made
last September, compared with a depressed profit of SFr11m in 1992.
The directors are recommending that the dividend be passed for the second
consecutive year, but they indicated that the group should make a modest
profit this year.
Fischer, which is heavily dependent on the motor industry, said its sales
fell 15 per cent to SFr2.02bn, mostly because of divestments.
Trading profits fell 38 per cent to SFr46m because of the lower sales and
squeezed margins.
The automotive products group, making castings and components for the motor
industry, was the only one to make a profit in 1993.
The machine tool division was slimmed down following the closure of the
Burkhard und Weber unit.
Mr Martin Huber, the chief executive, said that new orders were up 12 per
cent so far this year. The piping systems division should return to the
black this year and the plant engineering division should break even.

the others fell in the border area. The rockets caused no casualties. No

FT  23 MAR 94 / Nigeria cancels land deals
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   LAGOS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Nigeria's military regime has cancelled last year's allocations of land to
top members of the government, in an effort to prove it is dealing with
corruption at all levels of officialdom.
Gen Sani Abacha, head of state, and his number two, Lt-Gen Oladipo Diya,
were among 130 prominent Nigerians including cabinet ministers and top
military officers allocated plots of prime land for less than one-tenth of
their market value by former president Gen Ibrahim Babangida after he
annulled last June's presidential elections.
When the private property developers who claim to own the land took legal
action, the government tried to justify the move last September by producing
a backdated decree which, in turn, threatened all land tenure on Nigeria's
coastal land. The trial was due to come before the high court on April 26.
'It is not clear who will repay the money for the plots or whether they are
withdrawing from next month's court case,' a spokesman for the developer
said yesterday.
The land scandal has damaged the claim by Gen Abacha, who seized power in
November, to root out the corruption of the Babangida regime. Information
minister Jerry Gana intends next month to launch a 'war against indiscipline
and corruption'.
The government plans to investigate the oil and other state industries, the
central bank, the judiciary and the police, but not the armed forces.

FT  23 MAR 94 / Kazakhs deny Russia gas and oil stakes: Nazarbayev wants
pipeline to go ahead through Turkey
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRYSTIA FREELAND and ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan yesterday said his country
would not give Russia equity stakes in either the Tengiz oil project or the
Karachaganak gas field being developed in Kazakhstan by western companies.
Russia, which controls the export routes for the two developments, has been
insisting on equity in the fields rather than being paid a tariff.
'Russia will not get an equity share in Tengiz or Karachaganak,' Mr
Nazarbayev said yesterday. He added that on March 28 he was due to meet
Russian leaders in Moscow to discuss these and other economic disputes
between the two republics.
Mr Nazarbayev's statements contradict the views of western businessmen in
Alma Ata who believe Kazakhstan is on the verge of conceding equity in the
two fields to Russia. Tengiz, which is being developed by Chevron of the US,
is producing oil for export. But Chevron has been plagued by disputes with
Russia over the effect on pipelines of contaminants in the oil and the route
of new pipelines.
Karachaganak, which is some way from the export stage, is being developed by
British Gas and Agip of Italy. They have been watching Chevron's troubles
closely.
Mr Nazarbayev said yesterday that Kazakhstan was serious about plans to
construct an export pipeline south through Turkey. But this would only be
built after a joint Russian-Kazakh project to build a pipeline from the
Caspian to a Russian port on the Black Sea.
Together, Mr Nazarbayev's statements indicate an increasing determination on
the part of the Kazakh leadership to lessen the ties which have permitted
Russia to exert its economic domination.
Kazakhstan has complained that many Russian refineries, upon which it is
dependent, refused during the recent severe winter to ship back refined
products to Kazakh suppliers of crude oil. Russian buyers of Kazakh coal
were also late in making payments.
Mr Nazarbayev, who, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, was one of the
most ardent backers of closer integration among former Soviet republics, is
taking a more independent line now that 'co-operation' is taking the form of
Russian domination.
He was furious when the country was ejected from the rouble zone last
autumn. Yesterday he rejected the notion of recreating the zone, describing
it as 'a deluded dream'. Mr Nazarbayev also opposed deployment of
Russian-only peacekeeping forces in troubled former Soviet republics.
He warned of hardline tendencies in Moscow and said the time had come for
Russians to reconcile themselves to the existence of truely independent
neighbours - a process he believes is only beginning.
'There are certainly some political overtones (in Russia's economic
treatment of Kazakhstan),' Mr Nazarbayev said. 'These are growing pains. We
are just now beginning to learn how to treat each other as fully sovereign,
independent states.'
Russia has reached agreement with Azerbaijan to grant a 10 per cent stake in
a multi-billion dollar oil deal in the Caspian Sea to Lukoil, Russia's
largest semi-independent oil company, a Lukoil spokesman in Moscow said
yesterday.
The Lukoil share will come from the 25 per cent stake in the development of
the project held by the the state oil company of Azerbaijan. A group of
western oil companies led by British Petroleum are responsible for 75 per
cent of the eventual development costs. Profits are expected to be shared
out on a basis of 80 per cent for Socar and 20 per cent for the western
group.

<TEXT>
The Italian government yesterday revealed that spending in 1994 was liable
to overshoot the budget target by L14,800bn (Dollars 8.8bn).
The estimate is based on first quarter treasury receipts which were lower
than expected as a result of the recession biting deeper. At the same time
social security spending has grown faster and the savings envisaged in the
reform of the civil service have been slow to materialise.
The budget shortfall comes during the closing stages of the election
campaign and underlines the limited options open to the next government. It
would make it extremely difficult for media magnate Silvio Berlusconi to
carry out his promise to relaunch the economy, reduce taxes and provide more
jobs.
Instead the next government will probably be forced to introduce a
corrective budget shortly after it takes office.
The 1994 budget envisages holding the budget deficit at L151,000bn,
equivalent to 8.7 per cent of GDP. On yesterday's projections the deficit
would expand to almost L160,000bn.
One area where spending has grown rapidly is pensions, and officials have
warned this week that Italy will have to accelerate its plans to raise the
pension age to 65 years. If tough measures are not taken on pension and
health spending, the total social security budget may exceed 14 per cent of
GDP.
Italy's state-dominated pension system is among the most generous in the EC
and reforms introduced last year envisage only a gradual tightening of
benefits and an extremely slow move from the current retirement ages. At
present women retire at 55 and men at 60.
The pensions budget has been complicated by the recession with large-scale
resort to early retirement agreements in order to facilitate industrial
restructuring. This year the government approved a deal covering some 6,000
employees at Fiat and earlier this month agreed to fund an early retirement
deal for the bulk of 12,000 redundant workers in Ilva, the state-controlled
steel group.
The political parties in the election campaign have all emphasised the need
to encourage private pension funds and to reduce the burden on the state.

FT  23 MAR 94 / Survey of Pharmaceuticals (12): Demand for economic
specialists - New drugs must not only be safe to use: producers must prove
to buyers that their products are clearly cost-effective, too / Drug
development costs
</HEADLINE>

Wanted: health economics specialists. Excellent pay and prospects with some
of the world's biggest corporations. Perks include travel, rubbing shoulders
to top management and a key role in the successful launching of products
with potential sales of more than Pounds 1bn a year.
This is the message that the world's big pharmaceutical companies are
putting out. One of Europe's top companies recently approached Professor
Alan Maynard of the Centre for Health Economics at York University in the UK
and asked him for the names of five PhDs it could recruit. It did not
receive the answer it wanted.
'They are just not out there,' says Professor Maynard.
The demand has arisen because the structure of the drugs industry is
changing. Where once companies sold to doctors and hospitals, they now sell
to governments, insurers and, in the US, corporations from a range of
industrial sectors. These are the organisations that actually pay for
medicines, and they are beginning to flex their buying power muscles.
For drugs companies, this means that it is no longer enough to show that a
drug is safe and works, although this is still required by regulatory bodies
such as the Washington-based Food and Drug Administration. Now the task
includes demonstrating to the payers that a drug is cost-effective too. The
discipline even has a name of its own: 'pharmacoeconomics.'
Nowhere is the importance of this new area clearer than in Australia. Since
January 1993, any drug submitted for approval there must be accompanies by
not only the results of clinical trials but an economic impact analysis.
That analysis must be based on comparisons with existing treatments. It must
cover not only the price of the drug, but the impact on spending on other
medical services and the time a patient spends occupying a hospital bed.
Sometimes, in the case of for example, elderly patients, social services
costs can be included.
The Australian scheme is still in its early days. Much has yet to be
finalised especially the question of how to have an objective measure of
patient quality of life.
But the effect on drugs companies has already been far-reaching. The
economics can be simple if a new product is only a marginal improvement on
an existing one. A comparison is made of the cost of the drug and any
differences in how long the average patient has to spend in hospital.
If however, a 'breakthrough' treatment is being submitted for approval -
often with a high price ' the drugs company has to work hard to demonstrate
conclusively that it makes economic sense.
Therefore, the bulk of the economics workload is falling on companies which
invent breakthrough drugs. These are the biggest research-based companies,
mostly US, UK and Swiss.
Glaxo of the UK, for example, already has 50 employees in the area. Anglo'US
company SmithKline Beecham has less than 10 but is recruiting rapidly.
Not surprisingly, such companies have sought to make the best use of the
investment outside Australia as well as inside. The economists work is used
in marketing where their efforts may help persuade governments and
regulatory bodies to allow a high price to be charged - provided an economic
benefit is felt elsewhere.
At Swiss company Sandoz, for example, health economics is part of the
marketing operation. It began with studies that showed that transplanting
kidneys was cheaper in the long term than dialysis. Sandoz makes Sandimmun,
an immunosuppressant used in transplant operations to cut the chances of a
new kidney being rejected.
Sales are growing rapidly, the drug is in already in the world's top 20
sellers, and the company regards its pharmacoeconomics programme as a
success. Sandoz is extending its pharmacoeconomics programme to studies on
skin disease. This could help sales of its fungal treatment Lamisil which
had sales of about SFr50m in 1992, but stockbroker James Capel forecasts
that by 1996 it will be the company's second biggest product with sales of
SFr600m a year.
Economists can also become involved at a much earlier stage of the drugs
industry development chain. At Glaxo, for example, they advise research and
development departments on the likely economic effects of proposed new
products. A decision can be made earlier over whether it is worthwhile to
continue research on a product that may not find favour in an increasingly
cost-conscious healthcare environment.
Not all the research comes from or favours the drugs industry. UK government
funded research by independent academics on the costs of treating depression
and blood cholesterol have not unconditionally pleased SmithKline Beecham,
whose new anti-depressive Seroxat promises to be one of its biggest
successes of the 1990s, and Merck, whose Mevacor and Zocor cholesterol
lowering drugs have combined sales of about Dollars 2bn a year.
The role of pharmacoeconomics in the drugs industry seems set to increase.
This kind of work and the Australian experiment have attracted the attention
of governments and other healthcare buyers around the world. Canada has
already issued draft guidelines on how to do pharmacoeconomic studies of
treatment regimes, and US healthcare organisations now demand to know the
comparative costs of competing treatments.
Budget-conscious politicians and private sector healthcare buyers will find
it hard to resist using such analyses when negotiating drug selling-prices
with the pharmaceuticals industry.

FT  23 MAR 94 / Survey of Pharmaceuticals (11): Our ideas for your
investment - Biotechnology companies are carefully choosing research areas
which have the highest appeal to potential funders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is difficult to trust anyone when trying to assess the promise of
biotechnology research and development. The reason lies in the nature of the
biotechnology industry, not as a scientific enterprise but as a
capital-raising machine.
Biotechnology is usually defined as drug development and manufacture using
living organisms rather than inanimate chemicals.
But as almost any biotechnogy company executive will eventually concede,
biotech R&amp;D in the private sector is as much a means for raising funds as
pushing the frontiers of knowledge.
How it is presented therefore, is coloured not only by the objective
standards of a peer-review scientific journal, but also by the more
old-fashioned need to persuade those with money to hand it over.
It takes at least seven years for a potential drug to go from the laboratory
bench to the market. During that period, the company must secure enough
capital to pay for salaries, clinical trials, regulatory fees and marketing.
According to Mr Steven Burrill, of San Francisco merchant bank Burrill and
Craves, the 1,400 or so companies that make up the US biotechnology industry
alone need Dollars 5bn a year to survive.
That cash comes from from venture capitalists, money and securities markets
and large pharmaceuticals companies seeking smaller partners.
Each has many demands on its cash and management resources, especially now,
when healthcare reforms around the world add a new level of uncertainty to
the business of researching and developing new drugs.
But there is much that a biotech company can do in R&amp;D management to raise
its bargaining power with the suppliers of capital. Foremost, it can choose
carefully the areas of research which appeal to investors.
In principle, it wants to research into diseases which:
have a high profile, so that a typical investor is familiar with at least
its name;
which can be treated by a relatively small number of specialists -
biotechnology companies cannot afford to have large sales teams knocking on
the doors of the western world's general practitioners.
Mr David Robinson, chief executive officer of San Diego, California, company
Ligand Pharmaceuticals, says that his company chose to work in cancer
therapy partly there are a relatively small number of treatment centres in
the US, so 'you only need a sales force of 50';
which has clear end points to a course of treatment, such as complete
recovery, rather than marginal improvement. This makes the results of
clinical trials less equivocal, which in turn is likely to shorten both the
time taken to complete the trials and the deliberations of regulatory
authorities, such as the US Food and Drug Administration.
At Cor Therapeutics of south San Francisco, work is being carried out on a
drug called 'Integrilin,' which is used to try to prevent the dangerous
complications that arise from a heart treatment called angioplasty.
'The trials are done on a 30-day time frame,' says Mr Vaughan Kailian,
president and chief executive officer. '(Assessing) Integrilin is relatively
easy because of its clear endpoints.' If the patient is more likely to
emerge from the 30 day period without life threatening complications, the
use of the drug can be deemed a success;
which affects not just the elderly - there are powerful economic and ethical
reasons for regulatory authorities to speed the approval of treatments that
affect children and people of working age.
It is widely recognised that cancer drugs progress relatively rapidly
through the approvals process, even in the face of, for example, evidence of
severe side effects.
Only a handful of illnesses meet these criteria, so it should not be
surprising that biotech companies usually work on projects aimed at treating
at least one of three conditions: Aids, heart disease and cancer.
The formula is not foolproof against the rigours of scientific research. In
the 1980s, several biotech companies began research programmes into septic
shock, a condition which meets all four of the above criteria for securing
funding.
In financial terms the research programmes were successful. Money poured
into the companies involved, and three US biotech operations, Centocor, of
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Xoma, of Berkeley, California, and Synergen of
Boulder, Colorado saw their market capitalisations rise to a combined total
of Dollars 4.5bn two years ago.
Since then, their potential septic shock drugs have met with serious
problems in clinical trials and today the three companies' combined market
capitalisation is less than Dollars 1bn.
Such setbacks are more than just a jolt for the biotech company concerned
and for potential patient beneficiaries of a successful drug.
They are used by the suppliers of biotech capital as evidence that the risks
are very high and therefore as a lever to wring concessions out of the
companies in return for that capital. The large pharmaceutical companies in
particular are keen to extract concessions in the form of increased rights
to market any drug developed.
Mr Robert Spiegel, senior vice-president of clinical research of the US
company, Schering-Plough, argues that the biotechnology companies want to
keep too much in the way of marketing rights for drugs that are still in the
early stages of research and development.
'We need to go for the innovative (in biotech companies): those products
that are going to take care of needs that haven't been covered yet,' he
says.
'That's going to be a more risky investment. And we're being told: 'Don't
expect that you can get the rewards. We expect you to make the investment
but we'll decide how much you can get in return.''
He warns that, as a consequence, 'pharmaceutical companies like ours or any
other big pharmaceutical company are going to be a lot more cautious in what
type of investments (they make).'
Some large drug companies have already scaled back their involvement in
biotechnology on the basis that the risks are simply too great.
'Why produce drugs through biotech, when you can make the compounds through
classical chemistry?' asks Mr Pierre Simon, R&amp;D director of Elf-Sanofi, the
French drugs company.
'For the next few years, we will try to mimic the products of biotechnology
through classical chemistry.'
In private, few heads of large drug companies agree with Mr Simon. They say
that in practice, investing in biotechnology companies is more than just
buying into a possible new drug.
'Biotech company employees have a dedication and enthusiasm as well as
talent and the desire to work long hours that is hard to find in a large
organisation,' concedes one. And the arguments in favour of the promise of
biotechnology R&amp;D seem slowly to be gaining the upper hand.
Ten years ago, deals between biotech companies and their big drugs company
partners usually saw the exchange of all marketing rights to biotech
research programmes for capital and a promise of royalty payments should a
drug be successful.
The formula was not popular among biotech companies for two reasons:
Much of the 'financial upside' of developing a popular medication is being
able to benefit from profit margins in manufacturing and sales.
As a drug progresses through the sequence of clinical trials towards
approval, its value increases sharply. Selling rights later, rather than
sooner, can earn a lot more money for a small company
Ms Jane Shaw, the chief operating officer of one of the few biotechnology
companies to have made it to consistent profitability, Alza of Palo Alto,
California, says that times have changed.
It used to be hard to secure a deal for anything other than a royalty
arrangement, she says, but today she can view 'royalties (as) somewhat
limiting. We can now take higher risks for higher rewards.'
The compromise is for a biotech company to sell only limited marketing
rights in return for the capital injection. Glaxo of the UK, for example,
has a five per cent stake in Gilead Sciences of California. Gilead has a
number of compounds in the late stages of development, but Glaxo has no
rights to them.
'Glaxo is sharing co-promotion rights but only in code-blockers (which are
still in the earliest stages of research),' says Mr Michael Riordan, chief
executive officer.
Biotech research and development is a battleground. One the one hand are the
small biotechnology companies which have ideas, expertise and energy but not
cash or marketing power.
On the other hand are the large cash-rich pharmaceuticals companies with
huge sales forces, yet struggling to maintain morale in the face of
healthcare reforms and job cuts.
The biotech companies want to give away as few of their ideas as possible in
return for the greatest investment they can secure. The pharmaceutical
companies want to secure as many rights - preferably global rights - in
return for a large stake and limited cash commitment.
The balance of power is shifting only slowly, and the skirmishing goes on.

FT  23 MAR 94 / Survey of Pharmaceuticals (10): Thorough preparation can cut
costs - If the manufacturer of a product can save a year in its development,
that could be equivalent to the final year's sales. For a leading compound,
that could be Dollars 400m / Clinical Trials
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Few industries operate under such stringent regulatory controls as the
pharmaceutical industry. The complexity and volume of the regulations
indicate a high cost area, one of which is clinical trials which are
expensive and time consuming.
The three phases of clinical research are the longest and most costly stages
in the development of a new drug. They take an average of four to six years,
although depending on the type of drug, they may in an extreme case require
10 years.
A single advance in efficiency can be both commercially and scientifically
beneficial. Considerable data is assembled from the trials which is
subjected to detailed statistical evaluation and medical interpretation.
Effective information technology (IT) management can be a competitive aid in
cutting high costs and helping to streamline the product development and
approval process. Companies cannot take short cuts with clinical trials, but
with well-planned IT, the risk of errors in documentation and testing can be
greatly reduced.
Today, an increasing number of the world's leading pharmaceutical companies
are looking to contract research organisations (CROs) to run part or in some
cases the whole package of clinical trials. Dr John Mills international
vice-president of Besselaar, one of the largest CROs worldwide, said there
is a 'dramatic increase' in the amount of contracting-out of clinical
trials.
'In the past couple of years we have had twice the number of proposals,'
says Dr Mills. Some companies request part service while others are
requesting the full works, he adds.
A measure of how much clinical trials cost is highlighted by Prof. Richard
Peto of the clinical trial service unit, Radcliffe Infirmary, Oxford, who is
carrying out a significant trial on 20,000 people for the effectiveness of a
cholesterol-lowering drug. The trial costing some Pounds 20m is being
equally sponsored by Roche, Merck and the MRC.
But such large sums have to be viewed in proportion - 'what is Pounds 20m
when the sales of the drug are Dollars 1bn per year?' asks Prof. Peto.
According to a spokesman at the US Pharmaceutical Manufacturers'
Association, some clinical trials in the US are now costing Dollars 35,000
per patient over a six-month period.
There have been alternatives to clinical trials. In 1989, the US Congress
created the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR) to comb
through vast databases of records accumulated by hospitals, insurers, and
government health programmes since the late 1980s. These studies are known
collectively as 'outcomes research.'
After spending nearly Dollars 200m on this type of research, AHCPR 'cannot
point to a single case in which its database studies have changed clinical
practice,' comments Prof Peto.
Many companies in the industry are hoping the International Conference on
Harmonisation (ICH) process will save a lot of time and money on clinical
trials.
There is a desire by the Japanese regulatory agency to harmonise its
requirements with those of Europe and America.
Dr Trevor Jones research and development director at Wellcome says: 'Until
now, we have had to repeat all of the stability data - storage, shelf life,
and so on. From now on, we will only do it one way. Some of it we will do in
Japan, though. The difficulty is the clinical side and it is still the case
that we have to repeat a lot of clinical work in Japan. We now have 65,
mostly clinical-related scientists in Japan to carry out the necessary Phase
III trials,' he adds.
Dr Jones says Wellcome has reorganised R&amp;D to meet global changes. A new
group set up in Wellcome called Euroclin, as a prelude to Worldclin. It has
200 staff spread geographically across Europe.
There is a large group in France with other groups in Italy, and Germany
with basic acquisition of data - 'this has been done without incentives,
such as tax relief but there are three very important advantages: to be in
touch with local clinicians; regulators; and local companies,' says Dr
Jones.
Dr Pierre Simon, research and development director of Sanofi, observes that
'you have to set high standards to get compounds into full development. We
look at strength, oral activity, duration of action, the toxicology and
genotoxicity.
'We also make sure that the molecule is metabolised in man. The drug has to
clear the bar, even if its set high,' says Dr Simon.
'When you have to organise a trial like we have for the anti-thrombotic,
Clopidogrel this is a real challenge,' he adds. 'We need a two-year study,
with 500 centres and 15,000 patients. This is difficult for a young company.
So far, we have enrolled 9,000 patients - far faster than we thought and
we've saved about six months: that's a huge boost to revenues for a large
compound.'
jAnother company that keeps a tight rein on its clinical trials preparation
is Fujisawa where Dr Hitoshi Oyasu, managing director research and
development division, comments: 'We don't like cutting out compounds from
our product pipeline, but clinical trials are costly.
'However, we now have 18 NCEs in the cycle - and that is too many.
'We look at the pre-clinical data and if there is no clinical advantages, it
gets 'killed.' We 'cut' a promising oral anti-histamine only last year,' he
adds.
The company believes that the ICH will make a difference to future clinical
trials - one day - but progress seems to be difficult at the moment.
Dr Oyasu says: 'We are trying to reduce the numbers of clinicians and
centres we use for our trials. We want to focus on those investigators who
are more reliable and deliver the data on time.
'In the past, some Japanese groups have used the clinical trials as part of
their marketing strategy - in some cases there was only one patient per
hospital. We want at least eight per hospital.'
Dr William Scott, senior vice-president exploratory and drug discovery,
Bristol-Myers Squibb, says: 'If you can save one year in development, that's
equivalent to the final year's sales.
'For a big compound, that could be Dollars 400m,' comments to Dr Scott. So
even if its costs more up front, saving time can be worth hundreds of
millions of dollars.
The problem is that the hurdles are getting higher all the time, he adds.
The regulatory process is becoming increasingly complex and demanding -
'just take the fact that you now have to do trials using active control
compounds so you can compare the new molecule against the old ones. And the
fact that regulatory authorities are asking for clinical end-points, rather
than just surrogate markers.
'Admittedly, one counter trend is in the area of life-threatening diseases
when there's no available therapy. There you can get accelerated approval
using surrogate markers. But the approval is only conditional. You can give
the drug to all that require it.'
Dr Scott adds: 'BMS did this with DDI - which we gave to 27,000 patients -
and with D4T which we gave to 9,600 patients, Taxol was also given
accelerated approval.'

FT  23 MAR 94 / Survey of Pharmaceuticals (6): Disappointment over policy
document - Peter O'Donnell examines whether the European Union is helping
European drug companies / The European drug industry, a suitable case for
treatment?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER O'DONNELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Should the European Union be helping the European drug industry - and if so,
how?
This question will echo around European capitals over the coming months,
provoked by a policy document finalised in early March by the European
Commission. But on the basis of the initial responses to the Commission's
paper, the echoes may be a little muted.
For a start, 1994 seems rather late in the day to be addressing such a
fundamental question. Over more than three decades, the attention of
legislators in Brussels and Strasbourg has focused repeatedly on different
aspects of medicines - such as marketing authorisations, patent extension,
drug promotion, or cancer research.
Now, all of a sudden, a broad industrial policy is needed, says the
Commission, since the framework within which pharmaceutical companies
operate 'has been profoundly shaken,' by rising research and development
costs, the emergence of new technologies, and the international trend
towards mergers and restructuring.
Secondly, the recommendations the Commission is making are very finely
nuanced. From the cautious title - a 'communication on the outlines of an
industrial policy' - through to the hesitant conclusions, the Commission
makes so many careful genuflections in so many different directions that the
document provides little clear lead for any kind of action.
The discussion of policy skates over a wide range of issues: industry
performance, public health policy and social security spending, research
funding, national sovereignty and subsidiarity, competitiveness and
competition.
But the Commission fails to offer any effective resolution of the tensions
it alludes to, notably between cost-containment and research funding: it
goes no further than the observation that 'the legitimate concern to limit
public expenditure must not be allowed to jeopardise the future of
pharmaceutical research in Europe.'
And most of what it prescribes is little more than anodyne 'intensification
of dialogue with the member-states' on a range of uninspiring administrative
matters such as consolidation of existing legislation, establishment of the
new European Medicines Agency, and promotion of research co-ordination.
Not surprisingly, European drug companies have not been dancing in the
streets to celebrate a new dawn for high-technology medicines. Industry
trade associations and senior company executives who have been closely
involved in the evolution of this policy outline are muttering
diplomatically about the need to study the document closely before judging
it, or they point politely to some of the positive statements that the
Commission has incorporated about the value of the industry to Europe's
economy and its citizens' health.
'It may prove to be a useful vehicle for a dialogue to develop an industrial
policy,' conceded Chris Dalton of Zeneca. There is no disguising the intense
disappointment felt throughout the research-based industry, however.
Privately, drug company managers admit that the policy document contains
much less than they had hoped for - 'this is a wasted opportunity,' one
remarked sadly after leafing through the document.
Others voice the fear that 'this is unlikely to have any influence or
produce any change.' And some talk defiantly of the policy outline 'needing
a lot more work on it.' The US companies in Europe are already writing to
the Commission to express their dissatisfaction.
The disappointment is all the more acute because the European drug industry
felt until early 1994 that it was going to come out of the exercise with a
much stronger, pro-industry document.
Following a 1991 undertaking from Commissioner Martin Bangemann to back the
industry in its battle for better public understanding, a select task force
of drug industry experts from Hoechst, Glaxo, Rhone-Poulenc, Merck, Sharp &amp;
Dohme and the Swiss firms worked with officials from the Commission's
industry affairs services all through 1993, under Bangemann's auspices, to
produce a suitable draft.
By early 1994, the document was ready. Its chief importance - certainly for
the industry - was that it addressed the most serious concern of
research-based drug companies: national controls on pricing and
reimbursement. It did not go quite as far as the drug firms wanted, but it
clearly recommended economic deregulation, with free pricing for new
products, a phasing in of more general price liberalisation, and increased
patient co-payment to move drug reimbursement further away from political
control.
Drug companies felt that at last they were to be given a weapon to battle
against discriminatory and anti-competitive national health policies. The
quid pro quo for this liberalisation was to be additional stimulation of
competition from generics and parallel imported medicines, spurred by more
comparative information for doctors and the public on drugs and drug prices.
But shortly before the full Commission was asked to endorse the Bangemann
draft, the document was ambushed by a loose coalition of member states,
generic drug companies, consumer organisations, and other Commission
services who felt that they were being rail-roaded when this text was
revealed to them at such an advanced stage of drafting.
'National health services are being asked to adapt to the needs of the drug
industry,' one outraged official commented. Spearheaded by Social Affairs
Commissioner Padraig Flynn (who is also responsible for the EU's embryonic
health policy), an intensive intra-Commission horse-trading exercise built
new provisions on health, employment and social economy considerations into
the policy outline. And it reduced to mere platitudes nearly everything that
the industry had tried carefully to build into it.
The resulting dilution satisfies no-one - except the member states, who will
now retain almost unconditionally the autonomy they prize in managing their
own health care budgets, including drug pricing and reimbursement regimes.
'We weren't looking for handouts - just for deregulation,' says Anne Polya
of Pfizer, plaintively.
But generic drug companies are not happy either. Greg Perry of the European
Generics Association criticises the lack of provision for generic companies
to prepare copy products during the last year of a product's patent term, so
that copies can be launched immediately on patent expiry - 'without this,
there is going to be no real increase in generic use,' he says.
Even the consumers find the document ultimately unhelpful. Luc Joossens, a
Brussels-based consumer spokesman on health affairs, says: 'This is now so
vague it goes nowhere.' He had been hoping for clear commitments to increase
incentives for generic prescribing and dispensing, and to provide clear and
comprehensive data on drug consumption.
Optimists within the Commission believe the document can still serve a
useful purpose by stimulating an informed discussion in the European
Parliament and in the Council of Industry Ministers of the Twelve.
'Nothing of real substance has been removed from the policy outline,'
according to Fernand Sauer of the Commission's pharmaceutical industry unit.
He believes that the agenda it sets may lead national governments to take a
fresh look at how to make the most of the asset that the drug industry
represents for Europe.
While Brussels has no competence to oblige member states to act in this
field, a discussion of this type 'may also induce them to voluntarily
eliminate any distortions of the functioning of the internal market.'

FT  23 MAR 94 / Survey of Pharmaceuticals (8): Influencing the economics of
drug provision - Extracts from the Commission's policy outline
</HEADLINE>

The policy outline says that (the European drug industry's) 'ability to
finance the research and development of therapeutically innovative
medicines, which is a condition for its long term competitiveness, in
particular seems to be relatively weak.'
Pharmaceutical spending represents an important share of social security
budgets, whose financing is a subject of concern in most member states at
the very moment that they are required to contain public deficits in order
to prepare for economic and monetary union.
The Commission will see to it that any price control system is operated in
such a way that the price setting mechanism is fully transparent and that
all forms of discrimination are prevented.
It would not be acceptable that national decisions relating to price fixing
or admission for reimbursement are influenced by the origin of products and
discriminate against products imported from other member states.
In the case of medicinal products which are available without prescription -
and which are not eligible for reimbursement by social security - it seems
that, in some member states, the market is often competitive enough to
ensure an affordable price level.
In the case of reimbursed medicinal products, it could be interesting to
consider other cost containment measures. Such methods would be based on
competition between undertakings for those therapeutic categories where
several treatments are available.
Member-states should not be forced to accept excessive pricing of medicinal
products which are not subject to competition, whilst ensuring that the
pharmaceutical industry maintains its financial capacity necessary to
support its R&amp;D activities.
The Court of Justice has on many occasions ruled that parallel imports are
legal, irrespective of the factors that determine price differences.
Prescribing doctors, if better informed about the cost/efficacy ratio of
medicinal products, will tend to prescribe generically.

FT  23 MAR 94 / Survey of Pharmaceuticals (9): A more selective approach -
Case study / Schering-Plough Research Institute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE WILKINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For US pharmaceutical companies, the impending healthcare reforms promise an
era of increased cost-containment and pricing controls. Under the weight of
such restrictive measures, how will the innovative drugs industry adapt to
survive?
According to Dr Robert Spiegel, senior vice-president clinical research at
Schering-Plough Research Institute, the market for new drugs will never
subside - 'we believe that there will always be a market and a very
profitable market for drug companies that can develop novel products that
satisfy an unmet need in an important therapeutic area,' he says.
In 1993, Schering-Plough spent USDollars 578m on research and development,
an investment which it expects to increase to over Dollars 600m this year.
Despite its continued commitment to R&amp;D funding, Schering-Plough admits that
the more cost-driven market has triggered a change of approach.
'There is a new world now that is forcing us even more to adapt our research
and development process,' says Dr Spiegel.
At Schering-Plough, most of this adaptation has been evolutionary. About
three years ago the company set up a Pharmaceutical Economic Unit designed
to assess the economic cost and quality of life benefit of potential new
drugs at the earliest possible stage.
Evaluation of exactly what Schering-Plough expects to bring to the market
when a product is fully developed is now 'a prominent part' of its core R&amp;D
process, says Dr Spiegel.
Combined with this more selective approach to R&amp;D, is the knowledge that on
the way to discovering breakthrough products, drug companies are inevitably
exposed to greater risks. This means manufacturers have to be increasingly
daring when deciding which compounds to back.
Dr Spiegel says: 'If you're only going after Alzheimer's drugs, the winner
of that in the pharmaceutical industry will have a nice pot of gold at the
end of the process, but there will be a lot more losers along the way.'
Willingness to conduct research in more high-risk areas then, is no
guarantee of commercial success. As Raul Cesan, president Schering
Laboratories suggests: 'We all want to develop something that is unique, yet
we may end up with something that is a marginal improvement.'
Development of compounds that may offer only a slightly better safety
profile over products already on the market is a luxury which research-based
drug companies can no longer afford.
In certain cases, 'that marginal improvement gives to the system exactly
what politicians and government officials want. They lower the price because
once you have two or three or four of those (products), prices collapse
immediately,' argues Raul Cesan.
Research at Schering-Plough covers six main therapeutic areas. These are:
anti-infec tives; oncology; allergy; dermatology; cardiovascular and the
central nervous system. According to Dr Spiegel, the secret of the company's
R&amp;D success lies in its balance of discovery areas. It supports both
research into 'quite comfortable' scientific fields and high risk areas 'of
great potential yield.'
He explains: 'There are times when you're in brand new areas where the
regulatory environment and clinical development environment is also unknown.
But if you're in those areas that have high potential success, it's worth
taking that risk, too.'
However, incentives to take such risks could soon disappear if the pricing
controls proposed under healthcare reform are approved - 'the proposal to
severely review the ultimate pricing of a drug, even if it's a breakthrough
product, gives a disincentive to how much risk money you would put up for
those types of activities,' warns Dr Spiegel.
In any case he believes that current market forces are taking care of price
controls within the drug industry.
In its 1993 annual report published last week, Schering-Plough announced
that between 1991 and 1993, it held average US net prescription drug price
increases to below the rate of increase in the consumer price index (CPI),
and in 1994 expects price rises again to be at or below the increase in CPI.
'Prices have been moderating dramatically,' comments Raul Cesan.
While individual companies may be suffering a loss of appetite for R&amp;D
risk-taking, the US drug industry as a whole is maintaining its commitment
to R&amp;D through teamwork.
Joint ventures and alliances between university research departments,
smaller biotechnology companies or established pharmaceutical companies show
that by pooling their resources, drug companies can continue the search for
innovative products.
In future, Dr Spiegel predicts, 'there will be more incentive to form
alliances in the research area to spread your bets, and that's certainly a
concept that we embrace.'
In its annual report, Schering-Plough says that about 25 per cent of its
research dollars were targeted for biotechnology.
Another form of alliance has seen US drug companies tap into the market of
managed care. Last year, Merck &amp; Co acquired health maintenance organisation
Medco Containment Services for Dollars 6bn, in a move widely regarded as an
attempt to protect market share.
Effectively, the acquisition changed Merck's mission from being a
research-based pharmaceutical company to a major player in the healthcare
market.
Such redefinition of company business strategy is not anticipated by
Schering-Plough. To ensure long-term survival beyond healthcare reform, the
company believes continued investment in its R&amp;D pipeline is essential.
Raul Cesan concludes: 'You have to find the very successful drugs eventually
 -otherwise you cannot survive.'

FT  23 MAR 94 / Survey of Pharmaceuticals (7): What the European Union aims
to achieve
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
According to the Commission's policy outline, the principal areas where the
European Union is creating a more favourable environment for the drug
industry are:
The European Medicines Evaluation Agency - due to come into operation from
1995 in its London base, and providing rapid access to the single market
through new product authorisation procedures:
A centralised procedure, leading to a single authorisation for the whole of
the EU reserved for certain new medicinal products and mandatory for those
derived from biotechnology.
A decentralised procedure, designed for most medicinal products, based on
mutual recognition of national marketing authorisations (with disputes to be
settled by binding EU arbitration).
The proceedure should provide faster authorisations (300 days instead of
several years), and keep down cost increases in authorisation processing.
It should also enhance consumer confidence and improve public health
protection.
It will help in due course to reduce the diversity from market to market in
information about therapeutic indications, side effects, presentation and
package size.
Recent legislation includes:
A directive on wholesale distribution of medicines will facilitate and
stimulate intra-Community trade whilst ensuring the integrity of
transactions, regulating recall of defective products, and deterring
counterfeit products.
Directives on medicines advertising, labelling and leaflets will improve
information for patients, limit waste, and impose requirements on promotion
to health professionals.
Patent protection:
A new regulation ensures intellectual property protection of up to 15 years
from the date of first marketing of a medicine in the EU.
A common position was adopted in February on the revised draft directive on
legal protection of biotechnological inventions, opening the way for
definite adoption during 1994.
A stable and safe environment for new biotechnology projects:
Co-operation between the EU and member-states should improve in order to
avoid duplication of research and development projects.
It will be necessary to bring greater attention to ethical questions
associated with certain applications of biotechnology and to enhance public
understanding.
A review of the regulatory framework in the light of advances in scientific
knowledge.
Programmes better suited to pharmaceutical research and development:
Encourage multi-disciplinary research and industry/university inter-action.
Promote integration and co-operation between pre-normative research and R&amp;D
 -as in the project Fourth Framework Programme 1994-1998, now in the final
stages of discussion.
Evolve research priorities in pharmaceutical research, via pilot projects.
