FT  18 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Davis Service advances to Pounds 21.8m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Davis Service Group, the business services company formerly known as Godfrey
Davis, saw pre-tax profits rise from Pounds 17.5m to Pounds 21.8m in 1993
though underlying trading profits were flat.
The figures were boosted by the Pounds 52m acquisition of the HSS tool hire
business from John Mowlem in May, which made a Pounds 2.9m contribution
after financing costs. The deal was funded largely by a Pounds 34.7m share
placing.
Mr John Ivey, chief executive, said that HSS had performed slightly better
than expected with demand showing some recovery in the fourth quarter. 'We
were lucky to buy it at the right time.'
Operating profits from continuing operations slipped from Pounds 19.2m to
Pounds 19m due to problems in the textile maintenance division where profits
fell Pounds 1m to Pounds 12.2m.
The workwear manufacturing business, which broke even in 1992, fell into the
red on sales of around Pounds 20m due to stiff competition from both UK and
overseas suppliers. Mr Ivey said the company was undertaking 'a detailed
review' of its manufacturing operation and declined to say whether it formed
part of the group's long-term plans.
Profits from portable building rental rose from Pounds 3.4m to Pounds 3.8m
and support services, which supplies cleaning and catering services, saw
profits jump 20 per cent to Pounds 3.7m. However this growth stemmed largely
from new contracts won at the end of 1992.
Little new work was taken on last year due to the confusion over whether the
Tupe regulations protecting employees' rights when their employer changes
hands apply to contracting out of services. The group's policy is not to
take on new public sector contracts until the position is clarified.
Mr Ivey said that HSS's profits for the year as a whole were 20 per cent up
on 1992 on turnover 13 per cent higher. The company is looking to add 20 new
branches to the HSS network this year.
Reported earnings per share rose from 14.36p to 15.49p, but adjusting for
gains and losses on disposals earnings edged up from 15p to 15.1p. Dividends
are held at 7.98p with a final of 5.25p.
COMMENT
But for the HSS acquisition, Davis's prospects would be looking distinctly
dull. There is scope for recovery in textile rental, though its markets will
not pick up in a hurry, and workwear manufacturing should be back in the
black this year but support services have been snared in the legislative
tangle over contracting out. Luckily Davis picked up HSS at just the right
time and, unlike Mowlem, can afford to invest in it. Supplying small
builders and the DIY market it has already seen demand pick up nicely and
its full year contribution could take profits to over Pounds 25m putting the
shares at 261p on a multiple of little over 15. One for the more
conservative investor.

FT  18 MAR 94 / UK Company News: GGT shares fall 55p on profits warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A second profits warning in five months from Gold Greenlees Trott, the
advertising group, yesterday prompted a 55p fall in the company's shares to
184p.
GGT also warned that it would be cutting its total dividend from 8.3p to
5.3p for the 12 months ending April 30.
The company said it was unlikely that pre-tax profits would exceed Pounds 3m
for the year. In October it said profits would exceed 1993's figure of
Pounds 4.3m, but warned that City forecasts of around Pounds 6m were
optimistic.
The company said it had adequate cash balances - averaging about Pounds 20m
 -but the directors considered it 'prudent to adjust the dividend in order
to revert to a more normal level of dividend cover'.
The final pay-out will be cut to 2p. The directors said the balance between
the interim and final dividend would be adjusted next year.
The warning in October followed lower-than-expected profits in the UK, but
GGT said then that it hoped a strong performance from the US would cushion
the impact of the shortfall.
The company said yesterday: 'It has now become clear that this will now not
happen, primarily due to the postponement of a national launch by a major
client (Coors Brewing), pending the results of a regional test market, and
higher than expected new business-related costs.'
GGT added that it remained confident in the underlying strength of its
business and had already taken steps to improve growth and profitability,
particularly in the UK.

FT  18 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Haden MacLellan calls for Pounds 13m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Haden MacLellan Holdings, the engineering group, yesterday announced a
1-for-4 rights issue to raise about Pounds 13m and 1993 pre-tax profits up
from Pounds 4.3m to Pounds 4.5m.
Haden, with interests including paint finishing systems for the automotive
industry and distribution of industrial fasteners and machine tools, wants
to strengthen its finances to fund organic growth opportunities.
Turnover rose from Pounds 294.2m, including Pounds 18.2m from discontinued
activities, to Pounds 309.6m. A lower tax charge of Pounds 1.5m (Pounds
2.1m) left earnings per share at 3.5p (2.6p) and the proposed final dividend
is held at 1p, making an unchanged 2p for the year.
Mr Harold Cottam, chairman, said the strategic review which he initiated
after joining the group in 1992 had established the way forward for the
company, and the latest results showed it had achieved its first and most
immediate objective of stabilising earnings.
Process engineering and services lifted profits from Pounds 2.6m to Pounds
3.2m, reflecting a turnround from a loss of Pounds 3.4m to profit of Pounds
1.5m in its restructured North American business. However there was a
deeper-than-expected downturn in Europe and a Pounds 500,000 provision for
closing the Spanish operation.
In manufacturing and distribution, profits dropped from Pounds 4m to Pounds
2.8m. Manufacturing dropped to Pounds 600,000 (Pounds 1.8m), reflecting
Pounds 1m of reorganisation costs, and distribution was unchanged at Pounds
2.2m with a good performance in industrial fasteners - identified as a core
busienss for future growth - offset by a downturn on the machine tool side.
The rights issue is priced at 62p per share, compared with yesterday's
closing price of 78p, down 2p, and is fully underwritten by Schroders. De
Zoete &amp; Bevan are brokers to the issue. Mr Cottam said the issue would be
broadly neutral for shareholders and had received strong support from
institutions.
COMMENT
A modest rights issue makes a good deal of sense. Net cash has fallen from
about Pounds 18m at the end of 1991 to a negative Pounds 11.6m in line with
the virtual disappearance of advanced payments and even, on occasions,
phased payments, in contracting. Yet without the money, topped up over the
next few months, perhaps, by about Pounds 7m from selling the Duport foundry
business, Haden would clearly be unable to exploit the opportunities from
its global leadership in paint finishing systems. Nor would it be able to
take full advantage of the reorganisation and refocusing of the past 18
months. Shareholders will be encouraged by the company's intention to resume
dividend growth once appropriate cover has been achieved, and, with a modest
rise in profits this year as business picks up in the second half, the
prospective p/e is between 15 and 16, based on the current shares.

Mount Edon Gold Mines has, for the third time been denied by the Australian
courts in its opposition to the recommended takeover of Europa Minerals, the
mining finance house in which it has a 19.9 per cent stake, by Burmine, an

Mount Edon is trying to scotch what is in effect a three-way merger between

affirmed the decision of the independent scrutineer to disregard the votes
cast by Mount Edon and its associates on resolution 6 at the Burmine

FT  18 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Courtaulds Textiles' flat Pounds 39m
pleases City
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Courtaulds Textiles climbed 5p to 568p after fears of a sharp fall
in profits at the clothing and fabrics group failed to materialise.
The group, which three months ago saw its shares fall 10 per cent to 489p
following a profits warning, yesterday reported flat pre-tax profits of
Pounds 38.8m (Pounds 39.1m) for the year to December 31.
Although hit by volatile consumer demand and continued recession in
continental Europe, turnover increased by 3.8 per cent to Pounds 923.1m
(Pounds 889.6m) and operating profits rose marginally to Pounds 49.5m
(Pounds 49.3m).
Expressing confidence in its future prospects, the group is proposing a
final dividend of 9.5p (9.2p) to lift the total for the year to 14.2p
(13.6p).
Earnings per share, however, fell from a restated 30.1p to 29.2p.
Mr Noel Jervis, chief executive, said the company would have reported
increased pre-tax profits had it not decided to abandon its policy of
offsetting interest charges by taking a pension credit through the profit
and loss account.
Last year the company reduced the pension credit - part of a surplus built
up on the group's pension fund - to Pounds 1.3m (Pounds 4.8m) and warned of
no further credit payments.
This led to a sharp increase in net interest payable to Pounds 4.2m (Pounds
1.8m) on unchanged year-end borrowings of Pounds 17.7m.
Of the group's five divisions, branded clothing suffered the sharpest
decline as operating profits fell to Pounds 600,000 (Pounds 5.9m) despite
increased turnover of Pounds 195.1m (Pounds 193.6m).
Mr Jervis blamed the downturn on operational problems at its Aristoc factory
in the Midlands, which makes hosiery for retailers such as Marks and
Spencer, and large stock write-downs at Georges Rech, its French underwear
business.
The fabrics division saw profits fall to Pounds 19.9m (Pounds 22.1m) as
margins in Europe were hit by falling prices, which wiped out improved
performances in Britain and the US.
Reduced profits in the two divisions were offset by gains in home
furnishings, spinning and own-label clothing, with the latter business
reporting the largest rise to Pounds 16.3m (Pounds 10.9m).
COMMENT
Having forecast bad news last December, Courtaulds Textiles' flat
performance came as a pleasant surprise. Although there are still problems
to be ironed out in its fabrics business, increased reorganisation costs of
Pounds 7.6m (Pounds 6.8m) signalled its intention to further restructure any
operations making unsatisfactory returns. Having spent more than Pounds 41m
on acquisitions, it is also expected to emerge as a group with a strong
international presence and highly regarded products. That prospect is
reflected in forecast profits of up to Pounds 48m which, on a forward
multiple of 15.9, make the group a moderately attractive option.

FT  18 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Pochin's halved to Pounds 0.8m but interim
held
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits at Pochin's, the building, plant hire and property group,
were halved from a restated Pounds 1.6m to Pounds 836,000 in the six months
to end November.
However, Mr Nicholas Pochin, chairman, said that the result was an advance
on the second half of last year and that both profits and turnover for those
12 months had been 'inflated by a large design and build project'.
Mr Pochin said he thought 'a fragile recovery' in the industry had started.
He added that although there was no consistent pattern, Pochin's had
recently been more successful in gaining work and the forward order book was
'reasonable'.
Earnings per share were cut to 56.2p (110.5p) but the interim dividend is
held at 8p. Turnover on continuing activities fell to Pounds 15.3m (Pounds
24.4m) - all the corresponding figures are restated - and there was a Pounds
338,000 (nil) contribution from acquisitions.
At the operating level, there were losses of Pounds 2,000 (profits Pounds
899,000). Other income edged ahead to Pounds 1m (Pounds 939,000) and
interest payable eased to Pounds 168,000 (Pounds 234,000).

<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The London Stock Exchange has reprimanded and imposed a IPounds 150,000
(Pounds 144,000) fine on J&amp;E Davy Stockbrokers, Dublin's largest firm of
brokers.
The moves followed a protracted enquiry into the placing last April of the
Irish government's 30.4 per cent stake in Greencore, the sugar, milling and
malting group.
In a brief statement the London Stock Exchange said Davy's conduct in the
placing 'was, in some respects, detrimental to the interests of the Stock
Exchange'.
It gave no further details of which rules it judged had been infringed by
the Dublin firm.
The IPounds 68m placing came close to being a debacle when it transpired
that Davy had entered into a profit or loss sharing agreement with SG
Warburg in London as a buyer of last resort for 10m of the shares.
On the day of the placing, however, Davy unwound this arrangement and
instead sold 7m of the shares to firms connected with Davy without informing
the market.
Several large institutional investors then pulled out of the placing, and it
was only rescued when the Bank of Ireland, which owns 90 per cent of Davy,
stepped in to buy 9.6m shares at a cost of IPounds 26m.
Trading in Greencore shares had to be suspended for several days following a
ruling from the Irish stock exchange that the market was trading 'on
misleading information'.

FT  18 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Imry buys Pounds 118m property portfolio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Imry Holdings, the property company taken over by Barclays, the clearing
bank, in December 1992, has acquired a Pounds 117.9m property portfolio from
Timberlaine, a subsidiary of General Accident.
The portfolio consists of 1.7m sq ft of space in the south-east of England,
mainly in Hampshire and Surrey.
Imry said the deal gave it a portfolio of 'scope and quality', which
complemented its existing investment and trading portfolio. The deal was
financed by debt provided by GE Capital and equity from its own resources.
General Accident said the deal gave it the opportunity to rationalise its
overall property holdings and concentrate on new investment areas.
About 28 per cent of the portfolio is unlet, mostly in new buildings. About
Pounds 5.9m of the purchase price relates to development sites, particularly
in Southampton and Bristol. The portfolio consists of 42 per cent offices,
32 per cent industrial and warehouses and 24 per cent retail.
Barclay's involvement in Imry began in 1989 when it financed a
highly-leveraged takeover of the company. Imry has said that it expects to
be floated or reversed into a quoted company.

FT  18 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Kwik-Fit advances by 49%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Property sales, cost cutting and aggressive marketing helped Kwik-Fit
Holdings, the tyre, exhaust and brakes fitter, lift full year pre-tax
profits by 49 per cent.
Pre-tax profits in the year to February 28 increased to Pounds 25.4m,
against Pounds 17.1m, on turnover which grew by 11 per cent to Pounds 260.1m
(Pounds 233.6m.) The profit figures included net property profits of Pounds
4.08m (Pounds 3.74m).
Earnings per share increased by 47 per cent to 10.39p (7.06p) and a final
dividend of 2.3p (2p) is recommended making a total for the year up 13.4 per
cent to 3.8p (3.35p). The shares closed 11p up at 167 1/2 p.
Operating profits advanced 51 per cent to Pounds 23.1m (Pounds 15.3m),
reflecting the benefits of higher volumes and reductions in the underlying
cost base.
At the year-end Kwik-Fit was operating through 626 retail centres, up from
610 a year earlier. This included 125 in Holland and Belgium and 10 in
Ireland.
Mr Tom Farmer, chairman, said UK sales and profit growth were achieved
'against very demanding conditions'. Operating profits increased 35 per cent
to Pounds 18m on turnover up 9 per cent at Pounds 202m.
The group launched a cut-price tyres campaign in November aimed at boosting
volumes and market share. As a result it claimed its share of the
replacement tyre market jumped by four percentage points to 18 per cent and
overall sales for the year grew by 10 per cent to Pounds 108.3m.
Exhaust sales grew by 4 per cent to Pounds 63.1m while revenues from the new
nationwide brake fitting business grew by 40 per cent to Pounds 9.5m.
Overseas operations contributed Pounds 5.1m (Pounds 2m) to profits on
turnover which increased by 19 per cent to Pounds 58.1m (Pounds 49m).
Net interest costs fell to Pounds 1.77m (Pounds 1.96m) and the group ended
the period with Pounds 20.7m (Pounds 100,000) of net cash.
COMMENT
Kwik-Fit's business is growing again, but the group faces an uphill slog to
get back to its peak profit performance. Profits last year were helped by
property sales, the recovery of the Dutch operations and cost reductions
which will be difficult to repeat. The decision to go for volume and market
share in the replacement tyre market means margins, which were already under
pressure because of the shift in sales mix, will be lower. The move into the
brake repair and replacement market could enable the group to make better
use of its fixed cost base, but Kwik-Fit has yet to demonstrate that it can
win a sizeable share of the market. Pre-tax profits this year should be
about Pounds 23.5m, producing earnings of 9.6p. The shares are trading on a
forward multiple of 17.4 and look fairly valued.

FT  18 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Pounds 121m restructuring costs hit UB
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
United Biscuits' full year profits before exceptionals were up 6 per cent
before tax at Pounds 181.8m, in what the company said was a year of
progress. However, the figures were marred by reorganisation costs totalling
Pounds 121.3m, and profit falls in UB's central business of UK biscuits and
snacks.
The restructuring costs fall mostly on UB's troubled US subsidiary Keebler.
Including provisions already announced of Pounds 11.2m for the closure of a
snack plant at Raleigh, North Carolina, the total US cost will come to
Pounds 92.5m.
In the UK and Europe costs will be Pounds 28.8m, of which Pounds 4m will be
spent on closing a plant in Hungary and the rest chiefly on redundancies,
especially in middle management.
Before exceptionals, profits in UK biscuits were down 10 per cent at Pounds
83.8m, while UK snack profits were down 4 per cent at Pounds 34.8m. Biscuit
profits overseas were up 10 per cent at Pounds 21m.
Snack profits in Europe were up 49 per cent at Pounds 12.8m, while snack
profits in the Asia Pacific region, helped by last year's acquisition of
Smith's in Australia, went from an Pounds 0.7m loss to a Pounds 15.5m
profit.
Ross Young's, the UK frozen foods business, increased profits by 7 per cent
to Pounds 30.4m.
At Keebler, profits before exceptionals were up 51 per cent to Pounds 40.1m.
In dollar terms, profits of Dollars 64m were still well below the 1991 peak
of Dollars 120m. Mr Eric Nicoli, chief executive, said Keebler's dollar
profits were up 55 per cent in the secondhalf.
Volume sales of biscuits in the US had fallen substantially last year, he
said. However, studies UB had undertaken as part of its rationalisation
programme did not envisage volume falling further,
Group sales were up 10 per cent at Pounds 3.45bn. Overseas sales were 55 per
cent of the total, compared to 52 per cent the year before. Exceptional
charges totalled Pounds 65.1m, with the reorganisation costs partly offset
by Pounds 47.6m profits on disposals, chiefly the UK confectioner Terry's.
After reorganisation costs, pre-tax profit was down 28 per cent at Pounds
116.7m. Earnings per share before exceptionals were up 4 per cent at 24.2p.
After exceptionals, earnings were 12.8p, leaving an unchanged dividend of
15.3p for the year only 84 per cent covered. UB said its intention was to
rebuild dividend cover to two times.
UB said there were encouraging signs for trading in the current year, though
all its main markets remained highly competitive.

FT  18 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Float will value Nottingham at Pounds 81.4m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nottingham Group, one of the UK's largest suppliers of educational products,
is to raise Pounds 13.6m from a flotation, which will value the company at
Pounds 81.4m.
Nottingham is to offer 24.5m shares at 155p each, of which 16.1m will be
placed firm with institutions and 8.4m will be sold through an
intermediaries offer.
The company made pre-tax profits of Pounds 7.3m in 1993 after a Pounds 1.1m
write-off on fixed assets. Based on earnings excluding the write-off, the
shares are being listed on an historic p/e of 14.2 and a notional yield of
4.45 per cent.
About 67 per cent of 1993 turnover was in sales to primary and secondary
schools. Nottingham hopes that utilisation of the state schools' estimated
Pounds 400m budget surplus will help fuel sales growth.
The Pounds 38m share offer is sponsored by Goldman Sachs, broker to the deal
along with James Capel. Nottingham is issuing 9m new shares, a further
600,000 will result from conversion of preference shares, while 15.5m
existing shares will also be offered.
Following flotation, the directors will control 15 per cent of Nottingham,
having sold 25 per cent, and existing institutional shareholders will own 33
per cent.
The cash raised will be used to redeem outstanding preference shares.
Dealings will begin on March 30.
COMMENT
There are no listed companies that can offer a direct comparison with
Nottingham, but on the basis of its generous dividend yield and a p/e at a
substantial discount to the market average, the shares should offer
something for the stags. The company is strongly cash generative, enabling
it to fund further small acquisitions to build up its distribution network.
This should provide some further lift for a solid but unexciting business.

FT  18 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Reed Elsevier restructure will reduce audit
fees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Reed Elsevier, the international publishing group, plans to reduce its audit
fees by nearly two-fifths as a result of a restructuring of its operations
which has led to the appointment of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu as worldwide
auditors.
It also aims to reduce the number of legal entities registered in the UK by
three-quarters as part of the process in an effort to reduce the number and
costs of statutory audits.
The fees of Reed, Elsevier and Reed Elsevier, their joint venture, are
expected to fall from about Pounds 2.1m to Pounds 1.3m as a result of an
audit tender for which all the largest six accountancy firms competed.
Mr Nigel Stapleton, a director of Reed International, said: 'We did not make
the decision on who came with the lowest fee, although price was obviously
an important consideration.'
He said the reduction reflected the elimination of duplication from having
two firms of auditors as a result of the merger, as well as improvements to
internal audit and changes in the structure of the company.
He stressed that the audit tender prices from all the firms were very close
to each other. 'We want a challenging audit, not the firm that will give us
the easiest audit,' he said.
The process began in June last year, and by October three firms remained for
detailed selection: Touche, Price Waterhouse, current auditor to Reed, and
Coopers, auditor to Elsevier until now.

FT  18 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Museums block Norton'sstrategy for a
kick-start
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Attempts to kick-start the Norton motorcycle company by raising much-needed
cash from the sale of 10 vintage motorcycles appeared close to breakdown
yesterday.
Lawyers acting for three British museums where the motorcycles have been on
display - some of them for more than 50 years - have halted moves to return
them to Norton Motors (1993), a Canadian-backed company which bought the
famous manufacturer last year.
The move is a blow for Norton, which had asked Sotheby's sell the fleet next
month as part of its strategy to realise capital to restart production.
Yesterday, however, curators at London's Science Museum, the National Motor
Museum and the Museum of British Road Transport said they would not part
with the vehicles, including an 1898 Ariel tricycle and 1905 Matchless,
unless the company could prove its ownership.
Mr David MacDonald, Norton's former chief executive, has written to the
curators warning them that the company has no rights to the motorcycles.
Norton has merged and changed hands several times since the motorcycles were
loaned to the museums, and it could prove impossible to unravel which
company now owns them.
The Science Museum said yesterday: 'We're waiting for Norton to prove
ownership. The matter is with our solicitors.'
Norton, which has also called in its lawyers, said it remained confident it
could sell the bikes.

FT  18 MAR 94 / UK Company News: OGC beats expectations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OGC, the oil services group of which 40 per cent was floated last year by
Fairhaven International, reported a better-than-expected 7 per cent increase
in 1993 pre-tax profits from Pounds 10.5m to Pounds 11.2m on sales 4.2 per
cent lower at Pounds 217.1m, against Pounds 226.6m.
The Bermuda-registered parent, owned by Mr Fred Olsen, the Norwegian
shipping magnate, also announced a sharp jump in profits from Dollars 18.1m
to Dollars 38.6m (Pounds 26.4m). That was largely due to the Pounds 30m
proceeds of floating OGC.
Sales were 12 per cent down at Dollars 461.9m (Dollars 524.4m). Since the
flotation Fairhaven has become largely an investment vehicle
Investors, who took up OGC's shares at 130p in June, were rewarded with a
proposed final dividend of 3.5p, for a total of 5.25p. This compares with a
notional net pay-out of 4.4p, and is more than twice covered by earnings of
11.9p (10.9p). The shares closed yesterday 6p higher at 155p.
Mr Richard Wilson, the chairman, said that while sales had been expected to
decline, the year had remained 'particularly busy'.
Most of the profits were due to the Aberdeen-based AOC, which provides
services to North Sea projects. Several contracts came to an end during the
year, allowing OGC to recognise the full profits.
Fairhaven enjoyed a less successful year, however, showing a 9 per cent
decline in profits before exceptional items. The Pounds 30.2m exceptional
gain from the flotation of OGC was offset by an Pounds 8m charge arising
from litigation in the US.
Mr James Davidson, chairman, said significant amounts due to Fairhaven were
the subject of litigation in the US. 'While we believe that these matters
will be resolved in our favour, hopefully in 1994, this is not certain.' The
litigation had been expected to be resolved last year.
On a brighter note, Mr Davidson said margins and sales had been better than
expected and in line with those of 1992. However, the company was hit by
adverse exchange rates, following the devaluation of sterling.
The main contributor to profits was the holding in OGC. Belmont Constructors
performed below expectations while the partnership with Nishika returned a
loss.
The final dividend of 1.3 cents (0.6 cents) is proposed for a total of 1.8
cents (0.8 cents). Earnings per share rose from 4.39 cents to 12.75 cents.

Shares in Applied Distribution, the contract distribution group, closed at

This values the company, formed five years ago under a Pounds 16.5m
management buy-out from Geest, at more than Pounds 42m.
Of the 17.25m shares placed, representing 57 per cent of the enlarged
capital, 11.35m were newly issued. The balance of 5.9m shares were sold by
existing shareholders.
About 1.5m shares changed hands yesterday. Barings, the sponsor, described
the trading as 'a very satisfactory start.'

FT  18 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Fraser float price set at lowly 180p
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
House of Fraser, the 56-store department chain being floated by its owners,
the Fayed brothers, yesterday set its flotation price at 180p.
That valued the group at a lower-than-expected Pounds 413.3m.
The price was at the bottom end of forecasts, which ranged between 180p and
220p, and puts the shares on an historic p/e of 16.2 times.
A dividend of 5p that would have been recommended last year would give a
gross yield of 3.5 per cent.
Since publication of the House of Fraser pathfinder prospectus most analysts
had predicted a price of between 190p and 200p. However, recent volatility
in the stock market is thought to have persuaded SG Warburg, which is
handling the flotation, to plump for a lower price.
COMMENT
By fixing the price at 180p, House of Fraser has effectively neutralised the
market's reservations, and the shares look attractive. The recent tightening
of planning restrictions on retail developments means opportunities for
opening new stores will be limited. But there is considerable room for
improving sales from the group's very cheap, mainly freehold, existing
selling space as the new management refurbishes the stores, improves the
range and introduces new systems. The historic multiple of 16.2 times is a
16 per cent discount to the stores sector. On forecasts of Pounds 43m for
this year, the discount falls to about 11 per cent, but the management needs
to provide more evidence of its expertise if the shares are to move to a
market rating.

Pounds 5.8m
</HEADLINE>

   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Trade Indemnity Group, the credit insurer, reported a return to profit in
1993 and a positive view of the current year. The shares rose 4p to 94p.
The company is forecasting business failures, as reported by its customers,
will fall 10 per cent during 1994, following a 26 per cent drop to 6,303
(8,470) last year.
TIG, which is 77 per cent owned by a group of leading European insurance
companies, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 5.8m (losses of Pounds 4.9m).
The proposed final dividend is 0.5p, its first payment since 1990. Earnings
per share were 4.5p (losses 1p).
Gross premium income from continuing operations fell marginally to Pounds
145m (Pounds 147m), reflecting a decline in customers' sales levels.
Mr Vic Jacob, managing director, said premium income increased significantly
in the second half, and had continued to grow in 1994. There was also a 24
per cent increase in UK export insurance business.
Net claims paid fell 17 per cent to Pounds 48.2m, enabling a release of
Pounds 1.7m to be made to the profit and loss account.

FT  18 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Blenheim pays Pounds 17m for three
acquisitions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Blenheim Group, the exhibitions organiser whose shares have almost halved
over the past year, has made three acquisitions for a minimum Pounds 17m in
cash.
They include its first purchase in east Asia, a fast-growing exhibitions
market where it has little presence.
The first buy involves a complicated restructuring of France's giftware and
interior decoration exhibitions. Blenheim, which has two small exhibitions
in the sector, is buying the rival MIC exhibition for FFr30m (Pounds 3.5m)
and injecting all three into the market leader, the Paris Ateliers d'Arts
Show, which is owned by a trade association.
Blenheim is also commiting a further FFr30m in cash in return for a 50 per
cent stake in the joint company.
Mr Christopher Crowcroft, finance director, said that the smaller
exhibitions had suffered from the recession and the industry did not like
the competing shows. Mr Crowcroft said the deal would enhance Blenheim's
earnings this year.
Blenheim has also agreed to pay L22.6bn (Pounds 9m) for Editoriale PEG, an
Italian publisher of technical magazines covering heating, plumbing and
sanitation. It also organises Mostra Convegno Expocomfort, an exhibition in
Milan covering air conditioning and heating equipment. Editorale PEG made a
profit of L3.7bn (Pounds 1.5m) on turnover of L34.2bn (Pounds 13.7m) in
1992.
The third deal is designed to give Blenheim a base from which to replicate
some of its existing exhibitions in Japan. It is paying Dollars 1.3m (Pounds
900,000) for 70 per cent of Vertical Planning International, which organises
the Japanese Aerospace exhibition every four years. Blenheim has agreed to
acquire the remaining 30 per cent in 1999 for up to Dollars 8.7m.

FT  18 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Rentokil shares slip despite rise to Pounds
147m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Rentokil slipped by 7 1/2 p to 248 1/2 p in spite of the
environmental and property services company maintaining its 11-year record
of compound growth in profits and earnings in excess of 20 per cent.
Rentokil's pre-tax profits increased by 20.1 per cent to Pounds 147m in the
year to December 31, while sales increased by 27 per cent to Pounds 600m.
Currency movements depressed the profits figure by Pounds 1.2m.
The group said good organic growth in North America, Asia and the UK had
offset lower growth in Europe.
Securiguard, the security group bought for Pounds 76m after a hostile bid
battle last July, contributed sales of Pounds 86.3m and profit after
interest of Pounds 3.3m.
Mr Clive Thompson, chief executive, said: 'The business has proved at least
as good as we thought at the time we bought it, in some cases better.'
Mr Thompson said Rentokil's strategy, in the medium to long-term, was to
move improve Securiguard's low profit margins by providing better levels of
service.
He said: 'Our view is that security in future will require higher levels of
quality - and customers will be more concerned with quality than price,
although price is always important.'
Securiguard was making a profit margin of 5-6 per cent at the time of
acquisition, a margin which Mr Thompson said should be capable of being
lifted into the teens, although not above 20 per cent. He said the group's
US tropical plants business was making margins of 5-8 per cent at the time
of its acquisition in 1988, and was now making 20 per cent.
Rentokil set up an acquisition provision of Pounds 6.8m to cover redundancy
and reorganisation at Securiguard, of which it had utilised Pounds 1.3m by
the year-end.
Year-end net cash fell from Pounds 60.2m to Pounds 15.6m after Pounds 102.6m
had been spent on acquisitions.
Earnings per share grew by 21 per cent to 8.02p (9.71p). A final dividend of
2.01p gives a total for the year of 2.85p (2.31p), an increase of 23 per
cent.
COMMENT
Analysts were pleasantly surprised by the size of Securiguard's
contribution, but the fact that results were in line with forecasts meant
the rest of the group had performed slightly below expectations. The size of
the Securiguard provision also raised eyebrows, and there is scepticism over
how much profits can be lifted in the security business. These specific
grouses betray a deeper unease that Rentokil's wonder growth story will be
harder to sustain as a FTSE-100 company. Doubters point out that Rentokil's
36 per cent premium rating is maintained solely by the earnings story - the
yield is low and the group has net assets of only Pounds 109m, compared with
its market capitalisation of Pounds 2.4bn. The shares have had a good run
since the year-end, and could suffer further profit-taking.

FT  18 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Inspec gets Pounds 136m valuation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Inspec, the speciality chemicals company which was the subject of a Pounds
40m management buy-in/buy-out from British Petroleum 18 months ago, will
join the stock market with a valuation of Pounds 136.4m after a Pounds 49.5m
issue of shares at 160p.
The price set yesterday represents 18.4 times pro forma 1993 profits of
Pounds 7.4m, including a full year from the flotation proceeds and recent US
acquisition Allco.
Mr John Hollowood, chairman, said the rating was a 20 per cent discount to
the average of comparable speciality chemicals companies Allied Colloids,
BTP and Yorkshire Chemicals. 'Its a fair price given that Inspec has no
track record.'
The notional dividend of 3.5p for 1993 gives a yield of 2.7 per cent which
is in line with the sector.
Of the shares on offer Pounds 32.2m have been placed firm with institutions
and a further Pounds 17.3m are available to private investors through
financial intermediaries. The issue is being handled by Morgan Grenfell, the
merchant bank, and stockbrokers Cazenove.
COMMENT
Inspec combines a handsome legacy from British Petroleum - including
excellent facilities, market positions and operational management - with Mr
Hollowood's proven ability to grow speciality chemicals businesses. The
price has been set at a good discount to the sector - which has had a very
strong run - though the pro forma profits for 1993 were boosted by the
acquisition of Allco and a 20 per cent tax charge. This will rise only
gradually over the two years and analysts are looking for earnings growth of
around 15 per cent this year which cuts the rating to 16. The reception from
institutions has been very good and the shares are likely to open at a
healthy premium when trading starts on March 30.

FT  18 MAR 94 / Guinness slips as sales volumesremain flat: Spirits and beer
stagnate; Luxuries regain lustre; Reorganisation costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Guinness, the brewing and spirits group, yesterday reported a 12 per cent
decline in pre-tax profits to Pounds 702m after exceptional charges of
Pounds 173m related to a restructuring with LVMH.
The figure compares with pre-tax profits of Pounds 795m in 1992 when the
group took a Pounds 125m charge to cover reorganisations of Scotch whisky
production and the Cruzcampo brewing business in Spain.
Sales increased by 7 per cent to Pounds 4.66bn, but would have been just 1
per cent higher without beneficial currency effects.
Although the results were in line with expectations Guinness's shares fell
18p to 484p after Mr Tony Greener, chairman, cautioned: 'At this point of
the year there is no sign of generally improved market conditions.'
Nevertheless he expected a modest improvement in profits this year.
Commenting on the 1993 performance he said: 'In a year of severe economic
downturn in a number of major markets, pre-tax profits on a comparable basis
were 1 per cent lower, demonstrating once again the resilience of the
group.'
United Distillers showed a 9 per cent decline in operating profits to Pounds
701m, while the contribution from Guinness Brewing Worldwide fell 7 per cent
to Pounds 237m.
On a like-for-like basis, excluding the effects of exchange rates and other
non-comparable items, Mr Greener said spirits profits slipped 3 per cent
while beer was down 1 per cent. Spirits sales rose 7 per cent to Pounds
2.77bn, mainly due to exchange rate movements.  Volumes rose 1 per cent to
52m cases, with Scotch whisky up 3 per cent at 27m.
However, sales growth was mainly in the standard and lower priced brands and
premium sales were flat. Prices rose by an average 1 per cent, reflecting
exceptionally competitive market conditions and depressed consumer
confidence.
Brewing sales increased by 6 per cent to Pounds 1.89bn. At level exchange
rates, the rise would have been 2 per cent. Total volumes were level at
24.4m hectolitres, but excluding acquisitions they were slightly down.
Net interest charges fell by 8 per cent to Pounds 188m. Net debt fell by
Pounds 155m to Pounds 1.87bn at the end of December. Diluted earnings per
share of 22.9p were 18 per cent lower but a final dividend of 9.18p lifts
the total payment to 12.8p, an increase of 8 per cent.

FT  18 MAR 94 / Reed Elsevier advances 30% but issues caveats
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Reed Elsevier, the Anglo-Dutch information and publishing group, yesterday
celebrated its first year as a combined operation by announcing a 30 per
cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 534m (Dollars 779m) from Pounds
412m.
But the City marked down the shares of both partners, after warnings that
price increases were more difficult to achieve in low inflation conditions
and that paper and print costs were subject to upward pressures. In London,
Reed International closed down 27p at 878p and Elsevier dropped Pounds 1.33
to Pounds 62.90.
Mr Peter Davis, co-chairman, responded: 'We were not trying to signal an end
to improvement in margins. We intend to continue to improve them.'
Reed Elsevier's 1993 sales rose 14 per cent to Pounds 2.8bn, although the
improvement was only 2 per cent stripping out currency factors and
acquisitions. Operating profits rose 17 per cent to Pounds 558m.
During the year Reed Elsevier spent Pounds 403m on acquisitions, including
Pounds 277m on Official Airline Guides. Further acquisitions are likely this
year, particularly in legal publishing, although the importance of continued
organic growth was stressed by senior executives.
Mr Pierre Vinken, co-chairman, commented that if the group stopped making
acquisitions, 'you can say goodbye to double digit growth'.
Professional publishing achieved 14 per cent underlying growth, excluding
currency changes, acquisitions and pension credits. Business publishing came
second with 12 per cent, while consumer rose 9 per cent. Scientific and
medical was confined to 2 per cent, partly because of uncertainty in
pharmaceuticals markets. The company warned that although 1993 ended more
strongly than it began, there remained grounds for caution in the UK and US,
while in continental Europe indications of any recovery in trading
conditions were 'very limited'.
For Reed International shareholders, earnings per share rose 40 per cent to
37.4p - or 17 per cent to 35.8p excluding exceptionals. The full-year
dividend goes up 12 per cent to 18.75p. For Elsevier shareholders, the
earnings increase was 20 per cent to Fl 7.96 - or 16 per cent to Fl 7.63 -
and the dividend virtually doubles to Fl 5.19.

FT  18 MAR 94 / Single premiums drive up L&amp;G
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Legal &amp; General, the life and general insurer, yesterday announced a 56 per
cent rise in 1993 pre-tax profits to Pounds 181m, from Pounds 116.1m.
Profits from the core UK life and pensions business increased by 9.6 per
cent to Pounds 119.6m. The results were helped by a recovery in general UK
insurance.
The share price gained 8p to close at 510p.
The main factor in the rise in UK premium income from Pounds 1.6bn to Pounds
1.9bn was single premium business, in particular sales of unitised
with-profits bonds.
UK general insurance made a profit of Pounds 39.5m, compared with a loss of
Pounds 46.7m. Mr David Prosser, chief executive, said that L&amp;G no longer had
to make mortgage indemnity provisions, as it had done in 1992.
The group's overseas general insurance operation was sharply cut as L&amp;G
withdrew from 20 of its 21 agencies. Mr Prosser said the remaining agency
might also be terminated. 'We are not a multi-national composite.'
Mr Prosser emphasised the impact of a tougher regulatory regime on the
outlook for the UK life and pensions business, saying that the direct
additional cost of regulation in 1993 was more than Pounds 10m.
He expressed qualified support for the personal investment authority, the
new retail financial services watchdog to protect the private investor, and
said that L&amp;G would apply for membership.
New requirements for disclosure of commission and product details from the
beginning of next year would, he added, affect product design, with moves
towards greater flexibility in commission structure.
Mr Prosser said that L&amp;G had made 'prudent' provisions in its reserves
against potential compensation for people who had been given poor advice to
transfer to a personal pension from an occupational scheme.
As for general insurance, Mr Prosser said that L&amp;G would focus on its areas
of greatest expertise - a combination of personal lines, single policy cover
for small and medium sized businesses and commercial property.
A final dividend of 13.6p makes a total of 20.1p - just over 5 per cent up.
Earnings per share rose from 18.5p to 30.5p. Funds under management grew by
Pounds 9bn to Pounds 33.7bn.

FT  18 MAR 94 / UB shows transatlantic scars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
United Biscuits, the UK biscuits and snack manufacturer, showed the scars of
competition on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday with sweeping
restructuring charges totalling Pounds 121m. Its US subsidiary Keebler will
undergo radical changes in distribution and manufacture. In Europe there
will be 500 job losses, with three quarters of that in the UK.
The charges helped pull UB's pre-tax profit down to Pounds 116.7m for the
year, a fall of 28 per cent. Underlying profit was also lower at UB's
all-important UK biscuit and snacks businesses. Mr Eric Nicoli, chief
executive, said this was due less to competition than to rises in raw
material prices, partly caused by sterling's devaluation, which the group
was unable to pass on at a time of low inflation.
In the US, restructuring costs will total Pounds 92.5m, of which Pounds
11.2m had already been announced for the closure of a snack factory at
Raleigh, North Carolina. Keebler, which has only 4 per cent of the US salted
snack market, is to withdraw from 25 per cent of the US geographically. UB
said it lost money on Dollars 250m (Pounds 171m) of snack sales last year,
and had made no profit in snacks since attacking the market five years ago.
In US biscuits, UB said, most of the cost would be incurred in switching
from an advance ordering system towards van selling. Some biscuit
manufacturing lines would be closed, but no factories. Production was not
expected to fall below last year's reduced level, and UB would not withdraw
from any part of the US biscuit market.
Mr John Warren, finance director, said job losses in Europe would come
across all divisions, both in headquarters and at factories. Most of the
jobs would be in middle management, he said, with losses in the UK
proportionate to the numbers employed there.
Mr Nicoli said recovery at Keebler, which had a management upheaval last
year, was already under way. Profits in dollar terms were up 39 per cent
before exceptionals, and by 55 per cent in the second half. 'The difference
in calibre between the new management team and the old one is very marked,'
he said. 'They have a very detailed plan for the next two or three years.
The initiatives which underly the provisions are by no means the whole
story.'
Rebutting suggestions that Keebler's troubles made UB too dependent on the
UK market, Mr Nicoli said Europe and the Asia Pacific region contributed 20
per cent of last year's sales and 22 per cent of profits. 'For the fourth
year running we've reported improved sales, profits and margins in
continental Europe,' he said. 'Not many people can say that.'
Mr Warren said restructuring would involve cash outlays of Pounds 45m this
year and Pounds 20m in each of the following two years. All the European
costs would be incurred this year, while the US programme would be spread
over three. The whole programme is claimed to yield savings of more than
Pounds 50m a year by 1997.
The dividend was held unchanged at 15.3p for the year. UB's shares rose 11p
to 349p.

FT  18 MAR 94 / LVMH surges 19% and sees strong growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LVMH, the French luxury goods group, yesterday announced net profits of
FFr3.57bn (Pounds 400m) for 1993, a 19 per cent increase over the previous
year, and forecast strong earnings growth this year.
Mr Bernard Arnault, chairman, said encouraging developments had emerged
since the final quarter of 1993. He cited economic recovery in the US and
the UK, improved champagne sales, lower financial charges and a
strengthening of the Japanese cognac market. The improvement was reflected
in sales figures for the first two months which, he said, rose by 28 per
cent compared with the same period in 1993.
The group said net profits should rise by more than 20 per cent this year if
the progress experienced in the past few months continued. The share price
climbed by nearly 5 per cent to FFr4,389.
Last year's profits were boosted by exceptional gains, largely resulting
from the sale of the group's RoC cosmetics business. Without these FFr602m
gains, the company would have recorded profits of FFr2.97bn, a slight fall
on 1992 but still at the top end of expectations. Sales grew 10 per cent to
FFr23.8bn.
The performance of the cognac and champagne businesses contrasted with
luggage and perfumes. Operating profits from cognac and spirits fell from
FFr2.29bn to FFr1.91bn due to depressed demand, while champagne produced a
flat contribution of FFr780m despite a 7 per cent rise in turnover. In
luggage and leather goods, operating profits grew from FFr1.87bn to
FFr2.32bn, while perfumes and beauty products advanced from FFr809m to
FFr852m.
Earnings growth this year is expected to be supported by reduced financial
charges resulting from the reorganisation of its shareholdings with Guinness
of the UK. The January reorganisation, in which Guinness swapped its
indirect 24 per cent stake in LVMH for a direct stake in the French group's
champagne activities, brought proceeds of about FFr11bn for LVMH.
Industry observers expect LVMH to take full control of Guerlain, one of
France's most famous fragrance houses in which it has a 15 per cent stake.
A dividend of FFr15 per share, an increase of 10 per cent, is proposed.

BMW has once again proved the leading light of the German automotive
industry, according to figures released yesterday.
Riding on the strength of a DM516m (Pounds 200m) net profit last year, and
an unchanged dividend, the Munich-based performance car maker unveiled plans
to raise around DM800m through a rights issue.
Daimler-Benz, on the other hand, with more than three times the turnover of
BMW, managed a net return of only DM600m, compared with DM1.45bn last time,
according to Mr Edzard Reuter, group chairman. A reduced dividend was not
impossible, he told journalists in Berlin.
Bringing up the rear, the troubled Volkswagen group came in as expected with
a DM1.9bn loss, but maintained its DM2 payout as an indicator that the
company was on the road to recovery.
Surprise of the day was BMW's one-for-11 rights issue, approved at a meeting
of the supervisory board, which includes two representatives of the majority
stakeholding Quandt family, which will accordingly put up most of the new
capital. The proposal for a nominal DM82m capital hike to DM984m, with the
new ordinary shares priced at DM500 and preferred stock at DM365, will be
put to the annual meeting on May 19. The new shares will carry full 1994
dividend rights, the company said.
BMW's stock rose sharply in after-hours trading in Frankfurt yesterday.
Although around DM10 down on the day at DM860, it was close to its recent
record high.
Although BMW's 1993 net earnings fell almost 30 per cent from DM726m in the
previous year, the company said recently it expected an increase of 20 to 30
per cent this year, excluding any profits from the Rover group, just
purchased for Pounds 800m. Last year's profits at the German parent, BMW AG,
rose marginally to DM452m.
The company repeated yesterday that it had no need of a rights issue to
finance the Rover deal, struck at a price equivalent to the development
costs of a single new model. Observers said with long-term interest rates
tending upwards, and BMW stock so much in favour, the issue was a sensible
step.

FT  18 MAR 94 / Paris and Bonn play down row: Ambassador's criticism of
foreign policy angers Germany

France and Germany struggled yesterday to limit the damage to their
relationship after the French ambassador was summoned to the German foreign
ministry to explain highly critical remarks about Bonn's foreign policy.
The row has brought into the open growing concern in Paris about both the
style and substance of Germany's post-unification policies, in particular
over the enlargement of the European Union to the north and east.
More fuel was added to the tensions being caused by enlargement yesterday by
an attack on the process from the Greek minister for European Affairs, Mr
Theodoros Pangalos, who said he had regretted having had to lead the
negotiations allowing Sweden, Norway, Finland and Austria into the union.
Greece currently has the EU's rotating presidency.
In what appeared to be a coded attack on the heavy-handed role Germany
played in bringing the talks over entry terms to a conclusion earlier this
week, Mr Pangalos said: 'Now this is done, now that I have done my duty, I
honestly want to say that this decision was wrong.'
He warned that the prospective new entrants would make decision-making more
difficult and their entry should have been delayed until the end of the
decade. His remarks are likely to further weaken confidence in the Greek
presidency of the EU
Mr Pangalos's outburst appears to have been prompted by fears that further
pressure to open up the EU to eastern European countries would be championed
by Germany with just as much vigour as Bonn's foreign minister, Mr Klaus
Kinkel, has displayed over the past two weeks in the enlargement talks.
Greece fears the entry of more poor countries could weaken its access to EU
funds.
In Paris, a French minister admitted yesterday that Mr Kinkel had 'irritated
us with his dynamism' in Brussels.
But senior German officials said their government was both 'irritated and
annoyed' about an off-the-record interview given to German newspaper
correspondents by Mr Francois Scheer, the French ambassador in Bonn. In it,
he called for clarification by Bonn of its commitment to western Europe, and
apparently criticised German heavy-handedness in the enlargement
negotiations.
The official line of both governments, however, was to squash any suggestion
of serious dissent.
The German foreign ministry said that Mr Kinkel had held a 'detailed
telephone conversation' yesterday with Mr Alain Juppe, his French
counterpart, covering all aspects of Franco-German relations. Both ministers
had agreed that they 'attach the greatest importance to Franco-German
relations, which are characterised by deep mutual confidence', the ministry
added.
Mr Scheer also issued a statement in which he appeared to retract his
reported statements, although they have been widely confirmed by
participants in the discussion. French officials seemed considerably less
disturbed by the dissent than their German counterparts.

FT  18 MAR 94 / Drive for peace in Bosnia gains pace: Sarajevo siege eases
as Major flies in to see chief of UN operations

The first steps towards lifting the siege of Sarajevo took place yesterday
after Serbs and Moslems agreed to allow movement in and out of the Bosnian
capital on the day that Mr John Major, the prime minister, arrived in the
republic on a surprise visit.
A separate agreement between Bosnia's Croats and Moslems is due to be signed
today in Washington, highlighting the intensifying international moves
towards an overall settlement for former Yugoslavia.
Mr Major flew in last night and is due to meet General Sir Michael Rose, the
British head of the UN operation in Bosnia, today. British officials said
the purpose the prime minister's visit was to see the conditions in which
British troops were operating and to discuss a joint initiative with the US
to rebuild the infrastructure of Sarajevo.
The Sarajevo agreement, signed yesterday by Mr Momcilo Krajisnik, speaker of
the Bosnian Serb assembly, and Mr Hasan Muratovic, a Bosnian official
responsible for UN affairs, comes into effect on Wednesday.
Although the deal falls short of allowing complete freedom of movement, it
signals the gradual return of normality to a city besieged by Serb forces
for over 23 months, and whose inhabitants were prevented by the Bosnian
government from leaving for fear the capital's defences would collapse.
However, commercial traffic will not be allowed into the city, people can be
refused permission to leave and anyone wanting to cross the front lines on
certain routes must apply for permission 24 hours in advance.
'The siege will not be over until all citizens can be transported freely,'
Mr Muratovic told reporters in Sarajevo.
The agreement is a result of the shuttle diplomacy led by Mr Vitaly Churkin,
Russia's special envoy, Mr Charles Redman, his US counterpart, and UN
officials in their bid to maintain the peace momentum after Bosnian Serbs
last month agreed to withdraw all heavy weapons from Sarajevo or risk Nato
air strikes.
This shuttle diplomacy has also produced the agreement expected to be sealed
today in Washington when President Bill Clinton presides over the signing of
a constitution which will bind Bosnian Croats and Moslems in a loose
federation.
President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia and President Alija Izetbegovic of
Bosnia, are to sign the agreement, which is likely to pave the way for the
establishment of a confederation between Croatia and the new Bosnian
federation in a move which could end the fighting in the western part of
Bosnia.
Mr Churkin, who is in Washington, is due to hold talks with US and UN
officials at which he is expected to spell out plans for an agreement
between Serbia and Croatia as part of an overall settlement aimed at finally
bringing peace to the region.

FT  18 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Guinness
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Having worked hard to reduce its costs and stepped up marketing spending on
its brands, all Guinness now needs is a drop of recovery in the drinks
market. The 4 per cent slide in its shares following yesterday's results
partly reflects the downbeat trading statement that accompanied them. True,
there are some glimmerings in spirits, up 1 per cent by volume last year
with Scotch whisky sales up 3 per cent. But demand is strongest in
lower-priced brands and price rises lagged inflation. Even these modest
volume increases are being bought at the expense of margins.
In brewing, efforts to exploit the stout brand are overshadowed by the
continued slide in Cruzcampo's profits. Recession and the lack of Olympic
games custom provide convenient excuses for its poor performance, but
Guinness now has ample cause to regret buying into Spanish brewing
expensively and at the wrong time.
Still, there may be little alternative, as in spirits, but to wait for
better times. At least the cash inflow from the recent LVMH deal will reduce
gearing to 38 per cent. Since Guinness is generating ample cash from
operations, the LVMH deal hastens the day when it must find a way of
spending some of this money. Presumably another Cruzcampo is not on the
cards, though smaller targetted acquisitions may be. Or perhaps Guinness
could again buy in its own shares, starting with the 4 per cent stake that
LVMH must sell by June next year.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr David Prosser deserves full credit for turning Legal &amp; General around
since taking over as chief executive in the autumn of 1991. Recent new
business figures have been up with the pack after three dismal years. Costs
have been reduced and L&amp;G's mixed record on compliance - witness the recent
record fine imposed by Lautro - is being addressed. True, the profits
recovery evident in yesterday's full year figures owes more to the cyclical
upswing in general insurance rates. By reserving fully against mortgage
indemnity losses and buying extensive reinsurance cover, though, L&amp;G has
limited its downside risk. If that allows its management to concentrate on
the long-term savings business, so much the better.
There is certainly no shortage of challenges. How L&amp;G will cope with the
tough new regulatory regime promised by the Securities and Investments Board
is difficult to judge. Since endowment mortgages account for a relatively
large slice of sales, full disclosure of commissions is a real threat. That
said, L&amp;G may be big enough and have a strong enough brand to diversify into
alternative savings products such as unit trusts. The company's respectable
investment performance in recent years is another reason for optimism.
Yet it remains a racing certainty that tougher regulation will result in
fewer life assurance contracts being sold across the industry. Until L&amp;G
proves itself a winner, its shares are likely to suffer with the rest of the
sector whatever the attractions in terms of yield.

FT  18 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Reed Elsevier
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
For the market to shave 3 per cent from Reed's share price on the day when
the company demonstrated that the merger with Elsevier was working is a
predictable meanness. The shares have all but doubled since the merger was
announced, and a 40 per cent premium rating to the market is difficult to
sustain without comparable earnings prospects. Those overly besotted with
multimedia hype have also received a refreshing bucket of cold water as the
sector's shorter term earnings prospects have become clearer.
Yet to dwell on the negative influences is to miss the point about Reed
Elsevier. The company has an enviable mix of high margin steady growth
businesses and lower margin consumer titles which are about to benefit from
the upswing. Even with that spread, the portfolio is sensibly concentrated
in specific publishing areas. The management's clear strategic view is a
force to be reckoned with. Strong cash flow and high interest cover mean the
group has plenty of fire power ready to use as and when attractive
acquisition opportunities emerge. The purchase of Official Airline Guides
for Dollars 415m and its subsequent rationalisation reassures that the
company may resist overpaying.
In the absence of a hot-headed aggressive bid, large-scale acquisitions may
take longer than the market would ideally like. But then, shareholders have
long kept faith with Reed, despite its humdrum earnings record. It is worth
hanging on a little longer, since all that remains is for the management
fully to exploit the opportunity it has created for itself.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
United Biscuits stands on the fault line in the UK food manufacturing
industry and is desperately struggling to ensure the ground does not give
way beneath its feet. Strong brands and international expansion have enabled
Unilever and Cadbury Schweppes to move to firmer terrain. UB may yet be able
to join them. Its ambitious Pounds 121m restructuring programme will now
determine its fate.
The 2 percentage point drop in McVitie's fat margins highlights the
pressures in UB's home patch where raw material price rises are still
hurting. UB may be able to staunch that decline if its promised costs
savings are recycled into increased marketing spend. Promising growth in
mainland Europe and the far east is also contributing to the cause. But UB's
fortunes hinge on the US where most of the restructuring costs will fall
over the next three years. Keebler is taking to the hills in salty snacks,
trying to become a strong regional operator rather than a weak national one.
The marketing and distribution changes in its cookies business also seem a
textbook strategy; the only trouble is Keebler's competitors may have read
the same book.
Still, by ransacking the 1993 balance sheet, UB at least stands a chance of
delivering some earnings and dividend growth over the next few years. The
market may well appreciate those short-term attractions, especially given
the underpinning of a 6 per cent yield. But the broader risk remains that in
its world of scarce cash resources, UB will only feed its problems and
starve its strengths.

FT  18 MAR 94 / Odd couple's testing tiffs: David Buchan and Quentin Peel
examine emerging strains in a relationship that has underpinned European
unity for decades
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN and QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Paris and Bonn are getting on each other's nerves - badly. With an election
season in full swing in Germany and getting under way in France, fits of
mutual pique could develop into a more serious rift with consequences for
other members of a European Union that is shortly to come under successive
German and French presidencies.
The German foreign ministry yesterday called in Mr Francois Scheer, France's
ambassador in Bonn, to complain about his comments to German journalists
that Germany had taken a heavy-handed - and in Paris's view, unhelpful -
line in the negotiations to admit Nordic countries and Austria to the EU.
But Mr Scheer was just echoing his masters' voice. A French minister said
yesterday Mr Klaus Kinkel, Germany's foreign minister, had 'irritated us
with his dynamism' in enlargement talks. In a counter-productive bid to push
enlargement along, Mr Kinkel had misled new members into thinking they could
get away with partial acceptance of EU rules, and had thus 'delayed'
conclusion of enlargement talks, the minister complained.
This row, full of portent for the future, awkwardly coincides with two
emotion-charged historical brouhahas. One concerns Germany's possible
presence at the 50th anniversary of the D-Day landings in Normandy this
June. Chancellor Helmut Kohl would love to be invited, if only to show his
electorate how solidly he has reconciled Germany with its former enemies.
But fearful of a backlash from army veterans, older Gaullists and even some
wartime allies, the French government is hanging back. It has even shelved
its earlier idea of holding some kind of Franco-German commemoration on May
8, the 49th anniversary of the end of the second world war, because Mr Kohl
does not want to be fobbed off with second best. For his part, Mr Kohl has
turned down the request of France as well as the US and the UK to mark the
final departure of their troops from Berlin this summer with a military
march-past. Instead, he is planning a German torchlit parade, with perhaps
questionable historical connotations.
There are other pinpricks to the relationship. They include:
France, awaiting further guarantees that the European Parliament will remain
in Strasbourg, is blocking legislation that would, inter alia, give Germany
18 more Euro-seats for its eastern Lander. A German diplomat went to Paris
recently to warn that German political parties would take it 'seriously
amiss' if they did not get extra Euro-seats in time for June's European
Parliament election.
France's largest promised investment in eastern Germany is threatening to
turn sour, with Elf-Aquitaine, the newly privatised oil company, trying to
evade part of its commitment to sink DM3bn (Pounds 1.1bn) into a showcase
refinery at Leuna. Worried about rising unemployment and his falling
popularity in that region, Mr Kohl has complained to the French government.
France's industry minister, Mr Gerard Longuet, recently complained that
'Germany has to accept there are other industrial countries in Europe',
expressing frustration at the lack of Franco-German co-operation in cars,
high-speed trains and energy.
Many such tensions would pass unnoticed between other countries. But
expectations of the Franco-German relationship are very high, precisely
because of what the two countries have achieved since they signed their
Elysee friendship treaty 31 years ago. Indeed, the traditional way of giving
the relationship a shot in the arm is for the leaders of both countries to
announce some grand new initiative. But of new ideas, there seem to be few.
One exception is a French plan for a joint armaments agency with Germany.
But its adoption at this summer's bilateral summit is uncertain, because Mr
Kohl is preoccupied with an electorate unappreciative of military spending.
The Maastricht treaty, of course, gives Paris and Bonn a long-term agenda,
and the two countries have weathered a series of strains in the past year -
over currencies, Bosnia and the Gatt negotiations. But their latest spat
over enlargement bodes ill for the future, precisely because there will be
future admissions to the EU from central Europe. Paris is not questioning
whether Union membership should be increased - it accepts its inevitability
 -but it is raising the question of how this should take place.
The rock on which the Franco-German partnership has recently rested is the
solid understanding built up by Mr Kohl and President Francois Mitterrand in
their 80-odd meetings over the past decade. But, in this curiously top-down
alliance, what happens when the top changes? Would it be the same if a
President Jacques Chirac came to power in France next year, representing a
more hard-nosed Gaullism, or if Mr Rudolf Scharping's Social Democrats were
to win a share of power at this October's federal German election, bringing
in an anti-militarism that could thwart France's ambitions for common
European defence?
For all the ministerial encounters in Franco-German summits every six months
for the past 31 years, the political classes of the two countries are not
close. Their institutions and parties differ too much. On the left, French
and German socialists have long maintained contact, but on the right there
is no unified conservative party in France to talk to Mr Kohl's Christian
Democrats.
However, the history of the relationship is one of trying to create links at
all levels. For instance, the prospect of monetary union is pushing the
National Assembly and the Bundestag closer. It was striking early this year
that Mr Jean-Claude Trichet presented his first public testimony - as
governor of the newly independent Bank of France - to the Bundestag in Bonn
a few days before he did so to the National Assembly in Paris, and even more
striking that this passed without comment in France.
Greasing the often creaky wheels of the Franco-German locomotive is a
network of French and German bureaucrats who have spent some time in each
other's countries, civil service colleges and administrations. The French
and German foreign ministries each take in two diplomats from the other
country for one or two years. This exchange has operated for some seven
years.
Since 1947 France's Ecole Nationale d'Administration (ENA), which has no
direct equivalent in Germany, has taken nearly 300 Germans into its
prestigious courses. Many of them, fluent in French and often with French
wives, are now high in the German administration, such as Mr Joachim
Bitterlich, Mr Kohl's foreign policy adviser. They have long-standing
personal contacts with their fellow enarques in all reaches of French
political and business life. A far smaller number of French has passed
through the Bundesakademie, the German civil service college.
Similarly, military links are being forged with the creation in 1989 of the
Franco-German brigade and the establishment this year of the Strasbourg
headquarters of the Eurocorps despite cultural differences. The reformed
postwar German military tradition of the 'citizen in uniform' is at odds
with the unreconstructed authoritarianism of the French military. Germans in
the brigade find French officers downright rude at times, while French find
German officers long-winded in their politeness.
But by far the biggest point of contact between the two countries is, of
course, business. They are each other's biggest trading partner. In 1992
France took 13 per cent of Germany's exports, and Germany 17 per cent of
French exports. For a long time, the relationship was largely one of trading
goods across the Rhine, though the German chemical companies started to
invest directly in France in the 1970s, partly to satisfy French farmers'
appetite for fertiliser, while French investment in Germany only caught up a
bit with the fall of the Berlin Wall.
But French investment in Germany still only totals DM12.7bn, putting France
in sixth place (behind the UK), while Germany has invested DM22.7bn in
France, making it the second-largest investor behind the US. Because of the
labour-heavy investments in eastern Germany, slightly more Germans (250,000)
now work for French subsidiaries than French (220,000) do for German
subsidiaries.
This half-million labours under sharply contrasting management cultures and
styles, though management goals of investing for the long term are
increasingly similar. 'It would be hard to find two more different cultures
 -France is very centralised and everything happens in Paris in a very urban
environment. In Germany it is just the opposite, and the French find it hard
to adapt to the very different environments of Hamburg, Munich, Berlin,'
says Mr Roland Berger, a German management consultant.
Mr Berger finds the French 'equally puzzled by the decentralised German
corporate structure. German corporate law puts the responsibility on the
company board, and German companies tend to be managed by a team of
different specialities on those boards.'
Mr Rene Laserre, of the Paris Institute for the Study of Contemporary
Germany, echoes this. 'With us it is a monarchy, a presidential system,
while German companies have a parliamentary system.'
He also points to the difference between French and German labour relations.
'It is two different worlds,' says Mr Laserre. 'In Germany, mitbestimmung
(co-determination) for the workers in management decisions really means
that, while in France the role of the comite d'entreprise (worker's council)
is purely consultative.' As a result, it is almost impossible to exchange
shopfloor managers back and forth across the Rhine.
Because of these differences, 'it is essential companies allow their
subsidiaries a lot of freedom', says Mr Berger. In addition to the
publishing group Bertelsmann, with its thriving magazines in France,
examples of successful cross-Rhine management include St Gobain's
relationship with Vegla, its large German subsidiary, Hoechst's relationship
with Roussel-Uclaf, the French pharmaceutical company it controls, and
Alcatel's relationship with SEL, its telecommunications subsidiary in
Germany.
But some managements, particularly on the French side, are too pushy, Mr
Laserre claims. The bid by Credit Lyonnais to link up with Commerzbank was
doomed to failure because the state-owned French bank wanted to rival
Commerzbank in its home market, he says, while newly privatised Banque
Nationale de Paris's (BNP) co-operation with Dresdner Bank is working
precisely because it is limited to third countries. He claims Thomson, the
French electronics group, demoralised the staff of its Telefunken
acquisition by managing it from Paris.
Both these setbacks concern French state-owned companies, of which German
businessmen are highly suspicious. A survey by Heidrick and Struggles, the
management consultant, of the top 200 companies in France and Germany showed
45 per cent of the top French managers had worked for the state, and only 8
per cent on the German side. This is why France's current privatisation
programme - despite its side-effect in freeing Elf to reconsider its
commercial view of the Leuna project - has a wider importance in enabling
French managers to adopt the same private-sector attitudes as their German
counterparts.
A common culture in the broader sense is what the new Arte television
station aims to foster. Set up by President Mitterrand and Mr Kohl after
German reunification, it broadcasts in French or German (with subtitles in
the other language). It has about 2 per cent of the audience in France and a
bit less in Germany. Not much, but this corresponds, according to Mr
Olivier-Rene Veillon of Arte, to the number of French and Germans who speak
each other's language.
It is very revealing of differing Franco-German habits and tastes. 'We find
that French and Germans don't laugh at the same thing,' says Mr Veillon.
'Only Anglo-Saxon productions like Monty Python or Fawlty Towers make
Germans and French laugh equally.'
Arte makes a brave effort to get the two countries to face their sorry past.
When it aired a documentary called War of the Screens, examining French and
German government wartime propaganda use of television, Arte's audience rose
to 4 per cent. Every Sunday, too, Arte runs film from both sides of the same
events in the second world war. 'It is very important for countries which
are so dependent on each other to know each other better,' says Mr Veillon.
France and Germany face a tricky transition. Their last war is not distant
enough to avoid painful anniversaries, yet too distant for new generations
of leaders on both sides of the Rhine necessarily to feel the same
commitment to unity. It is clearly too early to pronounce the Franco-German
relationship has so deepened that it can survive unscathed any changes at
the helm.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michel Camdessus, managing director of the International Monetary Fund,
has been put in an impossible position by the group of seven leading
industrial countries. He is in Moscow to decide whether to release the
second Dollars 1.5bn tranche of funds aimed at assisting reform. If he does
not release them, the IMF will be blamed for the deterioration in the
economy. If he does, the economy will deteriorate, nonetheless. His is a
doomed mission.
So what should the west be doing, instead?
First, it must remember that Russia is both a nuclear power and Europe's
most threatening neighbour. Its problems cannot be approached as if the
country were the Philippines, or even Brazil.
Second, it must understand the roots of the disaster, which are the collapse
of the communist economy and the attendant moral and fiscal bankruptcy of
the state. The claims inherited from the Soviet Union greatly exceed the
resources upon which the government can lay its desperate hands. The budget
deficit is supposed to be 10 per cent of gross domestic product. In fact, it
is at least 15 per cent, before meeting the defence minister's demand for a
doubling of the military budget.
Third, the west needs to provide enough resources to allow Russia to rebuild
both its economy and its bankrupt government, delivered in ways that
actually allow it to do so. This means currency stabilisation and funds
sufficient to close the budget deficit, conditional upon the establishment
of private property, price reform, industrial restructuring and tight
control over subsidies. The funds required will be large, but their duration
need not be that great. With credibility restored, money could pour into the
country, some of it as returning flight capital. But the IMF's Dollars 1.5bn
 -roughly half a per cent of Russia's GDP - is neither here nor there.
Fourth, the principals should themselves be present in Moscow. The IMF is
not even the ideal agent, partly because it is obliged to treat Russia as
just another member country, partly because it does not possess the
necessary political authority and partly because it does not have the needed
resources. If the G7 is to act, it should send someone of the stature of Mr
Larry Summers, US treasury undersecretary for international affairs, to talk
to those who matter, decide whether reform is feasible and then cajole the
G7 into offering the assistance that might make it work.
Finally, the west must decide whether now is the time. The government of Mr
Victor Chernomyrdin has made a greater effort to hold the budgetary line
than many expected. Mr Victor Gerashchenko, the central bank chairman, has
even started to behave like a monetarist. But the perseverance of the
government is highly uncertain and the support of the parliament still more
so, particularly when President Yeltsin has withdrawn from the scene.
For all that, it is both right to explore the possibilities of today and
essential to prepare for the fresh opportunities for radical reform that
may, given Russia's economic plight, emerge tomorrow. What makes no sense at
all is to prefer the certainty of failure to the chance of success. At
present, the G7 has no policy for Russia. It is just making gestures.

FT  18 MAR 94 / Leading Article: Malaysian moves
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the Malaysian prime minister, has made it clear that he
is in no mood to rescind his government's embargo on purchasing British
goods. 'No contracts in exchange for British press freedom to tell lies,' he
wrote in a letter published in yesterday's FT.
Dr Mahathir's reaction to newspaper reports that bribes were allegedly
offered to Malaysian politicians is unwarranted. The British government has
no control over what the country's press says, nor should it. By linking
government contracts to whether British newspapers say nice things about his
regime, Dr Mahathir has damaged trading relations that are important to both
countries. If he has been libelled, the right response would be to sue in
the British courts.
Eventually Dr Mahathir may realise that the trade ban will damage Malaysia
as much as, if not more than, Britain. He has not only reduced his choice of
suppliers but alerted the world to the risks of doing business with
Malaysia. He should remember that reputations take longer to build than to
destroy.
In the meantime, the question is how the British government should respond.
There should certainly be no apologies, since Malaysia has wronged Britain,
not vice versa. Unfortunately, there has been a tendency to appeasement by
some ministers: Mr Richard Needham, the trade minister, has even blamed the
press for the dispute.
Though apologies should be ruled out, Britain has little interest, at this
stage, in escalating matters. An argument could be made for a symmetrical
ban on UK government contracts to Malaysian business. But retaliation should
only be considered if strong protests fail to change Dr Mahathir's mind. The
UK's European partners should be asked to join such protests, for wider
issues of press freedom and commercial policy are at stake.
The dispute underlines the need for international rules to prevent
governments using discriminatory public procurement in this way. Although a
Gatt code covering public procurement exists, it has been signed by only a
handful of countries, of which Malaysia is not one. It would be naive to
think that Dr Mahathir could be persuaded to sign the code in current
circumstances. But extending it to all Gatt members should be one of the
European Union's medium-term goals.

FT  18 MAR 94 / Leading Article: Africa's gloom
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sub-Saharan Africa's economic decline may have been arrested, and in some
countries modestly reversed. But the long-awaited World Bank report on
structural adjustment in the region is deeply worrying, nevertheless.
Current growth rates among the best performers are 'still too low to reduce
poverty much in the next two or three decades'. With today's poor policies,
it will be 40 years before the region returns to its income per head of the
mid-1970s, says the report.
The sheer misery of countries not covered in the report can only be guessed
at: Sudan, Africa's largest state, Zaire, potentially one of its wealthiest,
Angola, Somalia and Liberia. Meanwhile, Burundi, which was doing rather
well, has had a coup and Nigeria has slid backwards, after having been a
leading performer between 1987 and 1991. Last weekend it was given a
justified ticking off by Mr Kim Jaycox, the bank's vice-president for
Africa.
The fundamental questions are why Africa has been left trailing by the rest
of the developing world and what can be done to remedy the calamity. Some of
the answers may emerge in Tokyo this week, where the Japanese finance
ministry has brought together World Bank and IMF officials, other donors and
African governments, to discuss lessons from east Asia's success.
Mr Lee Kuan Yew of economically successful Singapore made a start last
November, when he offered Africa his own sensible checklist: clean
government; an effective and adequately paid civil service; family planning;
'pragmatism, not dogma, in economics'; letting foreigners and local
entrepreneurs 'get on with their business'; universal education; and going
'for results not political correctness'. Mr Lee had another piece of advice,
one that goes to the heart of Africa's development disaster: maintain
national solidarity and social cohesion.
Africa faces many formidable obstacles in its efforts to recover. The
infrastructure is desperately poor, privatisation painfully slow, the
external debt burden heavy, management weak and education inadequate. In all
of these areas outsiders can offer some assistance. But the continent's most
formidable hurdles, those of social fragmentation and brutal political
exploitation, are not susceptible to outside intervention. Too often
governments fail to act on behalf of their countries. Obligations extend,
instead, in concentric circles, beginning with family, village and clan, and
embracing tribe, but not country.
It is not Africa's fault that boundaries are arbitrary, that former nation
states were divided, or several nations encompassed within newly created
territories. The Organisation of African Unity's decision to retain those
colonial boundaries was right. But after independence, African leaders
failed to build either the machinery or, more important, the attitudes
required by functioning modern states. Building such a social compact may
require a new generation of leaders.
Make no mistake, structural adjustment is necessary, even though it is bound
to work slowly. But it may not work at all if those with power do not feel
obliged to serve the interests of the people.

Fed up with paying too much for your car insurance? In that case buy
yourself a pastel-coloured motor. Barry Hulbert, who runs Hill House
Hammond, one of the UK's biggest chains of high street insurance shops, says
owners of black or red vehicles may have to pay higher premiums because,
statistically, they are more likely to make a claim.
Is the implication that if all drivers of red and black cars change to
lemon, they are suddenly going to have fewer accidents? Oh well, the
insurance industry always prefers putting carts before horses.

For some odd reason the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society, one of the

Pounds 400,000 to sponsor Classic FM's answer to BBC Radio 4's Gardeners'

Having pruned back its range of financial products, C&amp;G is now diversifying
into sweatshirts, watering cans and gardening gloves. The thinking seems to
be that since many C&amp;G customers like gardening, they will come to love the

Maybe so, but the weeding out of the society's unprofitable members arouses
a suspicion; is C&amp;G uprooting itself from the building society movement and

The London and Shanghai stock exchanges are going to be doing a lot more
co-operating, following this week's visit to China by London stock exchange
chairman Sir Andrew Hugh Smith. But Observer hears that Sir Andrew's trip
was not without its hiccups.
To do business in China a foreign businessman needs a Chinese host. Not
normally a problem, especially when the visitor has a knighthood. Hence some
puzzlement in British diplomatic circles when no one seemed willing to take
care of Sir Andrew, in town for a British Invisibles seminar.
Sir Andrew's cv seems to have been the problem. Not only is he a member of
British Invisibles but he is also a vice chairman of Britain's Guide Dogs
for the Blind council.
Putting two and two together, the Chinese seemingly wondered whether
invisibility was something to do with blindness - which perhaps explains the
delay in finding a companion for Sir Andrew.
Fortunately the misunderstanding was spotted in time.

Browne reckons the tie is bound to make an impression at any City gathering.
Now he's thinking of expanding the market by selling franchises to judges in

FT  18 MAR 94 / A mirage on the left
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The fact has to be faced: Mr John Smith may be our next prime minister. He
could step into No 10 Downing Street in, say, April 1996. That is just two
tax increases away. Peer into the crystal. The Scottish ascendancy triumphs,
give or take an English name or two. Chancellor - Gordon Brown. Home
secretary - Tony Blair. Foreign secretary - Jack Cunningham. Jack who? Never
mind, it could be someone else.
This startling vision, this electrifying anticipation, is in the political
air. It could be a mirage. Yet no matter how much you shake your head, the
notion that the Conservatives are approaching the end of their run will not
be dispelled. The opinion polls, which so misled us in April 1992, have put
Labour at 20 to 25 points ahead and kept it there. Their failure two years
ago may not wholly invalidate their methods. Mr Smith's party is scoring
well in traditional areas of Tory strength, such as management of the
economy, taxation, and law and order. More to the point, we know without
benefit of poll results that the Conservatives are no longer trusted.
'Nobody believes a word we say,' one of their senior advisers complained the
other day. We do have a lamentable lack of faith, we who have been gulled,
gulled and gulled again.
Most voters now appear to believe that Mr John Major's government will be
thrown out next time. Yet where they place their crosses is more telling
than what they tell interviewers. It is a fair assumption that the
Conservatives will lose ground in the forthcoming by-elections, not to
mention the local elections in May and the European elections in June. If
they do it will be difficult to resist the conclusion that Mr Major is
unlikely to remain in office until the end of the century, as I once
imagined he might.
The possibility that Labour will come back has been noted in Washington.
When he visited the American capital last week Mr Brown and entourage were
received by luminaries of the administration's economic team. A Labour party
adviser was welcomed into the White House and shown around by the young
heroes of Little Rock. It may be too much to suggest the president's
political strategists will collude with Mr Smith's associates, in
retaliation for the support given by the Conservatives to President Bush.
Yet there is a political rapport be-tween important individuals in the two
parties that may pay divi-dends - unless President Bill Clinton is brought
into irretrievable disrepute by the Whitewater affair.
The US Democrats are looking with interest at Mr Smith and, perhaps more
particularly, at Mr Rudolf Scharping, the German Social Democratic party
leader. If Mr Scharping joins, or heads, the German government after the
election in October, Mr Smith should gain from the ensuing sense of
momentum, the feeling that the reformed left in northern Europe is on its
way.
It would be imprudent to allow this increasingly common fancy to determine
Labour's political strategy. The bubble could so easily burst. There is no
law that requires an election before April 1997. Opinion poll leads can melt
away in an afternoon. Anything can happen in a period as long as 37 months.
Mr Smith's slow-motion repositioning of his party is the most dangerous
strategy he could have chosen. It leaves him vulnerable to a long, shallow,
recovery of Conservative fortunes, capped by a surprise cut in taxation, a
snap election during a period of optimism about the economy, and a campaign
during which Labour's package of proposals, presented very late in the day,
is easily dismissed.
The Labour leader clearly sees matters differently. Solid repositioning work
is being done. Mr Tony Blair would make an excellent Conservative home
secretary. His law and order speeches are more convincing than those of Mr
Michael Howard, the present incumbent. They include an appeal to both reason
and emotion. Mr John Prescott has been allowed to persuade the party that
private investors should be persuaded to enter joint agreements with public
authorities to finance specified projects. Mr Donald Dewar has distanced
Labour from its previous, impossibly costly, pledges to increase state
pensions in line with prices. His recent speech on this subject was
thoughtful and pragmatic. He even managed to propose a way of introducing
targeted benefits while affecting that there would be no means test
involved. The trick is to top up pensions from three sources - state,
private and occupational - to create a minimum retirement income at minimum
cost.
Each of these is an instance of the steady build-up of reassurance that
Labour needs. The proposition that the people's party may not be so bad
after all has to be sold to a large number of separate constituencies, one
by one. Mr Smith has put some markers down indicating what Labour would
actually do, most notably in the field of constitutional reform. He would
contemplate proportional representation only if Mr Paddy Ashdown's Liberal
Democrats held a pistol to his head, but he is committed to a Scottish
assembly. A bill of rights and a freedom of information bill could be
introduced quickly and at no financial cost. A first step might be taken
towards reform of the House of Lords, probably by excluding hereditary peers
from the vote. A surprising number of appointed Tory lordships would support
such a move today if Mr Major had the wit to propose it.
Mr Smith's supporters argue that, apart from maintaining the attack on the
government, little more need be done than carry on with incremental changes
in stance like those listed above. From Labour's point of view, they say,
there is no alternative to lying low while the Tories continue to destroy
themselves. Any other strategy comes up against questions that are
impossible to answer - when will the election come? who will be prime
minister at the time? will the Conservatives be united? what will they have
on offer?
It is not good enough. The imperfections of the government combined with the
uninspiring nature of the principal opposition party have contributed to a
national mood of political despondency. All politicians seem equally
reprehensible. Nothing on offer makes the heart beat faster. A new Labour
paper promising to control public spending is entitled 'trust and hope'.
British voters have lost trust. They seek in vain for a source of hope.

FT  18 MAR 94 / Greenhouse faces stoning: Is global warming really such a
threat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the past five years global warming has been high on the world's list of
environmental worries. Outstripping other 'green' concerns in the scale of
its potential impact and in the complexity of its causes, it has offered the
environmental movement some of its grandest images of apocalypse.
Industrialised countries took the threat so seriously that they made curbing
emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases the target of a treaty
negotiated at the Rio Earth Summit in 1992. On Monday, that treaty becomes
international law, following ratification by more than 50 countries;
signatories will now have to draw up plans for curbing emissions. This week
in Geneva, the United Nations has wrestled with proposals for a fund to help
developing countries cut emissions too.
However, this legislative and bureaucratic effort is misguided, according to
Global Warming: Apocalypse or Hot Air?, published this week by the Institute
of Economic Affairs. The authors, Roger Bate and Julian Morris, are
economists at the institute, a free-market think-tank. The introduction by
Wilfred Beckerman, an Oxford economist fond of tilting at environmental
exaggerations, urges resistance to the 'cohorts of eco-doomsters who warn us
we are living on the edge of the abyss'.
Bate and Morris acknowledge that the science which underpins predictions of
global warming is not in dispute. Physicists agree that some gases,
including carbon dioxide, now referred to as 'greenhouse gases', can trap
heat which is emitted from the earth's surface and so prevent it passing
into space.
The authors take issue, however, with the hypothesis that, if greenhouse
gases build up in the atmosphere, the planet will warm up. The four leading
models of climate change used worldwide suggest that, if carbon dioxide
levels double, the world will warm up by between 1.9`C and 5.2`C from
existing levels.
Among other criticisms, Bate and Morris say such climate models cannot fully
explain the warming of about 0.5`C that appears to have taken place this
century. Instead, warming may be occurring because monitoring stations are
located near cities, which have been getting larger and warmer, they
suggest.
These complaints are rejected by scientists studying models of climate
change, such as Bruce Callander, head of the working party which weighs up
scientific research for the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change. In his view: 'It is naive to bring up urbanisation as a
problem, because it is recognised and has been thoroughly addressed.'
Callander acknowledges that the models have many shortcomings. The behaviour
of clouds remains the 'single biggest uncertainty', he says; modellers are
not sure whether clouds speed up warming or slow it down. But he adds: 'The
modellers themselves are the models' greatest critics.'
Scientists admit that the global warming hypothesis is unproven, and that
they will need years of further data to know whether predictions are
accurate. The authors exaggerate the degree of scientific certainty and do
not succeed in establishing that the threat of warming should be dismissed.
They are on stronger ground in looking at ways in which economists have
tried to compensate for the imperfect state of scientific knowledge in
formulating policy.
The pamphlet deftly picks holes in the green lobby's favourite claim that
measures to improve energy efficiency are a 'no-regrets' policy, providing
benefits such as cheaper fuel bills as well as curbing emissions. The
authors maintain that, if savings from investing in energy efficiency
outstripped the costs, companies and households would have made those
changes already.
They home in, too, on the spurious precision of 'cost-benefit analysis'  -
the technique of comparing the costs and benefits of a particular policy
before deciding whether to proceed. The estimates are necessarily tentative,
yet are often used as firm predictions; the UK government's recent proposals
to tax rubbish dumping are a case in point.
But as in their attack on science, the authors are shadow-boxing at targets
which are less solid than they claim. For instance, the policies which the
authors warn would slow economic growth have not been implemented. The Rio
convention, in the watered-down form which finally received international
consent, tells countries only to draw up plans for curbing emissions, not to
make cuts. And although the authors rail against the European Union's
proposals for an energy tax, they seem not to have noticed that the
proposals are stalled, if not dead.
In addition, the pamphlet's only recommendation - dashed off in two
paragraphs - is that all taxes and subsidies on fossil fuels should be
removed worldwide. 'This is likely both to reduce emissions and increase
global economic output,' Bate and Morris state baldly.
The shortcomings of their case are unfortunate, because scepticism about
environmental scaremongering is welcome and all too rare. So is the reminder
that, in pandering to green populism, governments can put in place policies
which are counter-productive and expensive.
The Rio convention will encourage governments to grapple with the important
question of whether any international agreement to curb carbon dioxide
emissions can be binding. Such treaties are almost impossible to police, as
the emissions of individual countries are hard to monitor. Further,
countries may be tempted to avoid the inconvenience and cost of the curbs,
provided they can be satisfied that they will benefit from other countries
continuing to observe them.
The only contribution which could settle the global warming debate, however,
is more data about climate change. In Callander's words, 'in 10 years we may
say (scientists' investigation) has been an interesting exercise which came
to nothing, or we may say that we were recognising something important
happening in the atmosphere. At the moment, though, (the threat) should be
taken seriously.'

FT  18 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Parliament in need of wide-ranging
reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GRAHAM ALLEN MP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British
Industry, is the latest person to call for a serious review of how
parliament works ('CBI chief calls for overhaul of law-making', March 15).
There can surely be few people inside the Palace of Westminster who believe
the theatre and yah-boo of the house is a substitute for serious
professional scrutiny of the executive. Whether and when ministers lie to
the Commons is a matter for debate. What is plain, however, is they now
evade many reasonable requests for information as a matter of routine.
Standing committees on bills often replicate the worst features of the
chamber, and departmental select committees - a breakthrough 14 years ago -
need to move up a gear to the level of the public accounts committee.
Rather than extending the pre-legislative stitch-up to include business, as
Mr Howard suggests, how much better to have open discussion on bills with
standing committees taking evidence before getting locked into committee
stage. There are many other areas that require reform, from the ludicrous
late-night sittings to time-tabling of bills and scrutiny of European
legislation. The implications for improving value for money, reducing public
expenditure errors and re-invigorating economic policy-making cannot be
underestimated.
As part of what opposition leader John Smith has called 'a new constitution
for a new century', Labour's commission on democracy this year will be
looking at the possibilities for creating a modern self-respecting and
democratic chamber, able to aspire to Gladstone's dictum of 'not running the
country but holding to account those that do'. All of us - business included
 -will be the better for that.

FT  18 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Ukraine already enjoying significant
benefits from new focus of EBRD
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr VICTOR A YUSHENKO and Mr ALEXANDER N SHAROV
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, David Marsh's article, 'Excess gives way to restraint' (March 4) echoes
the reaction of many officials and professionals in countries which have
received European Bank for Reconstruction and Development investment to the
changes effected by Mr Jacques de Larosiere since his appointment as
president of EBRD.
Former EBRD president Mr Jacques Attali's reputation as a visionary is well
recognised. However, we felt that, under his leadership, EBRD focused its
attention on investment in Russia to form a base from which to apply
successes to the other former Soviet republics. As a result, countries like
Ukraine received little benefit from EBRD efforts during the past few years.
By contrast, under Mr de Larosiere's direction, Ukraine has seen evidence
that his professional background as a banker, at the Bank of France and
International Monetary Fund, has had its effect both on local leadership and
in outright results. The bank's current focus in Ukraine on supporting local
investment and banking services has resulted in substantial progress and an
actual extension of com-mitments, especially in the area of financial
institu-tions.
Needless to say, we have found the benefits of this change of leadership and
direction within EBRD to have had a significant effect on fulfilling the
original mission of the agency and on its impact on the developing economies
of its target countries.

FT  18 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Jewish Chronicle can show record of
probing commentary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr NED TEMKO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Gerald Kaufman's review of the newly published history of the Jewish
Chronicle conveys a misleading picture of the book, the newspaper, and of my
predecessor in the editor's chair, Geoffrey Paul (Books: 'Life and times of
a paper tiger', March 12).
Mr Kaufman is right to say that there have been occasions during the
newspaper's long history when it has been reticent to speak out on various
issues - indeed, with benefit of hindsight, perhaps too reticent. Given the
fact that, at 153 years of age, we are the fourth oldest weekly paper in
Britain, that is only to be expected.
But overwhelmingly, our record has been - and continues to be - one of
fiercely guarded editorial independence and consistently probing commentary
on communal, national and international issues. In this, the newspaper is
unique among Jewish publications worldwide, and the equal of the most
distinguished of Britain's national newspapers. The book Mr Kaufman reviewed
makes this point forcefully, also noting the Jewish Chronicle's central role
in a community whose large majority, regardless of political or religious
persuasion, reads the paper each week.
The comment attributed by Mr Kaufman to my predecessor that the newspaper
'could not run ahead of its readership' was made in the context of one quite
specific issue: a deep dispute within the Orthodox Jewish establishment in
the 1960s which led, ultimately, to a schism within it. Indeed, Mr Paul,
himself, spoke out courageously on a number of issues even when this meant
challenging the views of communal institutions, or of readers, a fact
reflected in the often stormy debate that has always marked our letters
pages.

threat (2)
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN M B ASHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Dr Mahathir Bin Mohamad's letter did Britain a service in challenging
the public to stop buying papers which pander to our belief in our own
self-righteousness and subtly appealing to xenophobia. His brilliant letter
also deflected attention from a more serious matter.
Good government must create, operate within and uphold a framework of
justice, a constraint which the press does not share. Penalising UK
companies for the perceived sins of the London press is manifestly unjust,
and does much greater damage to the reputation of Malaysia than The Sunday
Times could ever achieve.
Dr Mahathir is a weighty word-smith. By all means take on our paper tigers
in a war of words, but the injustice done to UK industry will prove a
double-edged sword.

FT  18 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Malaysia - EU should unite against
threat (1)
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MARK HUDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Clearly the government has decided that, in the case of the Malaysian
government's embargo on giving contracts to UK firms, the best course is to
adopt a low profile and hope it all blows over. And prime minister John
Major and foreign secretary Douglas Hurd et al are right - this decision
will be rescinded after a decent interval of time.
However, even from a business perspective, this mousey approach is not
ultimately satisfactory, as it ensures that British business will be more
likely in the future to be damaged by events and press reporting at home -
if governments abroad see that they can use the trade weapon for political
purposes with impunity, they are more likely to do so.
Outside the purely business arena, it is frankly astonishing that a tougher
response, such as the threat of retaliatory trade sanctions, is not being
pressed forcefully by all those concerned with basic freedom and democracy.
The issue should be one in which the EU as a whole could unite to apply a
major threat (though support for Britain is likely to be at a low point in
Brussels due to the debacle over enlargement and the blocking veto).
Malaysia's prime minister Dr Mahathir Bin Mohamad (Letters, March 17) openly
acknowledges that it is the perceived 'vilification and libellous attacks'
in the British press which he cannot stomach. He complains that 'British
newspapers are freely available in Malaysia', but that 'Malaysian newspapers
are not available to the British'. In fact, Malaysian newspapers are freely
available in the UK but are little read because the public does not choose
to do so.
The Malaysian government's clear link between the trade sanctions it has
imposed and the UK's free press is a direct attack on our freedom values. Dr
Mahathir prefers the route of authoritarian force to that of debate. It may
seem only a small affair, but the principles involved demand firmer action
by the British government.

FT  18 MAR 94 / Arts: Fresh view of old Franck - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Belgian composer Cesar Franck wrote four operas, the first and last left
unfinished. Not many people know that; and among those who do, it rarely
crosses their minds. Franck's operas seem to be not just dead, but extinct.
Yet all but the most grudging music-lovers will agree that his violin sonata
and the Symphonic Variations - not to mention the other chamber music, the
symphonic poems, the evergreen Prelude, Chorale &amp; Fugue for piano and the D
minor symphony our parents loved - prove him a considerable master. Why has
his sole full-scale opera Hulda, composed during the same 'high period' in
his early 60s as most of those, been denied serious attention?
University College Opera remembered it on Tuesday, thanks to their inquiring
director David Drummond. (Last performances tonight and tomorrow, at the
Bloomsbury Theatre.) Not only remembered, in French, but restored - in a
recension which claims to give us the uncut original, minus a dispensable
ballet-sequence. At its posthumous premiere, dimly received, Hulda suffered
brusque amputations throughout, and only that version has been published.
Drummond has delved successfully to reinstate the lost parts. On the face of
it, it had always seemed plausible that Hulda might be dead in the water.
The play that Franck's librettist Grandmoujin adapted (by Bjornstjerne
Bjornson, Norway's leading playwright until Ibsen) is a Viking tale of
violent love and gory murder: not natural territory for the church-organist
composer's decorous muse. It was easy to believe the judgments of New Grove
Opera: 'almost wholly lacking in genuine drama'.
Live experience of the integral opera suggests something different. Yes, the
influence of Wagner on the score reminds us that the Master would have
pressed the murderous junctures harder, instead of letting them develop
within a calm, formally deliberate view. But no, that isn't a simple
weakness - not when the structure of each act (five of them) is built so
cogently to accommodate them within a cooller Gallic idiom. Smoothly, of
course - Franck was an ultra-smooth constructor; but within his chosen
guidelines, quite pungent enough.
The old cuts in every act, as Drummond details them in the programme-book,
denied each of them its 'symphonic' beginning, its middle and/or its end. In
his sympathetic hands, the UCL account made us hear how much Franck's
carefully rounded-off forms matter. Climactic passages which might seem
tame, if detached from their contexts, struck home in their proper places.
True, the mostly amateur band had its lapses in pitch and balance and the
UCL choristers sometimes sounded relieved just to find themselves still on
the beat.
The mostly young-pro soloists, however, strove to greater effect. As Hulda,
wrenched by the Aslak tribe from a family whom they have slaughtered, Adele
Paxton grew steadily towards tragic stature. Her faithless Aslak lover Eiolf
had the lusty tenor (and portly frame) of the Australian Julian Gavin, in a
russet suit that did him no favours. Her original captor was the baritone
Tom McVeigh, toughly virile until his early demise. As her might-have-been
Aslak in-laws, Helen Lawrence and Deryck Hamon discovered satisfying
character in their roles.
All that was enough to make one appreciate how good and compelling Franck's
score might seem in a full-blooded production that respected his
period-constraints. Malcolm Hunter's plain staging, in Munch-inspired
designs by Michael Spencer, goes a fair way towards that. If it stops short
of gearing the action rigorously to the music, it goes far enough to show
that Hulda is not a mere museum piece, but a vital period-exhibit. Well
worth catching.

FT  18 MAR 94 / Arts: Wide appeal of intimate Danes - Paul Jeromack reviews
two rewarding exhibitions at the Metropolitan Museum, New York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL JEROMACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Thirty years ago, the thought that any large American museum would want to
exhibit, let alone collect paintings by obscure early 19th century Danish
artists would be considered a joke along the lines of 'Masterpieces of
Bulgarian Portraiture' or 'Albanian Landscape Painting'. The whims of the
art market and the resourcefulness of scholars have combined to change all
that, as can be seen at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in the exhibition The
Golden Age of Danish Painting (till April 24).
Although Danish painting has always had a small band of admirers and
supporters (a Danish show was held at the Jeu de Paume in Paris in 1928)
attention was closely paid only during the market boom of the late 1970s and
early 1980s, when forgotten or neglected painters or schools were seized
upon by an art trade hungry for novelty and quality and a surplus of eager
graduate students and museum curators. In addition, Danish pictures
benefited from the emergence of Biedermeier as a 'hot' style of interior
decoration, their small scale and attractive secular subjects making them
the perfect size for intimate rooms of penthouse apartments.
By the mid-1980s, 19th-century Danish painting became chic, promoted by
fashionable galleries in New York and London. Mindful of their heritage, the
Danes made it increasingly difficult for foreigners to obtain export
licences for top Danish works, making the available supply increasingly
expensive - which of course, added to their appeal. Following the dictum
that 'if it's expensive it must be worth buying', museums including the
Louvre, the National Gallery, London, and the Cleveland, Metropolitan and
Getty museums belatedly began to acquire their first Danish paintings.
In 1984/85 the Grand Palais and the National Gallery, London, hosted the
inevitable exhibition Danish Painting: the Golden Age, and ten years later,
it is the Metropolitan's turn following its premiere at the Los Angeles
County Museum. The LA/Met show is tighter and more coherent than the 1984
exhibition, with masterpieces attractively displayed in five intimate
galleries painted in fashionable Biedermeier colours of plum, coffee and
green.
The 'Golden Age' of Danish painting was relatively brief, lasting only the
first 50 years of the 19th century ironically coinciding with an unusually
bleak spell of economic depression and political unrest in Denmark. Although
most Danish artists made the inevitable trek to Rome, producing many
brilliant oil-sketches of the Italian countryside, once back home they
concentrated on depicting pleasant scenes from daily life, sea vistas filled
with ships with blindingly white sails, landscapes of the countryside, and
numerous portraits.
Perhaps the most various of them was Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg
(1783-1853), a pupil of David in Paris who is represented at the Met by all
of the above, plus a small history painting of 'The Return of Odysseus';
several superb male and female academies; and a disquieting moonlit view of
a bridge down which people are running while two women point with alarm to a
scene outside the picture: the catalogue assumes it to be a fire or an
attempted suicide.
Eckersberg's student, Christen Kobke, now considered the leading figure of
the time, is a more sensitive artist, whose rendering of light and
atmosphere are unsurpassed - as can be seen in his two extraordinary views
of the 'Small Tower on Frederiksborg Castle' and the hazy summer 'View of
Dosseringen with a Group of Rushes in the Foreground'.
Running concurrently with the Danish show is Caspar David Friedrich to
Ferdinand Hodler: A Romantic Tradition, comprising of 19th-century German
and Swiss paintings from the Oskar Reinhart Foundation, Winterthur (closes
April 24, reopens at the National Gallery, London, on June 15).
Even among many sophisticated collectors, most German art has been tainted
by innocent association with the cultural politics of Nazism, which
celebrated the 'noble Aryan' artist from Durer down. Official Nazi
propaganda took its cue from much German 19th-century painting, and when the
Metropolitan bravely hosted an exhibition of this neglected period in 1981,
it was ignored by the public.
In the face of public indifference, the Metropolitan gets credit for trying
German art once again, but unfortunately it is hindered by the private,
uneven quality of the Reinhart pictures, which, as presented, will win no
new fans for this esoteric material.
Unhappily hung on white walls in several large, sprawling galleries, the
Reinhart show is twice as large as it should be, padded and diluted with a
distressing number of uninspired work by mediocre painters and minor works
by major artists: the Reinhart Fuseli, 'Jealousy', is dreadful, inferior to
the the Met's own 'Lapland witches'.
Despite this, there is much to give pleasure and several welcome surprises:
notably the landscapes of icy glaciers and valleys in the Alps by the late
18th-century Swiss, Caspar Wolf, and the crisply painted, sun-drenched
landscapes of Italy and Salzburg by the Austrian Ferdinand Georg Waldmuller.
Friedrich is shown in seven examples, highlighted by the famous 'Chalk
Cliffs on Rugen'. A superb vista of the Unter den Linden in Berlin in 1852
by Eduard Gaertner is a worthy successor to Bellotto's views of Dresden and
Warsaw.
Genre painting is represented by the English city and country views by the
Swiss Jacques-Laurent Agasse and by the small equestrian canvases (populated
with doll-like figures) by Wilhelm von Kobell.
After the mid-19th century, much of the individuality of German painting was
lost as influences from France gradually took hold. Some artists, like
Wilhelm Leibl, were talented enough to translate Courbet's earthy realism
into an individual and incisive style, as seen in two fine portraits and a
large political genre scene of careworn peasants consulting a land register,
but more often than not, the loose brushwork of Manet or Monet becomes a
sloshy and unconvincing mannerism in the hands of Frank Bucher, Max
Liebermann, Max Slevogt, Fritz Schider or Fritz von Uhde.
After this, the innovative work of Arnold Bocklin, and especially Ferdinand
Hodler, are a blessed relief, both painters owing little or nothing to
French influence. Rather, Hodler's female portraits, the 'Convalescent' of
1880 and the 'Portrait of Louise-Delphine Duchosal' of 1885 anticipate
Picasso's rose period of some 20 years later; and his extraordinary
'Surprised by the Storm of 1886', where six fashionable ladies and gentlemen
in a tiny boat form an interlocking chain of icy terror as they cling to
each other as the menacing waves rise about them, recalls the tortured
compositions of Stanley Spencer and Paulo Rego.

Friday is a good night for playing poker or going to the cinema. The rare
item on television that looks vaguely interesting can be left to the video
recorder. When you return, put the cassette on a shelf and leave for three
days. With 99 per cent of programmes no further action will be necessary.
One in a hundred cassettes need setting aside 'for watching one day when
there's nothing else to do'. These need keeping for 30 days before the tape
can be safely re-used.
Among the programmes the VCR could handle tonight are A Song For Europe
(8.00 BBC1); and this month's 174th programme about teenage sex, Public Eye
(8.00 BBC2).
Trendiest of topics at present is cars and the way that people use them. In
addition to BBC2's regular 'Top Gear' we have had Alexei Sayle presenting
'Drive", and the C4 culture series 'Without Walls' is currently showing
'Carnography'. Now here comes From A To B: Tales Of Modern Motoring which
seeks to do for tastes in motoring what 'Signs Of The Times' did for bad
taste in the home (9.30 BBC2).

<TEXT>
The maxim that 'less is more' has always provoked controversy among
designers.
It was coined early this century by the fathers of the modern movement to
convey the principle - often challenged since - that the best design is
always lean.
As from this week, designers in Britain, and their corporate clients, are
being asked to accept the maxim in a different sense: that annual government
design grants totalling Pounds 6m will actually be more effective than the
Pounds 7.5m given for the last few years.
The cut is being accompanied by a shake-up in the way the government
promotes design in industry.
The workforce of the government-funded Design Council, which provides design
services direct to industry, is being cut to about 50 people, less than a
quarter of its present size.
Its provision of consultancy and other services is being transferred to the
Department of Trade and Industry's nascent network of multipurpose business
service centres, known as Business Link. The Design Council will become a
research, education and campaigning organisation.
When the government first outlined these moves six months ago, it seemed
that less would mean less.
At that stage, the DTI wanted to cut the Design Council's annual grant to
about Pounds 3m from Pounds 7.5m. It also planned to give no extra funds to
Business Link, in spite of the expansion of its remit to include the
council's previous services to industry.
Then Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary - who was ill at the
time of last autumn's announcement - decided that if Business Link were to
take on the extra services, it needed more resources. Hence this week's
decision to commit an extra Pounds 2m a year to Business Link over the next
three years, taking its 1994-95 budget from Pounds 17m to Pounds 19m.
Together with the provision of an extra annual Pounds 1m to the 'new' Design
Council, this mitigates the cut in the government's overall spending on
design support to 20 per cent.
Within the new total, the 'less is more' principle will apply: only about
Pounds 1.5m a year will be spent on Design Council fixed costs and
overheads, compared with more than Pounds 6m in the current year, leaving
more funding for design research and promotion.
Behind Heseltine's intervention, it is understood, lies his recognition that
in increasingly tough international markets, high quality and good service
are becoming mere qualifications for competing; they differentiate one
product from another far less than they did as recently as the late 1980s.
As a result, design is becoming a much more important 'differentiator' in
all sorts of industries.
One example of this is the remarkable success of the Rover 600 series of
cars in Britain, and, increasingly, other parts of Europe.
The model is identical to its sister car, the Honda Accord, except in its
interior and exterior design cosmetics, yet these give it a very different
character. This has helped it to outsell the Accord in the UK. The Rover 600
is one of six products to win the Design Council's annual transport awards,
announced yesterday.
A string of examples where industrial design has had a far-reaching impact
on successful products went on show last week at London's Design Museum*.
All the products - except for the Rover - are made by Japanese companies,
but with considerable input by British designers.
Exhibits include NEC's UltraLite Versa Notebook Computer which has more than
quadrupled the Japanese company's share of the booming US notebook market
from 2.5 per cent since its launch a year ago. NEC attributes much of the
product's success to its modular design, on which the company has received
considerable assistance from IDEO, an Anglo-American design consultancy.
*Designed in one - made in the other: new products of collaboration between
Britain and Japan.

FT  18 MAR 94 / Management: From microwave to multimedia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Over the past three years Hewlett-Packard has transformed its oldest
business into the 'point division' for its charge on to the multimedia
information superhighway.
The Stanford Park division grew directly from HP's roots in the scientific
instruments venture formed by Bill Hewlett and David Packard 55 years ago.
'We still had engineering drawings in our manufacturing area with Bill
Hewlett's signature,' recalls Jim Olsen, who heads the newly-named Vid group
(Video Communications Division). 'We've gone from selling microwave
instruments to gearheads (engineering types) to selling video equipment to
men with ponytails and earrings - artists, editors and film producers.'
Vid has become a symbol, within HP, of the capacity to adapt to change. It
is also at the forefront of the company's efforts to draw on the diverse
expertise of its various business groups to create products.
Vid is still part of HP's test and measurement instruments organisation, but
it worked closely with the printer divisions to create the first 'video
printer', producing paper copies of video images that can be used to speed
up editing. Similarly, Vid's 'video server', a video juke box for
interactive television services, incorporates measurement, communications
and computing technologies from various parts of the company.
As the market for multimedia communications products develops, HP may need
to create a business group to focus on it. For the moment the company
prefers to form ad hoc collaborative 'cross-organisation' teams rather than
restructuring its operations.
'If we reorganised HP today to formalise how the divisions work together it
could waste a lot of time,' says Olsen. The biggest change in moving from
microwave to multimedia, he says, has been the accelerated pace of business.
'Product development cycles used to be two to five years, now it is six to
nine months.' When speed becomes critical, corporate structures take a back
seat.

FT  18 MAR 94 / Management: Change while you are ahead - Hewlett-Packard is
in good shape but its chief executive is fighting complacency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Compared with his peers in the computer industry, Lew Platt seems to have a
soft number. When he became chief executive of Hewlett-Packard in October
1992, the US company's revenues and operating earnings were growing
strongly, while other large computer companies were suffering heavy losses.
Yet Platt is not taking life easy. 'One of the tremendous advantages that
I've had is that HP was in fundamentally good shape when I took on this
job,' he says, 'but we can't let ourselves become complacent'.
The fear of being lulled into a false sense of security by HP's current
success is almost an obsession for Platt. 'People ask: 'What do you think
about when you're in the shower or shaving?' Well, I think about how easy it
is to just keep doing what you are doing today for a little bit too long.
'General Motors, Sears, International Business Machines were the greatest
companies in their industries, the best of the best in the world. These
companies did not make gigantic mistakes. They were not led by stupid, inept
people. The only real mistake they made was to keep doing whatever it was
that had made them successful for a little too long.'
Resistance to change is the root cause of the demise of industry-leading
companies, Platt believes. 'The real secret is to build an organisation that
isn't afraid to make changes while it is still successful, before change
becomes imperative for survival.'
For HP, however, there is a strong temptation not to 'rock the boat'. It
recently overtook Digital Equipment to become the second largest US computer
company in terms of revenues. It is now the world market leader in 'open
systems' minicomputers, computer printers, and test and measurement
equipment. It ranks second in the market for computer workstations and
eighth in personal computers.
But getting there was not easy. HP went through a rough patch in the late
1980s and 1990 as it cut back its workforce, reduced bureaucracy and
reorganised its operations several times in search of an efficient
structure.
With hindsight, it seems that HP was ahead of its competitors in making
difficult adjustments to fundamental changes in the computer market. It
'anticipated well necessary changes in technology', says John Jones of
Salomon Brothers, the US broking house.
HP was in the forefront of the shift from proprietary computers to 'open
systems' based on industry standards. The company was the first to implement
Reduced Instruction Set Computing (Risc) technology in mid-range and
mainframe computer systems, providing high performance at lower costs.
HP has also been faster to come to terms with an industry-wide decline in
gross profit margins as computer prices fall. Over the past five years, its
operating expenses have declined from more than 40 per cent of revenues in
1988 to 28 per cent in the first fiscal quarter of 1994 (which ended on
January 31).
Achieving a 'leadership cost structure' in each of its businesses is a top
goal. 'Each business has to stand on its own, be profitable and finance its
own growth,' says Bob Wayman, chief financial officer. 'You make investments
and take your losses for a period, but then you have to test the viability
of a business by its profitability.'
One of HP's core strengths may be that it is founded and run by engineers
who enjoy inventing products. In contrast to its largest competitors, HP
brings new technology to market - even at the risk of cannibalising sales of
its existing products - to maintain competitive advantage.
'Withholding technology or the next price cut may seem like a good way to
maximise profit margins, but it's a deadly game,' says Platt.
Under Platt's leadership 'HP' now also stands for what he calls 'healthy
paranoia'. Managers are urged to be 'always looking over your shoulder at
the competition, always thinking about the next move'.
In HP's prize printer division, this is practised almost to a fault. 'We
sometimes tend not to celebrate our successes as much as we should,' says
Rick Belluzo, head of HP's Computer Products Organisation, which includes
printers and personal computers. The risk is that by focusing too much on
competition, HP could lose sight of what customers really want.
If success has not created a more relaxed environment at HP, it does at
least allow top managers to concentrate on long-term market and technology
trends. Platt has initiated a drive to create products and businesses that
take advantage of the company's unusual combination of technology expertise
in measurement, computing and communications (MCC)  - or 'MC squared' as he
calls it.
Last year, he created an MCC council, composed of top technical and
marketing staff from throughout the company, to identify potential new
'multi-disciplinary' products. 'We're hunting for big game,' says Joel
Birnbaum, head of HP's research laboratories.
To make the most of its different technology groups, Platt is encouraging
'cross-organisational collaboration'. The booming telecommunications market,
for example, is addressed by a marketing team drawn from both the computer
systems organisation and the test and measurement business. Similarly, in
sales and product development, geographic and business organisation
boundaries are being breached.
Platt admits he is unsure whether HP will have to create divisions to
formalise these 'virtual organisations' at some point. For the moment,
however, he seems to be resisting the inevitable upheaval of a
reorganisation. In his 28-year career at HP, he has seen too many.
That does not mean that he is not shaking up HP. 'Whatever we're doing that
made us successful today won't be good in 1996, I can guarantee that,' he
tells his staff. 'It might work in 1994. Maybe it'll even work in 1995, but
it will kill you by 1996.'

FT  18 MAR 94 / Technology: Counting the cost - As electricity deregulation
begins in the UK next month, David Lascelles looks at a new generation of
meters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In a tastefully converted barn at Odiham in Hampshire, a computer screen
shows the map of a residential area north of Bristol. At the touch of a
button, the screen prints up real-time details of electricity consumption in
any of 30 houses in the area - not just voltage, but wattage and whether the
electricity being used is inductive or reactive.
More than that, the computer can print out the consumption record for
several days in 11-minute blocks, providing a detailed history of each
household's life patterns (the exact identity of each household is not
disclosed during demonstrations).
The experiment is being conducted by a new company called Remote Metering
Systems (RMS) in conjunction with SWEB, the Bristol utility, to test a new
generation of metering and communications technology. Each house has a novel
type of electronic meter with a communication device which sends messages
along the electric wires.
This technology is being developed in anticipation of the deregulation of
the electricity market which starts this April and will be completed in
1998. By then, every household in the country will be able to buy its
electricity wherever it wants.
Metering is a key part of the revolution because it will provide the means
to manage an electricity system with multiple suppliers to millions of
households. The electricity will still be delivered to each household down
the wires of the local regional electricity company (REC). But each supplier
will need to know how much power to put into the system to meet customer
needs.
Electricity is already being sold in 30-minute lots to big industrial
customers. Households will probably deal in four-hour lots, but the new
meters will still have to measure their consumption by the half hour because
that is how electricity is traded in the wholesale market.
RMS was formed at the end of 1992 by six electricity companies headed by
Scottish Hydro-Electric and a group of experts in high-speed mains
signalling technology. 'All this has vast implications for the management of
the electricity system, distribution costs and households,' says Nigel
Brown, managing director.
If the Bristol experiment is a success, RMS will install several thousand
remote metering systems in a selected area of Scotland, and commercial
production of the technology will begin. But it is not the only experiment
going on.
Southern Electric, based outside Maidenhead, in Berkshire, and Scottish
Power, have teamed up with Itron, a US company, to adapt 500 meters in both
southern England and Scotland so that they can be read remotely every 30
minutes. Instead of using the mains, these meters will transmit their
signals via satellite and telephone links to computers at the two companies'
headquarters.
Although testing the technology is a key aim of the experiment, one of the
main purposes, according to Stuart Broomfield, Southern's director of
customer services, is to see whether it is commercially feasible. That
points to the real issue: cost.
New electronic meters cost more than Pounds 50 each. Although this cost
would, in the first instance, be borne by the electricity company (household
meters belong to the local distributor), it would ultimately be passed on to
the consumer in the form of higher electricity prices. But why should an REC
want to pay for everyone to have a new meter unless it saw benefits for
itself, possibly in the form of automatic meter reading, or better load
management?
Alternatively, a householder might want to buy a new meter in order to be
able to shop around for electricity. But would he spend, say, Pounds 70 in
order to achieve a 5 per cent saving on a Pounds 300 bill? Traditional
meters cost only Pounds 20 and last 60 years, so the motive to change has to
be strong.
Andrew Forrest, marketing manager for GEC Meters, says: 'Research bears out
that the number of customers seriously interested in saving money is going
to be less than 10 per cent.' GEC is trying to get round the cost problem by
marketing an attachment which can read a standard meter and transmit the
information back to base. This would cost about Pounds 30-Pounds 40,
depending on whether it sent its messages by wire or radio.
Schlumberger Industries, another meter manufacturer, is stressing the
cost-saving aspects of new meters. 'We look at this very much as part of
revenue-collection for suppliers and cost messages for consumers,' says Tom
Mahoney, managing director.
A further cost is the transmission of the data. RMS says its form of power
line communication system costs about Pounds 12 to install, in addition to
the meter.
But Forrest is doubtful about power line technology: 'It works out more
expensive than you'd expect, and it's fraught with technical difficulties.'
He favours the telephone system. Brown agrees that his technology may be
more expensive than, for example, radio, but he emphasises the value of a
two-way communication system which can not only read the meter but also give
it instructions.
The electronic link could be used to provide alarm services, or enable
electricity suppliers to offer interruptible supplies to consumers who were
willing to have inessential equipment switched off at peak hours in exchange
for lower tariffs.
All forms of meters would also enable householders to have live meters on
the kitchen wall showing exactly how much electricity they are using at any
time.
At the moment, though, the market is at a standstill because all potential
purchasers of new meters are waiting to see the rules of the pricing game.
These are being determined by Stephen Littlechild, the electricity industry
regulator, who is conducting a review of electricity distribution pricing
which will be completed in the summer.
In a discussion document on metering two years ago, he hinted that the
review might produce changes in the electricity pricing formula to enable
electricity companies to recoup the cost of installing new meters.
Littlechild believes modern meters hold the key to a competitive market.

FT  18 MAR 94 / Technology: Oilseed fuel on trial
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK's first trial to assess the commercial prospects for refining oilseed
rape into biodiesel begins this month. Farmway, an agricultural
co-operative, plans to produce 25,000 litres of biodiesel at a Chemoxy
refinery on Teesside in north-east England.
The co-op will then test the fuel in one of its vehicles and three of its
cars for several months.
Further trials are being conducted by another farm co-op, United Oilseeds,
which is running three of its cars on imported biodiesel for a year. The car
emissions will be checked to see whether the fuel holds environmental
benefits over conventional diesel.
Farmers are looking at the prospects of finding a fuel market for produce
grown on land set aside as part of the European Union's Common Agricultural
Policy reforms. This land cannot be used for food crops.
Other countries in the EU, such as France and Italy, have established a
market for fuels refined from oilseeds. But to compete with conventional
fuels, these products need government tax breaks.
The European Commission has proposed that biodiesel and other similar
products attract lower rates of duty. However, the British government has
pointed to the lack of trial data in the UK.
Martin Farrow, managing director of United Oilseeds, does not expect
biodiesel to achieve mass market status. 'But there is potential for its use
in environmentally sensitive areas, urban transport systems, buses, taxis
and waterways.'
The fuel is expected to be 10p a litre more expensive than conventional
diesel. Some users, on waterways, for example, may be prepared to pay for a
more environmentally friendly product. Diesel spills in waterways can cause
greater environmental damage than biodiesel which disperses within weeks.

FT  18 MAR 94 / People: Dawson goes Dutch
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Peter Dawson (right), who over the past six years has built up the
commercial vehicle hire and distribution company Dawsongroup to a market
capitalisation of Pounds 172m, is going Dutch. Today Dawson, who still owns
almost 65 per cent of the shares, resigns as executive chairman to become
chairman and managing director of the two-week-old Dawsongroup International
in Rotterdam.
Dawson's caution and conservatism have allowed him to prosper in a field
that has seen many casualties during the recession. He felt that the group
needed to expand internationally, but was unable to find any better way than
to do it himself. Rotterdam is the ideal place to start, he thinks, since
not only is it a good centre for transport but also an outlet for the Dutch
dairy and market garden industries. By the end of the year he hopes the
Dutch division will have 25 portable cold storage units and 25 trailers. As
with every other development at Dawsongroup, of which he remains a director,
he likes to start small and grow.
Michael Williams, a veteran of 18 years with Dawsongroup, took over as chief
executive last November. The new chairman is Tony Frendo, 46, who was until
recently with Argyll as managing director, finance and administration, at
Safeway Stores.

Timber grown and sawn in Britain should in future carry a symbol
guaranteeing that it was harvested under licence on the basis of sustainable
forestry, if a scheme launched this week is successful, writes James Buxton.
The Woodmark scheme, introduced by the Forestry Industry Committee of Great
Britain, aims to meet public demand that consuming timber does not mean
depleting forests. This demand has risen since Britain accepted forestry
resolutions at the Rio Earth Summit in 1992.
From the middle of this year sawmills should stamp every plank of British
wood with the Woodmark if they are satisfied that it was appropriately
harvested.

FT  18 MAR 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Freezing technology creates
novel lollies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DELLA BRADSHAW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As summer approaches, food manufacturers may be interested in a novel
freezing technology which could produce
intricately-shaped iced lollies.
Today most lollies are frozen in the mould, which is then heated quickly to
release the product. This method results in the lolly losing shape and
definition.
The latest freezing technology, developed in Basingstoke by Air Products,
relies on the principle of zero adhesion, where the surface is so cold that
nothing will stick to it.
By chilling lolly moulds to at least -80`C using liquid nitrogen,
intricately-shaped and coloured lollies can be produced.
The company has already developed lollies in the shape of a fried egg and a
light bulb.

For many upgradeable PCs, replacing the old processor chip with the latest

Californian company General Micro Systems has now launched a machine which

transport data at a rate of 320 Megabytes a second - far faster than
required by today's processors. The Predator, sold in Europe by FPS, of

For a glimpse of future desktop computer design, look at Sun Microsystems'
Voyager workstation, writes Louise Kehoe.
It features a 12-in, tilting, active-matrix, colour, flat-panel display that
can be folded against the vertical computer housing for storage.
The unit takes up about one-third of the desk space of a traditional
workstation and because of its small size and weight is expected to appeal
to people in financial services, or field workers such as consultants,
analysts or auditors.
The display uses one-tenth of the power of a typical workstation and adds
about Dollars 5,000 (Pounds 3,425) to the price.

Oleg Popov, director-general of Zarubezneft, a Russian state oil company,
has joined the board of directors of Aminex, a small exploration and

Zarubezneft owns 49 per cent of East West Oil, which in turn owns almost 40
per cent of Aminex, which is involved in a production project in the Komi
Republic.
Brian Hall, the chairman, says the strong Russian involvement in Aminex has
opened doors for the company in that country. Popov will be the second

Chris Greig, who was chief executive of Invergordon Distillers until it was
taken over by Whyte &amp; Mackay, a subsidiary of American Brands, last
November, is returning to the whisky industry. He has become a non-executive
director of William Grant &amp; Sons, the family-owned company which makes
Glenfiddich, the UK's leading single malt.
Greig says it feels good to be back with 'a Scottish independent', William
Grant being one of the last big players in the Scotch whisky industry to fit
that description. 'Being entirely owned by the Grant family allows it to
concentrate on building a long-term, quality business without the
distractions which takeover bids create,' he says.
William Grant only recently decided to appoint non-executive directors.
Earlier this year it brought in Patrick Thomas, managing director of Hermes
in Paris.
The 59-year-old Greig, who led the 1988 management buyout of Invergordon
from Hawker Siddeley and floated it in 1990, has also joined the board of
Robert Wiseman Dairies, the Scottish liquid milk processor and distributor
which is coming to the stock market this month.

Walter Hayes is joining the board of Dagenham Motors, the London and
south-east of England Ford dealer group, as a non-executive director.
Hayes, once-upon-a-time editor of the Sunday Dispatch, vice president of
Ford Motor, deputy chairman of Ford of Europe and close confidant of Henry
Ford II, retired from Ford in 1989, aged 65.
Having written 'Henry', a biography of Henry Ford II, he returned to the
Ford world in 1990 as a member of the board of Aston Martin, the UK luxury
sports car maker, which he helped persuade Ford to take over in 1987.
As executive chairman of Aston Martin from 1991 he has been instrumental in
transforming the often-chequered fortunes of the sports car group with the
development of a new range of sports cars, the Aston Martin DB7, which goes
into production next month.
Hayes, 70 in April, has just retired from the Aston Martin chairmanship but
remains as a non-executive director.

FT  18 MAR 94 / People: Burgin joins Max and Polly at Bluebird
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mighty Max has a fairly low City profile, nothing to do with his height of
less than one inch. Max is one of Bluebird Toys' success stories, a
miniature figure now selling in 60 countries, along with Polly Pocket and
other tiny creatures aimed at capturing children's hearts. Max and Polly
have just got a new boss, Christopher Burgin, 44, who has been made chief
executive of the company.
Burgin has been picked by Bluebird's founder, Torquil Norman, 61, who is
giving up the chief executive's job - but remaining as chairman - to
concentrate on new product development.
Angus Fisher, group operations director for the past four and a half years,
is leaving. Norman says that because of the board restructuring, Bluebird
'needed someone with more of a marketing background as chief executive', but
adds that the parting with Fisher was amicable.
Burgin will be working closely with Norman and also David Laxton, whose
title is technical director but who Norman says plays a much greater and
vital role in product development than the title reveals.
Bluebird has gone through its ups and downs. Established in 1980, voted
British toy manufacturer of the year in 1984, it was listed on the USM in
1985. It seemed unable to put a foot wrong, until in 1991 its shares
nosedived from a 1987 peak of 506p to 26p; losses hit Pounds 3.5m, partly a
result of the Gulf War but also from a failure to keep a tight grip on
inventories.
These days it's flying high again; its shares have moved from 178p to a
recent high of 842p over the past 12 months; profits rose to Pounds 9.8m
from Pounds 1.5m, while sales increased 50 per cent to Pounds 69m.
Now Max has been adopted by a television production company; 40 half-hour
animations are booked for the US, Bluebird's second biggest market.
The appointment of Burgin, who has an 18-year background in the industry
with toy giant Hasbro, ultimately as Hasbro UK's group sales and marketing
director managing brands such as Trivial Pursuit, Action Man and Play-Doh,
comes at a moment when Bluebird looks set to fly further.

FT  18 MAR 94 / The Property Market: Market slow to buy retail stock
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The revival in property share prices promised to make this spring a golden
opportunity for property companies to join the stock market. But this week's
placing and open offer by Capital Shopping Centres, a Pounds 830m retail
company, met with a lukewarm response.
CSC is the retail property arm of TransAtlantic, the insurance and property
group. Its sponsor, Robert Fleming, has succeeded in placing 65 per cent of
the Pounds 209m-worth of shares on offer with institutions, the remainder
being on offer to the public until March 23. However, few analysts expect
the shares to provide quick profits.
The problem is not that the company lacks attractions. It will be the sixth
largest property company on the market and, as the owner of seven of the
UK's most prominent shopping centres, it is the market's only large retail
sector specialist.
Moreover, its high-quality assets, low level of borrowings and good rental
growth prospects should ensure a steady rise in its income. Mr David
Tunstall of Smith New Court, brokers, says it has 'the best dividend growth
prospects of any company in the sector'.
One reason why the company has not caught the market's imagination is that
this is not the first time shareholders have been offered minority shares in
TransAtlantic's property interests. CSC is composed of the retail property
interests of Capital &amp; Counties, a long-established property group, which
was listed on the stock exchange until 1992 when TransAtlantic acquired its
minority interests.
But the main reason is the offer is perceived to be too expensive. The
shares have been priced at a 13 per cent premium to net asset value, which
looks expensive compared with the rest of the sector.
Mr Chris Turner of BZW believes that the company's lack of gearing will hold
back growth in its net asset value. Even a 25 per cent rise in property
values over the next two years might be insufficient to stimulate a rise in
share price - if property shares return to being valued at a substantial
discount to asset values.
These criticisms rile Mr Donald Gordon, the company's chairman. 'They don't
realise it is a situation with tremendous upwards potential.'
Mr Gordon contends that the company's valuers have underestimated the true
worth of the company's assets.
According to the prospectus, the directors 'do not believe that . . . this
value properly reflects the long-term investment worth of the regional
shopping centres in the London area'.
Their argument carries a certain weight, as shopping centres have tended to
perform relatively well compared with competitors in the high street.
But investors are concerned about a possible competitive threat to CSC's
flagship centre, a 1.32m sq ft shopping centre at Thurrock, which accounts
for about half its total assets. Blue Circle, the cement company, has drawn
up plans for a rival shopping centre, Bluewater Park, at Dartford in Kent.
Analysts estimate that the close proximity of the rival centre could take 20
per cent of Thurrock's shoppers.
Mr Gordon is sanguine about the rival scheme. 'I personally would welcome
some competition,' he says. 'We have a vast educational problem in
re-educating the shopping public that shopping is a joy to do instead of
being a chore.'

FT  18 MAR 94 / The Property Market: Perplexing new phase - Vanessa Houlder
on the impact of converging gilt and property yields
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The property investment market is approaching a watershed. The gap between
gilt yields and property yields is starting to close.
The reason is twofold: the sharp fall in gilt values over the past six
weeks, in which 20-year gilt yields have risen by one percentage point to
7.4 per cent, and the rapid surge in property values over the past nine
months.
Property yields are still being driven downwards by the weight of money
being directed towards the sector.
Average property yields, which stood at 9.2 per cent in February 1993, are
likely to fall to below 7.5 per cent at some point over the next month,
according to Mr Greg Nicholson of Hillier Parker, chartered surveyors.
This presents a conundrum for property investors. Investors have tended to
view high-yielding properties with secure, long-term income streams as a
substitute to investing in bonds.
As a result, much of the driving force for last year's drop in property
yields was the decline in bond yields.
The close relationship displayed by bond and property yields last year
suggests that property yields could be dragged up by the current rise in
bond yields.
But this seems unlikely.
Most analysts believe that property yields will sink beneath gilt yields, as
investor confidence increases about the prospects for growth in property
rents.
This scenario, after all, would merely be a return to the traditional
relationship between gilt and property yields.
Many property owners believe that property values have nothing to lose from
an increase in inflation. An inflation-induced rise in rental values would
be expected to compensate for the impact of the likely rise in gilt yields.
Nonetheless, the erosion of the gap between gilt and property yields may
dampen investor enthusiasm. Some investment decisions have been based on
demanding projections for rental growth.
Yet, so far, there is little sign of rental increases in even the best
property - although some of the incentives such as rent-free periods offered
to tenants are beginning to diminish.
If the closing of the yield gap causes investors to believe that property is
self-evidently cheap, some of the froth may be taken off the top of the
market.
At present, there is still a scramble to buy property. The result is that
values are being chased upwards - in many cases well above the asking price.
'It is a bit like being in a casino. Quoting terms bear no relation to the
ultimate sale price,' says Mr Nicholson.
If some of the heat is taken off the market, investors who have seen large
capital uplifts over the past 18 months, may be willing to sell up and take
profits.
If this happens, a reduction in the the shortage of property, which has
helped drive up prices, will enable a much greater equilibrium in the
market.
The properties which are most vulnerable to a cooling of the market are high
yielding buildings where tenants are locked into paying well above market
rents for long leases.
As investors have become more concerned about prospects for rental growth,
there has been a lessening of interest in these over-rented properties.
Moreover, since many investors viewed the high, secure income streams
offered by these properties as substitutes for bonds, they are likely to be
more sensitive than on average to increases in bond yields.
But for most types of property, the likelihood is that any further rises in
the bond yields, if modest, will slow the property price rises rather than
put them into reverse.

FT  18 MAR 94 / Legal move on Crest deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Treasury believes it will be necessary to alter the UK Companies Act in
order to protect shareholders settling their trades through the Crest system
for paperless settlement which is under development by the Bank of England.
Because share ownership will no longer be demonstrable by the production of
share certificates, there will have to be new regulations to protect those
who buy and sell shares.
Crest should have the authority to take legal action against participants
who cause losses through negligence, fraud or by going into default.
The Treasury has also proposed:
Removing the obligation of a company to issue a share certificate to a
shareholder, but only in instances where the shareholder indicates he does
not wish to receive one.
A new legal structure to protect buyers of securities in a paperless system
during the period between striking the bargain and the settlement date. A
law to give buyers a so-called 'equitable interest' in the shares they have
purchased as soon as a registrar has received instructions for a transfer of
ownership. If the registrar is unable to complete the transfer of ownership,
the buyer will still have a claim.

has been struggling to find European component suppliers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Mr Terry Davies, purchasing director for Panasonic Europe's television
division, may be on the verge of a breakthrough. He believes he has found a
local source for screws, nuts, bolts and washers - two decades after
Panasonic's parent, Matsushita of Japan, established colour television
manufacturing operations on Cardiff's Pentwyn Industrial Estate.
For 20 years the Cardiff plant, which makes 500,000 sets a year, has
imported fastenings from Japan. Local manufacturers simply do not turn out a
broad enough range of fixings in sufficient volume to compete on price with
Japanese makers.
Companies such as Matsushita are anxious to buy from local companies - which
means anywhere in Europe. The company spends Pounds 140m a year on goods,
including video cabinets from Germany, plastics from Sweden and packaging
from the UK. In Cardiff the 21-strong purchasing department is continually
looking for additions to Panasonic's list of 150 suppliers.
There are sound political reasons for Panasonic's policy. The company wants
to be seen as a good Euro-citizen, helping avoid trade friction and giving
business to local suppliers.
There are also good commercial reasons - for example, delivery of a new
design of component from the Far East can take five to six months, compared
with a few weeks for the same component sourced locally.
The Panasonic experience suggests that things have improved since the days
when manufacturers such as International Business Machines of the US
complained bitterly that they could not buy components of adequate quality
locally.
But there are still trouble spots and it seems unlikely that some components
will ever be sourced in Europe.
Last year about 72 per cent by value of the contents of Panasonic Europe's
televisions, up to 33in screen size, came from European suppliers. The
lion's share is picture tubes - representing about 40 per cent of the value
of a set - from Philips of the Netherlands and Thomson of France.
Mr Davies says he wants to increase local content to 82 per cent by 1996,
leaving 11 per cent from south-east Asia and 7 per cent from Japan.
The electronic cornerstone of the television set - the printed circuit board
 -is a case in point. Last year Panasonic sourced all its boards from Japan
and south-east Asia. Mr Davies hopes to buy 25 per cent from Belgium by
1996.
The plant used to buy all boards locally, but stopped because of poor
quality. Now the problem is quantity. Cardiff can use up to 22,000 boards a
day in peak months and local suppliers have been unable to meet the volumes
required.
The most safety-critical component in a colour television set is the flyback
transformer, which generates the thousands of volts needed to drive the
picture gun.
Cardiff buys more than 75 per cent from Japan and south-east Asia, and about
23 per cent from Mieco, a Matsushita subsidiary in East Kilbride,
Lanarkshire. The plan is that by 1996 55 per cent of transformers will come
from East Kilbride.
Mr Leahy says statutory standards for transformers are higher in Japan than
in Europe and Mieco builds to Japanese quality. Replacing Mieco's products
from a European-owned company would not be a priority.
Similarly, he will 'never' buy electrolytic capacitors, devices which store
electric charge, from Europe.
The complicated mouldings for the cabinets also come from expatriate
Japanese companies - Diaplastics of Bridgend and Munekta in Dublin.
Mr Davies says Panasonic's insistence on quality and reliability has
markedly improved suppliers' performance.
Yet he still detects a greater willingness among Asian companies to make the
extra effort to satisfy his needs compared with their European competitors.

FT  18 MAR 94 / Top insolvency watchdog plans 3-yearly checks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The largest of the UK's newly created bodies for regulating insolvency
practitioners plans to examine all 1,200 professionals under its charge in
the next five years.
It also plans to inspect every active insolvency practitioner - about
three-quarters of the total - every three years, it said yesterday.
The details were revealed by Miss Kay Linnell, who was appointed chief
executive of the Joint Insolvency Monitoring Unit on Monday.
The unit will take responsibility for monitoring the practitioners licensed
by the Insolvency Practitioners Association, the Institute of Chartered
Accountants in England and Wales, and the members outside Scotland of the
Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland.
The three bodies, which retain control of licensing and disciplining their
members, respectively hold three, four and one seat on the board. They will
pay a contribution to the unit based on their number of practitioners.
Miss Linnell said she planned to hire two support staff and about eight
inspectors, who would examine about 100 practitioners each year.
She said the unit would consider basic compliance with regulations,
subjective areas such as whether litigation should have been commenced, and
wider topics including fees charged. 'Our motto is to be firm but fair,' she
said.
The unit was set up after monitoring by the government insolvency service
found a high proportion of practitioners failing to meet legal obligations.

FT  18 MAR 94 / Accountancy groups retreat from merger plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Growing signs of dissent are emerging among the UK's six principal
accountancy bodies as they prepare a statement proposing a restructuring of
the profession which could lead to a merger.
At least half the bodies are expected to issue letters to their members in
the next few days expressing disapproval of the statement or at the least
failing to endorse its conclusions.
The statement calls for the combination of the six bodies into three
regional institutes of chartered accountants, with all members sharing the
designation 'chartered accountant'.
In an effort to present a single proposal for the future, none is expected
to veto the statement when it is discussed on Monday by the consultative
committee of accountancy bodies, which represents the six groups.
It comes after nearly a year of talks in a working group chaired by Mr David
Bishop, a partner with KPMG Peat Marwick. Each body will consult its members
and report in November.
The Chartered Association of Certified Accountants inflamed the debate last
night when Mr Kenneth Duncan, its president, said at its annual dinner that
an immediate merger would not work and called instead for closer
co-operation under the existing structure.
The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland is opposed to a merger
and has been angered by the Bishop group's failure to discuss its
alternative proposals in detail.
The Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy is expected to
take a neutral position on the statement. The Institute of Chartered
Accountants in England and Wales, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in
Ireland, and the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants are mainly in
favour.
The statement, which contains 12 'principles', calls for common assessment
standards and common entry standards for education and training.
It says the three new bodies would co-operate closely on issues of common
interest, such as international policy and education, through a successor
body to the existing consultative committee.
It recommends that this committee should include lay members for
consideration of issues in the public interest such as practice regulation,
ethics, discipline and professional standards.

FT  18 MAR 94 / High prices may create gas surplus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A surplus of natural gas could arise in 1996-1997 because high prices are
encouraging producers in the North and Irish Seas to develop new reserves,
British Gas says.
Mr Colin Friedlander, director of UK and western European operations for
British Gas exploration and production, said gas prices 'remain reasonable'
because of the government's decision in December to open up the residential
market to competition. A number of new gas marketing companies, such as the
gas subsidiaries of the regional electricity companies, are securing
supplies in expectation of entering the market, which will be liberalised in
early 1996.
Power generators are also still negotiating contracts for supplies to fuel
some of the gas-fired plants being built or planned.
In recent years North Sea producers have put a priority on developing gas
fields, largely to meet 'dash for gas' demand from power generators. Mr
Friedlander said a recent lull in the announcement of new gas-fired power
generation projects had not deterred a number of gas producers from
continuing to be 'bullish' about bringing extra supplies to market.
A report this month by Wood Mackenzie, the energy consultants, said some gas
fields being considered for development could be delayed by insufficient
demand towards the end of the decade.
Mr Friedlander said development of the largest new gas fields should not be
affected by any 'temporary' surplus in 1996-1997.
The proposed pipeline linking Bacton in Norfolk to Zeebrugge in Belgium is
expected to be operational in 1997 to carry surplus UK gas to European
markets.

FT  18 MAR 94 / Emergency insolvency legislation to go through Commons on
Monday
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Emergency insolvency legislation to clarify the employment obligations of
companies in receivership and administration will go through the House of
Commons on Monday, the Department of Trade and Industry said yesterday.
The insolvency bill will go through the House of Lords on Tuesday and should
complete most of its parliamentary stages next week.
The bill, which is to be retrospective from last Tuesday, was announced
following concern after an appeal court ruling on Paramount Airways.
It will state that if there have been no new employment contracts agreed
after 14 days of the receivership or administration of a company, only
wages, salaries and pensions contributions will rank as secured creditors.

FT  18 MAR 94 / Truck output rise of 7% gives little cause for joy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Statistics yesterday showing a 7 per cent year-on-year rise in commercial
vehicle production in February - only the third monthly increase to be
recorded since mid-1992 - brought little comfort yesterday to an industry
seeking to recover from its steepest recession on record.
The apparent improvement mainly reflects a sharp fall in production in the
previous February, as a result of the collapse into receivership that month
of the Anglo-Dutch Daf trucks and vans group.
Yesterday's statistics, issued by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and
Traders and the Central Statistical Office, showed car production to be
higher last month than a year ago, but only by 2.73 per cent.
Both sectors have been affected by last year's severe slump in continental
European car and commercial vehicle sales, which have shown only faint signs
of revival.
The statistics show that February commercial vehicle output totalled 19,557,
a rise of 7.02 per cent from the previous February's 18,275.
This brought output for the first two months of this year to 36,048, a
decline of 2.80 per cent on the year-ago period's 37,088. Production for
export last month was 15.47 per cent lower, at 8,704, compared with the
previous February's 10,297.
A strengthening recovery in the UK commercial vehicle market, as well as
Daf's problems last year, was is reflected in output for the domestic
market. It totalled 10,853 last month, a 36 per cent rise from the previous
February's 7,978.
Car output last month was 114,121, compared with the previous February's
111,091. Output for export was down 10.22 per cent on the previous year, at
44,188. But for the domestic market it was 13.02 per cent higher at 69,933.
Sales of vans and other light commercial vehicles bought on hire purchase or
other forms of finance leapt by more than half last month.
Finance sales of new light commercial vehicles rose 51.2 per cent and
finance sales of used commercials jumped 52.6 per cent. Statistics from HPI,
the vehicle credit information organisation, show a 47.8 per cent rise in
finance sales of used heavy commercial vehicles, and a rise of 22 per cent
in finance sales of new heavy commercial vehicles.

FT  18 MAR 94 / Minister condemns boundary proposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By:BY JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Forsyth, the employment minister, yesterday denounced Boundary
Commission proposals which would remove part of his Stirling constituency
and would, in the view of some political observers, cost him victory there
at the next general election.
Mr Forsyth said the revised proposals to transfer Bridge of Allan and
Stirling University from Stirling constituency to the new Ochil constituency
were 'ludicrous' and would tear the heart out of the constituency. He would
be arguing for a second inquiry by the commission.
'I will be fighting not for the Conservative interest but for the integrity
of the Stirling constituency as a whole,' he said.
Mr Forsyth, who was a controversial Scottish Office minister and for a year
chairman of the Scottish Conservative party, had a majority of 703 in the
1992 general election. The disputed ward has a Conservative regional
councillor and some local observers believe its transfer to Ochil - likely
to be Labour-dominated - could cost the Tories between 1,100 and 2,000
votes.
The Stirling decision, which followed an inquiry, added to dismay among
Scottish Tories that boundary changes do not appear to be working in their
favour as they had hoped they would.
The Conservatives hold only 11 of the 72 Scottish seats, in spite of winning
26 per cent of the Scottish vote in 1992.
Last month the Boundary Commission backtracked on a decision - which had
been thought likely to benefit the Tories - to abolish one of the two
Liberal Democrat-held seats in the Borders.
Yesterday Mr John Curtice, a lecturer in politics at the university of
Strathclyde, said he believed Mr Forsyth would hold Stirling on the new
boundaries with a halved majority. He pointed out that the Conservative
regional councillor had won the ward with only a third of the vote.
But he estimated that the boundary changes in Scotland would probably lead
to the Conservatives making a net loss of one seat at the next election,
assuming people voted in the same pattern as in 1992. They would lose Ayr,
held by Mr Phil Gallie MP, to Labour, and Aberdeen South, held by Mr Raymond
Robertson, to the Liberal Democrats, but would gain the new seat to be
created in Grampian region.

FT  18 MAR 94 / British Coal to cut 320 more jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Coal is to cut at least 320 jobs at its Harworth, Nottinghamshire,
colliery, in a move which signals significant further restructuring of the
industry before privatisation later this year and in 1995.
Although British Coal has completed the bulk of the rationalisation which
started 18 months ago, it is thought that two or three more of the 17 pits
now in operation will be closed in the next few months.
Those believed to be most under threat are Bilsthorpe, in Nottinghamshire,
Tower and Point of Ayr, in Wales, and Prince of Wales and Kiveton, in
Yorkshire. Closures or rationalisations are likely to be signalled next
month in meetings convened under the industry's colliery review procedure.
Managers in the corporation's Midlands group told unions at Harworth that in
future only 550 miners plus a 'minimal number' of contractors would be
needed at the pit. There are 870 employees and 400 contractors.
Mr John Longden, Midlands group director, said production this financial
year had not reached the forecast of 2.3m tonnes and costs were high. The
pit would be restructured over the next year, and after that annual output
was expected to be about the same as it had been this year.
Mr Longden stressed that Harworth remained 'an important part of our plans
for the future. I am confident that the plan outlined today will secure the
prospects for Harworth.'
The pit had already broken its annual production record by this week passing
the 2m-tonne mark for the first time, said Mr Longden.
Under the restructuring plan the pit will work a single face rather than
several at a time.
The latest cut in jobs will leave fewer than 10,000 miners employed in the
industry. In October 1992, more than 40,000 miners worked for British Coal
at 50 pits.
In addition to the 17 pits in operation, British Coal is planning to open
the Asfordby pit in Leicestershire next year. Another, Maltby in the
Yorkshire region, is being restructured and will merge with Silverwood next
year.
The closure of five other pits since the start of the year has removed
annual production of about 8m tonnes. From next month, however, annual sales
to the two large electricity generators, PowerGen and National Power, will
fall by 10m tonnes.
With stockpiles of coal well above what British Coal and the generators
consider their commercial or strategic requirements, further rationalisation
is inevitable.
Meanwhile, Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, has told the House of Commons that
the UK imported a total of 18.4m tonnes - worth Pounds 687m - last year,
according to provisional government figures.
The US was the biggest supplier, with 4.3m tonnes. Australia supplied 4.1m
tonnes, Colombia 2.5m tonnes, Poland 1.7m tonnes, South Africa 781,000
tonnes, Russia 713,000 tonnes and Canada 632,000 tonnes.

FT  18 MAR 94 / Property deal by ex-Rosehaugh chief blocked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Rail and BICC, the construction group, have blocked an ambitious
attempt by Mr Godfrey Bradman, former chairman of collapsed developer
Rosehaugh, to re-enter the property development market.
Mr Bradman, in partnership with Lord Young, Cable &amp; Wireless chairman and
former trade secretary, leads a consortium which planned to build a Pounds
300m retail and residential development on a derelict 35-acre site at White
City in west London.
Mr Bradman, one of the most aggressive developers of the 1980s, whose
company Rosehaugh went into receivership in 1992, persuaded London Regional
Transport to sell him half the site, but the development was conditional on
the purchase of the rest, owned by BICC and BR. They have decided to accept
an offer from J. Sainsbury, the supermarket group, and Bride Hall, a
property developer.
Mr Peter Zinkin, a BICC director, said Mr Bradman had been 'extraordinarily
difficult' during the negotiations. Mr Bradman agreed that his relationship
with Mr Zinkin had become strained.
Mr David Hunter, property director of Scottish Amicable, which was providing
Pounds 100m for Mr Bradman's scheme, said Mr Bradman 'has alienated too many
executives'. Mr Hunter added, however, that BR and BICC were passing up a
great opportunity.
Correspondence from Mr William Myers, director of the Environment Department
at Hammersmith council, indicates that Mr Bradman's scheme would have been
more likely to gain planning permission than is Sainsbury's. Mr Bradman said
LRT would be between Pounds 50m and Pounds 70m better off under his
proposal. He has written to Mr Steven Norris, the transport minister, and
Sir John Bourn, the comptroller and auditor-general, urging them to
intervene to maximise proceeds for the public sector.
Mr Malcolm Vince, of the British Rail Property Board, said BR's property
adviser, Hillier Parker, concluded that the 'public purse in aggregate
(funds to be received both by BR and LRT) would not lose out'. BR and BICC
are hopeful that when LRT's agreement with Mr Bradman expires, LRT will join
their scheme. Sir Robin Biggam, BICC chairman, said: 'Doing a deal with
Sainsbury is far better for shareholders'.
Mr Zinkin agreed that Hammersmith was likely to pass a preliminary
resolution in favour of Mr Bradman's proposal in the coming few months, but
he was less confident about the timing and terms of the grant of formal
planning permission for Mr Bradman's scheme.
He also pointed out that Mr Bradman still needed to raise an estimated
Pounds 200m from banks, which might prove difficult.
Mr Hunter said he had no doubt that any additional capital could be raised.

FT  18 MAR 94 / London radio talks may reopen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LBC, the London commercial radio station due to go off the air in October,
is trying to reopen talks with London News Radio, the company that won both
its licences last year.
The move to reopen the talks follows LBC's failure this week to win the
national commercial licence for a predominantly speech service.
There is growing doubt whether Talk Radio UK, the highest bidder with Pounds
3.8m, will be awarded the licence because its bid may be too high to be
financially viable - but LBC, which was fourth in the bidding, stands no
chance.
LBC, in effect owned by Bank of Scotland, could take a stake in LNR, which
has not yet announced that it is fully funded. If agreement could be reached
LNR could use existing LBC studios and some of its staff, avoiding an abrupt
transition when the new company takes over.
If agreement cannot be reached, an application by LBC for one of the four
new London-wide frequencies due to become available at the beginning of next
year has not been ruled out.
Meanwhile, it emerged yesterday that Dame Shirley Porter, the controversial
former Conservative politician, had resigned as chairman of LBC on Tuesday.

FT  18 MAR 94 / Swans at risk in MoD order delay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Swan Hunter, the Tyneside shipbuilder in receivership, faces a damaging
four-month wait to hear whether it has won a Ministry of Defence order
crucial to its future.
The MoD said yesterday it would not decide until July which company had won
the refit of the Sir Bedivere landing ship, for which the tender deadline is
next Thursday.
Swan Hunter's receiver, Price Waterhouse, which is optimistic of receiving
at least one bid for the company before Thursday, expects any bids to be
conditional on the award of Sir Bedivere, an 18-month contract which could
be worth around Pounds 30m.
But as one of the two remaining frigates at Swan Hunter - the company's only
current orderbook - will be completed and handed over in mid-May, more
redundancies may then be inescapable if the refit award remains uncertain.
With the workforce already cut by nearly 1,500 to 1,038 since receivership
in May last year, additional redundancies could threaten the 'golden nugget'
of skilled Swan Hunter employees which the receivers have described as the
'essence' of the business they are seeking to sell. Yet for Swan Hunter's
bid to have a chance of success, it must be underwritten by a prospective
purchaser guaranteeing completion to cost and on time.
Mr Ed James, joint receiver, said earlier this week that he hoped the MoD
would take the minimum time necessary to consider the tenders.
Six tenders are likely for the refit. The MoD said three to four months was
needed to assess them properly. A spokesman said: 'It certainly won't be
before then.'
On Monday Swan Hunter union leaders, who see the Sir Bedivere refit as
crucial to Swan Hunter's survival, launch a three-day lobbying campaign at
Westminster. They are targeting 139 Conservative MPs in whose constituencies
there are companies which work for Swans or could do so.

FT  18 MAR 94 / School start-age suggestion is 'absurd'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Patten, the education secretary, dismissed as 'absurd' a suggestion
that the school starting age should be raised from five to six to finance
universal nursery education.
Mr Patten said: 'I have no intention at all of bringing forward plans for
compulsory schooling for three and four-year-olds.'
The suggestion was made yesterday in a report from the Royal Society of Arts
which also suggested that parents should be required to sign a contract to
stay together until their children reach 16.
The current provision of pre-school education was 'little short of a
national scandal', it said, and called for half-day nursery education for
all three and four-year-olds by 1999.
The report's author, Sir Christopher Ball, a former warden of Keble College,
Oxford, said: 'We know what to do. The question is how to do it. Children
benefit from the experience of good early learning. But it must not be done
on the cheap, because quality counts.'
Mr Patten said half of three and four-year-olds already received some
nursery education, and if the voluntary and private sectors were included,
this rose to nine out of 10.
Labour also rejected the idea of raising the school starting age from five
to six.

FT  18 MAR 94 / Hunt offers 'partnership' to unions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's trade unions were offered a new partnership with the government
yesterday by Mr David Hunt, employment secretary, but he told them they
would have 'no direct role in the determination of policy'.
Responding to last week's relaunch of the Trades Union Congress he told a
meeting of the Industrial Society that his door was 'always open for
dialogue' with the trade unions.
'But unions must recognise their own limitations,' he said. 'There will be
no preferential status for unions on the inside of government.'
The employment secretary highlighted the development of the government's
proposed new apprenticeship scheme to train about 40,000 young people a year
in technical, craft and supervisory skills as an issue on which trade unions
and government could have a dialogue.
Mr Hunt said it was 'heartening that unions may be shaping up and
modernising'. He urged them to support employers in achieving greater
competitiveness and concentrate on providing more individual services to
their members.
Mr John Monks, TUC general secretary, welcomed employ Mr Hunt's remarks. He
said: 'It was good to hear that he and the government recognise the
potential for a positive trade union role. I do see plenty of scope for
discussion.'
Mr Monks added, however, that he was disappointed that Mr Hunt had not
acknowledged the big contribution trade unions had made to the success of 47
out of the top 50 profitable companies in Britain.

FT  18 MAR 94 / Howard to pay costs after raid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The High Court yesterday ordered Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, to pay
court costs estimated at between Pounds 100,000 and Pounds 150,000 for
unlawfully authorising the police to seek a warrant to raid a leading London
law firm.
The court ordered that documents seized during the raid on the offices of
City solicitors Theodore Goddard and accountants Stein Richards be returned.
Mr Howard had denied that he or the Home Office had acted unlawfully in
responding to a request from the Australian government for mutual assistance
in a criminal investigation.
The court said, however, that he had failed to follow the correct procedures
for handling such a request under the 1990 Criminal Justice (International
Co-operation) Act.
In August last year Mr Howard received a request from the Australian
director of public prosecutions for assistance in obtaining information
wanted in connection with an investigation involving the Sydney-based
company, Scheinberg, owner of the Best &amp; Less retail chain.
After vetting the request Mr Howard passed it to the Metropolitan Police,
giving them a free hand in deciding what procedures to follow.
Following a further request in October, which was passed by the Home Office
to the police without vetting, the police obtained search warrants from an
Old Bailey judge and raided the offices of the two City firms. Both act for
Scheinberg.
The documents seized were then handed by the police directly to the
Australians, in breach of the terms of the 1990 Act which requires the home
secretary to check first that they are the correct documents and are not
privileged.
Theodore Goddard immediately obtained an injunction to stop the Australians
removing the documents from the UK and applied for a judicial review of the
home secretary's original decision to authorise the police to seek the
warrants.
Quashing the judge's decision to issue the search warrants, Mr Justice Laws
said the home secretary had been wrong to give the police a free hand in
deciding how to execute the request for help. The act required him to
provide direction.
He said Mr Howard's decision to allow the police to hand the documents
directly to the Australians without checking them was also unlawful.
The home secretary said last night that he was considering an appeal.

FT  18 MAR 94 / Tec defends payment to director's colliery project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A training and enterprise council yesterday defended a payment of Pounds
300,000 to one of its non-executive directors, whose company is re-opening
Clipstone Colliery, near Mansfield.
Mr Paddy Tipping, MP for Sherwood, said yesterday it had taken him three
months to persuade North Nottinghamshire Tec to disclose the details of the
payment to RJB Mining to recruit and train about 200 local people who had
been unemployed for 12 months or more.
He said: 'This is public money. When I originally asked the Tec for details
of the payment it refused.'
Earlier this month Mr Richard Budge, the new owner of the colliery, became a
director of the Tec - some months after he applied for the training grant.
The payment comes at a time of public concern about the accountability of
non-elected bodies - including Tecs, which administer about Pounds 2bn of
public funds for training in England and Wales.
Mrs Pat Richards, chief executive of North Nottinghamshire Tec, said
yesterday: 'Help of this kind is available to any company seeking to
establish an operation in our area - or companies already here - which
create jobs for local people.'
She said that the Tec had sought to persuade Mr Budge to recruit the
long-term unemployed. Some of the recruits were former miners but the
training would provide multi-skilled teams in a mine which had employed 800.
She said: 'We encourage companies to come to the Tec first when offering new
jobs because we want to help the unemployed. All the individuals at the
colliery are having training, even those who are former miners.'
Mrs Richards said the Tec operated an 'open book policy' for directors - the
public could see when grants were received by companies in which the
non-executive directors had a direct or indirect interest.
She said a number of directors had received grants for in-company training,
including the new Investors In People scheme.
Mrs Richards said: 'We want to encourage our directors' companies to set a
local example.'

FT  18 MAR 94 / Adams sees prime peace role for US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, JUREK MARTIN, TIM COONE and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US could play an instrumental role in helping achieve peace in Northern
Ireland, Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, said in Belfast yesterday.
His remarks, at a St Patrick's Day rally, came as Mr Bill Clinton, US
president, said he had no regrets about letting Mr Adams into the US last
month, in comments which received a cool response from Downing Street.
Meanwhile, Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister on a visit to
Washington, urged political leaders to 'show daring as never before' in
order to make the Anglo-Irish peace initiative work.
Speaking before yesterday's meeting between Mr Reynolds and Mr Clinton, Mr
Adams said that the US administration was displaying readiness to take a
fresh approach to the conflict in spite of sustained British pressure. The
Sinn Fein leader said he detected a willingness among Irish Ameri-cans to
try to move the US administration 'in the direction of directly contributing
to the resolution of the conflict'.
He said republicans wanted to live in peace and without coercion among their
unionist neighbours.
In Washington Mr Clinton called on 'all those who practice violence for
political aims to lay down their arms' and urged 'those who have yet to do
so to endorse the joint declaration as the best, indeed the only, way
forward'.
Mr Clinton responded to Mr Adams's remarks by saying he was 'quite
encouraged' that the IRA remained interested in the peace process. Mr Adam's
words came 'at a good time', and Mr Clinton added: 'I hope it has a good
effect.'
Standing with Mr Reynolds at a White House ceremony to mark St Patrick's
Day, Mr Clinton said it was 'premature' to discuss the question of issuing
another US visa to the Sinn Fein leader. He had no regrets about letting Mr
Adams into the US last month - 'because we all have to take a chance for
peace' - but indicated that much would depend on what Sinn Fein did next.
Downing Street said last night that it disagreed with the decision to let Mr
Adams in at the time but accepted 'they did it with the best of intentions'.
Mr Reynolds said at a dinner hosted by the president that US support for the
Ulster peace process would have 'an important influence on its outcome'. He
sought to spell out the benefits of a peaceful settlement in the province,
saying: 'We have painstakingly erected a framework for the peace process, a
framework in which the joint peace declaration is a crucial element.'

FT  18 MAR 94 / Trail cools in search for Ulster accord: David Owen on the
breakdown in relations between the key players
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Less than a month ago talks co-ordinated by London aimed at forging a
lasting settlement for Northern Ireland were proceeding in a businesslike
and constructive manner.
Today the process is in effect on hold and the corridors of Westminster are
thick with intrigue and recrimination. Whispering campaigns are under way
against the leaders of the two largest political parties in the province.
The speed and degree of the mood change must be disconcerting to those who
confidently assert that the talks will move smoothly after a pause for the
campaign for June's European elections and the 'marching season' which will
follow in July.
The odds are still that these optimists will be right. Some exchanges in
yesterday's Saint Patrick's Day session of Northern Ireland questions in the
Commons were positively playful, suggesting the situation could improve as
rapidly as it has deteriorated.
But the level of spleen vented, principally in private, between the main
protagonists is already such that it may leave scars. Bridges burnt over the
next three months in the interests of campaigning may not be as speedily
repaired as some imagine.
The whispering campaign against Mr James Molyneaux - some government
loyalists are calling into question the Ulster Unionist party leader's
tactics during the London-Dublin peace initiative - appears to stem from a
cooling of his relations with Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland
secretary.
This dates from London's decision last month to send Dublin a checklist of
ideas covering relations in Ulster and between the province and the Irish
government. Senior Ulster Unionists say this broke a pledge by ministers
that they would be shown this document before anyone else.
At the end of last month Mr Molyneaux showed his irritation by attacking Sir
Patrick for 'to some extent torpedoing' the talks process.
Senior Ulster Unionists say Mr Molyneaux subsequently declined to take a
copy of the checklist offered to him by Sir Patrick at a private meeting,
although other senior Ulster Unionists are now understood to be in
possession of the document.
London says Sir Patrick showed Mr Molyneaux the checklist, in common with
the leaders of the other Northern Ireland parties engaged in bilateral
discussions co-ordinated by Mr Michael Ancram, the Northern Ireland
minister. The UUP has said it is willing to continue bilateral talks.
Many observers argue that relations between the UUP and London were bound to
cool given the party's anxiety to protect its flank against the hardline
Democratic Unionist party ahead of the European elections. By this line of
reasoning, UUP leaders were waiting for a pretext to force a rift.
The UUP, for its part, has started to pursue its own whispering campaign -
against Mr John Hume, the Social Democratic and Labour party leader - with
renewed intensity.
They say that he does not represent the views of his party in insisting that
the 'nothing is agreed until everything is agreed' formula governing the
talks must be adhered to come what may.
Their aim is to isolate Mr Hume and bring about a situation in which an
assembly, with safeguards to protect minority rights, could be set up in
Northern Ireland, irrespective of whether agreement was possible on either
north-south relations or relations between London and Dublin.
A Lords debate on the province earlier this month showed that this view is
not confined to Ulster Unionists.
Lord Brookeborough, a Conservative peer, said: 'The SDLP looks not a little
split with John Hume getting too close to Dublin and Sinn Fein for many of
his party members' liking.'
In the same debate Lord Fitt - who left the SDLP in 1979 and now calls
himself an independent socialist - said the 'nothing is agreed . . . '
formula 'can only lead to the defeat of the whole operation'.
Meanwhile, the DUP - sensing a chance to undermine the Downing Street
declaration - has started to call for a united unionist front against the
document.
Mr Peter Robinson, the party's deputy leader, called earlier this week for
all pro-union groups opposed to the joint declaration to form a
co-ordinating unit to advance their case to government.

FT  18 MAR 94 / Lyell says he was not warned by MI6
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS, JOHN MASON and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An embattled Sir Nicholas Lyell yesterday denied that he had been warned by
the intelligence service MI6 (SIS) to call off the prosecution of three
Matrix Churchill executives for breaching arms regulations.
But last night a senior Customs &amp; Excise official confirmed that his
department had told the attorney-general about the intelligence connections
of one of the Matrix Churchill defendants before the prosecution.
'I have no doubt that the attorney-general was aware of the situation,' the
official said. Customs was informed by MI6 that one of the Matrix Churchill
executives, Mr Paul Henderson, had 'given them information selectively'
about Iraq's military procurement activities.
Sir Nicholas's statement followed a report in yesterday's Independent
newspaper about the MI6 allegations.
An official Whitehall source confirmed that MI6 passed information about Mr
Henderson's intelligence work to Customs before its decision to prosecute.
MI6 considered Mr Henderson a 'brave man' and a 'source that provided some
useful information'. The source added: 'It was the role of Customs as the
prosecuting authority, not SIS to warn the attorney-general to call off the
prosecution. They didn't'
The Matrix Churchill trial collapsed after evidence from Mr Alan Clark, the
former trade minister, and documents which the government had tried
unsuccessfully to suppress showed that Matrix Churchill exported
defence-related goods to Iraq with official backing.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, yesterday told the Commons that Sir
Nicholas had his 'full and complete confidence'. Challenged in the Commons,
Mr Major said that Sir Nicholas had received 'no notification' from Lord
Justice Scott's arms-to-Iraq inquiry 'that any such evidence' about MI6
warning Sir Nicholas 'has been given to them'.
The secretary to the Scott inquiry, Mr Christopher Muttukumaru, said
evidence would be 'checked again' - but added that his recollection was that
'no such evidence' was given by MI6 officers.
But neither statement allayed suspicions among opposition MPs that Sir
Nicholas was being set up as the 'fall guy' if the Scott inquiry delivers a
harsh verdict on the government's handling of the affair. Sir Nicholas is
due to give evidence on March 24.
Mr Menzies Campbell, Liberal Democrat defence spokesman, said: 'The steady
drip of adverse publicity against the attorney-general reinforces the
impression that he is being set up as a sacrifice to the Scott inquiry. But
even that will not allow more senior government ministers to evade their
political responsibility for the government's actions in this matter.'
Meanwhile, the Scott inquiry was told yesterday by a senior Customs lawyer
that Customs investigators hit a 'complete wall' when trying to get the most
confidential papers about Matrix Churchill from MI6.
Mrs Annabelle Bolt said some papers were released and others made available
to Customs investigators given special security clearance. However, Customs
was never told of other papers relating to their inquiry, including material
from GCHQ, the government's secret communications centre.

FT  18 MAR 94 / Motor insurers expect sharp fall in rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Many consumers can expect the cost of their motor insurance to fall this
year as competition drives down premium rates, according to two of the
country's biggest chains of insurance shops.
Mr Barry Hulbert, managing director of Hill House Hammond, estimated that
four out of five drivers could expect to pay less, although drivers with
poor records might still face increases.
He said: 'Overall, comprehensive premiums should drop by 5 per cent or
more.'
Figures drawn up by Hill House Hammond show that the average cost of a
comprehensive motor insurance policy has already fallen from Pounds 442.54
to Pounds 417.34 during the past four months, while average rates for
non-comprehensive policies - which cover third party liabilities and some
other risks - have dropped from Pounds 280 to Pounds 273.
Mr Hulbert said: 'It is a very competitive market. It is the customer's
dream.'
Mr Mark Wood, managing director of AA Insurance, said comprehensive rates
could fall by between 5 per cent and 10 per cent this year, while rates for
non-compre-hensive policies could fall by between 2 per cent and 5 per cent.
He added: 'The industry has only recently been prepared to admit that rates
are falling. There is now crystal clear evidence.'
The reductions will be counteracted to some extent in October when the 2.5
per cent insurance tax announced in November's Budget comes into effect.
They follow rate increases of more than 20 per cent a year since 1991, with
insurance companies increasing rates in response to a sharp rise in accident
and theft claims.
Younger drivers or drivers of faster cars have faced even steeper rate
increases.
Most insurance companies are back in profit, however, and there is evidence
that claims have started to decline. In addition several 'direct writers',
selling by a combination of mass marketing and telephone sales rather than
through a broker or intermediary, have entered the market.
Some buyers may benefit from even sharper reductions as the market becomes
more sophisticated in its assessment of risks.
Hill House Hammond is offering lower rates to women drivers and drivers of
cars fitted with high-level rear brake lights, for example.

FT  18 MAR 94 / US has key role to play in peace, says Adams
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, JUREK MARTIN, TIM COONE and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US could play an instrumental role in helping achieve peace in Northern
Ireland, Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, said in Belfast yesterday.
Mr Adams told a St Patrick's Day rally that the US Administration was
displaying readiness to take a fresh approach to the conflict in spite of
sustained British pressure.
Mr Adams was speaking before yesterday's meeting in the US between Mr Albert
Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, and Mr Bill Clinton, the US president.
The Sinn Fein leader said republicans wanted to live in peace and without
coercion among their unionist neighbours. He said Sinn Fein neither condoned
nor encouraged armed actions and stressed that all parties had to be
involved in the current peace process.
Mr Adams's stance received a guarded welcome in Washington, with Mr Clinton
saying he was 'quite encouraged' that the IRA remained interested in the
peace process. Mr Adams's words came 'at a good time', and Mr Clinton added:
'I hope it has a good effect.'
Standing with Mr Reynolds at a White House ceremony to mark St Patrick's
Day, Mr Clinton said it was 'premature' to discuss the question of issuing
another US visa to the Sinn Fein leader. He had no regrets about letting Mr
Adams into the US last month - 'because we all have to take a chance for
peace' - but indicated that much would depend on what Mr Adams's party did
next.
'The issue now is what is going to be the role of Sinn Fein in the ongoing
peace effort,' he explained. 'Will they join? I hope they will.'
Speaking later at a St Patrick's Day dinner hosted by the president, Mr
Reynolds said that US support for the Northern Ireland peace process would
have 'an important influence' on its outcome.' He said that the Downing
Street declaration had created a 'historic opportunity' to resolve the
Northern Ireland conflict and had 'removed any possible justification for
violence'.
He had earlier briefed Mr Clinton on the latest developments in the peace
process and he was in turn briefed by Mr Clinton on the recent visit to the
US by Mr John Major, the prime minister.
In London, Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, was urged
strongly by Tory backbenchers to increase pressure on the Irish government
to improve security co-operation.
Many Conservative backbenchers are anxious for security co-operation to be
improved in areas such as intelligence gathering and the cross-border
pursuit of terrorist suspects. These matters are understood to have been
raised by officers of the Tory backbench Northern Ireland committee in a
short meeting with the Northern Ireland secretary after question-time in the
House of Commons.
Earlier, Sir Patrick told MPs that the recent IRA mortar attacks at Heathrow
Airport would not wreck the peace process.
He said: 'If Sinn Fein or the Provisional IRA consider that they are going
by violence to secure a departure from the declaration or any concession
from the British government, they would be better employed taking a running
jump at themselves.'

FT  18 MAR 94 / Watchdog agrees pensions guidelines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Securities and Invest-ments Board, the City's chief watchdog, has
completed the first stage of its work to allay public concern about the
mis-selling of personal pensions to people transferring out of an
occupational scheme.
The decision came yesterday as Legal &amp; General, the life and general
insurance group, became the latest insurer to announce that it was making
'prudent' provision against the potential need to compensate investors who
had been badly advised to transfer out of an employer's scheme.
Mr David Prosser, group chief executive, refused to give the scale of the
provisions, or say how many pension transfers L&amp;G had carried out, but said
that the overall value of pension transfers received as premiums was about
Pounds 500m.
He said the industry had been 'hit quite hard in the press' over the issue,
and suggested that the position of actuaries and occupational scheme
trustees had been somewhat overlooked so far.
At its meeting yesterday, the SIB board agreed, with only slight changes,
the proposals put forward by the regulators' steering group.
The group was set up in December to ensure higher standards in this area of
business for the future.
The main elements of the plans - which will be published shortly - are the
introduction of a cooling-off period into the pension transfer transaction
and issuing SIB guidance directly to investors about the points they should
raise with sales agents or advisers in considering a pension transfer.
The focus of SIB's work on pension transfers will now shift to compensating
people who have suffered as a result of poor advice.
By the end of next month it will issue guidance to companies about how to
identify priority cases.
This will be followed three months later by an overall plan for dealing with
past business.

FT  18 MAR 94 / Hurd drums up support over Euro-veto row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD and IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, last night addressed senior members of
the powerful backbench 1922 Committee to rally support for an eventual
compromise over Britain's demand that there should be no change to its
blocking veto.
The foreign secretary earlier received the cabinet's backing for a deal
which 'preserved the substance' of the UK position, which seeks to prevent
the number of votes needed to block legislation rising from 23 to 27. But he
was warned by Euro-sceptics that they would not vote for any deal which
'further diluted the Common's authority'.
Both Mr Hurd and the prime minister, however, have made it clear that the
dispute should not lead to a delay in enlargement of the community.
At prime minister's questions Mr John Major rebuked Mr Roger Knapman, a
Conservative Euro-sceptic, for trying to get the government to rule out any
compromise. 'I have no intention of being moved by synthetic efforts to
pressure us from any source,' he said.
He insisted that Mr Hurd was negotiating to safeguard Britain's short and
long-term interests, and added: 'I am entirely confident that can be done in
an acceptable way without any question of delaying enlargement.'
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said Mr Hurd had the
full support of his cabinet colleagues for negotiations with EU foreign
ministers on Tuesday.
He told a press conference on deregulation that he had always described
himself as a European because Britain's membership of the EU was 'a policy
extension of Britain's self-interest'. It did the UK no harm if there were
rows with Britain's partners, he said.
The government plans to bring forward legislation to the Commons in the
autumn if there is agreement on enlargement. But a number of Conservative
rightwingers and Euro-sceptics are threatening to rebel if the government
compromises over weakening its blocking veto.
Some unsuccessfully demanded that any deal by Mr Hurd should first be
discussed in the Commons.
Top business executives with experience of multinational companies should be
appointed to a special task force to tackle large-scale fraud in the
European Union, a House of Lords committee recommends today, Ivor Owen
writes.
Lord Hunt of Tamworth, chairman of the Lords committee on the European
communities, refers to a report by the Court of Auditors on the 1992 EU
budget which showed Ecu162m had been misapplied or not received. He says a
similar condemnation of international industrial or trading groups in the UK
would result in shareholders sacking the directors and appointing a new
board.
The committee calls for the task force to be established as part of urgent
remedial action co-ordinated by the council of ministers, the European
Commission and member states.

FT  18 MAR 94 / New cancer drug shows promise in first tests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first tests on patients of a new form of cancer treatment developed by a
British company have shown promising results, data published yesterday show.
British Biotechnology's drug batimastat performed well enough with 15
patients in the trial for investigators to give additional doses to some
patients.
Professor John Smyth of the Imperial Cancer Research Fund's Medical Oncology
Unit at Edinburgh's Western General Hospital said he was 'very encouraged'
by the results of the trial, which suggested the drug 'may be effective in
the treatment of ovarian cancer'. It had not shown significant side effects.
Batimastat works by acting against enzymes that destroy tissue surrounding
cancer cells.
If the drug does well in the next two years of clinical trials it could be
used in the treatment of a variety of cancers, including breast, lung,
colorectal and prostate, even on patients close to death. Mr James Noble,
finance director of British Biotechnology, said 650,000 people died of such
late-stage cancers each year in Europe and the US.
The second phase of clinical trials starts next month and the third phase,
which is needed for applications for approval by the world's health
regulatory bodies, should begin later this year. Cancer drugs often receive
priority treatment from regulatory bodies because so many patients do not
respond well enough to existing treatments.
Batimastat works by acting against enzymes that destroy tissue surrounding
cancer cells. By breaking down the tissues, the cancer can grow and spread.
British Biotechnology shares rose 5p to 450p yesterday.

FT  18 MAR 94 / 600 more jobs to go in retail shakeout
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WH Smith, the UK retail and distribution group, expects to shed up to 600
staff as part of a restructuring plan in its stores that will cut the number
of management layers from four to two.
In a further example of the shift towards part-time working in the retail
sector, WH Smith will take on an extra 400 part-time sales staff under the
plan. The company said it hoped that the majority of the redundancies would
be voluntary.
The announcement is the latest in a series of job losses in the retail
sector, including 800 at Tesco, the UK's second-biggest grocery chain, and
650 at J. Sainsbury, Britain's biggest grocer.
WH Smith is halving the number of store management staff - cutting 954 jobs
 -by abolishing the positions of deputy, assistant and departmental manager
throughout its 500 stores.
They will be replaced by new customer service/support managers as the second
tier of management, and 600 non-management customer service leaders who will
be responsible for leading teams of sales assistants.
The company said that it hoped to redeploy and relocate many of the managers
involved, but it estimated that up to 600 were likely to take redundancy.
The group said: 'The structure of the business has not really changed for 10
years, although we have introduced many new systems in that time.
'A lot of job titles did not reflect the reality of life now. The really
urgent need was to get more pairs of hands onto the sales floor.'
WH Smith said it had consulted extensively with its staff on changes during
the past year, and the new structure aimed both to improve customer service
and to increase productivity.
Annual savings once the new structure is in place are estimated at Pounds
2.4m.
WH Smith will make a Pounds 6m provision to cover redundancy costs in its
1993-94 annual accounts.
The supermarket group Sainsbury, in addition to the 650 job losses announced
in its head and area offices last Friday, has a similar pilot programme
involving stripping out layers of management in 25 stores.

FT  18 MAR 94 / Artificial bone set to transform hip surgery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Scientists have made and tested a replacement bone material which knits
cleanly with real bone. The material, which can last a lifetime, could
transform life for the 500,000 people worldwide who undergo hip replacements
each year.
The 'bio-ceramic' has already been used successfully to repair the
cheekbones of 30 patients. This year a clinical trial will start with 400
people.
But according to Professor William Bonfield, head of the research team that
produced the artificial bone at Queen Mary and Westfield College, London,
the most important application will be in hip replacements.
Current metal and ceramic implants have to be replaced surgically every five
to 15 years. They fail when bone shrinks away from the implant and the joint
works loose.
In the UK each of the 40,000 operations a year costs Pounds 6,000, and the
potential annual savings from the new material is estimated at Pounds 80m.
Prof Bonfield told a conference in London yesterday that his team expected
to start trials within two years on people whose first artificial hips have
failed.
The new material is a composite containing hydroxy-apatite, the main mineral
in bone, blended with polyethylene plastic. Others have formulated
artificial bone from hydroxy-apatite but what makes the London material a
world first, according to Prof Bonfield, is that it has the same
micro-crystalline structure as real bone. That enables the patient's bone to
grow cleanly into the implant.
The secret - which Prof Bonfield is negotiating to commercialise - lies in
the way crystals nanometres (millionths of a millimetre) long are preserved
while making the hydroxy-apatite into a ceramic.
Other participants at the Hammersmith Hospital conference on 'nanotechnology
in medicine' responded enthusiastically to the innovation.
Prof Colin Humphreys, a materials scientist at Cambridge University, said
researchers realised they had 'to work with nature on a nano-scale' if they
were to make materials truly compatible with the human body. He forecast
that nanotechnology would lead to implanting silicon chips in the brain 'as
an aid to memory or treatment for Alzheimer's disease'.

FT  18 MAR 94 / Cabinet deadlocked on Tube deal: Ministers warn Major to
back financing plan or risk rout in London elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major has been warned by ministerial colleagues to overrule Treasury
objections to a new London Underground financing scheme or face the threat
of a Tory rout in the London local elections in May.
The cabinet is deadlocked over a Pounds 440m leasing deal to provide new
trains for London's Northern Line. The scheme is being pressed by Mr John
MacGregor, transport secretary, and Mr John Gummer, environment secretary.
But the proposal - essentially a 20-year leasing arrangement - being
promoted by ABB Transportation, a rolling stock manufacturer, has run into
fierce Treasury opposition.
Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary to the Treasury, insists it would
represent a flagrant breach of public borrowing rules.
Ministers believe the deadlock will be broken only if Mr Major intervenes.
The prime minister has recently taken a tougher line in settling Whitehall
disputes and showed his willingness to overrule the Treasury when the
government last month approved London Regional Transport's CrossRail scheme.
The ministers are warning that the issue has already assumed a high
political profile because of the frequent disruption of Northern Line
services caused by the breakdown of 30-year-old trains.
The government is already bracing itself for heavy losses in outer London
boroughs in the local elections.
Ministers believe that the losses could turn into a collapse if the
government is seen to reject the modernisation plan. The scheme has won
support from a number of London-based Conservative MPs and the present
deadlock has become a powerful weapon in the Labour party's campaign. It has
secured approval from the government's own private finance panel.
Mr John Marshall, Tory MP for Hendon, yesterday used a Commons debate to
step up pressure on Mr Portillo. He said the ABB offer meant new trains
could be running on the Northern Line by Christmas.
'The Northern Line needs to be modernised and needs to be modernised
quickly,' he said. 'Any businessman would back the scheme which ABB has come
forward with.'
The government's embarrassment has been increased by the fact that Mr
Portillo has been appointed as the party's campaigns co-ordinator for the
London poll.
But the Treasury view is that the ABB proposal falls well outside its
commitment to promote private finance for important infrastructure schemes.

FT  18 MAR 94 / Ucatt attacks 'debts' rumour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ucatt, the construction union, yesterday said that groups of trade unionists
were in collusion with employers in a 'rumour campaign' which falsely
alleged that it was about to go into liquidation, Robert Taylor writes.
Mr George Brumwell, general secretary, said: 'Our union has been subject to
vicious lies alleging either that we have gone bust or are in imminent
danger of doing so. Nothing could be further from the truth.' He did not
give details of which union or unions the individuals involved came from.
Ucatt merger talks with the TGWU general union have reached a delicate
stage. A conflict over alleged membership poaching in construction is still
going on with the AEEU engineering union.
Mr Brumwell said the 'only real financial liability' was a Pounds 1.4m
overdraft facility with Unity Trust, the union bank, which was more than
adequately covered by assets.

FT  18 MAR 94 / Malaysia urged to reverse trade bias
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ and ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said yesterday he hoped
Malaysia would reverse its recent discrimination against trade with British
companies, in spite of fresh indications that it was hardening its stance.
Mr Heseltine said he hoped both countries would restore good trading
relations 'at the earliest opportunity'.
His comments came as Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the Malaysian prime minister,
appeared to take a hard line towards trade relations after allegations that
a British offer of aid to help Malaysia build the Pergau dam was linked to
sales of defence equipment.
In a letter to the Financial Times, published yesterday, Dr Mahathir
attacked British press reporting on the Pergau dam issue, saying there would
be no contracts for British companies as long as 'lies' were written in the
British press about the issue.
Meanwhile, Mr Andrew Lees, campaigns director of Friends of Earth, told the
Commons foreign affairs committee yesterday that Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign
secretary, could have broken the Overseas Development Administration's rules
on aid and trade provision when he gave final approval for funds to be sent
to Malaysia in July 1991.
Mr Lees said: 'The payment in the Pergau case was not within the published
rules and procedures.' Mr Hurd could only have abided by the regulations if
he had secured Treasury permission to go ahead.

FT  18 MAR 94 / Lords call for task force to fight EU fraud
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Top business executives with experience of multinational companies should be
appointed to a special task force to tackle large-scale fraud in the
European Union, a House of Lords committee recommends today.
Lord Hunt of Tamworth, chairman of the Lords committee on the European
communities, highlights the latest evidence of 'continuing fraud and
irregularity on a massive scale'.
Commenting on the report by the Court of Auditors on the 1992 community
budget - which showed Ecu162m had been misapplied or not received - he says
a similar condemnation of international industrial or trading groups in the
UK would result in shareholders sacking the directors and appointing a new
board.
The committee calls for the task force to be established as part of urgent
remedial action co-ordinated by the council of ministers, the European
Commission and member states.
It suggests that the task force comprise four to six people with wide
experience in the administration of large concerns and with up-to-date
knowledge of modern accounting and auditing techniques.
The committee believes some of the members should be drawn from
international groups such as Shell, BP, Unilever and Phillips. Their remit
should include a 'radical look' at the whole system of administering EU
funds, with a view to recommending specific changes.
Changes in the administrative arrangements made by the individual member
states for carrying out EU policy are advocated by the committee, which
notes that 'many of them do it badly'. It urges action to ensure that the
focal point in each member state to which community funds are channelled is
accountable for their proper use.
This should apply whether the funds are disbursed directly or through
intermediary organisations.
In evidence to the committee, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, looked for
more effective action from recent changes in the European Commission,
involving the commissioner, Mr Peter Schmidhuber, being given specific
responsibility for the anti-fraud unit.
The chancellor expected proposals to be produced by the end of March for
strengthening the ability of the commission and the member states to take
action.
He also referred to proposals by Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary,
which would require member states to ensure that serious fraud against the
EU's financial interests ranked as a serious and extraditable offence.

Evening Standard, the capital's principal evening newspaper.
But the Treasury view is that the ABB proposal falls well outside its
commitment to promote private finance for major infrastructure schemes.
Mr Portillo has argued that the manufacturer would bear none of the risk of
the project in return for its guaranteed profits.

FT  18 MAR 94 / Hurd rallies support over Euro-veto row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, last night addressed senior members of
the powerful backbench 1922 Committee to rally support for an eventual
compromise over Britain's demand that there should be no change to its
blocking veto.
The foreign secretary earlier received the cabinet's backing for a deal
which 'preserved the substance' of the UK position, which seeks to prevent
the number of votes needed to block legislation rising from 23 to 27.
But he was warned by Euro-sceptics that they would not vote for any deal
which 'further diluted the Common's authority'.
Both Mr Hurd and the prime minister, however, have made it clear that the
dispute should not lead to a delay in enlargement of the community.
At prime minister's questions Mr John Major rebuked Mr Roger Knapman, a
Conservative Euro-sceptic, for trying to get the government to rule out any
compromise. 'I have no intention of being moved by synthetic efforts to
pressure us from any source,' he said.
He insisted that Mr Hurd was negotiating to safeguard Britain's short and
long-term interests, and added: 'I am entirely confident that can be done in
an acceptable way without any question of delaying enlargement.'
Without a compromise by Britain and Spain, which have been opposing the
proposal to increase the number of votes required to block decisions,
Sweden, Finland, Austria and Norway will be unable to join the EU by next
January.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said Mr Hurd had the
full support of his cabinet colleagues for negotiations with EU foreign
ministers on Tuesday.
Mr Heseltine said at a press conference on deregulation that he had always
described himself as a European because Britain's membership of the EU was
'a policy extension of Britain's self-interest'. It did the UK no harm if
there were rows with Britain's partners, he said.
The government plans to bring forward legislation to the Commons in the
autumn if there is agreement on enlargement.
But a number of Conservative rightwingers and Euro-sceptics are threatening
to rebel if the government compromises over weakening its blocking veto.
Some Tory Euro-sceptics unsuccessfully demanded that any deal agreed by Mr
Hurd should first be discussed in the Commons.
One Euro-sceptic said: 'We shall continue to back Mr Hurd until he gives
in.'
The pro-European wing of the party is lobbying the foreign secretary to
compromise on the issue to secure enlargement.
At present the blocking minority is 23 votes out of the total of 76,
distributed between the 12 members.
After enlargement it is proposed that the blocking minority would increase
to 27 votes out of a new total of 90.

FT  18 MAR 94 / World Trade News: US technology bill clears hurdle -
House-Senate conference to find compromise after Republican filibuster
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Controversial US legislation to speed the development of new manufacturing
technologies and an 'information superhighway' looked set yesterday to be
sent to a House-Senate conference for a compromise to be thrashed out.
A week-long Republican filibuster in the Senate forced Democrats to slash
funding for the measure from Dollars 2.8bn to Dollars 1.9bn (Pounds 1.3bn).
The House passed similar legislation last year; the differences between the
two versions are expected to be resolved and a final bill passed by both
houses before the end of this year.
Democratic Senator Ernest Hollings, chairman of the Senate commerce
committee, said the legislation would help US companies face competition in
technology. 'It allows the government, our universities and our industries
to work together in a partnership to support research for small and
medium-sized manufacturers and technology firms,' he said.
The legislation expands a smaller initiative approved during the Bush
administration. It would also:
raise from seven to 14 the number of manufacturing technology centres where
government and universities provide advice to businesses, and add a number
of small centres.
provide Dollars 451m for the advanced technology programme, a scheme which
provides research grants to businesses developing technologies of broad
economic value.
upgrade the government's high-performance computing and networking programme
for the creation of a national information infrastructure.
direct government agencies to work with computer companies and users to
research advanced applications for education, healthcare, manufacturing and
information.
authorise a pilot programme to stimulate investment in technology companies.
Although US business groups have long sought government financing for
generic technologies, many Republicans oppose such measures on the grounds
that they constitute an 'industrial policy' giving the power 'to pick
winners and losers'.
The leading opponent, Senator John Danforth, a Missouri Republican, used the
filibuster to demand that the Clinton administration reopen negotiations in
the Uruguay Round on a subsidies agreement pact which legitimised but also
limited R&amp;D aid. He is proposing instead of subsidies a permanent R&amp;D tax
credit.
Congressional Democrats said privately that Republicans were trying to deny
a victory to President Bill Clinton, who strongly supports such technology
development programmes.
'They didn't want the money to get to the Commerce Department for use as a
slush fund to buy the 1996 election,' said one Democrat. Particularly they
do not want it to go to the energetic Mr Ron Brown, the commerce secretary
and former chairman of the Democratic party, who is gaining many adherents
in business.
While the legislation increases government aid to industry, it is still less
than 2 per cent of the Dollars 70bn the US spends on R&amp;D. About Dollars 40bn
of that goes to the military.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Japanese government has finalised proposals to ease restrictions on the
freedom of foreign lawyers to do business in Japan.
Under plans prepared by the Justice Ministry, and due to take effect within
a year, foreign and Japanese law firms would be allowed to merge and to
practise foreign and Japanese law from the same office. At present, clients
have to go to separate legal offices for advice on foreign and national law.
However, Japanese lawyers have managed to persuade the government to let
them keep up some protectionism, in the form of a continued ban on foreign
lawyers arguing Japanese cases in Japanese courts.
The proposals are expected to be laid before parliament early next month and
should come into force early in 1995.
They are the result of longstanding pressure from the European Union and the
US, keen to have access to Japan's lucrative but tightly controlled legal
market.
The Japan Federation of Bar Associations has been understandably very
reluctant to expose itself to competition from foreign firms.
However, it finally decided to compromise with the Justice Ministry after Mr
Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, seized on the proposals as part of
his drive for more deregulation in the country's protectionist economy.

A US-Russian joint venture to launch satellites using Russian Proton rockets
has secured over Dollars 600m (Pounds 411m) in contracts, including an
agreement to launch up to five satellites for a European television
broadcaster, officials of Lockheed-Khrunichev-Energia International
announced.
The latest contracts make LKEI a serious contender in the Dollars 1.6bn
world commercial satellite launch market.
Mr Charles Lloyd, LKEI president and chief executive, said: 'This is an
extremely important contract for us, because we beat the French in a deal
with a European customer.' Ariane, the France-based European consortium that
controls about 60 per cent of the world's satellite launch business, also
bid for the contract, Mr Lloyd said.
LKEI will launch up to five satellites for Societe Europeene des Satellites
(SES), a Luxembourg-based company that is building a satellite broadcast
network called DirectTV.
The contract is in addition to an earlier agreement to launch up to five
satellites for Space Systems/Loral, of California. The first launch is set
for early next year. Before the formation of LKEI last year, the Russian
partners reached an agreement to launch communications satellites for
Motorola.
The post-cold war venture initially raised concern in Washington that
low-cost Russian launch services could undermine the US commercial satellite
launch industry.
'LKEI has continued to work hand-in-hand with the US government to ensure
fair competition among launch services providers,' Mr Lloyd said. Under a
US-Russian trade agreement signed last year, Russian launch bids cannot
undercut the lowest western bid by more than 7.5 per cent. The agreement
also limits Russian launches of western satellites to eight a year.
'The LKEI venture is extremely important to us,' said Mr Anatoly Kiselev,
president of the Khrunichev Space Center and co-chairman of LKEI. 'We see
this effort as critical to the Russian aerospace industry.'
Mr Lloyd said LKEI was identifying work needed to improve the Baikonur
launch facilities in Kazakhstan, and has begun talks with insurance
underwriters.

up
</HEADLINE>

   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Trade negotiators in Geneva yesterday reached broad agreement on two
important procedural decisions to be taken by ministers next month in
Marrakesh when they meet to sign the Uruguay Round trade liberalisation
accords.
The first aims to speed up negotiations with countries which, for one reason
or another, will not automatically qualify for membership of the World Trade
Organisation, the powerful new world trade body that will supersede the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade next year.
The draft decision would allow negotiations on WTO membership to start
immediately after the Marrakesh meeting, without waiting for the
organisation to be established.
Countries affected fall into four categories: China and Algeria, which
participated fully in the Round but are still negotiating Gatt membership;
some less-developed nations which have not yet submitted tariff and services
schedules; some Gatt members which joined too late to take a full part in
the Round; and countries joining Gatt after the Marrakesh signings but
before the WTO comes into force, probably next January.
The second draft decision establishes a WTO preparatory committee with
widely drawn terms of reference to bridge the transition between the
Marrakesh meeting and the WTO's entry into force.
The committee, open to all countries eligible to be WTO founder members,
would handle administrative, financial and procedural matters relating to
the future WTO, including accessions.
It would also draft terms of reference for WTO subsidiary bodies and launch
the work programme already agreed in the Uruguay Round, for instance on some
aspects of trade in services, and the links between trade and the
environment.
Still to be decided, and highly controversial, is whether the preparatory
committee is able to discuss other suggestions for future work by the WTO.
The US and some European countries want worker rights to go on the WTO
agenda.
However, this is being vigorously opposed by many developing nations.

FT  18 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Brussels forced to revise silk quota
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL JOHNSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission has demonstrated its misjudgement of the scale of
European textiles trade with China by changing its quota system governing
silk imports only days after it came into force.
On Monday a new European Union-wide quota of 20,000 tonnes for Chinese silk,
linen and rami was imposed, provoking an immediate uproar from importers who
regarded the quota as way below their expectations.
The Commission arrived at the 20,000-tonne figure by taking the 1992 trade
level of 12,000 tonnes and adding 8,000 tonnes to accommodate growth in the
product and newcomers to the market.
The quota was originally to be allocated on a first-come-first-served basis.
But following a meeting this week, past performance will also be taken into
account. The first 12,000 tonnes will be granted to companies that were
trading in 1992; they will be given a share identical to their 1992 level of
imports.
The remaining 8,000 tonnes will be shared between companies that have
already paid for goods not covered by quota and newcomers.
The UK Department of Trade and Industry's import licensing division
yesterday began contacting all silk importing companies on its books
requiring them to file by 5pm tomorrow returns certifying flows of imported
textiles from China.

TMI Europe, second-largest UK importer of Chinese silk after Tie Rack, said
that it had doubled its turnover since 1992 and could fill the entire quota
on its own.

FT  18 MAR 94 / Brazil will tackle debt restructuring without IMF
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAO PAULO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Brazil told leading bank creditors yesterday it intends to try to complete
its Dollars 52bn commercial debt restructuring by an April 15 deadline
rather than wait for formal support from the International Monetary Fund,
which is not expected until later this year.
Mr Paulo Tarso Flecha de Lima, Brazil's ambassador in Washington, confirmed
his country was seeking to complete the deal without the IMF. 'It will be
difficult but not impossible. We're confident,' he said.
The initiative follows the IMF's refusal on Wednesday to grant Brazil a
standby loan until its planned anti-inflation reforms are in place. If the
country's bank creditors agree to go ahead, Brazil would be the first large
country to launch a Brady-type debt restructuring without the backing of an
IMF standby loan.
Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, finance minister, held talks yesterday with Mr
William Rhodes, vice chairman of Citibank, closing agents for the deal, to
discuss going ahead without the IMF.
Brazil is running out of time and must give notification by tonight that the
April 15 deadline will be met and old debt swapped for new. This deadline
has already been extended and bankers said it could be stretched further.
Before Brazil can give notification, the banks need to agree a waiver of the
restructuring's original requirement for IMF backing. Leading banks met
yesterday to discuss a waiver, which was described as 'do-able' by one
banker. Mr Rhodes said a decision on the waiver would be ready this
afternoon.
Brazil also needs to find an acceptable guarantee for the deal. Originally
the US Treasury was set to issue up to Dollars 21.5bn of zero coupon bonds
as part of a guarantee once the IMF standby was secured. It is unclear if
enough bonds are available. Going ahead with the restructuring without the
IMF would make the deal more expensive and risky. It also would deprive Mr
Cardoso, a potential presidential candidate, of the kudos of IMF backing.
Mr Cardoso had hoped to persuade the IMF to agree a letter of intent for the
stand-by loan during meetings on Wednesday. Although the IMF was supportive,
it did not commit itself to granting the stand-by. It is thought to have
insisted Brazil ran a budget surplus this year but Brazil was only prepared
to offer a balanced budget.
The IMF has also grown wary of Brazil, which has signed but failed to
deliver on eight letters of intent and two stand-by agreements in the last
12 years. Brazil's decision to go ahead without the IMF maybe seen as a
snub, but the country is in an unusual position. It has foreign reserves of
more than Dollars 30bn and IMF support would have been largely symbolic.
Success for Mr Cardoso's domestic reforms, mainly designed to tackle annual
inflation of about 2,500 per cent, is seen as more important for his
presidential ambitions. But Mr Cardoso also wanted the IMF letter and a
smooth conclusion to the bank deal. According to finance ministry officials,
he will now use the IMF's supportive comments as 'the best possible
endorsement' given that the economic reform programme is still unproven.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
One of the US's longest-running and most notorious environmental clean-up
cases passed a milestone yesterday as a judge threw out a Dollars 250m
(Pounds 171.2m) suit for punitive damages against Los Angeles-based
Occidental Petroleum.
The case, brought by New York state over contamination at the Love Canal
site in Niagara, marked the first attempt by a US state to win punitive
damages in a clean-up case. If successful, it could have prompted other US
states to take a more aggressive approach in such cases.
Occidental has already been found liable for clean-up costs of Dollars 325m
at the site.
The Love Canal case dates back to the 1940s, when Hooker Chemical, later
acquired by Occidental, dumped chemical waste in a disused canal on a site
it owned near Niagara. The site was sold in 1953 to a local authority, which
built a school on it. Chemical contamination began to affect the school and
surrounding housing in the 1970s, leading eventually to the displacement of
2,500 local residents.
A judge ruled yesterday that the prosecution had failed to prove Hooker had
shown 'reckless disregard for the safety of others', although the company
'should have made greater efforts to keep local residents off the property'.

FT  18 MAR 94 / Michigan raises sales tax to pay for schools: Vote sets a
precedent as 28 states seek new ways to finance education
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The voters of Michigan this week set a precedent with revolutionary
implications for state finances and education. They easily approved a ballot
motion sharply increasing the local sales tax as a means of paying for the
state's schools budget, traditionally underwritten by property taxes.
The Michigan measure, promoted by Mr John Engler, the Republican governor,
would generate an additional Dollars 2.1bn (Pounds 1.43bn) in revenues by
raising to 6 per cent from 4 per cent the state sales tax and by tripling
the local tax on cigarettes to 75 cents a pack. This sum, specifically
earmarked for education, more than covers a planned Dollars 1.9bn cut in
property taxes.
It would permit the state to increase by about 6 per cent to Dollars 10.2bn
the Michigan education budget, under such severe strain recently that one
school district last year closed 10 weeks early because its resources had
been exhausted.
Under the governor's plan, the state will also try to equalise the large gap
in spending between rich and poor school districts by providing each
district with a guaranteed minimum sum per student and by limiting spending
increases by the wealthier districts.
This discrepancy, less severe in Michigan than in most other states, is
widely seen as one of the most inequitable factors in American education
because it perpetuates the disadvantages of society's underclasses.
The increase in the sales tax is not considered an ideal solution, since
revenues may vary according to the health of the economy.
But it was reckoned preferable to a further squeeze on property taxpayers,
in widespread revolt over the last 15 years since the passage of the
tax-cutting Proposition 13 in California, or to the politically explosive
alternative of higher state income taxes.
Tax-cutting at state level has come back into vogue across the country,
especially now that the economic recovery has removed some of the
constraints on state budgets. Mrs Christine Todd Whitman, the new governor
of New Jersey, has just secured approval for a 5 per cent cut in income
taxes, the first instalment, she promises, on a multi-year 30 per cent tax
reduction.
Even in California, still in a recession, Governor Pete Wilson, up for
re-election this year like Governor Engler, has found fiscal room to propose
a modest Dollars 135m tax cut, mostly directed at the lower end of the
income scale.
All told, according to yesterday's New York Times, 28 states are in various
stages of public and legal debate about new ways to finance education and
nearly 20 have active tax-shifting proposals under consideration, mostly
designed to relieve property taxpayers.
According to one independent study, the recession forced the states to
increase local taxes by a net Dollars 9.2bn in 1990 and Dollars 14.4bn in
1991 to maintain essential services. The respective increases for the last
two years were Dollars 1.4bn and Dollars 1.1bn. This year could see net cuts
of around Dollars 3bn.
The Clinton administration will not be displeased by the 70 per cent margin
by which Michigan voters approved higher taxes on cigarettes. Its proposal
for an even steeper increase in the federal excise tax on tobacco products,
part of its healthcare reform plans, is being vigorously fought by the
industry. Several states, most recently New York and Maryland, have approved
swingeing measures restricting smoking in public buildings.

FT  18 MAR 94 / Brazil may complete debt restructuring without IMF
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAO PAULO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Brazil is actively studying whether to complete its Dollars 52bn (Pounds
35.60bn) commercial debt restructuring without the formal blessing of the
International Monetary Fund.
Going ahead without IMF approval of a standby loan would make the
restructuring more expensive and also deprive Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso,
finance minister and potential presidential candidate, of the kudos of IMF
backing.
But Mr Cardoso, who was yesterday due to meet Citibank, the restructuring's
closing agent, in New York, is being urged to finalise the deal rather than
risk another extension beyond the April 15 deadline. Bankers fear it may be
hard to approve another extension and that the deal would be delayed by
October's elections.
According to the deal's timetable, Brazil must give notification by tonight
that the April 15 deadline will be met and old debt swapped for new. This
deadline has already been extended and bankers say it cannot be stretched
further.
Mr Cardoso had hoped to persuade the IMF to agree a letter of intent for the
standby loan during meetings on Wednesday. Such a letter would have
kick-started the whole deal, and allowed the US Treasury to issue
zero-coupon bonds as part of the guarantee for the restructuring.
Brazil is the developing world's largest debtor, and the the only one of
Latin America's big four debtor countries - the others being Mexico,
Venezuela and Argentina - not to have completed a Brady-style foreign bank
debt deal.
Although the IMF was supportive of Mr Cardoso, it did not commit itself to
granting the stand-by. It is thought to have insisted that Brazil run a
budget surplus this year, but Brazil was only prepared to offer a balanced
budget. The IMF has also grown wary of Brazil, which has signed but failed
to deliver on eight letters of intent and two standby agreements in 12
years.
For the deal to go ahead, the banks need to agree a waiver of the
restructuring's original requirement for IMF backing. Leading banks met
yesterday morning to discuss a waiver, which one banker described as
'do-able'.
Brazil also needs to provide an acceptable guarantee in place of the US
Treasury's issuance of zero coupon bonds. According to some reports, it has
been accumulating bonds through market purchases, although whether enough
bonds are available in the market is unclear.
Mr Cardoso had planned to spend a quiet weekend in New York with his wife
and decide whether to resign and run for president. Instead, he finds
himself up against an extremely tight deadline on the bank deal. Under
Brazilian law he has to resign by April 2 to contest the presidency.
Success for his domestic reforms, mainly designed to tackle annual inflation
of about 2,500 per cent, is seen as more important for his presidential
ambitions. But Mr Cardoso, a former academic who is well known in
Washington, also wanted the IMF letter and a smooth conclusion to the bank
deal. According to finance ministry officials, he will now use the IMF's
positive comments as 'the best possible endorsement' given that the economic
reform programme is still unproved.

FT  18 MAR 94 / 'The meeting is the message' at Apec forum: George Graham on
the meeting in Hawaii of 17 Asia-Pacific countries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the last two months, the US has backed itself into a series of conflicts
with almost half its fellow members in the Asia Pacific Economic
Co-operation forum.
Besides its long-running battle to open Japan's markets, President Bill
Clinton's administration has feuded with Indonesia on human rights, with
Thailand on access to financial services markets and with Singapore on the
island state's decision to cane a US teenager for vandalism.
Most ominous of all, after the failure of a mission last week to Beijing by
Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, is an impending clash with
China over the human rights improvements Mr Clinton is demanding as a
condition for renewing China's most favoured nation trade privileges.
Little of that, however, will surface this evening and tomorrow when finance
ministers from the 17 Apec countries meet on the Hawaiian island of O'ahu.
'The meeting is the message,' said finance ministry officials from three
different Apec countries, in unison.
Even US Treasury secretary Lloyd Bentsen's expected bilateral meetings with
his Japanese and Chinese counterparts are unlikely to touch on the trade
sores between them.
The meeting is the first to take place between Apec finance ministers, and
marks another step forward, after a ground-breaking leaders' summit in
Seattle last November, for the fledgling organisation.
Some member countries hold out great hopes of an Apec evolving gradually
from 'four adjectives in search of a noun', as an Australian minister
described it, into the 'new Pacific community' enunciated by Mr Clinton.
Even the most enthusiastic Apec supporters, however, acknowledge that
progress towards such a goal, not shared by all, will be slow.
Apec offers considerable advantages as a forum bringing together nations
from both sides of the Pacific. It is, for example, one of the rare places
in which the US and China get away from their usual human rights/MFN
dialogue. Even more unusual, it includes not only China but Hong Kong and
Taiwan.
But its members have wide differences of culture, economic development and
democratisation, and some members, notably Malaysia, remain suspicious that
the US's enthusiasm for Apec may disguise a spoiling operation designed to
undercut the six-member Association of South-east Asian Nations and
Malaysia's idea for an East Asian Economic Caucus, excluding Apec members
such as the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.
Malaysia, whose prime minister, Dr Mahathir Mohamad, boycotted the Seattle
meeting, will participate in full at the finance ministers' meeting, with a
delegation led by Mr Anwar Ibrahim, the deputy prime minister and finance
minister. Dr Mahathir is also expected to attend the second Apec leaders'
summit in Jakarta this autumn.
The meeting in Hawaii this weekend is expected to run through the economic
prospects for the region, which continues to show the most dynamic growth in
the world, but to stop well short of the sort of economic policy
co-ordination attempted by the Group of Seven leading industrial nations.
Finance ministers will examine topics such as ways of facilitating external
financial flows for infrastructure needs and developing capital markets in
the region.
Besides the US, Apec includes Australia, Brunei, Canada, China, Hong Kong,
Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New
Guinea, the Philippines, Taiwan and Thailand. Chile is to be admitted at the
meeting in Jakarta.

Faisal Islamic Bank and Dr Adil Elias, a member of the BCCI creditors'
committee, have lodged an application with the court of referees in
Luxembourg to prevent the liquidators signing an agreement until after April
1. The aim is to ensure Abu Dhabi hands over all records it holds relating
to BCCI. Under a separate agreement between Abu Dhabi and the US, these must
be provided to the liquidators if an agreement has not been finalised by the
start of next month. A hearing is scheduled for Monday.

Moody's Investors Service has upgraded New Zealand's foreign currency debt
rating to AA2 from AA3, Reuter reports from New York. About USDollars 7.8bn
(Pounds 5.2bn) of long-term debt is affected.
Not only had New Zealand's foreign currency debt/exports ratio been
declining rapidly, but this ratio was expected to continue falling over the
next several years, Moody's said. It also expected New Zealand's current
account and government budget deficit to move into surplus.
It seemed almost certain that important political realignments would occur
within New Zealand as a result of the adoption of a 'mixed member
proportional' electoral system (MMP), but these should continue to reflect
the underlying support for the overall reform process.
New Zealand should hold a referendum on abandoning the British crown as head
of state, Prime Minister Jim Bolger said in Blenheim yesterday, AP reports.
He wants the country to become a republic by the year 2000.

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Russia has increased the pressure on Kazakhstan and its western partners to
give Moscow a stake in two of the largest energy projects in the former
Soviet Union.
The Russian targets are the Tengiz oil field being developed by Chevron of
the US and the Dollars 6bn (Pounds 4.1bn) Karachaganak gas development being
negotiated by British Gas and Agip of Italy.
'The Russians want an equity share (of the Chevron project) and they're
going to squeeze till they get it,' said a western diplomat in Alma Ata, the
Kazakh capital.
Moscow argues it has 'an inherent proprietary interest' in natural resources
discovered during the Soviet period, says Mr Ben Miller, director of the
consultancy firm Ernst &amp; Young in Alma Ata. This applies to Tengiz, where
Chevron plans gradually to expand production from 67,000 barrels a day to
700,000 b/d by 2010.
But Russia has restricted exports to just over 20,000 b/d, claiming the
presence of the corrosive contaminant mercoptan makes larger shipments
unacceptable. The two sides have also failed to agree over the route of a
new pipeline to carry the increased volume of exports.
Western diplomats say Mr Yuri Shafrannik, the Russian energy minister, has
made it clear that Russia also wants a share of Karachaganak, located in
northern Kazakhstan near the Russian border.
They say British Gas and Agip would probably have to reduce their
prospective shareholdings to accommodate a Russian stake. This would be a
departure from a precedent set in neighbouring Azerbaijan, where Russian
political pressure recently caused the Baku government to accept a dilution
of its stake in a consortium being led by British Petroleum to accommodate
the Russian integrated oil company, Lukoil.
A Kazakh official said it might offer a 3-4 per cent equity stake to
Transneft, a Russian state-owned pipeline operator. But several western oil
executives in Alma Ata said the final stake was likely to be closer to 10
per cent.
The prospect is making some western executives nervous. 'We've already got
so many problems that if Russia does get these shares it's going to scare a
lot of people,' said one.

The World Bank has extended to June 30 the deadline for the Philippines to
comply with terms attached to the second and last tranche of an economic
integration loan (EIL), Mr Callisto Madavo, World Bank director for the East
Asia and Pacific region, said yesterday, AP-DJ reports from Manila.
Mr Madavo said the bank had to move back the original December 1993 deadline
to give the government more time to meet the remaining conditions attached
to the EIL, notably liberalised import of used trucks and buses and the
easing of restrictions on farm imports, specifically maize.
Local officials are still trying to amend existing rules to be able to avail
the Philippines of the Dollars 200m (Pounds 136.9m) left in the EIL.
During the same news conference, Mr Lewis Preston, World Bank president,
asked the government to address business concerns about the deterioration of
the country's education system and the poor state of local infrastructure.
He said, however, that despite these factors, the World Bank was still
convinced the Philippines would succeed in carrying out its economic plans
and that the bank 'will continue to give strong support to the Philippine
government on its development efforts'.

FT  18 MAR 94 / Mahathir at last gets Sabah to bow to Kuala Lumpur: Kieran
Cooke on the struggle for control of a Borneo state
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sabah prides itself on being exotic. The East Malaysia state on the island
of Borneo called 'The land beneath the wind' by the early explorers, is home
to the Rafflesia, one of the world's largest flowers.
Sabah's Mount Kinabalu is south-east Asia's highest mountain - an outcrop
said to be home to spirits who have to be appeased by the yearly slaughter
of a dozen white chickens. Orang-utans, once adopted as domestic pets, are
taught the ways of the jungle at the state's special animal rehabilitation
centre.
Then, for the really exotic, there is Sabah politics.
For years Sabah, the former British north Borneo, was run like a private
fiefdom by local politicians who plundered the state's vast timber reserves
to accumulate fortunes.
One chief minister kept luxury cars in several European capitals and thought
nothing of having his favourite violin flown to his holiday home in London
in a specially chartered aircraft.
Yesterday Malaysia's ruling National Front coalition led by Dr Mahathir
Mohamad, the prime minister, finally won control of the local assembly in
Sabah. Now only one state in the Malaysian federation - the Moslem
fundamentalist ruled state of Kelantan - is not part of the National Front.
Dr Mahathir has had a tough fight taming Sabah. The locally constituted
Sabah Unity Party (PBS) had ruled the state for nine years. Sabah's 1.8m
people are a mixture of races and religions: the PBS, while dominated by
local Kadazan tribal Christian groups, prided itself on being a multi-racial
and multi-religious party, with a following among Moslem, Chinese and other
communities.
On the eve of Malaysia's last general elections in 1990, Mr Joseph Pairin
Kitingan, the leader of the PBS, took his party out of the National Front.
Dr Mahathir was enraged, saying Mr Pairin had 'stabbed the National Front in
the back'. The prime minister vowed to bring Sabah back under National Front
control and rid the state of Mr Pairin.
Local elections last month were a bitterly fought affair. The PBS accused Dr
Mahathir's government of withholding much needed development funds from the
state. Mr Pairin said the National Front was buying votes to the extent that
it was 'dropping money out of helicopters'.
Dr Mahathir said that Mr Pairin and the PBS had held up Sabah's economic
development. Only when the National Front gained control would the state be
able to progress like the rest of Malaysia.
The PBS achieved a narrow victory, winning 25 seats in Sabah's 48-seat
national assembly.
Sabah's politicians hop from one party to another like frogs at a fireworks
display. In the days after the election Mr Pairin said millions of dollars
were being offered to PBS assembly members to defect to the National Front.
With PBS's majority in danger Mr Pairin applied to the state's governor to
dissolve the assembly and hold new elections.
In what was rapidly descending into political farce, Mr Pairin said the
governor first agreed, then disagreed, with his request. Meanwhile PBS
members were hopping away - some to the National Front, others to form their
own political parties.
Among them was Mr Jeffrey Kitingan, a younger brother of Mr Pairin. Mr
Jeffrey Kitingan, elected to a PBS seat in the recent election, was released
from detention late last year after being held for three years on suspicion
of wanting to take Sabah out of the Malaysian federation.
But now the younger Kitingan is on good terms with Dr Mahathir and says his
new party, so far a one-man show, will join the National Front.
As a result of the PBS defections and the formation of various splinter
parties, the National Front was yesterday able to declare itself the party
of power in Sabah.
'It is a sad decision for me but I truly feel this is the most honourable
thing to do under the present circumstances,' said Mr Pairin, resigning as
chief minister.
Politics in peninsular Malaysia is divided on religious and racial lines,
with the majority Malay Moslems, the Chinese and the Indians all having
their own political parties. Sabah has had a different tradition: critics of
Dr Mahathir say that the peninsula's racially divisive politics will now be
imported into Sabah and could create tensions.
But the National Front is likely to bring plenty of money to the state.
Businessmen once fearful of investing in Sabah for fear of upsetting Dr
Mahathir are now likely to flood in. There is already talk that a ban on the
export of logs imposed by the PBS to preserve the state's dwindling timber
reserves will be lifted.
Having finally tamed Sabah, the National Front is unlikely to loosen its
grip. Perhaps 'The land beneath the wind' will not be quite so exotic any
more.

FT  18 MAR 94 / Japan consumers spend less
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's difficulties in reviving flagging consumer demand were underlined
yesterday by the first annual decline in household spending for 12 years.
Japanese households spent on average 0.6 per cent less in real terms last
year than in 1992, but set aside their spare cash for repaying debts rather
than saving, the government's management and co-ordination agency said.
They spent less on food and clothes, reflecting the austerity imposed by the
recession as well as a switch away from the conspicuous consumption of the
late 1980s. By contrast, spending on cars, medicine and utility bills rose.
Two signs that Japan might be near the trough of its downturn emerged
yesterday with a slowdown in the pace of corporate profits decline and a
slight recovery in money supply. Average pre-tax profits fell 6.2 per cent
in the final three months of last year, compared with the same period of
1992, the Finance Ministry announced.
That makes a record 14 quarters of decline, but the decline was far less bad
than the 21.6 per cent fall in the previous quarter, from July to September.
The pace of decline in turnover has also slowed, to 1.4 per cent.
Japan's money supply yesterday reversed a four-month slide, indicating that
the government's economic stimulus packages might be starting to have some
effect.
The broad measure of M2 and certificates of deposit, watched by the Bank of
Japan in setting monetary policy, rose 1.6 per cent last month, from
February 1993, continuing a revised 1.6 per cent rise in January.
Money supply had fallen steadily from September to the end of last year.
One worrying sign was a record 16.8 per cent decline in capital investment
in the final quarter, a reflection of Japan's high real long-term interest
rates and companies' general reluctance to add capacity.
The recent rise in long-term bond yields yesterday led to a rise in an
important government lending rate, likely to feed through to a rise in
state-backed mortgage payments and government loan costs for small
businesses.
The Finance Ministry increased by 0.65 percentage points to 4.3 per cent its
so-called 'zaito' rate for lending post-office savings to other government
institutions, the first rise since last June.

FT  18 MAR 94 / Buthelezi warns of a 'liberation war'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ULUNDI, KWAZULU
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A liberation war lies ahead if the South African government crushes
opposition to April's all-race elections, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, leader
of the Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom party, warned yesterday.
Inkatha seemed almost certain to act on its threat to boycott the poll,
after Chief Buthelezi took a hard line on participation in a speech to the
legislative assembly of the KwaZulu homeland which he heads, and after
last-ditch talks planned for today between the Zulu King Goodwill Zwelethini
and African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela were called off.
The meeting, to have taken place at Ulundi, the KwaZulu capital, was
'postponed indefinitely' after the ANC said it believed Inkatha members
planned to assassinate Mr Mandela. They insisted the venue be changed after
learning that thousands of heavily-armed Zulus were expected to attend, but
Inkatha refused. The ANC had counted on a private meeting between the two
men, but Chief Buthelezi yesterday urged the king's supporters to attend.
Chief Buthelezi said the king would meet his subjects at Ulundi later today,
to inform them whether or not they should be preparing for elections in six
weeks' time. The chief implied King Goodwill would use that opportunity to
call for a boycott.
If he does so, it will be the first time the Zulu monarch has issued such an
instruction, and will dash remaining hopes on the part of the government and
the ANC that they could make a separate peace with the king to support
elections publicly, despite Inkatha's planned boycott. The king said there
would be 'rolling Zulu mass action' unless his demands for Zulu sovereignty
were met.
Chief Buthelezi yesterday accused the government and the ANC of trying to
overthrow his government. 'Agitators attempting to destabilise the KwaZulu
government are trying to use the same tactics adopted against the government
of Bophuthatswana,' he said. The government was ousted there last week
through a combination of civil servants' strike, popular protest, security
force mutiny and the intervention of South African troops.
If troops were sent into KwaZulu, the chief said, this would 'spawn a
struggle for liberation from ANC/National Party oppression with no parallel
in Africa'. He warned of the 'highly explosive situation in KwaZulu', with
tension likely to rise further when the Independent Electoral Commission
acts, probably within a fortnight, to ensure political parties can campaign
freely in the homeland, and polling stations can be erected there.

FT  18 MAR 94 / Tunisians go to the polls tightly muzzled: Francis Ghiles on
an election that is a foregone conclusion but might prove a two-edged sword
for the winners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tunisians go to the polls on Sunday to elect a new president and parliament.
Whatever the turnout, the result is a foregone conclusion.
President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali is the sole candidate for the post he has
occupied since replacing an ailing Mr Habib Bourguiba in November 1987,
while the Democratic Constitutional party (RCD), which has held a monopoly
of seats in the national assembly since independence nearly 40 years ago, is
assured of a massive majority.
A more liberal electoral law allows proportional representation in 19 new
seats added to the existing 144 winner-takes-all seats. This will ensure
opposition parties a few political crumbs.
The one party that might have provided serious opposition, the Islamic Al
Nahda (Renaissance) party, is banned. Many of the party's supporters have
fled into exile. Mr Rashid Ghannoushi, its leader, was granted political
asylum in the UK last summer.
Supporters of Al Nahda in Tunisia and their families have faced a systematic
campaign of intimidation by the security forces.
Many remain in prison and, according to the human rights organisation
Amnesty International, some have 'disappeared' while others have been
ill-treated, sometimes tortured. In a report last January Amnesty wrote that
'by perpetually denying, in the face of compelling evidence, that torture
occurs and by failing to take action against it, the government has in
effect encouraged the continuation of a practice it professes to abhor'.
It added that 'Tunisia's growing mastery in deploying the vocabulary and
diplomacy of human rights abroad serves to mask a practice of serious and
systematic human rights violations at home'.
These are harsh words, but senior western diplomats do not dispute them, at
least in private. They point to what they see as the widening of the circle
of repression to include the arrest of Mr Hamma Hammami, the leader of the
illegal Tunisian Communist Workers' party (PCOT), on February 14, and to the
failed attempt by the former president of the Tunisian League of Human
Rights, Dr Moncef Marzouki, to stand against Mr Ben Ali. The constitution
demands that candidates find 30 deputies or mayors to endorse them. As
virtually all such people belong to the RCD, Dr Marzouki failed.
Meanwhile, censorship of the media remains tight.
Two weeks ago Mr Robert Pelletreau, US assistant secretary of state for
near-Eastern affairs, told the House foreign affairs committee: 'Tunisia's
economic development is the achievement of a well educated and hard working
population with a vigorous middle class. This is a principle strength of
Tunisian society. Tunisia's people deserve an equal measure of political
freedom and pluralism, and we believe it should be possible to handle
challenges from the extremes even in this volatile part of the world without
compromising these principals.'
He went on to argue that Tunisia's political system would 'benefit from
greater openness', a view shared by 'many Tunisians from within and outside
the government'.
Tunisian officials point to the incipient guerrilla war in neighbouring
Algeria which, they argue, poses a big threat to their country's hard-won
economic prosperity. It is not easy, they say, to be sandwiched between
Algeria and the maverick Libyan leader, Colonel Muammer Gadaffi.
Such concerns are genuine and are shared by most of Tunisia's 8m people. But
they do not answer the question of how, in the longer run, the regime hopes
to win the battle of ideas against proponents of radical Islam.
Avoiding the extremes of poverty and wealth, and ensuring relative economic
prosperity, are two keys to this battle. Economic growth has in recent years
been impressive - 8.1 per cent in 1992, 2.5 per cent last year and it is
forecast to reach 6 per cent this year; inflation was halved between 1991
and 1993 to 4 per cent; and a steady flow of foreign investment has followed
liberalisation of the economy. The first-ever private placement for Tunisia,
a Y30bn (Pounds 191.1m) Samurai bond arranged last month, underlined the
confidence of international bankers in the future of North Africa's smallest
state.
But even sympathetic observers say it bodes ill for the future if the very
professional people and intellectuals, on whose ideas the regime relies to
ensure Tunisia's continued progress, know they are being closely monitored
by the security forces. Few people in Tunis believe that Dr Marzouki, had he
been allowed to run against Mr Ben Ali, would have constituted a real threat
to the president's re-election. But such a campaign might have produced an
interesting trial run for future elections. In that sense an opportunity has
been missed, they say.
Approval of the well managed economy and fear of radical Islam has made many
western politicians and diplomats hesitate to air their criticisms in
public. If however, in the months ahead, the Algerian Islamic Salvation
Front either comes to power or ends up sharing it with the Algerian army,
then Tunisia could be in for a rude awakening.
Its leaders have voiced their fear of radical Islam for so long that they
have convinced many Europeans that Tunisia could be the next domino to fall.
This is disputed by many seasoned observers of Tunisia. They fear that the
suppression of public debate on a wide range of topics and the muzzling of
associations not directly sponsored by the government have deprived the
president of safety valves. Were his policies ever to be seriously
contested, Mr Ben Ali would be in the direct line of fire.

FT  18 MAR 94 / Italian Elections (March 27): Battle in outpost to open road
to Rome - Robert Graham reports from the port city of Trieste, where
electioneering differs from the rest of Italy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Few places feel as far away from Rome as Trieste, the once proud port city
of the Austro-Hungarian empire, which looks across the placid waters of the
Adriatic to the Italian peninsular.
The chatter of Slav languages can be heard down by the wharves. Dotted about
the city is an array of buildings and monuments attesting to a polyglot
influence from north and central Europe, including a staircase dedicated to
the sojourn of James Joyce.
Not surprisingly the general election campaign has a distinctive local
flavour. This is dictated by the 25,000-strong Slovene-speaking community
and by the irredentist demands of the right for a return of large parts of
Istria, territory lost by Mussolini's adventurism and formally alloted under
the 1975 Treaty of Osimo to Yugoslavia, now complicated by the break-up into
neighbouring Slovenia and Croatia.
Trieste is the sole place in north and central Italy where the neo-Fascist
MSI movement, recently re-baptised the National Alliance, is running
candidates independent of media magnate Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia
movement. The MSI accounts for more than 20 per cent of the vote, feeding on
the 350,000 Italians in the region forced out of Istria and still hoping to
recover property. Mr Gianfranco Fini, the movement's leader, has chosen
Trieste as one of the seats he is contesting for the chamber of deputies
under proportional representation rules.
Politically, the city also set an unusual precedent in municipal elections
last December. Mr Riccardo Illy, dubbed 'the king of coffee' because of his
big family coffee business, was elected mayor without any previous political
experience and refuses to draw an official salary.
He beat off a close challenge from the populist Northern League of Mr
Umberto Bossi with the support of eight parties from the left and centre.
'The big change since the municipal elections has been the appearence of
Berlusconi's Forza Italia movement,' says Mr Illy.
Forza Italia only appeared here towards the end of February. Already more
than 50 Forza Italia supporters' clubs have sprung up in the city and the
surrounding region. All this is the result of its enormous resources
deployed nationwide.
Indeed, the Trieste operation epitomises the way Mr Berlusconi's Fininvest
media group has been used to provide a national organisational framework for
his political ambitions. The Forza Italia movement in many respects is
little more than a political front for Fininvest.
In Trieste Forza Italia's headquarters are almost opposite the Fininvest
offices so that personnel can move between the two. Mr Pasquale Maurizio
Loria, Forza Italia's Trieste campaign co-ordinator, has taken unpaid leave
from being a local Fininvest television network manager.
'You must realise that I am talking under my Forza Italia hat,' he insists
politely, sitting in the Fininvest offices.
However, his office bustles with election phone calls. Piled on a desk are
videos on a dozen different topics of Forza Italia's programme. These videos
bear the distinctive insignia of Diakron - the polling and marketing company
controlled by Fininvest.
Even Forza Italia's hastily selected main candidate for the chamber, Mrs
Antonietta Vascon, a television documentary producer and commentator with no
previous political experience, is linked to the Berlusconi empire. She
appears on one of the Fininvest channels discussing Trieste issues.
The Trieste constituency consists of 270,000 voters, split into two chamber
seats on the new majority vote system and one for the old proportional
representation system, plus one senate seat. Here, as in the rest of
northern Italy, Forza Italia is allied with the League and a breakaway
faction of the old Christian Democrat party.
The polls suggest this alliance has just more than a third of the vote,
slightly ahead of the Progressive Alliance led by the former-communist Party
of the Democratic Left (PDS). Much of Forza Italia's strength, however,
comes from previous League supporters - in turn defectors from the former
Christian Democrats who used to account for a quarter of the vote. Even
though Forza Italia and the League each agreed to field one candidate for
the two majority-vote chamber seats, the alliance is not easy.
'It is natural that some of our League vote goes to Forza Italia. We have
lost some appeal as a new party,' says League candidate Gualberto Niccolini,
a well-known local sports journalist. He can afford to be more relaxed as he
has the easier of the two seats. The other seat covers a more industrial
belt with a strong Slovene presence long cultivated by the left.
Mr Renato Kneipp, the Progressive Alliance candidate in this constituency,
is a popular Slovene. However, the League and Forza Italia are trying to
discredit Mr Kneipp by stressing his membership of Reconstructed Communism,
the hardline rump of the old Communist party which refused to join the PDS.
'The PDS said it broke with communism and now they are allied with people
who still call themselves communist,' says Mr Niccolini.
of backing parties and candidates that address local issues. Today this
means those seen as most capable of pressing for the city's free port and
offshore financial status, developing high-tech jobs linked to the
prestigious Trieste university and arguing for a voice in the fast changing
world on its frontiers.

FT  18 MAR 94 / Kinkel: undiplomatic voice abroad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Francois Scheer, France's extremely able and experienced ambassador to
Germany, was not the only man in the firing line in Bonn yesterday.
To be sure, his injudicious briefing of German correspondents on current
strains in the vital Franco-German relationship was the immediate cause of
an audible outburst of German indignation.
German officials were adamant that he had been 'summoned' to the Foreign
Ministry to explain himself, and persuaded to issue a retraction of his
reported words. The French version was that the meeting was pre-arranged,
and the whole affair blown up out of all proportion. Yet behind the
diplomatic flurry, and the anxious telephone calls between Bonn and Paris,
lay the hand of the man who was clearly the target of much of the real
French concern about Germany's new foreign policy style and direction: Mr
Klaus Kinkel, the foreign minister.
It is his manner of speaking and short fuse in delicate negotiations which
have clearly upset some of his counterparts, both in Paris and Brussels. He
is clearly a man who arouses strong feelings on both sides.
'He is like a breath of fresh air,' according to one European diplomat in
Bonn. 'He is certainly a bit of a bull in a china shop, but sometimes
deliberately so. That is his way of getting things done.' One member of the
French government puts it rather differently, albeit diplomatically: 'We
have been a little upset by his dynamism,' he said yesterday.
In Brussels, officials involved in the recent enlargement negotiations on
the admission of Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden into the EU -
negotiations on which the German government set great store - described his
behaviour as 'extraordinary'.
'He was cursing people on all sides, saying he was wasting his time,'
according to one senior official. 'He managed to offend the Spanish, the
Irish, the Norwegians and the French, to mention just a few.'
Yet he has his admirers. One fairly neutral observer declared: 'The
enlargement talks were his finest hour. If it had not been for Kinkel, they
would never have been finished. 'The Germans moved in and took over the
whole thing. They set up informal working groups under German chairmanship.
It was a thoroughly impressive operation.'
Mr Kinkel is the unlikely combination for a foreign minister of an
undiplomatic, unpolitical animal. Yet he was singled out by his former boss
and mentor, Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, as the right man to take over his
mantle, not only as foreign minister but also as leader of the Free
Democratic party, the eternal king-makers in the German system of coalition
governments.
The pressure on him today is enormous. Not only does he have to carry out
all the functions of a foreign minister, but he also has to rescue his party
from the threat of political oblivion. The FDP slumped last weekend in the
state elections in Lower Saxony below the magic 5 per cent needed to gain
any seats. It was a result certain to fuel grumbling about his leadership.
His lack of frontline political experience also makes him hypersensitive to
criticism. 'He has a very short fuse, and he is sensitive about being
sensitive,' one Bonn observer said yesterday. 'He is under attack on the
domestic front, where his party is in grave trouble. And he faces criticism
about his lack of diplomacy.
'Mr Scheer could scarcely have chosen a worse moment to criticise him
personally.'

FT  18 MAR 94 / Doctors in Sweden fight PM's cure-all
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Pressures building over two years of reform and spending cuts in Sweden's
health service, a central pillar of the country's famous welfare system,
have come to a head this month in the form of a rare strike by doctors.
Thousands of non-urgent operations have already been postponed in hospitals
around the country because of two successive two-and-a-half day stoppages by
surgeons and doctors in a dispute over weekend and night-duty pay rates and
the implementation of a new liberal system governing family doctors. With no
sign of a breakthrough in negotiations, the Swedish Medical Association,
whose 24,000 members represent 95 per cent of the country's doctors, has dug
in its heels, calling out 2,600 of its members for a third round of
selective strikes next week.
The dispute springs directly from efforts by the right-centre government of
the prime minister, Mr Carl Bildt, which came to power in late 1991, to both
liberalise the monolithic health service and squeeze savings out of a system
which until recently put Sweden among the highest spenders on health as a
proportion of GNP within the OECD.
The current row revolves around a reform which for the first time gives
Swedes the right to choose their individual family doctor and which gives
doctors the right to set up private practices independent of the local
authorities.
A further change, due to take effect next month, will also allow specialist
doctors to set up privately for the first time. Neither step amounts on its
own to a splintering of the system. So far fewer than 1,000 doctors have
opted to go private, while the majority are apparently content to remain
within the governance of the local health authorities.
The reforms are part of a general thrust by the Bildt government to
introduce greater competition into the system - a move fiercely resisted by
the opposition Social Democratic party, the architect of Sweden's welfare
edifice. If Mr Bildt should win the general election in September (which the
polls suggest is unlikely) he would like to move on to allowing the
establishment of private hospitals in Sweden outside local authority
control.
The medical association, ironically, is in principle in favour of greater
freedoms for its members. But it is objecting to a proposal that family
doctors who are chosen by fewer than 1,000 patients should be fired by the
local authorities, regardless of their length of service.
The second dispute is about proposals by the local authorities - who
negotiate centrally with the medical association - to cut higher weekend and
night-duty pay rates for doctors to compensate for health spending cuts.
According to the association of county councils, overall health service
spending has been cut by SKr5bn (Pounds 425m) in each of the last two years,
bringing annual spending down to SKr116bn, or about 7.5 per cent of GNP, one
of the lowest levels in the OECD.
Further cuts this year are set to take up to another 4 per cent out of
spending. Up to 25 per cent of surgical beds have been closed and some
30,000 jobs have been cut from the health service workforce, which is now
down to around 400,0000, or one tenth of the country's workforce.
Other savings have been achieved through widespread contracting out of
services such as catering and laundry. Mr Bildt's government says the
changes have made the system more efficient, but doctors appear to be facing
surprisingly little public criticism of their strike action, which has not
affected emergency services.

Six Turkish MPs, representing radical Kurdish groups, were charged yesterday
and could face the death penalty if convicted for offences against the unity
of the state. Mrs Tansu Ciller, the prime minister, said the MPs were
surrounded by a 'cloud of terrorism' which linked them to the outlawed
Kurdish Workers' party.

Mr Waldemar Pawlak, Poland's prime minister, is to ask President Lech Walesa
to appoint Mr Dariusz Rosati, an advocate of free-market reforms, as deputy
prime minister and finance minister. Mr Rosati, 48, an economics professor,
is expected to pursue a financial austerity policy. He was proposed by the
leftist Alliance to replace Mr Marek Borowski, who resigned over policy
differences with Mr Pawlak. Mr Rosati is head of the East and Central
European section of the United Nation's Economic Commission.

About 440,000 German bank employees yesterday accepted a 2 per cent pay
rise, bolstering hopes that non-inflationary pay settlements can be achieved
across the board in Germany. After four rounds of talks and a final 12-hour
session, agreement was reached in line with earlier pay rises for
engineering and public sector workers but below forecast annual inflation of
3 per cent. Construction, textile and print workers are the only big labour
groups who have yet to negotiate a pay deal this year. Michael Lindemann,

Evidence emerged yesterday that France and Germany, Europe's two biggest
economies, are emerging from recession more strongly than expected. In
France the National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies predicted
growth of 0.7 per cent in the first half, up from December's forecast of 0.5
per cent. The revision is because of unexpected strength in household
spending and exports. And in Germany, Mr Tyll Necker, head of the BDI
industry federation, detected the first signs of recovery, saying industry
was receivinga small boost from increasing export orders. Mr Edmond
Alphandery, the French economics minster (left), was buoyant: 'Everything is
going in the right direction. All our forecasts are being confirmed and, day
after day. statistics prove the government's scenario is realistic,' he
said. However, Insee expects unemployment to rise to 12.7 per cent. Mr
Necker admitted inland consumer and investment demand remained weak, a view
endorsed by the Federation of German Retail Traders who said retail sales in
western Germany would fall up to 4 per cent this year.

Spanish authorities yesterday imposed fines of Pta1.8bn (Pounds 8.65m) the
Kuwait Investment Office's collapsed Spanish holding company and its
affiliates for failing to declare share purchases made in 1990 and 1991.
Grupo Torras, which went into receivership in 1992, was fined Pta1.3bn and
the Dutch company Kokmeeuw Holdings Pta500m. Smaller penalties of Pta5m were
imposed on KIO's former Spanish agent Mr Javier de la Rosa, an investment
company owned by him and another investment unit controlled by KIO. The case
involved indirect purchases to increase the group's stake in the Ercros
chemical concern and Prima Inmobiliaria, a property company, said Spain's
National Securities Market Commission. Under Spanish law, purchases of more
than 5 per cent in a traded company must be declared. The fines, are subject
to appeal.

</HEADLINE>

   Paris
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Demonstrators and police clashed in Paris yesterday after French trade
unions and student groups joined forces to protest against a law which they
claim undermines the minimum wage but which the government sees as vital to
reduce youth unemployment. More than 30,000 demonstrators took part in the
protests in Paris, which were the first to bring concerted action by the
largest union groups and student organisations. Clashes erupted on the
fringes of the march, with some demonstrators throwing stones and bottles at
riot police. About 200 demonstrators were arrested. Tens of thousands of
demonstrators also joined protest marches in provincial cities including
Bordeaux, Lille and Lyons.
The protestors say the law, which allows apprentices between 16 and 25 to be
paid less than the minimum wage of FFr5,866 (Pounds 671) per month,
undermines workers' rights and forces the young to pay for their training.
Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister, sought to ease concerns in an open
letter published in the daily Liberation. 'Do you really think that the
government would deliberately seek to harm the young?,' he asked. 'Our only
motive is to end the situation where 750,000 youth are deprived of a job. .
. I refuse to allow one in four young people to remain on the wayside.' He
stressed he had already made concessions, exempting young people with
university or technical diplomas from the lower wage, which will apply to
unqualified young job-seekers. He offered further talks on improvements to
the system and promised to review it after a year. Mr Balladur's letter
reflects the government's concern about the level of opposition to the law.
Yesterday's protests were the fourth significant demonstration against the
measures, and were called despite government concessions. France has the
highest unemployment rate among Group of Seven industrial powers with 12.2
per cent out of work and one young person in four under 25 is without a job.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Italy's budget deficit fell by 3.3 per cent last year but was still
marginally higher than forecast at L153,539bn (Pounds 62bn). This compares
with a projection of L151,200bn and the previous year's L158,840bn.
Excluding interest payments on the rising debt stock, there was a surplus
close to 2 per cent of gross domestic product. Although austerity measures
to contain public borrowing were the harshest applied by any EU member, the
deficit still represented almost 10 per cent of GDP. Italy is committed to
bring the deficit within Maastricht convergence criteria to around
L106,000bn (5.8 per cent of GDP) by 1996. The 1994 budget envisages a
deficit of about L151,000bn.
Consumer prices in the Netherlands rose 0.5 per cent in February from the
previous month and were 3 per cent higher than a year earlier. Excluding
indirect taxes, the February consumer price index was up 2.5 per cent from a
year earlier and 0.6 per cent up from January.
Swedish consumer prices rose 0.3 per cent in February, and 1.9 per cent
since February last year.

FT  18 MAR 94 / Recovery in car sales faltering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The recovery in west European new car demand faltered in February, with
sales rising by less than 1 per cent to 926,000 units from 919,000 a year
ago.
In January, sales increased by around 7 per cent year-on-year, halting 12
months of unbroken decline in the European market.
In the first two months of the year new car sales at 1.96m were an estimated
4.1 per cent higher than a year ago.
Sales in the whole of 1993 fell by 15.2 per cent to 11.45m units, the
steepest decline in the post-war period.
The renewed weakness in demand comes as the European Commission and the
Japanese Ministry for International Trade and Industry resume negotiations
today in Tokyo on the level of Japanese car and light commercial vehicle
exports to the European Union this year.
Sales in the EU fell by 15.9 per cent to 11.74m vehicles last year, while
direct vehicle exports from Japan to the EU were reduced by 18.4 per cent to
980,000 units. The Japanese share of the European market rose slightly,
however, as a result of increasing Japanese vehicle production in Europe.
Last month a recovery in sales in France and Spain and a strong increase in
the UK as well as in several smaller European markets helped compensate for
the continuing steep decline in new car demand in Italy and the weakness of
the German market.
In February new car sales were higher than a year ago in 12 of 17 markets
across west Europe. Demand rose year-on-year by 14.8 per cent in the UK, by
8.2 per cent in France and 6.1 per cent in Spain. New car sales fell by 15.7
per cent in Italy, however, following a drop of 20.4 per cent in 1993.

FT  18 MAR 94 / The conversion of Mr Chernomyrdin: Russia's so-called
conservative prime minister has become dedicated to reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the Russian prime minister, long regarded as a
conservative, is enjoying a second career - as a reformer. 'There is no
doubt he's serious,' said a senior US Treasury official this week. The
evaluation marks an apparently extraordinary turnabout.
The 55-year-old premier has been in office for a little over a year, since
taking over from Mr Yegor Gaidar at the end of 1992. Instantly seen as a
conservative from the energy lobby, the spoilt object of state investment -
he was formerly a Soviet oil and gas minister and head of the Gasprom gas
monopoly - he spent much of last year appearing grudgingly to go along with
reformist plans driven by deputy prime ministers like Mr Anatoly Chubais
(privatisation), Mr Boris Fyodorov (finance) and Mr Gaidar (economy).
Since the last two of these resigned in January, it has gradually become
clearer that Mr Chernomyrdin, and his first deputy prime minister Mr Oleg
Soskovets, wish to emerge as reformist figures and to be seen as men who are
as convinced of the necessity for the adoption of market principles as their
former colleagues. The evidence includes:
A continued insistence by Mr Chernomyrdin on a tight credit policy, of the
kind which brought down inflation to a low of 10 per cent last month. Mr
Chernomyrdin took exception two weeks ago, during a meeting of ministers,
senior officials and regional leaders, to a speech by Mr Victor
Gerashchenko, central bank chairman, in which his one-time ally said
inflation was less important than the maintenance of employment: for the
first time, in public, Mr Chernomyrdin underscored his difference of
principles with the bank chairman.
Perhaps because of this, Mr Gerashchenko has also kept the lid on credit
expansion this year: financial officials say that credit is running at only
40 per cent of the level permitted by the government's Credit Committee. A
commitment to radical measures - including land privatisation. Mr
Chernomyrdin went to Nizhny Novgorod last week and there enthusiastically
endorsed auctioning of land to the members of state and collective farms -
saying that he would ensure that the Nizhny model became a federal
programme. Nizhny Governor Boris Nemtsov, the symbol of regional reform, was
delighted.
The testimony of those close to him - notably that of Mr Peter Castenfelt, a
respected Swedish financier with a long record of working with Russia, who
last month was appointed adviser to Mr Chernomyrdin and Mr Soskovets on
enterprise reform. Mr Castenfelt last month pressed Mr Michel Camdessus, the
managing director of the International Monetary Fund, to accept the Russian
premier's reformist credentials.
'Mr Chernomyrdin is absolutely determined to keep to the budget,' said Mr
Castenfelt, now in Moscow. 'He's a real boss, and now he means business.
He's much more market-oriented than he's been represented - but he's been
burned by the criticism of him as a conservative and he feels isolated from
western opinion.'
However, Mr Chernomyrdin must be at least as tough - in fact, tougher - than
were Mr Gaidar or Mr Fyodorov, if his newly-minted credentials are to stand
the test. Yesterday he told the parliament's upper house that he had signed
the 1994 budget and passed it to parliament for consideration. That
'consideration' will be the first real test of the parliament's mood on the
economy.
It will, at the least, not be an easy ride: the Rbs183,000bn expenditure
envisaged has been greeted with threats of social explosion from all the
lobbies, especially from the army, and lobbies are well represented in both
houses of parliament. On the income side, the envisaged Rbs120,000bn is
unlikely to materialise: poor tax collection and declining profits have
meant that income is running at little more than half that annual rate.
If parliament rejects the budget, a very hard choice must be made. The
options are to bow to its will and print vast sums of money to cover a
budget even more in deficit than the proposed one; to resign; or to bring
the budget in under presidential decree - an option under the constitution.
Mr Chernomyrdin has stood with President Boris Yeltsin for the past year and
he stands or falls with Mr Yeltsin. For the moment, that means he stands for
reform.

FT  18 MAR 94 / Riot police oust Vladivostok's mayor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The elected mayor of Russia's far eastern city of Vladivostok was forcibly
removed from office by riot police yesterday after a raid on his office.
The move, officially described as the culmination of an investigation into
allegations of corruption, brings to the surface simmering disputes over
reform policies in a city where the growth of a free economy has been more
marked than any other in Russia, but where the state factories which provide
the bulk of employment fear collapse and where the population recorded some
of the highest votes for the ultra-nationalist and communist parties at the
parliamentary elections last December.
Mr Victor Cherepkov, elected mayor last year, was removed from the mayoral
building early yesterday by some 50 OMON riot police - though later reports
say he was not imprisoned and a local television report showed him lying on
a bed after suffering a heart attack. The deputy mayor, Mr Vladimir
Gilgenberg, was carried out of the building, according to the Tass official
news agency.
Mr Cherepkov, a former submarine captain, has been charged with bribery,
according to Mr Veniamin Chichayev, an aide to the regional prosecutor. Mr
Cherepkov has denied the corruption charges and says that political enemies
have been trying to remove him before next Sunday's elections to the
regional legislature.
Mr Sergei Filatov, chief of staff to President Boris Yeltsin, told Tass in
Moscow that the mayor had barricaded himself in his office and surrounded
himself by armed men. 'It seems his supporters were following the example of
the White House rebels,' he said, referring to the battle around the Russian
parliament last October.
Vladivostok's stock market, the most active in Russia, has boomed in recent
months - by trading shares in privatised companies. Vladivostok has led the
country in privatising its enterprises - but, in doing so, has appeared to
trigger a reaction from the state plant directors who see their power base
eroding and from workers who fear unemployment.
Mr Cherepkov has been feuding for months with the Moscow-appointed governor
of the Maritime Territory, Mr Yevgeny Nazdrazenko - who initiated the
allegations of corruption. Mr Nazdrazenko yesterday appointed Mr Konstantin
Tolstoshin, the unsuccessful candidate in last year's mayoral race, as
acting mayor.
Some 300 demonstrators turned out in support of Mr Cherepkov yesterday
morning, carrying placards reading 'No to lawlessness' and 'Shame on the
provocateurs'. Mr Vladimir Chilo, an engineer, said: 'The city is getting
impossible to live in. It is drowning in dirt and no one does anything.'
'While these officials are fighting, the city is falling apart,' said Mr
Vladimir Timoshenko, a taxi driver.
Mr Cherepkov is considered a reformer and has spoken in favour of closer
ties to the west. Mr Nazdrazenko also is believed to be pro-reform and the
mayor's removal appeared initially to be part of a local dispute.
Vladivostok, the base for the Russian Pacific fleet, was a closed city until
two years ago. Close to the Chinese border, its economy has been buoyed by
trade with its huge neighbour - but the success of Chinese traders in the
city and the surrounding region has also stimulated discontent and calls for
border controls.

FT  18 MAR 94 / Murdoch plans to axe BBC news from China satellite service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Rupert Murdoch is planning to stop beaming the BBC World Service
Television News into China, Taiwan and Hong Kong, apparently in response to
Chinese government sensitivities about television news from the west
delivered by satellite.
Mr Murdoch, who last year bought a controlling interest in Star TV, the
satellite system that broadcasts the BBC around Asia, is planning instead to
show a Chinese language film channel.
China recently clamped down on Star TV dishes and it has also expressed
anger with regard to a recent BBC documentary on the life of the late
Chinese leader Mao Zedong and references in programmes to the massacre which
took place in Tiananmen Square in 1989.
News Corporation and the BBC are already in dispute concerning the latter's
plans to launch an Arabic language television service aimed at the Middle
East, a service which would have overlapped geographically with the
five-channel Star service.
The main issue between the BBC and News Corporation, however, is the Star
television news contract and detailed negotiations have been going on for
some time.
Both sides have the right to terminate the contract at the end of this year
but Mr Murdoch wants to end the contract before then.
If agreement can be reached, however, the BBC is prepared to give up the
northern beam of the Star satellite system which broadcasts to China, Taiwan
and Hong Kong, in return for being able to stay on the southern beam which
covers India and the sub-continent, for up to 18 months.
That would give a breathing space to enable the BBC to move World Service
Television News to other satellites in the region, probably with new
partners.
If the BBC cannot reach agreement with Star, it will insist on the contract
being honoured until the end of the year.
According to The Far Eastern Economic Review, the new Chinese movie channel
replacing the BBC in China is to be launched in early May. Marketing plans
have been drawn up and printed material produced for cable television
operators in Taiwan.
In a London speech in September, Mr Murdoch emphasised how advances in the
technology of communications had proved an unambiguous threat to
totalitarian regimes everywhere. Satellite broadcasting in particular, Mr
Murdoch added, had made it possible for information-hungry residents of
closed societies to by-pass state-controlled television.
Last month, Mr Murdoch conceded at a New Delhi press conference that 'there
had been some sensitivity, particularly about beaming foreign news into
China. We certainly intend to do everything we can to resolve certain
difficulties with the government of China'.

FT  18 MAR 94 / EU offers compromise on voting: UK and Spain consider right
to two-month delay on Brussels decisions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER and DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain and Spain are being offered an automatic right to delay European
Union decisions for two months in an effort to resolve the crisis over entry
terms for Sweden, Finland, Austria and Norway next year.
The compromise being informally offered by the 10 EU partners falls short of
Anglo-Spanish demands to maintain present voting rules, whereby two big
countries and one small member state can combine to block decisions.
But it might allow London and Madrid to proclaim a partial victory in their
efforts to protect the interests of big member states when the union expands
from 12 to 16 countries.
The UK cabinet yesterday authorised Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, to
reach an agreement that falls short of Britain's present position. But he
was warned by colleagues that any deal must preserve the 'substance' of the
original position. Several ministers said that any compromise that could be
interpreted as a climbdown could cause 'uproar' in the party.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said the government
would continue to fight for Britain's interests at the heart of Europe.
At prime minister's questions, Mr John Major rebuked a Conservative
Euro-sceptic who tried to draw him on the negotiations. He said Mr Hurd
would defend 'Britain's best interests without any delay in enlargement'.
Tory Euro-sceptics, led by Mrs Ann Winterton, unsuccessfully demanded a
debate on the future shape of the EU.
Senior EU diplomats made clear that the 'delaying minority' formula was the
most the UK and Spain could expect when EU foreign ministers try, once
again, to break the deadlock at a meeting in Brussels next Tuesday. 'They
will not get all they want, but they will receive something,' commented one
official.
The compromise would give member states at risk of being outvoted an
automatic right to one month's delay. The rotating presidency of the EU and
the Commission would be asked to seek a consensus. The procedure could be
repeated, again for a month, at which point member states could take a
decision.
Mr Hurd has said the UK could live with a Spanish compromise on weighted
voting. That would increase the threshold of the 'blocking minority' from 23
to 27 votes; but it would not apply when three member states that together
have 23 votes and represent more than 100m people either oppose or abstain
on a measure.
However, the informed judgement in Brussels is that that formula is not
acceptable to the European Parliament, which must approve accession of the
four countries by May 4.
EU diplomats have also warned that several parliaments, notably those of
Belgium and the Netherlands, would refuse to endorse the Anglo-Spanish
proposals because they would paralyse decision-making and strengthen the
power of the bigger states.
A compromise on voting weights would remain in force until 1996.

FT  18 MAR 94 / MPs urge more access to funds for Post Office
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Post Office should be free to raise money outside the public sector
borrowing requirement to help it compete, an influential committee of MPs is
set to recommend.
In a report to be published next week, the trade and industry select
committee - on which the Conservatives have a majority - will urge the
government to disclose the findings of its review of the corporation as soon
as possible.
The review, which has been running for 19 months, was intended to help the
government decide how the Post Office should be run in the future, and to
assess the option of privatisation.
The trade and industry committee's report will argue that uncertainty over
government plans is putting the Post Office at a serious disadvantage
against domestic and foreign competitors, and that the status quo is not an
option.
But the report will stop short of proposing a specific plan to improve the
corporation's position.
The government's problems in devising a future for the Post Office have been
underlined by pressure from a powerful group of cabinet ministers to shelve
further radical legislation in the 1994-95 parliamentary session.
The move - intended to clear the way for the government to concentrate on
rebuilding its reputation ahead of the next general election - looks set to
delay indefinitely the Post Office's privatisation.
Several ministers have warned that privatisation of the Royal Mail would
invite strong opposition both in the Lords and among Tory MPs because of the
potentially damaging implications for rural services and post offices.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, told the trade and
industry committee last month that there was a strong economic case for
privatising the Royal Mail, but he indicated that he had been prevented from
doing so by political considerations.
He said the alternative to privatisation - the 'halfway house' of giving the
Post Office more commercial freedom within the public sector  - was proving
extremely difficult.

FT  18 MAR 94 / Son rises in the east for Hanson
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Is Hanson about to drop its simple strategy of being a company 'over here'
that also does rather well 'over there'? The Anglo-American conglomerate, is
joining the rush eastwards by opening a Hong Kong office.
The attack on Asia will be led by Mr Robert Hanson, 33-year-old son of the
chairman, Lord Hanson. He will chair Hanson Pacific, which will be run by
two new appointments to the group, Mr Simon Hsu, a former investment banker,
and Miss Yuen-Cheng Ng, a US-trained lawyer.
The subsidiary is intended to develop opportunities in Asia, but is unlikely
to cause an immediate shift in the source of profits.
Hanson expects the potential is largely for joint ventures for subsidiaries,
such as Peabody Coal, SCM Chemicals, Cavenham Forest Products and Imperial
Tobacco. The last is already looking at ways to develop in China. The new
office will supplement Hanson's interests in Australia, which include coal
and titanium dioxide, and where Mr Anthony Cotton, a Hanson high-flier, has
been sent to sort out Hanson's 40 per cent owned Renison Goldfields.
So far Mr Hanson's success as a corporate strategist has been limited. As a
main board member, his current role is to look for opportunities in Europe.
In October 1992, he implied that the group's next sizeable deal would be on
the continent. He had hardly spoken when Hanson launched a bid for Ranks
Hovis McDougall, a largely UK company. When that failed, the next move was a
classic Hanson-style US acquisition, buying Quantum Chemical last September.
Since then, Hanson has been selling rather than buying businesses to cut its
heavy debt.
Mr Hanson's new responsibility will give a chance to revisit haunts he
frequented in 1986-88, when working for the Hong Kong subsidiary of NM
Rothschild, the merchant bank.
His Hanson's appointment is not full time, and he will retain his European
role, working with Mr Christopher Collins, another main board director and
the husband of a niece of Lord Hanson.

FT  18 MAR 94 / Treasury gives Bank greater autonomy over gilts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN and CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Treasury yesterday announced it was giving the Bank of England greater
freedom to operate in the government bond market. Once annual guidelines on
funding policy have been set by the Treasury, the bank will be effectively
free to choose the timing and nature of gilt issues.
The change is another step towards giving the bank control over 'technical'
matters of financial policy with the Treasury retaining the power to decide
strategy. It follows the announcement last year by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the
chancellor, that the bank would have control of the timing of interest rate
cuts.
Analysts stressed the bank always had the main responsibility for the timing
of gilt issues and the announcement was unlikely to make much difference to
funding policy. Nevertheless, Mr Don Smith, UK economist at Midland Global
Markets, said: 'This move puts the Bank of England further along the road to
independence.'
Mr Simon Briscoe, UK economist at SG Warburg Securities, described the
change as 'a further important step towards bank freedom and towards a more
orderly market'.
Both the bank and the Treasury emphasised that the new structure is designed
to be more efficient.
In a statement, the Treasury said: 'In the past, individual decisions on
funding were taken after discussion between Treasury ministers, Treasury
officials, and the Bank of England. In future, any operations the bank
proposes that fall within the remit and the guidelines will normally be
approved by Treasury officials.'
A formal remit for the bank will be set out by the Treasury at the start of
the financial year, which will reveal the expected gross issues of gilts
needed to fund the borrowing requirement. Previously, gilts traders had been
forced to estimate this.
The bank set out its policy for the 1994-95 financial year yesterday. It
said the likely gross sales of gilts would be Pounds 37bn, and it would
continue to fund via a combination of monthly gilt auctions and sales of
stock 'on tap' in the secondary market. Individual auctions will be for
between Pounds 2bn and Pounds 4bn of stock and will normally be held on the
last Wednesday of the month.
The bank has called a meeting at 4pm today to discuss the new structure with
marketmakers, but the City welcomed the move. Mr John Shepperd, chief
economist at Yamaichi International Europe, said: 'This is a useful step in
terms of the transparency of the bank's operations.'

FT  17 MAR 94 / Reuters revises Globex contract
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BOCA RATON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Reuters, the UK information company, has agreed to continue its loss-making
venture into electronic futures trading by revising its Globex operating
contract with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
However, the revised contract has not been endorsed by the Chicago Board of
Trade (CBOT), the world's busiest futures exchange, and Reuters' other
partner in the Globex venture.
The new arrangement promises to shore up the flagging system, which was
designed to supplement daytime futures trading at the world's biggest
exchanges by providing after-hours electronic markets.
Reuters invested an estimated Dollars 100m (Pounds 68m) to develop Globex,
which carries futures and options products listed on the CME, the CBOT and
Matif, the French futures exchange. However, since its launch two years ago,
the system has drawn lower volume than forecast, and no other exchanges have
joined it.
This year, with volatile financial markets boosting derivatives contracts of
all kinds, Globex volume has risen, but still remains below target.
Wednesday's agreement provides a fallback two-year management plan for
Globex in case the current contract collapses next month.
In April either of the two Chicago futures exchanges or Reuters have the
option not to renew the existing contract.
The CBOT, wary of the threat electronic trading poses to its daytime
markets, and unwilling to carry expenses related to Globex operations, has
criticised the system and is not expected to renew its participation.
Under the new plan, Reuters releases participating futures exchanges from
having to guarantee large numbers of Globex terminal placements or pay
compensatory fees. The plan also relieves other financial obligations to the
exchanges, and creates a management consortium that gives any participating
exchange equal voice in governance.
Globex executives expected the new plan to appeal to other world futures
exchanges. In particular, they hope the terms will prompt a speedy
consideration of a 'new Globex' by London's Liffe.
Liffe is considered crucial to the long-term success of the project, and
would compensate for the absence of the CBOT. Globex executives are
continuing to try and preserve the the CBOT's participation in some form.

FT  17 MAR 94 / French deficit growth slows: Economic Watch
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The French budget deficit last year stood at FFr315.7bn (Pounds 36.2bn),
widening from 1992's deficit of FFr226bn, but FFr1.9bn below a previous
official estimate. Budget minister Nicolas Sarkozy said government policy
and the stirrings of economic recovery had put a stop to the upward drift in
the budget deficit. He said the Treasury's receipts were above expectations
last year, outstripping higher spending than expected. He said the sharp
fall in interest rates had allowed the state to save FFr16.5bn on debt
servicing.
Germany's income from federal and state taxes rose 2.4 per cent last year to
DM697.99bn (Pounds 271.5bn), of which general tax income rose 4.9 per cent
to DM562.27bn. Western German wholesale prices rose 0.5 per cent in February
and were up 0.3 per cent from a year earlier.
Eastern German unit labour costs remained 44 per cent higher than those of
western Germany in 1993, despite a sharp rise in the region's productivity.
Unemployment in the Netherlands surged 115,000 in the three months to
February to around 495,000 from a year earlier, its highest since early
1988, and just over 7 per cent of the workforce.

FT  17 MAR 94 / International Company News: Carrefour takes control of
Picard
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Carrefour, France's largest food retailing group, is set to take control of
Picard Surgeles, a private company which is one of the country's biggest
distributors of frozen food.
Carrefour said that it had reached agreement to raise its stake in the
company from 10 per cent to more than 50 per cent, although it declined to
specify the exact amount of its projected investment or the amount to be
paid.
Picard is the third largest distributor of frozen foods in France and is
particularly strong in the Paris region, where it has a market share of 24
per cent. Its turnover last year amounted to FFr1.6bn, while net profits
reached FFr61.7m.
According to Carrefour, the Decelle family, which established Picard
Surgeles in 1974, will remain active at both the management and shareholder
level.
Olivier Decelle and Xavier Decelle are currently chairman and managing
director respectively.
Carrefour has also announced that it is to enter the Mexican market through
the establishment of a 50-50 joint venture with Gigante. The new company
will develop large supermarkets.
The Mexican company, which has activities in food and electronics retailing
as well as cafeterias and restaurants, achieved sales of FFr14.3bn last
year.

FT  17 MAR 94 / Polisario snubs UN on W Sahara deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Polisario Front which has been battling Morocco for the independence of
the former Spanish colony of the Western Sahara since 1975, has rejected two
United Nations options for a settlement and expressed strong reservations
about a third.
Last weekend, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, proposed three
options to break a deadlock over the UN-sponsored peace plan, first proposed
in summer 1991, for a referendum on the fate of the disputed territory.
The first was to hold a referendum at the end of this year, irrespective of
whether either side had agreed on those Saharans entitled to vote. The
second was for the UN to drop the proposed referendum and withdraw most of
its peacekeeping force.
The third option would be for both parties to continue talking until the end
of June in the hope of reaching a compromise. Polisario could not support
the third option unless it was 'revised and reformulated'.

FT  17 MAR 94 / Suffering the politics of drought: Corruption and Kenya's
worsening famine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The worst drought in a decade is extending its grip on Kenya.
The government says 5m people - one-fifth of the population - are in need of
emergency food handouts. Maasai herdsmen in the Great Rift Valley have lost
250,000 head of cattle, and in the densely populated Eastern Province the
failure of the December rains has wiped out half the staple maize crop.
If the rains that are due to start this month fail again, 'a rapid
deterioration will result and famine relief may be required,' warns a cable
from a western embassy in Nairobi.
The drought comes at a delicate time for President Daniel arap Moi, who
recently abolished the government's maize trading monopoly at the insistence
of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. Until October it was
illegal for private traders to import maize into Kenya; until December it
was illegal to move it around the country. Price controls were lifted only
three months ago.
The private sector, however, does not yet have the ability to import the
vast quantities of maize needed this year. About 1.7m tonnes, or just over
half the national maize consumption, will have to be met by a combination of
commercial imports, government purchases and food donations.
The government recently hauled in private grain traders to berate them for
the paltry level of commercial imports. The traders retorted they did not
have enough market information with which to act. How many tonnes were
earmarked for free distribution? How many tonnes remained in the stocks of
the National Cereals and Produce Board, the former state monopoly? Under
what conditions would these stocks be released on to the market?
Western donors complain that the NCPB treats its maize stocks as a state
secret. This is not surprising, since the manipulation of stock levels feeds
a complex web of corruption which marketing reforms cannot fully eliminate.
A confidential study being circulated among embassies in Nairobi describes
in detail the 40 most common scams in NCPB grain depots and concludes: 'An
analysis of routine practices at a typical maize depot shows more than 60
per cent of the purchase value of all maize acquired by NCPB is lost due to
corruption at the depot level alone.'
Kenya's two biggest food donors - Usaid and the European Union - are urging
the government to use NCPB's stocks to meet the current food emergency. But
the government clearly expects the donors to cover the shortfall.
'There is a subtle kind of blackmail going on,' complains one ambassador in
Nairobi. 'If donors do not pledge the food aid being demanded by the
government of Kenya, this could be used as an excuse to reverse the grain
marketing reforms.'
He fears too much food aid would allow the NCPB to sell its maize to urban
consumers, pocket the proceeds and maintain the undesirable business
practices donors want stamped out.
Underlying this mistrust is the way food aid was commandeered for political
ends in the last grain emergency in the run-up to Kenya's first multi-party
elections in 1992. The United Nation's World Food Programme discovered that
donated maize was frequently diverted to areas where the ruling Kanu party
needed to drum up support. In other areas, food which was meant for free
distribution was sold by local officials.
This time round, WFP is organising its own transport to ensure there are no
diversions en route. It has also set up school feeding programmes and
appointed monitors to supervise the distribution of food aid in the local
communities. It expects to distribute about 150,000 tonnes of maize until
the next harvest in September. If there is another bad harvest, however,
Kenya's dependence on food handouts will continue until 1995.
The government, for its part, has set up a drought relief task force which
is importing 200,000 tonnes of maize for free distribution. Mr Philip
Mullei, a senior civil servant heading the Relief and Rehabilitation
Department, is confident no-one will starve.
High up in the Kipangot Hills, overlooking the Great Rift Valley, farmers
and their dependants are waiting for relief food to arrive. Their crops have
failed, cows have died, and many families have already eaten the seed grain
earmarked for the next ploughing season.
The politics of Kenya's modern rain gods have not been kind to these
communities.

FT  17 MAR 94 / Norway's opposition says referendum No vote likely
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FOSSLI and HUGH CARNEGY

<DATELINE>
   OSLO, STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Norway's main opposition Centre party yesterday denounced Oslo's accession
agreement with the European Union as a sell-out and predicted a repeat of
1972 when the electorate narrowly rejected an earlier application for EU
membership in a bitterly divisive referendum.
'This will be a fight on whether Norway will continue to be an independent
nation or whether we will hand ourselves over to a union,' declared Mrs Anne
Inge Lahnstein, the party leader.
Other powerful anti-European Union groupings comprising farmers and
fishermen also said they would fight against membership, ensuring the
expected tough battle for the minority Labour government in a new referendum
despite its insistence that it won a good deal, particularly on the highly
sensitive issues of fish and agriculture.
Like fellow Nordic EU applicants Finland and Sweden, Norway is unlikely to
set a referendum date until the remaining row over enlargement within the
EU's existing ranks is resolved.
But Finland is expected to vote in September or October, with Norway
preferring to wait until after Finland and Sweden have voted.
There remains sharp disagreement in Sweden over the referendum date. Mr Carl
Bildt, the prime minister, favours June or general election day in
September, but Mr Ingvar Carlsson, leader of the opposition Social
Democrats, said yesterday the dispute in Brussels over post-enlargement
voting rights strengthened the argument for delaying at least until the
autumn.
The internal EU row over enlargement is likely to stiffen the strong anti-EU
movements in the three countries which remain strong despite recent opinion
poll swings towards the Yes camp.
In Norway, where opposition is most entrenched, opposition groups said the
government had sacrificed vital national interests by agreeing to a deal
which would flood the country with cheap food imports and give away fish to
countries which had mismanaged their own resources.
Mr Einar Hepsoe, head of the Norwegian fishermen's association, said Norway
had lost on all accounts. 'This accord is worse than I feared when we began
negotiations,' he said.

FT  17 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Lasmo busy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There were distinct signs of unease around the oil exploration and
production sector as first Enterprise Oil, and then to a lesser extent
Lasmo, attracted sizeable selling pressure.
The latter was the market's second most heavily traded stock after a block
of 1.6m shares was sold into the market at 130p and quickly placed at 130
1/2 p, while a further 700,000 was bought and sold at a profit of only
0.25p.
Lasmo is scheduled to announce preliminary results next Wednesday and the
company's shares have held relatively steady in recent months in spite of
the continued weakness of crude oil prices, currently just above their
lowest levels for five years.
At the close Lasmo was marginally easier at 130p after turnover of 10m
shares, the highest single day's volume since December 10. Enterprise shares
dipped 4 to 411p.
Turnover in Rolls-Royce rose to 10m and the shares hardened 4 to 190p after
Henderson Crosthwaite issued a buy recommendation and upgraded current-year
profits estimates.
The broker raised its forecast by Pounds 10m to Pounds 120m and urged
investors to buy the stock, saying: 'Rolls-Royce is the premier investment
in the engineering sector, with a major appeal to international funds.' US
investment bank Lehman Brothers was also reported to have been a big buyer
of the shares.
Metals group Johnson Matthey firmed 3 to 568p after BZW issued a favourable
review on the stock. Worries about the pressure on profits in the cable
industry continued to hurt electricals group Delta. The shares gave up 13 to
509p, after a meeting with institutions.
Prospects of losing the benefit of the pension surplus from the balance
sheet, highlighted by Coats Viyella's figures, hurt Williams Holdings. The
shares relinquished 13 to 394p.
Legal &amp; General rose strongly against the market and closed 9 higher at
502p, ahead of this morning's preliminary figures and following good support
from James Capel and Robert Fleming Securities.
The latter, recommending the shares as a buy 'for the first time in many
months', pointed to the shares' yield premium of nearly 45 per cent and the
actual yield of almost 5.5 per cent. Fleming said: 'Worries about fines for
pension overselling are overdone.'
Stores analysts digested the details of the CBI retail sales survey, which
showed sales growth slowing for the second month in succession, and the
latest government figures. Great Universal Stores bucked the muted trend,
the shares firming 2 to 575p, on evidence of stronger mail order sales.
Brown and Jackson recovered a half-penny to 3 1/4 p after collapsing on
Tuesday on revealing disagreements with its bankers. Talk of a profits
downgrade in Kingfisher saw the shares slide 12 to 607p.
Leisure group Granada continued to see analysts and institutional investors
ahead of its closed season. The meetings kept the stock up for most of the
session, although it ended a penny off at 560p. Smith New Court reiterated
its positive stance, arguing that with BSkyB stripped out it deserved more
than a market rating.
Hotel stocks held firm, helped by Kleinwort Benson's latest research
suggesting that UK room demand in December was 9.4 per cent ahead of the
same period a year ago. Forte added a penny at 256p and Ladbroke was steady
at 207p.
Transport and property group P&amp;O, which reports next week, appreciated 8 to
689p after a BZW recommendation. The securities house expects the group to
report profits of Pounds 540m (including Pounds 300m of exceptionals.)
Channel tunnel operator Eurotunnel moved ahead 3 to 544p, with SG Warburg
said to have recommended the stock.
Fisons added 3 at 134p as US buying led to a return of bid rumours.
Reed International improved 2 to 905p ahead of figures due tomorrow.
Marketmakers were preparing themselves for the first day of trading in
Midland Independent, the newspaper group that includes the Birmingham
Evening Mail and Daily Post. The shares were offered at 140p, and some
dealers were suggesting that the shares, five times oversubscribed by
institutions, might open at a hefty premium.
A forecast upgrade in Cadbury Schweppes, said to be by company broker Hoare
Govett, helped the shares rise 3 to 499p. United Biscuits gained 5 at 338p
ahead of today's results, some buyers speculating that the rumoured
provisions may not be as bad as feared.

FT  17 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Schroders ahead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Schroders, the merchant bank, delivered the best individual performance of
any of the FT-SE 100 stocks as it announced net profits far in excess of
market expectations.
Net income amounted to Pounds 140.3m, compared with the most optimistic
forecasts of around Pounds 120m. The dividend total was also well ahead of
expectations.
Ironically, Schroders is one of the casualties of the most recent screening
of FT-SE 100 constituents and is scheduled to drop out of the UK market's
premier index as from Monday. Schroders ordinary were up 80 at 1170p, after
1185p, on turnover of 1m shares.
Schroders' doubled net profits followed similarly bumper results from other
merchant banks in recent weeks. SG Warburg, the UK's premier merchant bank
and also a FT-SE 100 constituent, managed only a slight improvement at 803p,
but Kleinwort Benson advanced 16 to 548p, Hambros 14 to 378p and Close
Brothers 15 to 540p.

FT  17 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Coats loses favour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Textiles leader Coats Viyella was the biggest casualty in the FT-SE 100
Index constituents yesterday as the company came out with a set of results
that looked good but failed to retain the market's enthusiasm. The shares
dropped 20 to 260p on turnover of 7.8m, far above average, in spite of a
Pounds 150.3m profit at the top of the range of analysts' estimates.
Analysts said that once the benefits of acquisitions and currency had been
stripped out, the underlying business had declined. Also the company
predicted flat sales in most of its markets, while material prices were
creeping upwards. However, more enthusiastic observers pointed out that the
stock had jumped from 259p just over a week ago. SG Warburg reduced its 1994
estimate by Pounds 15m to Pounds 160m.

FT  17 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The setback in UK gilts after the release of economic statistics brought a
sharp fall in stock index futures, writes Joel Kibazo.
The first trade in the Liffe March contract on the FT-SE 100 was struck at
3,266, off 6 points from its previous close. Sporadic buying in the initial
stages saw the contract advance to a high of 3,272.
The release of a clutch of UK economic data brought a reversal in the
fortunes of March as dealers reacted to the decline in UK bonds. The
contract fell back sharply, pulling the underlying cash market lower.
Traders also reported a significant amount of technical trading ahead of
tomorrow's expiry of March.
It finished at 3,238, down 34 from its previous close and at a four-point
discount to cash. Volume at the official close stood at 22,141 lots. June
ended the session at 3,247 on turnover of 9,044 contracts.
In the Liffe Mid 250 futures, 35 lots were dealt in the March contract,
which closed at 3,890, though volume in June was 120 contracts and it ended
at 3,910.
Business in the Liffe traded options was subdued and turnover came to 37,672
lots, of which 20,418 were in the FT-SE 100 option and 4,799 in the Euro
FT-SE 100 option. British Gas, the most active stock option, had 1,905
contracts dealt.

FT  17 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Wage cost data unsettle nervous share
prices - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Renewed weakness in British government bonds, following the latest data on
UK economic progress, brought losses in share prices in London yesterday.
Selling was not heavy, and equities were influenced by activity in stock
index futures ahead of the expiry tomorrow of important futures contracts.
The downturn in gilt-edged securities, and in sterling, discouraged London
from joining in the generally favourable response in other markets to the
reduction in rates at the Bundesbank money market tender, and to the 0.3 per
cent rise in the US consumer price index in February.
On the UK front, higher earnings and unit wage trends hinted at inflationary
pressures ahead, although a dip of 0.5 per cent in February retail sales was
seen as increasing the likelihood of an early base rate cut.
Equities opened steadily, taking the German repo rate news comfortably, but
turned down when UK bonds began to give way as the pound softened. Share
prices reacted quickly to bouts of selling of the March FT-SE 100 contract,
which expires tomorrow.
The Footsie slipped to 3,242.3 before steadying to show a final reading of
3,242.9, a loss of 24.5 on the day. Trading volume increased again, to
625.5m shares; Tuesday's 616m shares brought a retail worth of Pounds
1.41bn. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index fell 12.1 to 3,890.4, but the second-line
issues were somewhat overlooked as the futures markets cast their spell over
the blue chip issues.
Strategists found difficulty in explaining London's weakness in a session in
which other global markets held relatively steady in the face of
developments in German and US markets. Mr Nick Knight at Nomura Research
suggested that the UK stock market might react unfavourably to the base rate
cut widely expected soon, since it might be regarded as a move likely to be
reversed later in the year. Mr Robin Aspinall at Panmure Gordon commented:
'The Bank will not be happy if it is forced into a cut while sterling looks
fragile.'
Attention is likely to focus this morning on the policy meeting at the
Bundesbank. Analysts predict that, in the wake of yesterday's modest
trimming in repo yields, a reduction in the upper level Lombard rate is
possible today, although the key discount rate is not expected to change.
However, UK strategists now believe that the expected cut in UK base rates
hinges on domestic political factors, including next month's increase in
taxes, and the local authority elections in the UK.
Technical factors were blamed for the erratic movements in share prices over
the past week. The market is believed to have become oversold at the end of
last week and has now become over-sensitive to the price gyrations
associated with the expiry of derivatives instruments.
In their turn, these futures and options have traded through a difficult
period which has seen interest rates ease across Europe, and both the US and
UK stock markets undergo a significant correction from their post-Christmas
peaks. This has left fund managers and securities houses with substantial
futures trading positions which must be either rolled over to the next
expiry period or sold out.
These pressures are expected to increase as the stock market faces further
economic statistics from the UK and the US, culminating early next week in
the form of trade figures on both sides of the Atlantic.

FT  17 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Program sales erase late Dow
advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
A late rally by blue chip stocks was stopped cold by a burst of program
trading, but reassuring news on inflation and a firm bond market helped to
bolster the broader range of equities, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 1.44 off at 3,848.15, after
surrendering a 15-point gain in the final minutes of trading. But the more
broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 held on to a 2.41 advance to end at
469.42. The American SE composite moved 1.69 higher to 469.82, while the
Nasdaq composite climbed 5.47 to 798.99, around a point off its all-time
closing high. NYSE volume was 306.8m shares.
It was a day of sudden shifts on Wall Street. Until late afternoon, equity
investors were unable to establish a clear direction in spite of a welcome
decline in long-term interest rates, as reflected in the yield on the
30-year Treasury issue.
The long bond's improvement reflected further evidence of subdued inflation.
The Labor Department followed up Tuesday's favourable report on February
producer prices with consumer price data which matched the consensus
forecast of analysts. The CPI was up 0.3 per cent last month.
By late in the day, the return on the long bond had dropped by as much as 7
basis points to 6.80 per cent. That seemed to be enough to shake the blue
chips out of their torpor, and the Dow industrials were showing strong gains
in the last two hours.
However, the bubble burst as quickly as it was inflated. The Dow finished on
a disappointing note when a wave of program selling was triggered just
before the close of trade.
Among cyclical stocks, whose performance is closely linked to economic
trends, Caterpillar shed Dollars 1 to Dollars 115 3/4 , but Cummins Engine
jumped Dollars 4 5/8 to Dollars 50 3/4 and DuPont gained Dollars 1 1/8 at
Dollars 57.
Transport issues were wanted, with the Dow Jones Transportation Average
pushed 17.88 higher to 1,752.38.
UAL, parent of United Airlines, gained Dollars 2 3/8 at Dollars 131 3/8
after a union representative said talks with management were still under
way, although the deadline for concluding the Dollars 5bn buyout deal had
passed.
Federal Express was up Dollars 1 7/8 at Dollars 71 7/8 and Roadway Services
added Dollars 1 3/4 at Dollars 73.
In the energy sector, Amoco climbed Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 54 5/8 after
Dean Witter Reynolds said that an expected restructuring could improve
profitability.
Nike surged Dollars 4 1/2 to Dollars 57 1/2 amid optimism over the company's
future. After the close of Tuesday's trading, the Oregon-based athletic shoe
manufacturer said worldwide orders for delivery during its first fiscal
quarter were 4 per cent ahead of 1993 levels.
Investors also bought US Surgical on expectations of an imminent return to
growth. The stock rose Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 18 3/8 after the company
said it would stay in the black during the rest of the year.
On the Nasdaq, Aldus leapt Dollars 6 to Dollars 32 1/4 after the
announcement of a merger between the software developer and Adobe Systems,
down Dollars 3 at Dollars 29 1/2 .
Canada
Toronto posted another sizeable gain in active trading. The TSE 300 index
closed 25.1 higher at 4,525.7 and rises led falls by 455 to 346 after volume
of 86.8m shares. The mining group gained 2.33 per cent.

FT  17 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei average rises to
second 1994 high of the week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Tokyo
Share prices rose as heavy arbitrage buying and purchases by foreign
investors overwhelmed selling by companies and investment trust funds, and
the Nikkei 225 average climbed 0.8 per cent to another 1994 high in active
trading, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The index gained 168.92 at 20,677.77 after a day's low of 20,518.05 and high
of 20,781.98. A rise in the Nikkei futures market on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange on Tuesday prompted buying by futures traders in Osaka.
Volume increased to 632m shares from 561m. Overseas investors pursued
large-capital stocks, which have been lagging behind the index; dealers and
arbitrageurs were also buyers. However, some traders said the substantial
volume reflected large-lot arbitrage and dealer activity and did not show
real demand.
The Topix index of all first section stocks put on 10.33 at 1,653.27 and the
Nikkei 300 added 1.72 at 304.03. Advances led declines by 747 to 289, with
153 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index gained 4.22 at
1,369.76.
Steel companies were higher on foreign buying. Kawasaki Steel, the most
active issue of the day, firmed Y10 to Y373.
Chemical and textile shares were perceived as laggards. Mitsubishi Kasei
advanced Y27 to Y490, Sumitomo Chemical Y21 to Y489 and Kurabo Industries
Y16 to Y432.
Toshiba gained Y7 at Y802 on prospects of firm earnings. Sales are expected
to rise in the current year to the end of this month, for the first time in
three years; profits are expected to increase for the first time in five
years in 1994/95.
However, corporate profit-taking depressed a few consumer electronics
stocks. Matsushita Electric Industrial slipped Y30 to Y1,810 and Victor Y50
to Y1,530.
Some financials lost ground on profit-taking. Nomura Securities declined Y20
to Y2,370 and Daiwa Securities Y20 to Y1,740. Daiwa Bank retreated Y40 to
Y1,000.
In Osaka, the OSE average was 149.56 higher at 22,587.94 in volume of 145.5m
shares. The index gained for the fifth consecutive day on buying by foreign
investors.
Roundup
Regional markets put in mixed performances. Kuala Lumpur, Jakarta and
Karachi remained on holiday.
HONG KONG fell 1.5 per cent after a rally in the opening minutes, sparked by
rises in Hong Kong shares listed in London overnight and positive US
economic data, was swiftly reversed.
The Hang Seng index closed 142.95 down at 9,720.61, having been 101 points
ahead in early trade. Turnover was a provisional HKDollars 3.48bn.
HSBC Holdings, the day's most active stock in turnover of HKDollars 215.4m,
finished HKDollars 1 lower at HKDollars 99.
MANILA recovered from an early fall following PLDT's drop on Wall Street,
prompting the view that the market was ready to test higher ground.
The composite index gained 9.44 at 2,642.90 as PLDT lost 25 pesos at 1,890
pesos.
TAIWAN gained ground, boosted by persistent buying of blue chip electronics
issues by some new local trust funds. The weighted index moved up 57.10, or
1.1 per cent, to 5,331.34 in thin turnover of TDollars 38.04bn.
Among the electronics groups, Acer, also helped by last week's court verdict
in a patent dispute, appreciated TDollars 2 to TDollars 53.50.
AUSTRALIA finished in positive territory, in spite of some late selling. The
market drew encouragement from a rally in bonds, which followed the release
of local economic growth figures and modest US inflation data.
The All Ordinaries index ended 1.0 up at 2,173.5 after an intraday high of
2,182.8.
SEOUL saw persistent consolidation in blue chips, although there was growing
interest for low-priced shares. The composite stock index finished 4.90 off
at 906.53.
Bank shares, however, were generally higher on institutional support and
expectations that a number of banks were planning rights issues. Commercial
Bank of Korea, which topped the actives list with 2.33m shares traded, rose
Won290 to Won8,600.
SINGAPORE was easier in spite of a rebound in Malaysian shares traded over
the counter. The Straits Times Industrial index shed 4.14 to 2,185.81.
BOMBAY closed stronger, but few deals were done as the ban on forward
trading reduced liquidity in the market. The BSE index advanced 33.68 to
3,791.96.
COLOMBO was easier again as the market continued its decline after the 40
per cent rise in the first two months of the year. The all-share index lost
27.59 at 1,240.79.

FT  17 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses unsettled, unable to
sustain recent rally
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Germany trimmed repo rates again, the US CPI data was regarded as
encouraging, and there was a Bundesbank meeting today to anticipate.
However, bourses were unsettled by Tuesday's setback for the US equity
market, and were unable to sustain their recent rally, writes Our Markets
Staff.
FRANKFURT ran out of steam after the Dax index, at its intraday high of
2,188.10, registered a near 10 per cent gain over its March 2 midsession low
of 1,992.70. The key index closed at 2,172.73, down 6.18 from Tuesday's
post-bourse close, and eased further to 2,168.11 in the afternoon.
Turnover rose from DM9.5bn to DM9.7bn. Some financials initially resisted
the change in tack amid reasoning that the Bundesbank's easing of its lowest
accepted repo rate from 5.94 to 5.88 per cent, while disappointing the
optimists, was at least another move in the right direction.
However, while the session saw gains in the big banks - Bayernhypo by DM8.20
to DM464.20, Deutsche by DM7.10 to DM824.50 and Dresdner by DM8.80 to
DM415.80 - all three were trimmed back later.
The most noticeable pressures were on former front line cyclicals, with a
number of automotive stocks and chemicals stocks showing weakness throughout
the day. Volkswagen stood out with a fall of DM13.70 to DM481.50 by the end
of the post bourse.
PARIS fell back in the absence of major news, and the CAC-40 index, which
had seen a day's high of 2,256, closed off 15.81 at 2,242.71.
Turnover dropped from FFr5bn to FFr3.5bn, reflecting the easier tone of
trading.
Legrand was one of the day's better performers, putting on FFr70 to
FFr6,070. Goldman Sachs, initiating coverage of the electrical equipment
maker, recommended the stock as a long-term outperformer, based on earnings
growth arising from steady volume growth and market share gains, while price
increases coupled with productivity gains would lead to an improvement in
margins.
'In the past, on a cyclical upturn, margins have been squeezed by sharply
rising raw material costs. However, this time we believe the impact of
rising raw material costs will be more restrained and this is one reason why
above average earnings is sustainable in the longer term.'
AMSTERDAM drifted slightly lower, the AEX index losing 2.03, or 0.5 per cent
at 425.24.
Fokker, the aircraft manufacturer, dropped by some 15 per cent at one stage,
before finding a measure of support to close Fl 1.90 or nearly 12 per cent
down at Fl 14.50. The selling was prompted by a report, denied by the
company, that it was to lower the nominal value of the shares.
Last week the group, in which Daimler of Germany holds a majority stake,
announced a bigger than expected loss for 1993. James Capel, which maintains
a sell recommendation on the stock, commented earlier this week that with a
further substantial loss expected in 1994 another capital injection is
likely.
On a more positive note Van Ommeren, the transport and tanker group,
advanced Fl 1.10 to Fl 50.60 as it forecast improved trading condition this
year.
Grolsch, the brewer, put on 70 cents to Fl 49.70 after reporting flat 1993
results and indicating an improvement in 1994.
MILAN turned lower in technically inspired trading on the last day of the
the March account as investors prepared themselves for what could be a
restrained patch in the run up to the March 27-28 general elections. The
Comit index fell 1.31 to 676.75.
Telecommunications stocks retreated after recent strong gains. Sip fell L93
to L4,506, Stet L80 to L4,935 and Italcable L420 to L10,752.
Short covering helped some industrials higher. Montedison rose L36 to L1,247
and Pirelli L48 to L2,302. Olivetti added L68 to L2,578 on further
speculation about the prospects of its winning the licence to operate
Italy's second mobile telephone licence.
Among the banks, BCI dipped L90 to L6,247 on the last trading day before its
privatisation share makes its debut on the bourse.
ZURICH took its lead from weaker bonds and the SMI index fell 19.8 to
2,887.1.
Roche certificates remained at the top of the active list, giving up SFr40
to SFr7,150.
Profit-taking left cyclical issues lower after their recent strong
performance. Brown Boveri lost SFr14 to SFr1,220 and Sulzer fell SFr23 to
SFr1,045.
MADRID followed the herd, the general index losing 3.06 at 340.17 with
profit-taking most obvious in the US-quoted stocks which lifted the market
on Monday.
Turnover was slightly down at Pta30.3bn. Telefonica and Repsol were the most
active stocks, losing Pta40 to Pta1,925 and Pta110 to Pta4,790 respectively;
in utilities, Endesa dropped Pta160 to Pta7,430.
OSLO was helped higher by lower interest rates and a strong rebound in Norsk
Skog, the forestry group. The all-share index rose 6.12 to 671.52 in
turnover of NKr863m.
Norsk Skog rose NKr15 to NKr185, more than recouping Tuesday's NKr14 fall
which followed an announcement that the company was planning share issues to
raise up to NKr800m.
ISTANBUL rose 4.25 per cent following a rally at midsession as the overnight
borrowing rate was cut from 700 per cent to 200 per cent. The composite
index added 616.12 to 15,127.3.
TEL AVIV rose for the second consecutive session although turnover remained

FT  17 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets: Emerging markets remain weak
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The world's emerging markets continued a general retrenchment last week,
although there were some individual exceptions, according to data supplied
by the IFC.
All the regional indices declined in dollar terms, Latin America by 1.4 per
cent, Asia by 2.2 per cent and Europe/Mideast by 4.3 per cent.
Mr Michael Hughes of BZW in London says that while the emerging markets
bubble has not burst, there has been a clear change in attitude by
investors. 'There has been an adjustment in tactics, rather than strategy,'
he maintains.
Investors have been looking at economic recovery in the G7 nations and
switching funds accordingly.
BZW has been neutral on emerging markets in general since December -
although it still likes Korea as a story.
The IFC is postponing 'for an indefinite' period the entry of the China
index to the composite and Asia indices, which had been planned for April 1.
Explaining the decision the IFC said that there were difficulties in
'ensuring that cash dividends and cor-porate actions by Chinese companies
are properly recorded in a timely fashion'.
The IFC also said that it was increasing the market capitalisation of the
Taiwan index constituents by Dollars 2.5bn from March 18, to reflect the
greater openness of the market to foreign investors.

FT  17 MAR 94 / Markets Report: Sales data knock pound
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hopes for an early UK interest rate cut received a boost yesterday from the
release of weaker than anticipated retail sales figures which added to
doubts about the strength of the UK economic recovery, writes Philip Gawith.
February retail sales fell by 0.5 per cent, compared to the 0.2 per cent
growth expected in the market. Sterling finished the day weaker as a result,
closing in London at DM2.5227, from DM2.53 on Tuesday.
Across the Atlantic, a 0.3 per cent rise in February consumer prices, in
line with market expectations, dampened hopes of a tightening in US monetary
policy this week. The dollar, trading at DM1.6970 before the figures, lost
0.6 pfennig to close at DM1.6910. It finished in New York at DM1.6890.
In Germany, meanwhile, the Bundesbank cut the repo rate by 6 basis points at
its weekly tender  - also in line with market forecasts, but double the
three basis points of each of the last two cuts.
Like the curate's egg, UK economic releases were good in parts. Countering
the retail sales number, which hinted at an economic slowdown, was the
38,000 drop in February unemployment, considerably more robust than the
general expectation of a 15,000 fall.
The market focused on retail sales and sold sterling. This downward move was
helped by the weaker dollar, with the pound unable to rise past the Dollars
1.50/51 level against the US currency. Mr Jeremy Hawkins, senior economic
adviser at Bank of America, said the figures had 'increased the prospect of
a Bank of England rate cut, irrespective of what the Bundesbank does
(today)'.
Following the controversy of the previous rate cut  - on February 8  - he
predicted that the Bank would 'be very keen to make sure it has the economic
justification this time'. The general view is that if the retail prices
number next week is low, then this will open the way for another 25
basis-point reduction.
The data were positively received in the sterling futures market, the June
contract rising four basis points to 94.86. The December contract was eight
points higher at 94.52, while the longer contracts for March and September
1995 were up by 14 to 15 points.
Dealers said speculation about a rate cut would continue to weigh on
sterling, where sentiment is anyway depressed. Mr Stuart Frost, technical
analyst at Natwest Treasury, said dealers saw repeated sterling resistance
at the Dollars 1.50/51 level as an opportunity to make money.
The pound has also been hitting a ceiling at DM2.53 against the D-Mark. Mr
Frost predicts that if it falls through the 'key technical level' of DM2.52,
technical dealers will sell the currency.
Liquidity conditions in the UK discount market were again fairly tight, with
overnight rates rising to a high of 9 per cent in mid-afternoon. This
followed the market realisation that the Bank of England was not going to
offer a repo. After revising the estimated shortage to Pounds 950m, the Bank
purchased Pounds 127m of bills outright before offering Pounds 630m of late
assistance.
Following the fairly subdued producer price data on Tuesday, the dollar
drifted lower yesterday when consumer inflation came in line with the market
forecast. The February consumer price index (CPI) and the 'core' rate, which
excludes food and energy, both rose 0.3 per cent.
Mr Hawkins said the market's reaction had been predictable, with some buying
of the dollar before the lunchtime data release, and light profit-taking
afterwards. He said the general consensus was that although the next policy
tightening from the US Federal Reserve was just a matter of time, it would
probably now only come through next week.
The caveat to this scenario is the release today of the Philadelphia Fed
survey. Last month the Fed tightened policy when the Philadelphia report
showed inflation pressures after a good set of core inflation figures.
The dollar fell back against the yen, closing at Y105.75 from Y106.15. But
in New York it ended at Y106.055. Although the US currency has been firmer
recently, analysts said renewed weakness probably flowed from the combative
stance taken earlier this week by Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade secretary.
This showed that while the Motorola dispute might have been settled, the
broader trade dispute between the two countries remained very much alive.
The D-Mark was barely changed in Europe after the Bundesbank repo cut. It
closed at FFr3.399 from FFr3.398 and at L987.5 from L985.4.
Although the repo cut was broadly in line with expectations, it disappointed
the futures market, and the three-month Euromark contract was three basis
points lower at 94.57 yesterday evening. The December contract was unchanged
at 95.04.
Mr Nick Parsons, chief economist at CIBC, said the repo cut was 'very
encouraging'. He said if the Bundesbank continued to cut at the current rate
 -12 basis points in the past two weeks - the discount rate could fall to
3.25 per cent by next year from 5.25 per cent.

FT  17 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Nigeria warned cash crisis may
hit oil output
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ADAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LAGOS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Multinational oil companies in Nigeria foresee a decline in the industry
unless the government can raise its investment in production and exploration
over the coming year.
The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation owns 60 per cent of the joint
ventures with the multinationals, but has failed to maintain its share of
the operating costs, which average about Dollars 150m a month, and was up to
five months in arrears by last month.
The Nigerian government says it has cut the arrears owed to its partners to
Dollars 350m but the multinationals put the figure at close to Dollars 500m.
The government figure is based on arrears dating back to the start of 1993,
but some of the debts go back to at least 1991.
The government and the oil companies also differ on the investment needed to
maintain current levels of output. The government budgeted for Dollars
3.13bn total investment in 1994 but wants to cut this to Dollars 2.2bn and
has asked the oil companies to reduce this year's operating budgets.
Mr Don Etiebet, the oil minister, is trying to secure as much government
investment as possible for the industry but faces competing claims from
other ministries, which argue that NNPC's share of the budget is too large
and want to spend the money on other projects.
Mr Etiebet recently told the oil companies that selective cuts in
exploration and some operating costs would not reduce production capacity.
The oil majors acknowledge that some reduction is made necessary by the
government's lack of cash and the drop in the oil price but warn that a
Dollars 900m cut in the budget will bring down production capacity next
year.
'By next year it will have a substantial impact on production and the
operations cannot just gear up quickly after such a sharp cut,' according to
an industry expert in Lagos. '"The first thing that we will cut is
exploration,' said one oil company executive. 'We are also postponing some
new projects for a year or so. If that does not produce enough savings we
will have to reduce maintenance.'
Nigeria's oil fields contain lots of small reservoirs and new which last a
short time before a new well is needed. The oil companies are already
reducing their drilling programmes, as it costs at least Dollars 7m to drill
a new well. The drilling contractors and other oil service companies have
been the first to feel the effects of the recession in Nigeria's oil
industry.
'We plan to stop drilling any more wells by August,' said an executive at
one of the multinationals yesterday. 'If that happens across the board some
of the contractors are going to pack up and leave Nigeria, putting a lot of
Nigerians in the oil producing areas out of work.'
The government has ruled out divestment of its equity as a solution to the
cash crisis, but risks a cut in its Organisation of Petroleum Exporting
Countries quota if it allows its production capacity to drop. Mr Etiebet
recently argued for a cut in Opec's production to boost the oil prices but
Nigeria is keen to increase its quota when the market picks up.
The government denies that it is exceeding its Opec crude oil quota of
1.865m barrels a day, which it claims is supplemented by 175,000 b/d of
condensate from the Mobil Oso plant.
Last year Nigeria was aiming to boost its 2.3m b/d capacity to 2.5m by 1995,
but oil companies warn that it could drop well below 2m by next year.

FT  17 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: US calls for proof that its
stockpile sales are disrupting the world bauxite market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US government will limit sales of refractory grade bauxite (aluminium
ore) sold from its strategic stockpile in the 1994 fiscal year to Chinese
material, but has asked for evidence from a major producer to substantiate
claims that the sales are depressing prices paid to producers.
The US embassy in Guyana says the limit is in response to concerns expressed
by the Guyanese government over the sale of 48,000 tonnes of refractory
grade bauxite between October 1992 and September 1993.
Guyana and China dominate the world market for refractory grade bauxite. The
government of the English-speaking republic in north-east South America says
the sale is depressing the world market price of the bauxite and threatening
efforts to rehabilitate the local bauxite industry.
'In response to Guyanese government concerns about the impact of stockpile
refractory bauxite sales on the Guyanese market. . . the stockpile has taken
affirmative action to limit refractory bauxite offerings in fiscal year 1994
primarily to Chinese material,' an embassy statement says. It adds, however,
that the US interagency committee, which monitors the impact of stockpile
sales, has asked the Guyana government to provide additional information to
support its contention that the US sales have caused undue disruption in the
market.
'This committee did not believe that the bauxite sales in fiscal year 1993
would cause an undue disruption of the world market for refractory bauxite,
which amounts to over 1m tons annually,' it says. Guyanese officials had
claimed that the sale from the US strategic stockpile had driven world
prices for refractory grade bauxite from Dollars 150 a tonne to under
Dollars 100.
The US Congress has directed the Defence Stockpile Centre to sell its
surplus stock of refractory bauxite by September 1997 because stockpiling
requirements have changed because of a lessening in potential threats to US
national security.
The decision to reduce the strategic bauxite stockpile has been a cause of
concern among producers.
Mr Nenad Altman, secretary general of the International Bauxite Association,
the producers' group, said recently that despite the sale of relatively
small amounts, producers were being affected by the price of the US
material.

FT  17 MAR 94 / World Commodities Prices: Copper leads metal rally - Market
Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After hours 'kerb' trading was active at the London Metal Exchange yesterday
today with a strong COPPER market, which ended at 7 1/2 -month peaks,
pulling other metals higher. Dealers thought further gains were likely in
the short term.
ALUMINIUM was bolstered by heavy late buying, and broke through the Dollars
1,320-a-tonne level for three months delivery, where sizeable stop-loss
buying orders were triggered.
The LEAD and ZINC markets broadly took their cue from the overall trend in
base metals, as there were no particular fundamental factors evident to
justify strength at present, notably in zinc, dealers said.
COFFEE and COCOA futures ended lower at the London Commodity Exchange in a
mild correction to recent rallies, though traders said underlying sentiment
in both markets remained positive.
After a brief attempt to break through the high at Dollars 1,325, May coffee
slipped back to end Dollars 7 lower at Dollars 1,310. But its ability to
keep above Dollars 1,300 throughout the day led traders to believe the
current uptrend was still intact.
After a weak start cocoa failed to build up any momentum, staying in the
minus column all day. The May position finished Pounds 3 down at Pounds 966
a tonne, Pounds 1 below the day's high. 'We've seen a lot of players taking
profits,' said one trader.

Russia is to allow private buyers to bid for diamonds in an open tender,
reports Reuter from Moscow, but a senior official said the auction would not
breach a marketing deal with De Beers' Central Selling Organisation, which
controls the vast bulk of the world diamond market.
Mr Pavel Kovylin, head of the Almazexport branch of Russia's Diamonds of
Russia-Sakha producers, declined to say how many carats of diamonds would be
offered for sale. But he said trade reports that Russia would sell 100,000
carats were 'a big exaggeration'.
'We will hold a tender soon, observing all our obligations to the CSO,' he
said, 'and the volume will be much smaller than that.'

FT  17 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: The glittering prize that was
almost overlooked - Kenneth Gooding talks to the British-born lady geologist
who in 1972 found Australia's first diamond
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Companies scrambling to take part in Australia's biggest diamond exploration
boom for many years owe a great debt to Ms Maureen Muggeridge.
This British-born geologist earned a place in geological history when she
found Australia's first diamond in 1972 - before that many experts believed
there were no diamonds to be found in the country, despite its huge size,
because the geology was wrong.
She was also part of the team that seven years later located the Argyle AK1
deposit in the far north of Western Australia, one of the country's most
important mineral discoveries and now the world's largest diamond producer,
at least in terms of the weight.
Ms Muggeridge, now 46, was born in Croydon, near London, and is the niece of
the late Mr Malcolm Muggeridge, the eccentric British writer. She spent her
childhood in Nigeria and earned her geology degree at St Andrew's
University, Glasgow. She recalls she then set out for Australia 'to get some
sunshine unquote'.
She was given a job by Tanganyika Holdings, which then was the only company
seriously exploring for diamonds in Australia, apart from, inevitably, De
Beers, the South African group which dominates the industry, via its
subsidiary Stockdale. Tanganyika was eventually absorbed by CRA, one of
Australia's big mining groups and one capable of finding the large sums
required to finance a diamond mine.
Ms Muggeridge recalls that the vital clues to the massive Argyle deposit
were nearly missed. 'I was a bit pushy and insisted we leave no gaps in the
exploration work.' So with only one geologist assistant she set out in a
helicopter on what proved to be an immensely profitable sortie for CRA. One
consolation was that her assistant on that trip was Mr John Towie, now a
director of rival Australian diamond exploration group, Triad Minerals, whom
she had then just wed.
The 38 diamond grains in the sample they sent back for testing could have
fitted easily on the head of a match. Once those traces had been found,
however, it was an easy task to trace them back to the Argyle deposit.
'Searching for diamonds is much worse than looking for a needle in a
haystack,' says Ms Muggeridge. 'At least you can burn down the haystack and
use a metal detector. Success in diamond exploration depends heavily on the
expertise of the people involved and, because diamonds and their host rocks
are so rare, they are extremely hard to find and a long term approach is an
absolute necessity.'
For the past five years she has been exploration director of Moonstone
Diamond Corporation, which last November raised ADollars 5m (USDollars 3.6m)
on the Australian Stock Exchange, enough for two year's exploration work.
Ms Muggeridge was among the speakers at the first Australian Diamond
Conference here in Perth last week.
The standing room only event was one indication of how diamond fever has
taken hold in Western Australia. Another came from Mr Michael Thomson of
stockbrokers Eyres Reed when he estimated that in the past year diamond
exploration companies in Australia had raised at least ADollars 72m.
As usual in mining booms, many of the companies involved are as interested
in bulling up their share prices as in looking for gem stones. This has led
to some unease and complaints, particularly about the way some report their
exploration results - so far no set procedures have been fixed for this.
At the conference Mr Wolf Marx, convener of the diamond reporting committee
of the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, read from a number
of recent explorers' reports that left out crucial information such as the
value of diamonds found or referred to values or even connotations of value
(such as 'gem' or 'near gem') of a small number of diamonds that were
potentially misleading.
'Diamond exploration geologists, exploration managers and even chairmen of
mining companies are unlikely to have sufficient expertise to give accurate
assessments of diamond values,' he explained. 'This is made worse if the
stones are micro diamonds which, by definition, cannot be considered to have
any value other than scientific.'
Delegates cheered up, however, when Mr Chris Jennings, an international
explorer associated with the discoveries in the North West Territories that
caused Canada's recent diamond rush, said new technical expertise and
knowledge justified more exploration in Australia, including in those areas
already studied for diamonds. 'Since Argyle there has been no intense
exploration in Australia,' he said. 'There are probably big areas where
there is some sort of potential for diamonds - I feel confident about it.'
Nevertheless, finding those diamonds will not be easy. Mr Yannic Mercier,
Geneva-based chairman of Ms Muggeridge's Moonstone Corporation, jokingly
told delegates that when he was first invited to invest he replied: 'Setting
up a diamond exploration company raises only two questions; how much money
you want to lose and how long will you give yourself to lose it'.

FT  17 MAR 94 / Government Bonds: Bundesbank gives brief boost to European
paper
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN and FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
European government bonds had a volatile session, rising in the morning
following the latest reduction in the Bundesbank's repo rate but slipping
back towards the close amid scant retail demand and reports of overseas
selling.
'Investors see value in these markets, but no one wants to be the first to
buy,' said Mr Garry Jones, senior strategist at Paribas Capital Markets. He
said that 'some people are starting to nibble at the market', buying on dips
rather than selling into strength.
UK gilts were Europe's weakest market yesterday, shrugging off
lower-than-expected retail sales numbers and falling by more than a point as
January average-earnings and unit labour cost data reignited inflation
concerns. The June long gilt future on Liffe fell by around 1 3/32 point to
110 15/16 .
Gilts sharply underperformed their core European counterparts, causing their
10-year yield premium over German bunds to widen to about 115 basis points
on an annualised basis from 105 basis points at the open.
Friday's expected announcement by the Bank of England of its next gilt
auction exerted further pressure on prices.
'In the absence of overseas investors, new supply will have to be taken up
by domestics  - who have been keeping a very low profile in recent weeks,'
said a trader.
German bunds strengthened in the morning, despite some disappointment that
the Bundesbank shaved only six basis points off its minimum repo rate,
bringing it down to 5.88 per cent.
However, the drop was larger than the recent three-basis-point reductions,
serving as a reminder that the German monetary easing process continues.
According to Mr Carl Holt, head of trading at ABN-Amro, 'the market got a
bit over-extended in recent days', and slipped back yesterday amid scant
retail activity. He did see some investor interest in shorter maturities,
which are seen to benefit from further cuts in short-term rates, but 'people
are cautious towards the long end', he said.
Looking to today's Bundesbank council meeting, few traders expect a cut in
the 5.25 per cent discount rate, although there was continued talk of a
reduction in the 6.25 per cent Lombard rate. Until the next meeting on April
14, most traders expect the Bundesbank to continue its policy of cautious
repo-rate cuts.
The Dutch government today will reopen its 7 1/2 per cent 30-year benchmark
bond at an auction that is expected to raise between Fl 1bn and Fl 2bn.
US bond prices posted solid gains as more favourable news on inflation
brought a wave of relief to the hard-pressed Treasuries market.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  25/32 better
at 92 29/32 , with the yield falling to 6.806 per cent. On the short end,
the two-year note was up  3/32 to 99 15/32 , to yield 4.895 per cent.
For the second day running the Labor Department eased concerns over
inflationary pressures, which represent a threat to the value of fixed-rate
Treasury bonds. The government said the February consumer price index had
risen 0.3 per cent, matching the consensus forecast of analysts. On an
annual basis, the index fell to 2.4 per cent, its lowest level for seven
years.
It was the last big hurdle facing the market this week. The absence of any
unpleasant surprises was enough to allow bonds to extend gains struck the
previous session. However, buying continued to be subdued during the
morning. Some observers believed prices would remain in a narrow range until
after the Federal Reserve's policy-making session next week.
The prices data, while confirming that inflation was still under control,
failed to shake the consensus that the Fed was poised to lift its target for
short-term interest rates soon after the March 22 meeting.
Despite such misgivings, prices began to rise again in the final hours of
trading and reached the session highs by the close. The steady climb
suggested to Mr John Donnelly, chief market strategist at Technical Data in
Boston, the recent correction in bond prices could be drawing to an end.

FT  17 MAR 94 / International Bonds: Philips returns to market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Philips, the Dutch electronics group which this month announced a return to
profit in 1993 and its first dividend since 1990, returned to the
international bond market yesterday after an absence of six years with a
FFr1bn offering of eight-year Eurobonds.
A Philips spokesman said the proceeds of the transaction would be kept in
French francs and used for general corporate purposes. He added that Philips
had chosen to make its return in the French franc sector because it was the
most receptive to long maturities from corporate borrowers.
Syndicate managers said Philips' bonds were correctly priced at a yield
spread of 85 basis points over the 8 1/2 per cent French government bond due
2002, and that the spread met current demand among investors for decent
returns. They added that a further attraction was the likelihood that
Philips' fortunes would continue to improve.
Lead manager CCF said domestic investors took up around half of the bonds
which it sold yesterday, while the other half were sold to investors in
Germany, Benelux and Switzerland.
When the bonds were freed to trade, they slipped from a fixed re-offer price
of 99.55 to 99.20, in line with weakness in the underlying market. The
spread widened by one basis point.
Elsewhere, New Zealand's successful issue of floating-rate notes on Tuesday
prompted two further five-year FRN offerings, one of Dollars 500m from
Hydro-Quebec and the other of Dollars 150m from Instituto Nacional de
Industria (INI), the Spanish state industrial holding company.
The tighter pricing on INI's offering, which was off its Euro medium-term
note programme, reflected its superior credit rating. Some syndicate
managers feared that the FRN market was close to saturation following the
recent rush of offerings.
The World Bank followed the European Investment Bank's footsteps into the
Greek drachma sector yesterday when it launched a Dr15bn offering of
three-year Eurobonds. The proceeds of the transaction were swapped into
dollars. The World Bank said the deal reflected its policy of constantly
trying to diversify its funding sources and investor groups. In addition,
the bank had achieved an attractive cost of funds on an after-swap basis.
Lead manager Midland Bank Athens said the high coupon on the bonds of 15 1/2
per cent appealed mainly to continental investors. When the bonds were freed
to trade, they rose from an issue price of 100 7/8 to 103 1/4 .
Bank for Dutch Municipalities took advantage of demand among Benelux retail
investors for short-dated Canadian dollar bonds by issuing a CDollars 150m
offering of three-year Eurobonds. Lead manager ABN-Amro said it had sold
over half of its commitment, around one-third of the total amount, by the
close of trading. The bonds closed unchanged at their fixed re-offer price
of 99.86.

Grupo Financiero GBM Atlantico, one of Mexico's regional banks, is hoping to

priced today.
GBM-Atlantico is issuing 22m 'L' shares, with 45 per cent to be offered to
US investors in the form of American Depositary Shares, 30 per cent to
international investors in the form of Global Depositary Shares, and 25 per
cent issued to domestic investors.
The shares will be priced at close of trade in Mexico today, although some
market participants point out that the issue is taking place against a
difficult background.
'The Mexican stock market has been relatively weak over the last month, and
investors are concerned about the currency and the general political
background,' said one investment banker.
He added that the kidnapping of a prominent Mexican banker earlier this week
has not helped investor sentiment.

The London and Shanghai stock exchanges yesterday agreed to work towards the
listing of Chinese companies abroad as part of increased co-operation
between the two markets.
Sir Andrew Hugh Smith, chairman of the London stock exchange, signed a
memorandum of understanding with his Shanghai counterpart aimed at
facilitating technical contacts.
Sir Andrew said that these contacts would assist in bringing closer the
regulatory procedures of the two exchanges.
Among issues being discussed was the trading of Shanghai stocks on the
London market. Shanghai Petrochemical, which was listed abroad
simultaneously in Hong Kong and New York last year, is being traded in
London.
Sir Andrew, who has been addressing seminars in Beijing and Shanghai
organised by the China-Britain Trade Group, said that he could foresee
British companies seeking listings in Shanghai. The timing would depend, he
said, on further de-regulation of the foreign exchange market. China has not
yet moved to full convertibility for the yuan.
Shanghai is one of two stock exchanges in China. The other is located in the
Shenzen Special Economic Zone adjacent to Hong Kong. There are plans for a
third, possibly in the Yangtze river town of Wuhan.

rescue scheme
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A potential obstacle for the rescue plan being mounted for Banco Espanol de
Credito (Banesto) was removed yesterday when J. P. Morgan of the US
confirmed it would support the scheme at a shareholders' meeting on March
26.
The restructuring plan drawn up by the Bank of Spain means that the 7.9 per
cent stake held by J. P. Morgan-managed Corsair Fund, the largest single
shareholding in the bank, will be diluted to 4.5 per cent as a result of the
writing down of the nominal share value from Pta700 to Pta400.
J. P. Morgan advised the former Banesto chairman Mr Mario Conde, who was
dismissed by the Bank of Spain in December after inspectors found the bank
had greatly over-valued its assets. Auditors have calculated the 'hole' in
Banesto's balance sheet at Pta605bn (Dollars 4.36bn).
The US bank said it had not yet decided whether to make a further investment
in Banesto following the capitalisation plan in order to restore the size of
its holding.

<TEXT>
Codan, which last year became Denmark's largest general insurance company
with the takeover of Hafnia, made a net profit of DKr815m (Dollars 125.4m)
in 1993, compared with a DKr74m loss in 1992.
Hafnia collapsed in 1992 after an unsuccessful attempt, with Norway's Uni
Storebrand, to mount a bid for Skandia, the Swedish insurance group. Codan
is controlled by the UK's Sun Alliance.
The Hafnia acquisition is reflected by a rise in Codan's premium income,
from DKr2.09bn to DKr6.95bn last year. The figure includes both general
insurance and life assurance. The group's total assets rose to DKr55.34bn
from DKr15.32bn.
Codan said the overall result for 1993 was acceptable, but that the result
for general insurance was 'unsatisfactory'.

Ciments Francais, the French cement and building materials company,
yesterday announced a halving in net losses in 1993, to FFr685m (Dollars
119m) from FFr1.31bn.
Mr Rene-Yves Nanot, the chairman, said many of the group's markets had
improved, but he cautioned against predictions of a strong recovery in the
current year. 'I am not sure that this year will see a strong rebound,' he
said.
The reduction in the company's deficit was achieved on sales of FFr13.46bn,
compared with FFr14.9bn in 1992.
A large part of the decline in sales, according to a spokesman for the
group, was attributable to the depressed conditions in the French market and
also to weak demand in Belgium.
Operating profits fell more sharply than sales, declining to FFr1.05bn from
FFr1.35bn. Exceptional losses were reduced to FFr335m from FFr1.13bn in
1992, however, explaining the improvement at the level of net results.
According to the company, its strategy of selling non-core assets had
allowed it to reduce debts by more than FFr700m to about FFr8bn. It said
that further asset sales could be expected this year.

Telstra, the Australian telecommunications company, yesterday reported a
26.3 per cent increase in profits after tax, to ADollars 997m (USDollars
717.3m) for the six months ended December. However, it warned that
increasing competition would put pressure on future returns.
Mr David Hoare, chairman, described the first-half results as sound but said
that competition had been fierce. 'This will increase pressure on Telstra's
future profit margins and cashflows,' he said.
Due to the progressive deregulation of the Australian telecommunications
sector, Telstra now faces competition from Optus in the long-distance
market, and from Optus and Britain's Vodafone for mobile telephone services.
The government's aim is to move to full network competition by 1997.
Revenues for the six months rose 3.5 per cent to ADollars 6.41bn and
operating profits were 12.2 per cent higher at ADollars 1.48m.
Telstra's debt fell, leaving the gearing ratio at 37 per cent by the end of
1993, compared with 41 per cent six months earlier.
The company is to pay an interim dividend of ADollars 361m to the federal
government. It does not give a detailed break-down of its figures.

Groupe Victoire, the insurance unit of France's Cie de Suez, yesterday
announced a FFr3.53bn (Dollars 612m) group net profit for 1993, up from
FFr214m in 1992, Agencies reports from Paris.
However, excluding exceptional items, net profit dipped to FFr1bn from
FFr1.2bn.
Last year's accounts were distorted by Victoire's sale of most of its
foreign operations to Union des Assurances de Paris, which added a capital
gain of FFr3bn.
This was partly offset by about FFr500m of exceptional losses linked to
Victoire's stake in Gefion, formerly Baltica of Denmark, and a financial
operation in Canada.
Mr Patrick Werner, director-general of Victoire, quashed rumours that it was
being sold. He said the executive board, which met yesterday, did not
discuss this possibility, and 'it won't be on the agenda of the Suez board',
which meets on April 5.

FT  17 MAR 94 / International Company News: Porsche details fund-raising
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The planned capital increase for Porsche, aimed at raising DM200m (Dollars
118m) to help fund new sports car developments, is to take the form of a
one-for-four rights issue at DM575 a share.
The subscription period for the 350,000 new shares, half ordinary and half
preferred stock with a nominal value of DM17.5m, will run from March 22 to
April 7. The new shares will be eligible for 50 per cent of any dividend
payable for the financial year ending on July 31. The offer follows approval
at the annual meeting in January of a proposal to increase the company's
capital by up to DM20m.
The new ordinary stock is already destined for the Porsche and Piech
families, which own all existing voting shares, and have shown no
inclination to relinquish absolute control. They are also understood to own
40 per cent of outstanding preference shares.
The company, which last year lost almost DM240m, and has previously said it
expects a further deficit this year of around DM150m, after a shortfall of
DM115m at the half-year, has confidently forecast a return to profits in
1994/95 and 'decent' earnings the following year.
By then it expects to have two new models on the market to bolster a range
which at present depends heavily on the 911 series. The company has
estimated its investment needs at DM1bn until the end of the 1996/97 year.
Further details of the company's prospects are expected on Monday at the
public launch of the rights issue by the lead manager, Dresdner Bank.

FT  17 MAR 94 / International Company News: Being punished for prudence -
Nordbanken's rivals say state aid was unfair
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This time last year, most of Sweden's banks were queueing up for government
aid to rescue them from a loan-loss ducking that nearly sank them. Twelve
months later, the state is under fire from the same banks for weighting its
support too heavily towards just one institution, Nordbanken.
The issue is set to be thrown into sharp relief next week when Nordbanken,
now wholly state-owned, announces profits for 1993. These are likely to be
well in excess of those of its rivals. It is a profit the bank could not
possibly have achieved without a wholesale clean-up of its books last year.
The operation involved an injection of taxpayers' funds of more than SKr50bn
(Dollars 6.4bn), and the assumption by the state of Nordbanken bad loans
worth SKr67bn.
What is more, Nordbanken has meanwhile become the largest Swedish bank, by
market share, through the takeover of Gota Bank. Gota was second only to
Nordbanken in the scale of its loan-loss debacle and also was taken over by
the state. That operation cost more than SKr27bn and involved the state
purchase of bad assets worth SKr43bn.
Nordbanken and Gota Bank were not the only banks to receive state aid.
However, they did swallow the lion's share and the other banks, particularly
Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken and Svenska Handelsbanken, are peeved. The two
are leading commercial banks which survived the crisis without direct state
assistance.
SE-Banken and Handelsbanken both returned to profit in 1993 after huge
losses in 1992 - respectively posting operating earnings of SKr357m and
SKr1.8bn, due mainly to low interest rates and rising investment income. But
they continued to be burdened by high loan losses - as was Swedbank, the
largest in the Nordic region by asset values, and the smaller
Foreningsbanken. Both remained in the red in 1993.
The growing sense of unfair treatment among Nordbanken's rivals was given
its strongest airing earlier this month in a protest from the Swedish
Bankers' Association. Led by SE-Banken and Handelsbanken, the association
complained that the extent of state aid to Nordbanken was excessive, and
called on the government to claw back some of its support.
'The state support for Nordbanken has been comprised in a way that gives
Nordbanken a clear competitive advantage over the other players in the
payment and credit system,' the association said in a letter to the Bank
Support Authority, the Riksbank, and the financial inspectors.
Handelsbanken, in particular, would appear to have grounds for complaint. It
was the least affected by loan losses - mostly accrued by its rivals through
wildly-imprudent property lending - and was the only bank which did not
apply for state aid.
Yet its reward for solid management has been limited to an increase in
market share, from around 14 per cent to 16 per cent and, in the words of a
government official, the enhancement of its 'reputation and standing in the
market'.
The authorities, however, have shown little sympathy for the Bankers'
Association protest. Mr Stefan Ingves, chief executive of the Bank Support
Authority, says allowing Nordbanken and/or Gota Bank to collapse would have
reduced, not enhanced, competition in the system - if, indeed, the system
had survived the shock.
He rejects a proposal by the Bankers' Association that Nordbanken should be
penalised through the suspension of interest payments due on SKr30bn in
assets held by Securum, the so-called bad bank into which the government
placed Nordbanken's bad loans.
Mr Ingves said although Nordbanken was not paying a formal price for Gota,
it would have to spend around SKr3bn to bring Gota's capital adequacy ratio
above the international requirement of 8 per cent. In addition, the BSA
intended to 'disentangle' over the next year both Nordbanken from Securum
and Gota from Retriva, the Gota 'bad bank'.
However, the main concern of the authorities appears to be to achieve the
best payback to the taxpayers when Nordbanken is re-privatised, rather than
to placate the competitive jealousies of other banks.
It was the perception that a merger with Nordbanken would enhance these
returns that led the government not to sell Gota Bank as a stand-alone
entity late last year.
Mr Ingves insists the final reckoning of the government's bail-out of
Nordbanken and Gota Bank should not be made until Nordbanken is sold off,
probably some time next year.

FT  17 MAR 94 / International Company News: Top Danish insurer back in black
at DKr815m
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Codan, which last year became Denmark's largest general insurance company
with the takeover of Hafnia, made a net profit of DKr815m (Dollars 125.4m)
in 1993, compared with a DKr74m loss in 1992.
Hafnia collapsed in 1992 after an unsuccessful attempt, with Norway's Uni
Storebrand, to mount a takeover bid for Skandia, the big Swedish insurance
group. Codan is controlled by the UK's Sun Alliance.
The Hafnia acquisition is reflected by a rise in Codan's premium income,
from DKr2.09bn to DKr6.95bn last year. The figure includes both general
insurance and life assurance. The group's total assets rose to DKr55.34bn
from DKr15.32bn.
Codan said the overall result for 1993 was acceptable, but that the result
for general insurance was 'unsatisfactory'. There was a loss on Danish
general insurance, before investment income from insurance activities, of
DKr770m.
However, rising bond and share prices in 1993 pushed up investment income.
Investment income on the general insurance business amounted to DKr610m.
Other investment income was DKr664m, while the life assurance business made
a profit of DKr428m.
Codan said performance in general insurance would improve in 1994, as
premium prices had been increased and because 1993 was burdened with
non-recurring provisions arising from Hafnia. These included DKr400m to
cover losses on finance guarantees over and above the amount already set
aside by Hafnia.
The final result in 1994 will depend on the movement of bond and share
prices, said Codan. It is paying an unchanged DKr50-a-share dividend for
1993.
RAS, the big Italian insurance group, expects pre-tax profits for last year
to exceed the L94.6bn (Dollars 56m) of 1992, writes John Simpkins from
Milan.

FT  17 MAR 94 / International Company News: Asko returns to profit but opts
to omit payout

<TEXT>
Asko, one of Germany's biggest retailers, returned to profit last year, but
will not resume dividend payments on ordinary shares until the end of this
year.
By then the company should be experiencing a marked improvement in earnings,
Mr Klaus Wiegandt, chairman, said yesterday.
It will, however, pay out around DM1.5bn in the form of a DM7.50 dividend
for preference shareholders, according to Mr Horst Weber, finance director.
The payment comprises DM2.50 for each of the past three years, and meets a
statutory requirement for a minimum 5 per cent annual dividend to holders of
preferred stock.
Preference shareholders would have acquired voting rights at the next annual
meeting if the payment were not made, he said.
The company, majority-owned by the Swiss Metro group since last year, earned
a net DM432m (Dollars 255.6m) for the year ended September, 1993, compared
with a loss of DM462m in the preceding nine-month period.
Last year's profits from ordinary activities, excluding extraordinary gains
and payments resulting from a wide-ranging restructuring, totalled DM196m,
Mr Wiegandt said.
He confirmed that the group would go ahead this year with a rights issue to
reinforce Asko's capital base. The board has approval a nominal DM83.25m
capital increase.
Majority shareholders - Metro, WestLB bank and Begoha-Holding, accounting
for 70 per cent of the outstanding shares - would take up their entitlement
to the rights offer.
The group's ordinary shares gained DM39 yesterday, closing at DM1,089 in
Frankfurt, while the preference stock rose DM25 to DM980.

Pasminco, the Australian zinc and lead producer, is selling a 40 per cent
interest in the Elura zinc/lead mine in New South Wales to Korea Zinc
Company for ADollars 40m (USDollars 28.7m).
The price will be paid in two instalments: ADollars 27m when the deal is
completed, and a further ADollars 13m when the mine is upgraded to allow it
to operate at its 'installed' capacity of 1.2m tonnes of ore a year. It
currently operates at only around 800,000 tonnes a year.
Once back to installed capacity, Pasminco will take 60 per cent of the
output to supply its Australian smelters, while Korea Zinc will use the
remainder to supply zinc and lead smelters in Korea.

Joel, the South African gold mine controlled by Johannesburg Consolidated
Investment, yesterday announced a R284m (Dollars 82m) rights issue and new
mining plan.
Joel will redeem R150m worth of preference shares, and pay for the early
stages of an eight-year R657m revamp of the mine's underground and surface
operations through the issue of 98m new shares at 290 cents each.
JCI, which is part of the Anglo American group, and the Sanlam life
insurance company, holders of 55 per cent and 7 per cent stakes in Joel,
will take up their entitlement to the offer. The balance will be
underwritten by Smith New Court and NM Rothschild.
JCI has sunk R900m into Joel since 1987, but in the past year considered
closing or merging it with the neighbouring Beatrix mine, owned by Gencor.
Joel's results have been dented by high working costs and heavy borrowings.

FT  17 MAR 94 / International Company News: Pemex seeks to borrow Dollars
1.1bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Petroleos Mexicanos is seeking to borrow Dollars 1.1bn from banks around the
world in what amounts to the first big syndicated bank financing for a
Mexican borrower since the country shook the international banking system in
1982 by ceasing to service its foreign debt.
Some foreign banks have already extended large loans to Mexican borrowers
since the country agreed a debt reduction deal with its foreign creditors.
Such deals, however, have been in the form of so-called 'club' transactions,
involving small numbers of banks, and have not involved attempts at
attracting broad support in the bank lending markets.
The Pemex deal, which falls into three parts, will be used in part to
refinance a Dollars 1.5bn trade-related bank credit which dates back to
1979. That facility was not part of the country's debt-reduction plan.
J. P. Morgan has fully underwritten a Dollars 500m, two-year trade-related
facility, while Industrial Bank of Japan is acting as agent to a similar
Dollars 300m deal to be syndicated in Japan. BankAmerica is agent to a
further Dollars 300m, one-year deal to back-up Pemex's commercial paper
programmes.
Banks in some countries are still subject to central bank regulations
requiring them to set aside reserves against earlier loans to Mexico.
However, bankers involved in the Pemex deal said that such regulations would
not prevent banks lending new money.
Pemex, like many other Latin American borrowers, has been active in the
international bond markets for some time, and on Tuesday launched floating
rate note issues to raise Dollars 400m.
The switch to bank finance represented a long-planned move to diversify its
borrowing, rather than a reaction to the mark-down of emerging market
issuers in the fixed-rate bond markets since the US Federal Reserve raised
interest rates in early February, one banker involved in the deal said.

Citicorp, the US's biggest credit card issuer, has handed responsibility for
its US and European cards business to a new executive, marking the latest
senior-level reshuffle in the international credit card industry.
In recent months both Visa and MasterCard have replaced long-serving
chairmen. The moves signal growing competition between banks and other
issuers in the credit card industry, as well as a shift in focus away from
the mature US market.
Citicorp said it had created a new position of head of credit cards for the
US and Europe. Previously, responsibility for credit cards had rested with
regional managers, who had responsibility for all retail banking products.
Citicorp named Ms Roberta Arena as the first head of the cards business,
catapulting her into one of the most prominent positions in the industry.
She is currently general manager of the US cards business, and was
previously in charge of European credit cards.
The bank has been engaged in a largely successful strategy to defend its
market position in the US against new entrants in recent months.
The reshuffle in part indicates an intention to shift emphasis to other
markets with better growth prospects. Citicorp has 29m cardholders in the
US, compared with 600,000 in Europe.
American Express is to concentrate the administration and processing of its
European charge card operations in Brighton in the UK over the next 18
months, resulting in a net loss of 900 jobs. It said the move would speed up
its operations and cut costs.
Visa International said its 1993 worldwide sales volume rose 16.9 per cent
to Dollars 542.2bn, the first time sales have topped Dollars 500bn.

FT  17 MAR 94 / International Company News: Aldus and Adobe set to merge

<TEXT>
Aldus and Adobe Systems, two pioneers of desktop publishing software, are to
merge in a stock swap deal valued at about Dollars 525m. Combined, the
companies have annual revenues of about Dollars 520m.
Adobe will exchange 1.15 shares of its common stock for each share of Aldus
common stock.
Aldus' share price rose sharply yesterday on news of the merger agreement,
trading at Dollars 31 1/8 , up from Tuesday's close of Dollars 26 1/4 .
Adobe Systems was trading at Dollars 28 3/4 , down from Dollars 32 1/2 .
'We believe our two companies, each with a rich history of inventing
different aspects of the electronic publishing revolution, are simply much
stronger together - both technologically and financially,' said Mr John
Warnock, chairman and chief executive of Adobe Systems.
Adobe and Aldus are widely recognised for having created 'desktop
publishing' - the use of personal computers in publishing newsletters,
magazines and newspapers. Over the past decade publishing software has grown
into a Dollars 2bn industry.
Adobe's flagship product is PostScript, a computer language for printers
that has become an industry standard. It also makes programs that allow
computer users to print text in various typefaces.
Based in Mountain View, California, the company reported fiscal 1993
revenues of Dollars 313m and net income of Dollars 57m.
Aldus' leading product is PageMaker, a program for the 'lay out' or design
of documents such as magazine pages. Based in Seattle, Washington, it had
1993 revenues of Dollars 207m and net income of Dollars 9.5m.
The companies' products are complementary, with little overlap, analysts
said. Mr Tim Bajarin, president of Creative Strategies, a California market
research firm, said the deal would allow them 'to be much more of a
powerhouse when it comes to next-generation desktop publishing, printing and
graphics technology'.

<TEXT>
A group of dissatisfied shareholders at US Shoe, an American clothing,
optical and footwear retailer, is to propose at the group's annual meeting
this spring that it be broken into three separately quoted companies.
The suggestion has been submitted by private investors associated with Mr
Alfred Kingsley, who runs Greenway Partners, a New York money management
firm. Mr Kingsley has been trying to raise shareholder support for the
scheme. His firm owns or has voting control over more than 4 per cent of US
Shoe's stock, but has not held it long enough to file a proposal itself.
Mr Kingsley, a former associate of Mr Carl Icahn, the corporate raider,
argues that US Shoe's three divisions lack synergy.
Mr Robert Burton, US Shoe's director of corporate communications, said its
board planned to file a preliminary reply to it within a week.
US Shoe has annual sales of around Dollars 2.7bn. The company has a
lacklustre earnings record and is one of 10 poor performers being targeted
for action during the annual company meeting season by the California Public
Employees Retirement System, one of the largest and most aggressive
investment funds in the US.

European bids

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Several leading European brewers have placed bids for a 24 per cent stake in
Zagreb Brewery (ZB), Croatia's largest brewer with the capacity to produce
up to 1m hectolitres of beer.
The bidders include Interbrew, the Belgian company that makes Stella Artois,
Brau AG of Austria, Castel of France, a German group, and a millionaire
former Croat emigre.
The whole of the company is being privatised with over 50 per cent of the
shares reserved for employees, and the reminder going to pensions and other
funds. A foreign partner was sought to help modernise production.
ZB has a book value of around DM41m (Dollars 23.2m) but the market value as
reflected in the bids is considerably higher, says Mr Peter Golscheider,
managing director of Epic, the Vienna-based investment fund which organised
the foreign tender.
While ZB has mainly a regional market, demand is expected to pick up
strongly when tourists return to Croatia once the war in Bosnia is over.
The winning bid will be announced in a week's time. The brewery has a strong
history of profitability, a low debt, and a good management team, Mr
Golscheider says.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Northwest Airlines, the fourth-largest US carrier, appears to be
substantially cutting the asking price of a public offering of shares
through which it plans to return to the stock market over the next few
weeks.
When Northwest announced its offering in January it indicated that it hoped
to sell the shares at around Dollars 20, raising between Dollars 400m and
Dollars 460m in new capital.
However, Wall Street analysts said yesterday that it appeared now to be
seeking some Dollars 13 to Dollars 14 a share. Northwest declined to
comment, citing securities regulations which preclude discussion of public
offerings.
Lehman Brothers is lead underwriter for the offering, which is expected to
be priced next week.
Analysts said the offering was never going to be a particularly easy one to
sell.
Northwest narrowly escaped bankruptcy last year by persuading employees to
accept an equity stake in return for labour concessions.
It faces a continuing fares war against rival carriers in the depressed
North American market and is one of the leading US airlines serving the
Pacific, where Japan's recession has hit trade.

FT  17 MAR 94 / International Company News: Fund launched to invest in Peru
privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER, Latin America Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A new fund to invest in Peru's radical privatisation programme is to be
launched next month using a format previously successfully in Chile and
Argentina.
Midland Bank of the UK, Chase Manhattan of the US and Banco de Credito del
Peru are sponsoring the fund, expected to attract up to Dollars 250m in cash
and sovereign debt paper from banks and other financial institutions.
The International Finance Corporation, the private sector financing arm of
the World Bank, is also expected to be an investor. A participation of up to
10 per cent of the fund's value, probably in cash, is awaiting approval by
the IFC's board.
The Peru Privatisation Fund will be managed by Montagu Mining Finance,
mining subsidiary of Midland's merchant banking unit.
Although mining will be an important element in the privatisation programme,
the fund will also consider investments in oil and gas, electricity
generation and distribution, fishing and manufacturing.
The fund aims to be operational by early next month when the privatisation
of Centromin, the mining, smelting and refining conglomerate, is scheduled
to take place.
The government has said that the base price for the company would be Dollars
280m in cash, plus at least Dollars 60m in debt paper and a minimum
investment of Dollars 240m over three years.
Previous debt-for-equity funds - also involving Midland and the IFC - have
been successful in both Argentina and Chile.
Montagu said the acceptance of debt in part payment for privatised assets
should increase investor interest in privatisation, reduce overall debt and
pave the way to an overall debt restructuring.
It should also, said an IFC official, help in the development of Peru's
domestic capital markets.
Peru has raised some Dollars 2.5bn in its privatisations so far, Dollars 2bn
coming in one unexpectedly large bid in the most recent telecommunications
sale.
After numerous delays, the process now appears to be going ahead in earnest,
although uncertainties remain about how exactly the debt swap mechanism will
work.

FT  17 MAR 94 / International Company News: Forestry group's river of gold
runs dry - A new Canadian newsprint mill has been idle since Christmas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Imagine having a spanking new car in your driveway but being unable to drive
it. That's the analogy used by a banker to describe the plight of the
newsprint mill at Gold River, British Columbia.
The CDollars 320m (USDollars 239m) mill, commissioned little more than four
years ago, is among the most modern in the world. But it has stood idle
since Christmas Eve as its leading shareholder, Canadian Pacific Forest
Products, haggles with international banks over its future.
The Gold River saga is being closely watched by forestry companies and their
bankers throughout North America. Industry executives are nervous that the
Gold River closure signals a growing impatience among lenders with an
industry which is reeling from four years of heavy losses.
For the bankers, the mill raises the difficult question of what to do with a
brand-new project when supply and demand for newsprint are finely balanced.
Prices remain near their lowest recessionary levels, and a new newsprint
machine is the last item on a pulp and paper company's shopping list. But
the market outlook has improved as the North American economies pick up.
Producers are expected to succeed in pushing through at least part of an 11
per cent price increase which took effect on March 1.
The eight-member Gold River banking syndicate has indicated, however, that
it wants substantial changes at the mill before it would agree to
restructure the CDollars 226m debt. It has turned down CP Forest's proposal
for short-term funding to keep the mill going.
Instead, the banks have explored more radical options such as a new
controlling shareholder to replace CP Forest, and converting the newsprint
machine to a different type of paper.
One member of the lending group notes that 'in the right hands and in the
proper circumstances, the facility is valuable'. The group is led by
Toronto-Dominion Bank, and includes National Westminster of the UK, Bank of
Tokyo, Union Bank of Switzerland, Australia's Westpac and three other
Canadian banks.
But the banks have so far come up empty-handed in their search for a buyer
or another operator. One sticking point is that the newsprint facility is
closely integrated with a nearby CP Forest pulp mill.
Rumours abound in the forestry industry that, should talks with CP Forest
fail, the machinery may be shipped elsewhere, probably to a US mill.
Nowhere is the discomfort greater than at CP Forest, which was a subsidiary
of Canadian Pacific, the diversified rail and resources group, until CP spun
its stake off to the public last year.
CP Forest initially took a 61 per cent stake in the Gold River limited
partnership. But its eight partners, who include publishers in the US,
Japan, UK and Singapore, have preferred to give up equity over the past four
years rather than participate in cash calls for the mill. As a result, CP
Forest's interest has climbed to 84 per cent.
Relations between CP Forest and the banks have been bumpy. The mill was
commissioned just as the newsprint market started sinking. 'We're a long way
short of the transaction prices we anticipated in the feasibility study,'
says Mr Norman Lord, who heads CP Forest's restructuring team.
To add to the problems, the mill's start-up was plagued by, among other
things, technical problems and soil subsidence.
The Montreal-based company vented its own frustrations late last year by
refusing to sink more money into the partnership. As a result, debt-service
payments were halted and the mill was unable to re-open after the Christmas
holidays.
CP Forest wrote off its entire CDollars 147m investment in the fourth
quarter, contributing to a CDollars 286m loss for 1993. Long viewed as one
of North America's stodgiest forestry groups, CP Forest has lost CDollars
1.12bn over the past four years. West coast lumber properties were spun off
last year into a new public company, and the same is being done with its
paperboard business. Several individual pulp and paper mills have been sold
or closed.
Progress in negotiations between CP Forest and the banks over Gold River has
so far been slow. The company has yet to deliver a revised business plan
which was promised by last month.
Mr Lord says that CP Forest was distracted by its short-term funding
proposal. The long-term plan will be submitted by the end of March, he says.
'Other than losing 2-3 weeks in the process (the negotiations) are running
pretty much as we'd expected.'
Whether Gold River eventually sinks or swims, it has fulfilled a purpose for
at least one group of stakeholders. In the four years that it operated, its
annual output of 230,000 tonnes has helped drive down west coast paper
prices.
Mr Mason Sizemore, chief operating officer of the Seattle Times newspaper,
consoles himself that intensified competition among newsprint suppliers has
made up for the write-off which his company has taken on its 5 per cent
stake in Gold River.

FT  17 MAR 94 / International Company News: Big reduction in Aerospatiale
losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Aerospatiale, the French aircraft and missiles group, yesterday announced a
sharp reduction in losses in 1993, from FFr2.38bn to FFr1.42bn (Dollars
246m), but warned of continued severe competition in international markets.
According to the group, the improvement in results was the result of
efficiency and economy measures, from lower spending on operating costs to
stricter controls on investments. Net debts were reduced from FFr16.5bn at
the end of 1992 to FFr13.3bn.
The state-owned aircraft company said that 1993 was 'profoundly affected by
the difficult situation facing airlines and overcapacity in the sector'. It
said its markets were also hit by severe competition for military orders
resulting from budgetary constraints. The various factors helped explain a
fall in turnover from FFr52.3bn in 1992 to FFr50.8bn and a decline in orders
from FFr39.8bn to FFr28.9bn.
Aerospatiale said the current year 'would probably not see any significant
improvement in the economic environment' and competition would remain
intense.

FT  17 MAR 94 / International Company News: Delayed documentation puts UAL
deal in doubt

   NEW YORK

<TEXT>
The future of the Dollars 5bn employee-led buy-out of UAL was in put in
doubt yesterday after the US airline announced it had been unable to reach a
definitive agreement with its employee unions.
When UAL and the pilots and machinists unions first agreed to the buy-out
last December, a deadline of March 15 was set for completion of the
documentation.
Pilots and ground crew unions, but not the flight attendants union, had
agreed to wage, benefit and work-rule concessions in return for a 53 per
cent stake in the company.
Yesterday, UAL revealed that the deadline had not been met, and said that
there could be no assurance that the transaction would be completed.
In the documents, which must be sent to the Securities and Exchange
Commission, UAL has to provide details of the transaction and a plan for how
it intends to run the airline after the buy-out.
Neither UAL nor the unions would comment on the delay, although yesterday
afternoon a representative of the pilots union said its leader was still in
talks with Mr Stephen Wolf, the airline's chairman, and an official from the
ground crew union.
The confirmation that the three sides were still talking helped reassure
investors, who earlier had been concerned about a possible collapse of the
buy-out.
UAL's shares, which had fallen Dollars 2 in early trading, recovered during
an afternoon rally in transportation stocks to end up Dollars 2 3/8 , at
Dollars 131 3/8 .
Although the failure of management and unions to complete the documentation
could yet scuttle the billion-dollar buy-out, analysts doubt that the delay
will kill the plan.
Mr Michael Derchin, airlines analyst at NatWest Securities in New York,
speculated that the delay was caused by UAL's failure to put together a new
management team in time for the documentation deadline.
He said: 'You can't go out with proxy material on this kind of a transaction
without stating who's going to run the company.' But Mr Derchin believed a
new management team would soon be appointed.

Record earnings from publishing and UK travel helped Thomson Corporation
overcome the poor performance of its North American newspapers last year.
Net earnings of the Canadian-controlled company rose to USDollars 277m, or
48 cents a share, from Dollars 166m, or 30 cents, in 1992. Revenues slipped
to Dollars 5.85bn from Dollars 5.98bn.
Last year's results include a fourth-quarter Dollars 75m after-tax charge
for the restructuring of Thomson's North American papers, especially the
five biggest dailies with circulations of over 75,000 copies. The
performance of these five papers, the biggest of which is Canada's Globe and
Mail, has lagged that of the group's smaller titles.
In 1992, Thomson's newspaper interests took a Dollars 170m charge, mainly
reflecting the reduced value of its UK community papers, most of which were
sold or closed.
Thomson Travel's operating earnings rose to Dollars 115m last year from
Dollars 104m. The improvement was dampened, however, by the drop in sterling
against the US dollar. The company said that the start of the summer 1994
booking season has been 'exceptionally strong', with bookings up 47 per cent
on the same time last year.
A Thomson official expressed the hope that the overall buoyancy in the UK
travel market would prevent any large-scale tour discounting this year. The
Lunn Poly travel-shop chain increased its market share of summer tours last
year. But the cost of opening 127 new shops pushed down profits.
Information and publishing results soared to Dollars 358m from Dollars 249m.
The recovery of UK regional newspapers gathered pace in the second half of
1993, although circulations of daily titles remained under pressure.
In the US, a strong performance by scientific and medical data services
helped overcome a 'severe' decline in pharmaceutical advertising and
automotive collision repair data.
Thomson, which is moving its executive offices from New York to Connecticut,
announced a split in its fast-growing specialised information and publishing
division.
The division will be separated into financial and professional publishing,
with annual revenues of Dollars 1bn; and a business, education and
information group, which will include the UK regional newspapers.

FT  17 MAR 94 / International Company News: Rhone-Poulenc will not lift bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Rhone-Poulenc, the French chemicals and pharmaceuticals group, yesterday
ruled out an increase in its FFr2.8bn (Dollars 486m) bid for Co-operation
Pharmaceutique Francaise (Cooper), one of France's biggest distributors of
drugs and healthcare products to retail chemists.
Mr Igor Landau, Rhone-Poulenc's managing director, said it was 'out of the
question to pay one franc more' for its FFr2,400 per share bid, which offers
an alternative of 18 Rhone-Poulenc shares for each of Cooper's.
Rhone-Poulenc's bid, which it describes as friendly, has been accepted by
Cooper's management. But it has met resistance from some shareholders.
Sabeton, a Lyon-based investment company which holds 21 per cent of Cooper's
shares has declined to say whether it would accept the offer. Predictions
about the level of support for the offer are further complicated by the
dispersed shareholdings in Cooper, with almost 40 per cent of the shares
held by about 3,000 retail chemists.
Rhone-Poulenc expressed confidence about winning the 67 per cent of Cooper's
shares, excluding treasury stock, which it has set as the target for
completing the deal. But Mr Landau warned of the consequences should the bid
fail.
In particular, he said that Rhone-Poulenc could withdraw its Doliprane
paracetamol from Cooper's distribution network and create its own
over-the-counter distribution network for Doliprane and other products.
Doliprane is one of France's largest selling drugs and represents one of
Cooper's largest sources of profits, according to Rhone-Poulenc.
The pharmaceuticals group, which was privatised at the end of last year,
said it remained determined to pursue its strategy of expanding its OTC and
self-medication activities. It sees the expansion of its distribution
activities as an important strategic move.

FT  17 MAR 94 / International Company News: Grolsch forecasts improvement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   AMSTERDAM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Grolsch, the Dutch brewer, posted virtually flat results in 1993 but it
expects to see a 'significant' rise in 1994, due in part to the recent
overhaul of its strategy in Britain and Germany.
Declining beer markets in north-west Europe caused net profit to remain at
Fl 43.5m (Dollars 22.9m) compared with Fl 43.4m in 1992, on turnover down
8.5 per cent at Fl 793.5m.
Since the start of 1994, Grolsch has set up a distribution joint venture
with Bass, the UK's largest brewer, to boost sales in Britain and Ireland.
It has also announced the sale of Wickuler, its subsidiary in Germany, to
the German brewer Brau und Brunnen, in return for a distribution pact that
will give Grolsch entry to 6,000 cafes across Germany within five years.
These changes, plus efficiency measures at home, should lead to a
significant improvement in 1994.
Mr Paul Snoep, chairman, said Grolsch did not rule out future acquisitions.
But in contrast to the 1991 acquisition of Wickuler, which gave Grolsch a
range of local beers and the prospects of a gradual introduction of its own
brand in Germany, any takeover must have as its prime goal the accelerated
expansion of the Grolsch brand.
He denied that the Wickuler investment represented a failure in corporate
policy, saying it had given Grolsch the opportunity to enter into a
partnership with Brau und Brunnen and achieve a breakthrough in
distribution.
In the UK, the Bass deal will give the British brewer the right to produce
Grolsch beer locally, with the exception of beer bottled in Grolsch's
trademark swing-top bottles.
The move is a departure for Grolsch, which was previously keen to set itself
apart in the UK by being a foreign-brewed beer. But Mr Snoep said,
'Extensive market research has shown that UK consumers are used to drinking
foreign lagers that are brewed and bottled in the UK.' Grolsch had no plans
for a similar production arrangement in the US, its second biggest market.

FT  17 MAR 94 / International Company News: Bull full-year loss tops FFr5bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Groupe Bull, the French computer group which is slated for privatisation
this year, has taken restructuring provisions of FFr1.65bn (Dollars 286m) in
its accounts for 1993, taking total net losses for the year to FFr5.07bn.
The result compares with a deficit of FFr4.72bn in 1992 and means that total
losses for the past four years have amounted to FFr19.9bn. Operating losses
grew to FFr1.89bn from FFr642m, while sales declined to FFr28.25bn from
FFr30.19bn.
The company's financial plight and the French government's decision to
privatise the group as quickly as possible has prompted a recovery plan
aimed at returning the group to profit by 1995.
Mr Jean-Marie Descarpentries, who took over as chairman last October, is
implementing cost cutting and measures to improve productivity. Industrial
partners are being sought to take stakes in the company and allow its entry
into the private sector.
The group said that priority is to be given to internal revenue growth. It
said the experience of the past few months, which saw a 22 per cent increase
in sales in January and February, year-on-year, showed this is possible.
Bull is aiming for a 'drastic reduction in all non-salary costs'. The
reduction in the number of its Paris sites, for example, is expected to save
FFr500m this year.
A FFr7bn capital injection from the French government to support the
computer group is currently being examined by the European Commission. Its
acceptance will depend on the viability of the recovery plan and the
company's success in finding industrial partners.

FT  17 MAR 94 / International Company News: Tapie agrees repayments to
Credit Lyonnais
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Credit Lyonnais has reached agreement with Mr Bernard Tapie for the
businessman-turned-politician to start selling his corporate and personal
assets to repay the FFr1bn (Dollars 160m) he owes the bank.
The agreement, confirmed yesterday by both sides, is another move in the
financial restructuring of the troubled state bank, which is expected to be
finalised next week when Credit Lyonnais announces its 1993 results.
The chief plank of an expected restructuring is likely to be the funnelling
of some FFr20bn worth of non-performing property loans into a separate
company which will be bolstered by an injection of some FFr3-FFr4bn from the
French government.
'It means we have turned off the tap (of credit) for Mr Tapie, and turned
over a new page for the bank,' said a Credit Lyonnais spokesman yesterday.
The Bernard Tapie Group, wholly owned by Mr Tapie, said it would be
recapitalising certain of its corporate assets - believed to include two
makers of industrial weighing machines, Terraillon and Testut, and also La
Vie Claire, a chain of health food shops - in order to sell them.
In borrowing from Credit Lyonnais over the past 20 years, chiefly through
its small subsidiary, Societe de Banque Occidentale (SDBO), Mr Tapie had
mortgaged personal assets, including the Paris mansion that he bought from
the founder of the Givenchy luxury goods business. Credit Lyonnais is
calling in this mortgage.
Credit Lyonnais would not comment on whether there was any deadline by which
Mr Tapie had to repay his debts but said he would at least get 'several
months' for the economy and property market to improve so he could realise
the best price for his assets.
If Mr Tapie were pushed into forced sales, the bank might not get all its
money back and would be obliged to make loss provisions in its accounts.

black
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   DUISBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Klockner-Werke, once the weakest link in the German steel industry, expects
to be back in the black this year, having disposed of most of its steel
interests, and written off much of its steel-related debt burden.
The company has been transformed into an internationally-diversified
plastics and engineering group, with a residual interest in the Bremen-based
Klockner Steel integrated plant, Mr Hans Christoph von Rohr, the chief
executive, said yesterday.
In spite of a drastic restructuring programme, launched last year as part of
the 'composition proceedings' - the last step before bankruptcy under German
financial law - Klockner Werke still suffered a loss of DM376m in its
1992/93 financial year, of which DM361m (Dollars 213m) was directly
attributable to the steel operations.
The company is awaiting a final decision in early April by Sidmar, the
Belgian steel-making subsidiary of the Arbed group, on whether it will take
a 25 per cent stake in the Bremen steel plant. If the deal goes ahead,
Klockner's own stake will drop to 25 per cent and management of the plant
will be transferred to Sidmar.
Mr von Rohr said that the Bremen plant would be making a profit in 1994,
thanks to the restructuring measures.

FT  17 MAR 94 / UK Company News: JN Nichols recovers in second half to
Pounds 8.65m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits for JN Nichols (Vimto), the soft drinks company, improved
slightly from Pounds 8.54m to Pounds 8.65m in the year to December 31.
The result marked a recovery in the second half following a fall from Pounds
3.53m to Pounds 3.4m at the interim stage.
There were improvements for the core Vimto fruit and herb drink,
particularly overseas, and the foods offshoot, which made up for falls in
the canning operations.
Mr John Nichols, managing director, said that the first half of the year,
which had been affected by a poor May and June, was always more dependent on
the weather than the second.
He added that it was too soon to say how the present year would turn out but
he thought the market for Vimto was growing on the back of the expanding
cola market. 'And there will always be a niche for Vimto.'
Turnover for the year improved by Pounds 2.5m to Pounds 49.5m for increased
operating profit of Pounds 7.93m (Pounds 7.48m). Earnings per share came out
at 14.98p (14.16p) and a proposed increased final dividend of 3.6p makes a
total for the year of 5.76p (5.44p).
The Manchester-based company is concentrating on expanding its overseas
markets and food activities.
The launch on the Russian market was going well with the export of canned
Vimto expected to be replaced in the near future by local production based
on concentrate from the UK.
The foods side now provided Pounds 15m of group turnover and was about to
move into a purpose-built factory.
Mr Nichols said the contract canning activities were dependent on the
weather but as the operation switched from contract work to Vimto that was
becoming a less of a factor.

FT  17 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Rea Brothers more than doubled to Pounds 2m
</HEADLINE>

   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rea Brothers, the private banking group, announced pre-tax profits more than
doubled from Pounds 805,000 to Pounds 2.05m in 1993, helped by a turnround
from its fund management operations.
Net interest income fell marginally to Pounds 3.98m (Pounds 4.2m) because of
lower interest rates and the company's conservative lending policy. Customer
accounts grew to Pounds 239m (Pounds 238m), while loans and advances to
customers fell by Pounds 2m to Pounds 27m.
Fee income, however, increased by 35 per cent to Pounds 9.44m, boosting
overall operating income to Pounds 14.1m, compared with Pounds 11.7m. The
company's corporate finance and trust administration businesses, both had
record years.
Rea Brothers' fund management operation, however, was the main source of
growth. Mr Roger Parsons, managing director, said the company had increased
funds under management more than threefold in the past three and a half
years.
The fund management business made a pre-tax contribution of Pounds 647,000
compared with a small loss in 1992, with funds increasing by 22 per cent
during the year.
Rea Brothers made a Pounds 300,000 provision for legal costs related to
proceedings against the company over a now defunct pension scheme.
The directors have recommended a final dividend of 0.45p, making a total of
0.75p, a 50 per cent increase.
Earnings per share increased more substantially to 4.05p (0.82p) because of
a marginal fall in tax payments.

FT  17 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Church surges by 70% to Pounds 3.2m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits of Church &amp; Co, the footwear manufacturer and retailer,
surged by 70 per cent from Pounds 1.9m to Pounds 3.2m for 1993, boosted by a
'most significant' advance from its wholly owned subsidiary A Jones &amp; Sons.
Group sales advanced by 7 per cent to Pounds 74m (Pounds 68.9m).
Earnings per share were 17.4p, up 45 per cent on last year's 12p, while the
dividend is stepped up to 13p (12.5p) with a final distribution of 10p.
The directors' aim is to return to a dividend cover of two times as soon as
possible.
Mr John G Church, the chairman, said that Church Footwear and Cheaney
further improved their performance. However, losses were incurred in the two
North American companies, while the French retail concern also suffered a
modest loss, mainly as a result of recessionary pressures in continental
Europe.
The chairman explained that 1993 was a year of consolidation in which 'we
concentrated specifically on improving the profit performance of our various
subsidiary companies, both in manufacturing and retail.'
The group, he added, acquired a further 25 per cent in its Hong Kong
associate, taking the holding to 50 per cent.
Results for A Jones revealed a jump in pre-tax profits from Pounds 569,000
to Pounds 1.7m for the 12 months, from turnover of Pounds 33.9m (Pounds
30.15m). During 1993 a shop was opened at 133 Bond Street, London, and two
more shops will be opened this year. However two others are being closed.

FT  17 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Britton Pounds 2.7m in black - Gelpack and
Taco help with turnround
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britton Group, the packaging company created from the shell of Firstland Oil
and Gas, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.73m in 1993.
The figures included a full year from Gelpack, acquired in October 1992 and
five months from Taco, bought last August for Pounds 36.7m funded by a
rights issue and placing.
In 1992 the group recorded a loss of Pounds 2.32m, of which Pounds 2.1m was
the disposal loss on the oil and gas interests.
Group turnover was Pounds 26.8m, with Pounds 13.3m coming from Gelpack and
Pounds 13.5m from Taco. Operating profits were Pounds 2.96m, with Pounds
1.96m contributed by the higher margin Taco business. Interest charges were
Pounds 226,000.
Mr Robin Williams, chief executive, said the group's strategy was to develop
a packaging group with two or three divisions in fragmented sectors of the
industry. With two acquisitions Britton was already the second largest UK
polythene extruder.
Adding another division would require further external funding.
Gearing was 17 per cent at the year end, assuming full payment of Pounds
5.5m deferred consideration for Taco. However, Taco is now not expected to
meet its earn-out target and Britton hoped to claw back much of that money,
giving the group's negligible gearing, said Mr Simon Beart, finance
director.
Britton is planning a 10-for-1 share consolidation as it has 514m shares in
issue.
A final dividend of 0.09p is proposed to give an effective total for the
year of 0.15p. Earnings per share were 0.68p.
Mr Beart said the 26 per cent tax rate in 1993 was artificially low and
would probably rise to about 31 per cent in future.

FT  17 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Spandex advances 22% and makes Pounds 2.9m
purchase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Spandex rose 35p to 585p yesterday after the USM-quoted
distributor of sign-making equipment announced a 22 per cent increase in
profits and a Pounds 2.9m acquisition.
The Bristol-based group saw pre-tax profits rise to Pounds 5.45m (Pounds
4.46m) in the year to December 31, despite continuing recession in some of
its key European markets.
Growing sales of sign-making materials and labelling products lifted group
turnover 8 per cent to Pounds 59.2m (Pounds 55m), while operating profits
moved ahead from Pounds 5.4m to Pounds 5.9m.
Increased turnover in Europe - dominated by Germany, accounting for 34 per
cent of sales - left the group with net cash of Pounds 3.75m (Pounds 3m) at
the year end.
Gearing, meanwhile, fell from 28.6 per cent to 2.7 per cent after the group
cut net debt to Pounds 388,000 (Pounds 4.27m).
Mr Dick Bostock, finance director, said gearing would increase following the
group's FFr25m (Pounds 2.9m) cash acquisition of Adhebak, the French
distributor of self-adhesive vinyls.
The acquisition, involving an initial FFr17.5m payment and FFr1.5m payable
in three further tranches, will complete Spandex's distribution network in
western Europe.
Mr Bostock said the group was now considering expansion in eastern Europe
and envisaged strong demand for new machinery, such as its 'Gerber Edge'
computerised sign-making equipment.
Earnings per share improved to 32p (22.5p), while a recommended final
dividend of 4.9p (4.6p) makes a total of 7p, compared with 6.5p. The group
also announced a 2-for-1 scrip issue.

The pre-tax loss of Pounds 285,000 compared with a profit of Pounds 396,000
last time, but represents a small improvement on the loss of Pounds 481,000
reported at the interim stage.
The first-half result had been hit by a Pounds 995,000 exceptional charge
for two branch closures and provisions for the full effect of the
receivership of Swan Hunter, one of its main clients.
Mr Peter Wardle, chairman, said that in common with most other companies in
the building and construction sectors, Chieftain had suffered from the
severe and prolonged recession.
Turnover for the year fell from Pounds 14.9m to Pounds 12.6m, however, at
the trading level, profits were slightly up at Pounds 623,000 (Pounds
613,000).
Losses per share emerged at 3.33p (4.36p earnings) and the final dividend is
reduced by 1p to 2p, making 3.5p (5.1p) for the year.
Despite the difficulties during the period, the group ended the year with no
borrowings, a cash balance of about Pounds 1m and a firm order book of
Pounds 7m, Mr Wardle said.
Since the year end the acquisition of Blackett Charlton had been concluded
at a purchase price of Pounds 25,000, he added.

Reflecting continued progress with Budgie The Little Helicopter, Sleepy
Kids, the independent producer of children's animation, yesterday reported
that profits accelerated in the second half of 1992-93 and for the year to
October 31 came through at Pounds 89,235 compared with a loss of Pounds
356,243.
The USM-traded company, which owns the worldwide rights to animate and
merchandise Budgie, is confident about showing further progress at the
interim stage.
There is no dividend but Mr Martin Powell, chairman, said once the trading
pattern became firmly established a progressive dividend policy would be
adopted.
The shares closed 12p lower at 105p.
Mr Powell said the improved results were achieved when Budgie was at the
early stages of development. In the current year many licensing agreements
had been entered into covering a wide range of Budgie products.
Turnover for the year was Pounds 262,696 (Pounds 88,293) and earnings per
share were 0.33p (losses 1.52p).

FT  17 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Cliveden chief buys Principal Hotels chain
from receiver
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Principal Hotels, which went into receivership two years ago with debts of
Pounds 100m, has been taken over in a Pounds 65m deal led by Mr John Lewis,
chairman of Cliveden, the former stately home that is now a luxury hotel.
Principal, based in Leeds, has 22 hotels, mainly of three-star standard,
with two in both Denmark and the Netherlands. The chain includes the
Norbreck Castle in Blackpool, the Royal in York, and the Imperial in
Harrogate.
It has been run successfully by its management under Mr Edward Klempka,
corporate recovery partner of Coopers &amp; Lybrand in Leeds, the receiver,
making Pounds 6m profit in 1992 and Pounds 7.5m last year.
Mr Lewis, who will be keeping his prestigious Cliveden operation entirely
separate, won a tight contest against a consortium led by Legal &amp; General
and Mr Michael Purtill, Principal's managing director.
Mr Purtill will leave the group, but the rest of the management team will
continue under Mr Lewis, and will get some equity participation.
The price paid for Principal is not being disclosed, but is believed to be
close to Pounds 60m, with the remainder of the Pounds 65m being raised for
working capital.
About Pounds 31m of the total finance is equity, provided by NatWest
Ventures, the leader of the deal, Granville Development Capital, Prudential
Ventures, Bankers Trust and Royal Bank Development Capital.
The loan finance is being provided by Morgan Grenfell and the Bank of
Scotland, but it is believed that Barclays Bank may also participate.
Blenheim Capital Ventures, a new financial services group set up by former
Bank of Tokyo and Hill Samuel staff, facilitated the deal and brought
together the equity partners.
Mr Lewis takes on all liabilities incurred by the receiver during the
two-year administration, but the deal excludes any pre-receivership debt.

FT  17 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Lambert Howarth hit by reorganisation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After providing for the cost of a reorganisation, Lambert Howarth Group, the
footwear supplier, reported pre-tax profits halved from Pounds 2.99m to
Pounds 1.42m in the year to end-December.
The outcome was achieved on turnover up by 10 per cent from Pounds 56.6m to
Pounds 62.6m, of which Pounds 4.3m related to Tecnic Shoes, acquired at the
end of last year.
The pre-tax outcome was struck after providing Pounds 706,000 for
reorganisation, while last year's results benefited from a Pounds 363,000
one-off profit on realisation of fixed assets.
A fall in net investment and interest income from Pounds 377,000 to Pounds
25,000 this time also impacted on the result.
After a tax credit of Pounds 72,000 (Pounds 713,000 charge) earnings per
share came out at 24.9p (39.2p). Despite the downturn an improved final
dividend of 9.25p (8.75p) is proposed, making 13.75p (13p) for the year.
The benefits of the restructuring were not expected to come through quickly,
the company said, but by the second half there should be some firm evidence
of improvement.

FT  17 MAR 94 / UK Company News: More acquisitions for Coats
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Neville Bain, chief executive of Coats Viyella, Europe's largest textiles
company, and Sir David Alliance, chairman, have set their sights on more
acquisitions this year, writes Daniel Green.
New companies made a strong contribution to Coats' annual results published
yesterday. The company has brought gearing down to 31 per cent, the level it
was three years ago before it took over Tootal, the thread maker, in a
Pounds 252m hostile bid.
'The acquisitions are likely to be under Pounds 50m each', said Mr Bain,
adding that a figure as high as Pounds 100m was possible.
Target businesses are likely to be in the company's biggest areas of
business: thread, clothing, homewares and precision engineering outside the
UK.
The company also announced yesterday the Dollars 12.5m (Pounds 8.5m)
purchase of a US precision plastics company, Precision Engineering of
Minneapolis, Minnesota.

FT  17 MAR 94 / UK Company News: ICL shows 40% fall to Pounds 23.4m -
Outcome depressed by restructuring charges and higher interest costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Restructuring charges, higher interest payments and weak markets depressed
1993 pre-tax profits at ICL, the UK-based computer company owned by Fujitsu
of Japan.
However, Mr Peter Bonfield, chairman and chief executive, said ICL had
achieved its objectives: to improve revenues, reduce overheads, remain
profitable and conserve cash.
After deducting restructuring charges of Pounds 47.7m (Pounds 33.9m) and net
interest costs of Pounds 25.2m (Pounds 22m), pre-tax profits for the year to
end-December fell by 40 per cent from Pounds 38.6m to Pounds 23.4m.
Turnover improved 6 per cent from Pounds 2.48bn to Pounds 2.62bn, and after
a higher tax charge of Pounds 18m (Pounds 10.4m) and minority interests of
Pounds 4.8m (Pounds 1.9m) retained earnings were Pounds 600,000 (Pounds
26.3m).
Year-end net debt was reduced to Pounds 51m (Pounds 94.2m), giving gearing
of 18 per cent. ICL raised Pounds 50m from Fujitsu last year through a
rights issue with the guarantee of a further Pounds 50m this year.
Mr Bonfield said the company had spent more than Pounds 1bn on acquisitions,
joint ventures, research and development and rationalisation over the past
three years.
Last year it spent Pounds 209m on research and development. It aims to work
more closely with Fujitsu on advanced projects to share costs. In
particular, ICL is working on a joint multimedia venture which the Japanese
company is funding.
ICL has undergone substantial reorganisation in the past three years. The
company now derives more revenues from computing services than from hardware
manufacture. Mainframe sales account for less than 10 per cent of revenues.
The company has been split up into 26 semi-autonomous business units to
achieve a better market focus while controlling costs. The business units
demonstrate a diversity of growth and profitability.
Revenues at CFM Group, ICL's facilities management operation, grew by 77 per
cent last year, while sales in the retail systems unit grew by 17 per cent.
Pressure on costs and staff numbers had been maintained, Mr Bonfield said.
Overheads had been reduced by about Pounds 100m last year while staff
numbers, currently about 25,000, were being reduced by an average of 5 per
cent a year.
Plans to float up to 49 per cent of the company on the London Stock Exchange
are still in place, but await improved economic conditions.
Mr Bonfield said he saw no improvement in the market, but that 1994 would
see the completion of restructuring measures and the elimination of much of
the company's debt, giving the possibility of improved profits in 1995.

FT  17 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Telspec ahead of forecast with Pounds 3.4m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Telspec, the Kent-based manufacturer of advanced electronic
telecommunications equipment, yesterday reported higher-than-expected
pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.41m for 1993.
The figure, which compared with Pounds 3.36m for 1992 and a forecast of not
less than Pounds 3.3m set out in the flotation prospectus, reflected strong
growth for the company's products in the UK.
As expected, earnings per share emerged at 8.28p (7.13p). There is no
dividend, although the group has indicated its intention to pay an interim
dividend for the six months to end-June.
Telspec's shares, which were placed with institutional investors at 160p in
December, closed 3p higher at 283p yesterday valuing the group at Pounds
88.8m.
A decline in turnover to Pounds 17.6m (Pounds 18.2m) reflected the
anticipated fall in sales by the group's Telspec Australia subsidiary to
Telecom Australia. Telspec expected the economic recovery in Australia to
lead to higher order levels this year.
In December the group won a Pounds 7m contract to supply equipment to
Deutsche Telekom. It has also entered into a joint venture agreement to
manufacture its products in Slovakia and has won an initial Pounds 3.5m
order from Slovak Telecom.
Since flotation Telspec has significantly expanded its marketing efforts
resulting in an expanded order book of Pounds 31m.
However, the group cautioned that the market for its products remained
competitive and that this was likely to lead to some pressure on margins in
some product areas.
Pre-tax profits for 1993 were boosted by net interest receipts of Pounds
44,000, against previous net interest costs of Pounds 109,000, and by Pounds
199,000 (Pounds 95,000) in government grants.
Commenting on the results Mr Frank Hackett-Jones, chairman, said the
successful flotation in December had marked a significant milestone,
'setting the stage for strong growth in years to come.
'Our international customer base has been successfully expanded and overall
demand for Telspec's products has risen to record levels,' he said.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Merivale Moore swung back into the black in the half year to end-December as
the property company reported signs of a 'fairly significant improvement in
the residential and commercial property markets'.
On sales and rents down from a restated Pounds 13.4m to Pounds 6.2m, the
company returned pre-tax profits of Pounds 133,000 for the period, against a
deficit of Pounds 2.68m last time.
The outcome was boosted by a fall in interest charges from Pounds 3.64m to
Pounds 1.78m and reduced administrative expenses of Pounds 583,000 (Pounds
719,000).
After a Pounds 44,000 tax bill (Pounds 247,000 credit) earnings per share
worked through at 0.65p (17.83p losses).
The board expects to announce a dividend with the full year results.

<TEXT>
Broadcastle, the USM-quoted financial services group, nearly doubled pre-tax
profits from Pounds 276,000 to Pounds 507,000 in 1993.
The improvement was because of a fall in interest payable to Pounds 781,000
(Pounds 1.08m), lower administrative expenses of Pounds 787,000 (Pounds
1.03m) and a reduction in the provision for bad and doubtful debts to Pounds
383,000 (Pounds 436,000).
Net income amounted to Pounds 1.68m (Pounds 1.76m). Earnings per share rose
from 1.17p to 2.2p and the group, which returned to the dividend list at the
interim stage, is proposing a final of 0.75p for a 1p total.

Specialeyes, the USM-traded retail optician, incurred a pre-tax loss of
Pounds 481,000 for the 12 months ended November 27 on a turnover from
continuing activities of Pounds 20.54m.
The figures compared with Pounds 2.27m and Pounds 25.94m respectively for
the 78 weeks to November 28 1992.
The second half, normally the stronger period, was seriously affected by a
downturn in sales in the run up to the Chancellor's autumn Budget.
However, for the opening 14 weeks of the current year sales were ahead of
budget. A 'clear programme' for the next stage of recovery in 1994 was also
in hand.
Losses per share for the year emerged at 3.11p (14.16p for the 78 weeks).

FT  17 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Premier Oil slips by 33%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Premier Consolidated Oilfields, independent exploration and production
company, yesterday reported a 33 per cent fall in 1993 net profits to Pounds
10.1m, as planned maintenance programmes eroded production and low oil
prices took their toll of revenues.
Turnover at Pounds 45.9m was 18 per cent lower. Earnings per share fell to
1.84p from 2.76p.
The impact of a 21-day maintenance shutdown at the onshore Wytch Farm field
and the decommissioning of the Angus offshore field was reflected in last
year's average production figure, which slipped to about 12,000 barrels a
day of oil equivalent (including natural gas) from 13,888 b/d last time. But
Mr Charles Jamieson, chief executive, said current production had recovered
to 1992 levels and was set to rise to 20,000 b/d within two years.
Cash balances stood at Pounds 47.2m at year end, with debt of Dollars 120m.
Gearing was 50 per cent.
The removal by the government last year of petroleum revenue tax relief on
exploration and appraisal drilling was reflected in an Pounds 8.8m one-off
exceptional charge. The amount relates to deferred PRT in prior years.
Mr Roland Shaw, chairman, said that aside from the exceptional charge, the
loss of tax relief on exploration expenditure had been 'offset to some
extent by the lower PRT rate'.
Analysts said the exceptional charge was the only surprise in the results,
which were otherwise in line with expectations.
Additional appraisal of finds enabled the company to boost its estimate of
proven reserves by 15 per cent.
Mr Jamieson said the low oil price environment had caused the company to
focus on projects which could lead to an early payback. He said 75 per cent
of the company's effort would be aimed at projects which could enhance short
to medium term cash flow, with 25 per cent reserved for longer term
exploration activity.
COMMENT
Cuba, Cambodia and Myanmar are just a few of the exotic though difficult
locations which have appealed to Premier's explorers So far the strategy of
going into difficult countries has worked well. Premier gets good terms and
large stakes. If finds are made some of the stake is farmed out topay for
development, leaving the company with a good chunk of the consequent
production. But if oil prices linger at low levels it can only extend the
strategy if the majors which operate many of its producing fields can
continue to make significant cuts in their costs.

FT  17 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Independent Insurance at Pounds 15.9m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A turnround in underwriting results in the UK pulled Independent Insurance,
the small general insurance company floated on the stock market last year,
firmly back into the black in 1993.
Pre-tax profits amounted to Pounds 15.9m (Pounds 3.72m) including realised
gains of Pounds 5.6m (Pounds 3.7m).
Underwriting profits of Pounds 2m compared with losses of Pounds 7m in 1992.
Further losses on stop loss policies underwritten for Lloyd's Names in 1989
and 1990 amounted to Pounds 5.2m (Pounds 8.5m) and held back what would have
been even stronger profit growth.
Overall gross written premiums increased by 52 per cent to Pounds 215.7m
(Pounds 141.8m). Investment income increased to Pounds 8.3m (Pounds 7m). Its
share of profits of associated undertakings was Pounds 16,000, against
losses of Pounds 19,000.
Earnings per share improved to 35.2p (10.9p) and, as forecast, a final
dividend of 4.75p is proposed, making a total of 8.25p (7p), an increase of
18 per cent.
COMMENT
The markets responded positively to yesterday's result, marking the shares
up 5p to 295p. Independent's focused underwriting approach means it is well
placed to continue profit growth this year, despite indications of a return
of some rate competition in the UK market. The group's premiums from
personal motor - where price pressure will be strongest - amounts to only
about 17 per cent of its total premium income. Moreover, Independent has
begun to specialise in non-standard risks such as 'classic' cars, which
should be less affected by competition. Its emphasis on risk control and
surveying allows it to record better results on commercial business than the
market average and it appears that the worst of the Lloyd's stop loss
problems, which have dampened profitability in the last two years, are over.
1994 profits of about Pounds 20m (before capital gains) look well within
reach, putting the shares on an attractive multiple going forward of about
9. Investors should bear in mind, however, that the shares are now trading
at a premium to net asset value of more than 40 per cent while the historic
yield of 3.5 is at a substantial discount to the rest of the sector.

FT  17 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Domnick Hunter priced at Pounds 65m
following share placing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Domnick Hunter Group, which makes filters for compressed air and
liquids, have been placed with institutions at 200p, valuing the group at
Pounds 65.2m.
The shares were aggressively priced at 21.5 times historic earnings,
reflecting the high level of interest shown in the company during its
presentations.
Analysts said the north-east of England group was one of the best to be
floated in the past year.
The value of the placing was Pounds 20.9m, with 32.1 per cent of the
enlarged ordinary share capital being placed. Net proceeds receivable by the
company will be Pounds 15.3m.
Mr Brian Thompson, executive chairman, said: 'We are delighted with the
level of interest that institutions have shown and we are looking forward to
an exciting future as a quoted company.'
The group, which employs 554 people and exports more than 60 per cent of its
sales to more than 40 countries, claims to be a world leader in
high-efficiency compressed air filtration. Its filters can purify air to one
million times cleaner than the air we breathe.
About 75 per cent of the group's sales last year were in industrial
products, used to purify and dry compressed air and gases. Activities are
split between the group headquarters at Birtley and a factory at Team
Valley, both in Tyne and Wear.
The prospectus was published yesterday and dealings in the shares are
expected to begin on Tuesday, March 29. The flotation is being sponsored by
Granville and Company, with NatWest Wood Mackenzie acting as brokers to the
issue.
The notional net dividend per share for the year to December 31 was 4.25p,
giving a notional gross dividend yield of 2.7 per cent.

FT  17 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Cortecs Intl seeking Pounds 15m in
flotation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cortecs International, the pharmaceuticals company, is planning to raise
about Pounds 15m through a flotation on the London Stock Exchange next
month.
The company, incorporated in Australia but with research, development,
manufacturing and sales in the UK, already has an Australian listing. The
shares closed there yesterday at ADollars 1.05, barely changed on the day,
representing a market capitalisation of about ADollars 80m (Pounds 39.4m).
The shares will be issued at the equivalent of not less than ADollars 1.05,
said Henry Cooke Lumsden, the Manchester-based stockbroker which is handling
the flotation.
Cortecs has three strands to its business.
research into drug delivery systems, such as capsules for swallowing.
manufacture and marketing of medications. In one of its businesses, these
two activities are combined: it imports the arthritis drug Diclomax into the
UK in bulk and puts it into capsules. developing diagnostic equipment.
Henry Cooke Lumsden said it hoped to issue a pathfinder prospectus at the
end of next week and complete a placing by mid-April.
The health of such companies is partially measured by their cash balances
and rate at which they consume capital. The company's 1993 report and
accounts shows cash of ADollars 998,000, compared with Dollars A6.54m a year
earlier.

FT  17 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Amstrad in computer printer venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Amstrad, the consumer electronics group headed by Mr Alan Sugar, is
re-entering the mainstream computer printer market through a collaborative
agreement with Jarfalla ICC, the Swedish computer printer manufacturer that
until last week was 100 per cent-owned by IBM.
Prototypes of the first jointly developed product, a compact ink jet printer
using a new type of print head, were being shown at the CEBit European
computer fair which opened in Hanover yesterday.
Mr Malcolm Miller, Amstrad's group managing director, said, 'We have been
looking for opportunities to increase the price competitiveness and
technological performance of our computers and computer related products.
'I believe this collaboration may lead us back into the printer market, a
sector we put on the back burner some time ago, awaiting such an
opportunity.'
Amstrad engineers have designed the printer cabinet, carriage assembly and
the electronics which drive the new printer while Jarfalla has designed the
shuttle assembly including the critical print head.
Mr Miller said the new printer, which is due to begin shipping this summer,
will be sold both as an Amstrad badged product and available for OEM
manufacture.
Jarfalla, which has annual sales of about Pounds 100m and has been making
printers for almost 25 years, was IBM's biggest printer manufacturing
facility.
As part of IBM's retrenchment last year, it was one of four European IBM
plants which were set up as 'independent business units' run by their local
managements and warned that if they did not make a profit within 12 months
they would close.
The company is now jointly owned by IBM Svenska, which has a 35 per cent
stake, and Atle Forvaltnings, a Swedish venture capital group.
In recent weeks Amstrad has made a flurry of product announcements including
a new range of highly competitive personal computers built around Intel's
80486 microprocessors, new facsimile machines and advanced feature
telephones.
Yesterday Mr Sugar and Mr Bordan Tkachuk, Amstrad's sales and marketing
director, underlined the group's renewed commitment to the 'brown goods'
sector by unveiling new ranges of audio, VCR, and satellite products.

FT  17 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Tarmac plans Dollars 100m US efficiency
drive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tarmac, the construction group, yesterday announced plans for a Dollars 100m
(Pounds 68.4m) investment and reorganisation of its US businesses which it
estimates could reduce the division's overheads by a fifth.
It forms part of a group-wide efficiency drive launched by Mr Neville Simms,
chief executive, who has already substantially reduced costs in the UK
housing division.
The three year programme will include a Dollars 20m investment to overhaul
the group's Pennsuco quarry near Miami. The company will also be improving
its fleet of ready-mix concrete lorries.
In addition Tarmac is reorganising its US management which previously had
operated as separate regions into three product based businesses: aggregates
and cement, ready-mix concrete and concrete products.
Construction activity, particularly housebuilding, has been recovering in
the US, although building activity in the first few months of this year has
been restricted by bad winter weather.
Nonetheless, building material companies are expecting to see further
recovery in earnings during 1994.

FT  17 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Oxford Molecular Pounds 30m flotation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Oxford Molecular, the first company to be spun out from Oxford University,
is planning a Pounds 30m flotation next month which will value the
university's stake at about Pounds 3m.
The company was formed in 1989 to commercialise computer software for use in
drug design developed at Oxford and other academic laboratories around the
world.
Although it recorded a loss of Pounds 1.2m on revenues of only Pounds 1.4m
last year the company is keen to distance itself from other 'blue sky'
flotations, particularly those in the biotechnology sector.
Mr Martin Robinson, of Henry Cooke Lumsden, the company's stockbrokers said:
'Oxford Molecular is not asking for money to develop technology but to
expand and market technology that is tried, tested and already selling.'
He compared the company to Tadpole Technology and Division, the successful
flotations of which the broker also handled.
Rather than invest heavily in development itself Oxford Molecular takes
software written by academics, to whom it pays royalties, which it turns
into a commercial product. Mr Tony Marchington, deputy chairman, said this
approach was one of its strengths.
'Our main US rivals have taken one product from a university which they add
to in-house. We get a continuous transfer from 30 academic teams around the
world.' He said the relationships with these academics represent a 'high
barrier to entry'.
The market for 'computational' chemistry software is currently worth about
Dollars 200m (Pounds 140m) and is growing at an estimated 25 per cent a
year.
Most is used by computer experts but Mr Marchington argues that the software
will soon find its way onto the desk-top computers of chemists without
specialist computer knowledge. 'Then the market will grow by an order of
magnitude.'
Customers include Pfizer, Glaxo, SmithKline Beecham and British
Bio-technology.
All the Pounds 10m to be raised from the flotation will go to the company
with the existing shareholders barred from selling for two years.
The company was co-founded by Mr Marchington, 38, who worked for ICI after
completing his doctorate at Oxford, and Mr Graham Richards, 54, a reader in
computational chemistry. Mr Timothy Cooke, who spent 20 years with software
house Logica, has joined as chief operating officer.

FT  17 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Marley in the red after goodwill write-back
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Marley, the buildings material group, enjoyed a 55 per cent rise in
operating profits to Pounds 41.5m in 1993 but the write-back of goodwill,
interest charges and a small loss on a disposal left it with a loss of
Pounds 1.1m pre-tax.
The results were slightly lower than some analysts had expected following
the big profits rise announced on Tuesday by rival building products group
Wolseley, and Marley's shares fell 10p to 195p.
Following the disposal last year of its Nottingham and Errol Brick
subsidiaries in an asset swap with Tarmac, Marley had to charge against its
1993 profits Pounds 32.8m of goodwill previously written off against
reserves.
Pre-tax profits for 1992 were Pounds 4.6m after a Pounds 3.5m loss on a
disposal.
Turnover rose from Pounds 561m to Pounds 622m. Net interest payable amounted
to Pounds 11.1m against Pounds 9m.
Losses per share were 4.4p (0.5p). Excluding losses on disposals and the
goodwill write-back, earnings per share were 7.3p (0.7p). A final dividend
of 2.1p is proposed, maintaining the total at 4.2p.
Operating profits in the UK, benefiting from cost savings in previous years,
amounted to Pounds 12.3m (Pounds 300,000 loss). Overseas profits, with gains
in the US, continental Europe, Africa and Australasia, increased from Pounds
27.1m to Pounds 29.2m.
The main engines for growth were the housing market recoveries in the UK and
US and the continuing strong demand for homes in Germany. Volume sales of
tiles, concrete blocks and bricks rose sharply on both sides of the Atlantic
although price competition has remained intense.
Since December the group has raised prices of clay and concrete products by
between 5 and 7 per cent.
About 60 per cent of turnover now comes from higher margin plastic products
for the building and automotive industries.
COMMENT
Some Pounds 30m was taken out of costs by Marley during 1991 and 1992 and
the company is now reaping the benefits as its main markets start to
recover. Price rises could add another Pounds 5m to profits even if volumes
stand still. Clay and concrete sales in the UK rose by about 5 per cent in
the first 10 weeks of this year. The recovery in the US, meanwhile,
continues to run ahead of that in the UK. Political developments in South
Africa, which accounts for about 10 per cent of profits, however, could
cause a problem. Profits this year could reach Pounds 45m, putting the group
on a prospective p/e of more than 18, which suggests that its virtues are
well known and already in the share price.

FT  17 MAR 94 / UK Company News: GrandMet and Brent Walker off to court
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Grand Metropolitan is taking Brent Walker and William Hill to court in an
attempt to clarify an aspect of the September 1989 agreement between them,
under which GrandMet sold its betting shops business for Pounds 685m.
The legal proceedings look set to regenerate a bitter dispute between the
two companies over the deal. The purchase of William Hill and Mecca
Bookmakers from GrandMet, and the debt taken on to effect it, proved the
final straw for Brent Walker, the leisure and property group, which was
already overburdened with borrowings.
A year after the purchase went through, Brent Walker was tipped into the
financial crisis from which it has never recovered. Brent Walker has been
attempting to reclaim Pounds 200m of the purchase price from GrandMet since
1990, saying that profits of the business were not up to the promised level.
Brent Walker, which finalised a financial restructuring in March 1992 but
has since met further problems, only refinanced the Pounds 375m William Hill
loan at the beginning of this month. The timing of GrandMet's move suggests
it was waiting for the refinancing before proceeding.
The disagreement between the two companies over the purchase price had gone
to independent arbitration, but as yet no conclusion has been reached.
In its statement Brent Walker said GrandMet was 'seeking rectification of
certain clauses of the agreement'. These are thought not to relate to more
than half the value of Brent Walker's claim.
GrandMet said that originally both sides had interpreted one aspect of the
agreement the same way. However, in the last 18 months or so, it asserted,
Brent Walker had changed its interpretation of the agreement. GrandMet said
it was going to court so the question of how to interpret the clauses could
be settled by a judge.
Brent Walker never paid the final Pounds 50m instalment due to GrandMet in
September 1990. GrandMet sued Brent Walker for the payment and the court
ordered Brent Walker to pay. However, the amount due is still rolling up
interest and GrandMet has not received it.

FT  17 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Westland order prospects under fire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GKN yesterday accused Westland, the helicopter manufacturer, of inflating
its order prospects in an attempt to fight off a Pounds 497m hostile
takeover bid by the engineering and industrial services group.
Sir David Lees, GKN chairman, claimed the Yeovil-based manufacturer was
trying to win shareholder support by laying claim to future sales which
could prove illusory.
In what he admitted was a more robust approach to the takeover, Sir David
described Westland's firm order book as 'unremarkable and unexciting'.
Writing to the group's shareholders, he warned: 'Prospects in the past have
failed repeatedly to turn into orders.'
He cited unfulfilled hopes for previous helicopters, such as the Westland
W30 and Black Hawk, as examples of the group's 'uncertain business
judgment'.
Westland has so far rejected GKN's offer of 290p per ordinary share,
claiming it undervalues its Pounds 1.4bn order book and the potential of its
flagship helicopter - the EH101.
Mr Alan Jones, Westland chairman, said the company's share price - unchanged
yesterday at 326p - reflected market sentiment about the offer.
'GKN's tone has turned arrogant. Why should my shareholders kow-tow to his
protestations that 290p is a good offer?'
Sir David, however, claimed the price increase had been driven by bid
speculation rather than the underlying value of the helicopter business.
'Until speculation started at the end of November, the Westland share price
traded in a range of between 210p and 250p. This is consistent with GKN's
view of Westland's value as a stand-alone business.'
GKN, which has promised logistical, marketing and financial support for the
helicopter group, said Mr Jones had refused to meet Sir David to discuss the
offer. 'A meeting would not have resolved anything unless there was a
substantially increased offer on the table,' according to the Westland
chairman.
Both companies have now begun courting institutional investors in an effort
to win their support.
They are expected to concentrate on M&amp;G and Schroders, which control a
combined 9.5 per cent in GKN and more than 25 per cent of Westland.

FT  17 MAR 94 / UK Company News: British Mohair blames decline on yarn side
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
British Mohair Holdings, the Bradford-based yarn and specialised engineering
products maker, reported a fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 2.1m to
Pounds 1.47m for the year to December 31.
The reduction was largely because of a decline in demand for yarn in the
second half, the company said, although the non-textile companies marginally
increased profits. However, early indications of demand for mohair yarns
showed some improvement and raw material prices had risen.
Turnover was little changed at Pounds 39.3m (Pounds 39.2m).
A maintained final dividend of 7.1p is proposed to hold the total at 8.5p,
uncovered by earnings of 7.39p (10.8p).

FT  17 MAR 94 / Coats remains cautious on its main markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Neville Bain, chief executive of Coats Viyella, the UK's largest clothing
and textiles company, warned yesterday that 'there are no immediate signs of
significant improvement in external conditions in our major markets'.
The alert came as the company posted a fall in underlying operating profits
of 3.6 per cent to Pounds 187.6m. With Pounds 21.2m (Pounds 9.7m) of
exceptional gains, mostly on property sales, pre-tax profits for 1993 rose
to Pounds 150.3m, against Pounds 134.7m. This represents an 11.6 per cent
improvement when adjusted for exchange rate fluctuations and acquisitions.
Earnings per share rose to 14.6p, from 10p, and a final dividend of 4.75p
makes a total of 8p, up from 7.25p.
The company again intends to offer an enhanced scrip dividend to recover
some of its advanced corporation tax (ACT). Mr Bain conceded that some
shareholders did not like enhanced scrip dividends because they increased
the number of shares in issue. He said the tactic was not a permanent
feature.
Coats would keep about Pounds 35m in cash as a result of the enhanced scrip,
of which Pounds 23m would be earmarked for investment in China, eastern
Europe and north America.
Gearing fell sharply from 64.6 to 31 per cent, the lowest level since before
the Pounds 252m acquisition of Tootal three years ago. Mr Russell Walls,
finance director, said: 'We have digested Tootal.' The reduction followed
the conversion of Pounds 122.4m of redeemable preference shares to equity.
Net year-end borrowings fell from Pounds 404.8m to Pounds 266.3m.
By geographical area, Coats recorded lower sales in north and south America
and in Europe, outside the UK. The slowdown was partly the result of a trend
in men's fashions away from knitwear, said Mr Bain. Operating profits in
continental Europe fell 32.3 per cent to Pounds 31.2m.
Cost-cutting led to operating profit improvements in the Americas. Brazil,
which has been a persistent loss-maker for the company, recorded a loss of
Pounds 5m, compared with Pounds 15m in 1992.
Acquisitions contributed sales of Pounds 200m and earnings after taxes and
minority payments of Pounds 8.2m, adding 1p to the earnings per share
figure.

FT  17 MAR 94 / Schroders reveals Pounds 102m inner reserves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Schroders, the merchant bank, yesterday revealed for the first time that it
has been carrying Pounds 101.6m in inner reserves on its books and said
pre-tax profits rose 85 per cent in 1993.
Pre-tax profits rose to Pounds 195.8m, from Pounds 105.7m. The inclusion of
the inner reserves forced Schroders to restate its 1992 earnings, raising
them slightly.
Of 1993 profits, the fund management arm contributed 29 per cent of the
total, Pounds 56.8m, up from Pounds 30.2m in 1992. Meanwhile, merchant and
investment banking earned Pounds 139m, up from Pounds 75.5m.
Despite the sharp rise in revenues, administrative expenses rose 20 per cent
to Pounds 272m, most of which reflected increases in salaries and bonuses.
Mr Win Bischoff, group chief executive, said Pounds 15m to Pounds 20m had
been set aside to cover bonuses for 1993.
There was a 50 per cent increase in the 1993 dividend to 16.5p per share.
Earnings per share were 109.2p against 54.6p.
Schroders, like other European merchant banks, is being forced by an EU
directive to detail hidden reserves, traditionally used to smooth profits
over the years, and to break down the source of revenues into trading
activities and that earned on fees and commissions. 'The hemline is lifted a
little bit higher than has been the case in other years,' said Mr George
Mallinckrodt, chairman.
Analysts point to strong growth in Schroder Investment Management, the fund
management division. Total assets under management rose 47 per cent to
Pounds 53bn, about 40 per cent of which was outside Britain.
Net new cash in 1993 totalled Pounds 6.5bn, a rise of about 15 per cent of
1992 total funds under management, with Pounds 2.7bn of that coming from UK
pension funds. Schroders has had particular success in attracting US pension
fund assets and is now the largest foreign manager of foreign equities for
US institutions. Moreover, since the start of this year, SIM has attracted
some Pounds 2bn in new cash.
By comparison, Schroders' profits from trading were roughly 13 per cent of
the total. This is far below its contribution to other merchant banks which,
owing to strong market performance in 1993, earned 25 to 30 per cent of
profits from trading. Mr Mallinckrodt said the mix of profits reflected the
strategy of concentrating on fee-based businesses rather than
capital-intensive activities.

FT  17 MAR 94 / Sheikh buys Nordic oil group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The Nordic region's biggest oil refining group, OK Petroleum, was yesterday
sold to Sheikh Mohammed Al-Amoudi, a Saudi Arabian businessman, for Dollars
1.2bn (Pounds 820m) including debt.
The deal illustrates a growing trend for state-owned oil companies from
petroleum exporting countries to buy downstream assets in Europe, Asia and
the US. But the OK sale is being carried out through a private company,
Corral Petroleum Holdings.
Equity proceeds of Dollars 750m will be split between OK's three owners: the
Swedish state (24 per cent), the KF co-operative group (52 per cent) and
Neste, the Finnish oil company (24 per cent). The sale furthers the Swedish
government's privatisation programme and allows KF and Neste to concentrate
on core and majority-owned businesses. Kleinwort Benson acted for all three
sellers.
The Saudi link should provide the group with strong financial backing for
further investment. 'Our intention is that OK Petroleum should grow within
its current area of operation,' said Mr Ghazi Habib, who will represent the
sheikh on the OK board. Mr Habib is a former head of Samarec, the Saudi
refining and crude marketing company which was merged with Saudi Aramco last
year.
OK, which will retain its Swedish base and management has two refineries on
Sweden's west coast, with a combined refining capacity of 265,000 barrels a
day. It accounts for 23 per cent of the Nordic refining capacity, and around
60 per cent of output is exported.
The deal also includes storage facilities, ownership stakes in several
hundred retailing outlets and some upstream operations. It excludes around
650 OK petrol stations which are owned independently.
OK Petroleum was founded in 1986 by a consortium including Neste. Last year
net profits rose to SKr552m (Pounds 47m) from SKr41m while sales increased
to SKr19.5bn from SKr16.0bn.
Sheik Al-Amoudi, a member of a merchant family from Jeddah, has not
previously been involved in the oil industry, although he has had business
dealings in Sweden for more than 20 years, including involvement with the
construction company ABV.
Mr Alan Marshall, oil analyst with Swiss Bank Corp in London, said he
expected that the buyers would use OK Petroleum to build market share in
Scandinavia and Europe. 'This will make life tougher for established
players,' he predicted.

FT  17 MAR 94 / Cash gets through political bars: Rapid changes in smaller
European telecoms markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An odd pattern is emerging in Europe's telecommunications industry. While
the larger continental EU states dither, the smaller ones are rushing to
restructure and sell off their public telecoms operators.
The Greek socialist government announced this month its intention to sell a
25 per cent stake in its public telecoms operator or PTO. On the same day
the Irish PTO publicised an offer from Cable &amp; Wireless, the UK telecoms
group, for a strategic partnership - short of privatisation, but a first
step on the way.
Denmark and the Netherlands are well advanced on the privatisation trail,
while the Portuguese government is restructuring and valuing its telecoms
operators. The Belgium PTO and telecoms ministry are deep in talks about a
sell-off, with British Telecommunications touted as a possible partner.
The pattern is odd because privatisation usually goes hand-in-hand with
liberalisation, yet ostensibly smaller EU states are under less pressure
than larger ones to liberalise telecoms.
While the rest of the EU (besides Spain) must allow competition in basic
voice services by 1998, Greece, Ireland and Portugal need not do it until
2003. Furthermore, most of the smaller states have left-wing or centre-left
coalitions whose trade union allies are fiercely opposed to privatisation of
their PTOs.
Greece is the starkest case: the socialists, under Mr Andreas Papandreou,
won an election last year promising to scrap the previous right-wing
government's privatisation plans. But they have revived them, only reducing
the proportion of OTE, the Greek PTO, to be sold from 49 to 25 per cent.
By contrast, the right-wing French government has put the privatisation of
France Telecom on the back-burner. Legislation to privatise Deutsche Telekom
is advancing at a snail's pace and Italy is far from proceeding with a sale
of its various state-owned telecoms operators.
In reality, fiscal and business pressures are dictating policy, irrespective
of party programmes and Brussels derogations. Three acute pressures are
evident among the PTOs in the smaller states: network modernisation,
shortage of cash, and internationalisation.
Not that all the smaller EU states have backward telecoms networks. Ireland
and Portugal have fewer lines per head than the average, but Denmark is at
the top of the EU league and the Netherlands third behind France.
However, for most of the smaller states the challenge is to ensure adequate
funding and know-how to keep up with the pack. Belgium, for instance, has an
adequate network, but not good enough to match its ambition of becoming
Europe's telecoms hub. In mobile communications, Belgacom, the state
operator, first brought in Pacific Telesis, the US regional Bell operator,
to help build a cellular mobile network. Now Belgacom is establishing a
mobile subsidiary in which Pactel is likely to take a 25 per cent stake. 'In
effect this is a dry run for privatisation,' says a consultant close to the
company.
If know-how were the only requirement, modernisation need not require
privatisation. But modernisation needs investment too.
With state deficits piling up, PTOs are looking to privatisation to fund
investment. Telecom Eireann, for instance, has a respectable network, but
with debts approaching IPounds 1bn (Pounds 960m) the attractions of a deal
with Cable &amp; Wireless, reported to be worth up to IPounds 500m, are obvious.
However, governments want privatisation proceeds to alleviate budget
deficits. In Greece a row has erupted between the government and OTE over
the division of the estimated Dollars 1bn proceeds. Ministers want 60 per
cent to go into state coffers; OTE wants 60 per cent for network investment.
Internationalisation is equally pressing. Smaller PTOs fear multinationals
will steal lucrative business customers. They believe they cannot afford to
wait to form alliances. For many, last year's Dollars 5.3bn alliance between
BT and MCI, the second-largest US carrier, was the moment of truth.
PTOs need not be privatised to form alliances, but that way they are more
attractive to potential allies, most of whom are private concerns. Mr David
Wheeler, director of the telecoms group at Lehman Brothers, the merchant
bank, says: 'In the smaller states, it is much easier to persuade PTOs and
their ministers that they cannot survive globalisation without the
flexibility that privatisation gives to forge alliances and stay in the
international telecoms game.'
It is not a foregone conclusion that all alliances will be permitted. Mr
Philip Lowe, head of the EU's merger task force, said this week that the
commission intended to police telecoms joint ventures closely to ensure
competition did not suffer.
However, competition is driving the alliances. The EU obligation on PTOs to
make leased-lines available upon request is already giving large customers
and companies dedicated to line resale the opportunity to side-step PTOs and
their high international tariffs.
The competitive threat is particularly strong in Ireland, where Telecom
Eireann faces a haemorrhage of its international traffic to re-sellers.
Ironically, the largest of them is Cable &amp; Wireless. If you can't beat 'em
 .

FT  17 MAR 94 / French shipbuilder to bid for Swan Hunter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Constructions Mecaniques de Normandie, the French-based shipbuilder, said
yesterday it would make a bid within a week for Swan Hunter, the Tyneside
shipbuilder in receivership since May.
The bid is likely to be conditional on the yard winning the Ministry of
Defence contract for the refit of the landing ship Sir Bedivere. CMN said
its bid for Swan Hunter would be made before Thursday March 24, the deadline
for submission of tenders to the MoD for the Sir Bedivere contract.
Price Waterhouse, Swan Hunter's receivers, was optimistic it would receive a
bid for the company, possibly but not necessarily from CMN, before the
tender deadline.
The receivers expect any bid will be conditional on Swan Hunter winning the
Sir Bedivere refit, which again pins the survival of north-east England's
last shipbuilder on the award of a keenly contested MoD contract.
It was Swan Hunter's failure to win a vital MoD helicopter carrier order,
after it bid Pounds 71m more than a rival VSEL-Kvaerner Govan consortium,
which plunged the Tyneside company into receivership.
The 18-month Sir Bedivere refit, worth about Pounds 30m, will provoke
another fierce fight. Tenders have been invited from Swan Hunter, VSEL,
Yarrow, the Devonport and Rosyth naval dockyards, Appledore and Tees
Dockyard.
Yesterday Mr Ed James, joint receiver, said: 'We are accepting the award of
the Sir Bedivere to Swan's is likely to be a condition of any bid to buy the
company.'
He said Swan Hunter was formulating the 'most competitive and compliant' bid
possible. Since receivership, the company has cut overheads, shedding nearly
1,500 jobs. Swan Hunter's tender must be underwritten by a prospective
purchaser guaranteeing completion to cost and on time.
Mr Fred Henderson, leader of the CMN bid team, said: 'We would expect to be
submitting a bid prior to the closing date for the Sir Bedivere tender.' He
is aiming for early next week. 'It's all going to be last-ditch stuff.'
Swan Hunter's current workload is two frigates to be handed over in May and
November. Without Sir Bedivere, the company would be 'very unattractive',
said Mr Henderson. CMN is still considering whether to make its bid
conditional on winning the refit.

FT  17 MAR 94 / Hurd supports EU expansion: UK studies compromise deals for
dispute over blocking veto
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK government made clear last night that it would not allow the dispute
over its blocking veto to jeopardise the enlargement of the European Union.
Hoping to unite the party behind a compromise, Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign
secretary, told Conservative MPs at a meeting of the backbench foreign
affairs committee that he was not prepared to see enlargement fail.
He said that was a policy in Britain's national interests that had been
strongly supported by Mr John Major and Mrs Margaret Thatcher.
Ministers are still fighting to prevent the number of votes needed to block
legislation from rising from 23 to 27. Mr Hurd is believed to have told
backbenchers that '23 is best'.
But he is understood to have made equally clear that he is worried that any
delay to agreement might jeopardise enlargement. Ministers hope to reach a
compromise at a further meeting of European foreign ministers next Tuesday.
Britain's 'incomprehensible insistence on an obsolete set of rules', was
criticised yesterday by Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, the Danish prime minister.
London was Denmark's closest ally when Copenhagen sought opt-outs from the
Maastricht treaty.
Without a compromise by Britain and Spain, which have been opposing the
proposal to increase the number of votes required to block decisions,
Sweden, Finland, Austria and Norway will be unable to join the EU by next
January.
Mr Hurd was careful not to reveal his negotiating hand to Tory MPs, who
applauded him.
Ministers believe a formula put forward by Spain 'is a possible way
forward'. Under its terms, the blocking vote would rise to 27 once the new
members join the EU, while maintaining a further blocking vote at 23
provided a maximum of three countries made up the 23 votes.
That would keep the status quo intact and allow two large EU members and one
small one  - with a combined population of at least 100m  - to block
decisions by the EU Council of Ministers.
However, Mr Hurd's difficulty in finding a compromise acceptable to the
Euro-sceptics was highlighted by comments made earlier in the day by Mr
William Cash, a leading Euro-sceptic.
He warned the government against making 'an attempt to sell a cosmetic
exercise' to the Commons.
The government plans to bring forward legislation to the Commons in the
autumn if there is agreement on enlargement.

FT  17 MAR 94 / France forces retreat on fish prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A late-night French threat to block Norway's entry into the European Union
produced a rapid pay-off for Paris early yesterday with Brussels announcing
a two-month extension of minimum prices for fish imported into the EU.
France's strong-arm tactics forced a U-turn by the European Commission which
24 hours earlier had refused to extend crisis measures to prop up fish
prices.
The Commission's retreat will upset fish exporters in the US and eastern
Europe, but offers a breathing space to the French government, which has
struggled to contain violent protests by its fishermen against cheap
imports.
Mr Alain Lamassoure, French minister for European affairs, said he had
intervened with Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission,
during a marathon negotiating session on Norwegian accession to the EU which
ended early yesterday.
'I made it quite clear this was a condition for our agreement to Norwegian
membership, and especially on the fish arrangements with Norway,' he said.
The French threat succeeded, and shortly before midnight Norway and the EU
reached agreement on fishing rights.
A final accord on the terms of entry for Sweden, Finland, Austria and Norway
remains elusive, however, because of Anglo-Spanish objections to
power-sharing arrangements in an expanded union.
Minimum import prices will apply to imports of cod, haddock, hake, angler,
coley, Alaskan pollack and salmon.
The decision to extend minimum import prices will come into effect this week
and apply until May 17. It will be reviewed at a meeting of European Union
fisheries ministers in Luxembourg on April 12.

FT  17 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Porsche
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
With its heavy dependence on US sales, Porsche led the pack into the great
German car industry pile-up. The fall in US sales  - down by almost 75 per
cent from the 1986 peak  - meant that Porsche had to adjust much faster than
those German carmakers which boomed as Trabants were swapped for Golfs after
German unification. The early attack on costs has left Porsche better placed
than some larger German car companies. Porsche was also fortunate that some
944 model manufacturing was subcontracted to Audi. When demand slumped
Porsche lost the incremental profit on sales volumes, but was not stuck with
the associated overheads.
Since costs have now been cut to at least break-even, and the new 911 model
is selling well, the company has bought itself a breathing space. The rights
issue will help develop the two new models  - a new 911 and a cheaper
two-seater 986 convertible  - which must take up the running from 1996-97.
The issue now is whether in the longer term the Porsche and Piech family
control can be maintained.
Continued investment in engine and gearbox technology means Porsche does not
face the severe development cost crunch which is forcing other specialist
manufacturers into defensive mergers. Joint purchasing of parts with other
German carmakers also eases Porsche's cost problems. The new models may be
priced at only a modest premium to Japanese competition. In that case the
strong brand and evolutionary design development may serve Porsche well
against those manufacturers which reinvent the wheel every time they launch
a new model.

FT  17 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Coats Viyella
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Coats Viyella's longer-term attractions emerge undimmed from the deluge of
data accompanying its annual results. The company has restructured its
businesses during recession and positioned itself well to exploit
fast-growing emerging markets. Recent acquisitions have performed
encouragingly. With gearing cut to 31 per cent, the balance sheet remains
strong enough to permit more.
But Coats' suggestion that the economic outlook was only faintly encouraging
was enough to knock 7 per cent off its shares. Coats believes UK tax rises
will dent confidence more than most assume. Rising cotton prices could also
prove difficult to pass on to retailers, implying some margin squeeze. That
suggests the 3.6 per cent fall in underlying operating profits may not
easily be reversed  - especially as currency effects will be less favourable
this year.
The market may also be tiring of Coats' habit of paying paper dividends.
Coats certainly has a better case to make than most with almost Pounds 100m
of unrelieved advance corporation tax. This time, Coats will retain Pounds
35m of cash, which it has earmarked for worthy investments. But two previous
enhanced scrip dividends and the conversion of preference shares have
expanded Coats' equity base by 16 per cent since 1992. The latest scrip
payment may add a further 2 per cent. It may be easy to lift the dividend 10
per cent when Coats does not have to pay. But it will become painful when
Coats starts paying hard cash on so many more shares.

FT  17 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Schroders
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Now that Schroders has taken the plunge on disclosure it turns out that the
company does indeed have much to boast about. Not only did profits rise 85
per cent last year; the quality is good too. Schroders is much less reliant
than some of its competitors on dealing income. Fee income accounts for
almost two-thirds of operating income. Schroders has been continuing to win
new fund management business since the start of the year. That should help
offset any fall in its income caused by weakness in financial markets. There
must be more venture capital gains in the pipeline, although the timing is
uncertain.
Even without any increase in profits, Schroders would be on a forward
multiple of less than 11 times. If that makes the shares seem good value,
one is left agape at the 6.6 times dividend cover. There is clearly minimal
constraint on dividend progression.
But such high earnings retentions when the company already has surplus
capital are where the strategic questions begin. A 23 per cent return on
capital might seem low at this stage in the cycle, though Schroders is
barely geared and its profits are less volatile than those of other merchant
banks. Arguably Schroders missed an opportunity to enhance its return by
buying back its own shares when the price was cheaper. It cannot accumulate
capital for ever. The worry is that it may do something just to ease the
discomfort. However, it has a record of getting the strategic decisions
right.

FT  17 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Gilts pay the price
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is a measure of the heightened sensitivity of bond markets that
yesterday's mixed bag of UK economic statistics sent gilts into a spin. An
unexpected rise in average earnings was the culprit. But since there is no
sign of upward drift in pay settlements it would be premature to diagnose
the return of the British disease. Year-end bonuses and overtime may be the
less threatening explanation, in which case yesterday's rise in gilt yields
was overdone.
There was certainly nothing in the labour market data to suggest that
workers have employers over a barrel. Employment in manufacturing, where
average earnings growth was strongest, actually fell in the final quarter of
last year. Productivity improvements continue to flow through in an
encouraging manner. While the fall in headline unemployment must be a relief
to the government after January's disappointment, there are still lingering
doubts about how many full-time jobs are being created.
Together with weak retail sales in February, that doubt might incline the
chancellor more strongly towards another cut in interest rates before tax
increases take effect next month. Good news on retail prices next week could
provide the peg. The danger must be that another rate cut will fray nerves
about inflation in the gilts market and bring forward the moment when rates
will have to rise. Since the yield on 10-year gilts is already 115 basis
points above German bunds, UK bonds already look good value. Unless
investors come round to this point of view, funding next year's borrowing
requirement could prove tricky.

FT  17 MAR 94 / France forces Brussels retreat on fish prices
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A late-night French threat to block Norway's entry into the European Union
produced a rapid pay-off for Paris early yesterday with Brussels announcing
a two-month extension of minimum prices for fish imported into the EU.
France's strongarm tactics forced a U-turn by the European Commission which
24 hours earlier had refused to extend crisis measures to prop up fish
prices.
The Commission's retreat will upset fish exporters in the US and eastern
Europe but offers a breathing space to the French government, which has
struggled to contain violent protests by its fishermen against cheap
imports.
Mr Alain Lamassoure, French minister for European affairs, said he had
intervened with Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission,
during a marathon negotiating session on Norwegian accession to the EU which
ended early yesterday. 'I made it quite clear this was a condition for our
agreement to Norwegian membership, and especially on the fish arrangements
with Norway.'
The French threat was successful, and shortly before midnight Norway and the
EU reached agreement on fishing rights. But a final accord on the terms of
entry for Sweden, Finland, Austria and Norway remains elusive because of
Anglo-Spanish objections to power-sharing arrangements in an expanded Union.
Minimum import prices will apply to imports of cod, haddock, hake, angler,
coley, Alaskan pollack and salmon.
The crisis measures are identical to those imposed a year ago when Breton
fishermen ransacked warehouses and orchestrated a shutdown of French ports.
Two months ago, minimum prices were restored after Breton fishermen burned
down their historic parliament building in Rennes.
A Commission official said the discussions had also considered British and
Dutch concerns about cheap imports from eastern Europe which were entering
the EU via Sweden. Also, fresh data showed EU fish prices for cod, one of
the most important fish species, continued to fall in 10 member states last
month.
The decision to extend minimum import prices will come into effect this week
and apply until May 17. The move will be reviewed at a meeting of EU
fisheries ministers on April 12.
Separately, the French government has introduced delayed inspection of US
fish exports, prompting protests from Washington. It has also launched a
FFr10m (Dollars 1.7m) advertising campaign to persuade consumers to eat more
fish, a promotion funded partly by the EU.

FT  17 MAR 94 / Personal View: Citizen's Charter  - half-way there
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM WALDEGRAVE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The FT's audit of the Citizen's Charter on Monday damned it with faint
praise. 'Not all objectives achieved.' The glass half empty. Three years
into a 10-year programme it would have been as easy  - and fairer  - to
argue the other way. 'Real, measurable progress made.' Glass half full.
Yes, the Citizen's Charter programme is ambitious. That is why it is being
studied by governments across the world. The prime minister's aim is to
change the face of the public service; to give those who provide it new
pride; to give those who pay for it quality performance; to give those who
use it the satisfaction that comes from services that offer what they want,
when they want and how they want.
Your article made the common mistake of equating the charter with the
charter documents themselves. It is far wider than that. The documents are
only part of the story, one means to the common end of wider choice, higher
standards and new ideas. This wider programme is about competition and
choice. It covers privatisation and contracting out  - putting private
sector skills and ideas at the service of the public  - just as much as
devising mechanisms to improve performance where the service remains in the
public sector.
Before the charter, the FT could not have published an article listing the
published objectives of, and seeking to measure performance in, the public
sector. There simply was no published information about service standards by
which to judge.
Now all that is changing. Publication of league tables for schools gives
parents the knowledge to use their power to choose. Railtrack results are in
the stations. Waiting lists are visibly down. Hospital performance
indicators are on the way. This is truly a revolution.
The main charters explained to users what the public is entitled to expect.
But others act as 'models' which will guide those writing local charters of
service for colleges and council departments and many many others. The local
charters will be expected in every case to contain testable performance
measures.
On independent audit, the FT article is just plain wrong. There is
independent audit of schools by the new Ofsted. For the first time ever
every school in the country will be regularly inspected and challenged to
improve, and reports will go to every parent.
In the health service and local authorities we have given the Audit
Commission powers to publish performance tables of results for other local
services, not just schools. Increasingly, charters are being used to measure
organisations' performance. The parliamentary ombudsman has said that he
finds charter standards a useful guide and in one major case used it to get
improved redress for a class of victims of maladministration.
As for independent review of complaints, three years ago it would have been
thought extraordinary for organisations such as the Inland Revenue, the Home
Office's immigration and nationality department or the prison service to
provide this. Now those organisations are setting the trend and other  -
less well known  - public service organisations are appointing independent
adjudicators to whom people can take their complaints.
Have Charters raised standards? There is real evidence that they have. The
charts (left)  - just examples  - tell their own story.
Of course, with a reform programme that affects the whole of the public
service  - employing 5m people and with every one of us a customer  - there
is plenty more to do. That is why the Citizen's Charter second report,
published yesterday, contains a full agenda of further improvements. And why
we have also published a widely available booklet, 'Report Back 94', which
sets out commitments and future plans in key services.
We have always said that this is a 10-year programme. But it is clear that
in less than three years the charter has begun to change the attitudes and
culture of public service organisations. I believe the glass is half full,
and filling rapidly.

FT  17 MAR 94 / Lid for a bubbling cauldron: Under a separatist president,
Crimea's economic and political tensions are mounting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Crimean Peninsula  - a region of Ukraine, dominated by Russians  - is
one of the world's new danger zones since the recent election of a president
who appeared to promise it would again be part of Russia. The CIA sees it as
one of the main threats to Russian-Ukrainian relations and Mr Zbigniew
Brzezinski, the former US national security adviser, has said in an article
that it is 'on the verge of an ethnic explosion'.
This impression was confirmed this week, when Mr Yuri Meshkov, the
president, said he would go ahead with a March 27 'opinion poll' on
broadening the region's autonomy  - expected to be a prelude to a closer
relationship with Russia, if not full unity. President Leonid Kravchuk of
Ukraine annulled the 'poll' on Tuesday night, saying it was a referendum
under another name and thus illegal under the constitution: Mr Meshkov
insists it will go ahead.
The reality is alarming, but those who occupy the centre of the Crimean
stage mock the warnings of disaster and insinuate that a deal is possible
which would bring stability. Its conditions and structure will be important
not just for the peninsula, but also for many of the areas in which 25m
Russians live outside their motherland  - a diaspora constituting one of the
greatest challenges to post-Soviet peace.
Mr Meshkov, in his late 40s, uses the stump politician's passion to
excoriate the world for misunderstanding him. He is not an extremist but a
moderate, an anti-Communist and a reformer, he said in the Supreme Soviet
(parliament) building in the capital, Simferopol.
But will he hold the referendum he promised on the status of the republic  -
a device to achieve a vote for union with Russia? He evades, talks about the
need for economic stability, and finally says that 'the people are not
concerned with a referendum'. It seems as close to an admission as it is
possible to get that his election referendum pledge will be delayed: his
announcement of an 'opinion poll' is a modified version, not binding on him
or the government.
Others around him are more explicit. Mr Yevgeny Saburov, a former Russian
economics minister, has been tempted back to his native Crimea from Moscow
on what he says is a sixth of his salary as a presidential adviser to plan
the economic future of his region. Mr Saburov, grinning slyly from behind
his pipe, says: 'The longer the referendum is delayed, the better it will be
for the economy . . . The important thing is the standard of living. But any
attempts to isolate Crimea from Russia would mean the strongest opposition
here . . . if Ukrainianisation continues, then of course people will vote
for joining Russia.'
This appears to be a full consensus. What is on offer to President Kravchuk
is a deal under which Crimea is allowed to go entirely its own way, in
return for which it will allow itself to be governed, titularily, by Kiev.
If, as expected, the opinion poll yields a large majority for greater
autonomy, Mr Meshkov can be expected to claim a mandate for virtual economic
independence. To adapt the old Soviet joke, the deal is: they pretend to
rule us, we pretend to obey.
In fact, Ukrainian rule would be a facade. Mr Saburov's fledgling economic
plan is to recognise the dependence of Crimea on Russian markets  -
especially for its agricultural produce  - and to legitimise the use of the
Russian rouble and hard currencies, notably the US dollar. He wants to get
Russian banks into the peninsula ('they are already quietly buying
property') and remove customs borders with Russia. Mr Meshkov and Mr Saburov
would have a Russian republic in all but juridical status.
It is a plan which could avoid the predicted explosion and let a nervous
Europe sleep better. So would it work?
Crimea, privileged because the Soviet elite came here to relax in its
resorts, has suffered disproportionately from the break-up of the Soviet
Union. The inflating currency, the carbovanet, makes transactions a daily
horror; the agricultural exports to Russia incur customs and other
restrictions; and the Ukraine government demands that the shipyards, which
have contracts with Sweden and Greece, change 50 per cent of their hard
currency income at a low rate of exchange  - thus confiscating more than
their entire profits.
Mr Saburov's plan is simple enough. Demolish customs barriers with Russia
and revive trade; allow the foreign currency earners to keep their earnings
(but pay taxes); and levy taxes on the resorts, which pay none. Add to this
foreign businesses and banks: 'I would love them all to come, though I know
they take a long time and I am not counting on it soon.'
With a revived economy, Mr Meshkov and Mr Saburov believe, will come a
contented population. But what of 'ethnic explosions'?
Of the peninsula's 2.7m people, about 70 per cent are Russian. Of the rest,
some 20-25 per cent are Ukrainian and 200,000 are Crimean Tatars.
Ukrainian-Russian relations in Crimea are placid: but the small Ukrainian
political class is disturbed. Mr Igor Banakh, leader of the Ukrainian Civil
Consensus group, blames Mr Kravchuk for letting Crimea out on too long a
leash, and now being unable to pull it back. 'We have to institute the law
here, which says that you don't recognise the election of a Crimean
president. We see from the example of Yugoslavia that you can't ignore such
things.'
The Tatars are a different matter. These were the peninsula's natives, their
khans displaced from rule in the peninsula (under the Turkish empire) only
in the 1780s. During the war, accused of mass betrayal (to the Germans) they
were shipped off to central Asia. Ukraine has sanctioned their return.
Gratitude to Ukraine and distrust of the Russians led most Tatars to follow
the call of their Mejlis, or separate assembly, to vote for the
pro-Ukrainian presidential candidate, Nikolai Bagrov. Now on the losing
side, they fear they will suffer.
Mr Mustafa Jemilev, Mejlis chairman and former dissident, says Mr Meshkov
wants to disenfranchise the Tatars by ending the system of 14 protected
seats in the Supreme Soviet for them. 'If he does that, of course, there
will no more Tatar representatives in the Soviet.'
But politics is not the most serious of the Tatars' problems  - poverty is.
They are utterly dependent on the state; the returnees are given a small
plot of land and some building materials. In one settlement, Molodyezhnoye 5
near Simferopol, 75-year-old Asfore Maileyeva and her daughter-in-law,
Zenia, sit in a breeze-block hut the size of a garden shed which houses a
family of six. She is a testament to the ability to withstand hardship, but
also to her people's desire to return. 'I don't regret coming,' she says.
'Nobody can tell you to move on from here.'
The Tatars have neither the numbers nor the will to fuel an ethnic crisis:
the more explosive issue is that of ownership of the Black Sea Fleet, based
in the old and still, in parts, noble port of Sevastopol. This fleet has
been a political tug of war since the collapse of the Soviet Union, and
remains so. Captain Andrei Grachev, the fleet's spokesman, does not disguise
his contempt for the separate fleet being built up by the Ukrainians ('five
admirals and four ships') and is happy to say that Admiral Eduard Baltin,
the Russian commander of the fleet, has barred the employment of Ukrainian
naval officers because they have taken an oath to a foreign state  - even
though the fleet is supposed to be joint Russian-Ukrainian property.
For his part, Vice-Admiral Volodomir Bezkorovainiy, commander of the
diminutive Ukrainian navy, insists that the accord reached between
Presidents Kravchuk and Boris Yeltsin of Russia last September, under which
Ukraine would return its half of the fleet and lease Sevastopol to Russia,
is now null, and that the question of how to divide the fleet still has to
be resolved. He bases this view on the failure of experts on both sides to
agree on the details of the fleet's transfer to Russia.
The Russians, who have so far prevented the build-up of a powerful military
force in any of the former Soviet republics, are unlikely to give way: the
Ukrainians cannot.
What, then, are the chances for a peaceful resolution of the Crimean
dilemma? On his recent trip to the US, Mr Kravchuk said privately that he
would never allow the circulation of the rouble in Crimea  - but that he
knew well how to negotiate with the Russians and he did not expect anything
like an explosion. To be sure, this apparently most fissiparous of
relationships retains its curious character: logically alarming, but
actually placid. The new leaders of the Crimea, perhaps in collusion with
Kiev, assume that the logic will remain in limbo.

Turning the other cheek has gone out of fashion, even on the piste.
MasterSun  - which describes itself as a Christian ski organisation  - has
complained to the Advertising Standards Authority that a competing Christian
ski company, Westfleet Services, has allegedly been economical with number 9
of the 10 commandments.
The ASA has criticised Westfleet for advertising 'all-in' ski holiday prices
which actually turned out to exclude ski hire, boot hire and insurance.
MasterSun also took exception to Westfleet's slogan: 'The only Christian ski
organisation providing you with a snow guarantee.' MasterSun says it
provides a guarantee, too. God is omnipotent, after all.

The trains might not yet be running on time but at least the uniforms will
soon be ready. European Passenger Services, which will run Eurostar trains
through the Channel tunnel, has signed up Pierre Balmain to create its new
uniforms.
The airline-style togs are in the Eurostar colours of blue and yellow and
will be worn by everybody from drivers to receptionists. Pierre Balmain is
one of the grand old names of French couture but has been living on its past
glories in recent years, according to Observer's fashion expert.
Will it be any more successful than royal couturier Hardy Amies's mission to
smarten up British Rail's porters in the 1980s? Designing the uniforms is
the easy bit. Getting the lower ranks to adhere to the correct dress code
may be a mite more difficult.

IBM boss Lou Gerstner shook a few trees last July by saying 'the last thing
IBM needs right now is a vision'. Now he is moaning in IBM's annual report
that many extracts from his statement omitted the words 'right now'. Can he
be suggesting that while IBM didn't need a vision then, it does now?
'The fact is, no company is going to succeed without a clear set of
tough-minded strategies,' says Gerstner. 'Some call it mission. Some call it
vision. I call it strategy.' In his new 'IBM Principles', contained in the
annual report, Gerstner says IBM will 'never lose sight of our strategic
vision'.
Some call it inspiration. We call it an about-face, Lou.

Britain's John Major and his Malaysian counterpart, Mahathir Mohamad, may
not get on but they share one feeling  - that they are being hounded
unfairly by the British press.
Indeed, John Major used the 50th anniversary of Canning House in London the
other day to trot out a hardy favourite of persecuted politicians: what
would the headlines say, asked the PM, if he rowed into the middle of the
Serpentine, found himself marooned and walked back over the water to dry
land?
Answer: 'John Major Can't Swim.'

For a fee around Pounds 50,000  - modest enough in British PR terms  -
Wilson will build a zimmer frame to help the TUC clamber forth from the 19th

Remember all those good old anti-communist jokes that flooded out of Poland,
Czechoslovakia and Hungary? In Budapest they're telling one about a
pizzeria, its entrepreneurial owner Zoltan Czvitko and the law. Trouble is,
it's a true story.
Red stars and other communist paraphernalia were officially banned last
year. Czvitko, 30, has responded by opening a pizzeria called Marxim, with
decor best described as commie kitsch  - walls festooned with Soviet
posters, barbed wire, that type of thing.
The cellar boasts a five-pointed star, unfortunately also on the banned
list. The Czvitko defence is that the star is stylised and irregular;
prosecutors will no doubt appear armed with their protractors to measure
angles.

The world's financial markets are in a bit of a tizzy about Easter. Problem
is that Good Friday coincides with the first Friday of the month, when the
US Bureau of Labour Statistics normally puts out its employment figures.
It might be a religious and a bank holiday, but it is not a federal holiday,
so the bureau, despite fierce lobbying from the financial community and even
Congress, reasons that it should publish and be damned. As the numbers are
some of the biggest market-movers in the business, the Chicago futures
exchanges have decided to break with precedent and open some contracts for a
short session.
Not that it was an easy decision. The Chicago Board of Trade has changed its
mind about the proposed holiday three times in a matter of days in a bid to
keep pace with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. To make matters doubly
confusing, the CBOT is still closing an hour earlier than its arch rival,
the Merc. Don't bet they won't think again.

FT  17 MAR 94 / Leading Article: There has to be a better way
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Last weekend's visit to Beijing by Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of
state, was an unmistakable debacle. Arriving with stern warnings that
China's persecution of its dissidents was jeopardising renewal of its most
favoured nation trading status, Mr Christopher was met with a robust refusal
by Chinese leaders to discuss any link between human rights and trade. To
ram home the message, the authorities rounded up a number of their usual
suspects before and during the US envoy's stay. In spite of it all, Mr
Christopher has lamely tried to present a few cosmetic Chinese concessions
as evidence of a 'narrowing of differences' between Washington and Beijing.
If the visit served no other useful purpose, it confirmed what many
observers have suspected ever since President Bill Clinton attached a list
of human rights conditions to a further renewal of China's MFN status, due
by this June: that his administration has landed itself in an embarrassing
bind over trade policy towards China. The risk, unless the issue is handled
with greater care and clarity in the next two months, is that embarrassment
could turn into humiliation or, worse, a trade dispute that will harm both
sides.
Wrong-headed
Mr Clinton's attempt to use trade sanctions to influence China over human
rights fulfilled a campaign promise but was wrong-headed from the start, for
both philosophical and practical reasons. First, it was never likely to
work: Beijing is least likely to give ground when under intense, public
pressure. Second, trade is the wrong weapon. Export-led growth has brought
the population of its southern coastal provinces increasing prosperity and
economic freedom, which may over time bring greater political freedoms in
its wake. Withdrawing MFN would penalise the very same people and give a
great fillip to conservative bureaucrats still sceptical about the merits of
China's opening to the world.
Third, the Clinton administration has muddied the waters with conflicting
signals in its dealings with the Chinese government - investing considerable
effort, for example, in upgrading political relations at the same time as
threatening sanctions to foster political change. In pursuing closer
political contacts, President Clinton is acknowledging that Washington has a
broad range of interests - strategic as well as economic or humanitarian -
to discuss with China. Against that background, the MFN debate seems
curiously out of proportion.
Commercial fall-out
Fourth, it now seems clear, the threat is so severe as to lack credibility.
Withdrawal of MFN would lead to swingeing tariff increases that would harm
other commercial powers of interest to the US - principally Hong Kong - at
least as much as China itself. Chinese retaliation against US exports -
Dollars 9bn last year and growing rapidly - would be inevitable. Beijing
cannot have failed to notice the growing clamour in Washington from US
businessmen anxious about the potential commercial fall-out.
President Clinton thus risks being damned if he does and damned if he
doesn't. If he seeks to renew MFN citing puny human rights concessions, he
may be subject to attack in Congress for caving in. If he chooses not to, he
will face a crisis in America's relations with the world's fastest growing
economy and in his relations with his own business community.
Averting the latter outcome, and preventing any recurrence of the MFN
dilemma, ought now to be the highest priority for the White House.
Fortunately, a way out of the mess is available. This would involve the US
joining with its partners in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to
negotiate speedy Chinese entry on the right terms.
Chinese Gatt membership, with proper safeguards to tackle the specifically
economic problems of integrating a state-dominated trading power into the
world economy, would morally oblige the US to extend MFN status to China
without political conditions. Washington could and should still show strong
concern over human rights in China by political means such as increased
contacts with dissidents and heightened attention to oppressed Tibet. But it
would be better able to do so without an economic gun aimed at its own head
as well as China's.

FT  17 MAR 94 / Leading Article: Banks, deals and dividends
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
For much of the past decade the off-balance sheet liabilities of the
commercial banking system have posed a serious headache for central bankers
engaged in prudential supervision. Now that bank capital in the
English-speaking economies has largely been restored, there may,
paradoxically, be an equal and opposite problem in the form of rapid growth
in off-balance sheet assets and an accumulation of excess capital.
This thought is prompted by the spate of takeovers of mutual fund-based
financial groups in the US. This week has seen a Dollars 2.2bn approach from
GE Capital for the Chicago-based Kemper Corporation. It follows last year's
Dollars 1.7bn takeover of the Dreyfus group by the Mellon Bank. Commercial
banks now control mutual fund assets worth not far short of Dollars 200bn,
compared with a mere Dollars 30bn five years ago.
While GE Capital is not strictly speaking a bank, its reasoning is the same
as that of most other financial institutions buying into mutual funds. The
lending business is relatively mature and its profit potential is becoming
less exciting. In contrast, managing other people's assets is a growth
activity with long term potential. Personal pension and annuity products in
particular look attractive as private individuals take on more of the burden
of pension provision. The volumes of business stand to increase with rising
per capita incomes.
That is not to say that the game of old-fashioned bank intermediation - the
collecting of money from depositors and on-lending it to borrowers - is
dead. If anything it has been making a come-back over the past few days with
four big money centre banks offering no less than Dollars 5bn worth of
finance for the competing offers from Martin Marietta and Northrop for
fellow defence contractor Grumman.
Turning point
The buoyancy of stock markets last year smoothed the way for all-paper bids,
such as the Dollars 6bn offer by Merck, the leading pharmaceuticals firm,
for Medco. But the recent epic battle for Paramount Communications appears
to have marked a turning point. As the bid auction developed the markets
fought shy of the paper of both Viacom and QVC, forcing them to offer cash
as well as stock for Paramount. Since then it has become clear that banks
are falling over each other to finance big corporate deals.
Yet syndicated bank loans for big deals no longer necessarily count as
conventional bank intermediation, because they are often refinanced in paper
and securities markets, thereby removing the assets from the banks' balance
sheets and putting them onto the books of mutual funds and other
institutions.
Shifting risk
The risk here is not that the banks will necessarily run up yet more bad
debts. Neither Northrop nor Martin Marietta could be described as
overborrowed and the concentration of risk will be dispersed in the event of
syndication. The big risks are more likely to be taken at a later point in
the cycle when the market is palpably overheating. The more interesting
question is whether by shifting risk out of the banking system into the
securities markets and onto private individuals, the banks incur fewer bad
debts, generate more stable fee income and end up with excessive capital.
Because it is expensive to service, an excess of capital means commercial
banks lose competitive advantage in intermediation vis a vis the markets.
Historically, it has also tended to burn a hole in bankers' pockets, leading
to injudicious acquisitions and loans. This is, in a sense, a novel
dimension to the banks' longstanding problem in shrinking the more mature
areas of their businesses. The central banks' reluctance to allow
deposit-taking institutions to operate within an open market in corporate
control makes contraction a difficult option, even if some, such as Wells
Fargo in the US or Lloyds in the UK, have demonstrated a greater ability to
retrench than others.
The overwhelming priority for the banks, if their balance sheets do indeed
become burdened with surplus capital, should be to avoid joining the
dealmaking stampede, either as financiers or direct participants, when the
party is turning into a riot. The under-explored virtuous alternative is to
return capital to shareholders in the form of dividends. But can they bring
themselves to do it?

FT  17 MAR 94 / Economic Viewpoint: UK employment and recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One aspect of the much-discussed new flexibility of the UK labour market is
that the jobs figures have become a more useful indicator of general
economic trends than they used to be  - but still not on the basis of a
single month's figures.
Merchants of short-term tidings have made much of the 'bad news' of a rise
in unemployment in January and now of the 'good news' of a fall in February.
But those who have the patience to take a slightly longer view will see that
unemployment has been on a falling trend for a full year and has recently
been declining by an average of 24,000 a month. The vacancy figures provide
some independent corroboration of a tightening in the labour market, having
risen from 120,000 vacancies in February 1993 to 141,000 last month.
Surprise was expressed last year at the fall in unemployment so early in the
recovery because in the past it has lagged well behind the general economy.
In the previous upswing of the early 1980s the unemployment trend did not
turn until nearly four years into the recovery phase.
This time unemployment has shown a decisive and unexpected early improvement
and has done so against the trend in other European countries, where it has
relentlessly deteriorated against a background of international concern
reflected in the Detroit ministerial meeting.
Moreover, the present recovery, at least on the published figures, has been
only moderate. The most frequently cited headline figures, based on overall
gross domestic product, flatter what has occurred. Real UK GDP, excluding
the highly volatile North Sea sector, is estimated to have risen by only 2.2
per cent in the year to the final quarter of 1993. This is no more than the
estimated trend rise in output.
The independent Employment Policy Institute has suggested two special
factors behind the unemployment drop. One is that far fewer young people are
coming on to the labour market, partly for demographic reasons and partly
because more young people are staying on in education. The other is that
employers may have over-reacted to the trauma of Black Wednesday 1992, when
the UK left the exchange rate mechanism, and proceeded to sack workers whom
they afterwards needed.
A recall of workers sacked in a panic is once-for-all and cannot provide the
basis of a sustained decline in unemployment. But, as unemployment continues
to fall, other possibilities need to be investigated. The most optimistic is
that output has been rising faster than estimated. The most pessismistic is
that the growth of output per head has now slowed greatly.
Productivity estimates for the whole economy for the last quarter of 1993
will not be available until today week. But the latest batch of Department
of Employment (DE) statistics did contain up-to-date estimates of
manufacturing productivity increases, which suggest that they had fallen
back from the very high rate of well over 5 per cent early in the recovery
to 2.9 per cent, which is not quite adequate to meet international
competitors.
The return to slightly rising unit costs in manufacturing is due more to the
productivity deceleration than to the very small bounce back in earnings
from autumn lows, attributed by the DE to bonuses and overtime. As the
productivity deceleration mainly affects the estimates from October last
year, it may still be an aberration.
Can the the British unemployment figures be used to suggest that in the UK
at least output is growing above trend and faster than the GDP estimates
suggest? Interpretation is tricky. If the unemployment fall is due mainly to
fewer people registering for benefit, and effectively leaving the labour
force, it is not a sign of recovery. We have, therefore, to look at
estimates for employment; and these come with a lag and at three-monthly
intervals.
The DE regular series shows total employment rising by nearly 0.3 per cent
in 1993, mainly as a result of the growth in self-employment. The Labour
Force Survey (LFS)  - which is preferred by critical commentators  - shows a
similar trend in the year to last autumn.
But before concluding that slack is being taken up, we must reckon with
another much-discusssed complication, the rise of part-time employment,
defined as work for 30 hours or less a week.
The trend to part-time working is long-standing; and it is, of course,
absurd to exclude part-timers from the computation. The question is whether
the rise in the number of part-timers has more or less than offset the fall
in the number of full-timers. In other words, has the total number of hours
worked in the British economy increased or shrunk?
The LFS estimates that, in the year to last autumn, the number of full-time
workers fell by 177,000 and part-time workers rose by 223,000, including the
self-employed. This suggests that the total number of working hours
continues to decline very slightly. But in the last three months of the
period the fall in full-time employment slowed, and the increase in
part-timers accelerated. Confusingly, however, the DE series cast doubt on
whether the improvement was sustained in the final months of the year. As
the decline in average hours worked per employee has levelled off, the
safest conclusion is the total number of hours worked in the economy has
been more or less stable in recent months.
Thus if we are looking at the trend of output in relation to capacity, the
labour market estimates give a neutral impression, and surveys of
manufacturing capacity suggest that the capacity gap has been narrowing
sharply. Averaging the two, we get the impression that output is rising at a
good bit above the sustainable rate.
This is exactly what ought to happen at the present stage of the business
cycle, although the government has got there at least as much by luck as by
judgment. The only argument for a stimulus is that the economy might slow
down as tax rises take effect. The size of these rises has been hyped up in
the City  - which is always sensitive to a lead from the Labour party. A
straw poll in the Goldman Sachs research department showed a belief that
household taxes would rise by Pounds 10-Pounds 12 per week from April,
against an estimate of a good deal less than Pounds 5 by in-house
economists.
The only flicker in the recovery so far is that retail sales volume has
increased by 'only' 2.7 per cent in the year up to the last three months,
against 3.3 per cent in the three months to January. Also, consumer
confidence surveys have shifted downwards, but only to where they were in
autumn. Otherwise, car sales, house prices and construction orders are
moving firmly upwards; and the 1993-94 Budget deficit is likely to be below
expectations thanks to a more buoyant recovery.
It would be unfair to see signs of increasing inflation yet. Producer price
rises have been less than expected. But it is probably true that, in the
language of City analysts, 'the best inflation news is already behind us'.
The fall in wage settlements has grounded, if no worse; and commodity
prices, whether measured in sterling or a currency basket, have started to
rise. In addition, room should surely be left for some rise in exports when
the European economy recovers.
Although many economists are still covering themselves by saying that the
risks to their forecasts are on the downward side, I would now say they are
at least symmetrical. And on interest rates, they are on the upside. Whether
or not the chancellor finds the chance to lop off a 1/4 percentage point in
the present 5 1/4 per cent base rate, by the second half of the year the
trend must surely be upwards; the question can only be by how much and when.

FT  17 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Malaysia: no contracts for Britain if
the consequence is vilification
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From The Prime Minister of Malaysia
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The reports and debates on the Malaysian ban on contracts for British firms
expose a sad degree of ignorance or carelessness on the part of the British
Press and British personalities.
In the first place everyone seems incapable of distinguishing between a loan
and a grant. Persistently, the loan for the Pergau Dam is referred to as a
grant. Had it been a grant, the amount which covered more than half the cost
of the project would certainly have made it a wonderful buy for the
Malaysians, contrary to what the press and some British officials insist it
was.
A loan has to be repaid with interest, however small. The benefit for
Malaysia would only be marginal. On the other hand, if it was not offered,
the project could have gone to non-British companies. Japan offers soft
loans on a yearly basis. Other countries also offer grants or loans when
bidding for projects.
The Pergau loan serves to help pay a British company which presumably would
make a profit. So the aid benefits a British company. Malaysia gets nothing
other than a marginally lower price. How driving a hard bargain in order to
save the Malaysian government's money is considered corruption is beyond us.
Malaysians are not concerned about British scruples over selling arms. Arms
are arms and, whether they are gifts or subsidised or aided or sold at a
massive profit, the purpose is the same. If you have scruples don't sell
arms at all. In no other business is there so much hypocrisy in the west.
When arms are sold, long-term payments or offset programmes or special terms
are invariably offered by everyone.
In any case it is clear that the loan is for the Pergau Dam. It has never
been proven conclusively that it was for the arms purchase. The attempt to
link it with the arms sale is political and intended to embarrass the
British government. Malaysia is not concerned and did not react or comment.
Unhappy with the lack of results over the expose, the British press then
shifted its focus to Malaysia. Of course the natives are corrupt. They must
be, because they are not British and not white. To allege that the Malaysian
prime minister accepted bribes is second nature. He should accept this
allegation because, as a British newspaper later commented, all politicians
in Asia are corrupt. The question is: why do the British insist on
corrupting 'corrupt' people. Don't they have any scruples or do they
consider giving bribes is not corruption?
The allegations against the Malaysian prime minister have turned out to be
baseless. Wimpey denied (them). Even the editor of The Sunday Times said he
was misunderstood.
There was no tender for an aluminium smelter. There was no smelter project.
Only a feasibility study aided by the British government, which hoped to get
the project for a British company, Wimpey. It was not feasible.
Alleging, wrongly, that the Malaysian prime minister is corrupt may be part
of British press freedom. But the Malaysian prime minister need not
subscribe to that, even as Andrew Neil himself did not accept reports on his
affair with Pamella Bordes.
Press freedom is about telling the truth, not fabricating lies for whatever
purpose. The contempt for the hurt inflicted on others seems to be condoned
by the British government and people. No scruples about lying, seemingly
plenty about selling arms? The standard answer to the Malaysians is that the
British press is free. 'Lies, damned lies' are free. Redress isn't. This is
what western democracy and human rights is all about. If this is not moral
decadence, then what is?
Giving contracts to the British seems to expose Malaysia to vilification and
libellous attacks. Why let British companies make money out of Malaysia if
this is to be the consequence? If we are going to be vilified, at least we
should not pay for it. Thus the decision to stop giving contracts to British
firms.
And Britain should be happy. No contracts means no soft loans, no grants and
no corruption of the natives. Since Britain was, according to British
papers, responsible for Malaysia becoming one of the 'economic tigers' of
South East Asia, Malaysia would soon realise the folly of its ways. Then the
free press can gloat when Idi Amin/Hitler/Mahathir comes crawling back with
offers of contracts.
But instead we hear more threats and lies. Seems that paper gunboats still
abound. What can Malaysia do? The free press is free for the British. It is
not free for Malaysians. While British newspapers are freely available in
Malaysia, Malaysian papers are not available to the British. And the British
papers never publish Malaysian views. This is the practical result of
western-style press freedom.
For Malaysia, the die is cast. No contracts in exchange for British press
freedom to tell lies.

FT  17 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Absence of biographies of modern
business leaders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From P V ZEALANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It is not surprising that your March Review of Business Books does not
contain a biography of a success-ful leader of a modern business.
A visit to any large bookshop will similarly fail to unearth among the lives
of politicians, film stars, novelists and sporting idols, any accounts of
how the leaders of today's successful companies reached the top and created
wealth and worth in getting there.
Why is this? Are the plutocrats and dynasts of industry uniquely modest, or
is there no human interest in how their power is manifest?
There is great educational value in disseminating the art of business
leadership, both to managers in work and to a general readership who are the
customers of their enterprise.
Perhaps the Financial Times could bring together the leaders of the
publishing world with those of our most successful retailing, financial and
manufacturing companies.

FRANCOIS MITTERRAND: a study in political leadership
By Alistair Cole
Routledge, 216 pages, Pounds 19.99
LA FIN D'UNE EPOQUE
By Franz-Olivier Giesbert Fayard Seuil, 304 pages, FFr120
I was full of anticipation when I read the press release accompanying
Alistair Cole's book, which says it is the first in-depth political
biography of Francois Mitterrand. Many thick books have already been written
by French authors on this subject, some of them quite distinguished, so it
seemed a bold claim to make.
On the other hand, President Mitterrand is such an important figure in the
postwar history of France, and indeed of Europe, that there must still be
room for the definitive biography. At the moment, as he approaches his final
year of office, he seems a cold and dying star, weakened by the collapse of
his Socialist party, by his own unpopularity, and by the overwhelming power
of the conservative government majority. But history may well judge that his
achievements as a French and European political leader place him second only
to Charles de Gaulle.
De Gaulle restored France's self-respect after the debacle of 1940, and he
rebuilt its political stability after the Algerian war of independence 20
years later. But it was Mitterrand who stifled the French Communist party;
it was Mitterrand who converted the French to the principles of the liberal
economy; and it was Mitterrand who converted the French political
establishment to the cause of European integration. These are not mean
achievements.
Unfortunately, Alistair Cole's book is not the biography we have been
waiting for. In fact, it is not a biography at all, in the ordinary sense of
the term. Cole is a lecturer in politics at the University of Keele, and
this appears to be an academic textbook for students in the department of
politics. It is constructed as a series of themes - 'the party leader', 'the
world leader', 'the European statesman' - which systematically cut across
the sequence of chronology; and the book's essential purpose is set out in
Chapter 11, which purports to evaluate Mitterrand's political leadership
against a matrix of 'resources', 'constraints' and 'opportunities'.
Cole's bibliography shows that he has read a great deal of the published
material, and I do not reproach him for producing a book which is
essentially constipated in tone, second-hand in its facts and tentative in
its judgments. Francois Mitterrand is still very much alive, and the French
political establishment is unusually loquacious in private conversations
with the media; an English academic cannot expect to match the vividness or
the sureness of touch of the French press.
What I do reproach him for, however, is giving an account that all too often
does not quite correspond with the reality I recognise. The facts are there,
but the story that emerges seems time and time again to be just that bit off
beam. To be blunt, despite his considerable book-learning, I am not sure
that Cole fully understands much of the story he is telling.
Take the big turning point in 1983, when Mitterrand abandoned economic
reflation and went for austerity. Cole's economic explanation for this
switch is obviously out of kilter: he implies that the crucial factor was
the cost of the nationalisation programme, whereas in reality it was the
massive injection of purchasing power through a sudden increase in wages and
in public employment. But the deep lacuna in his explanation is that he does
not make the link between the need to keep the franc in the European
Monetary System, and the need to keep France close to Germany at a crucial
moment in the Euro-missile crisis. That is one of the consequences of
chopping up 'leadership' into separate little system boxes.
Similarly, Cole seems to think that the disintegration of the Socialist
party after 1988 was due to Mitterrand's failure to 'exercise leadership
over his former lieutenants'. This is naive rubbish. The simple truth is
that the Socialist party factions, which he had originally created to divide
and rule the party, automatically turned into feudal baronies fighting for
the succession, once Mitterrand had been re-elected and was therefore a lame
duck.
To say that Pierre Mauroy gave up the leadership of the party by 'consent'
is simply misleading; he was forced out by the turncoat alliance between
Laurent Fabius and Michel Rocard. And when he talks about the Socialists'
seismic defeat in 1993, Cole underplays in an extraordinary way the
significance of the corruption factor, both wholesale in the party and
scandalously at the centre of power.
In addition, Cole's prose appears to have been translated from a remote
foreign language by someone with a shaky grasp of English. He uses
'bestowed' when he means 'endowed', 'deduct' when he means 'deduce',
'whole-scale' when he means 'wholesale', Robert Schumann when he means
Robert Schuman, 'primary' when he means 'primitive', 'pursuing' when he
means 'promoting', and 'reverential' when he means 'revered'; and he does
not seem to know the meaning of 'aphorism' or 'endemic'.
After Cole's painful efforts, La Fin d'une Epoque by Franz-Olivier Giesbert,
editor of the Figaro, comes as a delightful relief. This is his fourth book
on contemporary French politics, and it is constructed as a series of
personalised vignettes covering the first months of the new cohabitation
between Mitterrand and the conservatives.
Sceptics may query the literal accuracy of the many conversations in quote
marks; but whatever one's misgivings about creative licence, it is hard to
deny that he gives insights into the personal power play of French politics
that Cole could study with advantage.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr TREVOR HARVEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The paradox of the debate - or lack of - about building society
governance is that among large societies individual members provide some 70
per cent of the loanable funds.
At the same time, at least 99 per cent of their directors have been
initially appointed, not by members, but in typical plc style by existing
boards.
Boards of societies have been happy to tolerate a gap between constitutional
governance theory and practice so long as its results were convenient.
The financial services industry has over-capacity. A mutual, member-based
constitution diffuses power and the pressure of accountability. It also
prevents an effective market for building societies developing.
Low participation rates among building society members is nothing new. It is
even lower among mutual life insurance companies. The real question is
whether this is an issue for radical change or mere tinkering? Will the
Building Societies Commission please take note?

THE HOUSE OF THE SPIRITS (15) Bille August
THE MUSIC OF CHANCE (15) Philip Haas
AUTUMN MOON Clara Law
THE THIRD MAN (PG) Carol Reed
What exactly is going on in the title mansion of Bille August's The House Of
The Spirits? Isabel Allende's original novel was a bestselling chunk of
magic realism by the niece of the junta-toppled Chilean leader Salvador
Allende. Writing in a prose style breathy with mysticism, Miss Allende is to
writers like Gabriel Garcia Marquez what Daphne du Maurier is to Emily
Bronte. Rapt, romantic, rainbow-emotioned: but somehow, in the final
accounting, more Reader's Digest than real literary thing.
In the infinite process of cultural bio-degradation, we now have the film,
which is to the novel what Sylvie Krin is to Daphne du Maurier. In a
'nameless' South American country the years pass while passions explode and
expire. Centre-screen is handsome, hardhearted Jeremy Irons, a landowner and
aspiring politician who owns the 'most productive hacienda in the country'
and the most baffling accent since Loyd Grossman. (Is it American? Irish?
And why does he sound as if he is speaking through a set of dislodged false
teeth?)
Around him swirl Glenn Close, incestuous sister, Meryl Streep, telekinetic
wife, and daughter Winona Ryder who, to Irons's climactic shotgun-toting
fury, loves revolutionary Antonio Banderas. You can tell that this young man
is a dangerous misfit. He appears to be the only person in South America
speaking with a Spanish accent.
As the hours and decades go by, the relationships grow ever more
complicated. The seething backdrop of political change exacerbates things.
Close dies, Streep dies, Irons ages; the audience ages, the script ages, the
film reaches for a quietus or at least for a climax. But when the big coup
finally comes and the rent-a-rebels charge across the land, our now 70-ish
hero has entered his four-hours-in-the-make-up-room phase and
writer-director August (late of Pelle The Conqueror and The Best Intentions)
is searching frantically for a Point To All This.
Of course there is none. The book's notional theme was something about the
reconcilability of present-day enemies under spiritual guidance from the
past. (Everyone comes back as a ghost, causing major congestion in
production designer Anna Asp's lovingly detailed mansions). But the movie
seems more about the revivability of three once starry acting careers,
hoping to jump-start themselves with a prestige property. La Streep gets
another bite at a modern literary 'classic' after the ill-fated Ironweed. La
Close gets to play with La Streep, a longtime ambition according to the
blurb. And Senyor Irons gets to try another way-out character part like the
one that got him an Oscar in Reversal Of Fortune. But this is the worst
performance of his life: caricatured in accent and appearance, undercooked
in conception.
In Philip Haas's The Music Of Chance the Significant Modern Novel strikes
again. Another talented cast stands and delivers the dialogue, all but
reading out the page numbers as they turn.
Paul Auster's fiction is a question of taste: very dry, very teasing, like a
piece of cheese in a mousetrap. This is the one about two itinerant gamblers
(James Spader, Mandy Patinkin) who lose their all, and more, to two fey
poker-playing millionaires (Charles Durning, Joel Grey). To repay Dollars
10,000 they must rebuild the castle wall their creditors have had shipped
into their back garden in loose stones.
Shades of Auschwitz? Vision of America as theme park cum penal colony?
Ex-documentarist Haas has no particular idea and thereby hangs the problem.
A movie that needs the forward thrust of a convinced and convincing metaphor
is instead neutral, craftsmanlike, uncommitted: a sort of radio play with
pictures. Good performances lovingly recorded - especially from Spader,
greasing himself into black locks, black moustache and black-comedy New York
accent  - are no substitute for a kinetic vision. The lumpy, wordy scenes
sit on Auster's story and squeeze all the life out of it.
Clara Law's Autumn Moon, a slow mood-piece from Hong Kong, streaks ahead of
the competition this week. At last] A film-maker who understands that cinema
is more than exposing strips of celluloid before grandstanding actors.
Miss Law's main actors, Masatoshi Nagase and Li Piu Wai, hardly act at all.
He, a young Japanese drifter in Hong Kong, is all touching, kooky
quizzicality, with a haircut that looks as if it had been plugged into the
same mains-socket as his ubiquitous camcorder. She, the schoolgirl who
platonically befriends him, is all zonked teenage anomy mixed with bits of
sly awakening.
The third main character is the city itself, filmed like a giant computer
circuit-board. Maze-like streets and waterways connect with sudden chunks of
skyscraper; the bluish photography lends a dreamlike miasma; and
occasionally God's tweezers descend, as it were, to shove in a new karmic
microchip or to shuffle around the microscopic human components and their
destinies.
This could have been a maudlin 'meeting cute' story between two strangers
each with his/her own language  - they converse in pidgin English  - and
his/her own life-and-love agenda. He is seen strenuously coupling with a
Japanese girlfriend; she timidly beds a self-obsessed schoolmate. But
writer-director Law gives the film the larger lung power of poetic imagery.
A scene of scatterbrained chat under a bridge is filmed in a mesmering
lightshow of reflected ripples, mimicking the rubato of the conversation.
The girl's granny keeps a fridge full of sinisterly splendid jarred
vegetables, resembling the petrified forest of her own mind. And near the
end a do-it-yourself firework display sizzles and flares like the
character's own thoughts. If not quite a masterpiece, this is the work of a
director who could clearly go on to make one.
Autumn Moon is at the ICA. From there why not run to Hampstead to see The
Third Man in a new print? You would arrive in the right breathless state to
catch this still breathless classic. Did a British director really make this
roaring rococo plaything, featuring the best lost-in-a-foreign-city
atmospherics in movie history and a show-off performance (O. Welles) that
never out-showoffs the direction? Carol Reed's film shows in a season of
homegrown cinema at the Everyman, also including The Fallen Idol, Brief
Encounter, Odd Man Out and (new print) Brighton Rock.

FT  17 MAR 94 / Arts: Scary 'Three old ladies' - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rodney Ackland was a friend and admirer of the young Alfred Hitchcock when
there were still silent movies. That is the key to the sensational revival
of Ackland's play, The Old Ladies, at Greenwich. Even Hitchcock would have
been impressed by Annie Castledine's production. It is the first time that I
have felt goose-pimples in the theatre.
Ackland described in his memoirs, The Celluloid Mistress, how he borrowed
the story from the novel by Hugh Walpole. He was so excited at the prospect
of producing of a great milestone in the art of the cinema that at first he
failed to tell Walpole what he was doing.
The Old Ladies, he wrote, 'seemed intensely cinematic: it offered tremendous
scope for warning shadows, huge close-ups of hands and feet and faces, and
the use of ever such significant angles and symbolic objects.' Thus Ackland
wrote the script with only one word of dialogue. It came when Miss
Berringer, an elderly spinster, was so terrified by her gypsy-like
neighbour, Agatha, that she cried 'Jesus]' and then fell dead.
Walpole, when informed, suggested that it might be more lucrative to try a
play before a movie. Ackland complied with this stage version. John Gielgud
agreed to direct and Edith Evans to star. The piece had a decent but not
spectacular run in the West End in 1935. The movie never materialised.
That was the cinema's loss. Hitchcock could have picked up The Old Ladies
just as Hollywood pursued Patrick Hamilton's Rope and Gaslight, which are
similar psychological thrillers from the same period. Ackland, like
Hamilton, is now making a comeback in the theatre.
The tension in the Greenwich production is almost unbearable. It comes at
least as much from the set, the lighting and the accompanying sound effects
as from the acting and the plot. For the plot is pretty well non-existent.
Here are three elderly ladies together in an old house in Polchester, which
might be Colchester or any place around the southern English coast. Two of
them dislike each other. Yet it is a tribute to the play that you never
quite lose the suspicion that it may be Lucy, the amiable one in the middle,
who is the most unhinged.
Nor do the ladies, by today's standards, seem especially old. They are just
three different people, trapped in the same surroundings. Iona McLeish's
two-tier set features a central staircase: the bedrooms of the two disputing
women are at the top. Agatha, the gypsy lady played by Miriam Karlin, is
slightly lame. Anything that happens on or around that staircase is
electric. Even when the lights are out, Agatha is always stirring. The
shadows that Ackland envisaged for a movie version are all over the house.
The technique is teasing. No-one falls down the stairs. The references to
drinking the last drop of coffee or tea are a decoy, for no-one is poisoned
either.
There is no premeditated murder. This might almost be normality in
Polchester, which as in the best of Hitchcock is precisely what makes The
Old Ladies so haunting.
The only failing in Ms Castledine's production is probably not her fault.
The end is not quite as dramatic as the rest of the play has led you to
expect. Yet coming after nearly three hours, which seem to pass like 30
minutes, that it is a small fault. It may even be deliberate: after so much
suspense, why not conclude on a note of anti-climax?
Doreen Mantle plays Lucy with great gentleness, including a reading from
Tennyson. Ms Karlin's Agatha is genuinely frightening, and so is Faith Brook
as the terrified spinster  - but for her frailty not her strength.

FT  17 MAR 94 / Arts: A display of non-specific Hispanic angst - Clement
Crisp reviews the Spanish National Dance company, in Britain for the first
time
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hispanic or not  - and I rather think 'not'  - the programme which marks the
first appearance of the Spanish National Dance Company in this country is of
curious and awful predictability. The company's director and, seemingly,
only choreographer, is Nacho Duato, for several years a dancer and creator
with Nederlands Dans Theater. There he showed himself a dutiful apostle of
Jiri Kylian, who is Czech, and whose many NDT choreographies have propounded
a torso-wrenching energy allied to a bleeding heart (no human suffering, no
oppression or social social disaster, but can find its memorial in Kylian's
oeuvre) as a dance-style that makes every creation a flag-day for a Good
Cause. And Kylian and his followers (they include our own Christopher Bruce)
shop for good causes in the Jumbo All-family packet. War, pestilence and
famine are their themes; anguish their stock in trade; girls in deadly long
dresses, men in no-colour work-clothes  - relieved by the occasional puttee
 - their pawns.
Their dance works begin all too often with the cast staring up-stage at some
amorphous dun-coloured set  - 'the old country' or a heath blasted by
radiation, or, I'll bet, a threatened rain forest. It is, you may be sure,
ecologically sound, politically correct, Green as Green (except the favoured
colour is a muddy beige), and guaranteed bio-degradable.
There follow sequences of movement in which the women either behave like
peasants who have lost their all, or are thrown, torn, forced into squatting
poses, manhandled like sides of beef, by their partners. There is usually a
trio in which some poor creature is tugged into sexually crass positions  -
do these choreographers fear women?  - and spun on her poor knees on the
ground, or made to slide face-down over the stage. The men also have a hell
of a time, and tend to huge, pointless leaps and tense, meaningless
gestures.
Thus the common-places of the Kylian school, much adored in parts of Europe.
It is, I suspect, a dreadful harking back, and a physically brutal
up-dating, of the more tedious forms of central European dance of the 1930s,
when despair was all. And, as this introduction should warn you, it is
exactly what the Spanish National Dance Company proposed in its first
programme of four Duato pieces. Na Floresta, said the programme, was in
praise of the Amazon jungle, that well-known Spanish beauty-spot. At
curtain-rise the cast were gazing at a dingy back-drop, then flung
themselves into anguished action in the sort of outfits we have, alas, come
to expect (Spain, I recalled, was the home of Balenciaga), while charming
Villa Lobos music was played and delightfully sung.
Cor Perdut was a duet for Catherine Allard (in one of those long skirts that
do more for the dance than the dancer) and Mr Duato, in which they may have
been lovers, or merely seeking to borrow some coffee-powder from each other.
Cautiva was interminable, inexplicable, decked with voices intoning what
they thought was poetry, while 16 dancers went on the rampage. It was set to
a score by Alberto Iglesias which suited it exactly. Who was the girl in the
red and unforgiveable ball-dress, in need of both a coiffure and an analyst?
No reason was discernible for anything that happened, and what happened was
bombastic effort, flatulent attitudinising, and the Olympic trials for
rodomontade. Duato's choreography drains his dancers' energies with an
undifferentiated blare of dynamics. It is vampiric tosh.
The closing Rassemblement is about Haitian slave-songs, which sound
touching, and are used for yet another display of mopery  - not especially
relevant, one would have thought, but the Kylian School believe that any
cause (however lost or remote) is better than none, better than
choreographic invention or structural rigour.
Another glum setting; more predictable clothes, and yet more predictable
dances. The company work frightfully hard throughout the evening: Duato
makes them look as if they are suffering from Non-specific Angst. There is
no cure.
Spanish National Dance Company is at Sadler's Wells until March 19.

The charm of the original programmes about Fred Dibnah in the 1970s was that
we seemed to be looking at a survivor from a saner age: here was a man who
earned his living as a steeplejack, drove steam engines in his spare time,
and ran a paternalist family. Now, judging from the first in the new BBC2
series, Life With Fred, there are practically no mill chimneys left, and
Dibnah has been turned into some sort of 'new man' (8.00 BBC2).
If memory serves, The First Ever Minder should prove that the series was
originally intended to provide a niche for Dennis Waterman after he left
'The Sweeney", and that George Cole's character, though older, was
subordinate. 'Gunfight At The OK Launderette' has Waterman, as Terry, caught
up in a siege (8.30 ITV).
Dawn French's Murder Most Horrid has all the plot and action which Jennifer
Saunders' 'Absolutely Fabulous' so notably lacked. Perhaps they should form
a partnership: the French narrative with the Saunders dialogue could be a
winning combination. Today's story has French playing a housekeeper (9.00
BBC2).

FT  17 MAR 94 / Arts: Beckett's 'Footfalls' - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Long after the performance of a Samuel Beckett play ends, its meanings go on
gathering. Plays seldom come shorter than his Footfalls (1976), and yet its
brief mysteries lodge such a wealth of suggestion and connection in your
head that it can effectively fill a whole evening.
The play, which lasts less than 20 minutes, has come to the West End for a
week, two performances per night, all tickets at Pounds 4, with Deborah
Warner directing Fiona Shaw and Susan Engels. The problem, however, is
whether Warner and Shaw help you to attend to the play as much as to their
own way with it.
The two women of Footfalls are mother and daughter. The mother is a voice
(Engels), unseen; the daughter, May (Shaw), a woman now in her forties, whom
we see, continually and audibly paces this way and that, as she goes over
the past in her mind. She has never recovered from some early shock or
shocks; it is possible that she has never recovered from being born. Voice
of mother: 'I had you late. (Pause.) In life. (Pause.) Forgive me again.'
Each woman looms in the other's mind. May (after pacing): 'Were you asleep?'
Voice: 'Deep asleep. (Pause) I heard you in my deep sleep. (Pause) There is
no sleep so deep I would not hear you there.'
Here, as throughout, how many implications a line can have. The numerous
implications of this last line include: Big Mother is hearing you; so deep
is my love for you that your voice will never go unheard by me; the
umbilical cord between us is unbroken and troubles me still; I would sleep
easy were it not for you; you are a voice in my dreams; I will hear you even
when I reach the great sleep of death; you keep breaking into my sleep and
you always will; I can never sleep easy where you are concerned. . .
Since we never see the mother, we may well come to interpret her voice as a
voice within her daughter's mind: in which case that line acquires further
connotations: Mother, I will always wake you; Mother, you will never escape
me; Mother, I will always haunt you; and more.
There is probably not a meaning in the play that Fiona Shaw and Deborah
Warner have not thought about - though they choose to ignore a few of
Beckett's precise instructions. (He required that May's feet be heard but
not seen, and that she have grey hair and wrap. Shaw's feet can be seen;
likewise her dark hair and red dress.) Shaw's obsessive intensity, her wit,
her ability to alternate voices, her Irishness, all pay dividends. So does
Engel's ponderous, cultivated contralto.
Warner's most daring stroke is to have Shaw spend most of the play not
onstage but on a special platform in the centre of the dress circle; and to
have Engel's voice emerge from beneath her, so that Shaw, in the very centre
of the audience, seems to pace upon her mother's tomb.
But must Shaw and Warner reveal their talent in so self-advertising a
manner? Shaw's withered-old-maid posture is too obviously contrived; her
sexually frustrated fiddlings at the folds of dress before her crotch are
over-emphatic; and her little-girl petrified-virgin voice makes the whole
affair artificial.
In some ways, Footfalls seem to encapsulate all those other Shaw-Warner
collaborations that London has seen in recent years (Electra, The Good
Person of Sichuan, Hedda Gabler). I do not mean that as much of a
compliment. Thanks largely to Warner, Shaw has developed in recent years a
dreadfully solipsistic way of acting, as if there were no one else onstage;
thanks also to Warner, she has become our most emphatic exponent of female
neurosis and/or victimisation and/or masochism. True, Footfalls is a far
more appropriate vehicle for all this than those other plays - but one still
feels that this is just more of the same.
At the Garrick Theatre until March 19. Presented by Deborah Warner and
Maison de la Culture, Bobigny, Paris.

FT  17 MAR 94 / Technology: Acquiring a taste for genes - Genetic
engineering is sparking a food revolution / A report on its impact
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DELLA BRADSHAW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last month, international brewers sat down, put their feet up and enjoyed a
beer which had taken nearly 30 years to develop. The 150 bottles of the
premium-quality lager Nutfield Lyte were the first in the world to be brewed
using a genetically-altered yeast.
There was a real 'schoolboy element' among some of the thrilled imbibers on
receiving their bottle of the new beer, reports Bernard Atkinson, director
of BRF International, in Nutfield, Surrey, which carries out pre-competitive
research into brewing. BRF's members account for 25 per cent of the world's
brewing volume.
The eager public, however, will have to wait before being able to taste such
a novel drink. The aim of the exercise, says Atkinson, has been to
demonstrate the possibilities that genetic engineering opens up to the
brewing industry.
If brewers decide to use BRF's genetically-altered yeast, which was approved
for UK use by the Advisory Committee on Novel Foods and Processes last
month, they could have a beer on the market by the end of the year.
More likely, says Atkinson, is that they will use the genetic engineering
techniques to adapt their own favourite yeasts, which could take several
years. 'We have modified our yeast, not the brewers'. The sensible thing
would be for them to modify their own yeasts.'
Nevertheless, believes Atkinson, the breakthrough has demonstrated to both
brewers and the general public what can be achieved using
genetically-altered food processes. He thinks Nutfield Lyte will help fuel
the debate. 'Science doesn't actually leap into the marketplace. It takes
time for people to accept the developments,' he says. 'People's thought
processes are moving on. The reality is that until you have a hard case the
debate doesn't become focused. The beer is here now; people can drink it.'
The debate about genetic engineering's impact on foods is likely to
intensify this year as milk from cows treated with the manufactured hormone
bovine somatotrophin (BST), which greatly stimulates milk production, and
tomatoes, genetically altered to prevent them turning squashy, appear on
American supermarket shelves.
They could be the first of many such foods, says Robin Jenkins, of Genetics
Forum, the London-based group which argues for the responsible use of
genetic engineering technology. 'There isn't a single fruit, vegetable or
animal that isn't the subject of research of some kind.'
His main concern about genetic engineering is that 'the technology has moved
ahead of the science base'. He believes that until the individual genomes
are mapped out, there could be risks in moving genes from one organism to
another.
He also believes that most genetically-altered foods are produced to suit
food manufacturers, not consumers. 'There is no way the technology can be
market led. The marketing department can't go down to the research
department and ask them to produce spinach which tastes like chocolate,
which children would love to eat and which parents would love them to have
because it's good for them.'
Further, he believes that food companies have spent so much on developing
the products - Monsanto and other chemical companies have spent close on
Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) developing the BST hormone - that the technology
will be foisted on an unwilling public, whatever the cost.
Those lobbying against genetically-engineered foods believe they could make
dining a risky process, labelling them 'Frankenfoods'. The
genetically-altered tomatoes, being developed by the Californian
biotechnology company Calgene, and Zeneca, formerly part of Britain's ICI,
use an antibiotic-resistant marker to signal the successful transfer of the
added gene, which blocks the enzyme that makes tomatoes soften and
eventually go squashy. One fear in the long term is that if enough tomatoes
are eaten the consumer could inherit a resistance to that antibiotic.
Calgene responds by saying that the marker is de-activated once it enters
the human digestive system, and therefore cannot produce any unwanted
side-effects.
The tomato has yet to receive approval from the US Food and Drug
Administration, but a spokesperson for Calgene said that once the green
light was given it would take only three to six months to get the new tomato
on to US supermarket shelves.
Atkinson makes a straightforward distinction between the tomatoes and his
beer: in the former, the new gene is part of the food; in the latter it is
only part of the food production process, as is the use of BST in increasing
milk yields. The genetically-altered yeast used in the brewing process is
removed and under current regulations has to be destroyed. 'You're not
tasting genetically-altered beer, you're tasting beer produced by
genetically-altered yeast,' he adds.
The brewers altered a gene in order to produce a low-carbohydrate beer, with
fewer calories than traditional brews. Brewer's yeasts, unlike other strains
of yeast, lack the enzyme which converts the starch from the malt into
alcohol. By adding an enzyme-producing gene from another yeast the same
amount of alcohol can be produced from less starch.
Atkinson believes that genes with different properties could enable beer
makers to produce the required brew more easily. One potential application
he cites is in the production of a better-tasting beer. A particular 'off
flavour' produced by yeasts is a butterscotch taste. Today brewers need to
manipulate the fermentation process in order to eliminate the taste.
Eventually this could be done by altering the yeast.
It could also prove a simpler process to develop new ranges of beer. 'Now,
if you want a new flavour in your beer you have to find a new yeast. Now,
we're talking about taking a yeast you know about and tuning it. It's a very
elegant solution.'
While tomato and beer makers are pondering the potential of such gene
manipulation, some genetically-altered processes are already in widespread
use, in the production of cheese, for example.
Traditionally, the enzyme needed to clot milk and turn it into cheese, is
extracted as rennet from a calf's stomach. Researchers have now cloned the
gene for the clotting enzyme and transferred it to bacteria, which produce
large quantities of rennet in fermenters.
Only the enzyme itself is used in the cheese-making process. And, says Mike
Gasson, head of the genetics and microbiology department at the Institute of
Food Research in Norwich, the enzyme is 'nature identical' to the one
extracted from the stomachs of dead calves.
Gasson describes the laboratory production of the enzyme as 'squeaky clean'.
Jenkins, too, is supportive of this type of genetic engineering, and
believes many of the big food companies are doing innovative work in the
areas of food production.
However, the sale of these cheeses has highlighted the problem of whether
genetically-altered foods, or those produced using gene alteration
techniques, should be labelled. The issue has produced strong reactions in
the US, where milk produced using BST does not have to be labelled to that
effect. In Europe, too, it looks unlikely that such foods will be labelled.
In the UK, the Co-op food chain labels cheeses if they are produced using
the laboratory-created enzyme. But recent recommendations from the
Polkinghorne ethical committee say foods need only be labelled when they
contain a human gene, or if a non-vegetarian gene is inserted into a food
which vegetarians might eat - a fish gene into a tomato, say - or if the new
gene might offend on religious grounds.
As a result, says Jenkins, a beef product which contained a gene from a pig
would be labelled as such; a beef product which contained a gene from a
horse would not be labelled, although many people would find the latter more
distasteful. 'All they did,' he complains, 'was pander to those who
responded loudest.'

FT  17 MAR 94 / People: Strutt returns to Hong Kong
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Henry Strutt, 40, head of Robert Fleming's Far East broking operations, has
been appointed managing director of Jardine Fleming, the jointly-owned Hong
Kong merchant bank which regularly provides around a third of Flemings'
total profits.
Strutt is no stranger to Hong Kong. He worked for Jardine Fleming from 1980
to 1992 and was in charge of Jardine Fleming's Tokyo business before
returning to London. He takes over in July from Alan Smith, 50, who has been
managing director for more than a decade.
Jardine Fleming, set up in 1970 with a capital of Pounds 250,000, is jointly
owned by Jardine Matheson and Robert Fleming. It is Hong Kong's oldest
merchant bank, operates in 15 countries in the Pacific basin, and employs
2,200 people, or nearly as many as Robert Fleming's total UK staff. In 1992
it reported after-tax profits of Dollars 76m and in the first six months of
1993 earned Dollars 77m.
Robert Fleming's Peter Jamieson, the first managing director of Jardine
Fleming, was an old university chum of Henry Keswick, the chairman of
Jardine Matheson, who also sits on the Robert Fleming board. Since then
Jardine Matheson has tended to supply the joint venture's non-executive
chairman and Robert Fleming has often provided the managing director. John
Manser, Fleming's current chief executive, headed Jardine Fleming in the
late 1970s.
However, Alan Smith, 50, a British solicitor who joined Jardine Fleming in
1972, has spent the bulk of his career with the Hong Kong merchant bank and
his promotion to executive chairman suggests that the joint venture is
starting to have a life of its own. Traditionally, the Taipan of Jardine
Matheson's Hong Kong operations has been chairman of Jardine Fleming. Smith
takes over as chairman next month from Nigel Rich, the current Taipan, who
is moving to London to be chief executive of Trafalgar House.

FT  17 MAR 94 / People: Yates' logical move to put theory into practice
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Martin Read, nearing the completion of his first year as managing director
of Logica, the UK computing services company, is continuing his
reconstruction work on the company's management team.
Latest recruit is 45-year-old Jim Yates who, but for tardy paperwork
connected with a Citroen DS23 he was buying, would be back in his native
Australia, rather than taking responsibility for Logica's troubled North
American and Asia Pacific operations.
Educated at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, he was an officer
in the Australian Army signals corps when in 1974 he decided to tour Europe,
ostensibly for a couple of years. Held up by the paperwork needed to export
the car from the UK and at a loose end, he accepted a job as computer
programmer at Ferranti International and stayed for 16 years.
When the company was brought down by fraud at ISC, its US subsidiary, he was
given charge of clearing up some of the mess, which convinced him that
British companies could make a better job of managing their overseas
subsidiaries than often appeared to be the case.
More recently he has been managing director of GEC/ Alsthom's transport
signalling business and md of GEC Information Systems.
As director of international operations at Logica he has the opportunity to
put his theories into practice. The US has been a black hole for Logica for
some years. Much of the restructuring work has been done but profitability
remains elusive.
Yates got rid of the Citroen when Ferranti supplied him with a company car.
He regrets that; the car has become a collector's item and is worth more now
than he sold it for.

FT  17 MAR 94 / Technology: Globalisation prompts exodus - The rise in US
companies' overseas R&amp;D spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH SHAPLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Are US companies losing their taste for research and development activities
in their own country? If so, how much does this matter?
The answer to the first question seems to be yes, based on the latest
figures for US industry's R&amp;D spending from the National Science
Foundation's (NSF) survey of 23,000 companies in its report, Science
Indicators 1993. Funds committed to R&amp;D abroad have soared - they rose
nine-fold between 1985 and 1991 - while the amount spent in the US has
stagnated.
The second question is tougher, since world business trends make it
inevitable that companies will spend more on foreign R&amp;D. Thus says Proctor
Reid of the Academy of Engineering: 'It is not clear that the larger number
of dollars being spent overseas would have been spent on R&amp;D at home, had
they not gone abroad.'
As with the take-off in US overseas capital investment in 1970s, Reid says
the build-up of foreign R&amp;D to support US companies globally is a natural
development which will strengthen them at home in the long run.
Globalisation is one of the three main forces behind the exodus of US
industrial R&amp;D abroad. But it affects other countries, too. According to
Manuel Serapio, a business professor at the University of Colorado: 'Not
only are US companies moving R&amp;D abroad, the Japanese are increasing their
R&amp;D investment in the US and Europe, while Europe is increasing its R&amp;D
investment in the US and Japan.'
As US industry moved more manufacturing operations abroad in the 1980s,
design and engineering followed. Serapio notes that companies have two kinds
of motives. One is to tailor products they already make in a local market;
the other is to test an untried region.
The second force is the worldwide spread of knowledge. In the post-war
decades, the US dominated the knowledge base for most advanced products.
Now, not only Europe, but Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Latin America
generate innovation, too. Third, foreign science and engineering workers can
be much cheaper; software that would cost Dollars 1m (Pounds 600,000) in the
US might cost just Dollars 50,000 in India.
Under these powerful influences, US industry spending on R&amp;D abroad rose
after the mid-1980s; it went from a level equivalent to 6.4 per cent of the
sum spent in the US in 1985 to 11.3 per cent in 1991. The total of Dollars
8.7bn spent abroad in 1991, the last year for which the NSF has data, was a
record.
While overseas R&amp;D spending has accelerated, US companies' R&amp;D spending at
home has stayed at Dollars 65bn in real terms. Moreover, industrial research
managers predict flat or declining R&amp;D spending in the US, according to the
Industrial Research Institute.
As much as three-quarters of the non-US R&amp;D effort is in Europe. In Germany,
the focus is mainly on R&amp;D in the motor industry. That in Britain and France
is mainly in chemicals and drugs. Only 6 per cent of US overseas R&amp;D
investment goes to Japan.
The areas in which US companies tend to concentrate their foreign R&amp;D
efforts are:
Cars. US motor concerns spend the most on R&amp;D in the US, but do not release
figures showing changes in domestic R&amp;D. In 1988, they spent nearly Dollars
1.5bn on R&amp;D overseas, a sixth of that year's R&amp;D total. Today, US car
makers spend at least Dollars 2bn a year in Europe.
Chemicals. Drugs and medical groups increased their overseas R&amp;D three times
over in 1985-91, while their US R&amp;D did not even double.
Software. The survey revealed a 672 per cent leap in 'non-manufacturing'
companies' overseas R&amp;D spending in the same period. Though this was only
Dollars 121m of the total spending on R&amp;D overseas in 1991, it included the
significant area of software.
This is one area in which modern communications easily allows companies to
obtain access to skills abroad.

Blue Circle Properties, a subsidiary of Blue Circle, has appointed John
McCready to be managing director of its proposed Pounds 300m Bluewater Park
retail and leisure scheme at Dartford.
Since November 1992, McCready has been working as a consultant on the
funding of the 1.625m sq ft project. The realisation of the project depends
on finding a development partner to fund it, though he says he is hopeful
that the scheme will go ahead later this year.
McCready, 37, began his career as an accountant. After taking an MBA at
Insead in France, he joined Goldman Sachs in London, where he specialised in
property and leisure. He then worked as a corporate financier for 2 1/2
years for the Arab Banking Corporation, which he left in the aftermath of
the Gulf War.
He replaces Peter Nuttall who resigned recently to join Embassy Property

FT  17 MAR 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): The cost of a fair
deal - Products appealing to consumer conscience
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two years ago, Justino Peck, a cocoa farmer from a small village near the
Maya mountains in Belize, abandoned his crop following a collapse in
international prices. Now he is back in production with a three-year
contract to supply cocoa beans to Green &amp; Black's chocolate company in
Britain.
Maya Gold chocolate made from Peck's beans went on sale in 80 supermarkets
in the UK last week as the first product to carry a seal of approval from
Fairtrade, an organisation which is trying to ensure workers in the Third
World get a better deal.
In July, the Royal Society for the Protection of Animals (RSPCA) plans to
issue its own label - Freedom Food - for meat and eggs which have been
produced, transported and slaughtered in a humane way.
Both organisations hope to capitalise on the conscience of the 1990s
consumer who fills his supermarket trolley with environmentally friendly
washing powder and recycled toilet paper.
A poll by NOP for Christian Aid conducted in October last year found that 68
per cent of the 1,000 adults surveyed said they would be willing to pay more
for products that guaranteed a fair return to farmers and workers in the
Third World. The average amount consumers were prepared to pay was 25p on an
item that normally costs Pounds 1.
The RSPCA's own research has indicated that 30 per cent of those polled
would pay up to 50 per cent more for meat from an animal that had been well
treated.
Maya Gold chocolate costs Pounds 1.55 for 100g compared with 65p for the
same amount of Cadbury's Bourneville chocolate, but the company says it
contains three times as much cocoa. Green &amp; Black's is paying the Belize
farmers 48p per lb for their cocoa beans which is higher than the current
free market price of 41.5p per lb.
Similarly, Cafedirect, a high-quality ground coffee containing beans from
Costa Rica, Mexico, Nicaragua and Peru, pays its suppliers up to double the
market rate paid by other companies. Cafedirect, which has been on the
supermarket shelves for two years, will carry the Fairtrade mark from April.
Fairtrade is looking at other products such as tea and honey, but these are
not likely to capture more than a very small share of the mass market.
Although many consumers say in market research they want to pay more for a
'conscience' product, it is hard to get them to part with their money.
The Co-operative Wholesale Society has been looking for several years to
launch its own brand of 'conscience' products such as coffee, tea and honey.
But 'when it comes to the crunch, particularly in a recession, people are
looking for bargains', says Martin Henderson from the Co-op.
The Co-op was the first supermarket chain to carry Cafedirect, but has found
that sales have been disappointing. 'We're looking for a bigger volume
market to move into, but we haven't cracked it yet,' says Henderson.
The most important problem faced by retailers and companies looking to
appeal to peoples' consciences is in how to turn aspirations into hard cash.
Mike Sharp, marketing manager for the RSPCA, says the problem lies in public
confusion over claims made by certain products. Consumers are also cynical
about being offered another marketing ploy.
The RSPCA is hoping that its Freedom Food mark will not only occupy a niche
but also cover as wide a part of the market as possible.
'The consumer response has been very positive because the RSPCA is trusted
as an independent party,' said Sharp. The label will be issued on pork and
eggs in July and move to all other products derived from animals in the
longer term.
Richard Adams, who runs the New Consumer Organisation, a research group,
thinks the way to encourage the public to buy 'conscience' products could be
to group them in a separate High Street store. He is currently conducting a
feasibility study.

Euro-barriers - Diane Summers looks at a Brussels questionnaire on

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Any day now, thousands of businesses across Europe will be receiving a fat
envelope containing a questionnaire from the European Commission on
'commercial communications'.
The combination of the words 'Commission' and 'questionnaire' on the missive
would probably be enough on their own to make some people reach for the
waste paper basket. Compounding matters is the unfamiliar notion of
'commercial communications'. In rough translation, this means advertising,
but also includes sales promotion and direct marketing material, as well as
aspects of packaging and labelling.
The Commission is trying to find out what barriers would prevent a company
conducting, for example, a pan-European press advertising campaign or
marketing its products in another member state. In the UK, the Advertising
Association would see the French Loi Evin, which placed severe restrictions
on alcohol advertising from January 1993, as the latest example of such a
barrier.
The survey is also intended to help Brussels to get a grip on its policy
making and establish a single point of contact on marketing issues.
Currently, proposals affecting advertising and marketing spring from every
directorate and there is a widespread view that these areas have largely
been forgotten in the discussion about completion of the internal market.
The association has compiled a list of such draft legislation currently on
the books. It includes: a proposal for a total ban on tobacco advertising
throughout the EU (stalled at the final stages); draft rules on 'distance
selling' through direct response advertisements and mail order (in a council
working group and awaiting a second reading by the European Parliament);
proposals on comparative advertising (awaiting Commission redraft); and
rules on claims in food advertising (awaiting a Commission proposal).
To file the Euro-questionnaire in the bin too hastily would be a mistake,
according to Lionel Stanbrook, the association's expert on Europe. In his
view, the Commission is providing a 'make or break chance' for businesses to
press for freedom to advertise their goods and services across member
states.
The questionnaire is the start of a year-long consultation by the Commission
on advertising and the European internal market, intended to lead to the
publication of a green paper later this year and the formulation of a policy
during 1995.
This policy, says Stanbrook, 'could mean heavy restrictive legislation; it
could mean a green light for effective self-regulation; it might mean a
confirmation of the status quo'. If the Commission receives powerful
evidence from respondents of the questionnaire that the single market in
commercial communications is not working, Stanbrook even believes it could
'propose a European deregulation initiative of spectacular consequences'.
He believes the questionnaire forms part of a 'genuine consultation with a
genuinely uncertain outcome' and that the Commission officials concerned
'have a good knowledge of the economic importance of marketing
communications in a free market'.
At the same time, however, he acknowledges that the Commission is not
starting from a clean sheet and Maastricht Treaty amendments bring two
further elements to the discussion: subsidiarity, and an obligation to
establish as a priority a high level of consumer protection throughout the
EU.
It is here, he fears, that the genuinely free market in communications could
come unstuck. Stanbrook says: 'The Commission itself is starting to include
'minimal clauses' in draft legislation on consumer protection, allowing
member states to set higher standards and rules than those set out in the
draft legislation. This trend is unlikely to establish a single market
without internal barriers. In this sense, subsidiarity could prove to be the
fatal catch-all excuse for the maintenance of national trade protection'.

FT  17 MAR 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Art, but not just
for art's sake - Cartier is using sponsorship to raise awareness among the
young
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Some company chairmen might be tempted to see their corporate art collection
as a chance to indulge themselves by dabbling in the art market: but Alain
Dominique Perrin, head of Cartier, the jewellers, prefers a business-like
approach.
'It's pure marketing,' he claims. 'I'm passionate about art, but that has
absolutely nothing to do with our corporate activities. Cartier began buying
contemporary art 10 years ago - strictly for commercial reasons. It's been
part of our marketing strategy ever since.'
This month marked the start of a new phase in Cartier's art strategy with
the opening of a stunning FFr120m (Pounds 14m) glass palace in the
Montparnasse area of Paris designed by Jean Nouvel, the futuristic French
architect. The new building will house the headquarters of Cartier France
and the Fondation Cartier art collection.
Art sponsorship is an established part of corporate life in France. A good
corporate citizen is expected to support the arts: not simply by sponsoring
occasional exhibitions but by forging a long-term relationship with a
particular medium. The GAN insurance group has nurtured close links with the
cinema: as has Credit Commercial de France, the bank, with photography.
Cartier had a dual aim when it ventured into the cultural arena. Perrin
decided in the early 1980s to 'give a face-lift to a 150-year-old luxury
house' by raising awareness of Cartier among younger consumers and opinion
formers.
The company in 1983 conducted a research study that identified contemporary
art as an appealing area to both target groups. It created the Fondation
Cartier in the following year and gave it an annual budget (worth FFr26m in
1993) to build up a collection. The foundation has since staged exhibitions
in a villa and park at Jouy-en-Josas near Paris and has sponsored shows in
other countries.
Cartier regularly researched the impact of the foundation's work. Perrin
says that it has been 'clearly proven' to have 'a very positive impact on
the brand' among the target groups. The foundation has also become part of
Cartier's staff relations programme by organising regular visits and
contemporary art classes for employees.
After 10 years the foundation has completed its original objective of
building up a contemporary collection. Cartier has decided to mark the move
to central Paris with a change of direction. The core of the existing
collection will be displayed at Montparnasse, but the bigger pieces of
sculpture will be donated to museums in eastern Europe.
The emphasis of the foundation's work will also switch from acquisition to
organising temporary exhibitions and artists' residencies at Montparnasse.
'The foundation has achieved a lot over the past 10 years,' says Perrin.
'Now it's time to move on.'

FT  17 MAR 94 / Accountancy Column: Celebrations for the Father of
bookkeeping: The anniversary of a text by a 15th-century monk has sparked
debate over the origins of double-entry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
You might have thought that with half a millennium during which to work,
accounting historians would by now have got their facts straight about the
development of double-entry bookkeeping. If so, you would be wrong.
Five hundred years after the publication of what is generally acknowledged
to be the first textbook of modern accountancy, the academics researching
the topic still seem to be as divided in their interpretations as they are
in their (surprisingly large) number.
Most would at least agree to a common definition of double-entry
bookkeeping: for every debit there is a corresponding, balancing credit. It
is a sacred principle still worshipped today, the basis of ledger-keeping  -
manual and electronic  - used daily by millions of number crunchers around
the world.
That is about as far as the consensus goes. Few could debate that a weighty
book was published in Venice in 1494 called Summa de Arithmetica, Geometria,
Proportioni et Proportionalita, and attributed to Friar Luca Pacioli, a
Franciscan monk turned teacher, which describes the so-called 'Venetian
method' of accounting.
But was he the author? Was his work original? Was he truly the first to
codify double-entry bookkeeping? More important, does it all matter anyway?
In the past few weeks, intense argument has been aired on these and other
related topics.
Pacioli has certainly triggered a great bout of self-reflection. Some
individuals and professional bodies have been so eager to unpop the
champagne corks of celebration that they have not waited for November, which
was the month of publication 500 years ago.
Last month, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales  -
eager to get in first  - dressed up a hapless soul in a habit to publicise
its 'Figures in proportion' exhibition on Pacioli. In characteristically
more didactic fashion, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland
held a two-day 'Festival of Accounting' conference earlier this month.
In April, the Italians gather in Venice to discuss and dine sumptuously in
memoriam of the monk.
It has been left to the enterprising Americans to arrange a four-day
re-creation of Pacioli's 'historic' trek from his birthplace of Sansepolcro
to Urbino. The trek takes place this summer, at the conclusion of a seminar,
'The Pathway of Pacioli', and has been organised by Dave Tinius and Bill
Weis, two Seattle-based academics who have done more than anyone to nurture
festivities over nearly a decade.
Yet these signs of homage are in stark contrast to the dark ages of just a
few years ago. Copies of Pacioli's Summa were changing hands for extremely
modest sums. He was barely recognised or memorialised in his own home town.
The Italians had little time for him, in contrast to some of his
contemporaries such as Leonardo da Vinci, his friend and collaborator.
Pacioli was certainly an unconventional monk. In spite of taking monastic
orders, his friendship with Giuliano della Rovere, who conveniently became
Pope Julius II, led to a papal bull in 1508 waiving Pacioli's obligation to
obey the Franciscan vow to live 'in obedience, without property, and in
chastity'.
He seems to have taken full advantage of all three exemptions, being accused
of self-love by Erasmus, living comfortably and incurring the wrath of his
fellow monks at death by leaving much of his money to his family and not his
monastery.
For Frans Volmar of the University of Limburg in the Netherlands, Pacioli
was 'the perfect accountant'. He sees him as a crusader against the
heathenism of his times, a leading proponent of the Franciscan beliefs that
mathematics and the arts could revive Christianity.
He says that while the Summa was not original in its thoughts, it was a
detailed description of the best accounting practices, which met the
definition of a conceptual framework as used today by the US Financial
Accounting Standards Board.
He argues that among the points Pacioli highlights are the importance of
orderly bookkeeping and internal controls, fairness, consistency, full
disclosure, relevance, prudence, materiality and the role of profit
generation as an objective.
Volmar even sees in the text discussions on more advanced accounting issues
such as the treatment of banking transactions, joint ventures, branches,
bills of exchange, extraordinary items and foreign currency translation.
Some academics stress that Pacioli was a great populariser, writing, for
example, in the Tuscan and Venetian dialects rather than the Latin which was
all but ubiquitous in scholarly circles at the time. It was this that helped
form the basis of innumerable copycat accounting texts elsewhere in Europe
and beyond from the early 16th century onwards.
A more cynical commentator might suggest that Pacioli was also the father of
modern creative accountancy. As his text on inventories advises: 'Giving to
each entry an average price from your own personal knowledge, rather higher
than low; that is, should they appear to you as worth 20, put them down at
24. By this means you will obtain better profit.'
Others are certainly less convinced than Volmar about the Pacioli's legacy.
Among the accusations are that he did not invent double-entry bookkeeping
but merely codified it; that he may not have written the Summa himself; and
that his text is flawed.
As early as 1550, he was being accused of plagiarising from the work Piero
della Francesca, his first teacher. The father of modern Pacioli iconoclasm
is Basil Yamey, emeritus professor at the London School of Economics. He has
suggested a series of inadequate or confusing points in Pacioli's text that
cast doubt on the usefulness of the text as a means of instruction in
double-entry.
These views are shared by Richard Macve from the University of Wales, who
also highlights vital omissions, contradictions and obscurities which he
says make Pacioli's treatise like a computer software manual 'which always
seems to omit the crucial instruction'.
He stresses that Pacioli's experience of commerce is second-hand, and that
he fails to describe state-of-the-art accounting already long in place in
Venice, covering issues such as depreciation and contingency reserves.
Other scholars have traced rudimentary double-entry back at least as far as
the 13th century, while some suggest it may have its origins in regions and
eras as diverse as ancient Greece or Rome, Arabia, India, Iran, Peru and
Spain.
The more fundamental question is whether double-entry bookkeeping matters
anyway. Accountants have a vested interest in suggesting its importance as
the lubricant if not the fuel powering the development of modern capitalism.
They even have an unexpected ally in Goethe, who called it 'one of the most
beautiful inventions of the human spirit'.
But while it may have been mathematically elegant, it may not have been
mercantile-relevant. Yamey and Macve  - to the dissent of many of their
colleagues  - suggest that double-entry did not become widely adopted in
Europe or the US until the 19th century.
They suggest that while it may in modern time have helped provide
co-ordination and control in large commercial organisations, it was not in
any way vital for the development of entrepreneurial capitalism.
Nevertheless, whether for good or bad, accountants would probably have been
far less populous in the world without Pacioli. That is his legacy, and the
charge on which he should perhaps be tried.

FT  17 MAR 94 / Labour MPs in pivotal position
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Many council leaders who oppose the government's review of local-authority
responsibilities have started lobbying Labour MPs, who have been placed in a
pivotal position by dissension among Tories.
In the past week the Labour leaders of 38 English and Welsh county councils
have called on the party to abandon its support for the review, claiming it
will be a 'political disaster'. But the leaders of more than 100 Labour-run
district councils have urged the party's MPs not to drop their strong
support for unitary councils, which combine the present functions of
districts and councils.

FT  17 MAR 94 / Main candidates chosen for Eastleigh
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour yesterday named its candidate for the Eastleigh by-election,
completing the line-up of hopefuls from the main parties for the seat
formerly held by Mr Stephen Milligan.
The Labour candidate is Ms Marilyn Birks, 42, a further-education lecturer,
who chairs the Eastleigh constituency Labour party.
The Conservative candidate, Mr Stephen Reid, is a data processing manager
and leader of Basingstoke and Deane Borough Council. He is defending a
majority of 17,702. The by-election follows the death of Mr Milligan last
month.
The seat is widely expected to fall to Mr David Chidgey, the Liberal
Democrat, a civil engineer and former local councillor. He came second with
21,296 votes at the 1992 general election.
The party holds nearly half the seats on Eastleigh District Council, and
recently won the last Conservative seat on Hedge End Town Council, in the
heart of the constituency.
The Liberal Democrats overcame similar large Conservative majorities to win
by-elections at Newbury and nearby Christchurch last year.
The Eastleigh by-election is one of five expected to be held in the next two
months. The other four  - one in Rotherham and three in east London  - are
regarded as safe Labour seats.
The government is likely to hold the by-election on May 5, the date of local
elections across Britain.

FT  17 MAR 94 / Ashdown urges more share bonus plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, yesterday called for a big
increase in the use of share incentive schemes to improve industrial
competitiveness.
He said that wider employee share ownership was part of the answer to the
'fundamental question' of how to compete with Pacific-rim economies without
endangering social cohesion. He said that only 55 per cent of British
companies used bonus schemes, and only a sixth of companies with share
incentive schemes had extended them to non-executive staff.
Mr Ashdown told the Involvement and Participation Association, a business
group, that tax incentives should be used to increase employee
shareholdings. He pledged that a Liberal Democrat government would give
employees the right to participate in decision-making if companies failed to
set up voluntary consultation.
He said: 'My message to industry is this. If you don't want compulsory
structures for consulting employees, prove that you are. . . practising
genuine employee involvement.'
A Liberal Democrat working group led by Baroness Williams, the former Labour
cabinet minister, is drawing up detailed plans for employee rights and share
schemes. Its draft proposals are believed to suggest that the numbers of
employee shareholders could be 'massively' increased if the tax treatment of
executive and ordinary share incentive schemes was equalised.
The group is considering legal reforms to prevent companies restricting
schemes to executives. Stock Exchange rules requiring shareholder approval
for broader-based schemes would be abolished.
Mr Ashdown's remarks are in line with his party's long-standing commitment
to increased employee participation and wider share ownership of industry.

FT  17 MAR 94 / Film industry campaigns for levy on distributors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British film makers yesterday launched a campaign to persuade the government
to impose a voluntary levy on film distributors backed by a series of tax
breaks in order to rejuvenate the industry.
Supported by actors such as Michael Caine and producers David Puttnam and
Jeremy Thomas the 'Impact' campaign argues that money from cinema, video and
pay-television distributors should be transferred to British film-making in
return for tax breaks.
Mr Tom Gutteridge, chairman of Pact, the main film and television producers'
organisation, said that modest changes could lead to Pounds 220m a year in
extra finance for the industry and would cost the government nothing after
two years. 'We are not looking for additional government subsidy,' he said.
'Our plans are going to make money for Britain.'
The main suggestion is that all those who distribute films in the UK would
be assessed and then encouraged to spend a small percentage of qualifying
revenues  - probably around 1 per cent  - on British film-making.
In return they would be able to get a 100 per cent write-off on the
investment in the first year. At the moment film investment is written off
over three years.
Impact believes this measure could generate Pounds 60m a year of new
production finance for the industry. A further Pounds 160m could be raised
if the first-year tax deduction available to all British films was increased
to 65 per cent.
The National Heritage Department helped to fund a study by Hydra/Olsberg,
strategy consultants for Pact which provided most of the Impact proposals.
To make the scheme more flexible for the distributors, this study suggested
the creation of Film Depository Receipts which they would receive after
promising to help finance British films.
The FDRs could be combined from different sources to finance a single film
and would be a flexible means of attracting the special tax concessions for
the distributors.
'If the system we propose were introduced then the effect would be to
revitalise the UK production base without denting the profitability of the
investors involved,' Mr Gutteridge said.

FT  17 MAR 94 / Local councils to demand more parishes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government will today be urged to create more parishes as part of its
review of local government.
The National Association of Local Councils, which represents community,
parish and town councils, says that about 13m people in rural England
effectively have a 'three-tier' local government system of counties,
districts and parishes. Parish and equivalent councils are served by 75,000
councillors.
Merging counties and districts would mean that in 'unparished' areas
(without a parish, town or community council) local government would become
more distant, they say. Residents would have only one tier to complain to if
they faced problems.
Parish councils celebrate their centenary this year, and will attempt to use
the anniversary, coupled with the review, to raise the profile of their tier
of government.
Several counties, including Oxfordshire and Surrey, are also exploring ways
of devolving power to local councils, thereby doing away with the
district-level tier.
Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, has urged that local government
reform work on the 'subsidiarity' principle, whereby all powers are devolved
to the lowest practical level. However, the legislation that started the
review does not allow transfers of functions and responsibilities between
the tiers.
Mr Martin Harvey, the NALC's deputy secretary, said that if subsidiarity was
to be implemented properly, counties or districts should make agency
agreements with parishes to deliver specific services  - such as local
libraries  - which are currently a county responsibility.
He also said that subsidiarity would require separate entries for parish
councils in government grants. At present, parishes gain all their funding
from the grant paid to district councils, which are then expected to hand
funds on parishes.
At present, the association claims, local councillors do not draw expenses
for work inside parishes or communities, and many council clerks work
part-time. According to its estimates, parishes now only account for 0.3 per
cent of total local government spending.

FT  17 MAR 94 / London role as world city 'threatened'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
By John Willman,
Public Policy Editor
London's future as a world city has been weakened by the absence of a single
planning authority for the central business district, says Hillier Parker,
the firm of estate agents.
The 10 London boroughs responsible for planning in inner London have
designated less than half the central business area as part of the Central
Activities Zone where priority will be given to business and economic
development.
The London Planning Advisory Committee will today present its latest advice
to the government on how to develop the capital. The committee, which
represents all London local authorities, is expected to emphasise the
importance of the Central Activities Zone in London's continued success as a
world city.
Planners traditionally use the registrar-general's definition of London's
central business area  - which is based on demographic data revealing where
property is mainly non-residential (see map). However, much of this area has
been left outside the central activities zone as defined by the 10 boroughs.
This includes all of the central business area in the three boroughs on the
south bank of the Thames  - Wandsworth, Lambeth and Southwark. Islington,
which adjoins the City financial district, has designated only one small
area as part of the zone.
'Each of the 10 boroughs covering central London can say it has made
provision for business development,' says Mr John Parmiter of Hillier
Parker.
'But overall the picture is of a city that is shrinking and becoming more
fragmented in planning terms.'
As a result, London will find it harder to attract international businesses
to the capital, says Mr Parmiter.
Other European cities, such as Paris and Frankfurt, have single local
authorities that offer attractive packages to inward investors.
'Some of these boroughs appear to regard their central London areas as
distractions from their responsibilities to residents,' says Mr Parmiter.
'There is no agreement between them on what constitutes the central
activities zone. Camden excludes all but a small part of its area while
neighbouring Westminster casts the net far wider.'
Since the abolition of the Greater London Council in 1986, responsibility
for planning in central London has been divided between nine inner-city
boroughs and the City Corporation.
Each is completing its first unitary development plan setting out strategic
planning policies on matters such as areas to be designated for business
development. Little effort has been made to co-ordinate the 10 plans, says
Mr Parmiter.
Comparison of the 10 maps shows that neighbouring boroughs disagree on such
matters as the line of the underground railway and the route for new lines
such as CrossRail. Most of the boroughs' plans for the central area are too
advanced to be altered significantly.

The MPs are in a pivotal position after dissension among Tories. In the past
week the Labour leaders of 38 English and Welsh counties have called on the
party to drop its support for the review, claiming it will be a 'political
disaster' and will 'only weaken local government further by replacing
county-wide strategic services with joint boards and quangos'.
But the leaders of more than 100 Labour-led district councils have also
written to all Labour MPs urging them not to abandon the party's policy of
strong support for unitary councils that combine the functions carried out
at present by districts and counties. The letter says that MORI polls
carried out for the Local Government Commission showed a general majority of
two-to-one among voters in favour of the unitary principle.
Mr Jack Straw, shadow environment secretary, backs unitary authorities, and
said in a recent interview with the Municipal Journal that the party had
favoured unitary local government 'forever'. However, this approach is
deeply unpopular with the Association of County Councils, which has been
Labour-controlled. Some Labour spokesmen are now uncomfortable with this
line.

FT  17 MAR 94 / Confusion clouds labour statistics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The headline fall in February's seasonally adjusted unemployment total may
be good news  - but the detailed statistics published yesterday by the
Department of Employment display some confused signals of the strength of
the labour market.
One pattern which had been noticed during 1993 was that new jobs being
created were mostly part-time, and mostly for women. But some of the
department's figures appear to show that that trend has reversed.
The figures for employees in employment (collected from employers) show that
full-time employment rose by 19,000 between September and December, while
part-time employment fell by 5,000. However, the Labour Force Survey  - a
survey of 60,000 households  - seems to show the opposite.
The survey says that, between the summer and the autumn of 1993, part-time
employment rose by 90,000, while full-time employment fell by 17,000.
Although the statistics cover slightly different periods, the contradiction
is apparent.
The department's figures also show that, in the last three months of 1993,
the main cause of a 15,000 increase in people in employment came from a rise
in the self-employed.
The number of self-employed rose by 54,000, cancelling out a 52,000 fall in
the number of people in employment. An extra 23,000 people were on
work-related government training programmes, while 9,000 fewer were employed
in the armed forces.
The growth in self-employment has been fairly erratic, showing a 75,000 jump
between March and June 1993, but being virtually flat in the third quarter
of last year.
Some caveats also apply to the 38,800 fall  - to 2.75m  - in seasonally
adjusted unemployment in February. The employment department has changed the
seasonal adjustment for February. Under the old seasonal adjustment, the
figures would have shown a fall of just 18,800. The unadjusted total fell by
47,855 to 2.84m.
Furthermore, January's unexpected rise in unemployment has been revised
upwards, from 15,500 to 19,800. Manufacturing employment continues to fall,
recording a 13,000 drop in January. And vacancies at job centres increased
by only 400 in February, compared with an average monthly increase of 2,100
over the past six months.
Nevertheless, there were several good signs. The number of people joining
the unemployment register, at a seasonally adjusted 324,700, was the lowest
monthly figure since October 1990. The number of working days lost due to
industrial disputes in January was 2,000.
Overtime working in the manufacturing sector rose by 0.33m hours to 9.29m
hours per week in January, while short-time working fell slightly to 0.25m
hours per week.
Unemployment fell in all regions in February, for both men and women. East
Anglia has the lowest percentage of workforce unemployed, at 7.8 per cent.
With the south-west and the north, it has seen the biggest percentage drop
since January.
The north has the highest percentage of unemployment apart from Northern
Ireland, which has 13.2 per cent.
The Labour Force Survey shows that 205,000 people were made redundant in the
three months before its survey, a fall of 32,000 compared with the summer
1993 survey.
The survey continues to show an unemployment figure 57,000 higher than that
compiled from benefit claimants. According to the survey 24.9m people were
in employment in the autumn of last year.

FT  17 MAR 94 / April tax fears trim shop sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A fall in shop sales last month appeared to confirm that consumers are
holding back spending before tax rises in April. But a significant upwards
revision of January's figure means that the overall message from yesterday's
official retail sales figures is ambiguous.
The Central Statistical Office said that in February sales volumes fell by
0.5 per cent on the month, to stand 2.5 per cent up on a year ago. This was
the slowest year-on-year growth rate since May last year and compared with a
rate of 3.7 per cent in the year to January.
However, January's provisional increase in sales of 0.6 per cent was revised
upwards to 0.9 per cent, one of the strongest monthly rises in the last 12
months.
Earlier this week, the CBI's distributive trades survey showed two
consecutive months of slowing retail sales growth. That, with yesterday's
official February figure, may add to government concerns that tax increases
next month will take the wind out of the recovery.
On the other hand, the trends in the latest three months indicate that there
is enough momentum in consumer demand to weather the effects of fiscal
tightening. In the three months to February the volume of sales was 0.6 per
cent higher than in the previous three months, and 3.4 per cent higher than
in the same period a year earlier.
The only sector that saw a rise in sales in February was food retailing, up
0.7 per cent.
The 'other non-food' category  - which covers the more discretionary side of
spending  - suffered the biggest drop in sales. It fell 1.2 per cent on the
month and within this category, household goods  - big ticket items  -
dropped 1.6 per cent, after a 3.5 per cent rise in January.

FT  17 MAR 94 / Scottish unemployment forecast to exceed 10%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unemployment in Scotland, which fell 0.1 per cent in February to 9.3 per
cent, was yesterday predicted to rise to 10.1 per cent by the end of the
year.
The rise will come as companies responded to increasing price competition by
shedding permanent staff and making more use of overtime, says the
prediction, which comes from the Fraser of Allander Institute of Strathclyde
University, Scotland's main economic forecaster.
It implies that Scotland will have a slightly higher unemployment rate
during recovery than it experienced during the recent recession. Seasonally
adjusted unemployment peaked early last year at 9.9 per cent.
The institute believes that the number of people employed will fall by about
20,000 by the end of 1994, with service industries losing 11,000 jobs and
manufacturing shedding between 4,500 and 5,000 jobs.
The institute says falls in employment are not matched by equivalent rises
in registered unemployment, possibly because of people going into part-time
work, or retiring.
It expects unemployment to rise by about 5,000 by the end of the year. The
unemployment rate will fall again in 1995 as output increases further.
Manufacturing output, which grew by 2.2 per cent in 1993, should rise by 3.3
per cent in 1994.
While the Scottish economy would benefit from improved export prospects and
lower interest rates, the benefits would be offset by the effect of value
added tax on heating bills and proportionately greater curbs on public
expenditure.

FT  17 MAR 94 / PSBR lower than expected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government borrowed Pounds 4.6bn in February to finance public-sector
spending, taking the public sector borrowing requirement for the first 11
months of the financial year 1993-94 to Pounds 34.7bn.
The monthly figure was lower than the Pounds 6.7bn economists expected,
because of larger-than-usual borrowing repayments by local authorities and
privatisation proceeds of Pounds 0.7bn, mainly from the British
Telecommunications share issue. It is unlikely the PSBR for the year will
reach the Pounds 49.8bn forecast by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, in
the November budget.
Mr Simon Briscoe, economist at SG Warburg Securities, said: 'This is good
news because it points to lower-than-expected government spending. Investors
in gilts should be reassured because it promises lower government borrowing
and so a lower rate of issuance over the next year.'
Yesterday's figures from the Central Statistical Office showed that central
government borrowing was Pounds 5.1bn in February, making a total of Pounds
39.8bn for the first 11 months of 1993-94, compared with Pounds 35bn for the
same period in 1992-93.

FT  17 MAR 94 / Rise in rate of average earnings causes concern
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An increase in the annual growth rate of average earnings  - the first rise
since February 1992  - raised fears that a long period of subdued wage rises
might be over.
The underlying annual increase in earnings in the 12 months to January was
3.25 per cent. This was the same as the revised figure for December, which
had previously been announced as 3 per cent. The annual growth rate had been
steadily declining since the 7.5 per cent recorded in February 1992.
In the manufacturing and production sectors, underlying earnings rose 4.5
per cent in the 12 months to January, up from 4.25 per cent in December.
The increase in service-sector earnings in the year to January was 3 per
cent, up from 2.75 per cent in December and the third consecutive monthly
rise.
The Department of Employment estimates the underlying rise in earnings by
making adjustments for other influences such as pay arrears and variations
in the timing of settlements.
The actual increase in earnings in the year to January was 3.6 per cent.
The department said there was little evidence of an increase in the general
level of pay settlements, so the most likely explanation for the rise was
increased bonus payments.
Mr Simon Briscoe, UK economist at SG Warburg Securities, said: 'As the trend
cannot easily be explained, and given the weakness elsewhere in the labour
market, it is hard to get too concerned at this stage. The uptrend will not
be strong.'
Mr Michael Saunders, UK economist at Salomon Brothers International, said:
'The rise in average earnings is not yet large enough to threaten the
inflation outlook. It is only if the rise is a step on the way up to a level
between 4 per cent and 5 per cent that it poses problems to the low
inflation outlook. As yet, there is no sign that wage deals are rising that
sharply.'
The rise in earnings meant that unit labour costs have also increased. In
the year to January wages and salaries per unit of output in the
manufacturing sector rose by 1.7 per cent, compared with 1 per cent in the
year to December.
In the three months to January unit wage costs in the manufacturing sector
were 1.3 per cent higher than in the same three months a year ago.
Productivity is still improving, however. Output per head rose by 3 per cent
in the year to January, compared with 2.9 per cent in the 12 months to
December.

Fears about global warming and many other environmental threats are
exaggerated, economists claim today.
The main cause of warming of about 0.5`C in the earth's temperature over the

atmosphere, say the authors of a book from the Institute of Economic

Average water bills in houses with water meters will fall by 1 per cent to
Pounds 97 in the year 1994-95, according to Ofwat, the water industry
regulator. Average sewerage bills will fall by 3.8 per cent to Pounds 102,
Bronwen Maddox writes.
The watchdog said the fall was partly because metered customers used an
average of 11 per cent less water.
Average water bills in households without water meters will be Pounds 94 - a
rise of 6.8 per cent. Average sewerage bills will be Pounds 105, a rise of
8.2 per cent.

FT  17 MAR 94 / Sales fall as shoppers wait for tax rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An abrupt fall in shop sales last month appeared to confirm that consumers
are holding back spending ahead of higher taxes in April. But a significant
upwards revision of January's figure means that the overall message from
yesterday's official retail sales figures is ambiguous.
The Central Statistical Office said that in February, sales volumes fell by
0.5 per cent on the month, to stand 2.5 per cent up on a year ago. This was
the slowest year-on-year growth rate since May last year and compared with a
rate of 3.7 per cent in the year to January.
However, January's provisional increase in sales of 0.6 per cent was revised
upwards to 0.9 per cent, one of the strongest monthly rises in the last 12
months.
Earlier this week, the CBI's distributive trades survey showed two
consecutive months of slowing retail sales growth. That, together with
yesterday's official February figure may add to government concerns that tax
increases next month will take the wind out of the recovery.
On the other hand, the trends in the latest three months indicate that there
is enough momentum in consumer demand to weather the effects of fiscal
tightening. In the three months to February the volume of sales was 0.6 per
cent higher than in the previous three months, and 3.4 per cent higher than
in the same period a year earlier.
The only sector that saw a rise in sales in February was food retailing, up
0.7 per cent after a flat January.
The 'other non-food' category - which covers the more discretionary side of
spending - suffered the biggest drop in sales. It fell 1.2 per cent on the
month, and within this category, household goods - big ticket items -
dropped 1.6 per cent, after a 3.5 per cent rise in January. Mixed retail
sales volumes fell 1 per cent.
Sales by clothing and footwear retailers fell 0.4 per cent in February,
reversing January's 0.3 per cent rise.
Yesterday's figures received mixed interpretations from analysts. Economists
at James Capel said the figures show that spending was being increasingly
concentrated in months such as January, when discounts are available, at the
expense of February. Since the CSO's seasonal adjustment was unlikely to
pick this trend up, the official data probably overstated the true level of
sales in January and understated them in February.
The British Chambers of Commerce said the figures show that the economy was
performing better now than a year ago.

Constructions Mecaniques de Normandie, the French-based shipbuilder, said
yesterday that it would make a bid within a week for Swan Hunter, the
Tyneside shipbuilder in receivership.
The bid is likely to be conditional on the yard winning the Ministry of
Defence contract for the refit of the landing ship Sir Bedivere. CMN said
its bid for Swan Hunter would be made before Thursday March 24, the deadline
for tender submission for the contract.
Price Waterhouse, Swan Hunter's receivers, was optimistic it would receive a
bid for the company, possibly but not necessarily from CMN, before the
tender deadline.
The receivers expect any bid will be conditional on Swan Hunter winning the
Sir Bedivere refit, which again pins the survival of north-east England's
last shipbuilder on the award of a keenly contested MoD contract.
It was Swan Hunter's failure to win a MoD helicopter carrier order, after it
bid Pounds 71m more than a rival VSEL-Kvaerner Govan consortium, which
plunged the Tyneside company into receivership last May.
The 18-month Sir Bedivere refit, worth about Pounds 30m, will provoke
another fierce fight. Tenders have been invited from Swan Hunter, VSEL,
Yarrow, the Devonport and Rosyth naval dockyards, Appledore and Tees
Dockyard.
Yesterday Mr Ed James, joint receiver, said: 'We are accepting the award of
the Sir Bedivere to Swan's is likely to be a condition of any bid to buy the
company.'
He said Swan Hunter was formulating the 'most competitive and compliant' bid
possible. Since receivership, the company has cut overheads, shedding nearly
1,500 jobs. Swan Hunter's tender must be underwritten by a prospective
purchaser guaranteeing completion to cost and on time.
Mr Fred Henderson, leader of the CMN bid team, said: 'We would expect to be
submitting a bid prior to the closing date for the Sir Bedivere tender.' He
is aiming for early next week. 'It's all going to be last-ditch stuff.'
Swan Hunter's current workload is two frigates to be handed over in May and
November. Without Sir Bedivere, the company would be 'very unattractive',
said Mr Henderson. He added that CMN was still considering whether to make
its bid conditional on winning the refit.
Mr James said that while CMN had been overt about its bid preparation,
'others have done it quietly', and could yet move before Thursday.
Union leaders at Swan Hunter will lobby Tory MPs in London next week.
Failure to win the refit of Sir Bedivere would be 'catastrophic', said Mr
Dick Gonzales, chairman of Swan's Confederation of Shipbuilding and
Engineering Unions.

FT  17 MAR 94 / Defence minister sees scope to cut more
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More cuts can be made in spending on the armed forces without reducing
Britain's overall defence capability, Viscount Cranborne, junior defence
minister, told the Lords last night, Ivor Owen writes.
He said work on the latest defence costs study had been in progress for
three months, and it was hoped to make the outcome known by July.
Lord Cranborne rejected demands by Labour and Liberal Democrat peers,
supported by Field Marshal Lord Bramall, a former chief of the Defence Staff
from the cross-benches, for a full defence review.
The minister insisted that such a review would be 'irrelevant' at a time
when events were moving so swiftly.
He reaffirmed that the defence of British territory, including the Falkland
Islands, was the first priority of the government's defence policy.
Lord Bramall warned that studies made with the objective of securing
financial savings and very little else were no way to get 'the right
answer'.

FT  17 MAR 94 / MPs demand pensioners on trustee boards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A cross-party committee of MPs has called for new laws to force companies to
include pensioners on the boards of trustees of corporate pension schemes
and to raise employee representation to half of all trustees.
The committee also called for laws to bar companies from winding up pension
schemes without the consent of a new pensions regulator and for regulations
requiring employers to seek the permission of their employees before
transferring them to a new scheme.
The recommendations, in a report by the Commons social security committee,
go well beyond those made by the government's Pension Law Review Committee.
The government is considering that report and is preparing legislation for
regulatory reform.
The Commons committee accused Mirror Group Newspapers of failing to honour
pension commitments to thousands of former scheme members who were employed
by other companies controlled by Robert Maxwell.
In June 1991, the trustees of the MGN scheme agreed that such schemes should
be amalgamated with their own. The assets of these schemes never reached the
MGN scheme. MGN's position is that it will only honour pension commitments
to its own employees. Mr Frank Field, Labour chairman of the committee, said
he was 'looking at ways to force MGN to honour the agreement by the previous
trustees of the scheme'.
MGN's pension scheme has been the most successful of all the former Maxwell
company schemes in obtaining the return of missing assets  - Pounds 57m in
assets have been returned, reducing MGN's liability significantly. The
committee is urging that the refunded sums be used to finance pensions for
the excluded scheme members.
Mr Field expressed concern about fees earned by legal firms, insolvency
practitioners and others in sorting out the Maxwell empire. 'The sum is
Pounds 77m and rising,' he said.
While praising efforts to seek a 'global settlement' in which securities
firms voluntarily return pension scheme assets, Mr Field said greater haste
was needed. 'It is very crucial that those who are part of the global
settlement can distinguish the wood from the fees,' he said.
He also called on MGN to help pensioners rather than taking part in the
consortium to take over The Independent. 'At a time when MGN believes itself
to be so financially solvent that it can attempt to take over another
newspaper, most people in the country would have thought their first
priority was to meet their responsibilities to pensioners rather than extend
their empire.'
Mirror Group Newspapers last night attacked Mr Field's 'disgraceful and
untrue comments' and said it was considering legal action for defamation.
Some of Mr Field's comments were made at a press conference. MGN added:
'Every single person who works at MGN has committed, for the next 11 years,
to bend their backs in order to repay to the rightful owners the hundreds of
millions of pounds stolen by Robert Maxwell.'

FT  17 MAR 94 / How to lose friends in Europe - Political Notebook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Mr John Major replaced the then Mrs Margaret Thatcher, Mr Douglas Hurd
took the opportunity to review the way Britain handled negotiations with its
European partners.
The foreign secretary had long deprecated the former prime minister's
bargaining style. She too often found herself in less-than-glorious
isolation.
There were solemn declarations that she would never back down, confident
assertions that the rest of Europe was isolated and frequent public
tantrums. Then of course came the retreat.
So Mr Hurd sent his colleagues some guidelines to help them occasionally to
win the argument in Brussels. It was pretty basic stuff: the sort of advice
found in cheap paperbacks on winning friends and influencing people.
Ministers should not show all of their cards at the outset. They should work
at building new alliances. They should listen as well as speak. They should
not stake out publicly a bottom line from which they would be forced to
retreat.
More than one minister thought such rules so blindingly obvious as to be not
worth writing down. Now it is Mr Hurd who is breaking them.
The impasse this week over the supposed 'dilution' of British authority in
the European Union's Council of Ministers bore all the depressing hallmarks
of the Thatcher era.
The government sets out what it states to be an immovable position. It
becomes progressively isolated. It then prepares for the climbdown, relying
on its partners for a figleaf to hide its embarrassment.
The latest argument is about the arcane but important issue of how many
countries can block a decision when the European Union acts through
qualified majority voting.
At present the 12 countries share a total of 76 votes. Larger countries have
10 each and smaller ones five or fewer. For a measure to pass it must secure
54 votes. That means 23 votes  - two big countries and one small  -
constitute a blocking majority.
But when the four new entrants  - Austria, Finland, Sweden and Norway - join
the European Union the total number of votes will rise to 90. Fairly
predictably, Britain's partners  - with the exception for complicated
reasons of Spain  - want the block-ing minority to rise proportionately to
27 votes.
Mr Major's government has combined passionate advocacy of enlargement - a
wider Union means a less centralised Union  - with a refusal to countenance
any dilution of its own influence.
It has couched the argument in terms of preserving the system whereby two
large and one small country can together muster a veto with 23 votes  -
though in reality Mr Hurd has deeper but unacknowledged concerns that the
present voting system is heavily biased in favour of the smaller nations in
the Union.
Either way, the issue has been elevated into one of great principle. The
absurd notion that it is a battle against fiendish federalists has in turn
fuelled the Euro-sceptic fire on the Tory backbenches
Unsurprisingly, Mr Hurd has found himself outmanoeuvred. Britain's partners
will not accept the enlargement that the government wants without the voting
change. But a large chunk of the Tory party now sees the change as an
unacceptable encroachment on British sovereignty.
The party's pro-European wing meanwhile is furious that the government is
cast once again as the obstructionist of Europe. So Europhobes and
Europhiles are both predicting another civil war in the Conservative party
before the June elections for the European Parliament.
Mr Hurd is confident he can still pull his hands from the fire: that a deal
can be concocted that will satisfy the rest of the Union and be sold at the
same time to most Conservative MPs. Enlargement will go ahead and the
fragile facade of party unity will be put together again.
The foreign secretary's friends are vehement in his defence. By fighting his
corner with vigour he will ensure the resultant deal, whatever it is, will
be much better than it otherwise would have been.
But others whisper that Mr Hurd should not be blamed. He was locked into an
aggressive stance by the combative instincts of Mr Kenneth Clarke, the
chancellor, and the weakness of Mr Major.
But for pro-European Conservatives the saga has exposed a depressingly
defeatist view of Britain's place in Europe. It has conducted the debate as
if it will always be part of a minority  - seeking to block rather than to
promote decisions.
It has admitted tacitly it has little hope of winning over the Union's new
entrants to the cause of a liberal, decentralised Europe. What is left is a
strategy designed to reinforce Britain's capacity to obstruct.
So Mr Hurd has stirred up the antagonisms in his own party and given further
cause for Britain's partners to doubt its commitment to Europe. Sooner or
later  - and probably next week  - the sticking plaster of compromise will
be applied. In the interim Mr Hurd might consider re-issuing his negotiating
rulebook  - and then reading it.

FT  17 MAR 94 / Inland Revenue bans annuity plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
  By GILLIAN O'CONNOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Inland Revenue has banned an innovative type of annuity which was
designed to helped pensioners cope with the effects of falling interest
rates, Gillian O'Connor writes.
Sales of 'managed' or 'flexible' annuities by Equitable Life, the life
company, have been halted and pensioners who have taken out such annuities
may have to make alternative arrangements.
The sharp fall in interest rates over the past few years means pensioners
taking out a conventional annuity now might receive an income which was
between 25 per cent and 30 per cent lower than those who took out their
annuities a couple of years ago.
Last October Equitable Life introduced a new annuity product which allowed
pensioners to choose what level of income they wanted to take out of their
pension fund in particular years or to take out a conventional annuity at a
time of their own choosing.

FT  17 MAR 94 / Road body sell-off plans criticised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Plans to privatise the Transport Research Laboratory were strongly
criticised yesterday by the Conservative-controlled Commons transport
committee.
The MPs said they would refuse to recommend the privatisation to the Commons
until they received 'much more convincing' assurances about the laboratory's
independence. The report is a severe blow to Mr John MacGregor, the
transport secretary, who has said that privatisation is 'a feasible option'.
The government will also be embarrassed by disclosures in the report that
the committee's strong line was prompted by Mr Peter Bottomley, Conservative
MP for Eltham and a former transport minister.
Mr Bottomley joined the Labour minority on the seven-strong committee to
amend a resolution criticising the privatisation proposals to make it clear
that they lacked justification.
The committee also drew the government's attention to evidence given by the
Association of Chief Police Officers which suggested that privatisation
would reduce safety standards on Britain's roads.
Privatisation of the laboratory, which advises the Department of Transport
and other customers on transport issues, was recommended by an inquiry
carried out for Mr MacGregor by KPMG Corporate Finance. The inquiry said
that the retention of the laboratory in the public sector 'would risk it
being unable to respond adequately to changes in its market' and would
present a 'considerable risk' of a cycle of cumulative decline.

FT  17 MAR 94 / Inter-party row deepens over council tax levels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ and JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Conservative and Labour politicians were yesterday engaged in an
increasingly bitter spat over the amount of council tax to be levied by
local authorities. Signs that the issue will dominate campaigning for May's
local elections have fuelled the row.
Ministers again accused Labour authorities of 'waste, mismanagment and
inefficiency', arguing that they would charge more than their Tory
counterparts in each of the council tax's eight property bands. Labour tried
to shoot down the Tories' figures, claiming that they were 'spurious' and
that the only sensible comparison of council tax levels was to be found in
the average council tax per dwelling. These figures show Labour councils
charging less than the Tories and Liberal Democrats.
Sides paraded their different claims in the House of Commons yesterday
afternoon.
Mr David Curry, local government minister, said that he could think of no
less sensible way of expressing the payments than an average, 'be-cause
nobody pays an average tax'. He added: 'Whether you are with modest means
and a modest house, whether you have got a middle-income and a middle-band
house, or even if you are relatively well off in Band H, you are always
paying less under Conservative than you do under Labour or under Liberal
Democrat councils.'
Mr Jack Straw, shadow environment secretary, said that both the Department
of the Environment and Tory central office had used average figures in March
last year when setting out the impact of the tax.
'Did central office use those figures before they discovered that average
household council tax bills per dwelling are Pounds 40 lower in Labour areas
than they are in Conservative areas?' asked Mr Straw.
A Labour official said yesterday that the council tax issue was one on which
his party was unlikely to win. But he said the aim of Labour's campaign was
to ensure that the government did not score an easy victory.

FT  17 MAR 94 / Bus group rages at 'naive OFT'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Office of Fair Trading yesterday ruled that Fife Scottish Omnibuses, a
subsidiary of the quoted bus company Stagecoach, had 'preyed on' a rival by
registering loss-making commercial services on routes where the other
company operated subsidised services.
Fife Scottish immediately accused the OFT of naivety and said its report
contained 'inaccuracies, half-truths and outright misrepresentation'.
Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, said he was satisfied
that Fife Scottish's behaviour was predatory and that its intention was to
displace its rival, Moffat &amp; Williamson, the Fife company which brought the
complaint.
Fife Scottish said the complaint concerned only six services and that those
services had come to an end last August, before the OFT inquiry began.
Stagecoach operates subsidiaries in many parts of Britain and its
subsidiaries have frequently been subject to investigations by the OFT. Some
of these have resulted in the companies giving undertakings to the OFT.
Mr Jim Moffat, Fife Scottish's managing director, said he was concerned that
'a supposedly impartial body could come up with such a mish-mash of
inaccuracies, half-truths and outright misrepresentation of the facts and
background of this case'.
He accused the OFT of ignoring what Fife Scottish had told it. 'The naivety
of the OFT continues to surprise me and some of the financial reasoning in
this report is quite ludicrous in the context of bus operations,' he said.
The OFT said last night that the fact that the services complained of no
longer operated was immaterial. It would be seeking undertakings from Fife
Scottish that it would not register loss-making services on subsidised
routes in the future. If it did not receive such undertakings the issue
would be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
It could not comment on Fife Scottish's views on its report.
Mr Derek Scott, finance director of Stagecoach, said that the issue was not
of material importance either to Stagecoach or to Fife Scottish, which has
an annual turnover of Pounds 17m.
Moffat &amp; Williamson welcomed the report.

FT  17 MAR 94 / Ministers seek to calm Tory fears on IRA
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is preparing a charm offensive aimed at reassuring
Conservative backbenchers about its Northern Ireland policy in the wake of
recent terrorist attacks.
Mr Michael Ancram, Northern Ireland minister, is offering to meet Tory MPs
with specific concerns about the province individually or in small groups
from next week.
Many Conservatives are keen to add their weight to mounting unionist calls
for a security clampdown in response to the latest surge in mainland
terrorism by the IRA. They are understood to be disappointed with the
government's response to date.
A top-level committee of cabinet ministers met secretly at Westminster this
week to discuss the security situation. The Northern Ireland Office is
thought, however, to be reluctant to countenance radical new
counter-terrorist measures at such a delicate point in the Anglo-Irish peace
initiative.
Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, will have a fresh
opportunity to gauge the strength of backbench feeling today, when he meets
the generally pro-unionist officers of the Tory backbench Northern Ireland
committee. This routine get-together will come immediately after Northern
Ireland questions in the Commons, when members of the opposition parties
will grill Sir Patrick on recent events.
The backbench Northern Ireland committee will meet at Westminster later in
the afternoon, after which it is thought MPs might press for a meeting with
Mr John Major, the prime minister.
Meanwhile, the cross-party Commons selection committee expects to decide
next week which MPs are to sit on the new Northern Ireland select committee
in a move which could pave the way for the body to start work soon after
Easter.
The decision to set up the select committee is widely seen as a
reinforcement of the government's commitment to the province's unionist
majority.

FT  17 MAR 94 / Crossed Lamont stops ex-chequer Healey
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Never again will Lord Healey's finger be extended for a sympathetic shop
assistant to hang a wrapped CD from it. No longer will the former chancellor
walk out of a record shop and flinch at the sight of a Thresher's
off-licence.
A campaign of television commercials for debit cards starring the Labour
elder statesman has been scrapped by The Independent Television Commission
after it received a complaint from Mr Norman Lamont, a former Conservative
chancellor.
The commercials illustrate making purchases without cheques and are
accompanied by billboard posters describing Lord Healey as an 'ex-chequer'.
On television, he buys a CD, potters into the street and confronts the
Thresher's sign. The voiceover says that the Visa Delta debit card is so
simple that even chancellors of the exchequer can understand it. Newspaper
reports last year alleged that Mr Lamont had bought wine and cigarettes at a
particular branch of the Thresher's off-licence chain with his credit card.
Mr Lamont is not referred to in the Healey commercial, but the commission
said: 'He clearly believed (the advertisement) referred to him, and other
people agreed with him.'
Asked about the advertisement at Westminster yesterday, Mr Lamont said: 'The
whole Thresher incident was a lie and a fabrication of certain newspapers. I
do not see why a lie should be perpetuated in an advertisement.'
The ITC said it upheld Mr Lamont's complaint because the advertisement
breached its rules on privacy. Under the ITC's code permission has to be
sought from individuals portrayed.
Visa International said yesterday the advertising campaign had been 'highly
successful in improving cardholder understanding of Visa Delta' and was only
intended to run until yesterday.

The reforms have led to gains, but the institute's report says that old

Extra medical care has been provided for more than 100 asylum seekers on
hunger strike at the Campsfield House Immigration Detention Centre, near
Oxford, the Home Office said last night.
About 150 people from Asia, Africa and South America have been refusing to
eat in protest at being 'treated like prisoners'. They want the authorities
to free them while their cases are processed.

FT  17 MAR 94 / Sheerness ferry service to end
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Olau Line, the German shipping company, is to end its ferry service between
Sheerness in Kent and Vlissingen in the Netherlands.
Mersey Docks and Harbour, which owns Sheerness Docks, yesterday declined to
comment on the impact of the decision, but figures given to employees before
it took over Medway Ports in September suggest that the service contributed
about 11 per cent of turnover of Pounds 31m in 1991.
The Pounds 103m takeover caused a row because 270 dockers dismissed three
months before for refusing to accept new work practices had been obliged to
sell back shares to the company for Pounds 2.50, while the takeover price
was Pounds 37.25 a share.

FT  17 MAR 94 / Price-cut delay for Mercury callers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mercury's business customers may be paying more for their telephone calls
than if they used British Telecommunications, because of a long delay by
Mercury in matching recent BT price cuts, Andrew Adonis writes.
Earlier this month BT abolished its peak-rate for calls made between 9am and
1pm on weekdays. Mercury has failed to abolish its peak rate for customers
with direct Mercury connections  - which includes most City businesses  -
and will not do so until March 31.
Mercury abolished its peak rate for customers with indirect Mercury
connections on the same day as BT but not for directly connected customers.
Mercury's standard tariffs for direct customers are now higher than BT's for
calls made between 9am and 1pm.
Mr Graham Mariner, chairman of the Telecommunications Managers' Association,
which represents large users, said he had not been aware of Mercury's delay.
'Most companies would probably have missed this, and some may be paying over
the odds,' he said.
Mercury said the delay was caused by the need to file tariff changes for
directly connected customers with Oftel, the industry regulator, 28 days in
advance. BT filed its abolition of the peak rate on February 7. Mercury
filed its matching price cut on March 3. 'It was about as speedy as we could
go,' Mercury said.

FT  17 MAR 94 / More promises made on public service quality
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government claimed yesterday that the Citizen's Charter had
significantly raised the standard of public services and promised more than
a hundred further improvements in quality.
A report on progress under the charter said improvements in public services
included reductions in waiting times for hospital operations, more
information for parents on children's school progress and increasing
punctuality in rail services.
In a foreword to the report, Mr John Major, the prime minister, said he
wanted to see all services aiming for the best standards. 'I expect the best
to go on raising their standards year by year,' he added.
The charter's record was challenged by Mr Michael Meacher, shadow public
service minister. He said many targets had been missed and the charter
overlooked important services such as legal aid and childcare. He called for
real sanctions to give people power to alter services to meet their needs.
'An idea of real potential value has been swamped by PR gloss to mask the
steady deterioration of so many public services,' he said.
Mr William Waldegrave, public service minister, said the charter was a
10-year programme to improve services. 'These reforms are now gaining
momentum and will bring yet further benefits over time,' he added.
The report included more than a hundred new commitments to further raise
service standards, including:
Patients whose National Health Service operations are cancelled will be
guaranteed re-admission to hospital within a month.
Council tenants who improve their homes will get compensation.
Every further education college will produce charters.
Parents of children with special education needs will get extra choice.
More radical improvements in patients' rights are promised for Scotland and
Wales. In Scotland, maximum waiting times for hospital admission after being
seen by a consultant are to be reduced from 18 months to a year by 1997.
In Wales, health authorities are considering a guarantee that covers the
maximum wait between first seeing a doctor and having an operation.
Systems for dealing with complaints would be overhauled, the report said. A
Complaints Task Force headed by Lady Wilcox, chairman of the National
Consumer Council, is to be set up.

FT  17 MAR 94 / Foreign gangs 'rule organised crime'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is no single UK gang dominant in organised crime, the Commons home
affairs committee was told yesterday.
Home Office and Customs and Excise officials told the committee that,
leaving Northern Ireland aside, hundreds of crime syndicates were involved
in everything from extortion and lorry hijacking to drugs. But there was no
dominant group like the Mafia in Italy.
The main operators in the UK were often tentacles of international
syndicates like the Mafia, the Triads and the Colombian cartels.
These groups, increasingly joined by gangs from the former Soviet Union and
Eastern Europe, are often involved in drug trafficking and money laundering.
Estimating the extent of organised crime is hampered by the lack of a broad
definition in UK law of organised crime  - such as that in the US law
against racketeering.
Officials defined organised crime as a group activity whose prime purpose is
the achievement of large-scale profits through criminal acts, which is
long-term and continuing and includes some form of self-perpetuating
criminal structure.
Home Office officials estimated that between Pounds 2.5bn and Pounds 4bn was
laundered in the UK in 1992. Customs and Excise officials estimated that in
the year to April 1993, the value of drugs prevented from entering the UK
was Pounds 896m. There were about 9,000 drug seizures and 47 drug rings were
broken up.

FT  17 MAR 94 / BR franchises right on track
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Private bidders for British Rail franchises should not be deterred by the
apparently high track access charges, Mr Bob Horton, chairman of Railtrack,
which will take over BR's track, said yesterday.
He told the Railway Study Association that commentators had suggested that
high track charges would mean that a significant proportion of the operating
companies' costs would be outside their control.
But this should not be a problem: 'In many businesses controllable costs are
a relatively small proportion of total costs. Some of our most successful
retailing companies have made a fortune from very narrow margins. Even the
oil companies exist on the narrowest of margins, paying most of their rent
to governments and royalty owners.'
The argument that franchisees needed to be able to control their costs had
been used to back calls for train operators to be allowed to own the track.
But the network could not be broken up into self-contained vertically
integrated franchises because many different services used the same track,
he said.

FT  17 MAR 94 / Greater changes to NHS urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Too much rust remains in the mechanism of the government's National Health
Service reforms and further changes are needed, the free-market Adam Smith
Institute argues today.
The reforms have led to gains but the institute's report says that old
relationships between purchasers and providers had been carried into the new
system and many of the same personalities were running the service.
The institute calls for district health authorities to be turned into fully
independent provident trusts, competing with fundholding general
practitioners for the right to purchase health care. This would provide
patients with freedom of choice and there was no reason why many aspects of
purchasing, including the assessment of local needs, could not eventually be
contracted out to non-public agencies.
GP fundholders, suggests the report, are likely to lead a movement of
structural change away from hospitals, with far more services provided in
community clinics. But much of the capital to finance such a shift would
have to come from the private sector.
The institute says: 'With a decade of experience behind us, it is time to
acknowledge the savings in time and money derived from employing private
sector management skills on infrastructure projects far outweigh any derived
from the idea that the government can always borrow more cheaply.
Fundholders have to be allowed full access to private sector capital.'

FT  17 MAR 94 / Leasing industry attacks Treasury transport policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The leasing industry is unlikely to back any private-sector transport
projects if the Treasury sticks to its present financing guidelines, Mr Tony
Mallin, chairman of the Finance and Leasing Association said yesterday.
He said leasing companies had the ability to write Pounds 5bn worth of
railway equipment business but had been disappointed at the failure of the
government's private finance initiative. Proposals for a Pounds 440m deal to
finance new trains for London Underground's Northern Line are stalled
because they do not meet Treasury guidelines.
Mr Mallin said the only way the leasing industry would be able to finance
deals was if it could negotiate special terms for deals which reduced the
risk assumed. 'The leasing industry is not yet willing to do deals because
we are being asked to finance risks we are not familiar with,' he said. 'We
would have hoped to have more projects to take forward.'
The industry is unsure whether a viable second-hand market for rolling stock
and other assets can be created. Leasing companies base charges partly on
the expectation that leased equipment will have a residual value when a
lease comes to an end and can be sold. In sectors funded by leasing, such as
cars and aircraft, there are active second-hand markets.
Under guidelines announced by the Treasury last year the private sector must
take on about 10 per cent of the risk - about equivalent to the residual
value of the asset when all lease payments have been made - of deals valued
at up to Pounds 1m. This rises to 30 per cent on deals worth between Pounds
1m and Pounds 10m and to 'the greater majority of risk' - normally
interpreted to mean 60 per cent to 70 per cent - on deals worth more than
Pounds 10m.

FT  17 MAR 94 / MPs question PIA's standing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MPs on the cross-party Treasury committee yesterday expressed doubts that
the new investor protection watchdog would inspire public confidence.
Taking evidence from Lautro, the existing regulator for the life insurance
industry, MPs highlighted the role of Mr Joe Palmer, chairman of the new
personal investment authority.
Mr Brian Sedgemore, a Labour committee member, asked whether Mr Palmer
should be seen in the category of people of the highest quality on whom the
regulatory system depended.
Legal &amp; General, the life insurance company where Mr Palmer was formerly
chief executive, recently attracted a record fine from Lautro for a
widespread and systemic failure to meet regulators' requirements.
Mr Barry Sherlock, Lautro chairman, said that the important issue was the
way in which a company dealt with weaknesses that had been identified.
He said: 'As a result of the work we have done over the last five years, no
single company has a totally clear record.'
He admitted but sought to minimise the risk that the PIA might find it
difficult to establish public confidence, emphasising instead the progress
made in setting up the PIA since Mr Palmer had been appointed.
Mr Giles Radice, another Labour committee member, suggested that the PIA
might find taking on staff from existing regulators a barrier to creating
confidence.
Mr Sherlock said existing staff were skilled and experienced. Without them
the PIA would be 'a disaster'.
Asked why it took so long to agree on disclosure of the commission on life
insurance products, Mr Sherlock cited the need to work with the Securities
and Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Caribbean rum producers are visiting several European capitals next week to
urge the European Union to increase its rum quota in the short term and
eventually abolish it altogether.
Producers says there is a rum shortage in the EU but they are facing growing
opposition from France to any increase in shipments.
The West Indies Rum and Spirits Producers' Association alleges that the
French prime minister has told the European Commission that France is
against any changes to the current quota and will not support its abolition.
The Caribbean producers are asking for a 10 per cent increase in the quota
of 214,000 hectolitres per year, and the abolition of the quota by 1996.
The conditions for access to the European rum market are contained in a
protocol of the Lome Convention, a trade and aid treaty between the Union
and the African, Caribbean and Pacific group of countries.
The rum producers have criticised the EU for being slow to honour legal
commitments to react automatically by increasing the access for rum to meet
growing demand.

FT  17 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Banana row may end soon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Costa Rica is expected to agree on Monday to a plan put forward by the
European Union for increasing its access to the EU banana market.
The agreement would mark the end of a bitter dispute between the EU and
Latin American banana suppliers which has soured relations since last July.
The deal would mean exporters could ship 2.1m tonnes of Latin American
bananas to the EU this year rather than the current 2m tonnes, rising to
2.2m tonnes next year.
Latin American banana exporters complained to the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade about the EU's arrangements for the banana trade. Their
complaint was upheld by a Gatt panel which ruled the EU's trading deal for
bananas with African, Caribbean and Pacific countries under the Lome
Convention ran counter to Gatt rules.
The EU has made its offer of a greater quota for Latin American fruit
conditional on exporters dropping their Gatt complaint. Colombia, Nicaragua
and Venezuela have all agreed to the EU's new plan.
The panel report on bananas will be discussed at a Gatt council meeting next
Tuesday and Wednesday. Costa Rica, still hoping for last minute concessions,
has indicated it could signal its agreement on Monday which would remove the
panel report from the agenda.
Guatemala, the other Gatt complainant, is unlikely to agree but represents
only 1.5 per cent of the market and the Commission has indicated that the
new plan could go ahead if the four main suppliers agreed.

FT  17 MAR 94 / World Trade News: US stalls over BA-USAir code-sharing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The British and US governments yesterday continued the tense diplomatic
poker game over the future of airline services between the two countries as
today's deadline for US renewal of a ticket code-sharing agreement between
British Airways and USAir approached.
Airline lobbyists on both sides of the Atlantic were anxiously scrambling to
find out whether the US Department of Transportation would finally renew the
BA-USAir code-sharing arrangement or provoke an airline trade war between
the two countries by withdrawing the British carrier's code-sharing rights.
Under intense pressure from some of its biggest carriers, including American
Airlines and Delta Air Lines, the US authorities have also threatened to
renounce the existing aviation agreement between the two countries, a move
which would badly damage US-UK relations and undermine both countries'
efforts to liberalise international air transport.
The UK has already warned Washington it would retaliate swiftly against a
decision not to renew BA's code-sharing rights with its US airline partner
or to renew them only for a very short period.
This is likely to involve restrictions on flights by American Airlines and
United Airlines into London's Heathrow airport.
In turn, such a move would inevitably lead to an escalation in trade
tensions, with the US restricting flights by UK carriers into its market,
threatening to provoke even more disruption for transatlantic passengers
already shaken by the recent IRA terror campaign at Heathrow airport.
At the heart of the conflict are US demands for greater access immediately
for its airlines into Heathrow airport, which under a 1991 agreement, can
only be served by American and United. The US has also sought to link the BA
code-sharing rights with USAir, the sixth largest US carrier, with the
broader renegotiation of the bilateral aviation agreement between the two
countries.
The UK has proposed a gradual three-stage process of liberalising
transatlantic air services and has insisted that the US must honour its
obligations under the 1991 agreement granting UK carriers code-sharing
rights in the US.
The US, however, refused to discuss the British three-stage proposal and
cancelled negotiations in January. The UK side has since attempted to revive
the negotiations, but the US has continued to refuse to hold formal talks to
try to resolve the deadlock. Both American Airlines and Delta urged their
government last week to renounce the current bilateral agreement and
withdraw BA's code-sharing rights, arguing that the UK carrier was now able
to tap the huge US domestic aviation market without comparable benefits for
US carriers in the UK.
The issue has been further complicated by BA's decision last week to suspend
additional investment in USAir because of the parlous financial state of its
US airline partner in which it has already invested Dollars 400m (Pounds
268m) for a 24 per cent stake.
The British government has since said it would have to review its position
on a new 'open skies' deal with the US given US approval of BA's future
investments in USAir have been a central part of the liberalisation talks.
But the UK transport authorities said this week that they wanted talks to
continue and that the UK was 'not walking away' from the process.
In Washington yesterday, the code-sharing pact was to be discussed by the
National Economic Council and possibly the National Security Council in the
White House. Congressional sentiment has been divided. With the
administration, already under international fire for its Japan and China
trade policies, not many expect Washington to provoke a trade war with one
of its closest allies.
The stakes are big: nothing less than the future aviation relationship of
two countries linked by international air routes with the world's highest
volume of traffic (11.5m passengers last year).

FT  17 MAR 94 / World Trade News: China goes on offensive over MFN
</HEADLINE>

   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China yesterday warned that the cancellation of preferential trade access to
the US market would have devastating consequences for the Taiwanese and Hong
Kong economies.
Mr Qian Qichen, China's foreign minister, in a clear attempt to mobilise
regional concerns over Most Favoured Nation status to press Beijing's case,
said that Hong Kong and Taiwanese businessmen risked losing billions of
dollars in the event of a trade war.
'I think the US can bear such losses, so can China, but I don't think the
other regions and countries can,' Mr Qian said.
Huge quantities of Chinese exports were transshipped through Hong Kong to
the US, he said, while Taiwanese businessmen had invested vast sums in
mainland enterprises geared to the US market.
The World Bank estimates that 96 per cent of Chinese exports, principally
textiles and garments, benefit from a lower tariff regime in the US.
Mr Qian was speaking some 48 hours after Mr Warren Christopher, the US
secretary of state, left Beijing following acrimonious discussions on the
human rights issue.
Washington is seeking to link 'overall, significant improvement' in China's
human rights behaviour to the renewal of its Most Favoured Nation trading
status. China had greeted Mr Christopher's arrival by detaining more than a
dozen dissidents in preceding days.
Chinese officials have warned that cancellation of MFN would cripple access
for US business to China. Two-way trade exceeded Dollars 40bn (Pounds
27.3bn) last year, heavily in China's favour. But American companies are
beginning to make a stronger showing.
Hong Kong would be most affected by a rupture over MFN. The HK government
estimates that projected economic growth this year of 5.5 per cent would
halve and perhaps as many as 75,000 jobs would be lost. Some Dollars 24bn
worth of trade would be jeopardised.
Mr Christopher sought to put the best face on what had been a fairly
disastrous visit, saying differences had 'narrowed'. But the Chinese
themselves were less sanguine.
'I am somewhat disappointed,' said Mr Qian. 'My talks with Christopher have
not produced as many results as previously expected.'

FT  17 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Tokyo accuses Washington of violating
accord

Tokyo has accused the US of violating an air accord by failing to approve a
scheduled Japanese airline flight to Hawaii just two days before it was
scheduled to go into operation.
The US informed Japan Air Lines it was deferring its decision on whether to
approve the flight from Sendai, in northeastern Japan, to Honolulu, pending
aviation negotiations between the two countries.
The move by the US, which came just two days before the flight was scheduled
to go into operation, is 'a clear violation of the bilateral agreement,' an
official at Japan's transport ministry said yesterday.
A 1989 memorandum of understanding between the US and Japan gives carriers
of both countries the right to fly from three regional points to
destinations in each other's country. 'JAL was merely exercising its
legitimate right,' the airline said.
Japanese transport ministry officials said the US move stemmed from
unhappiness with stalled negotiations over landing rights at Kansai
International Airport near Osaka which is scheduled to open later this year.
The US has demanded more landing slots at Kansai than Japan is prepared to
give, while Japan has been angered by US claims that the bilateral aviation
accord allows US carriers unrestricted onward flight rights from US
destinations to Japan and from there to a third country.
Japanese officials and airlines have claimed that US carriers were abusing
their onward flight rights and taking business away from Japanese carriers.
'We intend to tell the US that its move is in breach of international
rules,' a transport ministry official said yesterday. 'We find it curious
that the US has linked the issue to the aviation talks which have been
stalled since last August, largely as a result of US reluctance to carry on
with them,' the official said.

The strong US economic recovery is putting only mild upward pressure on
consumer price inflation, official figures indicated yesterday.
The Labour Department said the consumer price index rose 0.3 per cent and by
2.5 per cent in the year to February, in line with market expectations.
Separate figures showed that the housing industry is beginning to recover
after disruptions caused by severe winter storms. Housing starts rose 4.1
per cent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.31m. But
figures for January were revised down to show a fall of 22 per cent rather
than 17.6 per cent.
Bond prices rose modestly in early trading following release of the price
report. The core consumer price index  - which excludes the volatile
components of food and energy  - also rose 0.3 per cent last month and by
2.8 per cent in the year to February.
Earlier this week official figures showed little evidence of inflationary
pressures at the wholesale level. The producer price index for finished
goods rose 0.5 per cent but this reflected a surge in energy costs. Core
producer prices rose 0.1 per cent and by 0.4 per cent on an annual
comparison.
The consumer price report showed a continuing divergence in inflation trends
in goods and service industries. The index for services other than energy
rose 0.4 per cent last month and by 3.7 per cent in the year to February.
The core index for goods fell 0.1 per cent last month and rose only 0.8 on
an annual comparison.
The increase in housing starts was restricted to the north-east and south.
Starts fell in the midwest and the west. Most analysts expect a stronger
rebound in housing activity this month, despite a fall in building permits
in February, reflecting the low level of mortgage rates and a rise in
consumer confidence in recent months.

FT  17 MAR 94 / Fed cops patrol speeding US economy: The outlook for
interest rates in the light of soaring growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US economy is like a speeding juggernaut and the US Federal Reserve like
a traffic cop. Last month the Fed delivered a mild warning in the shape of a
quarter point increase in short-term interest rates to 3.25 per cent. When
Fed governors and regional presidents meet in Washington next week they may
decide sterner action will soon be required.
If the Fed was concerned by the pace of growth in early February, it ought
to be doubly concerned today. In recent weeks revised figures have shown the
economy grew at an annual rate of 7.5 per cent in the fourth quarter of last
year, rather than the 5.9 per cent at first reported. The jobless rate has
fallen faster than expected and, at 6.5 per cent, is only fractionally
higher than the level previously associated with rising wage inflation.
Adjusting for severe weather, economic data since January have been
uniformly stronger than expected. Sales and production of cars and light
trucks are booming. Retail spending is robust despite a temporary dip in
construction activity: according to the Johnson Redbook survey, sales in
early March were running 14 per cent higher than last year. Industrial
production appears to be growing at an annual rate of 7-8 per cent this
quarter  - a slight acceleration from late last year. The rate of capacity
utilisation in manufacturing has jumped to 82.6 per cent, just short of the
83 per cent level seen as a trigger for price increases.
This week bond investors were relieved that rapid growth does not yet appear
to be putting much upward pressure on broad measures of inflation.
But the encouraging consumer and producer price figures do not alter the
interest rate outlook much because Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, has
signalled that the purpose of tightening policy is not to fight an inflation
threat today but rather to prevent inflation getting out of hand in 1995 and
1996.
Looking forward, the Fed will note that traditional leading indicators of
inflation are beginning to creep higher. These include commodity prices
(other than oil), the price indices compiled by purchasing managers, and
various measures of capacity utilisation.
The Fed is also aware that the European and Japanese economies are starting
to show signs of improvement. The prospect of a concerted surge in demand in
1995 significantly strengthens the case for a pre-emptive tightening of US
monetary policy this year.
Analysts are divided over the likely timing and magnitude of increases in
short-term rates. At one extreme, JP Morgan, the New York bank, believes the
sharp rise in long bond yields in recent weeks to nearly 7 per cent is fully
justified. Morgan economists argue that the economy has lost little momentum
since the second half of last year when real gross domestic product grew at
an annual rate of more than 5 per cent.
They expect growth of more than 4 per cent this year and predict the Fed
will raise short rates to 5 per cent by the end of this year and 6 per cent
by the middle of next year.
This would not be out of line with previous business cycles. The average
increase in short rates in the last six episodes of Fed tightening was
nearly 5.7 percentage points. Excluding the inflationary 1970s, the increase
was 3.8 percentage points, which would suggest short rates could rise to
about 7 per cent in the next few years.
Other economists believe the recovery is less robust and predict the rate of
economic growth will decline in the second half of this year to 3 per cent
or less. They doubt the Fed will need to act as aggressively as in past
cycles in part because the risk of a big rise in inflation seems slight and
in part because the bond market is now hyper-sensitive to inflationary
pressures.
'The rise in bond yields is disciplining the real economy and helping the
Fed do its job,' says Mr Bill Dudley, a senior economist at Goldman Sachs.
The argument is that the surprisingly rapid steepening of the yield curve
will curb some of the most buoyant sectors  - such as housing and business
investment  - and hence reduce the required increase in short rates.
The timing of any rate increases is also hotly debated. Mr Greenspan has a
reputation for gradualism, which suggests he may be contemplating small
quarter point increases every few months.
But some analysts, such as Mr Neal Soss, chief economist at First Boston
Corporation, a New York brokerage, argue that such tactics would amount to
Chinese water torture.
Rather than creating a prolonged period of uncertainty, they say, the Fed
should rapidly raise rates to the 'neutral' level mentioned by Mr Greenspan
in recent congressional testimony. This is widely taken to imply rates of
4-5 per cent. With the agony over, bond and share markets might then be able
to recover their equilibrium, if not last year's high spirits.

FT  17 MAR 94 / IMF slow to act on Brazil loan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAO PAULO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The International Monetary Fund yesterday welcomed Brazil's economic reform
efforts, but fell short of promising a stand-by loan to back the
government's anti-inflation programme.
This left unclear the status of the country's commercial bank debt
restructuring, which needs an IMF seal of approval and is close to a
deadline.
Mr Michel Camdessus, managing director of the IMF, said there was already a
'significant record of progress' in tackling Brazil's annual inflation of
about 2,500 per cent under Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, finance minister.
He said Mr Cardoso's plans to introduce a new currency later this year
should lead to a 'sharp reduction' in inflation. The IMF has proposed a
monitored economic programme to be followed, when the new currency is
introduced, by either a stand-by loan agreement or a 'form of enhanced
co-operation'. He said work was continuing on the Brazilian programme for
'early consideration' by the IMF executive board.
Mr Camdessus made no committment on the signing or timing of a letter of
intent for the stand-by loan accord.
According to some analysts, such a letter is thought to be needed before the
US Treasury agrees to issue zero coupon bonds. These will form part of the
guarantee for the Brady-style rescheduling of Brazil's Dollars 52bn (Pounds
35.60bn) of private commerical bank debt.
Under the existing timetable, the bank deal has to be finalised by April 15.
Bankers and Brazilian officials had hoped the IMF would indicate support for
the deal this week. Delaying the April deadline is possible but difficult.
Mr Cardoso said he thought the IMF's statement, which listed eight positive
aspects of the country's economic policy for this year, was enough to win
support from the US Treasury.
Mr Cardoso is today due to meet Mr William Rhodes, vice-chairman of
Citibank, the closing agent for the bank deal, to discuss the next moves.
Notification that the deal is to go ahead has to be given by Friday for the
April 15 deadline to be met.
Brazil may now try to use Mr Camdessus' statement as an intention of support
and go ahead with the debt rescheduling without the formal stand-by loan
agreement. This would require the banks granting a waiver this week, and
would also suggest Brazil has already bought at least some of the required
zero coupon bonds in the market.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Congressman Dan Rosten-kowski, one of the most powerful members of the US
House of Representatives, has won a fierce battle for the Democratic
nomination in his Chicago district, aided by a campaign visit from President
Bill Clinton last month.
It was as much a victory for the president, struggling to put the Whitewater
affair behind him, as for the chairman of the influential House ways and
means committee.
Mr Clinton took a gamble in supporting a congressman who has come under a
political cloud because of a continuing federal grand jury investigation of
his finances that recalled old Chicago-style politics based on perks and
patronage.
At ways and means Mr Rostenkowski has been a faithful ally of Mr Clinton,
overseeing the administration's most important initiatives.
He has been in Congress since 1958, but his seat was for the first time
thought to be at risk in the three-man nomination race. In the end he won
with 50 per cent of the vote.
Mr Rostenkowski acknowledged the president's role in the win. 'There was a
point, a pivotal moment in the campaign, when a very, very gutsy and
honourable and courageous man named Bill Clinton came to town,' he told his
supporters. 'I'm proud to be a soldier in the president's march for change.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The man at the centre of the Codelco futures scandal, Mr Juan Pablo Davila,
was yesterday due to testify before a judge appointed to investigate
potential criminal aspects of the case.
Mr Davila, who is accused of losing Codelco, Chile's state copper company,
more than Dollars 200m (Pounds 134m) in speculative metals trading in London
and New York, has spent the past five days in detention giving testimony to
the police department, who are investigating allegations of fraud against
him.
Mr Jose Benquis, the special judge appointed to the case by former president
Patricio Aylwin, said on Tuesday that 400 of the 8,000 futures operations
conducted by Mr Davila in 1993 were 'strange' and 'unusual'.
Mr Benquis, defending the five-day detention of Codelco's former chief
futures operator, said: 'He is being interrogated on many technical aspects
that have to be cleared up and about which he must give his own
explanations.'
Mr Davila was being treated as a 'human being as befits any other person'.
He had daily visits from his lawyer as well as a medical practitioner and
was in good health, Mr Benquis said.
The judge did not rule out the possible interrogation of other former
Codelco executives, eight of whom resigned after the losses became public.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Paraguayan peasants have staged the biggest demonstration in the capital
Asuncion since President Juan Carlos Wasmosy took office seven months ago.
The peasants demanded land reform and protested at low prices for cotton,
one of their staple products.
About 15,000-20,000 peasants crammed into one of the capital's main squares
in front of the Congress building on Tuesday, while their leader, Mr Alfonso
Cohene, met opposition leaders to demand the expropriation of unproductive
land. He also demanded government subsidies to offset the decline in cotton
prices.
The peasants were unable to petition President Wasmosy because he was on an
official visit to Brazil. No one was reported hurt in the protest, despite
police efforts to prevent protesters reaching Asuncion.
Last month police clashed several times with peasants in the interior of the
country after protesters blocked roads and occupied farmland owned by
wealthy landowners, including one property owned by a senior member of the
ruling Colorado party.
Over half of Paraguay's population of 4.5m lives in the countryside, often
in great poverty. Demands for land reform have always been an important
issue, although the 35-year regime of former President Alfredo Stroessner
crushed simmering opposition.

Mr Rostenkowski may have hurt the president inadvertently when, in a
television interview yesterday to discuss his victory, he said congressional
hearings on the Whitewater affair are 'inevitable'.
The affair concerns Mr and Mrs Clinton's financial dealings in Arkansas in
the 1980s.
Whitewater was the name of an Arkansas development in which the Clintons
invested along with their friends Mr James McDougal, head of the Madison
Guaranty savings and loan institution, and his wife. Madison failed at a
cost to the taxpayer of Dollars 47m (Pounds 32.1m).
Democrats have been fighting off Republican demands for congressional
hearings, which would give the opposition more scope to equate the affair
with the Watergate scandal.

FT  17 MAR 94 / PLO urged to resume peace talks

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Israel and the US yesterday urged the Palestine Liberation Organisation and
Syria to resume Middle East peace talks suspended since last month's
massacre of Palestinians in the occupied West Bank town of Hebron.
Israel's Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin said after talks with US President
Bill Clinton in Washington he was dismayed by the murders, but security for
Jews needed attention as much as security for Palestinians. 'Security is a
two-way street,' he declared.
Israel remained ready to achieve peace with Syria. 'This has always been our
strategic choice. We will stand ready to do what is required, if the Syrians
are ready to do what is required of them,' Mr Rabin said at a joint news
conference with Mr Clinton.
Asked about the suggestion that PLO police be allowed to operate in Hebron,
Mr Rabin said security forces must be under a single chain of command. The
government in the West Bank was the Israeli military government. Urging PLO
chairman Yassir Arafat to end his boycott of talks, Mr Rabin added: 'We do
not seek to rule them any more.'
Mr Clinton said it was vital enemies of peace should not triumph. 'That is
why I have called on the prime minister and Chairman Arafat to find a way to
resume negotiations and to do so quickly.' Mr Rabin said he had told
President Bill Clinton Israel and the Palestinians were 'near the finish
line' of the initial phase of their talks. 'Some problems have yet to be
solved (but) I'm sure we shall find the right solution once talks are
renewed.'

FT  17 MAR 94 / Cambodia war goes on as UN winds up: Victor Mallet sees the
army prepare for dry season offensive on Khmer Rouge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Half way between the Cambodian capital, Phnom Penh, and the town of
Battambang, workers paid by the United Nations are filling in the road's
cavernous potholes and resurfacing it with tar and gravel; a little further
on, three government tanks on the way to the battle front are ripping up the
new surface with their tracks.
Half way between Battambang and the Thai border, hundreds of Cambodians paid
by foreign aid and commanded by ex-British army Ghurkas are painstakingly
clearing old minefields to make the land safe for farmers; a little further
on, government troops and Khmer Rouge guerrillas are laying new mines as
they prepare to fight.
The two-year, Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.3bn) UN operation to bring peace and
democracy to Cambodia is being wound up, but the war is not yet over. The
coalition government of royalists and communists elected under UN auspices
last May is poised for a dry season offensive to seize Pailin, the
gem-mining town on the Thai border that is regarded as the main stronghold
of the Khmer Rouge.
Truckloads of troops, along with tanks, artillery pieces and multiple
rocket-launchers known as Stalin organs, can be seen on the move towards
Pailin. So many government soldiers  - 7,000 according to some estimates  -
have been deployed at the front that residents of Battambang fear they will
be without protection should Khmer Rouge guerrillas decide to attack the
town.
The government offensive was supposed to begin a week ago but was delayed,
probably because it would have clashed with an international donors'
conference in Tokyo which raised Dollars 773m for Cambodia last week, and
because the army was shaken by a humiliating defeat at Anlong Veng in
northern Cambodia.
Government forces captured Anlong Veng from the Khmer Rouge in early
February after suffering heavy casualties caused by mines and booby traps,
but lost it three weeks later and retreated in chaos, short of water and
ammunition, when the guerrillas counter-attacked.
The Khmer Rouge, which flouted a 1991 peace agreement by refusing to disarm
its guerrillas or participate in the election, is nevertheless in decline.
Guerrilla numbers have fallen to below 10,000 from as many as 25,000 in
1991, according to diplomats in Phnom Penh, and some Khmer Rouge officers
have defected to the government since the election.
A successful, three-week government offensive last year drove the Khmer
Rouge out of the territory it had taken in the previous 18 months, while the
increasing trade in logs, gems and other goods across the border with
Thailand is opening up the previously remote areas where the Khmer Rouge is
strongest.
It is becoming harder to make any ideological distinctions between the two
sides in the war as they fight  - or negotiate  - over lucrative trade
routes. Army officers planning the assault on Pailin talk openly about their
deals in logs or gems with their Khmer Rouge 'enemies', and important
logging roads in some areas of Cambodia have remained curiously free of
mines  - the result, it seems, of secret trade agreements between the
combatants.
Cambodia remains a lawless country. When buses or cars are attacked and
robbed by armed men on the Phnom Penh-Battambang road, it is often unclear
whether the assailants are Khmer Rouge guerrillas, unpaid government
soldiers or bandits.
A grenade planted under fuel tanks at a Battambang petrol station last week
was attributed by some residents to Khmer Rouge saboteurs; others blamed the
owners of rival petrol stations. The device was exploded harmlessly by a
British ordnance expert.
An army victory in the assault on Pailin would boost the government's
morale, would deprive the Khmer Rouge of border trade revenue and could push
the guerrillas one step closer to formal peace negotiations. But the
organisation's leaders are probably already in hiding in the hills north or
south of the town, and few Cambodians or foreign observers believe the
capture of Pailin would immediately end the war.
Residents of Battambang, accustomed to the depredations of drunken soldiers,
are bracing themselves for the aftermath of the offensive and the return of
the troops. 'It's going to be an unpleasant town whether they win or lose,'
said one foreign aid worker.

FT  17 MAR 94 / North Korean nuclear deal on verge of collapse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
A deal to resolve suspicions about North Korea's nuclear programme appeared
to be on the verge of collapse yesterday after the International Atomic
Energy Agency confirmed its inspectors had been unable to carry out some
checks on one of its nuclear sites.
'Important measures agreed to in writing before the team went (to North
Korea) were refused,' an agency spokesman said. This was particularly the
case at the Yongbyon radiochemical laboratory. 'As a result the agency was
not in a position to verify there had been no diversion of nuclear material
at the facility.'
The IAEA will hold a special meeting of board member states on Monday to
decide on a response to obstructions.
The spokesman added that six experts of the IAEA team just back in Vienna
after a two-week visit to North Korea had been unable to take some samples
and measurements, and that there were 'problems' with seals placed on IAEA
monitoring equipment.
Mr Hans Blix, IAEA director-general, yesterday briefed representatives of 50
member states, though details of the briefings were not made public.
The US had promised to cancel this year's Team Spirit military exercise in
South Korea and hold a new round of high-level talks with North Korea on
possible diplomatic recognition if Pyongyang allowed unrestricted IAEA
inspections and exchanged envoys with Seoul.
The US State Department said last night that the meeting was unlikely to go
ahead next Monday because of the restrictions placed on the IAEA inspectors.
North Korea's refusal to carry out the terms of its agreement with the US
might be part of its negotiating strategy to gain 'leverage' to win new
concessions from the US and guarantee that Washington fulfilled its end of
the deal, a Foreign Ministry official said in Seoul.
On Tuesday, North Korea complained the US 'had raised unreasonable
preconditions' for suspension of Team Spirit, adding it would stop
negotiations with Washington unless the demands were dropped.
By raising new objections itself, Pyongyang may be seeking the repetition of
a deal concluded with the US in January 1992 under which Washington
suspended that year's Team Spirit in return for North Korea accepting
regular IAEA inspections, according to analysts in Seoul. Progress in
nuclear talks between North and South Korea was not included as a condition
in that earlier agreement.
North Korea was also balking at an exchange of envoys, who would discuss the
implementation of a 1991 bilateral non-nuclear pact, in an attempt to create
differences between Seoul and Washington and break their close co-ordination
on the nuclear issue, South Korean diplomats said.
Pyongyang also wanted to minimise the status of South Korea, which it has
accused of being a client state of the US, they added. Resumption of Team
Spirit in March 1993 angered the North, which then blocked the IAEA from
examining its nuclear sites until this month.
The North also threatened to withdraw from the nuclear non-proliferation
treaty a year ago in response to the IAEA's demand to examine two undeclared
sites, suspected to be nuclear waste dumps. The IAEA believes inspection of
the waste could determine if the North has processed more plutonium than it
has declared.
The North has repeatedly said it will not allow inspection of these two
sites, which were not included in the recent IAEA visit.

FT  17 MAR 94 / Scandals hit Japan budget debate
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Japanese government and opposition were yesterday paralysed by separate
scandals, threatening to delay market-opening measures urgently needed to
defuse the trade row with Washington.
Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, former prime minister and a faction leader in the
opposition Liberal Democratic party, yesterday denied press allegations he
was involved in efforts to prevent the Fair Trade Commission taking action
against a construction industry cartel.
The allegation, in the Asahi Shimbun, a daily newspaper with a long record
of uncovering LDP corruption, has reinforced the opposition's determination
to fight back by making use of a separate year-old scandal, to put pressure
on Premier Morihiro Hosokawa.
The LDP is boycotting a parliamentary debate on next year's budget until Mr
Hosokawa submits documents proving he repaid a loan from the Sagawa Kyubin
trucking company. It also wants Mr Hosokawa's secretary to give evidence in
the chamber.
Opposition officials said yesterday the budget boycott, started three days
ago, would continue.
Mr Hosokawa, who has repeatedly denied impropriety, continued to hold firm.
The budget debate 'shows no signs of resuming. The government takes the
situation seriously,' said Mr Masayoshi Takemura, chief cabinet secretary.
Continued blockage on the budget for the year starting April 1 jeopardises
the government's tax cuts, the main point of its second economic stimulation
in six months, designed to pull Japan out of its worst recession in post-war
years.
The wrangle delays work on draft plans to stimulate imports, as the
government decides whether or not to impose trade sanctions under the
recently revived Super 301 provision of US trade law. It wants the plans to
include further deregulation, incentives for foreign investment, tougher
controls against cartels, and more open public procurement.
It is also working on wider economic measures, to be ready for the Group of
Seven summit in Naples in July.
Sales at Tokyo department stores fell 6.1 per cent last month, from February
1993, marking the 24th consecutive monthly decline. Consumer spending is
sluggish, but department stores are doing especially badly, because they are
losing market share to new discount outlets, which report strong turnover.

FT  17 MAR 94 / Donors back environment fund accord
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS

<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Three days of negotiations in Geneva on setting up a Dollars 2bn (Pounds
1.34bn) Global Environment Facility to fund projects in developing countries
were nearing a successful conclusion last night.
The GEF's grant aid will enable third world and former communist countries
to help combat global environmental problems such as climate change, loss of
biodiversity, pollution of international waters, and ozone depletion.
Mr Mohamed el-Ashry, chairman of the fund which has operated on a pilot
basis since 1991, said lingering disagreements over procedure had been
resolved following 'solid indications' from donor nations that the full
Dollars 2bn would be forthcoming.
Donors were due to make formal pledges, but by far the biggest contributors
will be the US, Japan and Germany. The US is expected to pledge about
Dollars 430m, Japan about Dollars 410m and Germany about Dollars 395m for
the three-year replenishment, to run from mid-year.
This week's deal increases the likelihood that the fund, jointly managed by
the World Bank, UN Environment Programme and UN Development Programme, will
be the chosen permanent financial mechanism to fund projects under the
international conventions on climate change and biodiversity. The GEF is
already named in the conventions as the interim funding body.
The procedural issues reflected a North-South clash on who should control
the GEF, which has 87 participants. Developing countries wanted the fund run
along UN lines, with an elected chairman, and each country having equal
weight in decision-making. Donors wanted voting weighted by financial
contributions, as practised by the IMF and World Bank.
The outcome is a curious hybrid. Voting, in the absence of consensus, will
require a 60 per cent majority of countries, and approval by donor countries
representing at least 60 per cent of contributions. This gives both donors
and recipients a veto and as Mr El-Ashry observed, should be an incentive to
reach consensus.
The governing council will be chaired jointly by the GEF's chief executive
and an elected chairman. Sixteen of its 32 seats will go to developing
countries, 14 to industrialised nations and two to former communist
countries.

FT  17 MAR 94 / Australia puts on 4% growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Australian economy grew 4 per cent in 1993, the strongest annual growth
seen for five years.
According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, gross domestic product
grew 1.7 per cent in seasonally-adjusted terms during the final three months
of the year, pushing the rate for the 12 months to end-December to 4 per
cent.
Market forecasts ahead of the data's publication had been bullish, and the
result for the final quarter was at the lower end of predictions. Some
analysts, for example, had suggested an advance of 2 per cent-plus could be
recorded in the final period.
Australia now has the third highest annual growth rate in the Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and Development, behind Turkey, where growth is
running above 7 per cent, and New Zealand, with 4.2 per cent.
The latest figures mean the government will again revise its official growth
target during the 1993-94 fiscal year in the May 10 budget. 'In the light of
these figures, we will be revising our estimate up again,' Mr Ralph Willis,
the treasurer, said yesterday. 'What precisely that number will be, will be
revealed in the budget.'
Mr Willis had said he expected growth in the 12 months to end-June 1994 to
be about 3.5 per cent. The government's original forecast, made in the
budget last August, was 2.75 per cent.
Yesterday, the treasurer also confirmed that growth in the next fiscal year,
1994-95, was likely to exceed 4 per cent.
Australia's strong growth in the latter half of 1993 was driven by private
consumption, which rose 1.8 per cent in the final quarter, and 3.2 per cent
for the year, and by exports, which rose by 2.7 per cent and 6.6 per cent
for the same respective periods.
However, business investment was flat in the final quarter and showed a 12.5
per cent decline over the year. This was immediately attacked by Mr
Alexander Downer, opposition spokesman on economic issues. 'It is a matter
of great concern that business investment remains flat. . . If recovery is
to be sustainable, business investment must pick up strongly and underpin
economic growth.'
Prime Minister Paul Keating used the business investment figures as an
opportunity to sound a reassuring note on interest rates. There was 'a way
to go' before business investment picked up, he declared. 'We're not about
to choke that off with any misplaced sort of caution.'
Speculation has been rife recently that Australian interest rates might have
to rise, although Mr Willis has played down the possibility, at least in the
short term.

FT  17 MAR 94 / China takes one step back on prices: But new curbs do not
mean the end of steps forward
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chinese officials may not have hit the panic button over inflation, but
measures adopted this week to slow price increases reveal a deepening
concern.
Mr Zhu Rongji, China's vice-premier in charge of the economy, spoke of the
dangers of a 'domino effect' of price rises that might threaten the
government's entire economic reform programme.
Western economists in Beijing see the steps taken to control prices of some
20 items, including basic commodities and services, as recognition that
measures such as curbs in money supply growth and credit restrictions were
not enough to deal with an inflationary spiral.
But equally they do not view the new steps as an abandonment of the
government's liberalisation programme under which prices of about 90 per
cent of consumer items and basic commodities in the market have been
de-regulated.
'They must realise,' said a World Bank economist, 'that price control never
succeeds in the end.' For the moment, however, because of the disorderly
state of China's markets during its economic transformation, economists
believe intervention is justified.
'The national unified, open, orderly and competitive market system has yet
to shape up,' wrote an official of the State Planning Commission in an
internal memo recently. 'Market infrastructure lags behind . . . . Monopoly,
cheating, unbridled pushing up prices and unauthorised levying of
administrative charges (are all contributing to inflation)'.
Officials have been under enormous pressure on prices. Painful reforms of
state enterprises - a number are simply being allowed to wither on the vine
 -are causing hardship for thousands of workers who have lost jobs or are
working part-time on reduced wages.
Mr Zhu, in an unusually candid address to delegates at the current session
of the National People's Congress, blamed price rises mainly on speculation.
He also warned that wages have 'spun out of control'.
The cost of living (COL) in China's 35 main urban centres rose by 23.3 per
cent in January compared with the same period last year, and inflationary
pressures, especially in the potentially volatile cities, show little sign
of easing.
More worrying perhaps for the government than the COL increase (the COL
index includes services whose costs have been rising sharply) were signs
that the retail price index was also rising fast.
The index, which is heavily weighted towards food and clothing, soared to 19
per cent in December 1993 compared with a year earlier. The average annual
increase in 1993 was 13 per cent, more than double that in 1992.
Western economists are predicting that retail prices will rise 15 per cent
for the first quarter this year, making the year's target of 10 per cent
virtually unattainable.
Mr Zhu also warned that unchecked price increases were making worse the
difficulties of faltering state enterprises which were in danger of being
'strangled' by the 'debt chain', the inability of struggling enterprises to
pay each other for raw materials or finished products. He appeared to
foreshadow a 'carrot and stick' approach to public sector indebtedness,
saying that while banks had set aside funds to write-off public sector
debts, a new bankruptcy law which comes into effect this year will be
applied rigorously to hopeless cases.
It is debatable, however, whether, given the political sensitivities
involved, that even the redoubtable Mr Zhu has the nerve to follow through
on this threat.
Among measures outlined by Mr Zhu to curb inflation and to calm the economy,
which grew by more than 13 per cent last year, were a further clamp on
capital construction; reforms of the grain supply system; a freeze on
fertiliser price increases; and controls on prices of basic items.
He also called for a halt to the phasing out of subsidies to public
utilities such as gas and electricity.
Mr Zhu singled out vegetable prices as the key to damping down inflation,
and blamed the property boom for cutting into arable land near the cities.
Western economists also point out that a shortage of vegetable retail
outlets in the larger cities has led to disorderly pricing. There was, for
example, a 50 per cent difference between wholesale and retail prices in
many cases.
A World Bank official says that China is still paying the price in terms of
'cost-push' inflation for the construction binge of early last year that saw
increases of between 50 and 70 per cent in the prices of raw materials such
as cement and steel.
The bad news for Mr Zhu and long-suffering Chinese consumers is that
inflationary pressures are likely to persist through the middle of the year.
The slightly better news is that some economists are forecasting an easing
of these pressures in the second half.

surgeons, is objecting to proposals to sack doctors who are not selected by
at least 1,000 patients.

The European Commission approved the acquisition by Unilever, the
international food group, of the European frozen food group Safral, whose
subsidiaries are active in the French, German and Belgium ice-cream market.
The merger is expected to give Unilever almost 50 per cent of the ice-cream
market in France. This would not constitute a monopoly, the Commission said,
since the market was already competitive and fragmented, split between the
restaurant and street trade, and scoop and 'instant whip' ice-creams. 'The
characteristics of the market do not lend themselves to the creation of an
interdependent oligopoly,' the Commission said. Separately, the Commission
said it would examine whether FFr667.5m (Pounds 76.5m) in loans and
subsidies to Cellulose du Rhone et de l'Aquitaine, a French paper pulp
manufacturer, were illegal state aid.

The French parliament declined to lift the immunity of Mr Michel Noir, mayor
of Lyons, under investigation on suspicion of diverting city funds to
finance his election campaign. A Lyons judge had asked parliament to lift Mr
Noir's immunity so that he could be placed under judicial control, which
could involve restricting his movements, barring him from contact with other
persons in the case and possibly making him pay bail. Mr Philippe Seguin,
president of the National Assembly, said the assembly's standing committee
had ruled that, under the constitution, parliament's authorisation was
required only if a member was to be arrested. 'The request said that the
committee's authorisation was sought only for the measures involved in
judicial control,' Mr Seguin said. Only if Mr Noir violated bail terms set
by the judge and was subject to arrest would the assembly's permission be
required, he added.

Italy's first insider trading case is set to start today when Mr Luigi
Busiello, a financial products sales manager, goes on trial in Rome. The
case has been brought under a law implemented three years ago. Mr Busiello,
an employee of the Fideuram sales network controlled by IMI, is alleged to
have traded in the shares of Banca Manusardi in 1991 in the knowledge that
Fideuram and Banca Manusardi were shortly to merge.
He is alleged to have invested about L170m (Pounds 68,880) and made a profit
of a few million lire. Mr Busiello faces a maximum penalty of a year's
imprisonment and a L300m fine which could be tripled at the judge's
discretion. The Consob stock market watchdog, which sees the insider trading
law as part of reforms to increase investor confidence, has also pursued
investigations against a second defendant who goes on trial in Milan in
April.

<TEXT>
Denmark's Supreme Court yesterday ordered the government to repay a company
DKr800,000 (Pounds 80,000) in taxes ruled illegal by the European Court, but
it failed to set a clear precedent for other companies on DKr55bn levied in
total in illegal taxes between 1988 and 1991. The court ruled that Bose
Danmark, the subsidiary of an American loudspeaker company, should have the
tax repaid on the grounds that the tax caused the company a loss. But it
ruled against a second company, Denkavit, which sold milk substitutes to
farms, because the company proved no loss.
The tax, known as the labour market contribution, was a special 2.6 per cent
addition to value added tax and replaced a wage bill tax. The effect was to
benefit exporting companies (VAT is not paid on exports) and to penalise
importers and companies with mainly domestic sales. The European Court ruled
last year the tax was illegal because it was discriminatory. Mr Ole Stavad,
minister for taxation, welcomed the ruling, but said that it was unclear how
much money the government might have to repay.

FT  17 MAR 94 / Spanish Socialists seeking inspiration: The party's
conference in Madrid will concentrate on renovating a jaded image
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The slogan for the Spanish Socialist Workers' party conference starting in
Madrid tomorrow - 'Socialism's new impetus' - is indicative of nothing
except that, after more than 11 years in power, the party is running out of
slogans.
Nine months ago the Socialists rather surprised themselves by winning a
fourth consecutive term - although without an absolute majority and now
uncomfortably dependent on parliamentary support from Catalan nationalists.
This time there will be no triumphalism at the conference, the party's first
since 1990 and the most difficult that Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the prime
minister, has faced since he first swept into office.
The party needs to patch together a semblance of unity before preparing its
campaign for European elections in June and a regional poll in Mr Gonzalez's
home territory of Andalucia at the same time. Its image is jaded, having
lost a large part of the urban and young vote to the conservative Popular
party.
Searching for the first glimmers of economic recovery after the recession of
1993, Mr Gonzalez wants to bring the party firmly into line behind
government policies for controlling the budget deficit and curbing welfare
abuses. The draft policy statement for the conference is clear about the
party's role: 'The party should support the government and be an instrument
for explaining its actions to society.'
Heated argument over the easing of Spain's notoriously restrictive labour
laws has abated, with reform legislation on its way through parliament,
undeterred by a one-day national protest strike seven weeks ago. The voice
of the Socialist-led General Workers' Union (UGT) has in any event been
muted by embarrassment over the collapse of a union-backed housing
co-operative.
Other ideological battles - notably over the welfare state and regional
policy - are likely to be eclipsed in the public eye by personal struggles
for influence in the party hierarchy. The big question is how much power
remains in the hands of Mr Alfonso Guerra, the long-standing party number
two, and his allies.
Mr Guerra was the shadow following Mr Gonzalez into office:
behind-the-scenes organiser, holder of the party reins, architect of
election victories. Mr Gonzalez was the engaging figurehead, the
communicator. Friends from student days, the two men have grown apart. They
are now like an estranged couple trying to keep up appearances.
Mr Guerra resigned as deputy prime minister three years ago over allegations
surrounding his younger brother who, with Mr Guerra's permission, used a
government office in Seville to run a business. Despite the affair, which
supporters see as victimisation, he has retained a following. His brand of
orthodoxy - although not the purist left wing of the party - continues to
have appeal, especially in backward areas such as Extremadura, in the
south-west.
To opponents he represents an outdated style of party discipline and
clannishness. No longer with a representative in the cabinet, the Guerra
faction has a limited power base among the regional party 'barons', about 30
per cent among the nearly 900 delegates due to attend the conference.
The dominant group among the delegates - mostly teachers, civil servants,
lawyers and economists - goes by the label renovadores or 'renewers'. Back
in 1974, near the end of the Franco era, when the young Mr Gonzalez became
party leader at a conference in the Paris suburb of Suresnes, the
renovadores were the new blood taking over from the exiled historicos. The
tag now refers broadly to advocates of an open party organisation and
free-market policies. But it covers a range of opinions. The only common
bond is opposition to Mr Guerra.
In previous conferences, Mr Guerra drew up the list of candidates for party
office. This time, for the first time, Mr Gonzalez is doing it himself. Mr
Guerra has threatened to stand down if the party executive is not
'balanced'. But there have been efforts over the last few days to achieve a
consensus between the different factions to avoid an open break. It is a
fairly safe prediction that the 52-year-old Mr Gonzalez will get his way.
The party is closely identified with him, and he now seems intent on
maintaining his hold for several more years.
Wooed, among others, by German Chancellor Helmut Kohl as a successor to Mr
Jacques Delors as president of the European Commission, Mr Gonzalez told Mr
Delors last month that Brussels was not in his plans.
For all its talk of 'renewal', the party has failed to renew itself by
promoting a new generation. And even in Mr Gonzalez's generation there is
nobody who could easily now fill his shoes, either in government or in
opposition.

FT  17 MAR 94 / Enlargement of EU strains Franco-German axis: Anxiety in
Paris over the future of the Union has led to criticism of 'heavy-handed'
tactics by Bonn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The close diplomatic and political ties between Paris and Bonn,
traditionally regarded as the principal motor of European integration, have
come under new strain because of French concerns at the whole process of
enlargement of the European Union, according to senior government officials.
Criticism of Germany's allegedly heavy-handed tactics in forcing the pace of
the enlargement negotiations in Brussels emerged in Bonn yesterday, causing
anger and alarm in the office of Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
'We are urgently trying to contain the damage,' one German official said
yesterday.
The French concerns over EU enlargement include a worry about the inclusion
of a strong free trade lobby with the new northern members, and fear that
community institutions will be made both weaker and more cumbersome with
rapid enlargement to eastern Europe.
Publication of a long and detailed critique of German foreign policy in the
prestigious Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, quoting French sources in the
German capital, has clearly come at an acutely embarrassing time for the
German chancellor, who has just launched a highly personalised campaign for
re-election.
Mr Kohl is basing his appeal to German voters, both in the forthcoming
European elections, and in the general election in October, on his record as
a staunch proponent of European integration, and the guarantor of good
relations with major powers like France, Britain, the US and Russia. Any
suggestion that his closest ally, France, is dissatisfied with the
relationship is seen by senior German officials as extremely unhelpful.
The article is the latest in a series of diplomatic upsets, including
uncertainty over whether the German leader should be invited to the 50th
anniversary celebrations of the D-Day landings in Normandy, and cancellation
of the Allied military parades planned to mark withdrawal of British, French
and American forces from Berlin.
According to well-placed officials, the article was based on an interview
with Mr Francois Scheer, the French ambassador in Bonn, by Mr Claus
Gennrich, the respected diplomatic correspondent of the German newspaper.
In it, he suggests that the Normandy and Berlin incidents were only minor
upsets, but should be seen against the background of a general mistrust of
German foreign policy in Paris.
'A more fundamental dialogue is needed to create greater clarity between
Bonn and Paris over the definition of foreign policy in a united Germany,
but it is not taking place,' the newspaper said, citing the French sources.
The Frankfurter Allgemeine said the French were calling for German clarity
on its attitude towards eastern Europe, and the move of the seat of
government from Bonn to Berlin. They were seeking a 'clear restatement' of
Germany's commitment to western Europe, particularly if Bonn wished to
reinforce its relations with Russia.
The French officials are said to be worried by German statements from Mr
Klaus Kinkel, the foreign minister, suggesting that enlargement will 'shift
the balance' of the Community.
David Buchan adds from Paris: Mr Jean-Marie Girault, the mayor of Caen in
Normandy, yesterday weighed into the delicate diplomatic dilemma over
possible German presence at this summer's commemoration of the D-Day
landings by saying he hoped Mr Kohl would attend 'a peace ceremony' in his
city.
The Caen mayor, who is also a French senator, said he would invite the
German chancellor to a peace ceremony near the Caen war memorial on June 6.
'It is not easy to imagine Helmut Kohl on Omaha Beach where 3,000 American
soldiers died,' he said, 'but the ceremony on the evening of June 6 will try
to transcend military events and be an event for peace and reconciliation
among peoples,' Mr Girault said.
The French government has so far held back from inviting Mr Kohl to any part
of the 50th anniversary of the D-Day landings,but an opinion poll this week
showed that 57 per cent of French believed that Germany should be presented
at the Normandy celebrations.

FT  17 MAR 94 / Journalist questioned on Berlusconi scandal leak
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM

<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Fresh controversy has blown up over illicit payments on football player
transfers allegedly made by the Fininvest group, owned by Italy's aspiring
politician Mr Silvio Berlusconi.
The row has been simmering since last Wednesday when Tv5, one of Fininvest's
three national television channels, announced that Milan magistrates had
sought authorisation to arrest six senior Fininvest executives. The arrests
were allegedly connected to the payment of undeclared sums on the transfer
to cup-winning AC Milan of Turin's prize player 'Gigi' Lentini in 1992.
Milan magistrates immediately claimed the news had been deliberately leaked
and took possession of a copy of the Tv5 video of the announcement. They
suspected the news was made public to avoid high profile arrests of persons
linked to Mr Berlusconi at a sensitive moment in the campaign for the March
27 general elections.
Yesterday, the magistrates interrogated a Tv5 journalist about the leak, a
day after a Milan judge declined a request for the arrest of the six
Fininvest officials. It was later announced that the journalist was formally
under investigation for aiding and abetting.
The officials included Mr Marcello Dell'Utri, the head of Publitalia, the
advertising arm of Fininvest, and the organisational core around which Mr
Berlusconi's Forza Italia political movement has been built. Mr Dell'Utri is
part of Mr Berlusconi's inner circle and is widely credited with having
helped persuade Mr Berlusconi to enter the political ring.
Mr Berlusconi himself has claimed he and Fininvest are being persecuted by
the Milan magistrates in a political vendetta. However, yesterday the
magistrates let it be known they were continuing their investigations into
the transfer operations of AC Milan.
A former head of Turin football club has alleged that at least L6bn (Pounds
2.43m) was paid through foreign banks to secure the Lentini transfer  - on
top of the sum officially declared.

FT  17 MAR 94 / IMF chief steps into Russia's gathering economic storm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
These are hard times in Russia, and fears are growing that the country is
becoming ungovernable, or governable only with an iron hand.
Mr Michel Camdessus, managing director of the International Monetary Fund,
arrives in Moscow today for a five-day visit whose rarity testifies to the
urgency of the times. It is a crisis compounded of political drift, a
largely absent president and a swathe of problems untackled and festering:
at root, however, it is economic.
The credit squeeze of last year has worked. Inflation came down last month
to 10 per cent, half of January's figure. But industrial production was also
down, by 24 per cent against February 1993 as a result of the squeeze.
This may continue. Russian officials say Mr Victor Gerashchenko, the central
bank chairman, has massively undershot the credit targets recommended by the
government's Credit Committee, advancing only 40 per cent of the total
agreed. Though the motives of one who has always called for large credits in
order to prevent industrial collapse are unclear, the result is that the
squeeze is likely to continue.
The budget agreed by the government  - but not yet passed by parliament  -
is similarly tough. It proposes expenditure of around Rbs180,000bn, and an
income of Rbs120,000bn  - the deficit is as much as 10 per cent of gross
national product (on IMF calculations, more like 16-17 per cent).
But on these figures, say the main powers in the land, there is no way of
maintaining social order or production. General Pavel Grachev, the defence
minister, yesterday publicly complained that the Rbs37,000bn put by for the
military on the 1994 budget was less than half of what they needed. 'If the
situation does not change, there can be no talk not only about reforming the
army, but about providing for Russia's security as well.'
He estimated that if the sum were not increased, the arms ordered would have
to be cut back by one quarter  - decimating the already fragile military
industrial plants.
The energy, agricultural and regional leaders have not yet made their
demands public in this way  - but they will be of the same order. The
possibility of holding the line looks slim.
Yet on the income side, the picture is worse. Budgeted revenues of
Rbs120,000bn now look impossible to attain  - since government income is now
running at Rbs70,000bn-Rbs80,000bn a year and, in the words of one western
financial expert, 'there is no reason why it should get any better'.
This is the potentially horrifying situation into which Mr Camdessus steps
today. Russian officials say he is now under pressure from the Group of
Seven industrial countries to deliver aid: senior G7 officials say this is
not so, pointing to a discussion in Frankfurt last month at which it was
agreed that the Fund should make up its own mind and insist on the
observation of conventional criteria.
Certain it is that the managing director brings no panacea: however, he does
bring a slender lifeline of the second half  - Dollars 1.5bn  - of the
Dollars 3bn systemic transformation facility set up after last year's Tokyo
IMF summit to provide rapid loans to Russia, though he may not be able to
throw it if the government cannot convince him and his officials that the
budget is credible.
Mr Camdessus is deeply concerned with Russia  - the largest and most
intractable problem the Fund has to deal with. But while IMF officials have
found their engagement with the Russian government earlier this year
wearing, they and other western finance officials have been impressed by the
seriousness of the Russian leadership's approach to reform. These people now
acknowledge that the prime minister, Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, conventionally
viewed as a conservative, energy-lobby man, has become a convert to tight
budgets.
This message was conveyed to Mr Camdessus, and to senior World Bank
officials, earlier this year by the Swedish financier and investor, Mr Peter
Castenfelt, whose company, Archipelago Enterprises,is actively involved in
the Russian market. After their meeting in Washington, Mr Camdessus was
invited to Moscow to see for himself.
Mr Castenfelt, named in February as an unpaid adviser to the Russian prime
minister on enterprise issues, said yesterday: 'I believe these people are
very tough and want to continue enterprise reform. They are faced with huge
problems, and this budget is murder for the companies - but I am sure they
will go to great lengths to stick to it.'
If they do so, they risk a great deal. The Russian power structure has at
its apex  - President Boris Yeltsin  - off at the Black Sea resort of Socchi
for a two-week recuperation from flu after two and a half months of
exceptionally low profile. Many in the parliament, including relatively
sympathetic figures such as Mr Grigory Yavlinsky, head of the Yabloko group,
point to the dichotomy between a president with exceptional powers in the
constitution and no apparent will to use them.
Calls for a firm hand have reappeared. A Yeltsin ally, Mr Vladimir Shumeiko,
chairman of parliament's upper house, has proposed a state of economic
emergency.
This is the deepest economic crisis Russia has yet faced: it will make the
next few months dangerous indeed.

FT  17 MAR 94 / Bundesbank urges local councils to curb spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Bundesbank has launched an attack on a root cause of inflation with a
demand that west German local authorities act to stem rising deficits and
local service charges by reducing their workforces, privatising more
services and preparing for several years of belt-tightening.
The central bank also warned the federal government to avoid loading extra
burdens on to city and local administrations by forcing them to provide
increasingly sophisticated services.
The calls came in the bank's latest monthly report, published yesterday,
which highlighted the extravagant spending policies that have turned the
local authorities' 1989 surplus of DM2bn into an estimated deficit of
DM10.5bn last year.
Growth in spending exceeded growth in revenues by an average 2 percentage
points annually in the three years to the end of 1992, and total local
authority debt rose 14 per cent to DM127bn (Pounds 49.4bn). Underscoring the
plight of urban authorities, the report showed Frankfurt, Germany's
financial capital, with debts approaching three times its annual tax
revenues.
The Bundesbank, which has in the past identified rising public service
charges among the most persistent sources of inflation, noted that spending
had slowed markedly last year.
Total revenues rose 5 per cent in the first nine months of 1993, compared
with an average of 7 per cent in the previous three years, while outgoings
increased 5.5 per cent, the report said.
Personnel costs, which account for 25 per cent of local authority
expenditure, rose around 3 per cent last year after soaring 26 per cent in
the previous three years. But social welfare costs had gone up a further 14
per cent after rising 32 per cent in the three years to the end of 1992.
The report noted that income from taxes last year hardly increased,
attributing the stagnation to corporation tax reforms and, indirectly, to
sharply rising unemployment and falling real incomes.
These factors are expected to continue depressing revenues for some time,
while authorities will have to find extra funds to pay for statutory
kindergarten places, new sewage treatment works demanded by European
legislation, and, starting next year, increased contributions to help
eastern Germany.
The report, which closed for publication before last week's effective real
pay freeze for public sector workers, made no mention of the deal's likely
benefits. However it noted pressure on budgets would be eased by new funding
methods for care of the elderly and infirm, and federal measures to stem the
flow of refugees and asylum seekers whose housing and welfare has in the
past largely been the responsibility of local authorities.

FT  17 MAR 94 / Balladur reforms anger unions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
France's big union federations will today mount a rare show of unity in
demonstrating against the Balladur government's new law permitting young
apprentices to be paid less than the minimum wage.
Individual union federations and students unions have held repeated protests
at the contrat d'insertion professionelle (CIP), which passed relatively
unnoticed into law last autumn as part of the government's labour reforms
but provoked a union outcry when implementing decrees were published last
month. The communist-leaning CGT federation, for instance, demonstrated
alone last Saturday against the CIP, but is joining the three other main
union movements in today's action.
Mr Balladur has said he will not go beyond the concessions he made to unions
on March 3, when he promised that young people under 26 with diplomas would
not be paid less than the so-called Smic minimum wage (currently FFr5,600
(Pounds 641) a month), or less than 80 per cent of any sectoral wage
agreement. He also promised a tighter definition of the 'tutoring' of young
workers under the law.
But these concessions have not appeased the unions, with Mrs Nicole Notat,
head of the moderate CFDT union federation taking the line this week that
'it is not for the young to pay for their training'.
While repeatedly promising not to introduce a cut-price 'youth wage', Mr
Balladur clearly thought - at least until last month - that he had quietly
got away with doing just that in the guise of this CIP. In addition, the
pre-March 3 formulation of the law aroused concerns among the educated young
that their diplomas were being effectively devalued, since those with
university degrees could be paid as little as those without paper
qualifications. At the same time, older workers are anxious lest the young
take their jobs.
In the circumstances, this Sunday's first round of departmental elections
threatens to become a national referendum on government policy. Departmental
by-elections over the past year have run strongly in favour of the governing
coalition, but with Mr Balladur's own poll standing in decline after rows
over education reforms and now labour reforms, this trend could well be
reversed.
The CIP issue may, in fact, be raising exaggerated fears and hopes in all
camps. Taking a formally neutral stance on the issue, the Patronat
employers' federation has leading members who question the CIP's value as a
generator of jobs for those under 26 who represent a quarter of France's 3.3
unemployed. They would far prefer a rapid reduction in interest rates or a
speedy switch in welfare costs from company payrolls to the budget. But Mr
Balladur is now constitutionally committed to letting the Bank of France set
interest rates, and politically committed to reducing the budget deficit.
Mr Didier Maillard, Paribas' chief economist, yesterday commented that the
CIP measure was a step in the right direction, because 'structural
rigidities relating to wage costs for less-skilled, among them inevitably
many younger workers, are responsible for 8-9 percentage points' of the
jobless rate of 12.2 per cent.
He pointed to the fact that since the Smic was created in 1970, successive
governments have increased its level by 98 per cent, while under a strict
application of the original 1970 formula it would only have risen by 32 per
cent.

FT  17 MAR 94 / Rail union calls strike vote over sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The RMT rail union is calling a strike ballot of its 55,000 British Rail
members over their terms of employment after privatisation.
The union wants a series of 24-hour stoppages to force BR to continue
agreements that protect workers from redundancy.
'Job security features high on the list of fears for the future our members
have,' Mr Jimmy Knapp, RMT general secretary, says in a letter circulated
yesterday to union branch secretaries.
The union is concerned to protect members' existing terms on job promotion,
transfer and redundancy after privatisation, which begins next month.
'From day one,' Mr Knapp says of privatisation in his letter, 'we have known
we can expect attack after attack on members' conditions of service.'
Ballot papers calling on RMT members to back a series of 24-hour strikes on
the rail network are to go out on March 29.
Under collective agreements, BR workers have access to promotion or job
transfer between different parts of the company. That will no longer be
possible after April 1 when Railtrack, the new wholly state-owned
undertaking responsible for maintaining the track, comes into existence.
The RMT estimates that between 11,000 and 12,000 BR staff will then be
transferred to employment in Railtrack.
'All signal men and women, crossing keeps, some operational supervisors,
plus control and electrical staff and about 700 station (workers) will no
longer be part of BR,' Mr Knapp says.
'This means anyone in BR who has an eye on a job in any of these grades will
not be able to apply for one  - except as a new entrant.'
Demands for interchange arrangements to be continued after April 1 'have met
with a flat refusal from BR', Mr Knapp says, 'and therefore if we are to
pursue the existing rights . . . we will have to fight for them. We have
reached a stage where BR are saying they will no longer honour a major
agreement.'

FT  17 MAR 94 / Heron faces threat from 'significant' danger of default
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The threat of receivership is again hanging over Heron International, the
property and trading group run by Mr Gerald Ronson, only six months after it
completed a Pounds 1.4bn refinancing.
Heron yesterday warned bondholders that it was 'currently exposed to a
number of significant uncertainties' and there was 'a significant potential
for cross defaults' on its debt. It also warned that interest due to
bondholders might be delayed further.
Some creditors doubted last summer whether Heron's business plan was
achievable because it relied on a recovery in the European property market.
Although there has since been an upturn in the UK, Heron said yesterday a
collapse in the Spanish property market had raised the risk of its
defaulting.
The group said a review of all its properties was being undertaken, and
initially showed that Heron would not now be able to repay its senior debt
by its due date of March 1997. This debt would have to be renegotiated.
Spanish difficulties also contributed to a net loss of Pounds 63.4m in the
six months to September 30, by when the group's negative net worth had
worsened to Pounds 157.8m from an adjusted figure of Pounds 109m six months
earlier.
Heron's interim results, prepared on the assumption that it was able to
continue trading, included a provision of Pounds 13.3m for a further fall in
property values and a Pounds 30.5m foreign exchange loss.
The group has called meetings of its bondholders to seek approval of a
deferral of interest, due on March 31, to June 30 on top of delays in debt
repayments and fees. In total, Heron is seeking to defer payments of Pounds
52.1m.
But Heron said recent events possibly meant a further deferral of interest
beyond June 30.
It expects to receive Pounds 75m from disposals by the end of June  - Pounds
31m from the sale of Heron Homes and Pounds 44m from the sale of the Heron
Suzuki motor distributor to Suzuki Motor Corporation. Under Heron's complex
banking arrangements, it cannot use this cash to meet head office
obligations.
Mr Ronson, formerly also Heron's chairman and owner, had led an investor
group which planned to buy Heron Suzuki. Heron said yesterday Mr Ronson had
no financial interest in the transaction. He would remain non-executive
chairman of Heron Suzuki but receive no salary.

FT  17 MAR 94 / US and Moscow close to Balkan peace plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY and LAURA SILBER

   LONDON, BELGRADE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Washington and Moscow believe they are within days of reaching an overall
peace plan for former Yugoslavia.
Details of the proposed settlement emerged as the United Nations said it
planned to lift the nine-month Serb siege of Maglaj in central Bosnia,
preferably with Serb consent, but using a 'more muscular' approach if
necessary.
The complex US-Russian peace proposal involves Serbia recognising the
pre-war borders of Croatia and giving up some territory it gained in the war
in Croatia which ended in January 1992.
It also involves acceptance by Washington and Moscow that territory in
eastern Bosnia held by Bosnian Serbs will enter into a loose union with
Serbia proper. Underpinning this plan is an acceptance by Serbian president
Slobodan Milosevic that he make some concessions in return for the the west
gradually lifting sanctions against Serbia.
US State Department officials are preparing public opinion  - and the UN  -
for the phasing out of sanctions in an attempt to end the war in the
Balkans. The negotiated compromise would mean the US would no longer have to
send ground troops into Bosnia to oversee implementation of any peace plan.
Mr Stephen Oxman, US assistant secretary of state, said any moves to ease
sanctions would be linked to 'positive steps taken by the Serbs in the
negotiating process'. US officials said sanctions against Serbia would be
'phased out'.
Although both US and UN officials were reluctant to say when the sanctions
would begin to be lifted, they said a meeting in Croatia next week could tip
the balance in favour of peace.
Serbs from Krajina, the self-styled republic in south-western Croatia, will
meet Croatian officials at the Russian embassy in the Croatian capital
Zagreb. This is the first such meeting since Croatia broke away from the
Serb-dominated Yugoslav federation and declared independence in June 1991.
Mr Vitaly Churkin, Russia's special envoy to the region, met Mr Milan
Martic, leader of the Krajina Serbs, in Belgrade yesterday to explain the
goal of next week's meeting.
The Russian envoy said the agreement would end military and other
hostilities between Croats and Serbs in Croatia. But UN diplomats said it
would also involve Serbia making some territorial concessions.
Mr Martic still insists that the Krajina Serbs would never live in an
independent Croatia and that the region should be linked to Serbia proper
through corridors stretching across Serb-held territory in north and east
Bosnia.
However, Mr Milosevic, whose government once provided Krajina with a
military and economic lifeline, is increasingly inclined to break Belgrade's
links with Krajina and recognise Croatia's current borders, in return for
the lifting of sanctions.
Russia will insist that if Croatia wants control over Krajina, it must grant
extensive autonomy to the Serbs.
'There cannot be genuine peace in Bosnia-Hercegovina if tensions remain in
Krajina,' said Mr Churkin.
'We thought that while we keep working very hard on Bosnia-Hercegovina, we
should not forget the very thorny issue, very explosive issue' of Krajina,
he added.
The future status of Bosnia will also be discussed tomorrow in Washington
between Mr Churkin and Mr Charles Redman, the US special envoy to former
Yugoslavia.
Bosnia's Croats and Moslems are expected to sign a draft constitution for a
federation in part of Bosnia, and a 'general framework' for a confederation
with Croatia.
The Bosnian Serbs, who control about 70 per cent of Bosnia, remain reluctant
to join the federation.
Instead, UN diplomats said Washington and Moscow are likely to accept that
the Bosnian Serbs have a special relationship with Serbia as the price to be
paid for an overall peace settlement.
