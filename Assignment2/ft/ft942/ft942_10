FT  16 JUN 94 / EU transport ambitions depend on private cash
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Private sector finance will be needed to fund half the European Union's
ambitious plans for a trans-European network of transport links, a leading
specialist said yesterday.
Of the Ecu70bn (Pounds 540bn) needed for the ten most advanced transport
projects, Ecu35bn will have to be raised from private sources, according to
Mr Wolfgang Hager, director of the European Centre for Infrastructure
Studies, a think-tank.
Only Ecu23bn would come from taxes (including the Union budget), Ecu9bn from
the European Investment Bank, and Ecu3.5bn from the railway companies, he
told the Financial Times conference, Transport in Europe.
The ambitious scale of the EU's transport plans raised the danger of the
overall vision being lost and the project petering out before it had
properly begun, he warned.
Traditionally, transport plans had emerged from a slow technocratic process,
based on traffic forecasts, 'which relieve bottlenecks perfectly obvious to
everyone for decades', he said. The trans-European network programme, by
contrast, involved a far-reaching vision of the future.
The limited financial resources available to carry out the programme were in
stark contrast to the ambitious political and economic goals of the
programme, Mr Hager said.
It sought to achieve a physical integration of the internal European market,
to boost regional development, to support industrial policy and to
deregulate the supply of goods and services.
The programme might also run into problems because of the shift in spending
involved from roads to public transport, Mr Hager said.
Mr Jurgen Erdmenger, a director of the European transport
directorate-general, said that at present EU member states spent 66 per cent
of their Ecu50bn annual transport budgets on roads, 23 per cent went on
rail, 5.6 per cent on airports, 3.5 per cent on ports and 1.5 per cent on
canals.
The trans-European network programme envisaged spending a total of Ecu400bn
over the next 10-20 years, of which just 30 per cent would go on roads, 60
per cent on rail and 5 per cent on canals.

FT  16 JUN 94 / Five-year EU court battle is lost in the translation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A five-year court battle was lost in translation yesterday when the members
of an alleged plastics cartel had fines totalling Dollars 27.5m (Pounds
18.3m) dismissed because of a series of errors made by the European
Commission.
The European Court of Justice in Luxembourg overturned the fines against a
group of 14 PVC companies because of discrepancies between the German,
English and French texts of the Commission's decision on the cartel.
The textual differences invalidated the entire legal process, the court
said.
It ruled the Commission must pay legal costs for itself and the 14
companies. The Commission said it was too early to say how large the costs
might be.
A further problem was that Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, had
signed the original decision, taken in 1988, in only three of the five
relevant language versions. The process did not stand up in court, the court
said yesterday.
'Acts tainted by an irregularity whose gravity is so obvious that it cannot
be tolerated by the Community legal order must be treated as having no legal
effect,' said the judgment.
The Commission, still determined to impose the fines, hit back with a
decision to begin the process all over again.
In a statement it said it proposed to restart the action, 'correcting the
procedural errors'.
Although Mr Delors signed French, German and English versions of the
decision, it was delegated to Mr Peter Sutherland, then the competition
commissioner, to sign the Dutch and Italian versions.
The court said the papers should only have been signed by the Commission's
president and executive secretary.
'Far from being, as the commission claims, a mere formality for archival
purposes, the authentication of the acts is intended to guarantee legal
certainty by ensuring that the text . . . becomes fixed in the languages
which are binding,' a court statement said.
A Commission official said: 'These sorts of mistakes don't happen very
often.
'We have changed our procedures to make sure it doesn't occur again.'
There were no plans to sue any translators, he added, but one or two civil
servants may be ticked off.
The Commission works in nine different languages and it is not the first
time that linguistic misunderstanding has come between Europeans. Victor
Hugo, the French novelist, once translated the Firth of Forth, the Scottish
estuary, as 'Le premier du quatrieme'.

FT  16 JUN 94 / British Gas warns of no dividend increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Gas warned yesterday that a new price formula for gas transportation
charges would prevent from it increasing its dividend this year and could
force it to curtail its Pounds 900m a year pipeline investment programme.
The formula, a key step in the liberalising of the gas supply, was announced
by Ms Clare Spottiswoode, director-general of Ofgas, the industry regulator.
She is proposing that from next October British Gas be allowed to charge
14.16p per therm of gas that it transports through its pipeline. After that,
annual increases will be limited to the rate of inflation minus five
percentage points.
The proposal will have no immediate effect on gas prices paid by consumers,
which are covered by a separate pricing formula. Gas transportation charges
amount to half the cost of gas delivered to the home.
The formula will cover the transportation and storage arm which British Gas
is having to set up as a separate unit, following last year's inquiry by the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission. It will sell its services both to British
Gas and independent gas suppliers who are being allowed into the market over
the next three years. Mr Cedric Brown, British Gas chief executive, said the
formula was 'very tough and would leave us with an even more difficult task
to deliver an acceptable return to shareholders'.
'Taken together with regulatory pressures as a whole, it will be difficult
for the company to justify any increase in dividends for 1994,' he said.
British Gas shares fell sharply on the news, closing down 17p at 272p.
However, analysts said that Mr Brown's dividend warning had the greater
impact.
Mr Brown said British Gas was already being forced by the regulator to yield
market share to new suppliers and was incurring heavy costs in hiving off
the transportation network.
Ms Spottiswoode said she believed the formula struck a good balance between
the interests of British Gas's shareholders and those of gas consumers.
She said the formula would only give British Gas a rate of return at the
lower end of the 4-4.5 per cent range recommended by the MMC, but it allowed
a higher return on new investment, giving the company an incentive to invest
in the pipeline system.
The formula will run to March 1997, the deadline set for full competition in
gas supply.
Mr Philip Rogerson, British Gas's finance director, said the price controls
would make it hard to justify the Pounds 900m annual investment which the
company had budgeted for it. However, the formula was also attacked by
independent suppliers as too lenient. Mr Peter Bryant, vice-chairman of
United Gas, said: 'British Gas has got what it wanted.' British Gas would
still earn Pounds 3.3bn in annual revenues.

FT  16 JUN 94 / MacGregor admits he intervened in rail pay dispute: Train
drivers threaten to hold strike ballot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, KEVIN BROWN and STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John MacGregor, the trans-port secretary, admitted yesterday he had
intervened in the rail dispute to warn Railtrack management not to breach
the government's public sector pay bill freeze.
His admission, which came as the rail network was paralysed by the 24-hour
strike, followed the withdrawal earlier this week of a negotiating
'proposal' by Railtrack to pay its signalling staff a 5.7 per cent rise.
Further conflict on the railways was threatened yesterday by the train
drivers' union Aslef. Its annual conference threw out a 2.5 per cent pay
settlement recommended by its leaders. Delegates warned if it was not
increased the drivers would be balloted for strike action.
Until Mr MacGregor's remarks on the Railtrack proposal, the government had
repeatedly denied allegations that it put pressure on the company to drop
the higher offer.
Mr MacGregor said he had told Railtrack, the new public sector company
responsible for the railway infrastructure, of 'the general government
position' on public sector pay within the past few days.
Mr Frank Dobson, Labour's transport spokesman, said Mr MacGregor's comments
showed the rail strike was 'entirely the fault of the government'.
Although the rail network was at a virtual standstill yesterday, predicted
road chaos failed to materialise as thousands of commuters stayed at home.
Negotiations are expected during the next few days to try to prevent a
second 24-hour stoppage by railway signal staff announced for next
Wednesday.
Both Mr Bob Horton, Railtrack chairman, and Mr Jimmy Knapp, general
secretary of the RMT rail union, said they hoped talks could continue
despite further public argument over who was to blame for the dispute. Mr
Horton denied that signalling staff had been offered 5.7 per cent and he
repudiated a memorandum from his production manager for Railtrack South that
said it had. 'That was an internal memorandum from an over-zealous, very
junior manager,' he said.
The RMT union issued another Railtrack document, Proposal to RMT, handed to
the union last week by Mr Chris Leah, the company's main negotiator. It
makes clear that Railtrack wants 'to restore the relativities of signalling
grades as detailed in the RMT claim of February 9'. It adds: 'This figure
which is set at 5.7 per cent will then be cascaded throughout all the
signalling grades. This new basic rate will then be the base position for
stage two discussions.' The Railtrack 'proposal' emphasised that the
signalling staff would have to agree to work flexibly and open up jobs to
wider recruitment.
What seems to have happened is that Mr Horton and his board decided to
overrule Railtrack's negotiators by withdrawing the 5.7 per cent interim pay
offer. Instead they decided all the issues raised by the union should be
dealt with in one set of negotiations.

FT  16 JUN 94 / Clarke promises economy will not boom and bust: Future rise
in interest rates indicated by Bank governor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, PHILIP COGGAN and GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, last night pledged that the government
would not steer Britain's economic recovery into a new boom and bust cycle
by generating a 'fraudulent, inflationary, feel good' factor among the
electorate.
Delivering the annual Mansion House speech in the City, Mr Clarke moved
decisively to scotch suggestions that the government might opt for more
expansionary economic policies in the wake of recent electoral disasters.
After a day in which official figures pointed to a steady, low inflation
recovery from recession, he made clear that public spending cuts would take
precedence over tax cuts. He declared that it would be 'very bad politics'
for the government to risk more inflation.
'We will cut taxes again, but only when we can afford to do so,' Mr Clarke
said. 'The public are usually more sensible than politicians and the press.
They will not put their confidence in a government that cuts taxes before
getting borrowing under control.'
The Mansion House speech has traditionally been the occasion for chancellors
to expound on monetary policy. But last night, Mr Clarke chose a broader
brush approach, partly because the details of monetary policy are in the
public domain following the government's decision to publish the minutes of
the chancellor's meetings with Mr Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of
England.
It was left to Mr George to dwell briefly on monetary matters, with a clear
warning that UK interest rates would have to move upwards at some
unspecified moment in the future.
When rates were raised it would be 'to maintain the (economic) expansion at
a sustainable pace', Mr George said. The Bank's purpose was 'not to leave
the tightening of policy so late that the economy is brought to a juddering
halt by a much larger interest rise than would otherwise be needed'.
Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, later claimed the speeches showed Mr
George did not find Mr Clarke's policies 'credible'. He added that the
government could not be trusted now on taxes or interest rates.
Yesterday's figures on unemployment, inflation and earnings suggested the
economic recovery is being sustained. Average earnings slowed to an
underlying average annual rate of 3 3/4 per cent in April from 4 per cent in
March, calming City fears that the Bank might soon have to push up short
term interest rates.
The news on the retail prices front was also positive, with the annual
'headline' rate of inflation staying unchanged at 2.6 per cent in May
compared with April. Although the underlying measure of retail price
inflation quickened to 2.5 per cent last month from 2.3 per cent in April,
analysts said the increase partly reflected seasonal factors.
Meanwhile, a seasonally adjusted 20,100 drop in unemployment to 2.66m in May
reinforced the picture of a steady recovery. The fall, for the fourth month
in a row, cut the jobless rate among benefit claimants to 9.4 per cent of
the workforce in May from 9.5 per cent the month before.
There continued, however, to be a discrepancy between the claimant figures
and those for the workforce in employment. The latter showed that the number
of people in employment fell by 92,000 in 1994's first quarter.
Mr John Prescott, shadow employment secretary, said: 'The government's own
statistics show in 1993, while 201,000 people came off unemployment
benefits, employment increased by only 19,000. The rest disappeared.'

FT  15 JUN 94 / Survey of Telecommunications in Business (23): Ways to cut
call failure rates - Cordless Phones
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ever since the first telephone was demonstrated by Alexander Graham Bell in
1876, telephony has been associated with the office and workplace.
The traditional PABX (private automatic branch exchange) and the hard-wired
extension still plays a pivotal role in most offices but in recent years a
new breed of cordless telephone equipment has begun to appear.
Cordless telephones have been available for use in the home for more than a
decade. Generally these simple systems include a portable handset which
communicates by radio with a fixed base-station which is connected to the
public telephone system.
However, in recent years technical advances, particularly the switch from
analogue to digital radio transmission, has greatly increased the scope of
cordless systems enabling high-capacity systems, capable of serving hundreds
or even thousands of business users, to be built.
The advantages of cordless business systems are easy to appreciate. In
particular, workers are no longer tied to the desk where the hard-wired
telephone sits and incoming calls have a much better chance of reaching
their intended recipient.
Surveys have shown that up to two-thirds of all business calls fail to reach
their target, in about half these cases the person called is somewhere in
the building, but can not be found - European industry spends about Pounds
10m a year on on-site paging and PA systems in an attempt to alleviate the
problem.
Cordless systems can reduce the call failure rate substantially, improving
efficiency and customer satisfaction while cutting the cost of returned
calls.
Ericsson, the telecommunications equipment manufacturer, claims that
cordless business system customers can save up to 30 per cent of their bills
as a result.
In addition, cordless systems can save on running costs. Most organisations
running medium-sized or large PABX systems spend around 10 per cent of the
capital cosy of the system on rewiring and other reconfiguration operations.
Market analysts have predicted that these advantages will help cordless
business systems capture between 20 and 30 per cent of the market by the
turn of the century - equivalent to between 15m and 20m telephone
extensions. In Europe, alone it is estimated that the market could be worth
Dollars 15bn.
Systems manufacturers such as GPT Communications Systems, a joint venture
between Germany's Siemens group and Britain's GPT, tend to be more cautious
suggesting that cordless systems could take between 10 and 15 per cent of
the market by the year 2000.
Either way, there are several obstacles to overcome - in particular there
are two main competing cordless business system technologies, CT2 (Cordless
Telephony 2) and Dect (Digital European Cordless Telecommunications.)
CT2 was the first digital cordless technology to be developed in the UK
during the 1980s and has been adopted as an interim European standard. It is
the same technology used for Telepoint services in Europe and elsewhere.
GPT Communications Systems and Canada's Northern Telecom have been supplying
cordless office systems based upon CT2 digital technology - BT also supplies
re-badged Northern Telecom systems.
Northern Telecom, which is also developing a Dect system for up to
1,000-users in conjunction with Olivetti, launched its Companion CT2
cordless business systems in Europe in March last year and has sold over 900
systems in 13 European countries and the Middle East since then and over
2,000 systems worldwide.
'We believe that cordless will be a key differentiator in future PBX
markets,' said Mr Chris Wade, director of personal communications systems
for Northern Telecom Europe.
Among recent customers for the Companion system has been Boehringer
Ingelheim's French subsidiary. The pharmaceuticals group installed a
companion system at its Reims site which houses 350 employees in a dozen
buildings in December.
The system, which has replaced pagers and walkie-talkies for mobile
employees, has since been expanded and will cover 60 extensions by the end
of this year.
CT2's supporters claim it is a proven cost-effective technology ideally
suited to small and medium sized offices or sites. Mr David Wright,
International Marketing manager for GPT, claims that for most customers the
technology itself is irrelevant - 'the issue is: which is going to be
cheaper?' he says, and that will mostly depend on volumes.
For the moment, CT2 handsets cost around a third of the price of their Dect
rivals. And Mr Wright believes CT2 will continue to have a price advantage,
in part because of the adoption of the technology outside Europe, for
example in the Far East.
Mr Wright says that perhaps surprisingly, customers so far for GPT's iSDX
100 cordless system in Britain have mainly been in the retail and
manufacturing sectors, rather than offices.
For example, one High Street retailer has installed cordless systems to
enable its managers to return to the shop floor, rather than be stuck in the
back office.
Meanwhile, Axis Holdings, a Liverpool-based manufacturer of extruded
polythene film and PVC profiles, has installed a cordless system to enable
staff to respond quickly to customers.
Systems based on the rival Dect standard, which is backed by ETSI (the
European Telecoms Standards Institute) and was designed to solve the problem
of providing cordless telephones in high-density business environments such
as offices, begun to appear last year.
The Dect standard has been adopted by five of Europe's largest
telecommunications equipment suppliers - Alcatel, Ericsson, Nokia, Philips
and Siemens - which between them represent nearly 70 per cent of the
European PABX market.
They argue that Dect systems have significant advantages over CT2,
particularly for heavy use within large office buildings or for mixed voice
and high speed data traffic.
Ericsson has been one of the most active promotors of Dect systems and
launched its Freeset system in Europe last autumn although it has been
selling similar systems outside Europe for some time.
The Freeset system works as an 'add-on' to a company's existing phone
network and comprises three main components: a radio exchange which connects
to the host PABX or key-system - or directly to the local telephone exchange
in the case of a company using a centrex service; a number of low-powered
radio base stations each of which can support up to 12 simultaneous calls,
and up to 600 cordless handsets.
For larger systems, a number of radio exchanges can be networked together.
Freeset systems have been installed in manufacturing factories, hospitals
and 'offices of the future' such as Digital Equipment's futuristic
headquarters in Stockholm.
A 160-extension Freeset system has been installed in Digital's 'Natural
Office' where staff do not have permanent working positions. The system will
be expanded to handle 600 extensions this year.

FT  15 JUN 94 / Survey of Telecommunications in Business (22): Electronic
Socrates takes a class - Monica Horten reviews developments in
video-conferencing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MONICA HORTEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A new technique in distance learning is being pioneered by Boston University
in the US. Working with United Technologies Corporation, it has set up the
'virtual university' at which some 150 distance learning students attend
live video tutorials. Tutor and students watch each other on a computer
screen, asking direct questions as they would in the classroom.
Classes are conducted by the tutors from an electronic speaker's podium,
named Socrates. The podium has an overhead slide projector in the normal
way, but also has a built-in computer screen. The screen displays the video
image of the students as well as computer data: charts, lecture notes, maps
or a whiteboard. To bring an individual student into view and conduct a
personal conversation, the tutor presses a set of controls underneath the
screen.
Socrates is a far cry from the office 'cinema-size' video conferencing units
of the mid-1980s. It reflects the dramatic advances in video conferencing
technology in the past year or so. The average system is small enough to be
moved around on a trolley - 'roll-about' system is the new industry term.
But the latest systems which will appear on the market this year will run on
a personal computer. People will be able to run the video conference as part
of their normal computer software.
The personal computer systems will be sold as a card which slots inside the
PC unit - although some manufacturers are working with video conferencing
suppliers to build the technology into their machines as a standard feature:
for example, Compaq, the pc-maker is working with Picturetel, which invented
Socrates.
PC systems have been anticipated for some time, but technical difficulties
have meant that they have overshot the manufacturer's original timetable for
shipment. There is still confusion as to which systems are or will be
available and when.
Heidi Aghnami of Dataquest, the industry analyst, believes that only
Picturetel and VTel now have products shipping in volume. But several are
scheduled for the next few months, including ICL, GPT, Northern Telecom, BT,
IBM and Olivetti.
PC systems will operate via the ISDN telephone services. ISDN is practical
because it is a dial-up service; and because it provides the necessary
bandwidth for video transmission for the same cost as an ordinary phone
call.
A video call needs a minimum of 128Kbits/s for the system and an acceptable
picture quality. Ideally it should have 384Kbits/s.
One ISDN call provides 128Kbits/s; two or more calls can be joined together
technically to provide higher bandwidth.
In the past, users had to employ expensive leased lines, or order a special
circuit from their telephone company for the duration of the call: these
circuits typically cost about Pounds 1,000 per hour for a trans-Atlantic
call; over ISDN, the cost is closer to Pounds 100. The low cost of ISDN -
which has only become widely available in global business centres in the
past 18 months - has already been important for the growth in sales of
roll-about video conferencing systems.
Vendors such as Picturetel are looking at an increase of 60-70 per cent in
sales this year over last year. And Heidi Aghnami predicts a compound annual
growth rate in revenue of 103 per cent from video conferencing equipment for
the years 1992-1997. Another factor has been the decreasing cost of the
hardware. The average roll-about unit costs between Pounds 12,000 and Pounds
20,000 - reflecting a fall of more than 50 per cent on the Pounds 40,000
price tag two years ago. The PC systems will cost between Pounds 3,000 and
Pounds 5,000. These are expected to show an even faster increase in sales,
with a predicted annual growth rates of 156 per cent in the next three
years. Such predictions are attracting new participants - which will sharpen
market competition. Azlan, a UK-based network distributor making its first
moves to distribute video conferencing, sees increasing demand from its
customer base, especially for systems which can link in to local area
networks.
Azlan will sell roll-about systems from Sony Broadcasting - itself new to
video conferencing - and is assessing offerings from pc system suppliers.
Nick Coutts, group strategic marketing director, expects a surge in demand
next year when prices have settled down even further - 'for all sorts of
technology products there is a price point of Pounds 2,000 per seat above
which it becomes hard to justify. In about 12 months, video conferencing
will reach that figure,' he says.
Intel, the semi-conductor manufacturer, is introducing a product called
ProShare, expecting to launch it later this year. ProShare is a PC system
which will combine its Indeo video coding software with an ISDN card and a
video camera.
But Intel departs from the other suppliers in that ProShare does not use an
H320 codec - the hardware which contains compression/decompression
algorithms to enable the video transfer down a telephone line. H320 is the
industry standard - and ensures that systems from different manufacturers
can talk to each other.
'H320 has been a market enabler,' says Steve Gandy, manager of
teleconferencing systems at British Telecom. 'It means that customers can
buy a system without having to worry who they are talking to.'
According to Heidi Aghnami, the non-standard approach is unlikely to succeed
in the long term. PC systems will not only be connected to other PCs but to
'roll-about' systems and will need standard communications protocols in
order to do so.
'Intel will have to make a firm decision to go along with industry
standards. Experience has shown that proprietary standards don't work in the
long term,' says Aghnami.
However, Intel has bought a 10 per cent stake in VTel, based in the US,
which supplies H320 systems of all sizes. Industry observers believe this
could be a move to get to grips with the standard, without overtly backing
it.
The H320 standard is also being further advanced by a consortium backed by
computer and telecoms industry heavyweights such as AT&amp;T, Hewlett-Packard,
BT, GPT, Northern Telecom.
The group focuses on PC systems. It sees a need for the video transmission
standard to address personal computer software applications in a common way,
so that customers will be able to transfer data between different software
applications across a video conferencing link.
For example, a speaker in a video meeting might want people at the other end
to have copies of spreadsheet figures. At the moment it is difficult to
achieve, but the new standard - known as the T series - aims to resolve the
problems.

FT  15 JUN 94 / Survey of Telecommunications in Business (24): More mobility
for staff - The Virtual Office
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW EMMERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Even the greatest fan of information technology (IT) and new working methods
would not suggest that the days of the conventional office are numbered.
But the rising price of travel and office space and the falling cost of
remote computing are challenging business people to re-examine the reason
for commuting to work, since many tasks which rely on information processing
can be handled just as effectively outside the office.
Often, a job can be performed equally well from home, from a hotel bedroom,
from a car or from an office hired by the hour at an airport - meanwhile,
the person at the other end of the telephone may be unaware that his
opposite number is not in a conventional office.
This is the concept behind the 'virtual office.' It is not another
expression for solitary teleworking or for working normally from home and
visiting the office once a week - although it may include these practices.
The virtual office still generally implies team work as employees of a
larger organisation, the essential difference being that information
technology removes the need for the business office to be in one fixed
location.
Implicit in this the concept is some degree of computer literacy although
staff do not necessarily have to relearn their basic skills. Home and mobile
phones can be programmed to dial straight into the employer's internal phone
system, while desktop and portable computers can also be programmed as
'virtual nodes,' meaning that users can log on to shared company computer
systems exactly as if they were in the office and connected directly into
the local area network.
No additional user techniques are required so the user is 'at work' as soon
as he or she picks up the phone or switches on the computer. Affordable
digital ISDN phone lines and easier-to-use software make logging on to
corporate networks simple, with barely any delay detectable.
Computers, photocopiers, fax machines and laser printers have also all
shrunk in size and price, allowing companies to equip their employees at
moderate cost with compact, powerful office technology that fits into any
small room.
The isolation of the virtual office can be a drawback and many employers who
favour this system ensure that staff visit the corporate office regularly to
keep in touch and to reinforce the feeling of belonging to a team.
In cases where eye-to-eye contact is felt to be important, videophone
technology from BT and others may become an increasingly affordable
solution, although it could prove a poor substitute for genuine human
interaction.
There is no shortage of lively contact in many virtual office jobs, however.
Sales people, for example, spend most of their time out meeting customers;
and customer-support staff spend much of the day on the phone. Mothers may
'telework' part-time while tending their young families. For these people,
the move to the virtual office concept means no real change to their
lifestyle.
The US sets the pace in virtual office applications, with more than 25m
people working from home. A leading domestic appliance company no longer
requires its customer service personnel to come to work, instead they stay
at home. Their employer equips each worker with a company phone and
computer, linked to the corporate database by ISDN digital telephone line.
Customer calls to the support line are directed automatically to an agent
sitting at home who can log into the company database to check parts,
numbers and prices, arrange for parts to be sent, or credit cards to be
debited and even process refunds.
Few would suggest that the virtual office will supplant the habitat and
structure of office life as we know it, nor would its exponents claim its
methods would suit all kinds of operation. But for certain tasks and
situations where staff normally work without constant supervision and have
no pressing need to visit an office daily, the virtual office will become an
increasingly viable, cost-effective and desirable way to work.
The convergence of low-cost computers and telecoms has made it possible to
set up video conference calls, work on designs and pass files backwards and
forwards without ever leaving home.
The key is the ISDN telephone line, available in the UK from BT and Mercury.
This allows computer data to be transfered by phone. The concept is called
multimedia communication and all leading computer hardware and software
suppliers have products available.
For example, in the UK, Flextel in Sandbach has introduced a transferable
phone number - users acquire a fixed phone number that does not alter when
they move location. The system 'translates' this number to their real
number.

FT  15 JUN 94 / Survey of Telecommunications in Business (21): Billed for
business - Andrew Adonis looks at calling card operators and charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The business travel sector is one of the most lucrative and fastest growing
markets for telecom operators. Calling cards are currently the main product
on offer, but a growing array of facilities is in the making, geared
particularly to the international traveller anxious to avoid language
barriers, national telecoms bureaucracies and inflated international call
charges.
In the US, calling cards are a fact of life, with more than 100m in
circulation. The three main long-distance operators - AT&amp;T, MCI and Sprint -
compete on price and service quality, and a host of other operators also
offer the facility. Touch-tone or voice-response systems for inserting PIN
numbers are the latest innovations, with a wide variety of billing
arrangements on offer to suit personal and business needs. AT&amp;T even offers
a translation service for travellers with language problems.
In Europe, calling cards have been slower to catch on, even in the business
market. This is perverse, given the relatively greater volume of
international business travel in Europe, and with it the greater
inconvenience involved in making calls - to say nothing of hefty telecoms
tariffs, particularly after the mark-up charged by most European hotels.
According to Eurodata, a tariff consultancy owned by 21 European telecoms
operators, western Europe's 9m business travellers a year make nearly 700m
telecoms transactions during cross-border business trips within Europe - 85
per cent are international. In total business travellers spend about Ecu3bn
on telecoms services. About half of that sum goes to hotels, the rest to
telecoms operators.
Calling card tariffs are at a premium to standard tariffs, but are lower
than the mark-up charged by the typical European hotel. So telecoms
operators have a large vested interest in encouraging a shift to card calls:
they stand to net a higher proportion of the existing Ecu3bn than they
currently receive, and the lower tariffs ought significantly to increase the
total size of the market.
Yet only 51 per cent of the travellers surveyed by Eurodata carry a card -
either a calling card or a credit card - with a telephone function, while
awareness of services on offer was low. In line with US experience, the
researchers found that 'when abroad, travellers will only use those telecom
services that they know from their own country - it makes sense, therefore,
to educate business travellers and promote services in their own country.'
For most of Europe's national operators, the education and promotion is just
beginning.
In the US, where AT&amp;T in particular has been battling with hotel chains for
a decade, the typical hotel charges 75 cents for access to calling card or
freephone numbers, with no attempt to bar access. Indeed, many hotels
advertise calling card access numbers in hotel bedrooms, aware that ease of
access is now a significant factor in choice of hotel by business
travellers.
In Europe, by contrast, hotels typically charge a much higher connection
fee, and sometimes bar access to calling card or freephone numbers
altogether. Moreover, unlike the US there is no standard regime: a random FT
survey of six large central London hotels found that two levied no calling
card access charge, one charged Pounds 1 per call, one Pounds 1.50, one
Pounds 2 and one Pounds 2.50. For any business traveller planning to make
more than a few calls, it pays to check on the policy of each hotel - and
travel equipped with a variety of cards.
An invitation from the FT to business travellers earlier this year to tell
their tales of telecoms woe brought a flood of responses. Tellingly, almost
all came from consultants or executives in partnerships footing their own
bills. Travellers whose bills are paid for them seem more indifferent to
extortionate hotel charges, a fact company telecoms managers would do well
to address.
A typical complaint came from a reader charged Pounds 82 by a hotel in
Nottingham, England, for a 22-minute off-peak call back home to Singapore.
His concern was not just about the size of the bill, but at the hotel's
failure to make clear the scale of the mark-up, which was disguised by a
'per unit' tariff. Another traveller in England, who used a BT calling card
to avoid the mark-up, was caught by a 'facilities charge' of 20p a minute.
('What next? A charge for incoming calls - after all, they have to be
handled by the operator . . .' he noted acidly.)
Almost all calling cards come free, with calls billed either to a credit
card statement or a separate account (which, in the case of national
operators, can often be the home telephone bill).
As a general rule, European cards are cheaper for intra-European calls, but
US cards are cheaper for transatlantic calls. For example, the US carrier
Sprint boasts a US-UK tariff on its 'Foncard' which is a fraction that of
BT's 'Chargecard.' For UK travellers, Mercury is cheaper than BT for most
long-distance calling-card calls, though BT has wider international
coverage.
However, just as the calling card is becoming as essential as a passport, it
is being superseded. In May, AT&amp;T launched what it claimed was the first
international mail box service for travellers wanting a 24-hour base for
receiving and sending messages and faxes wherever they might be.
Called 'WorldPlus', the new service gives subscribers a mail box and service
centre accessed via touch-tone or voice-response.

FT  15 JUN 94 / Survey of Telecommunications in Business (20): Converging
technologies offer commercial gain - Andrew Emmerson highlights
computer-telephone integration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW EMMERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the most overworked expressions in the information technology field
is the 'genuine breakthrough' and often the more strident the hype, the less
significant the advance.
Computer-telephone integration or CTI (also known as computer-supported
telephony), however, has been introduced with little fanfare, yet it is
generating new opportunities, not just by cutting costs but also by creating
new business possibilities.
In spite of constant talk of the convergence of computer and
telecommunication technologies, CTI is harnessing the power of the computer
to the telephone in ways never dreamed of before.
Enterprising organisations are using CTI to seize the competitive edge,
especially in enhancing their level of customer service. Providing
first-class service calls for innovative techniques and CTI provides an
effective answer.
For example, National Breakdown, a leading car-recovery organisation, needed
a mechanism enabling it to provide help more efficiently than the
competition - crucial when a stranded motorist will call on whichever
organisation offers the fastest assistance.
CTI allows National Breakdown to do this. Using the company's system, a
motorist who's car has broken down can call from a toll-free roadside
telephone. The National Breakdown operator needs to ask only two things: the
car's registration number and its location (even the latter will not be
needed once caller identification from phone numbers becomes available).
The rest of the process is automated. From the registration number, the
computer instantly identifies the driver and the details of his or her
vehicle, enabling the operator to greet the driver by name and refer to the
car make and model.
On-screen maps pinpoint the car's whereabouts and also indicate the nearest
garage, sending help on its way within minutes.
Retailing is an equally competitive field, in which CTI also has an
important role to play. In the US, MicroWarehouse uses CTI to maintain its
position as a leading mail order supplier of computer software and
accessories.
Customers ring a toll-free number and before the call has been answered,
caller identification tells the computer who is calling. Thanks to this
information and CTI, the sales agent who answers the call already has on
screen the name, address and credit card number of the customer, and the
details of his or her last order. She greets the customer by name and then
asks if, for example, the word processing software ordered three weeks ago
is satisfactory. Not only is customer business handled more efficiently,
clients feel better dealing with a firm which appears to value their custom.
In many other retail and commercial operations computer-assisted telephone
centres are already the norm. Hotel and airline reservations provide a clear
illustration of how linking telephone agents to computer systems improves
both customer service and the ability to sell effectively.
As more business is done by phone, the role of CTI will increase. Telephone
banking is now well established and buying insurance by telephone is the
fastest growing sector in the financial services market.
CTI is also used to assist staff making a large number of calls, reducing
the time wasted on ineffective calls. This application is used widely by
banks, finance houses and credit organisations for speeding up the recovery
of debts. It may increasingly be used for telephone selling, as in the US.
But CTI is not only for use by large-scale enterprises. The technique works
just as powerfully at the other end of the scale, enabling the one-man
business to take on much larger firms.
Imagine, for example, you want to turn your spare-time business into one
earning full-time profits. You sell specialist books and video tapes by mail
from your home but find that an answering machine is a poor substitute for
personal service while you're away at the day job.
By adding a card and some software to your PC and it becomes an automated
telephone attendant, inviting people to key 1 to place an order, 2 to hear
information on your products, 3 to order a catalogue or 4 to leave a message
on other business.
The cost of this add-on is less than Pounds 500 and small businesses across
the US are successfully exploiting the idea.
For large organisations, the opportunities to save costs are even greater,
using staff resources more effectively and matching the number of phone
lines rented exactly to the level of business handled.
Productivity increases of up to 300 per cent have been claimed by the Bank
of Scotland, while a debt recovery firm's collectors can now contact more
than 200 defaulters in a day compared with fewer than 60 previously.
In the US, the computer company Tandem cites the case of a system it
installed for an electricity supply company. Its client has claimed savings
of Dollars 3m a year and managed a full payback on its investment within
four months.
The UK company Datapoint quotes the experience of a bank using automated
dialling systems which it supplied. In the first year of operation, accounts
handled rose by 33 per cent, promises to pay rose by 65 per cent and all
this was achieved with existing staff. These may be exceptional cases but
they are indicative of the technology's potential.
Although CTI is a relatively new discipline, it is based on mature
technology. Organisations adopting CTI are gaining an undeniable advantage
over the competition and the market for these systems is set to grow
considerably over the next few years.
'A key factor in keeping pace with change in today's business world is the
ability to communicate efficiently at all times - whether it be by voice,
data or image - regardless of location,' says Mr Claude Olier, pictured
above, left, chief executive of eunetcom - the joint venture of France
Telecom and Deutsche Telekom.
In a deal with International Business Machines in March this year, eunetcom
 -officially spelt without a capital E - signed a contract for the delivery
of high-speed, managed transmissions services to 40 IBM locations in France,
Germany and other European centres.
The services will be controlled by eunetcom's network operations centre in
Frankfurt, which will go into operation on July 1, says Mr Olier.
The eunetcom network also has 'hubs' in France, the UK, Netherlands,
Belgium, Spain, Italy and the US. By the end of this year, hubs will be
added in Sweden, Singapore and Japan.
This month, eunetcom signed a worldwide, Dollars 200m outsourcing service
agreement with the New York-based Dun &amp; Bradstreet, a leading provider of
information, software and service, for the services currently provided by
the international 'DunsNet' network - eunetcom will provide all of D&amp;B's
worldwide data communication needs for a five-year period.

FT  15 JUN 94 / Survey of Telecommunications in Business (19): Wider
financial link-ups - Paul Quigley highlights benefits of smart card
technology
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL QUIGLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More than just a colourful piece of plastic, the smart card is set to
transform the way in which users access and benefit from communications and
value-added services.
For this reason the possibilities for strategic alliances between the
leading players in both telecommunications and banking are vast.
Many of the big telecommunications carriers already offer cards of varying
capability, based on magnetic strip technology or on account numbers which
have to be keyed in.
Banks, too, see smart cards as forming part of the process of
'disintermediation' of the financial sector, whereby customers' transactions
will be handled by phone, both fixed and mobile.
The new entrants into this arena are the digital cellular communications
operators, who are poised to unveil innovative services in partnership with
other industry sector providers.
GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) and its sister technology, DCS
1800, are part of the new generation of digital cellular networks which use
smart card technology as a fundamental part of the system architecture. GSM
smart cards, or SIMs (Subscriber Identity Modules), provide authentication
for the user to the network, and store vital personal information about the
card holder.
With older analogue cellular telephones, there was no direct association
between the user and the telephone. The user was essentially anonymous, and
the handset established its authenticity to the network.
With GSM, a handset without a SIM is useless. When inserted into a slot in
the handset, the SIM card logs on and transmits the user's encrypted
identity ready for use. What makes these cards 'smart' is an intelligent
microchip embedded in the plastic. The key technological breakthrough is in
the integration of re-usable Eeprom (Electronically Erasable Programmable
Read Only Memory) chips on to this single microcontroller.
The chips used in GSM and DCS 1800 are based around the Hitachi H8310 chip,
storing up to eight kilobytes of information. Data can be updated, and
communicated with remotely and repeatedly after the card has been issued.
This is fundamental to the power and flexibility of the SIM card.
The chip makes possible the convergence of multiple services, functions and
applications on to a single smart card. It is here that the
telecommunications carriers, the financial institutions and the digital
cellular operators see a significant marketing potential for the future.
Thus, Mercury One-2-One the DCS 1800 personal communications network
operator in the UK, in partnership with Barclaycard, has launched a service
enabling subscribers who use Barclaycard to contact specific departments for
various information and financial transactions.
The SIM connects the subscriber to a number of services by offering the
ability to select from a menu displayed on the handset screen. Though this
move is not a full-blown manifestation of a multi-service smart card (the
SIM card is still not a credit card in itself), it does represent a start.
While the Mercury-Barclaycard initiative is primarily geared towards the
management of personal finance, there are clear applications, too, for
businesses users. Companies may be able to manage variable costs more
effectively by direct payment of bills for sales force personnel or mobile
staff.
Another application being tested is the payment of tolls on roads. In
Germany, GSM smart cards are being used in conjunction with road tolls in
pilot trials to test the feasibility of payment for road usage.
In a related smart card development, National Westminster Bank, Midland Bank
and BT, have formed a joint venture consortium, Mondex UK, to exploit the
capabilities of the smart card. The Mondex partners hope that bank notes and
coins will be replaced by their smart card.
The Mondex card is like an empty electronic purse which has the ability to
download ie extract 'cash' in the form of an electronic data amount from the
user's bank account, either down a permanent or mobile phone line or through
a conventional ATM dispenser which is Mondex-compatible.
Used in tandem with the Mondex card is the Mondex electronic wallet, a
handheld device, similar in size and appearance to a pocket organiser, which
manages the electronic cash transactions to and from the Mondex card. The
user inserts the Mondex card into the Mondex wallet which transfers an
electronic cash amount on to or off the card.
The Mondex card uses the same H8310 family of microchips as is used in GSM
smart cards so it will be possible to telebank by connecting a Mondex wallet
with the card inserted to a GSM handset so the wallet and handset are
effectively turned into a mobile ATM cash dispenser.
It is conceivable that instead of a mobile subscriber paying for mobile
phone calls by conventional means such as by cheque or direct debit,
cellular operators will incorporate Mondex-type capabilities into their SIM
cards as another method of paying for mobile telephone calls. Suitably
equipped with Mondex card reading equipment, public payphones, retail
stores, hotels and many other establishments can use this method of
transaction as a substitute for cash.
The benefit to commerce is the eradication of the security risks associated
with handling and moving money; the benefits to users are manifold.
Users will need to distinguish between the terms 'multi-service',
'multi-function', and 'multi-application'. One card may have many different
functions but be used solely within one closed environment, while another
card may operate in many environments but only perform one function.
Between these two is a 'grey area' where a card may have links with
different service providers offering the same service - or many different
services.
The commercial implications of these 'one-to-one, one-to- many, and
many-to-many' permutations are complex and fraught with difficulties.
Accountability is certain to be important, and the issues surrounding it
have yet to be resolved.

FT  15 JUN 94 / Survey of Telecommunications in Business (18): Testing
ground for Europe - UK Cable Networks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Three years ago, the British government surprised the global
telecommunications industry and delighted cable television operators by
ruling that cable companies in the UK could build combined cable television
and telephone networks.
The decision not only ended the BT/Mercury duopoly, but gave the cable
network builders a head start by banning BT from offering entertainment
services over its telecommunications network for a decade.
Overnight, Britain became the most liberalised cable television market in
the world and a test-bed for cable telephony services. As a result cable
companies - many US-owned - have piled into the market.
'Everyone is watching to see what happens in Britain,' says Mr Robert
Rosenberg, a telecommunications analyst with New Jersey-based Insight
Research.
Allowing cable television companies to also offer cable telephony services
provides them with an important early second revenue stream which some many
analysts now believe will eventually overtake cable television revenues
themselves.
As Dataquest Europe noted in a recent report, 'In the early days of cable it
was generally assumed that cable telephony would be a marginal activity with
marginal costs . . . the situation has changed considerably - some operators
are now seeing revenue streams which in some instances are rivalling cable
TV revenue.'
Ms Cathy Burrows of Dataquest believes the ability to provide telephony
services has fundamental implications for the economics of the cable
industry. Although small margins on residential telephony initially prompt
the question: 'Is it worthwhile?'
Dataquest believes the answer is an unequivocal 'yes,' because it provides
cash to grow the business, lifts penetration rates and reduces churn.
'The main attraction is a combination of business and residential
telephony,' says Dataquest. Cable TV alone is calculated to have an 8 to
10-year payback period but the addition of telephony halves the forecast
payback period to between 4 to 6 years.
It is calculations like these which have fuelled the recent boom in UK cable
industry investment. So far, about Pounds 1.7bn has been spent building
cable networks passing some 3m homes, part of a projected Pounds 10bn
investment programme stretching into the next decade including Pounds 1.2bn
in the current year.
Even the decision last month by three UK cable operators, General Cable,
Comcast UK Partners and TeleWest, the UK's largest cable company, to
postpone stock market flotations because of market conditions is unlikely to
put a break on UK cable industry investment - although it may give encourage
slightly more conservative valuations.
Altogether more than 130 cable franchises have been awarded in the UK and 62
are already active with a total of about 650,000 subscribers.
Network operators in the UK claim cable telephony provides both residential
and business customers with substantial savings on call charges - typically
between 10 and 20 per cent - as well as other advantages including itemised
monthly billing. Companies market cable and telephony services together,
often with discounts for customers taking both.
But as Dataquest noted the popularity of cable telephony services has
surprised even the operators. In some areas the take-up of cable telephony
services is running at more than 50 per cent.
By the end of March, 46 cable franchises had installed almost 350,000
telephone lines - including 38,000 business lines - in more than 30 areas,
according to the Cable Television Association. A year earlier the figure was
126,500 lines including 18,000 business lines.
The association predicts that exchange line connections will rise to more
than 700,000 this year. Even then with more than 20m lines, BT's dominance
of the UK telecommunications market is not immediately threatened. But
together with Mercury marketing its long-distance network to residents,
cable operators do appear set to make a significant dent in BT's market
share.
Dataquest forecasts that business and residential customers for cable
telephony will be renting 1.5m telephone lines out of a total of 29,3m on
the public switched telephone network in 1997, representing five per cent of
the market and will generate annual revenues of almost Pounds 700m
Other research from Barclays de Zoete Wedd suggests that by the year 2000
cable could be costing BT up to Pounds 1bn a year in lost revenues. BT is
expected to recoup some of that lost revenue in charges for linking cable
systems into its trunk network, but it will be competing for business with
Mercury and other new long-distance telephone companies, including Energis,
the National Grid subsidiary, and perhaps even the cable companies
themselves.
The cable companies have already announced plans to build the backbone of a
national telecoms network to rival those of BT and Mercury in the UK by
mid-1995. They plan to create six regional networks covering London, the
Midlands, the north, East Anglia, the south coast and Scotland. Fibre-optic
and microwave links will permit the companies to run joint programming and
send regional telecom traffic across each other's networks without having to
use BT or Mercury.
Payments to BT and Mercury represent the largest telecoms cost of the cable
companies so the cable companies want to cut their interconnection
requirements to a minimum.
For the moment it seems likely that the UK will remain a unique test-bed in
Europe for the cable telephony market. As Dataquest notes, the regulatory
environment is so different in the UK from the rest of Europe that there is
little chance that other countries will allow cable TV voice telephony in
the next five years.
Some data communications services are allowed over cable in France and there
is pressure for similar concessions in other countries including the
Netherlands, Belgium and Denmark. Mr Karel Van Miert, EU competition
commissioner, last month threw his weight publicly behind a full and speedy
liberalisation of Europe's cable television infrastructure.
However the commissioner, outlining the role of competition policy in
telecommunications, said his aides were studying the impact of allowing
cable TV companies to offer services already open to competition but ruled
out consideration of voice telephony,
In contrast pressure is building in the US to follow the UK's lead and allow
cable companies to offer telephony services and vice versa. Already
so-called competitive access providers have been growing quickly competing
against the local Bell companies to provide businesses with access to the
long-distance carriers.
Now, with the backing of Congress, the US regulatory structure looks set to
loosen further.

FT  15 JUN 94 / Survey of Telecommunications in Business (17): Battles loom
in UK market - Competition will benefit the corporate sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK telecommunications market, already arguably the most open and
competitive in the world, is about to become a veritable battleground. The
main beneficiaries will be the corporate sector - particularly large
telecoms users in the City of London.
The qualification 'arguably' is needed because of the contrast with the
United States, where competition is more striking. American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph, the largest US long-distance carrier, has been forced by
competition to relinquish more than 35 per cent of the long-distance market.
In the UK, British Telecommunications still boasts a 90 per share of the
total market for telecoms services, and according to most analysts'
projections it will loosen its grip by only about three per cent a year.
BT is not under the same pressure from 'equal access' regulation as AT&amp;T.
The US carrier has to gain its custom through the explicit choice of
customers in each case; by contrast, in the UK it is only the customers
motivated to desert BT who have to act. Inertia means staying with the
former monopoly supplier.
The absence of 'equal access' in the UK undoubtedly gives BT an advantage
over AT&amp;T, and is a prime source of contention between the operators in
their claims about the 'equivalence' of their respective home markets.
However, BT's 90 per cent market share is not a meaningful comparison with
AT&amp;T's 65 per cent.
BT's main competitor, Mercury Communications - 80 per cent owned by Cable &amp;
Wireless, the UK's former imperial operator - started building its network
only in 1984; outside the City of London, and in the residential market
nationwide, it has only recently become a strong competitor to BT.
Moreover, until a change in the regulatory regime in 1991, Mercury was BT's
sole competitor, whereas AT&amp;T has had to fight head-on with MCI, Sprint and
assorted re-sellers for more than a decade.
The 1991 regulatory review gave as big a boost to UK competition as the
initial privatisation of BT and licensing of Mercury in 1984. It abolished
the BT/Mercury long-distance duopoly. And the government declared itself
ready to licence almost any competent telecoms provider to offer services,
on their own networks or across those of other operators, except for rival
international infrastructure to that of BT and Mercury.
Since 1991 more than 40 new operators have been licensed to provide UK
telecoms services, both long-distance and local (the latter still largely a
monopoly in the US). The effect has been to boost competition in all the
main sectors. Taking them in turn, there have been three main consequences
for the corporate sector:
An intensification of long-distance competition. The National Grid,
supported by the 12 privatised electricity companies in England and Wales,
has established its own telecoms operator, 'Energis', which is erecting a
third long-distance fibre-optic network across the National Grid's pylons.
Energis claims that its overheads - in both senses of the term - are
markedly lower than BT's and Mercury's, and it is about to start offering a
commercial service. Energis is touting headline figures of around 15 per
cent off existing long-distance tariffs, and has already won a 10-year
contract with the BBC to operate a broadcast network for the distribution of
the corporation's television and radio services in the UK.
Several regional telecoms operators have also been licensed, mostly
electricity companies working more or less in conjunction with Energis. The
most ambitious is Torch Communications, a joint venture between Yorkshire
Electricity and Kingston Communications (the long-time independent local
operator covering the city of Hull), which is about to launch a service in
Yorkshire geared particularly at the business market. The Leeds-Sheffield
business axis has a high concentration of corporate custom, and Mercury's
influence has been patchy in the region.
Energis and the electricity companies are thus mobilising the country's
pylons. The railways are being used for the same purpose by Mercury and
British Rail Telecommunications - a free-standing subsidiary of the
soon-to-be-privatised British Rail, which is also planning to enter the
corporate market. It was perhaps inevitable that someone would soon exploit
the canals too.
However, the form of exploitation is novel: GPT, telecommunications
equipment manufacturing joint venture between GEC and Siemens of Germany,
has clubbed together with British Waterways to offer so-called 'dark fibre'
 -a fibre-optic network without electronics for sale 'wholesale' to other
operators or businesses wishing to use it to tailor their own networks.
Fibreway, the new operator, is making only a modest investment at the
outset, but its potential is considerable if long-distance telecoms becomes
an essentially commodity business for large users and telecoms retailers.
The start of local competition, particularly in the City of London
operators.
From an industry perspective the most far-reaching advance since the 1991
regulatory review has been the emergence of competition in the 'local loop',
which appears to be overturning the conventional wisdom that competing local
supply is uneconomic.
The most visible local competition is coming from the operators, mostly
US-owned, which are building combined cable television and telephone
networks in urban areas. The cable companies believe the economies of scale
available from dual provision have revolutionised the economics of local
telecoms supply. Their commitment is far from half-hearted: about Pounds 6bn
is being invested over the next five years, with most of urban and
'commuting' Britain set to be cabled. North American telecoms operators are
to the fore, led by Nynex, US West, Southwestern Bell and Bell Canada.
Telewest, a joint venture between US West and TCI, is in the process of a
London flotation, expected to be the first of many.
So far, the cable operators have concentrated on the residential sector,
selling cable telephone on the back of television. About 40,000 business
lines have been installed out of a total of about 400,000. But as the larger
city networks - notably Nynex in Manchester - get under way, the attraction
to the corporate sector will increase.
For many large businesses, bigger gains likely to be had from the
free-for-all occurring in the City of London, where no fewer than three new
operators are currently building their own infrastructure.
Colt and MFS, both financed by well-established US operators, are building
fibre grids, inter-connecting with other long-distance operators,
specifically for the corporate sector.
Their emphasis is different - Colt is a dedicated local operator; MFS also
intends to enter the long-distance re-sale market, and has ambitious plans
to build similar grids in other UK cities, building on its US experience as
a highly successful 'competitive access provider' ('Cap'), offering direct
fibre links to the long-distance carriers for larger businesses in major
cities.
The development of a thriving re-sale market.
The City of London has also spawned a growing array of re-sellers -
operators leasing capacity from others and re-selling it at a discount to
standard tariffs, in many cases providing their own switching facilities and
direct links to customer premises.
Worldcom, Sprint, ACC and Esprit, the first three US groups and the third a
private UK-based operator with offices across Europe, are the companies most
frequently encountered in the re-sale market. They focus on international
traffic, but most also offer a re-sale service within the UK.
Worldcom now has more than 200 customers and five switches of its own, and
plans to offer an indirect access service later this year targetted at small
and medium-sized businesses.
BT and Mercury are both reacting vigorously to the new challenge. Both have
long offered volume discounts.
More than half of BT's business traffic now goes through one of five
discount schemes, offering savings of 16 per cent off standard tariffs to
the highest volume users.
Mr Michael Hepher, BT's managing director, says that volume discounts are
likely to become larger still - which will push Mercury to follow suit.
BT has also established 'Win Back' teams, targetted at larger corporate
clients. It claims the teams are already bearing fruit, with more than
Pounds 200m of business won back from Mercury. Returners include Citybank,
the Prudential, and National Power, BT claim. Since BT is not allowed to
engage in preferential pricing, its 'win back' appeal is based on overall
packages of services and customer support.
Standing back from the battleground, is the competition delivering the
corporate sector better services at cheaper prices?
One is inevitably dealing in counterfactuals, but a recent study by
Analysys, the Cambridge-based telecoms consultancy, gives some support to
the idea that price competition is serving larger business well.
The Analysys study* shows tariffs for UK businesses lower than those of
France, Germany and Italy. On the other hand, they have been so since before
the privatisation of BT and licensing of Mercury in the early 1980s. Only
for larger businesses does the differential appear to have increased with
any consistency.
Since the large corporate sector has been the most intensely competitive
over the past decade, two plausible arguments could be made. First, that
competition brings down prices more rapidly. Second, that it distorts
pricing, benefiting those sectors which are competitive at the expense of
others. As competition spreads to all sectors over the next decade, the
truth will be revealed.

FT  15 JUN 94 / Survey of Telecommunications in Business (13): Multimedia
may give US an edge - Martin Dickson on the impact of the interactive
revolution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Many acres of newsprint have been devoted to the wonders of the impending US
interactive multimedia revolution, which will supposedly transform
Americans' home lives. Many telecommunications experts think that US
businesses will be the first to want, and benefit from, some of the new
services.
And, since US telephone companies are leading the world in the deployment of
the sophisticated new communications networks needed to provide these
services, American business could gain a global competitive edge by early
adoption of multimedia offerings.
Perhaps the most obvious example is video conferencing. Equipment already on
the market allows desktop collaboration - that is, staff in different
locations working together to manipulate data, while simultaneously holding
video telephone conversations. Their desktop computers need only to be
linked by the twisted copper pair wire traditionally used to link
telephones, though they also need to have narrowband ISDN, a relatively
inexpensive technology which allows ordinary phone lines to transmit not
only voice but video and data signals.
ISDN is widely regarded as an intermediate technology, which will sooner or
late be superseded by broadband fibre optic/coaxial cable networks allowing
huge amounts of data to be send down communications lines.
But ISDN and falling prices for desktop video conference equipment may at
least establish a basic market for video conferencing services.
The quality of desktop video conferencing pictures is still far from perfect
(about 15 frames a second, compared to 30 frames for full motion film). But
Mr Andy Grove, chief executive of microprocessor giant Intel, which has
developed its own, relatively inexpensive video-conferencing system, reckons
that the industry will get to 30 frames a second in a couple of years.
He sees a substantial business market developing, since the video
conferencing can save both time and air fares. 'The cost of this thing is
demonstrably saved by one trip avoided.'
US local telephone companies are now upgrading their systems to allow a much
greater flow of multimedia services to business customers and home
consumers.
Bell Atlantic, the regional telephone company serving states from New Jersey
down to Virginia, recently announced that it had chosen AT&amp;T's Network
Systems equipment division as project leader and systems integrator for its
Dollars 11bn broadband network. Pacific Bell, which serves the Californian
market, has chosen AT&amp;T for a similar role.
But despite these bold moves, the structure of the multimedia industry, and
the telecommunications companies' role in it, remain far from clear. At
present, America's local telephone companies - notably the seven Baby Bells
spun off from long-distance carrier AT&amp;T in a 1982 anti-trust court
settlement - have virtual local monopolies on telecommunications business in
their areas, and charge long distance carriers like AT&amp;T hefty charges to
complete the last mile or two of calls.
However, both local cable television operators and the long-distance
companies would like a larger slice of the vast local market, while the Baby
Bells, which are barred from the long distance market by the anti-trust
settlement, would like to break into that area.
The local phone companies would also like to attack the local monopolies
enjoyed by the cable companies themselves. But at at present they are
forbidden by law from providing video entertainment services of their own,
though they can act as conduits for others.
There is one important exception to this: Bell Atlantic last year won a
court case giving it the right to provide its own video programming.
Following its lead, many other local telecommunications companies now have
similar cases pending before the courts. But the cable companies, in a
flurry of legal action, recently filed suits to have telecommunications
groups barred from building video networks until the Federal Communications
Commission, which oversees the industry, imposes elaborate new rules on how
these would be financed.
The cable industry argues that the local companies will try to use their
telephone monopoly profits to subsidise their multimedia infrastructure
investments, with telephone subscribers left paying higher bills. Several
bills before Congress could cut through this complex jostling for position
as the two industries converge. Lawmakers in Washington are trying to impose
a comprehensive multimedia framework on the nation, but it is far from clear
that the bills will reach the statute book as lobbyists for all sides try to
gain the upper hand for their industry.
The legislation would allow new competitors, including cable companies, the
right to compete with local phone companies and use their facilities to
interconnect with consumers. Phone companies would be freed to enter the
cable market. The Baby Bells would be allowed into the long distance market
 -though there is strong disagreement over how quickly.
The US wireless market, which is growing strongly, is also in a state of
considerable uncertainty. Participants are anxiously waiting for the FCC to
set a timetable and final rules for the auctioning off of licences for
personal communication services - small, lightweight mobile phones which
could provide a significant challenge to the established cellular telephone
industry.
The PCS lobby claims that further delays could damage PCS's chances of
competing against cellular and other wireless technologies, such as enhanced
specialised mobile radio. The FCC is widely expected to hold auctions next
December.
The only certainty in all this is that the US telecommunications industry is
set to go through several more years of upheaval and consolidation as it
experiments with the best regulatory and corporate structures for the
multimedia age.
But whatever emerges seems likely to have a strong competitive framework,
which should be good news for business customers as it will hold down
communications costs.

FT  15 JUN 94 / Survey of Telecommunications in Business (16): Tiger leaps
into video-on-demand business - Canada is aiming for a new national
'information delivery infrastructure'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEOFFREY WHEELWRIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The quest for diversification faced by many of the world's largest
telecommunications organisations is well under way in Canada - where the
roles of governments, as well as the existing near-monopoly of a few large
telecommunications and cable television providers are changing.
On the cable television front, some of the country's leading cable
television providers (the largest of which has diversified into the
provision of long-distance telephone services) were given a boost last week
by the announcement from the Canadian Radio-Television and
Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) that it would grant approval for seven
new English language and two new French language speciality television
channels for marketing next year.
The move follows months of hearings by the CRTC of some 48 applications for
the provision of services - and the announcement by the country's leading
telephone companies that they wanted to get into the entertainment business
via the planned 'information highway'.
A survey which was conducted by one of the country's leading polling
organisations - the Toronto-based Decima Research - over the time period
when the hearings were under way - found that 72 per cent of the respondents
believed that Canada's competitiveness in the next five to 10 years would
depend on the country's ability to provide a 'sophisticated information
delivery infrastructure'.
Respondents to the Decima poll were reported to have seen key roles for
federal and provincial governments, industry, and academia in developing
information infrastructure.
The poll also apparently showed the need for co-operation among those four
big groups with findings that 92 per cent of respondents believed
technological changes now taking place would fundamentally alter the way
people did business in the future.
Furthermore, 74 per cent felt Canadian society would see more changes in the
next two years than in the last 10; 60 per cent believed technology had
improved the quality of life for the average Canadian.
The poll also showed that 85 per cent agreed that most businesses and
governments had not yet fully realised the economic potential of the
information highway.
It is perhaps with these results in mind that in April the Stentor group (a
consortium of the country's largest telephone companies) revealed plans for
a broadband information highway that, it estimated, would require some
CDollars 10bn of new investment and would create 12,000 jobs.
The group predicted that between 80 per cent and 90 per cent of Canadian
businesses and homes would have access to these new services by the year
2005 under what it called the 'Beacon Initiative'.
The plan calls for the establishment of high-tech wonders - such as
'virtual' courtrooms, virtual classrooms, remote diagnoses by doctors and
'video-on-demand' movies.
Stentor appears willing to put its money where its mouth is in making this
investment, however, with announced plans to spend some CDollars 500m on
network enhancements, the creation of a new company to supply multimedia
software to the establishment of a venture capital fund to assist small
companies that want to create produces for use on the 'highway'.
Rogers Communications, the country's largest cable television provider, is
fighting back and recently announced plans for consumer trials of a new home
video delivery technology developed in the US by Microsoft, the computer
software giant, and TCI, the US cable television firm.
The Microsoft/TCI venture (which has been code-named 'Tiger') marks the
first of many much-publicised moves into the fast-growing 'video on demand'
business.
Microsoft says that it will provide a fully scalable media file-server
solution that can be used from desktop computers right up to the citywide
deployment of cable television images.
Computer companies Compaq and Intel have also demonstrated the first
continuous-media server hardware based on this Tiger technology.
The idea behind it is that it should provide a lower-cost way of delivering
video-on-demand by using standard personal components and asynchronous mode
transfer (ATM) switches as part of the delivery mechanism - bringing down
the cost of entry into this pioneering market.
Microsoft says that it will allow thousands of users to gain 'split- second'
access to thousands of media files (such as movies, music videos or TV
shows) and allow laserdisc quality control of them - including the ability
to pause, reverse, fast-forward and jump ahead to specific parts of the
media file being currently played.
Mr Nathan Myhrvold, Microsoft's senior vice president, advanced technology,
says he hopes this move will start to dispel the notion that only very
high-end, expensive systems can be used to deliver video-on-demand.
'Some people assume that video-on-demand is a hardware problem for massively
parallel machines, but it's really a software issue,' he says.
'Once you have the right software, you can implement it in many ways - on
personal 'Tigers' for individual or workgroup use, corporate 'Tigers' for
small or mid-sized private networks or city 'Tigers' for large-scale,
metropolitan service areas.'
Tiger is based on Microsoft's existing Windows NT Advanced Server software
and will be tested in Seattle by employees of both Microsoft and US cable
television giant TCI as part of a pilot project this year - with more
widescale testing in Canada, Seattle and Denver in 1995.
The data from these tests will partly determine the eventual release date
for any products based on Tiger.
Microsoft is betting that Tiger will appeal strongly to cable television,
telephone, utility and private network companies and will be used to deliver
services such as telecommuting, video messaging, information navigation,
corporate multimedia servers, television post-production work, shopping
kiosk production and business transaction processing.

FT  15 JUN 94 / Survey of Telecommunications in Business (14): Signposts on
the digital highway - Geoffrey Wheelwright on the shake-up in North America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEOFFREY WHEELWRIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The North American telecoms industry is in the grip of an acquisitions and
reorganisational frenzy brought on by a desperate desire to remake itself in
advance of the arrival of the much-hyped 'digital highway' or 'information
superhighway'. Governments and cable television interests also want to get
their own way in deciding the path this 'highway' will take, so the rush has
been on to make deal after deal that will give telecommunications 'content'
to offer users of the highway and enough strategic partnerships to make sure
that their particular section of the highway is not a dead end.
The truth behind all this hype is that the future could see the creation of
two or more digital highways in the US. One is likely to be controlled by
cable and satellite TV operators and the other by regional phone companies.
Given the huge political and financial will required to make such a thing
happen, it is most likely to take place first in the US (with much of Canada
probably coming along for the ride) - and much later, if at all, in the UK
and Europe.
For the past few years, as groundwork for the digital highway has been laid,
companies in both sectors have been scrambling to build strategic alliances.
AT&amp;T and the regional Bell operating companies (known as RBOCs) have built
the largest number of alliances with technology companies - while cable
television firms are scrambling to catch up.
The strongest political supporter of the information highway concept is Mr
Al Gore, the US vice-president, who has vigorously championed its
development in US political circles and has repeatedly spoken of what he
thinks its impact will be. One of his biggest pitches to US taxpayers to
support the development of the information highway has been on the subject
of job creation.
'All . . . applications (for the information highway) enhance the quality of
life - because they do, they will spur economic growth. After all, even the
quickest glance at the telecoms sector of the economy shows what it means
for jobs,' he says. 'Over half of the US workforce is now in
information-based jobs. The telecoms and information sector of the US
economy accounts for more than 12 per cent of the GDP. And it's growing
faster than any other sector of our economy. Last year total sector revenues
exceeded Dollars 700bn. And we exported over Dollars 48bn of
telecommunications equipment alone.
When AT&amp;T sold the first cellular phone, they said there would be 900,000 of
them by the year 2000. We have 13m now. And it's still 1993. The predictions
for mobile telephone users for the year 2000 now total 60m. This kind of
growth will create thousands of jobs in the communications industry. But the
biggest impact may be in other industrial sectors where those technologies
will help American companies compete better and smarter in the global
economy. If we do not move decisively to ensure that America has the
information infrastructure we need, every business and consumer in America
will suffer.'
So the real question in many people's minds is who will control access to
the highway - as well as the stops of interest along the way. The telecoms
and entertainment businesses have made the most noise about how they think
they will control the way the information highway develops - but they
apparently have not reckoned with the determination of the personal computer
industry. In particular, they have not taken account of the enthusiasm of
America's second richest man - Mr Bill Gates, co-founder and chief executive
of Microsoft - for the development of this delivery system.
He believes that the PC industry will be a key player in the development of
a national and international information infrastructure - and already has
advanced plans for Microsoft's role in that infrastructure. Bill Gates see
the starting point as information services delivered to millions of
consumers through devices attached to 'interactive' television sets.
'There will be a new device in the home connected up to the so-called
information highway that will be a replacement for the video game or the TV
or the PC,' he says. 'You will be able to call up any movie or show that has
ever been made. You'll be able to call up advice on medical things or
shopping or travel. You'll be able to find people of common interests, to
video conference with people that you know.
'It will be quite a general purpose device. It will take a lot of businesses
and change them. It will require a lot of software to do that well. There
are many software companies, including Microsoft, that are starting to see
this opportunity. We've hired several hundred people to work on this even
though it won't come to realisation for over five years.'
Bill Gates says the company 'won't get any revenue for at least three years'
from this project and 'will spend many tens of millions on it in the
meantime.'
So what is it that has given Microsoft such huge volumes of patience? The
simple answer is the realistic chance to make every home in America spent
money on Microsoft software. The software would be contained within the
system that delivers the information to the TV set.
Microsoft recently gave a demonstration of how this service could augment
existing TV entertainment. People watching a live baseball game, for
example, could use a handheld controller (not unlike the kind provided for
use with video game systems) to choose from a series of on-screen pictures
(to the left-hand side of the main picture) to bring up on-screen statistics
on either of the teams, any of the players, up-to-date out of town scores,
current position of players on the field  - and even order tickets (using a
credit card) to the home team's next game.
By tuning to an all-music TV channel, meanwhile, people can augment their
viewing with information on the artists singing the song, details about the
album it came from, what other albums the artists had released and, of
course, the chance to order the album by credit card.
The ultimate mix of computer technology, consumerism and TV, however, would
come with use of the shopping channel - where consumers could design
'virtual shopping malls' in which they were the only customers. These would
work by having the consumer designate which shops they would like to
frequent (from either an on-screen or published catalogue) and the system
would then respond by displaying a videogame-style representation of a mall
with shop fronts.
Consumers can then use the handheld controller to 'walk through' their
custom-designed on-screen malls - stopping at the shops whose goods they
might be interested in buying. These would be represented by on-screen shop
fronts which, when entered, would be replaced with an on-screen catalogue of
the goods available in that shop.
Mr Gates says that many telecom companies are talking to him about this plan
 -including US West, TCI, Time/Warner and AT&amp;T - 'it's the feeding frenzy or
gold rush around digital convergence,' he says. 'There are many people who
are trying not to be left out of the activities.'

FT  15 JUN 94 / Survey of Telecommunications in Business (15): Battle of
converging industries - US cable companies have bold plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US cable television companies, which have enjoyed spectacular growth over
the past 20 years, now plan to compete for telecommunications business with
telephone companies, as the characteristics of the two industries converge.
To take one example: in the city of Rochester, in upstate New York. Time
Warner, the local cable television company, intends to offer a telephone
service as early as next year in competition with Rochester Tel, the
existing telephone monopoly, which is voluntarily opening up its market.
Technological breakthroughs mean that customers will soon be provided with
interactive multimedia communications services, delivered down the wires
which each company runs into US offices and homes.
The cable companies, therefore, want to expand their current range of
broadcast offerings to include interactive services - such as home shopping
 -and telecommunications services, which may include forms of wireless
communications as well as wired ones. For their part, the telephone
companies want to invade the cable companies' entertainment territory.
Late last year this convergence of interests led to several merger proposals
 -with a lot of ballyhoo - between cable and telephone companies. Notable
among these was a scheme to enable Bell Atlantic, the regional telephone
company, to take over Tele-Communications, the leading cable company, in a
deal that could have been worth up to Dollars 22bn.
However, the Bell Atlantic deal fell apart. So did a less ambitious alliance
between Southwestern Bell and Cox Enterprises. The companies concerned laid
the blame on the Federal Communications Commission, the regulatory agency,
which has forced the cable industry to cut the rates it charges for basic
services by 17 per cent. It is now uncertain whether the two industries will
compete head-on, rather than co-operate, to provide America with new
multimedia services, or whether alliances will make a comeback, albeit on a
less grandiose scale. A mixture of both seems likely.
In recent years, the cable companies have been nibbling away at telephone
business traffic, because they own several so-called Competitive Access
Providers - companies in metropolitan areas operating highly efficient fibre
optic networks which cream off corporate bulk traffic. But full
telecommunications competition, across a broad range of customers and
services, still faces considerable regulatory and business hurdles.
First, the local telephone companies have long been cosy, state-regulated
monopolies: regulators allow them to make a decent return on their
investments, so long as they fulfil an obligation to provide a 'universal
service', enabling anyone to have a telephone at home at reasonable cost.
Competition is beginning to break down this system, but there is still a
long way to go. In Rochester, Time Warner's way to enter the market was
smoothed by Rochester Tel itself, deciding that it was in its own best
interests to create competitive local conditions.
Rochester Tel recently won approval to split itself into two: a closely
regulated transmission business and a less regulated service operation. It
agreed to interconnect its own system's customers and those of Time Warner,
and to stabilise its prices for seven years.
Other local telephone companies are hardly rushing to copy Rochester,
although Ameritech, the large Chicago-based company, has offered to open up
its market (provided it is allowed to enter the long-distance market from
which it is currently barred).
But much of the pressure for change is likely to come from the cable
industry. For example, in Montgomery County, Maryland, which encompasses a
large suburban swathe of Washington DC, the local cable company is seeking
regulatory approval to start offering a telephone service in competition
with Bell Atlantic, the local telephone company.
There is an additional twist here: the Montgomery cable company is itself
owned by a large 'Baby Bell' local telephone company, Southwestern Bell. It
would be the first time a Baby Bell local telephone company had competed
with *something in here (HP) *
one of its siblings.
Regulatory restraints apart, many cable companies face capital constraints
in building the modern, sophisticated systems required to operate a fully
interactive entertainment and telecommunications network. The industry is up
in arms over the 17 per cent rate rollback demanded by the FCC, which is
estimated to have cut some Dollars 3bn from the sector's Dollars 20bn
revenues.
At the same time, the much larger regional telephone companies are in the
throes of huge capital investment programmes to advance the information
highway. Bell Atlantic recently said it would spend Dollars 11bn on network
improvements in the next five years.
Mr Reed Hundt, the new chairman of the FCC, denies that the price cuts will
delay building the information super-highway. He says the agency will
closely monitor the effects of cuts on the sector and make adjustments, if
necessary.
The industry also complains that the FCC has taken away its incentive to add
new channels to its systems - although a large number of television
production companies have planned new networks focused on subjects as varied
as golf, antiques and health.
In order to encourage new services, the FCC says cable operators can take a
7.5 per cent profit when they add a basic cable channel to their system, in
addition to recouping their costs. But the cable companies, which use to
have more scope to raise consumers' bills when adding channels, say the FCC
has offered too little to make additions financially worthwhile. As a
result, they are now more interested in unregulated services, such as
pay-for-view films, home shopping, or 'a la carte' channels, which the
viewer selects and pays for in addition to the basic cable service.
But despite the current gloom in the cable industry - which contrasts
sharply with the euphoria at the time of last autumn's Bell Atlantic deal -
the sector seems certain to play an important role in the multimedia
revolution by virtue of its programming skills and technological base.
The local telephone companies may be less ardent suitors, but it is possible
that cable companies will link up with large long-distance operators - AT&amp;T,
MCI Communications and Sprint - which are all keen to expand their tentacles
into the local arena. They would be formidable rivals to the regional phone
companies.

FT  15 JUN 94 / Survey of Telecommunications in Business (11): Soaring
popularity - John Williamson reviews the facsimile market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLIAMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Thomas Cook Holidays, the long-haul arm of the giant travel company, makes
extensive use of facsimile to service its network of 363 agents and
communicate with numerous overseas hotel groups and representative offices.
Like many other high volume users, the company has found that a value-added
fax service - in this case, BT's 'FeatureFax' - can take the sweat out of
getting its messages across.
With an estimated 46bn pages of information sent and received in 1993, fax
is now the world's most important text-based messaging technology. The
popularity of the medium is based on its ability to handle a free mixture of
handwritten or printed text, graphics and photo images.
It also helps that terminals conform to a set of international standards to
guarantee any-to-any message transmission, and that the operation of a fax
machine requires only basic manual dexterity. According to an AT&amp;T estimate,
15 per cent of business telephone calls are now fax calls.
In some respects, however, fax has become a victim of its own success.
Traffic levels are now so high in some industries that people have to queue
to use machines, and called numbers are often engaged. Manual fax operations
can also be laborious for businesses which have to circulate the same
information to hundreds or thousands of destinations and installing banks of
additional fax machines and telephone lines to spread the load can be
prohibitively expensive.
Servicing a large fax mailing list and verifying the success of individual
message delivery can be a logistical nightmare.
Value added tax network operators offer a variety of solutions to the
problems faced by businesses.
'Broadcast' fax involves users such as Thomas Cook sending a document with a
distribution list to the operator's service centre.
Computerised facilities then forward the document to servers controlling
hundreds of fax machines which in turn transmit the document virtually
simultaneously to all the intended recipients.
This kind of service usually generates an individual header for each fax,
automatically retries engaged numbers and provides a transmission record for
the customer. Another value-added offering is 'store-and-forward,' with
customers specifying the time of document delivery. This enables texts to be
held over in a computer for transmission at off-peak call charging periods
as well as delivery of individual messages at pre-arranged times.
Both broadcast and store-and-forward fax save time and money, and release a
user's fax machine to receive urgent incoming messages.
Newer services include 'follow-me,' in which travelling business executives
dial into a fax centre to have their messages re-routed to different
locations; and fax-on-demand, in which information is retrieved from a
database in fax form by callers using a telephone keypad to specify the type
of information required.
Fax recognition is similar but employs special software to interpret
requests for information from marked-up standard forms or typed text.
In Japan, a centre for innovative fax systems, personal fax retrieval
services have been established for some time. In these systems, a caller
uses a public fax machine to lodge a message in a numbered electronic
mailbox for subsequent retrieval at any fax machine designated by the caller
a correspondent.
According to Vans Markets Europe, a continuously updated market research
report by the UK's Ovum telecoms consultancy, the supply side of the
European value-added fax market is characterised by the involvement of two
distinct types of company - the public telecommunications operators (PTOs)
and the niche suppliers.
Ovum says the market leader in 1992 was Cable &amp; Wireless with an estimated
16 per cent share of the business. Other big suppliers in that year were
AT&amp;T, whose EasyLink pioneered valued-added fax service in the region at the
beginning of the decade, and BT, Onisourco, Italcable, France Cable at
Hadio, Deutsche Telekom and Sprint.
While the larger niche players operate their own X25 pocket data networks,
their smaller counterparts rely on the public switched telephone network
(PSTN), in some cases simply re-selling PTO services.
The niche suppliers hail from a variety of backgrounds. Some, such as Vital
and Graphnet, have their origins in data-coms and messaging. Others, such as
Ascom and Comwave, started out as telecom equipment makers.
In the short term, the commercial prospects for value added fax in the
region look bright. Ovum estimates European service providers earned about
Ecu36.3m in 1992 - a figure that is projected to grow twelve-fold to Ecu436m
by 1997.
The market has four main drivers: the present day ubiquity of fax machines;
the relatively high price of 'smart' fax machines which replicate some of
the services of the value-added operators; keen competition in the market;
and the desire of large fax users to cut costs. However, high levels of
growth are unlikely to be sustained indefinitely. A challenge to third party
fax services is evident with X400 e-mail, already preferred by many
multi-site users for internal communication.
More serious competition will arrive in the form of integrated electronic
messaging. An example is the addition of fax gateways to local area
networks.
Such technology eliminates the inefficiency of converting electronic output
to paper before its electronic transmission over fax lines.

FT  15 JUN 94 / Survey of Telecommunications in Business (10): Route to
paper-free trading - Paul Taylor reports on developments in 'electronic
commerce'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Since the mid-1980s a new concept - 'electronic commerce' - has crept into
the lexicon of business. The widespread use of personal computers and their
growing integration with telecommunications systems has begun to made
paper-free trading a real possibility.
Two business tools, electronic data interchange (EDI) and electronic mail,
are central to the operations of electronic commerce - both are value added
network services which allow their users to improve business efficiency by
substituting electronic forms for their paper-based counterparts.
EDI enables two organisations, usually customer and supplier, to exchange
business documents using standard electronic forms and their own computers
linked through a service provider who acts like a central post office,
routing the documents and messages to their destination and handling any
'data translation' needed between different computers or message standards.
Generally, EDI is a faster, cheaper and more reliable means of exchanging
information than the traditional paper-based business transaction chain and
it provides other benefits including setting up an 'audit trail' which
enables an organisation to check and validate electronic documentation.
These benefits have spurred growth in the use of EDI in the US, where it
originated, and more recently Europe, particularly in the UK. Ovum, the
technology consultancy, estimated last year that the EDI market in Europe,
including customer software and support, will triple in size from just under
Ecu200m (Dollars 232m) in 1992 to about Ecu600m (Dollars 696m) in 1997.
The UK and the Netherlands are the most mature EDI markets in Europe
although France, Spain, Sweden and Germany are catching up fast. Among the
service providers the market leaders in Europe are IBM and General Electric
Information Services (Geis) which have pan-European networks and services.
In the UK, the market is dominated by International Network Services (INS)
with an estimated 55 per cent market share. INS was jointly owned by Geis
and ICL until recently when Geis bought out its partner - a move which
industry analysts suggest signals the growing consolidation and
internationalisation of the EDI market.
INS provides three main EDI 'communities,' INS-Tradanet, the main service
for retailers and their suppliers, Brokernet for the insurance sector and
Fleetnet for the fleet leasing-management sector. The biggest, INS-Tradanet,
handles more than 6m documents a month .
Between 8,500 and 10,000 companies and other organisations in Britain are
estimated to be using electronic trading and the number has been growing by
about 20 per cent a year. But there is still much room for growth.
Other research, highlighted by Denise Fellows, EDI Business Manager at Sema,
the leading systems integration group, shows that even among companies which
have signed up for EDI only a small percentage are trading with more than
100 companies and a very large percentage are trading with less than 10.
Ovum's latest Vans Markets, Europe report notes that 'the EDI market in
Europe continues to grow steadily,' and that, 'most large organisations are
now using, implementing or trialing EDI.' However the report also noted that
small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) continue to show much more
resistance than was expected to the adoption of EDI.
Part of the reason for this may be that the advantages of adopting EDI for
the large organisation with a high volume of regular transactions are
relatively tangible and easy to justify on the basis of cost savings.
However, the advantages for the smaller company are less immediately
obvious.
As Sema's Denise Fellows, said at a recent conference: 'Over 70 per cent of
EDI-users in the UK are 'doing' EDI not because it has been planned or even
because they want to, but purely because they have been forced by a major
customer into using EDI to replace the current method of transferring
documents.'
In future, she believes the growth of EDI will be driven by two separate
types of enterprises - organisations which take on EDI as 'an enabling
technology' because they are adopting new business practices such as
centralised purchasing, and large organisations including nationalised
industries 'where people are looking at EDI because they feel they can use
EDI as a lever to introduce business change.'
Other changes are also under way. In the past, most EDI traffic has been
based on industry specific or proprietary application protocols. According
to one estimate there are 26 different versions of standards in the world,
including 15 in Japanese.
However, most new user-communities are basing their services on Edifact (an
international standard) - and many existing communities using proprietary
application protocols are moving towards Edifact. By 1997, Ovum predicts
that 90 per cent of EDI traffic in Europe will be based on the Edifact
standard compared with less than 50 per cent last year.
EDI users are also becoming increasingly sophisticated. Originally, EDI
tended to be used only for basic transactions such as ordering and
invoicing. However, as familiarity with electronic trading has grown, so has
the range of information transmitted over EDI links and the number of
different document types has grown to around 200.
Unlike EDI, electronic mail is a non-interactive service based on sending
computer originated messages across a computer or telecommunications
network.
Single terminals connected directly to public services account for almost 90
per cent of e-mail traffic in Europe, but by 1997 Ovum estimates this will
have dropped to 20 per cent with the remainder accounted for by gateways to
private e-mail systems.
In the US, according to a survey by the Virginia-based Electronic Messaging
Association, the number of e-mail users is rising by 17-19 per cent a year
and, as in Europe, a growing number of companies are extending their
internal e-mail systems to customers and suppliers using service providers.
Meanwhile, the Clinton administration set out an aggressive timetable for
the implementation of electronic commerce in government in a policy
statement last autumn.
All US government departments will be required to have systems in place to
handle electronic documentation by 1997. The move will affect the more than
300,000 companies - including foreign-owned businesses - which trade
regularly with the US government.

FT  15 JUN 94 / Survey of Telecommunications in Business (12): Lower-cost
options - Advances in packet switched data services
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
For many types of enterprise, buying-in a packet switched data service is an
attractive proposition. With each user's traffic sharing a service
provider's network facilities, the packet option can be a low cost method of
communicating data.
Contracting-out the provision and management of the service also frees user
resources and allows the organisation's staff to concentrate on the core
activity.
Networks based on the internationally-standardised X25 packet switching
protocol have been particularly successful in the industrialised economies
over the last two decades.
Apart from the transfer of general in-house data between simple terminals at
different corporate locations, X25 is widely used for applications such as
electronic mail, electronic data interchange, database access and
information retrieval, and a broad spectrum of message transactions
including automatic teller machine operations and credit card authorisation.
The French Minitel Videotex service, which logged 1.1bn calls in 1993, also
runs on an X25 network.
This all adds up to large sums of money for the telephone companies which
operate public packet switched networks and the independent providers of
managed data network services. According to Vans Markets Europe, the
continuously updated report from the UK's Ovum telecommunications
consultancy, the two categories of packet operator generated business worth
Ecu2.65bn in Europe alone in 1992.
While Sprint claims to be the world's largest packet network operator, Ovum
says that the three European market leaders are networks operated by
national telephone companies - France Telecom's Transpac, Telefonica's
Iberpac, and Deutsche Telekom's Datex-P. Ovum estimates that BT's GNS has
been eased out of fourth place by the Unisource combine of PTT Telecom
Netherlands, Tolia of Sweden and the Swiss PTT.
Among the biggest non-telephone company packet operators in the region are
the airline service organisation, Societe Internationale de
Telecommunications Aeronautiques, IBM, GEIS, Sprint and AT&amp;T/lstel. Ovum
forecasts a European X25 value added network (van) market worth Ecu4.8bn by
1997.
Alan Taffel, vice president of marketing at Alcatel Data Networks, a big X25
system vendor part-owned by Sprint, attributes the success of the technology
to three main factors.
Firstly, its designers specified comprehensive error checking and management
capabilities, allowing it to run over virtually any type of network,
including those with poor quality links - 'we used to joke you could run an
X25 network over barbed wire,' says Taffel.
Secondly. X25 has built-in protocol conversion allowing it to connect
dissimilar types of terminals. Thirdly, it has an access control mechanism
for security purposes.
The price paid for the ability to run over poor quality lines is that X25
typically operates at modest speed. Although, as Taffel points out, X25
equipment can operate at up to 2mbits/second much of the installed base has
a speed ceiling of 64kbits/s.
Given that the quality of transmission links in many networks has improved
dramatically since X25 was first designed, some experts now regard its error
correction capabilities as an unnecessary overhead, and consider the
technology unsuitable for high volume, high speed applications such as local
area network interconnection.
'The technology really is too slow for many applications,' argues Simon
Goodwin, network marketing manager at AT&amp;T in the UK. 'It's rock solid but
very inefficient.'
Part of the gap between packet performance and corporate requirements is
filled by frame relay. This is essentially a stripped-down version of X25
which, without heavy error checking overheads, can run at speeds up to
45mbits/s. Even on a 64kbits/s link, data throughput with frame relay can be
10 times higher than with X25. At present there are around 10 frame relay
network operators in the US, many offering international connectivity, 17 in
Europe, eight in Asia, five in Canada, three in the Middle East and one in
South America.
In practice, frame relay is the first of a clutch of very high speed
packet-based services and technologies. One fast packet service originated
in the US is the Switched Multi-megabit Data Service (SMDS). This appears in
such networks as the Super Joint Academic Network (Superjanet) built by BT
to link about 50 universities research establishments and hospitals around
the UK and to carry a mixture of voice, data, image and video traffic. Both
frame relay and SMDS can be run over asynchronous transfer mode (ATM)
networks.
Synoptics, a leading ATM vendor, says the technology is optimised for
emerging, computer-intensive multimedia applications.
The commercialisation of ATM could herald a big shift in the structure of
the telecoms industry overall. ATM: Vendor and Operator Strategies, a recent
report from UK telecoms consultancy, Analysys, suggests that power will
shift to corporate users who are already installing ATM and concentrating
functionality and added value inside the boundary between private and public
networks.
'The player with the most to lose from ATM is the telecoms operator,'
comments Peter Aknai, one of the report's authors. 'ATM threatens to reduce
the operator's dominant role in the telecoms value chain to that of a
commodity bit carrier.'
The fast packet, multimedia age will be equally challenging for the
independent van operators - 'if they can't transport that volume of data, if
they can't connect the applications, then they are going to be
marginalised,' says Don Eungblut, managing consultant and a specialist in
network services with PA Consultants.

FT  15 JUN 94 / Survey of Telecommunications in Business (9): Europe lags
behind - Andrew Adonis on a contrast in paging markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Until recently, Europe's paging industry was at a loss to know how to
counter the relentless rise of the mobile phone. The main casualty has been
the consumer market, barely tapped by the pager, but the business sector has
also languished.
Three explanations are put forward - technological, cultural and commercial.
With its limited versatility, the pager is supposed to be inherently
inferior to the mobile phone and destined for the museum. The fate of 'one-
way cellular' telepoint services, such as Hutchison Whampoa's 'Rabbit',
wound up last year, are cited to underline the point.
Culturally, Europeans are often claimed to be naturally averse to indirect
means of communication. On the commercial front, most of the companies
operating paging networks derive the bulk of their 'mobile' revenues from
their cellular phone businesses, where subscribers are far more numerous and
margins higher. So, it is argued, paging inevitably gets pushed to the side.
The technological and commercial arguments are valid - up to a point. Many
of Europe's paging operaters are indeed obsessed with mobile telephony; and
in the long term, technology will doubtless kill paging. But given the high
price of cellular phones, both to buy and to service, the paging obituaries
appear to be rather premature.
The contrast between the US and Asia's booming paging markets and the
lacklustre European scene ought at least to give pause for thought.
With 760,000 subscribers, the UK is Europe's largest paging market. CIT
Research, the London telecoms consultancy, predicts that across western
Europe the paging market will increase from 3.1m to 5m over the next decade.
The US, by contrast, has about 21m pagers. Singapore has more than 600,000,
Hong Kong 1m, Taiwan 1.4m and Japan 7.7m.
According to CIT, the Asia-Pacific region as a whole has 18.94m paging
subscribers, which it estimates will more than double within a decade. China
is the largest growth market, but all countries are likely to see rapid
growth.
'It's largely cultural,' says Mr Duncan Scott, CIT's mobile analyst. He
compares Hong Kong with Australia which, proportionately, has far fewer
subscribers and a paging market resembling that of the UK.
However, the experience of Sweden over the past year cautions against the
cultural alibi. A little over a year ago Mr Jan Holmgren, paging marketing
manager for Telia Mobiltel, an offshoot of the state telecommunications
operator Televerket, launched a campaign to sell pagers in the high street
and shift charges from a monthly rental to a per-call price charged to the
caller. It has been a startling success, despite Sweden's 10 per cent level
of cellular penetration.
'The crucial thing was to study the telephone market, not existing mobile
markets,' says Mr Holmgren, an ex-Motorola executive. TM market research
showing a potential paging market of 1.9m out of Sweden's 8.5m population.
'But people wanted a charging structure more attractive to the consumer.'
Nearly 100,000 pagers have been sold through retail outlets in the 14 months
to May. Pagers are for sale on the Swedish high street for as little as
SKr1,000 (Pounds 87), with no connection fee. Between 9am and 4pm the
calling charge is SKr6 (about 50p) and at other times and all day at
weekends, it is SKr1.5 - a huge price differential with mobile phones.
The new regime has had almost as great an impact on the business market as
on the consumer market. TM's traditional subscriber network has grown from
about 70,000 to 102,000 since last year's launch of the 'calling party pays'
(CPP) option, while a proportion of the new CPP customers are small
businessmen.
Other European operators are studying the Swedish experience. Portugal,
Finland, Swirzerland, Ireland and Germany are either about to launch a 'CPP'
service, or seriously considering doing so.
In the UK, Mercury Paging - the third largest network operator after British
Telecommunications and Vodafone - has taken a tentative step with the launch
in March of a quasi-CPP service. Customers buy their own pagers for about
Pounds 70, after which callers pay to leave messages at Mercury's '0881'
premium rate - 39p a minute at peak rate, 25p at other times. But customers
still have to pay a monthly subscription - Pounds 8.50 for national
coverage, against more than Pounds 30 on the standard rental-plus-calls
alphanumeric option.
'Already 2 per cent of calls into our bureau are on the new service,' says
Mr Chris Neary, Mercury Paging's managing director. 'It gets over the
initial perception that paging is expensive - for businesses as much as
consumers.' With growth in the UK paging market of only 5 per cent last
year, he views the move as essential to restoring the late-1980s record of
about 20 per cent.
However, large monthly rental-plus-service charges based on zonal divisions
remain the norm in the UK - except for Hutchison, which has only one zone
for the whole country. Vodapage and Mercury have three zones. BT has six,
its tariffs guide resembling a railway timetable.
Pagers come in three sorts:
the simplest and cheapest is the tone-only radiopager, which bleeps to alert
its owner that someone wants to get in touch with him or her. BT's option
costs Pounds 10 a month to rent and use for one zone - or Pounds 6 if you
own the pager.
the numeric radiopager uses a small screen to display numbers - the phone
number of the person who wants you to call, or a coded message. It costs
Pounds 18.50 a month to rent and use with a bureau service from BT (one
zone) - or Pounds 14 on the purchase option.
the alphanumeric radiopager, which has a small screen showing text and
numbers, typically up to about 400 characters though some display more. With
a bureau service this costs Pounds 28 a month to rent and use from BT -
Pounds 20 on the purchase option.
However, published price lists do not have a lot of meaning in the corporate
environment. Large businesss users - taking 100-plus pagers - can get 'up to
35 per cent off published prices,' says one marketing director.
The main development in the UK market has been the reduction in the number
of operators, down from seven to four in three years. BT has more than 50
per cent of the market, with 418,000 subscribers; Vodapage  - Vodafone's
paging subsidiary - has about 200,000 - including subscribers to Aircall;
Mercury has about 130,000, and Hutchison 30,000.
The most popular recent service innovation is the personalised bureau
answering service ('Hello, this is Joe Blogg's office  ..'). Even the local
plumber can now pretend he has a 24-hour secretary.

FT  15 JUN 94 / Survey of Telecommunications in Business (8): From blueprint
to reality - Paul Taylor looks at advances in satellite-based services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Within five years a new generation of telecommunications satellites is
likely to provide a truly global mobile telephone service, using light-
weight pocket-sized handsets.
Already, plans for satellite mobile communications systems such as Iridium,
Globalstar and Inmarsat-P have become a hot topic for discussion in the
industry.
Geo-stationary satellites play a key role in fixed and mobile
telecommunications networks, providing voice, data and video links over
continents and oceans, maritime and aeronautical communications where
land-based systems are not an option and global positioning and tracking
services for military and commercial customers.
On both sides of the Atlantic they are increasingly used to provide
cost-effective two-way Vsat (very small aperture terminal) satellite voice
and data telecommunications services to businesses. Datamonitor, the market
research organisation, expects European satellite business service revenues
to grow from about Dollars 140m in 1991 to Dollars 365m in 1997 - the
fastest growing segment of the satellite communications market.
Satellites can also provide telecommunications facilities to geologists,
journalists, aid-workers and others in remote regions of the world using
briefcase-size portable terminals, such as those supplied by Inmarsat, the
London-based 74-member International Maritime Satellite Organisation.
Inmarsat uses five operational satellites to provide services to 40,000
customers, most of them in its specialist maritime and aeronautical markets.
Geo-stationary communications satellites usually operate at an altitude of
around 22,300 miles. In contrast, most of the latest proposals are based on
low-earth orbit (Leo) satellites which operate at between 400 and 1,000
miles.
Over the past few years, about half a dozen Leo-based systems have been
unveiled by international consortia. As Mr Robert Rosenberg of the
Washington-based Insight Research organisation points out, 'it doesn't take
a lot of money to slap a proposal down.'
Turning these blueprints into reality is likely to be considerably more
difficult and as KPMG Peat Marwick concluded in a recent study for the
European Commission, 'limits on finance and radio spectrum probably mean
that only two or three of the systems will ever reach the launch stage.'
Among the front-runners are the Dollars 3.4bn Iridium project, conceived by
Motorola, the US-based electronics group, and the Dollars 1.8bn Globalstar
project developed by Loral, the US defence group.
Iridium will be based on a 'constellation' of 66 small Leo satellites
weighing 1,500 lbs ringing the earth at a height of 420 nautical miles.
Handsets for use of the system will be dual-mode, also allowing calls to be
made on the local cellular network where available.
When a call cannot be routed via the terrestrial cellular network it will be
relayed to the nearest satellite, transferring between satellites if
necessary before being beamed down through one of 15 to 20 terrestrial
gateways connected to the public telephone network or direct to its
destination.
Last August Motorola announced that after years of funding the research
itself, it had raised Dollars 800m from an international consortium,
including Raytheon, Lockheed and Sprint of the US, Bell Canada and a
consortium of 18 Japanese companies including Sony, Mitsubishi and Kyocera
as a first stage towards financing the Iridium project.
As prime contractor for Iridium, Motorola will be responsible for designing
and building the entire network and has a Dollars 2.8bn contract to maintain
and operate the system for five years after its commercial debut in 1998. By
then, Motorola's stake in the project is expected to have fallen from 34 per
cent to 15 per cent.
The financing agreement appears to have given Iridium a lead in the race to
build a satellite-based mobile telephone system based on Leo technology once
the US Federal Communications Commission approves licensing later this year.
However, Iridium is likely to face fierce competition from Globalstar which
has secured Dollars 275m of funding from an international consortium that
includes AirTouch Communications (formerly PacTel) and Qualcomm of the US,
Alcatel of France, Deutsche Aerospace, Vodafone of the UK and Hyundai
Electronics of Korea.
Globalstar will use 48 Leo satellites orbiting at 750 nautical miles. It has
been designed by Loral as a low-cost global access satellite-based mobile
telephone system. Globalstar telephones will be similar in size and cost to
digital cellular telephones and will be able to make and receive calls
anywhere in the world.
A key feature of the proposed Globalstar system is that all calls will be
set up and processed on the ground by a distributed gateway system. Loral
claims the ground processing not only permits a more efficient, less complex
and cheaper satellite network, it also uses, rather than bypasses, existing
communications carriers.
Because Leos are closer to earth than Geo-stationary satellites, they will
work with much less powerful - and therefore smaller, lighter and cheaper
equipment - Globalstar's dual-mode handset is expected to cost about Dollars
750.
But there are also disadvantages. Leo satellite technology is costly and
largely untested. The satellites themselves will have a relatively short
life span - between five to eight years for Iridium satellites compared with
10 years or more for conventional Geos.
In addition, so as to provide reliable global coverage many more Leos are
needed than would be the case with their higher-flying counterparts. This
also means a large number of launches, and an extended roll-out period.
In an effort to overcome some of these technical and other problems and meet
the concerns of some its members Inmarsat, which had originally planned to
build its own Leo system, has opted instead for a system based on a new
intermediate circular orbit satellites orbiting at 10,000km.
The Inmarsat-P system will cost Dollars 2.4bn and be developed by an
affiliate company, at least 70 per cent owned by Inmarsat and its
signatories, which will also invite outside investment. It will use 12 to 15
satellites and be operational by 1999 or 2000.
To supplement revenues from voice traffic most of these new satellite
systems also plan to provide facsimile, paging, computer data and position
determination services.
This will bring them into direct competition with another group of network
operators who plan to use 'little' Leos to provide non-voice
telecommunications services - and with Teledesic, a Dollars 9bn satellite
communications project backed by Mr Bill Gates, chairman of Microsoft, and
Mr Craig McCaw, of McCaw Cellular Communications, the No 1 US cellular
telephone company.
Teledesic's plans call for 840 little Leos to be put into orbit 435 miles
above the earth. The system, due to come into operation by 2001, is designed
to deliver high capacity data, video and voice services worldwide using
receivers and small antennas installed in homes and businesses.
Just how large a market there will be for these voice and other services by
the end of the century is the subject of considerable debate. KPMG's study
suggested that the value satellite delivered mobile phone services will
reach Ecu10-20bn a year within the next decade.
Among the prospective network operators, Iridium expects to have 1.5m
subscribers by 2002 while Globalstar expects to be collecting Dollars 1.5bn
in revenues from 2.7m subscribers by the same year, with subscriber number
growing to 16m by 2012.
Nevertheless, some analysts question whether Leos make economic sense as a
mass market voice telecom delivery system in competition with much cheaper
terrestrial-based networks, while others caution that there are still
formidable non-economic obstacles to be overcome, including the vexed issue
of who should license and regulate these new global telecommunications
services.

FT  15 JUN 94 / Survey of Telecommunications in Business (7): The price of
progress - Paul Quigley compares tariffs on the GSM digital cellular
networks around the world
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL QUIGLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As mobile telecommunications become part of the central information highway
within businesses both large and small, the technology itself will be of
less significance than the cost benefits it delivers.
Yet, while GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) is taking up an
unassailable position as a world-wide technical standard for next generation
digital cellular communications, wide variations in tariffs remain.
Connection charges, and monthly access and call charges - the individual
chargeable elements of GSM operators' tariffs - all show striking
differences . Some GSM carriers, operating in markets with limited or no
competition, can exploit their domestic market by offering inflated tariffs
compared with those of neighbouring countries. Others, in highly competitive
cellular markets, are offering low GSM tariffs on a par with existing
analogue cellular tariffs.
Where value-added tax (VAT) rates are high, such as in Denmark (25 per
cent), Sweden (25 per cent), and Finland (22 per cent), GSM tariffs are
still among the lowest. But in countries where VAT rates are lower, such as
Luxembourg (15 per cent) or where there is no tax to pay, such as in
Switzerland, GSM tariffs are often high.
Over the last twelve months, more than 60 per cent of GSM operators have
reduced prices for peak rate call charges. The largest reductions in prices
have been made by Comvik in Sweden, and by the two Portuguese operators, TMN
and Telecel. France Telecom and its rival network, Societe Francaise du
Radiotelephone (SFR) have also reduced peak rate call charges by around 20
per cent, but are still the highest in overall cost terms.
In Switzerland and Luxembourg, peak rate call charges have increased by 64
per cent and 55 per cent respectively in the last year, as the Swiss and
Luxembourg telecoms authorities make the most of the absence of competition
in GSM.
At the other extreme, Dansk Mobiltelefon which has more than 70,000
subscribers on its Sonofon network, compared with around 5,000 at this time
last year, has increased peak rate call charges which were previously much
too low.
How do tariffs line up for a typical user on the business tariff rate who
uses a GSM telephone within the boundaries of the home network for thirty
minutes per day, during the peak rate period, for five days a week, over a
forty-eight week year?
French users are likely to be paying the highest prices for GSM. France
Telecom's Itineris network which has been in commercial service for nearly
two years has the highest overall cost at present, and a fairly low
subscriber total of around 150,000.
SFR tariffs are also high in relation to other countries. Total costs have,
nevertheless, fallen on both French GSM networks by up to 20 per cent over
the last year.
In Germany, where GSM is experiencing rapid growth (with more than 1.2
million subscribers), tariffs are also high. Mannesmann Mobilfunk, the
D2-Privat network operator, and Deutsche Telekom Mobil's D1 network have
maintained high tariffs levels because of overwhelming demand, but D2 is
down overall while D1 is up on last year.
Vodafone of the UK has reduced tariffs some 17.5 per cent in the face of
growing domestic competition. In Italy, state operator, SIP continues to
exploit its monopoly position ahead of the award of the second GSM operator
licence this year, as does Belgacom Mobile in Belgium.
There are other variables affecting overall GSM cost. 'Unitisation' - the
way a call's duration is divided into time slices - varies from periods of
one second for some operators to sixty seconds for others. Unitisation of
calls is an area where GSM operators can differentiate themselves from
competitors.
In addition, some GSM operators charge a 'multiplier' based on a percentage
of the particular type of call made, such as whether it is a domestic call
or a cross-border 'roaming' call. The cost of GSM terminals can vary widely,
too, from one country to another.
New GSM services this year have been set up or are being opened in Jersey,
Latvia, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Spain, and the United Arab Emirates.
Second operators are also starting services in countries where there is
already a GSM operator in the market. These include Germany (with the launch
at the end of May of the DCS 1800 network, E-Plus) as well as Cyprus,
Hungary, and Italy.
Beyond 1994, it is expected that Russia and China will launch regional and
provincial GSM networks, and GSM off-shoot, PCS 1900, is expected to make
big inroads in the US digital cellular market. In the meantime, the mass
consumer market is being invited to join the personal communications
revolution.

FT  15 JUN 94 / Survey of Telecommunications in Business (3): Monopoly walls
breached - Liberalisation of telecom systems unleashes a wave of competition
across Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The liberalisation of Europe's telecommunications systems has gathered
unstoppable momentum. After years of acrimonious tussles, the ramparts of
the EU's state telecommunications monopolies are exposed, and the walls have
been been breached in numerous places.
It would, however, be a mistake to believe that a fully competitive regime
is imminent. In their core voice market the former monopolies are likely to
remain entrenched for years to come. Competition will be most intense in the
data, mobile, satellite and value-added fields where the former monopolies'
existing resources are relatively less substantial.
Indeed, the building of the much-vaunted superhighways is likely to add to
the armoury of the public telecommunications operators (PTOs) as they face
the opening of their core markets. Given the expense of extending fibre into
local networks - estimated at Pounds 15bn for the UK alone - the PTOs are
almost certain to to be the principal operators of fibre grids. Until
effective inter-connection regimes are established, other operators wishing
to offer services across these networks are likely to find it hard to gain
fair access.
The key to effective competition is the liberalisation of infrastructure and
the establishment, country by country, of a regulatory structure independent
of the PTO and its sponsoring ministry. For either policy to be made
effective, at least in the early years, the government must be firmly
committed to competition and prepared to distance itself from the immediate
interests of its PTO.
In Britain, where competition is the centrepiece of the government's
telecoms policy, both of the above policies have been pursued. Yet BT
commands nearly 90 per cent of the UK market, a decade after the abolition
of its monopoly and the licensing of a competitor. In EU states where
governments are less enthusiastic about the merits of competition, rival
operators will face a steep climb to establish themselves.
Nonetheless, they start with three clear advantages over Mercury, BT's
initial and largest competitor. In the first place, competition is already a
fact of life in sectors other than voice. Almost every EU state has now
licensed at least one competitor to the PTO in mobile cellular
communications. Barely a year after its launch, Germany's Manesmann mobile
consortium has at least as many subscribers to its GSM cellular network as
has Deutsche Telekom to its GSM network, and a third German operator has
been licensed.
In France, the SFR competitor to France Telecom is thriving. In Belgium, the
Netherlands, and Italy rivals launch services this year or next. Some of the
mobile operators are known to be interested in moving across to fixed-line
voice services when the opportunity arises.
The satellite and data sectors have also been opened to competition, with
rival operators to PTOs now well established. A recent ruling in May by
Germany's Federal Cartel Commission on illegal subsidies paid by Deutsche
Telekom to its data subsidiary could prove seminal.
The Cartel Commission found that Deutsche Telekom has been seriously
hindering competition in Germany's liberalised data market, in particular in
the provision of X25 data networks (known as 'Datex-P' in Germany), through
subsidies from its monopoly voice and leased lines business.
In all, subsidies of DM1.9bn were found to have been paid since 1989, the
year Germany's data market was opened to competition. The findings have been
referred to Germany's federal economics and telecommunications ministries,
which will have to decide what measures to take. Meanwhile, Deutsche Telekom
claims to have reformed its accounting system to end the illicit subsidies.
Four features of the case stand out, all of which are likely in due course
to recur across the EU in the far larger voice sector. First, the case was
brought by an association of independent telecoms operators, VTM, whose
members now have about 10 per cent of Germany's DM800m a year data telecoms
market. The Cartel Commission would in all likelihood not have taken up the
case but for the complaints. Secondly, the VTM association includes a host
of national operators - BT, AT&amp;T, and the Swedish, Dutch and Swiss PTOs for
starters.
Unlike Mercury in the UK, the big players in the newly liberalising markets
will be operators well versed in the tactics and practices of monopolists -
and thus, perhaps, better able to seek to expose them elsewhere.
Thirdly, it took five years from liberalisation for the claims of unfair
cross-subsidies to be decided upon by the German competition authorities,
and even then, the remedies remained unclear. Without dedicated telecoms
regulators able to impose inter-connection regimes and accounting
separation, entrants will find it slow and exhausting to gain legal redress
for perceived unfairnesses in the competitive regime. Finally, Deutsche
Telekom had, by common consent, gone some way to meeting the complaints even
before the Cartel Commission's ruling.
How fast will competition in voice services develop? It has already started
in cross-border virtual private networks (see article on outsourcing,
below), and elaborate call-back and other regimes are being established to
circumvent monopolies for some international traffic from business
districts. But for the voice market as a whole, outside the UK and possibly
the Netherlands, competition is likely to have to wait until the 1998
deadline agreed by EU telecoms ministers last year - extended to 2003 for
Spain, Portugal, Ireland and Greece, and to 2000 for Luxembourg.
In practice, the extensions are unlikely to last as long as that. Mr Michel
Carpentier, head of the EU's telecoms directorate, told a recent FT
conference: 'We do not expect that all the countries eligible for derogation
will fully use the additional five-year period.
'This has already been our experience for the initial services
liberalisation step.'
What happens after 1998 - or whenever competition is formally permitted in
each state - depends upon a number of key decisions still to be taken, and
in particular on three: the extent to which infrastructure is liberalised,
the nature of national telecoms regulation, and the structure of regulation
at EU level.
The EU's Bangemann committee of industry leaders, set up last year to
examine steps towards the 'information society' and due to report to this
month's EU summit, will make a tentative nod in all three directions. Its
summary conclusions, already published, argue for an acceleration of
competition. It calls for 'opening up to competition, infrastructures and
services still in the monopoly area', a significant development in the EU's
position if endorsed by the Council. It also advocates 'removing
non-commercial political burdens and budgetary constraints imposed on
telecoms operators' - which could be taken as a clear reference to
privatisation, the only sure means of keeping the politicians out of the
month by month operations of the PTOs. The group also stresses the need to
speed up the process of standardisation of network architecture to ensure
full interconnection of networks and interoperability of services.
However, the Bangemann group appears to have sidestepped the critical area
of EU regulation, concluding lamely: 'An authority should be established at
European level whose terms of reference will require prompt attention.' Such
an 'authority' could be anything from a US-style Federal Communications
Commissions to a feeble college of national regulators - and its terms of
reference anything from promoting competition and settling inter-connection
disputes to acting merely as a forum for exchanges of views between national
regulators.
A recent speech by Mr Karel Van Miert, the EU's competition commissioner, to
a meeting of solicitors at S J Berwin, highlights the importance of the
decisions still to be taken on regulation. Article 86 of the Treaty of Rome
gives the EU tough powers over companies dominant in their markets; but,
noted Mr Van Miert, no formal prohibition decisions against PTOs have been
made since one against BT in 1982.
Why? 'My services,' he said, 'have been struck time and again by the
reluctance of companies - even very big and powerful companies - to lodge
formal complaints against PTOs for fear of suffering reprisals.'
Furthermore, he commented, 'lack of evidence' often precludes investigation
even of those cases brought, for evidence is invariably hard to gather 'in
view of the unsatisfactory accounting practices applied by the PTOs.'
In other words, accounting separation, and a pro-active regulatory
institution armed with first-hand knowledge of the internal world of the
PTOs, is the essential pre-requisite for a fully competitive market. Whether
the EU will prove able to establish a regulator equal to the task remains to
be seen.

FT  15 JUN 94 / Survey of Telecommunications in Business (4): Still a
Cinderella sector - Mobile Data Services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mobile data remains the Cinderella of the telecommunications industry.
Although there is almost universal agreement that mobile data services will
eventually grow into a substantial market, for the moment they are
overshadowed by the spectacular growth of cellular radio voice
communications.
The failure of mobile data to live up to early expectations has already
prompted some suppliers to re-assess their strategies and reconsider
investments.
In the UK, for example, Hutchison Mobile Data ceased marketing its fledgling
dedicated data service last autumn and is now expected to offer mobile data
services on its recently launched Orange digital Personal Communications
Network later this year.
Ovum, the market research organisation, noted in a report on mobile data
published last year that early users of mobile data services have
experienced 'the very real and measurable benefits from mobile data in terms
of reduced costs, increased efficiency and improved customer service.
Furthermore, they have usually achieved a rapid payback.' The report
conceded however that, 'despite services being available on cellular and
public data-only networks, the market has been slow to develop. Data-only
networks are facing an uphill struggle to attract subscribers and the number
of data users on the cellular network is in the region of 2-5 per cent of
the user base.'
By the end of last year Ovum estimated that there were just 325,000 users of
mobile data in North America and Europe with organisations using the
services falling into two main categories, vertical markets, particularly
the service industries, and early horizontal markets involving industries
with a significant service element in some aspect of their business.
Typical applications involve transferring engineering, customer or product
information to and from portable computers, or retrieving information from
mobile data terminals such as meter readers. Other applications include
keeping track of truck fleets or railway wagons.
Despite this relatively slow start Ovum, like most other forecasters,
believes that mobile data will soon take off - 'by the year 2000 there will
be more than 9m users of mobile data services in North America and Europe.
This will represent a Dollars 7.6bn market for terminal equipment, network
infrastructure, systems integration and airtime revenue.'
Ovum says the driving forces behind the increased adoption of data services
are a more mobile workforce; real user-benefits; a growing demand for
computing and communications on the move, and a growth in data
communications generally.
It suggests, however, that the market is constrained by factors including
customer concern over competition between mobile data services technology
and the availability of networks, price of equipment and excessively complex
and expensive applications, lack of market understanding and belief that
perceived risks outweigh cost benefits.
Two of these factors, customer concern about which service to buy and the
availability of networks, are crucial.
The mobile data market, while developing competing technologies, is
conspicuous for its lack of standards, making potential customers nervous.
This situation is exacerbated by the bewildering array of data delivery
systems.
In the UK, excluding pager traffic, mobile data services are offered by
cellular telephone network operators, dedicated mobile data network
operators and private and public access mobile radio networks - all using
incompatible standards and equipment.
All of the options have their attractions and drawbacks. For example, it is
possible to transmit data over an analogue cellular telephone system such as
the Cellnet or Vodafone networks in the UK, but this is generally more
difficult, slower and considerably more expensive than transmiting data over
the fixed public switched telephone network. As a result, relatively few
business customers use cellular telephone systems to transmit data.
For analogue cellular customers who require data communications, one
solution is to to use a cellular modem. For example in the UK Vodafone's
mobile data service uses a cellular data link control (CDLC) modem enabling
customers to transmit and receive error-free data over its network. It is
also possible to use a cellular line interface (CLI) with a standard modem
and some mobile phones.
Data transmission over the new generation of digital cellular telephone
systems, such as the GSM and PCN services in Europe which have just started
up, should be simpler, faster and more reliable.
The GSM specification includes a facility which will eventually allow any
terminal - for example, a portable facsimile machine or a notebook computer
 -to be plugged directly into the handset.
In the US, analogue cellular network operators led by AT&amp;T's subsidiary,
McCaw Cellular Communications, are upgrading their networks to accommodate a
new 'open' technology called cellular digital packet-switched data (CDPD).
CDPD enables data to be sent in blocks over existing networks using the
'spaces' between voice traffic. Because it provides the advantages of
digital transmission without the need for expanded system capacity, it is
very cost-effective option.
For customers who require voice and data communications from a moving
vehicle, a two-way public access mobile radio service such as the UK's
National Band Three (NB3) is soon to be available.
NB3 customers buy their own communications equipment and then pay a fixed
monthly subscription. They do not pay call charges.
Meanwhile in the US, Nextel, a six-year-old New Jersey radio dispatch
service company, has been using digital technology from Motorola to create a
nationwide network offering voice, data and paging as well as its
established dispatch services.
Nextel's services are expected to compete with the high speed and low cost
wireless data links provided by dedicated packet-switched data networks such
as Ardis - a joint venture between IBM and Motorola - and Ram Broadcasting
in the US.
Similar packet-switched mobile data networks, mostly based on Ericsson's
Mobitex technology, have been built or are planned throughout Europe.
In the UK where there are three surviving mobile data networks, Cognito,
Vodafone's Paknet and Ram Mobile Data - a joint venture involving US-based
Ram Broadcasting and BellSouth, France Telcom, Swedish Telcom and Bouygues.
Although subscriber growth has been slow, Mr John Jarvis, Ram Mobile Data's
chief executive, says interest is accelerating - 'we are beginning to see an
industry with mass market characteristics in terms of size and potential,'
he says.
However, he acknowledges that although there is an increasing understanding
that mobile data can make a strategic difference to competitiveness, 'senior
managers still require education on how to apply the technology to their
businesses and derive commercial advantage.'
If the mobile data market does finally shed its Cinderella image, the
competing technologies will need to work hard for custom.

FT  15 JUN 94 / Survey of Telecommunications in Business (5): Wind blows
both ways - Andrew Adonis highlights the debate of the merits of
'outsourcing'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Will or will not large organisations - particularly multinational companies
 -be enticed into contracting out their telecommunications requirements to a
single telecoms group? Put differently, do they regard their telecoms as
essentially strategic or non-core?
Upon the answer to those questions depends the realisation of the grandiose
visions animating telecom operators worldwide. Alliances, investments and
strategies are being predicated on the emergence of a burgeoning market for
'outsourcing.' The jury will probably be out for a few years. But while the
issue is decided, opportunities galore will present themselves to large
organisations - in the public as much as the private sector - seeking new
services and a better deal for their existing telecoms.
Most national operators now boast an outsourcing capacity, but the
cross-border business is set to be most competitive. Predictably, American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph and British Telecommunications, the two most ambitious
international operators, are at the forefront.
Last summer AT&amp;T launched its 'World Partners' venture with several Far
Eastern operators, while BT forged a Dollars 5.3bn alliance with MCI, the
second-largest US operator and bitter foe of AT&amp;T in the US long-distance
market. Both are aimed at exploiting the market for international
outsourcing - variously estimated at between 1,000 and 5,000 companies worth
between Dollars 10bn and Dollars 20bn a year.
The French and German state operators are also lining up, with an Ecu1bn
alliance to provide advanced services to multinationals.
However, smaller operators are just as fixated. In Europe, three of the
smaller national telecoms companies - those of the Netherlands, Switzerland
and Sweden - have clubbed together to establish their own outsourcing joint
venture, Unisource. Telefonica of Spain is in talks about joining.
Separately, Cable &amp; Wireless, the former imperial UK operator with
operations in 56 companies - is trumpeting itself as the ideal 'outsourcing
federation', and has established a special division for the purpose.
At present, the straws in the wind are blowing both ways. Surveys show
companies highly reluctant to outsource. Yet contracts are being sought and
awarded, and the regulatory regime in Europe is set to give a significant
boost to outsourcing.
A UK industry survey, carried out among 439 large companies last year by the
Telecommunications Managers' Association, last year, showed that more than
90 per cent had rejected the idea of contracting out their
telecommunications. It found that only 6 per cent had decided to outsource
the management of their telecoms. Fewer than half had considered
outsourcing; of those that had considered it, 45 per cent said they had
rejected it because telecommunications were strategic to their business,
while 44 per cent could see no cost benefit. Nearly one in four feared
'entrapment' by the outsourcer.
Mr Graham Marriner, chairman of the association, said: 'Most large companies
still see telecoms as a core activity, and are very reluctant to describe
their requirements in detail to a third party.'
Despite that, outsourcing is a rapidly growing business in the US, and a
number of large contracts have been awarded in the EU. To take but three
large European developments of the past year:
the UK government has outsourced its long-distance inter-departmental
network - covering 250,000 civil servants in 550 offices - to Mercury.
the Financial Network Association, a joint venture company between 12
national public telecommunications operators, six of them European (Mercury,
Deutsche Telekom, France Telecom, Belgacom, Telefonica and Italcable), has
been cleared by the European Commission on condition that its services were
not cross-subsidised by revenue from monopoly operations. Other members
include MCI, the second largest US long distance carrier, KDD of Japan and
Telstra of Australia. The company plans to offer specialised international
network services to the financial sector, in particular high-capacity
networks for the conveyance of data and image. It will compete strongly with
Swift, the body jointly owned by international banks to manage their main
network functions.
In April a ground-breaking contract, worth up to Ecu500m a year, was awarded
by 30 of Europe's leading multinationals to British Telecommunications and
an alliance of AT&amp;T and Unisource to build a pan-European telecoms network
linking the facilities of the 30 companies. The 30, which include Rank
Xerox, ICI, Philips, ABN Amro and ABB, have formed a European telecoms
association aiming to gain tariff reductions and upgraded services by acting
jointly to provide for their telecoms requirements.
The prospect of savings of up to 40 per cent on the companies' existing
bills for cross-border European traffic was a key stimulus to the
association. Those savings, in turn, depend upon a vital aspect of the
existing EU telecoms regime, which permits competition between carriers for
private networks, although monopolies for voice traffic will continue until
at least 1998 on public networks. The association's network qualifies as
private because companies will not be allowed to communicate with each other
across it.
The distinction is an uneasy attempt by the European Commission to encourage
the development of pan-European networks without undermining national
telecoms monopolies before state companies have time to adjust to
competition. The effect, however, will be to give a significant boost to
outsourcing via the franchising of private networks. Significantly, the
European association draws on US experience, where a group of large
companies - some of them members of the European group - operates a pan-US
private network to provide enhanced telecoms facilities at special rates.
The scope for savings is considerable. A telecoms 'benchmarking' report
carried out this year by the UK's Trade and Industry Department found that
while public network charges were broadly comparable in the US and larger
European states, the price of high-capacity leased private circuits was
vastly more expensive in Europe.
Reuters, which has the largest private telecoms network in the world, claims
that it would save 90 per cent of its outgoings for leased lines in Europe
if the equivalent network were in the US. As the DTI noted: 'Such high costs
not only increase the costs for business, they also suppress business
activity by making it uneconomic to offer certain types of service or to
carry out some business activities.'
At the end of the day, cost savings are likely to 'drive' outsourcing. The
potential for them is considerable - for the proactive customer.

Apple Computer has awarded Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC) a new
contract worth Dollars 7m over two years, to continue to manage the user
administration and billing system for the AppleLink Network Service.
AppleLink is the electronic communication and information system linking
60,000 users of Apple computers worldwide via e-mail, with bulletin boards
and libraries offering information on Apple programmes and products.
CSC, which has 28,500 employees in 450 offices worldwide, is a leader in the
information technology services sector, including outsourcing. Mr Mojtaba
Ghassemian, president of the services management division, says CSC retains
over 90 per cent of re-tendered contracts.

FT  15 JUN 94 / Survey of Telecommunications in Business (2): Enhanced
services on the way - Cellular Telephony
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS

<TEXT>
Three significant trends are evident in the cellular mobile industry across
the developed world:
First, the tentative entry of the mobile phone into the consumer market.
Second, the rise of competition between rival operators within countries.
And third, the migration from analogue to digital networks offering greater
capacity, enhanced features, improved reliability, and the capacity to
'roam' across national borders.
Yet the three are not moving in tandem. The UK has four network operators up
and running, with nearly four subscribers per one hundred people.
Belgium, Italy and the Netherlands still have only one functioning operator
apiece - in all cases the monopoly national telecoms company - with two or
fewer subscribers per one hundred people.
Even the UK appears a backwater by the standards of the United States, which
has six subscribers per one hundred people and is about to boost its already
fierce mobile competition by auctioning a host of new Personal
Communications Systems (PCS) licences.
Last year's Dollars 13bn takeover of McCaw Communications by the US giant
AT&amp;T marks a decisive turning point, giving a significant impetus to the
development of cellular telecommunications and their integration with
fixed-wire networks.
The past year has seen the more mature markets - the US and western Europe -
grow at roughly similar rates. Growth has been much faster in eastern
European, Latin American and Asia-Pacific regions, but in all cases from a
lower base. According to FT newsletter, Mobile Communications, 1993 saw the
North American market grow 43 per cent to 17.3m and western Europe grow 47
per cent to 8.8m.
By contrast, eastern Europe grew 129 per cent (but still only to 110,000),
while Malaysia grew by 64 per cent, Argentina by 220 per cent, and China by
300 per cent - to select from the other regions.
China, however, still has barely 700,000 subscribers for 1bn people - fewer
than Sweden, and only three times more than Switzerland. Nonetheless, even
in the west the mobile phone still has a long way to go before it becomes a
standard business item, let alone a mass consumer product. For all the talk
of mobile networks competing with, or replacing, fixed networks, the
virtually no organisations of any size make universal provision for their
employees to have cellular phones.
In the most populous mobile nations, the best analogy for the present state
of the mobile phone market is that of a thin sandwich in search of a thick
filling. Two thin slices of the business market are currently being serviced
 -namely senior executives on the one hand, and travelling sales people plus
the self-employed 'roamers' (plumbers, electricians, and so on), on the
other.
In between, lies a mass of the employed who get no closer to a mobile phone
that overhearing banal conversations on the train home. Typically, a company
will have a handful of mobiles available for staff on the move - but no
policy of progressively extending their use.
Henceforth, cellular phones can probably be expected to penetrate both the
business and the consumer sectors in parallel, the one re-inforcing the
other against a backdrop of progressively - but not precipitately - falling
tariffs.
Price reductions will owe something to technological advance; something to
competition between operators; and something to cultural attitudes, which at
some point are bound to make that the mobile phone as essential as the
fridge. That time may come fairly soon, if the progress of the UK market
over the past year is any guide.
In the UK, tariffs have been falling fast. After eight years when Cellnet
and Vodafone, the two original operators, levied largely unchanged and
almost identical tariffs, the past year has seen successive price cuts and a
growing diversity of tariff packages.
Eighteen months ago the two operators began tapping the low-use market, with
low subscription but high usage charges. Last summer the imminent launch of
the Mercury One-2-One network in the London region obliged them first to
drop their London tariff premium, then to introduce special discounts for
users in the London region.
The effect was dramatic. At the start of 1993, the business user had to pay
33p a minute for daytime calls in the London region.
By the year-end that had dropped to 20p for those on new London tariff
packages - though calls outside the region cost more on the tariff.
One-2-One charged business customers 16p a minute, and 8p after 9pm and at
weekends. (One-2-One caused a stir in the industry by offering free local
calls on weekday evenings and at weekends, but only on a consumer tariff of
little use to the typical business customer).
The launch of a fourth network operator - Orange, owned by Hutchison
Microtel - in April this year has not had a similar impact on tariffs. But
the Orange strategy shows a sophistication in its approach to the business
sector which may also boost the market.
Orange's tariffs feature minutes of 'free' calls bundled in with the monthly
subscription. The various packages include between 15 and 540 minutes of
free calls.
Cleverly, most of them bundle in more minutes than the average business
customer currently uses - ie between 150 and 200 minutes - but for a price
below the equivalent for the same calls at peak rate on existing Vodafone
and Cellnet networks, if paid for on a usage basis. The tariff structure is
clearly designed with the company telecoms manager and small businessman in
mind. Meanwhile, handset prices are also coming down rapidly. It is now
possible to get slim-line phones for the UK's analogue networks for under
Pounds 100. Phones for new digital networks are more expensive, but Mercury
One-2-One cut the price of its digital phones - compatible with those for
the Orange network - by Pounds 50 in the run-up to the Orange launch, taking
the cheapest to Pounds 170.
In Germany and Denmark, Motorola handsets for the digital GSM networks have
fallen to under Pounds 100 in some promotion packages.
Enhanced services are also on the way. Orange's Nokia handsets double as
radio pagers and have screens which can display messages.
Each handset can support two telephone lines distinguished by different
ringing tones. Their batteries support more than an hour's continuous
conversation.
Meanwhile, other operators are exploring the potential for integrating fixed
and mobile services as a means of boosting their business appeal. Full
integration with BT's fixed-wire service is prohibited by Cellnet's licence,
but possible departures include software enabling PABXs to switch calls to
employees' mobile phones automatically, and switching enhancements for
virtual private networks enabling calls to be passed to mobile networks
without incurring fixed-line costs.
The relationship between fixed and mobile networks lies at the heart of
future growth. On the one hand, regulatory authorities on both sides of the
Atlantic have been keen to keep fixed and mobile networks separate, to
prevent dominant (often monopoly) fixed-line operators from cross-subsiding
their (competitive) mobile operations. AT&amp;T has had to go some way to
meeting this requirement in its take-over of McCaw, to appease the Federal
Communications Commission.
On the other hand, the future must lie in convergence - particularly as
'personal numbers' and 'intelligent networks' divorces phone numbers from
particular handsets. Tellingly, the European Commission's Green Paper on
Mobile Communications, published in April, calls for the 'unrestricted'
combined offering of services across fixed and mobile networks within the
overall time schedule for the liberalisation of fixed-wire voice services
across the European Union - ie by 1998 for most of the 12 member-states.
In other words, as fixed-line monopolies wither, convergence with mobile
communications will be allowed to proceed. Given the speed of the withering,
the all-in cellular and fixed-wire package may be just round the corner -
for businesses and consumers.

FT  15 JUN 94 / Survey of Telecommunications in Business (1): A crucial role
in companies large and small - The high value of business in the financial
services sector is a powerful driving force behind competition,
liberalisation and innovation across the telecommunications industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Never have telecommunications been so vital to business success. From being
one important service among many, telecoms have become strategic to most
businesses. And as reliance on telecoms has increased, the range of the
industry's services consumed by the corporate sector has risen.
This is as true of small as of large businesses. The local plumber, who a
decade ago relied on a 'plain old telephone' and possibly a spouse to take
messages, will now very likely have a pager, a cellular phone, and two home
phone lines complete with answerphone, call-waiting, fax and other
value-added services. If he or she belongs to a larger organisation, there
might also be a personal computer networked to the parent company's billing,
ordering and messaging systems.
At the other extreme, telecoms is the lifeblood of the financial services
sector. Furthermore, the value and concentration of business in the
financial services sectors of the main industrialised countries are powerful
driving forces behind competition, liberalisation and innovation across the
telecoms industry.
Research recently completed by the London Business School for London's City
Corporation on the telecoms infrastructure of the industrial world's
principal financial centres highlights the important social, industrial and
economic knock-on effects of those trends.*
Based on a study of telecoms and financial centres in France, Germany,
Japan, the US and the UK, the LBS reaches five conclusions of significance
far beyond the financial services sector:
A financial centre's competitive advantage in telecoms is 'much more likely
to be a consequence of the differences in tariffs, product choice and
reliability than of differences in the technology employed.'
Telecoms account for about 8 per cent of the financial service sector's
spending on goods and services, a significantly higher percentage than that
spent by other sectors.
To put this in perspective, about 35 per cent of all international calls
from the US originate in New York City; 80 per cent of all telecoms spending
in France originates or ends up in Paris; more than a quarter of all the
UK's cellular mobile calls are made within London's M25 orbital motorway. In
each case the financial sector is but one aspect of the concentration, but
nonetheless a critical one.
The value to telecoms operators of business generated by financial sectors
is leading to massive infrastructure investment in them.
Fibre-optic grids and new switching and transmission technologies are
providing broadband and other advanced services down to the level even of
medium-sized businesses requiring a few dozen lines. This is particularly
true of the financial districts of London, New York and Tokyo, where the
volume of business is greatest and several operators now provide fibre
grids.
The availability of advanced services at competitive prices is, in turn,
helping to preserve the concentration of financial services.
A few years ago it was fashionable to believe that modern telecoms would
encourage a migration of business away from established centres, with
business districts disintegrating and 'teleworking' becoming ever more
prevalent. There is evidence of this in some sectors, but the LBS study
suggests that in financial services the disparity between network provision
in established centres and beyond may be having the opposite effect, acting
as a strong incentive to continued concentration.
The value of the telecoms business in financial districts is serving as a
powerful stimulus to competition between operators, with many new entrants
building their own local infrastructure to by-pass the former monopoly
suppliers and customise their own services.
Where competition is allowed, the effect has been to reduce tariffs, widen
product choice, improve overall service quality, make multiple-sourcing a
rule for most businesses - and, once again - to help preserve concentration.
In three of the five centres - New York, London and Tokyo - the market for
the carriage of 'voice' traffic over public networks is largely liberalised,
and competition between operators is fierce.
In New York, 'competitive access providers' (Caps) by-passing the local
network of Nynex, the regional Bell operator, have taken about 60 per cent
of the former monopoly operator's private-line business. Mr Richard Jalkut,
chief executive of Nynex's New York operations, says: 'They have turned us
upside down. We are doing things now which we had convinced ourselves three
or four years ago were impossible.'
For instance, Nynex now provides 1.5 MBit circuits within 24 hours, which a
few years ago used to take Nynex six months.
The largest of New York's 'Caps', MFS, has just launched a network in the
City of London, offering local services across its own infrastructure and
re-sale facilities beyond. It is the fourth operator in the City to build
its own infrastructure, and another two are in the offing.
In addition, upwards of a dozen re-sale operators are established, aiming
particularly at high-tariffed international traffic.
Take the case of one of the UK's largest insurance companies, with a large
office in the City and a network of more than 50 centres across the country.
The company now boasts three City of London suppliers - BT, Mercury, and
Worldcom, a US international re-sale operator. It is looking at both MFS and
Colt, another US operator launched earlier this year which is building its
own City infrastructure.
'I am after not just price but resilience,' says the company's telecoms
manager.
Resilience - back-up capacity in case one operator fails - is a key factor:
many telecoms managers are keen to 'dual source' to improve their
resilience; and resilience, in turn, makes them reluctant wholly to sever
their ties with the former monopoly operator, however great the price
savings on offer from its competitors.
A report by the New York City Partnership in 1990 estimated that a loss of
service in a key business district for a single day could disprupt financial
transactions worth more than Dollars 1 trillion.
Significantly, the insurance company mentioned above still sends about half
of its long-distance business over BT, on grounds of resilience.
In France and Germany, the other two centres studied by the LBS, the 'voice'
monopolies of the state operators will remain in force until 1998, under the
timetable for telecoms liberalisation agreed by the European Union's Council
of Ministers last year.
The liberalisation of mobile, satellite and value-added services has already
led to strong competition, particularly in virtual private networks for
large corporate customers.
Within a year, MFS plans to open shop in Paris and Frankfurt, offering
services within the limits of the EU rules.
What is competition doing to prices?
Without doubt it is forcing them down, but one needs to be wary of
simplistic generalisations. The graphs of price levels (see chart below),
taken from a recent study of business tariffs in the UK, France, Germany and
Italy by Analysys, the Cambridge-based telecoms consultancy, reveal a
complex picture.
In almost every sector surveyed, the UK came out with lower telecoms prices
than the other three countries. But it also had lower prices a decade ago,
before liberalisation and the privatisation of BT.
The relative gap between the UK and the others has not changed greatly over
the decade - indeed, for international calls it has narrowed significantly.
The principal UK gainers appear to be very large - 100-line plus -
businesses.
Furthermore, the gap between Mercury and BT has narrowed progressively in
the past few years, as competitive and regulatory pressures have forced BT's
tariffs sharply downwards. It is a similar picture in the US, where fierce
competition between AT&amp;T and MCI has steadily eroded the tariff gap between
the two carriers.
In mobile and other value-added sectors, competition is entrenched in the US
and is spreading fast across Europe. The UK's fourth mobile cellular
operator was launched earlier this year; the auction of PCS licences in the
US next year will further intensify US cellular competition; and competing
operators are spreading fast across mainland Europe and Asia-Pacific. In
fixed-line services, although competition is likely to be fiercest in
financial centres, the US and UK experience suggests that it will extend
well beyond in due course. 'Caps' are entrenched in most large US cities;
legislation before Congress could bust the Baby Bells' remaining local
monopolies.
In the UK, central Manchester is about to become as hotly contested a market
as central London, with three operators building infrastructure in addition
to BT and Mercury.
The trends are the same across the rest of the developed world. Australia
and New Zealand have undergone radical programmes of telecoms deregulation;
Hongkong Telecom's local monopoly is to be abolished next year; and numerous
other Asia-Pacific states are proceeding down the same road.
For businesses able to grasp the potential of choice and technological
advance, the opportunities are legion.

FT  15 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: BP share peak challenge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, CLARE GASCOIGNE and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Petroleum came within a whisker of breaching its all-time peak of
411 1/2 p, eventually closing the session a net 15 1/2 higher at 406 1/2 p.
Turnover in BP was a heavy 15m shares.
Driving the stock price ahead was some determined and sizeable buying
interest from both sides of the Atlantic, with US institutions said to have
been big buyers towards the close of business.
Dealers said that a US Energy Department paper on the export of Alaskan oil
is scheduled to go to the White House for approval by President Clinton. An
approval of the export of Alaskan oil by the US authorities is thought by
oil analysts to be worth in excess of Dollars 100m a year to BP's bottom
line earnings. The US buying interest also focused on Shell Transport, which
moved up 9 to 713p.

FT  15 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Strong close follows latest US
consumer data - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The London market's nervousness ahead of the announcement of the US consumer
price statistics proved unfounded yesterday and share prices ended an
uncertain session in good form. Supported by a turnround in bond prices, a
premium on stock index futures, and a strong start on Wall Street, the FT-SE
100 Index ended the day 23.3 points up at 3,039.6.
Equities opened slowly and were held back at first by weakness in UK gilts
as European bond markets backed away ahead of the US consumer price data.
The FT-SE 100 fell nearly 12 points in early trade but once again the
Footsie 3,000 area brought in support. More significantly, the UK stock
market separated itself from gilt-edged stocks, which were at that stage
nearly half a point lower at the longer end of the range.
Shares rallied quite quickly, and the Footsie loss was translated into a
gain of 17 points, before the market settled back to await the US data which
came in early afternoon. The London stock market was slow to respond to the
improvement in sentiment in the US but extended its gains when transatlantic
buyers appeared for British Petroleum.
The FT-SE Mid 250 Index moved in direct contrast to the blue chip Index,
falling 17.1 to 3,578.7 as a series of individually-structured option
contracts in second line shares was believed to have expired yesterday
afternoon.
Non-Footsie business made up around 58 per cent of yesterday's Seaq total of
709.6m shares. Equity volume increased sharply from the previous session
when a mere 483.7m shares traded through the Seaq electronic network and
were worth only Pounds 948.5m at retail level. Daily retail volume has
rarely dipped below Pounds 1bn ovber the past twelve months.
The focus on oil shares reflected market belief that Opec may switch to a
more aggressive pricing policy and also that the US ban on exports of oil
from Alaska could be lifted soon. However, neither factor influenced Lasmo
shares which refused to match the new offer from Enterprise Oil. US
investment funds, which hold large stakes in Lasmo, showed no sign of
selling stock yesterday after the Lasmo board rejected the latest terms from
Enterprise.
Traders said that the market had featured substantial technical switching in
both bonds and equities, with perhaps as many as six equity trading
programmes marching across the trading screens. Several very large overnight
deals, when shares sold at the previous market close are rebought the
following morning, were believed to be tax-related operations.
The renewed volatility in UK securities markets, and in particular in the
government bond sector, brought new reports of heavy losses among
marketmaking firms, which have to stake their capital on the view taken of
the market outlook.
The market was bracing itself for the announcement today of important UK
economic data. Investors are likely to focus on the average earnings
statistics for April. The previous month showed an annualised gain of 4 per
cent in average earnings, significantly larger than the markets anticipated.
The latest retail price index, the principal measure of domestic inflation
will be published at the market opening; and the trading session will close
just before Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor of the exchequer, delivers
an important policy speech in the City of London.

FT  15 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equities Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stock index futures overcame early weakness to make strong gains on the day
as the sector responded to US retail sales and consumer price data, writes
Joel Kibazo.
Active selling dominated initial trading in the Liffe FT-SE 100 contract
after it opened at 3,003. As the selling continued, the contract fell to a
low of 2,992 in the first hour of business.
The recovery in UK gilts and European bonds helped to steady the contract
and the return of mid-morning buyers saw it regain some strength. This
gained momentum with the covering of short positions by independent traders.
The US data appeared to dampen the market's recent fears on inflation,
encouraging further buying, but it was the strong response to the figures on
Wall Street which generated a squeeze in June. At the day's peak it touched
3,044 and was at a premium to cash before coming off the top to end at
3,039, at parity with cash. Traders rolled forward positions and volume in
the near month contract reached 22,345 lots, while that in September, which
becomes the lead contract on Friday, was 7,852.
In traded options, turnover returned to more favourable levels, reaching
31,629 lots, of which 10,018 were dealt in the FT-SE 100 option and 5,845 in
the Euro FT-SE. National Power led the stock options at 1,735 contracts.

FT  15 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Benign CPI data bolster Dow
rally
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US shares rallied yesterday on economic news which suggested that the
Federal Reserve was unlikely to tighten monetary policy again in the next
few weeks, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 31.71 higher at 3,814.83, its
first close above 3,800 since March 24. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was 3.27
ahead at 462.37. New York SE volume came to 288.5m shares and advances
outpaced falls by 1,269 to 820. The American SE composite gained 1.46 at
442.65 and the Nasdaq composite added 4.28 at 735.98.
The catalyst for the morning's sharp upturn was the May consumer price
index, released by the Labor Department just before the markets opened. The
CPI showed a benign 0.2 per cent increase for the month, or a 2.5 per cent
gain on an annualised basis. When the volatile food and energy sectors were
excluded, consumer prices were up 0.3 per cent. Both figures matched the
consensus forecasts of economists, relieving anxieties over a potential
sell-off in bonds.
In the event, Treasuries posted moderate gains, as news of a 0.2 per cent
slide in May retail sales reinforced the conviction that the economy was not
overheating.
Still, the gains made in the equity markets overshadowed the progress made
by bonds during the morning, as stocks continued to assert a measure of
independence.
Equity investors viewed the morning's news as favourable because it
increased the odds that the Fed would wait until the end of the summer
before lifting rates again.
Such a scenario was particularly supportive for stocks most vulnerable to a
slowing economy. The same group was in the vanguard of Monday's rally.
Caterpillar, which had led the Dow industrials during the winter, showed
fresh signs of vigour, jumping Dollars 3 3/8 to Dollars 109 3/8 . United
Technologies rose Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 67 1/2 and Allied Signal advanced
Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 37 5/8 .
The Big Three car makers also powered ahead on the favourable fundamentals.
In telecommunications, Sprint dropped Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 36 7/8 after
announcing that France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom had agreed to take a 20
per cent stake in the company. Analysts said possible regulatory obstacles
to the deal may have scared away investors. In addition, there was some
concern over the dilutive impact of Sprint's proposed issue of 85m new
shares under terms of the agreement.
Exxon continued to feel the repercussions of Monday's court ruling which may
allow plaintiffs to pursue an estimated Dollars 15bn in punitive claims for
damages arising from the Exxon Valdez oil spill.
Analysts were divided in their recommendations following the decision. AG
Edwards lowered its rating on the issue from buy to hold, but Prudential
Securities urged its clients to add to their holdings. In the cross-current,
Exxon slipped Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 59 and led the NYSE's most active list
on volume of 4.9m shares.
Canada
Toronto stocks closed lower as the 'Quebec malaise' continued to hound
equities. Analysts said mounting uncertainty over the future of the
French-speaking province is pushing Toronto shares into a downward spiral.
In contrast to Wall Street buoyancy, the TSE 300 index ended 8.2 lower at
4,198.6 and falls led rises by 394 to 351 after volume of 56.2m shares.
Eight of the 14 stock groups showed increases, however, led by golds, up
1.39 per cent. Mining and banking fell 1.34 and 1.91 per cent respectively.
Mexico
Equities finished slightly firmer after a roller coaster session, with
investors still showing signs of nerves. The market had tumbled 4 per cent
on Monday following the rejection by the Zapatista rebels in Chiapas at the
weekend of the latest peace initiative.
The IPC index was finally ahead 9.8 points yesterday at 2,300.9 and volume
was a moderate 1.18bn new pesos on 107.7m shares traded.
Brazil
Sao Paulo saw high volume ahead of today's futures index settlement;
equities closed 2.4 per cent up in local currency terms after a 4 per cent
gain seen around noon.
The Bovespa index was up a net 704 points at 30,173. Traders said turnover
was unusually large at Cr447bn due to a high volume of option deals.

FT  15 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei declines as
dollar falls against yen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A sharp fall in the dollar against the yen and jitters over the situation on
the Korean peninsula prompted profit-taking, and the Nikkei 225 average
closed 0.9 per cent down, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The index was finally off 198.84 at 21,353.97 after opening at the day's
high of 21,495.70 and declining to a low of 21,304.16 on profit-taking in
the afternoon.
The dollar's drop to the Y102 level and North Korea's announcement of its
withdrawal from the International Atomic Energy Agency offered domestic
financial institutions and investment trusts an opportunity to take profits.
Traders noted heavy selling orders around the 21,500 level.
Meanwhile, dealers were at a loss to explain the sudden appreciation of the
yen. 'Traders are blaming German politics, but it is more likely that the
lack of activity is creating a vacuum for speculation,' said Mr Dick Beason,
economist at James Capel.
The Topix index of all first section stocks shed 9.93 to 1,702.80 and the
Nikkei 300 receded 2.05 to 309.66. Declines led rises by 693 to 315, with
175 issues unchanged. Volume totalled 470m shares, against a previous 423m.
In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was 1.16 firmer at 1,403.59.
Export-oriented issues were hurt by the higher yen. Hitachi retreated Y20 to
Y1,090, NEC Y30 to Y1,260 and Sony Y50 to Y6,330. Low-priced, large-capital
shipbuilders and steels, which led the recent rally, lost ground on
profit-taking. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, the most active issue of the
day, fell Y16 to Y812.
Speculative favourites were supported by individual investors. Iseki, the
agricultural machinery maker, saw a new high for the year, rising Y17 to
Y519, and Kubota, the textile maker, advanced Y15 to Y504.
Minebea, the ball bearings company which had rallied recently on support by
speculators and dealers, lost Y24 to Y876, declining heavily for the second
consecutive day.
In Osaka, the OSE average eased 78.62 to 23,668.56 in volume of 53.9m
shares. Nintendo, the video game company, moved ahead Y170 to Y6,620.
Roundup
In the absence of Hong Kong, closed for a holiday, and weakness in Tokyo,
the region's markets searched for direction.
SEOUL was hit hard by North Korea's decision to withdraw from the
International Atomic Energy Agency.
The composite index weakened 19.52, or 2.1 per cent, to 903.72 in volume of
34.9m shares, against Monday's 30.9m, as investors retreated awaiting
developments.
KUALA LUMPUR closed off the day's lows as a fresh round of rumours of an
early general election in Malaysia prompted bargain hunting in the
afternoon. The composite index ended 4.44 down at 1,013.49, after touching
1,006.90, in volume that shrank to 183.9m shares from Monday's 461.7m.
Perstima appreciated 65 cents to MDollars 6.80 amid rumours of a change in
ownership.
SINGAPORE had a quieter day after Monday's strong showing by Malaysian
shares traded over the counter, and the Straits Times Industrial index
dipped 17.62 to 2,278.30 in volume down to 125m shares from a previous 358m.
Some rotational activity was seen in selected index stocks. Sembawang lost
40 cents at SDollars 11.10 and Inchcape fell 30 cents to SDollars 5.35.
SYDNEY was broadly higher, helped by mining stocks, which were lifted by the
rise in commodity prices. The All Ordinaries index improved 7.2 to 2,076.6
in ADollars 445m turnover.
In the natural resources sector, Western Mining forged ahead 26 cents, or
more than 3 per cent, to ADollars 8.40. BHP was 8 cents higher at ADollars
18.70 and CRA 4 cents up at ADollars 18.96.
TAIPEI ended off the day's best on late selling. The weighted index gained
25.51 at 6,098.94 in TDollars 75.7bn turnover.
The electronics sector continued its strong performance, Acer adding
TDollars 4 at TDollars 77 and United Microelectronics TDollars 3.50 at
TDollars 129. Financials were also strong, led by Cathay Life, up TDollars 6
at TDollars 264.
BOMBAY closed higher on late buying in selective shares by foreign mutual
funds, and the BSE 30 index put on 4.28 at 4,133.13. But the overall mood
was weak ahead of tomorrow's end of account in specified, or 'A', shares on
Thursday.
Indian Hotels, which is expected to announce a bonus issue tomorrow,
finished unchanged at Rs1,350.
MANILA slipped back in a market devoid of new developments. The composite
index lost 50.14 at 2,936.05. Turnover rose to 677m pesos.
Philippine Long Distance Telephone, San Miguel and Manila Electric suffered
bouts of profit-taking. The latter's 'A' shares showed the day's heaviest
fall, 2.5 per cent at 290 pesos. PLDT dipped 2 per cent to 1,830 pesos and
San Miguel 'A' 1.5 per cent to 99.50 pesos.
BANGKOK fell back as investors took profits late in the day, particularly in
the finance sector. The SET index ended 0.16 softer at 1,378.88 after
fluctuating between 1,375 and 1,390. Turnover was moderate at Bt8.5b,
against Monday's Bt7.6bn.
The finance sector was the most active with some Bt3.1bn worth of shares
changing hands. Finance One firmed Bt4 to Bt418.
KARACHI moved upwards on brisk trading in blue chip stocks as Imperial
Chemical Industries announced that it might set up a new plant. The KSE
100-share index climbed 11.47, or 0.5 per cent, to 2,230.53. ICI rose
Rs6.50, or 3.7 per cent, to Rs182.50.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Domestic institutional buying drove Johannesburg higher ahead of today's
expiry of futures contracts, while a firmer gold bullion price also lent
support.
There were late gains in gold shares after bullion seemed ready to break out
of its current narrow trading range through the Dollars 385 an ounce level
after midday, before slipping back by the close of trade.
The overall index advanced 41 to 5,762, industrials 14 to 6,723 and golds 56
to 2,121.
Among the most actively traded issues, De Beers added 75 cents at R118.25
and Anglos R2 at R247. In golds, Vaal Reefs strengthened R11 to R421 and
Kloof R1.25 to R54.75. Oryx, the developing mine, jumped 30 cents to R5.
Foschini, the retail clothing and jewellery group, moved forward R5.50 to
R107.50 following satisfactory annual results.

FT  15 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses find late support from
bonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Encouraged by lower US retail sales and CPI data for May, European bond
markets recovered from early lows yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
Equities followed suit, but dealers were inclined to question the intraday
rally, and strategists to remember the inflation arguments following this
week's West German wholesale price data, up 0.5 per cent over April and far
ahead of market expectations.
FRANKFURT went to extremes in the pre-bourse, when the Ibis-indicated Dax
index hit a low of 2,048.74, and after hours when it recovered to 2,088.44,
4.02 higher than on Monday evening.
There were sizeable recoveries in the post-bourse, with Volkswagen at
DM453.70, up DM15.70 from the day's low, and Thyssen, at DM280, up DM15. But
Mr Detlev Klug, head of sales at B Metzler in Frankfurt, said the market was
walking on thin ice.
Arbitrageurs, he said, had been talking for a couple of days about taking
the market down to 2,050; after they achieved that aim, the September bund
future recovered from 91.54 to 92.30, and short covering took over in
equities.
On the day, volume recovered from DM5.8bn to DM9.7bn, but the daily figure
covers the 24 hours until the official Frankfurt close at 13.30 local time.
In that period, the Dax dropped 31.08 to 2,074.70.
PARIS ended firmer, although the CAC-40 index drifted down to yet another
low of 1,956 before US data prompted a return to strength. The index closed
up 14.33 at 1,991.99.
Turnover was nearly FFr4bn.
There was activity in L'Oreal, the cosmetics group, following the
announcement after hours on Monday that it was to purchase four of its
distribution companies controlled by Nestle and Mrs Liliane Bettencourt,
daughter of L'Oreal's founder, for FFr8.8bn. Analysts commented that the
deal was likely to have a positive effect on earnings, and strengthen the
group's presence in world markets. The shares rose FFr51 to FFr1,145, still
17.5 per cent down from the year's high recorded at the end of January.
Pechiney, the aluminium producer, slipped FFr9 to FFr152.20 after
forecasting that 1994 would be a difficult trading year, with improvement
likely in 1995.
AMSTERDAM found support after the US data,
the AEX index, ending 0.30 down at 401.63 after a session low of 398.23.
KPN remained very active on the second day of trading, encountering
profit-taking after Monday's extremely busy performance. The stock lost 20
cents to Fl 50, but off the day's low of Fl 49.90, in volume of some 8m
shares.
KLM, up 80 cents at Fl 51.60, said that its present strategy was focused on
alliances rather than a merger with another airline.
MILAN lost 3.3 per cent as foreign investors raised cash ahead of the
Mediobanca and Mondadori issues, although prices steadied late in the
session as domestic funds returned as buyers. The Comit index registered a
fall of 24.38 to 717.95, slightly below the 720 point level at which the
market had been widely expected to find technical support.
Mediobanca picked up L154 to L15,383 after Monday's 4 per cent slide which
came as shareholders cleared the way for a rights issue to raise at least
L1,500bn.
Mondadori lost L860 to L18,500 ahead of news as the market closed that its
issue had been priced at L15,000 a share, which was at the top end of
expectations.
Fiat fell L135 to L6,498 in volume of 33.5m shares amid reports of heavy
selling by two Milan brokerages.
ZURICH reduced some of its early losses in a technical rebound after Wall
Street's firmer opening and the rally in US bonds. The SMI index finished
4.2 lower at 2,740.0.
Roche certificates helped the tone, picking up from a low of SFr6,710 to
finish SFr35 higher at SFr6,700 as BZ Bank launched 500,000 call warrants.
Interest rate worries continued, however, to take their toll on the
financial sector. CS Holding lost SFr6 to SFr575, while, among insurers,
Winterthur bearers fell SFr15 to SFr720 and Zurich bearers were SFr11 lower
at SFr1,369.
MADRID's late upswing left the general index up 1.35 at 322.38 in turnover
of Pta32.3bn. Volume was lifted by Telefonica, tipped by Prudential
Securities and up Pta40 to Pta1,860 in nearly 6.4m shares. Endesa, up Pta140
at Pta6,350, also lifted the market.
TEL AVIV fell 4.6 per cent after Bank Hapoalim, the country's largest
commercial bank, predicted slower economic growth for the rest of the year.
The Mishtanim index closed 8.63 lower at 176.88.
ATHENS reversed five consecutive days of losses, rising 2.7 per cent as
construction shares rebounded on expectations that the first inflows from
the European Union's Delors II financial aid package would become available
soon.
The general index rose 21.98 to 847.35 in moderate volume of 1.2m shares as
the more positive mood spilled over into other sectors.
VIENNA was pulled down by weak bond and foreign equity markets, and further
losses were expected ahead of Friday's option expiries. The ATX index fell
20.02 or 1.8 per cent to 1,072.78, with all 19 of its constituents falling.
WARSAW tumbled another 9.4 per cent to its lowest level since last October,
the Wig index falling 823.3 to 7,934.0, for a two day fall of 18.3 per cent.
Dealers said that some late buying suggested that the two-day slide was
losing momentum, although the worry remained that since trading remained
dominated by short-term speculators, any gains might provoke a further
sell-off.

FT  15 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets: Helsinki down 2% in Nordic slip
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM COCHRANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nordic markets, early closers by and large, derived little benefit from
yesterday's European bond market recovery, writes William Cochrane.
The exception was Stockholm, which came back from an early fall of 1.2 per
cent to end with the OMX index a token 2.26 higher at 1,102.05.
Helsinki took a 2 per cent tumble, the Hex index closing 33.7 lower at
1,657.8 as more results, particularly from Valmet, the engineering company,
and Rautaruukki, the steel group, failed to impress the market  - the shares
dropped FM12 to FM84 and FM3.50 to FM42 respectively.
Copenhagen reversed its recent recovery, with the blue chip KFX index losing
1.43 at 103.61 and Oslo's all-share index hitting a new 1994 low of 599.33
before closing 8.82 off at 600.75.
Mr Peter Tron at Unibank said that liquidity had been a major concern: in
Norway, due to Norsk Hydro's NKr4.8bn rights issue; in Sweden, fielding the
Pharmacia privatisation; in Denmark, with the debut of Tele Danmark; and in
Finland, where Nokia, a star performer, will soon be looking for more than
FM4bn.
The region, said Mr Tron, had also been depressed by bond market weakness
since February 4: in Sweden, six-month rates rose from 6.9 to 7.1 per cent
over the period; in Norway, they moved up from 4.91 to 5.24 per cent; and in
Finland they jumped from 4.56 to 5.31 per cent, the price for letting the
economy rip after a major devaluation.

FT  15 JUN 94 / Markets Report: Dollar remains weak
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Anxiety about the progress of the US-Japanese trade talks drove the dollar
lower yesterday on the foreign exchanges, while the D-Mark continued to gain
strength in the aftermath of the European elections, writes Graham Bowley.
The dollar fell against the yen, in spite of the intervention by the Bank of
Japan to support the US currency.
The D-Mark's buoyancy, arising from Chancellor Helmut Kohl's strong
performance in the European elections, exerted downward pressure on other
European currencies.
The dollar recovered some ground in later trade after remarks from Mr
Lawrence Lindsey, a member of the Federal Reserve Board, that the US economy
is 'in the midst of a solid expansion'. But analysts said the downside
potential for the dollar remained.
The US currency largely ignored the main data releases yesterday, the US
consumer price index and retail sales for May, which came in much in line
with expectations. US consumer prices rose 0.2 per cent in May, above
April's 0.1 per cent increase. Retail sales fell 0.2 per cent in May, the
second monthly decline in a row.
'There are signs that consumer activity in the second quarter has moderated
a little, but the US economy is still growing robustly. This is not evidence
of a slowdown,' said Mr Steve Hannah, head of research at IBJ International
in London. 'What has been depressing the dollar is the increasingly
aggressive rhetoric on the US trade position with Japan.'
Mr Jeremy Hawkins, chief economist at Bank of America, said: 'Recent
comments from the US authorities that they are happy with the dollar at its
present levels may mean that they will not be inclined to intervene if it
falls further.'
The Canadian dollar weakened yesterday. The Bank of Canada was reported to
have intervened to buy the Canadian currency for US dollars as it fell to a
low of CDollars 1.3875 in early trade.
The US currency closed in London at Y102.665, against Y103.145 on Monday,
and at DM1.6443, from DM1.65. In New York it finished at Y102.73 and
DM1.6461.
Sterling maintained its level against the US dollar yester-day but weakened
moderately against the D-Mark as traders remained nervous about the UK
political environment. Analysts said the pound was also weighed down by the
dollar's fall against the D-Mark.
Investors have been unnerved by talk of tax cuts to boost the Conservative
party's standing following its poor performance in the European elections
and UK by-elections. 'Tax cuts would be seen as a panic reaction to events
and would not smack of good economic management,' said Mr Hannah.
The pound lost about a pfennig to finish at DM2.4951 in London, against
DM2.5061 on Monday. It was little changed against the dollar at Dollars
1.5175, from Dollars 1.5189.
Attention today will be turned towards the UK chancellor's Mansion House
speech and important economic data, including the latest labour market
statistics and the May retail price index.
The data will be scrutinised for any sign of a pick-up in inflation. A rise
in the average earnings figure, currently at 4 per cent, could have a
significant impact on the market.
In the UK money markets, the Bank of England provided liquidity of Pounds
320m after forecasting a shortage of Pounds 300m. Overnight money traded
between 4 1/2 and 3 1/2 per cent.
The December contract on the UK futures market closed at 93.72 from 93.67,
discounting a short-term interest rate of more than 6 1/4 per cent.
Most other European currencies were depressed by the general strength of the
D-Mark and by their own political uncertainties following the European
elections.
Both the French franc and the Spanish peseta continued to suffer from their
governments' poor showing in the elections.
But in Italy, the lira was pushed down by fears that the recent
constitutional court ruling ordering the government to pay trillions of lira
in back pensions would further worsen the deficit.
The Greek drachma was pushed lower by data showing a rise in the Greek
annual inflation rate to 11 per cent in May and fears that, with the
elections over, the government will be under less pressure to support the
currency.
The Bank of Portugal intervened successfully to defend its currency. But the
Swedish krona fell sharply in early trading, led by weakness in the Swedish
and other European bond markets. It recovered some losses later in the day.
The Dutch central bank surprised the markets with a 10 basis-point cut in
its special advance rate to 4.90 per cent. It said the reduction was
justified by the strength of the guilder. Analysts were surprised that the
cut came before the Bundesbank's money market operations today.
The Bundesbank announced that it was setting a tender for 14-day repo funds
at variable bid rates. Dealers said they expected an announcement today of a
5 basis-point reduction in the repo rate to 5.05 per cent from 5.10 per
cent.

FT  15 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Latin America's vegetable
export drive runs into trouble - Excessive use of pesticides is generating
new problems and threatening markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MADELEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When a shipload of vegetables from the Dominican Republic was turned away by
US port officials last October, shock waves were felt throughout Latin
America. The vegetables - including tomatoes, peppers, broccoli, onions,
celery and peas - were considered to have too high a level of pesticide
residues.
The last ten years have shown a huge growth in the export of vegetables from
Latin America to the US. With pressing debt problems, Latin American
countries have looked to their fields as a source of foreign earnings that
could get them off the debt hook.
Encouraged to grow vegetables and fruit for export, farmers regarded
pesticides as the way to guarantee that their produce arrived in top-notch
condition. But agriculturists in Latin America are now warning that the
concentration on export crops has led to the neglect of basic foods, such as
beans, for local people and that heavy pesticide applications are leading to
the appearance of new pests and viruses, causing serious damage to crops.
Chile was the first Latin American country to embrace export crops. In 1980
it exported about the same amount of beans as it grew for local consumption.
By the early 1990s the production of beans for export, such as black, white
and pinto varieties, was running at 55,000 tonnes a year, compared with
20,000 tonnes grown for local consumption.
The country's expansion of fruit and other export crops brought about an
increase in pests that acted as carriers of viruses, says Mr Francisco
Morales, head of the virology unit at the Colombia-based International
Centre for Tropical Agriculture. 'As a result, bean production in Chile is
increasingly affected by epidemics of new viruses or strains of viruses,
such as bean yellow mosaic virus, and alfalfa mosaic virus.'
In 1970 Brazil grew soyabeans on 1.4m hectares of land; by 1988 the crop
covered 10.5m ha. 'The boom in soyabean cultivation coincided with one of
the worst virus epidemics that Latin American agriculture has ever suffered
 -golden mosaic disease, caused by a virus transmitted by the whitefly,'
says Mr Morales.
The big increase in the whitefly pest 'is directly related to the abundance
of soyabean', he points out. The pest has seriously affected traditional
bean-growing areas. Consumption of beans by Brazilians is today little more
than half its 1981 average of 28kg per person.
Mexico and other Central American countries have sharply increased their
exports of vegetables, especially tomatoes. 'The expansion of vegetable
crops in these countries has resulted in the appearance of new virus
problems,' says Mr Morales. In some tomato-growing areas, pests have
increased beyond control, causing major epidemics.
'The farmers grow export crops but are often not sure how to do it,' he
points out. 'When the market price is high for the export crops some are
earning more money than from beans alone. But the international market
demands fruit and vegetables with no blemishes and farmers use incredible
amounts of pesticide, which eats into their profits.'
Most of these pesticides are not approved for use on the crops the farmers
are growing, Mr Morales alleges, and they often do not have the knowledge to
apply them correctly. They apply them at the wrong times, including right up
to the harvest and frequently over-use them. 'Dependence on chemical
pesticides has become almost total,' he points out.
Some ten years ago, about 90 per cent of the money that Latin American
countries spent on agriculture research went on food crops, especially
beans, which contribute about 30 per cent of the protein consumed by the
continent's 200m low income families.
There has now been a total change: only about 20 per cent is devoted to food
crops while goes on export crops. In some countries, research into food
crops has been completely abandoned.
'Governments are more interested in how they use land for export crops, and
scientists are being switched to work on these crops,' says Pastor Corrales,
a plant pathologist.
Beans are the chief victim of this trend. Land that once grew beans now
grows vegetables for export. As a result, farmers are often growing just
enough beans for themselves, but none for the market. In towns and cities
beans are often scarce.
Every Latin American country apart from Argentina, Chile and Ecuador has
become a net importer of beans, with some countries importing them from
China.
With the US likely to tighten still further its regulations on pesticide
residues in food crops, Latin American farmers will either have to apply
less pesticide to their export crops or return to growing food crops.
And while US port officials can block the produce, they cannot stop the
winds. Mr Morales points out that tomato viruses, which have recently
emerged in the Caribbean, are now being seen in Florida - 'probably blown
there by the winds'.

FT  15 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Opec ministers see no need to
discuss output
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   VIENNA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Oil ministers from the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries meet in
Vienna today for talks that promise to be at least relaxed, if not amicable.
Delegates, including Mr Hisham Nazer, the Saudi oil minister, said last
night that there was no need to discuss output quotas or prices.
A sharp rise in oil prices over the past three months has taken much
pressure off the ministers, who are not expected to tamper with last March's
decision to set the Opec production ceiling at 24.52m barrels day for the
remainder of the year.
Iran has recently signalled its desire to see Opec add to the momentum of
recent price increases, which have taken the Benchmark Brent Blend from a
low of about Dollars 13 a barrel in February to its present level of Dollars
16.50. But analysts suggest that Opec could send a strong signal to the
markets by simply cancelling its next informal meeting in September.
Saudi Arabia, the cartel's biggest producer, says it sees no need for
another meeting before November, when the organisation must hold a formal
conference.
Traders say a cancellation would be interpreted as confirmation that Opec
was determined to stick to the present ceiling, even if international oil
demand rose further as a result of more robust economic activity in the
industrialised countries.
Opec has recently revised upwards its estimate of 1994 demand for its oil,
to an average of 24.8m barrels a day, up 40,000 b/d from last month's
forecast.
The committee that oversees Opec output yesterday expressed satisfaction
that member states were generally adhering to their quotas. The report said
estimates from selective secondary sources indicated production for May at
24.87m barrels a day. That is about 250,000 barrels higher than the revised
April average of 24.65m.
The main issue on Opec's agenda is the election of a new secretary general
to replace the outgoing Dr Subroto of Indonesia.
Dr Subroto yesterday said that he would be prepared to extend his term if,
as seems likely, delegates failed to reach unanimous agreement on a
replacement. But he said he would not be interested in serving for just a
few more months, preferring instead to extend his term for at least a year.

FT  15 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Australian winter crop
plantings expected to rise by 6%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT

<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Despite the recent lack of rain, Australian farmers are expected to increase
total winter crop planting by about 6 per cent, to 16.7m hectares. However,
rising wool prices and the reduction in sheep numbers in recent years are
likely to slow the switch into cropping and the expansion of grain-growing
areas after this season.
The forecast was made by the government-owned Australian Bureau of
Agriculture and Resource Economics yesterday. It also reported that there
has been a late start to the current cropping season but said that recent
rains had improved the situation in Western Australia, South Australia and
Victoria. It noted that there was an continuing problem in Queensland -
parts of which are suffering from severe drought - and parts of New South
Wales. Crops most at risk from the late start, it suggested, were chickpeas,
canola and lupins.
Abare said it expected the total wheat area to increase to about 10.2m ha,
compared with 9.5m last season. This assumes that the area sown to wheat in
Queensland increases by over 70 per cent to about 1m hectares. The bureau
admitted, however, that 'good follow-up rains will be required before this
forecast can be realised'.
It added that, with the 1993-94 cotton harvest almost completed, it expected
lint production to fall by some 17 per cent to 311,000 tonnes because of
'dry conditions and irrigation water shortages during the growing season.

Metall Mining, the international mining arm of Germany's Metallgesellschaft,
has decided to develop the Troilus gold deposit in north-west Quebec.
The mine, with a capital cost of about CDollars 150m, will start production
in the third quarter of 1996, at the earliest. The development is subject to
various regulatory permits and financing. Metall has also asked for
government help in providing infrastructure.
Output is expected to average 138,000 troy ounces of gold a year over 14
years at a cash cost of USDollars 222 an ounce. Mineable reserves are
estimated at 49.2m tonnes of gold-bearing ore with a grade of 1.34 grams a
tonne, as well as 1.29 grams a tonne of silver and 0.11 per cent copper.
Metall said that an environmental review of the project was 'well advanced'.

FT  15 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Aluminium takes up LME
pace-making
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The aluminium market picked up the baton at the London Metal Exchange
yesterday as copper's surge faltered in the face of strong resistance.
The white metal chalked up its ninth rise in a row, with the three months
position shrugging off news of a further rise in LME stocks, to reach a peak
of Dollars 1,447 a tonne, the highest level for three years.
It was trimmed back by profit-taking to Dollars 1,442.25 at the close, up
Dollars 15 on the day, and drifted further in after hours trading to Dollars
1,436. But dealers were still looking for more gains and some suggested that
a breach of resistance at Dollars 1,450 could herald an assault on the
Dollars 1,500 level.
'The fundamentals are recovering with stockpiles gradually decreasing, while
demand for cars and construction is also showing signs of picking up,' Mr
Yasuo Tanaka, senior account executive of the LME dealing team at Rudolf
Wolff in Tokyo, told the Reuters news agency.
Mr David Coutts, executive director of Australia's Aluminium Development
Council, was more cautious. He said in Sydney that the recent voluntary
production cuts made in the world's six major producing states to counteract
over-supply had been factored into the current price. 'The price improvement
has been justified until now but unless something else happens the market
could react again with a negative price impact,' he warned.
In early trading the copper market had looked set to build substantially on
Monday's break above Dollars 2,400 a tonne as the three months price quickly
climbed to Dollars 2,440. But that appeared to be the signal for a
long-awaited bout of profit-taking, and by the close the price was back at
Dollars 2,409.50, down Dollars 2. The reversal continued after hours, taking
the market down another Dollars 20.
But traders were not disheartened. 'Copper was due for a bit of a
shake-out,' one told Reuters. 'The market will be healthier for this.'
At the London Commodity Exchange coffee futures continued their surge
towards last month's five year highs as deepening supply fears encouraged
buyers and kept sellers away. The September position closed at Dollars 2,396
a tonne, adding Dollars 108 to Monday's Dollars 140 rise, after touching
Dollars 2,412 at one time.

FT  15 JUN 94 / Government Bonds: Treasuries improve after better inflation
news
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY and CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US Treasury bonds improved yesterday after the day's economic news relieved
the market's lingering concerns over monetary policy.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  7/16 higher
at 87 7/32 , with the yield slipping to 7.309 per cent. The two-year note
was  1/8 better at 100 5/32 , to yield 5.771 per cent.
Bonds made a moderate move higher in early trading after the Labour
Department reported that consumer prices in May had risen by a benign 0.2
per cent. When the more volatile food and energy sectors were excluded, core
CPI came in a 0.3 per cent. Both figures matched the consensus forecast of
economists.
The data eased concern that inflation might have begun to climb. Such
misgivings resurfaced last Friday, when the core producer price index
slightly exceeded expectations.
Yesterday the positive sentiment was reinforced by news of a 0.2 per cent
decline in May retail sales. Analysts had projected no change in the
reading.
As a result, bonds consolidated their gains. In the afternoon, however,
profit-takers moved in when Johnson Redbook reported a solid upturn in
retail sales in the first two weeks of June.
European government bonds had another roller-coaster day, falling sharply in
the morning and rallying in the afternoon to close little changed.
The early sell-off was largely due to technical selling in the futures
market and nervousness ahead of US inflation and retail sales data. When
these turned out better than expected, US Treasuries rose, pulling European
bonds higher.
Despite sterling's weakness, UK gilts put in a strong performance, buoyed in
the afternoon by the better US trend. However, most of the action was
reported to have taken place in the futures market. 'Most investors think
the market's cheap but aren't willing to commit any money to it,' said one
dealer.
Most traders today will be watching a barrage of data, including May retail
prices, May unemployment and April average earnings data.
'The average earnings will be the most closely watched after strong numbers
in the last few months,' said Mr Ian Shepherdson, UK economist at HSBC
Greenwell. If average earnings come in at 4 1/2 per cent 'gilts will have
another horrible day,' he said. The consensus forecast is for a 4 per cent
rise in average earnings.
Traders will also be looking to chancellor Kenneth Clarke's Mansion House
speech tonight.
German bonds fell sharply in the morning in futures-driven trading and
bounced back after the US data. Weak April retail sales numbers had little
impact on bunds. 'The market has still not refocused on fundamentals, which
are being overridden by technical and external factors,' said Mr Torsten
Bohler, senior bond analyst at UBS.
In Austria, the government cancelled a planned auction of a five-year bond
which was to have totalled Sch10bn, triggering a spurt of short-covering in
the five-year area.
Dutch bonds tracked German bunds despite the Dutch central bank's 10 basis
point cut in its special advances rate to 4.90 per cent. 'The cut was
largely a technical adjustment on the back of guilder strength,' said Mr
Bohler.
Despite the Swedish central bank's three basis point cut in its repo rate to
6.92 per cent, Swedish bonds plunged in the morning on heavy foreign
selling, which also pressured the currency, before recouping most of the
losses.
While many analysts now see value in the market, 'with the political
uncertainty ahead of the September election and the November EU referendum,
and the economic risks associated with the strengthening recovery, we see
the risk of further yield curve steepening in the months ahead,' warned Mr
Graham McDevitt, bond strategist at market analysts IDEA.
In Finland, market participants are eyeing today's vote of confidence for
Prime Minister Esko Aho's government, which, he warned yesterday, would
resign unless it received sufficient assurance of political support for its
handling of the EU membership process.
Italian bonds were dragged off their lows by the recovery in other markets,
but further advances are expected to be capped by today's issuance of new
10-year bonds and continued uncertainty about the size of the budget
deficit.

FT  15 JUN 94 / International Bonds: Global offerings in pipeline for US
mortgage agencies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bank Nederlandse Gemeenten (BNG), the Dutch municipal finance bank, plans to
take advantage of its newly-assigned debt ratings to launch a series of
benchmark international bonds. Yesterday, Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's both
officially rated the bank's debt triple-A.
Global offerings for two leading US mortgage agencies are also in the
pipeline. The Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) has
followed the lead of the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie
Mac), which last week announced plans to launch its first global offering
via Salomon Brothers and Goldman Sachs.
Fannie Mae has mandated Merrill Lynch and JP Morgan to arrange its offering,
which could emerge as early as next week. Both offerings are expected to
total around Dollars 1bn.
Fannie Mae's 10-year US domestic bonds currently trade at a spread of about
28 basis points over the comparable Treasury yield, but a global bond would
be priced more tightly. The maturity of the global bond has not yet been
decided.
In addition, Belgium is considering a Dollars 500m bond offering, which
could emerge today, though a maturity is yet to be decided.
BNG plans to launch a series of benchmark issues in D-Marks, yen and
dollars, according to Mr Jakob Hekkelman, a member of the bank's executive
board.
Goldman Sachs, which acted as financial adviser to BNG on its rating, has
been mandated to arrange the first benchmark issue.
The decision to seek a rating was sparked by the expansion of the bank's
international borrowing. 'We are becoming increasingly active in the
international capital markets,' said Mr Hekkelman. 'It's better to have
explicit ratings,' rather than constantly to explain to potential investors
the bank's close relationship to the Dutch government. BNG is 50 per
cent-owned by the government and 50 per cent by Dutch municipalities and
provinces.
Already, BNG is one of the largest Dutch borrowers in the international
markets. Last year, it raised Fl 5.3bn equivalent in the international
market, and Fl 10bn in the domestic market. Mr Hekkelman said increasing
demand from local government clients will mean a further expansion of its
financing activities. The bank will host a series of roadshows in Europe and
Asia.
Among yesterday's new issues, Household Revolving Home Equity Loan Trust
issued Dollars 731m of floating-rate securities backed by first and second
mortgages. Lead manager Merrill Lynch said that around a third of the
offering will be placed in Europe.
In the D-Mark sector, Argentina launched a DM500m three-year issue priced to
yield 220 basis points over the comparable bund. The deal was largely
targeted at retail investors, according to lead manager Deutsche Bank.

FT  15 JUN 94 / International Capital Markets: Chicago heads for regulatory
clash
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chicago's two big futures exchanges and their primary regulator, the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission, are heading for a showdown over how
strictly customer protection rules should be enforced just as the exchanges,
and the derivatives industry in general, are attracting a broad range of new
customers and large blocks of business.
The outcome of the dispute may determine whether the CFTC, which has a
reputation as a 'soft-glove' regulator, will be able to function effectively
as the main derivatives watchdog in the US, or whether it will be hamstrung
by the derivative industry's considerable voice in Congress.
The test for the agency comes as its newly-nominated chairman, Ms Mary
Schapiro, awaits confirmation on Capitol Hill, and within weeks of the start
of Congressional debates on the CFTC's reauthorisation. The CFTC's current
mandate expires in October.
At issue is the Commission's enforcement of fraud prevention measures
mandated in 1989, when the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board
of Trade were under federal investigation for corrupt trading floor
practices.
Investigators found weak controls, non-competitive order execution and
manipulation of the price and timing of trades.
The CFTC responded by ordering the exchanges to audit trades more closely,
and Congress, in reauthorising the CFTC in 1992, directed the Commission to
enforce tighter audit by October 1993. Congress, through the CFTC, also
ordered the exchanges to have in force a modern - and transparent -
trade-tracking system by 1995.
In spite of the mandates, the exchanges have done little since 1989 to
upgrade their existing trade-tracking systems.
Instead, they have invested some Dollars 12m in developing a high-tech
electronic 'notebook' to be used by traders and brokers to record
transactions.
The system, dubbed Audit, aims not only to meet the more stringent 1995
trade tracking requirements, but also provide a variety of pit accounting
services to brokers.
Exchange officials admit that if their goal for the Audit project was simply
to create a fool-proof audit trail, it could have been completed quickly and
cheaply by 1991. However, by going for a full-service device, they have used
technology to successfully delay interim CFTC sanctions.
In a review of the CBoT's trade-tracking system last year, for example, the
CFTC found it had generated few investigations that resulted in referrals to
exchange disciplinary committees, and that the exchange had ignored previous
Commission suggestions for upgrading the system.
However, the Commission excused the shortcomings, noting the CBoT's
commitment to the Audit project, which at that time was due to be
implemented in 1995.
In a surprise twist last week, however, the exchanges told Congress and the
CFTC that they needed another four years to develop Audit.
Rather than risk CFTC sanctions for missing the 1995 deadline, the exchanges
persuaded an Illinois Congressman to introduce a House Appropriations
proceeding that would force the CFTC to extend the trade-tracking deadline
to 1999 or risk losing its funding.

FT  15 JUN 94 / International Company News: Unlikely allies make a
connection - FT writers look at yesterday's three-way global telecoms
link-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON, MICHAEL LINDEMANN and JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Few of the world's larger telecommunications operators are more dissimilar
than Sprint and the French and German state companies.
France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom are state-owned national monopolies.
Sprint, with revenues barely a third as large as its new German partner, has
fought former monopolists every day of its life, in the process building an
impressive international portfolio.
Yet for all three companies, yesterday's alliance was the answer to a
similar problem: how to become a serious challenger in the emerging market
for one-stop international telecoms services.
For France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom, the deal satisfies a long-held
desire to find a US partner to strengthen their international expansion and
their position in the large corporate sector ahead of the liberalisation of
the European telecommunications market in 1998. Sprint's existing client
base among multinationals, its modern data network and its brand name are
seen as valuable assets.
The French and German operators signed an Ecu1bn (Dollars 862m) alliance
last December to strengthen their existing 'Eunetcom' joint venture to
provide corporate services. A US deal was the next vital step.
However, for both European companies it is far from the last step.
Yesterday, Mr Marcel Roulet, chairman of France Telecom, spoke of extending
the agreement to include new partners in the Asia-Pacific region. Although
he declined to mention the potential partners, NTT, the largest Japanese
operator, is a possibility.
Mr Roulet was at pains to stress that the Sprint deal was consistent with
his company's existing investment plans, and could be financed through
cashflow or borrowings. Neither, he said, would it undermine France
Telecom's policy of reducing its financial charges. The aim is to cut
financial charges to 3 per cent of sales by 1998, compared with the current
level of just under 7 per cent.
France Telecom's status as an 'autonomous operator under public law' has
ruled out the exchange of shares to seal alliances. Last year, the French
government announced plans to convert the operator into a state-owned joint
stock company. But strong opposition from its 155,000 employees forced a
retreat.
Mr Roulet is trying to persuade his staff of the need for reform. However,
privatisation remains a distant prospect. So too, therefore, is the prospect
of a cross-shareholding with Sprint.
Yesterday's deal, then, seems unlikely to accelerate France Telecom's entry
into the private sector. Mr Roulet and Mr Helmut Ricke, his German
counterpart, also played down the prospect of a more rapid liberalisation of
the Franco-German voice telecommunications market as a condition for
regulatory approval.
Deutsche Telekom has already been expanding rapidly eastwards. Last year, it
took a 30 per cent stake in Matav, the Hungarian state-owned
telecommunications group, which it bought with Ameritech of the US for
Dollars 875m. It also has a stake in Astra, the international satellite
television company, and a share in mobile and fixed networks in Russia and
Ukraine. The operator also has EU ambitions: it has just joined the Spanish
Cometa consortium bidding for a mobile telephone licence in Spain.
However, Deutsche Telekom's internal problems are just as pressing as those
of its French partner. It is in tough talks with the postal union which may
threaten the next stage of privatisation, the creation of a joint stock
company by January 1 1995.
Mr Ricke said the company would 'have considerable difficulties' finding the
DM1.75bn (Dollars 1.1bn) it needs to finance the purchase of an 11.1 per
cent stake in Sprint, the first tranche of a two-stage operation to give the
French and German companies 20 per cent of Sprint. The money had, however,
been set aside in the company's medium-term financial plan. 'Even if it
(privatisation) does fail, this project will be safeguarded,' said Mr Ricke.
Unless Mr Helmut Kohl's centre-right coalition can persuade the opposition
Social Democrats to vote in favour of privatisation before June 29, it will
be impossible to meet the existing privatisation deadline, since
privatisation requires a two-thirds parliamentary majority to be approved.
That may not overturn the Sprint deal, but it will make its extension
problematic.
For Sprint, the European alliance offers added credibility and financial
muscle, as it tries to attract business from multi-national companies in the
fast-growing global market. Sprint is the smallest of America's three
long-distance telecommunications groups, with a market share of around 9.5
per cent compared with the 19 per cent held by MCI and some 60 per cent by
AT&amp;T.
A tie-up with France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom links it with the dominant
carriers in two countries which contain some 14 per cent of the world's
multinationals. With a further 29 per cent located in the US, that gives the
alliance a potential market of nearly 50 per cent of the world's leading
companies before it starts the harder task of winning business in other
countries.
Sprint already has a substantial presence in the international market for
corporate data traffic through SprintNet, one of the world's leading leading
data networks. SprintNet's operations outside the US will be injected into
the global partnership with the French and Germans.
Mr Bill Esrey, Sprint's chairman, yesterday highlighted two probable uses
for the Dollars 4bn of new equity Sprint is raising. Some will be earmarked
to pay down debt. Sprint also plans to use the money on new investments,
notably a planned alliance with other US wireless service providers to
create a seamless national mobile telephone network.
As part of this scheme, Sprint plans to bid for US licences for a new system
of mobile telephony - personal communications services (PCS) - being
auctioned at the end of this year.

FT  15 JUN 94 / International Company News: Franco-German pact defies
sceptics - FT writers look at yesterday's three-way global telecoms link-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last autumn the French and German state telecommunications companies were in
talks about a union extending to a full merger of their international
activities, and the possibility of an equity swap. In the event they
produced a far more modest joint venture.
Six months later, the sceptics warned that the talks between the
Franco-German alliance and Sprint, the third-largest US long-distance
carrier, would end the same way. The state-owned European monopolies had
enough problems forging their own alliance: subsequent talks with AT&amp;T, the
large US group, came to nothing: and the challenge in linking with any
operator in the highly competitive US market seemed Herculean.
Yesterday was no time for sceptics. France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom went
the whole way, spending Dollars 4.2bn on a stake in Sprint and mapping out a
structure promising that the new alliance would serve the world. Mr Helmut
Ricke, Deutsche Telekom's chairman, called Sprint 'the ideal partner' for
implementing his global strategic goals.
The Franco-German-Sprint deal mirrors last year's alliance between British
Telecommunications and MCI of the US. The amount of cash involved is roughly
similar; in both cases it is flowing from Europe to the US; and the goal
proclaimed for the international alliances - to exploit the large corporate
market for one-stop international telecoms services - is identical.
A third alliance may be in the offing - between AT&amp;T and Unisource, a joint
venture between the Swedish, Swiss and Dutch national operators. If the
talks between the two yield another US-European tie-up, the financial
arrangements are likely to be different to the other two: but the rationale
and objectives will be the same.
However, the parallel between the BT/MCI and Sprint/Franco-German deals
should not be pressed too far. The alliance announced yesterday is between
three, not two companies, and bears all the hallmarks of complex tripartite
haggling. While BT and MCI are to establish one joint venture company to
spearhead their joint efforts, Sprint and its partners are promising at
least three separate entities, with a variable balance between the three.
The regulatory barriers are also likely to be far higher for Sprint, France
Telecom and Deutsche Telekom than they were for BT-MCI. It has taken the
latter a year to get approval from US authorities, in spite of the fact that
the UK is arguably a more competitive telecommunications market than the US.
France and Germany, by contrast, remain monopolies for voice and leased-line
business - the most lucrative parts of the telecoms business. Neither the
French nor the German operators will face 'voice' competition in their home
markets until 1998, and given Mercury's experience in the UK it may take
years for competition to become a reality.
Within minutes of the announcement of yesterday's deal, AT&amp;T was vowing to
fight it strenuously through the US Federal Communications Commission and
other forums. US analysts believe it stands some chance of success.
The French and Germans claim that the alliance will provide services only in
sectors - notably data telecoms and private corporate networks  - already
open to competition in their home markets. Nonetheless, claims and
counter-claims as to the cross-subsidies being provided from monopoly
revenues look set to preoccupy regulators, possibly for years.
The spotlight is now firmly on AT&amp;T, whose European strategy has been
difficult to discern since BT announced its purchase of 20 per cent of MCI
last June. AT&amp;T has to decide whether to work with established European
operators, or to compete aggressively against them as and when it can.
An alliance with Unisource may offer it the best of both worlds - taking it
into Europe in respectable domestic company, but leaving it free to compete
head-on with the EU's larger operators, which control most of the telecoms
business of Europe's multinationals.

FT  15 JUN 94 / International Company News: New World lures Tartikoff to top
television production post
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Mr Brandon Tartikoff, who has a reputation as one of the most talented US
entertainment industry executives, was named yesterday to the top production
post at New World Communications - the media group which shocked the
television business last month when its stations switched affiliation to the
upstart Fox network owned by Mr Rupert Murdoch.
The move is a considerable coup for New World, a media group which forms
part of the empire of Mr Ronald Perelman, the New York investor and head of
the Revlon cosmetics group.
New World owns television stations but is also keen to build up its film
production business, called New World Entertainment, which has produced
several hit television series.
Mr Tartikoff rose to prominence at the NBC television network, where he was
chairman of the entertainment group and helped the network to six
consecutive seasons as number one in prime time.
He left there to head Paramount Pictures, the Hollywood film studio, but
resigned abruptly in 1992 to spend more time with his daughter, who had been
injured in a car accident.
Since April last year he has been president of Moving Target Productions,
his independent production company, which is to be acquired by New World.
As part of last month's deal, Fox agreed to invest Dollars 500m in New World
and work with it to develop syndicated programming, as well as prime time
series and movies for Fox.
Mr Perelman and Mr Bill Bevins, chief executive of New World, approached Mr
Tartikoff about the job after forming their alliance with Fox.
Mr Tartikoff said he had been impressed by the vision they shared of the
changing television world, their financial resources, and their access to 40
per cent of US homes through the Fox deal.

FT  15 JUN 94 / International Company News: Hard slog up the bad-debt
mountain - Japan's banks claim the worst is over but details suggest
otherwise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD BAKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last month, Japan's banks unveiled their annual results with confident
boasts that the worst of the country's bad-debt crisis had past. They
congratulated themselves on having disposed of more non-performing loans
than they had ever written off before.
The figures seemed to support claims that the total of bad debts had peaked.
At the 11 leading city banks, outstanding disclosed problem loans fell by
more than 3 per cent from September 1993 to the end of March, down to less
than 4 per cent of total loans. Most banks spoke boldly of eliminating
problem loans within two years.
But, on closer inspection, the details suggest the bad debt mountain is a
long way from being scaled. Most of the apparent improvement in the banks'
performance stems from their disposal of loans to the Co-operative Credit
Purchasing Corporation (CCPC), a body set up last year specifically to take
over the worst of the bad debts - and the writing-off of loans to that body
is not quite what it seems.
As an exercise in financial alchemy, the CCPC could not have been bettered.
Banks would turn the base metal of their non-performing loans into gold of a
sort by selling them to the CCPC at a discount to their full asset value,
and book the difference as a loss against their earnings.
The value of the loans parked with the CCPC would then be a real, though
slightly diminished asset. The CCPC would dispose of the loans, most of them
property-related, and collect the collateral.
But this alchemy is, in practice, little better than its medieval
forerunner. The catch is that the banks have to lend the money to the CCPC
in the first place to enable it to buy the loans. The risk of default
remains with the bank. If the CCPC is unable to recover what it paid for the
loans, the difference is met by the banks.
As Mr David Snoddy, banking analyst at Jardine Flemimg in Tokyo, says: 'The
CCPC is principally a repricing mechanism, designed to reduce the market's
perception of bankruptcy risk in Japan's banks.'
If the CCPC were getting rid of the vast numbers of loans it has purchased
from the banks at book value, of course, there would be little to worry
about.
But the latest figures from the corporation, published this week, show that
it continues to pile up the base metal, without any real sign of the gold.
The banks have been dumping vast quantities of loans on the CCPC. So far it
has managed to dispose of just over 1 per cent of them.
The failure of the CCPC to liquidate the loans may soon create a problem for
the operation of the system itself.
Under ministry of finance rules, banks are forbidden from lending more than
20 per cent of their primary capital base to any one lender. Some banks have
been so busy passing on loans to the CCPC that they are in danger of
breaching that constraint.
The finance ministry yesterday denied that there was any immediate threat,
but the figures speak for themselves. Banks' primary capital ratios stand at
an average of about 5 to 6 per cent.
They are attempting to dispose of around 5 per cent of their total loan book
as bad loans.
That means that only one-fifth of the loans would have to be passed to the
CCPC before they started to hit the capital adequacy constraint.
It is unlikely that such a situation would provoke a crisis. Before the
ratios are breached, the ministry is likely to step in with a solution.
One possibility is a 'Son of CCPC', enabling the banks to go on lending in
the same way to another, identical institution. In such a way, a whole
family of CCPCs could be spawned as the number of loans piles up.
The CCPC does have benefits for the banks. But even these have been
overstated.
Its principal advantage is tax. Normally, banks have to negotiate with the
finance ministry on every loan for which they wish to receive approval to
post tax-free reserves. The CCPC allows them to receive the tax relief
automatic-ally.
But, as Mr David Threagold, of BZW in Tokyo, points out, this is not such a
huge benefit. 'The banks would still eventually receive the relief on the
bad loans once they were finally confirmed as non-performing,' he says. 'All
the CCPC allows them to do is to receive the relief immediately.'
All this leaves the bank's bad debt problems where they have been for some
time. And behind the official figures there are darker problems.
The CCPC deals only with loans meant for liquidation. Later this year, the
banking authorities will announce new plans for dealing with the vast
numbers of loans that do not even currently appear as non-performing - loans
that have been 'restructured', where interest rates have been pared to the
bone to keep borrowers afloat.
Ms Alicia Ogawa, banking analyst at Salomon Brothers in Tokyo, estimates
that, counting the bulk of the CCPC loans as non-performing, and adding in
the undisclosed restructured loans, total problem loans at all Japan's
largest banks grew by at least 15 per cent last year.
As the pace of economic recovery threatens to be slow, the truth for most
banks is that they are still some way from the summit of their bad debt
mountain. The next few years promise them a hard slog to the top.

FT  15 JUN 94 / International Company News: Poor trend continues as Heinz
sales volume slips
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
HJ Heinz yesterday said sales slumped in the final three months of its
fiscal year to April 2, as the US food group continued a string of
disappointing performances. The company, headed by Mr Tony O'Reilly, the
Irish businessman, also showed a sharp decline in underlying earnings.
The 4 per cent downturn in revenues to Dollars 1.95bn, compared with Dollars
2.03bn in the same quarter last year, reflected operational difficulties and
unfavourable trading conditions.
Heinz's strong presence in overseas markets heightened the impact of
negative currency fluctuations. More troublesome, however, was a 4 per cent
deterioration in sales volume, after two consecutive quarterly gains.
The decline in the three months partly stemmed from a failure to revive its
Weight Watchers businesses during the January and February period.
However, Heinz's food-service business recorded higher sales volume for the
quarter and the company raised prices on most of its core products.
Nevertheless, at the operating level earnings of Dollars 200.3m represented
a big decline from the previous year, if a Dollars 192m restructuring charge
is added back to the 1993 results. With the provision held out, Heinz earned
Dollars 54.3m a year ago at the operating level.
The comparison would have been even more unflattering if the company had not
reduced selling, general and administrative expenses by more than 7 per cent
from the year-earlier quarter.
Net income amounted to Dollars 129m, or 51 cents, against Dollars 69m, or 27
cents, a year earlier. However, the restructuring charge reduced the 1993
result by 43 cents a share.
Net income was Dollars 602.9m, or Dollars 2.35, including gains of 24 cents
on disposals, against earnings of Dollars 396.3m, or Dollars 1.53, including
a provision of 45 cents for restructuring and a charge of 51 cents to
reflect accounting changes.

<TEXT>
Two of Mexico's largest financial groups, Grupo Financiero Serfin and Grupo
Financiero Inverlat, plan to merge in a move that will create the country's
second-largest bank.
The merger plan, approved by shareholders yesterday, will begin a process of
full integration between the two groups, which control the Serfin and
Comermex banks.
The new institution will have assets of about Dollars 36bn, placing it just
above the current second-placed bank, Bancomer and behind the largest,
Banamex.
The two groups will also fuse their brokerage houses and factoring
companies, creating the largest Mexican institutions in those two areas with
assets of Dollars 14.3bn and Dollars 1.1bn respectively.
Under the terms of the merger, Serfin will carry out a capital increase and
there would then be an exchange of shares with Inverlat shareholders. No
further details were given. The holding company for the new institution
would be controlled largely by Serfin, analysts said.
The merger will also bring together two of the country's most strong-willed
financiers, Mr Adrian Sada, the Monterrey-based businessman who is chairman
of Serfin, and Mr Augustin Legorreta, chairman of Inverlat.
It has yet to be decided who will be chairman of the new group.

General Motors New Zealand, a unit of the US carmaker, recorded its best
financial result for six years in the 1993 calendar year, reporting an
after-tax profit of NZDollars 2.5m (USDollars 1.5m) compared with a loss of
NZDollars 800,000 in the previous 12 months, Reuter reports from Wellington.
Mr Don Bowden, managing director, said the result reflected for the first
time the full impact of cost-reduction initiatives implemented during 1992.
Profit before tax was NZDollars 5.8m, a Dollars 7m rise over the previous
year.
Mr Bowden said: 'It was achieved in a market that offered little in the way
of growth and that was marked by fierce competitive activity at the retail
end of the business.'
He said the result vindicated the company's strategic direction in recent
years, with a switch in focus from new vehicle assembly and distribution to
sales and marketing.

<TEXT>
The Treuhand privatisation agency yesterday held negotiations with the East
German Investment Trust (Egit) in an attempt to clarify the extent of the
London-based fund's investment commitments in companies it bought from the
agency in 1992.
Egit, which pledged to invest more than DM1.5bn (Dollars 909,000) over the
next three years in companies whose workforces total 7,000, is apparently
having second thoughts about acquiring a stake in Forun, the eastern German
refrigerator company. Forun was one of the first to manufacture a product
free of CFC gases, which have been criticised on environmental grounds.
Mr Eberhard Gunther, manager of Forun, said Egit had signed a contract in
November 1992 to acquire 47 per cent of the company. 'But Egit has not
invested one DM in the company,' said Mr Gunther, adding that Forun was in
desperate need of capital in order to face growing competition.
According to Forun, under the terms of the contract with the Treuhand, Egit
had agreed to invest DM11.5m in the company over a four-year period, as well
as guarantee 800 jobs. Forun had a turnover of DM120m last year, and is
carrying losses of DM12m.
Mr Olav zu Ermgassen, a board member of Egit, this week denied that the fund
had signed a contract for Forun, and instead sharply criticised the
Treuhand.
'It is the Treuhand's fault,' said Mr Ermgassen. 'We had the option to
acquire a 47 per cent stake in Forun. We have been negotiating the terms of
this contract with the agency since November 1992. But we have been passed
from one negotiating team to the next. The Treuhand did not stick to the
original terms.'
When it was set up in 1992, Egit's board of directors included Mr Colin
Black, chairman of Scottish Widows' Fund, and Sir Christopher Tugendhat,
chairman of Abbey National.

Forestry Corporation of New Zealand is optimistic that the recent lifting of
a ban on logging the Pacific north-west forests will not have an adverse
effect on profits, Reuter reports from Wellington.
Mr Tim Cullinane, chief executive, said yesterday: 'It is by no means
certain that the changes that have taken place will in fact hold.
'I think we can expect the environmentalists will run another solid charge
through the courts system, and our intelligence is that there will not be
much of an increase in volumes coming onstream.'
He said he thought wood prices would hold steady for the rest of the year.
Forestry Corp earlier announced a net profit of NZDollars 157.1m (USDollars
92.5m) before payment to the government of a NZDollars 112m dividend. Gross
sales were NZDollars 454.2m.

Metra, the Finnish industrial group, yesterday reported profits after
financial items of FM65m (Dollars 11.8m) in the four months to the end of
April, down heavily from FM145m for the same period last year.
However, Metra, whose main operations cover diesel engines, sanitaryware and
security systems, said the figure was distorted by unusually large
deliveries by the Wartsila Diesel unit, its biggest division, in the first
four months of last year.
It predicted profits for the whole year would be ahead of 1993's FM472m, in
spite of the effects of the merger announced last week between its Abloy
Security division and the locks division of Sweden's Securitas.
The merger, the latest in a series of moves to narrow Metra's focus, will
create Europe's biggest maker of cylinder locks.
The surge in Wartsila deliveries early last year, combined with divestments,
also led to a decline in Metra's group sales in the first four months, to
FM3.4bn from FM4.2bn.

<TEXT>
Electronic Data Systems (EDS), the computer services company owned by
General Motors, has won a Dollars 3.2bn 10-year contract to take over
operation of Xerox's computer and telecommunications network worldwide.
The 'outsourcing' contract is believed to be the largest of its kind, and
the first to encompass the worldwide information management operations of
any company.
Under the arrangement, EDS will assume responsibility for Xerox
data-processing, telecommunications and computer network services in 19
countries, and provide and maintain the computer applications that support
Xerox's internal business processes.
It will take control of data centre operations, including the main ones in
the US, the UK and Brazil; worldwide voice and data communications; desktop
systems support; and existing business-support applications.
Xerox will retain responsibility for determining the architecture of its
computer systems, strategy and new program development. It will also
continue to service and support its customers.
Some 1,700 Xerox employees, including 1,400 in the US and 750 in the UK,
will transfer to EDS over the next 18 months.
Xerox has taken the unprecedented step of outsourcing almost all its
information management operations to 'focus resources on our core business
of document processing, which is critical to ensure our continued success in
a fiercely competitive industry', said Mr Paul Allaire, Xerox chairman. He
said the outsourcing arrangement would cut costs.
'This is the first truly global commercial information-management
outsourcing arrangement and provides an opportunity for EDS to showcase its
proven capabilities,' said Mr Les Alberthal, EDS chairman, president and
chief executive.
The Xerox contract follows EDS's recent Dollars 1.5bn order to handle
computer operations for the Inland Revenue, the UK tax authority.

Weaker sales of large paper machines led to deeper losses at Valmet, the
Finnish engineering group, in the first four months of this year.
The group, which recently raised FM671.3m (Dollars 122.3m) through an
international share offering, said its deficit after financial items
amounted to FM243m for the period, more than three times the previous year's
FM72m loss, and followed a 20 per cent drop in net sales, to FM2.65bn.
The group said several large paper machines were delivered in early 1993,
whereas most of this year's contracts would not be booked until the end of
the year.
Valmet warned that its full-year result would be affected by the
recently-completed FM1.62bn sale of its transport equipment and tractor
operations to Sisu-Auto.

FT  15 JUN 94 / International Company News: Upstart Cott shakes up cola
kings - The Toronto group is at war with Coke and Pepsi
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Walk into the Loblaws supermarket in Humbertown Plaza on the western
outskirts of Toronto and you are on the frontline of the global cola war.
Soft drink displays dominate two walls of the store, and it is quickly
apparent which brand Loblaws wants shoppers to buy. Most of the shelf space
is taken up by President's Choice (PC), Loblaws' own in-house brand.
A 750ml bottle of PC Cola sells for 49 cents, compared with 79 cents for
Coca-Cola or Pepsi. While a 24-can case of the two traditional brands costs
CDollars 6.99, President's Choice sells for just CDollars 4.99.
PC Cola is one of a growing array of private-label soft drinks made by Cott
Corporation, the upstart Toronto-based company which is giving Coke and
Pepsi - long viewed as two of the world's most invincible brands - their
stiffest competition for a long time.
The success of Cott and other private-label soft-drink makers led PepsiCo to
warn last week that its second-quarter earnings would be virtually flat.
Pepsi's share price has tumbled by 16 per cent on the New York Stock
Exchange in the past 10 days.
By contrast, Cott last week reported a 67 per cent jump in first-quarter
earnings, to CDollars 9.6m (USDollars 6.9m). Sales, at CDollars 217.5m, were
more than 66 per cent higher, and they included a 77 per cent surge in
revenues from the US. Analysts predict sales will surpass CDollars 1.2bn in
the year to January 1995, almost double last year's CDollars 665m.
Cott has signed supply agreements with 90 retail chains around the world.
They include Wal-Mart, the biggest US retailer, which markets Cott products
under the name Sam's American Choice.
Since the beginning of the year, the Canadian company has helped
supermarkets in the UK, France and Spain to launch private-label soft
drinks. It recently began shipments to Ito Yokado, Japan's second-biggest
retailer.
Cott's success is dramatically illustrated by the experience of J. Sainsbury
of the UK, which launched a Cott product under the name Sainsbury's Classic
Cola in April. Within four weeks, the cola had won a 60 per cent share of
Sainsbury sales, equal to a quarter of England's entire take-home cola
market.
Cott has several advantages over Coke and Pepsi:
Its marketing and advertising expenses pale in comparison. By providing
retailers with their own private-label brands, Cott has no need to spend
tens of millions of dollars promoting a national brand by sponsoring the US
National Football League (as Coke does), or hiring Michael Jackson and
basketball star Shaqille O'Neal for advertising campaigns (as Pepsi has).
Cott piggy-backs on retailers' centralised warehouse and distribution
facilities. The same supermarket trucks which carry produce from warehouses
to stores bring Cott soft drinks from the bottler back to the warehouse.
Until recently, the cost to bottlers of Cott concentrate was as little as
one-sixth of that for Coke or Pepsi.
Mr Mark Husson, analyst at J. P. Morgan in New York, concluded in a recent
report that 'private-brand retailers stand to make 15 per cent more profit
from a premium private-brand cola than they do from national brands'.
Nowhere has Cott scored bigger gains, or provoked a more powerful response
from Coke and Pepsi, than in its home market of Ontario. 'It's tweaked Coke
and Pepsi to re-examine their whole organisation,' says the soft drinks
category manager at one of Canada's biggest supermarket chains.
The products of Cott, disguised in retail chains' private-label packaging,
are on the shelves of almost every supermarket in the province. Even corner
stores carry them under the name RC Cola (short for Royal Crown Cola), for
which Cott has the Canadian bottling licence.
Private-label colas have captured more than half the business in the two
biggest supermarket groups, Loblaws and Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific (A&amp;P).
According to Cott, its products now command a 31 per cent share of the
entire Ontario cola market.
On the other hand, Coca-Cola's Canadian bottling subsidiary ran up losses of
almost CDollars 200m in 1992 and 1993. In a drive to improve
competitiveness, it has closed eight of its 16 production plants, and all
but six of the 68 administration offices.
Coca-Cola and PepsiCo have responded to Cott's challenge in Canada by
lowering prices and, more importantly, widening retailers' margins. The two
national brands used to be loss leaders for many supermarkets. Now,
according to an A&amp;P official, the margins on Coke, Pepsi and Cott colas are
roughly equal.
Competitive margins are not enough, however, to persuade retailers to push
Coke and Pepsi as hard as their private labels. According to Mr Husson:
'Successful retailers in the 1990s will be those understanding that they are
promoting a strong, differentiated supermarket brand, not merely serving as
passive landlords of shelf space.'
The A&amp;P official notes that soft drinks have played an indispensable role in
promoting the chain's entire range of Master Choice private-label products.
'It's the one item that has brought the name Master Choice to the
marketplace,' he says.
Not everyone, however, is convinced that Cott's long-term future is assured.
Some analysts have questioned its aggressive accounting practices. Its
chairman, Mr Gerald Pencer, is an entrepreneur whose last venture - a
Canadian trust and loan company - ended in failure.
Coke and Pepsi's increasingly aggressive response has also raised doubts
about whether Cott's spectacular growth of the past two to three years can
be sustained. Its margins have lately been squeezed in several key markets,
including Ontario.
Cott's first-quarter earnings may have been impressive, but they were less
impressive than many investors anticipated. PepsiCo and Coca-Cola can
console themselves that their new rival's share price has also fallen more
than 10 per cent in the past week.

RH Macy, the US retailer struggling to emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection, said it was encouraged by the steady improvement in its
underlying performance in the third quarter, writes Frank McGurty in New
York.
The department store chain, which is expected to submit a reorganisation
plan to a federal court at the end of this month, announced a 32 per cent
jump in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation to
Dollars 34.9m for the three months to the end of April, against Dollars
26.5m a year earlier. However, the net loss was Dollars 157.3m, or Dollars
97.28 a share, against a Dollars 227.9m deficit recorded in the year-earlier
quarter.
For the nine months, Macy posted a net loss of Dollars 217m, or Dollars
132.82 a share, against a shortfall of Dollars 354.9m, or Dollars 219.49, a
year earlier.

<TEXT>
Weaker sales of large paper machines led to deeper losses at Valmet, the
Finnish engineering group, in the first four months of this year.
The group, which recently raised FM671.3m (Dollars 122.3m) through an
international share offering, said its deficit after financial items
amounted to FM243m for the period.
This is more than three times the previous year's FM72m loss, and follows a
20 per cent drop in net sales, to FM2.65bn.
The group said several large paper machines were delivered in early 1993,
whereas most of this year's contracts would not be booked until the end of
the year.
Although it fell to an operating loss of FM140m from a FM80m profit, the
bottom line benefited from reduced net financing costs of FM103m, against
FM152m.
New orders amounted to FM2.45bn, taking the order backlog at April 30 to
FM6.15bn, or 3 per cent up on last year. The paper and board division
accounts for FM4.8bn of the backlog.
Valmet warned that its full-year result would be affected by the
recently-completed FM1.62bn sale of its transport equipment and tractor
operations to Sisu-Auto. The transfer will cut 1994 net sales by 20 per
cent, to around FM8.5bn, and reduce operating income from 1993's FM479m.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Esab, the world's leading producer of welding equipment, said yesterday
profits were rising faster than anticipated. It forecast income after
financial items for 1994 of around SKr300m (Dollars 38m), compared with
SKr82m last year.
The Swedish group said the improvement stemmed chiefly from cost-cutting and
restructuring within the European operations, where the number of employees
has fallen by 35 per cent since 1990.
Although the European market was said to be 'somewhat weaker' this year,
Esab said there was strong growth in North America and Asia.
Group sales in the first five months of the year rose modestly, to SKr3.1bn
from SKr2.8bn in the same period last year. However, profits after financial
items surged to SKr138m from SKr13m.
If market trends in Europe and North America continued, and there was no
adverse effect from currency reform in Brazil, an important market,
full-year profits should be three times the 1993 result.

   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Metra, the Finnish industrial group, yesterday reported profits after
financial items of FM65m (Dollars 11.8m) in the four months to the end of
April, a dramatic fall from the FM145m posted for the same period last year.
However, Metra, whose main operations cover diesel engines, sanitaryware and
security systems, said the figure was distorted by unusually large
deliveries by the Wartsila Diesel unit, its biggest division, in the first
four months of last year.
It predicted profits for the whole year would be ahead of 1993's FM472m, in
spite of the effects of the merger announced last week between Metra's Abloy
Security division and the locks division of Sweden's Securitas.
The merger, the latest in a series of moves to narrow Metra's focus, will
take effect later this year, creating Europe's biggest maker of cylinder
locks.
The surge in Wartsila deliveries early last year, combined with divestments,
also led to a decline in Metra's group sales in the first four months, to
FM3.4bn from FM4.2bn.
Sales for Wartsila, one the world's leading manufacturers of diesel power
generators, tumbled 35 per cent during the period, to FM1.6bn, and operating
profits fell heavily to FM19m.
However, Metra said the order book had grown steadily since January,
foreshadowing increased deliveries in the last four months of the year.
Wartsila sales in the full year were expected to remain around last year's
level of FM7bn, with profits down slightly on 1993's FM449m.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Metropolitan Life and Travelers, the US insurers, are combining their health
insurance businesses in a joint venture company, marking a further
consolidation in the US managed healthcare industry.
Together, the two provide health insurance to 13m people and have annual
premiums in this area of Dollars 17.6bn.
The companies hope to reduce unit costs and force bigger discounts from
healthcare providers, such as hospitals and drugs companies.
The deal marks the first steps taken by Mr Sanford Weill, whose Primerica
financial services group took over Travelers last year, to sort out some
parts of Travelers' underperforming insurance operations.
Earlier this year, Mr Weill predicted mergers in the insurance industry as
companies sought to make themselves more efficient.
Under a separate agreement yesterday, Travelers said it would sell its group
life insurance business to MetLife for Dollars 350m.
MetLife and Travelers have been slower than some other leading insurers to
develop managed care operations. These take various forms, but generally
involve a company setting up networks of doctors and hospitals and
negotiating discounts, rather than simply processing claims forms.
Only 391,000 of the 13m people insured by Travelers and MetLife are in
health maintenance organisations (HMOs), under which individuals are
serviced by a prescribed network of doctors and hospitals.
All US insurers are attempting to move people from fee-for-service plans
into HMOs, which have become a more profitable way of providing healthcare
cover.
HMOs are popular among US companies that pay their employees' health
insurance. Buying coverage for the average person in an HMO cost Dollars
3,520 last year, compared with Dollars 4,370 for traditional health
insurance.

FT  15 JUN 94 / International Company News: Sales at Fiat unit improve 13%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Net sales at Magneti Marelli, the Italian automotive components group which
is controlled by Fiat, rose 13 per cent in the first five months of this
year, compared with the same period of 1993.
Mr Luigi Francione, Magneti Marelli's chairman, told shareholders at their
annual meeting yesterday that turnover had increased to L1,473bn (Dollars
910m) between January and the end of May, in spite of the gloomy outlook for
European car production.
In 1993, net revenues rose only 1.9 per cent to L2,935bn, and the group
returned a net consolidated loss of L157.4bn after financial and
restructuring charges.
However, Magneti Marelli said that it had experienced 'notable increases' in
sales of fuel systems, engine control and temperature control units this
year.
'The growth in sales volume and the implementation of rationalisation,
foreseen and undertaken in 1993, has allowed (the company) to realise a
positive operating result and to break even before taxes,' the group said.
Yesterday's meeting granted the Magneti Marelli board a five-year authority
to increase capital by a maximum nominal value of L1,000bn and to issue
bonds for the same amount.
About 42 per cent of Magneti Marelli is owned directly by Fiat, and a
further 21.5 per cent by other group companies. In terms of sales it is the
fourth largest company in the Fiat stable.

trail

   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Carlo De Benedetti, the Italian financier, has relaunched Cofir, the
Madrid-based holding company controlled by his Cerus group in France, on the
Iberian takeover trail. It has acquisitions, secured and in the pipeline,
amounting to Pta9.5bn (Dollars 70m).
Mr De Benedetti told Cofir's annual meeting yesterday that it had last
Friday acquired the majority holding in Spain's leading city hotel group for
Pta6.5bn.
He said it was close to spending Pta3bn to buy a supermarket chain and it
planned to expand its wine division to become to the biggest producer of
Rioja table wine.
Twenty UK and US institutions control 25 per cent of the holding company's
share capital. Cerus owns 45 per cent of Cofir's equity and the rest is
traded on the Madrid stock market.
Mr De Benedetti said institutional backing for Cofir gave him 'great
satisfaction'. He defended the cautious investment policy of the past years
that had allowed Cofir to build up a liquidity of more than Pta20bn.
The decision to restart buying comes as fixed income investment becomes less
attractive due to falling interest rates and as cheaper properties come on
to the market.
The first move has been to increase a 49 per cent stake held by Cofir in NH
Hoteles, a group that owns and manages 60 hotels in Spain, to 70 per cent as
a prior move to listing the hotel chain within the next two years.
'It's good news to see Cofir at last buying growth potential assets again to
take them to the market,' said Mr Carlos Pertejo of AB Asesores, a Madrid
securities firm.
Mr De Benedetti's group is close to completing the purchase of a 100-unit
family-owned supermarket chain called Dagesa which is based in Catalonia and
in Aragon, two of Spain's fastest-growing regions.
The retailing business represents a new division for Cofir and this
acquisition is likely to be followed up by further ones in the sector.
Cofir is assessing properties in the wine business where it controls
Berberena, the second-ranked Rioja producer, with the stated aim of becoming
Spain's leading table wine group.
The group's real estate division has in the meantime been lifted by the
announcement that the 1997 Ryder cup will be played on the Valderrama golf
course.
This is one of three located in its extensive holiday home and leisure
complex of Sotogrande, near Gibraltar.

<TEXT>
USAir, the loss-making US carrier in which British Airways has a 24.6 per
cent stake, is seeking pay and benefit cost cuts of Dollars 500m from
employees to help reduce annual operating expenses by Dollars 1bn.
Outlining details of USAir's cost-cutting programme at a Merrill Lynch
transportation conference in New York, Mr Seth Schofield, USAir's chairman
and chief executive, said the carrier had introduced measures to reduce
costs by Dollars 175m this year. These included job cuts, subcontracting
freight and mail handling, and improved inventory management. He said USAir
would not attain its goal of cutting annual costs by Dollars 1bn unless pay
and benefits were lowered to 'levels more consistent with market standards'.
Talks with the unions were under way. Mr Schofield said that when agreement
on a cost-reduction plan was obtained from at least one of the three primary
unions, the carrier would implement the measures with both its members and
all non-union employees.
The US fares war has prevented the airline from turning around its finances.
In the first quarter of this year, USAir lost Dollars 196.7m.
The carrier wants to cut costs through fleet rationalisation, more
productive flight crew and aircraft scheduling, the centralisation of cargo
management and purchasing, distribution system refinements and contracting
out catering.
This month, labour unions announced plans to seek a federal injunction to
stop USAir's plans to contract out its freight and mail handling operations.
USAir shares closed unchanged at Dollars 6 1/2 in New York.
Delta Air Lines, seeking to slash annual costs, is to suspend four
transatlantic routes - New York-Oslo, New York-Stockholm, Miami-London and
Cincinnati-Munich - and remove all 13 Airbus A-130 aircraft from its fleet.
United Airlines said it was seeking to take over Delta's Miami-London route.

Group freight revenue was unchanged at NKr1.2bn but operating profit, before

green light

   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shareholders of Finmeccanica, the Italian state-controlled engineering and
defence group, yesterday approved a L1,700bn (Dollars 1.05bn) rights issue,
which will reduce the stake owned by Iri, the state holding company, to less
than 60 per cent from 85 per cent.
Iri is to pay nearly L500bn for its new shares and a further L1,000bn should
be subscribed by the creditor banks of Efim, the now defunct state holding
company which is transferring its defence interests to Finmeccanica.
The banks said their underwriting of the issue was conditional on the
completion of the transfer of the seven Efim companies, which include
Agusta, the helicopter manufacturer. Finmeccanica said yesterday that the
exercise of its option to buy the companies was 'a formality' and should
take place on June 20.
The deal was agreed by the government three months ago, and means that
Finmeccanica will not have to assume the Efim companies' L7,000bn of debts.
Although the issue is a form of privatisation, the plan prevents the
government losing control of strategic defence manufacturers.
Finmeccanica's shares fell L34 to close at L1,942 in Milan yesterday,
compared with the issue price of L2,100.

<TEXT>
Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian prime minister and media magnate, should
raise L990bn (Dollars 611m) through the sale of a 53 per cent stake in
Mondadori, the company which groups all his book and magazine publishing
interests.
The price of the international offering of 66m new Mondadori shares was
yesterday set at L15,000 a share, at the top of the range established by Mr
Berlusconi's banking advisers - Mediobanca and Banca Commerciale Italiana -
in April.
Mr Franco Tato, managing director of Mr Berlusconi's Fininvest business
empire and of Mondadori, returned from an international roadshow last week
bullish about the prospects for the sale, which begins tomorrow.
The offering will be watched carefully, not only by investors and bankers,
but also by political opponents of Mr Berlusconi. This is the first attempt
by the new prime minister to distance himself from his business interests,
which range from television and football to financial services and
retailing.
Mr Berlusconi is under pressure to sell-off parts of this empire to cut
debts at Fininvest and reduce the risk of a conflict of interest between his
political and entrepreneurial ambitions.
Observers are also eager to see if the decision of Mediobanca to work with
Fininvest for the first time on this deal marks the beginning of a powerful
alliance between Mr Berlusconi and Mr Enrico Cuccia, the merchant bank's
86-year-old honorary chairman.
Less than 2 per cent of Mondadori - the full name of which is Arnoldo
Mondadori Editore - is still quoted on the Milan stock exchange. But ahead
of the offering, Mondadori merged with Silvio Berlusconi Editore, the
private company which held many of the prime minister's publishing
interests, to create one of the largest publishing companies in Europe.
The combined group, in which Mr Berlusconi will have a 47 per cent stake,
would have shown a gross operating profit of L252bn last year, on sales of
L1,830bn.
The net profit for the enlarged group would have been about L100bn in 1993.
Mr Berlusconi last month appointed Mr Giovanni Spadolini - a former Italian
prime minister and political opponent of Mr Berlusconi - to Mondadori's
board, as a guarantee of the company's independence. Several political and
business associates of Mr Berlusconi stepped down at the same time, but Mr
Berlusconi also appointed his two grown-up children from his first marriage
as directors, an indication that his family is unlikely ever to abandon
ultimate control of Fininvest companies.

FT  15 JUN 94 / International Company News: Pechiney packaging arm hit by
warning

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Pechiney Inter-national, the packaging arm of Pechiney, the French
state-owned aluminium group, fell sharply yesterday following a warning by
Mr Jean Gandois, chairman, of a fall in first-half profits.
The shares lost 5.6 per cent to close at FFr152.2 following Mr Gandois's
statement to the company's shareholders' meeting. However, he added that he
expected an improvement in the second half of the year, compared with the
first six months.
According to Mr Gandois, first-half profits will be hit by increased
financial charges, partly reflecting higher US interest rates, and the cost
of recent investments and acquisitions. The result, he said, would be a
reduction in net profits compared with the FFr439m (Dollars 77m), after
amortisation, recorded in the first six months of 1993.
Mr Gandois said the company was considering a convertible bond issue,
although the size and the timing had not been decided. The company said
recovery in the weak Paris stock market would be necessary before an issue
could be launched.
Mr Gandois said sales in the packaging division had shown a relatively
strong improvement since the beginning of the year, but prices had remained
uncertain.

FT  15 JUN 94 / International Company News: MetLife and Travelers combine
operations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Metropolitan Life and Travelers are combining their health insurance
businesses in a joint venture company. The deal is a further sign of the
consolidation among US managed healthcare organisations.
Travelers, which has the smaller health insurance business of the two, has
agreed to pass to MetLife disability, dental care and other insurance
businesses with annual premiums of more Dollars 950m in return for a
half-share in the new company.
Travelers is also selling MetLife its group life insurance business for
Dollars 350m.
By growing in size, healthcare groups hope to reduce unit costs and force
bigger discounts from healthcare providers, such as hospitals and drugs
companies.
The deal marks the first steps taken by Mr Sanford Weill, whose Primerica
financial services group took over Travelers at the end of last year, to
sort out some parts of Travelers' underperforming insurance operations.
Earlier this year, Mr Weill predicted mergers in the insurance industry as
companies sought greater efficiency.
The two insurers said their new company, which had yet to be named, would
provide health insurance to 13m people.
However, only 391,000 of these are in the two companies' health maintenance
organisations (HMOs), under which individuals are serviced by a prescribed
network of doctors and hospitals.
This leaves them well behind other insurers. At the end of last year, Cigna
had 2.7m people in its HMOs, Prudential 1.6m, Aetna 905,000 and Sanus (a
division of New York Life) 651,000, according to the Group Health
Association of America, an industry trade association.
All US insurers are attempting to move people from their traditional
fee-for-service plans into HMOs, which have become a more profitable way of
proving healthcare cover.

FT  15 JUN 94 / UK Company News: GCIH seeks 75% of Meltis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Grand Central Investment Holdings, the food group with interests in Asia
Pacific, yesterday announced the proposed acquisition of 75 per cent of
Meltis, one of the UK's largest privately owned chocolate manufacturers, for
Pounds 5.6m.
Mr Ishwar Nagappan, chairman, said the acquisition fulfilled the company's
needs to establish a UK base to complement its east Asian activities.
'Meltis is a long-established name in confectionary and offers excellent
scope for organic growth,' he said.
Meltis, which had warranted net assets of Pounds 5.3m in April, was
established in the early 1920's. Its branded products include Turkish
Delight.
Mr Mervyn Weeden and Mr Paul Mustoe, joint managing directors of Meltis,
will retain 25 per cent of the shares and have agreed to enter service
agreements with Meltis.
The purchase price will comprise Pounds 3.6m in cash and Pounds 2m in loan
notes.
Grand Central also announced the disposal of virtually its entire 24 per
cent stake in Armour Trust. The sale of 6.35m shares at 53p would raise
Pounds 3.4m.
In results for the 1993 year, released yesterday, Grand Central fell into
the red with pre-tax losses of Pounds 968,000 against profits of Pounds
2.8m.
Turnover rose from Pounds 66.6m to Pounds 67.8m while operating profits fell
from Pounds 3.3m to Pounds 318,000.
Exceptional items fell from Pounds 1.2m to Pounds 587,000.
Losses per share stood at 2.77p against earnings of 3.08p. No dividend is
recommended, compared with 1.25p.

FT  15 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Marshalls up 64%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits of Marshalls, the Halifax-based building materials group,
jumped by 64 per cent from Pounds 12.4m to Pounds 20.4m during the 12 months
to the end of March as it took full advantage of the housing market
recovery.
Profits also were assisted by lengthening the depreciation period for large
items of equipment from 10-15 years to 15-20 years. This added Pounds 2m to
pre-tax profits and 1.8p to earnings, said Marshalls.
Even without this adjustment, operating profits increased 58 per cent, from
Pounds 12.4m to Pounds 21.7m. Earnings per share after the adjustment rose
from 3.93p to 8.62p.
Mr Andrew Marshall, chairman, said the trading improvement had been greater
than expected enabling the group to increase its final dividend to 3p making
a total for the year of 4.25p (4p).
The recovery in the housing market prompted a 12 per cent rise in UK
turnover of stone and concrete products, mainly for paving and flooring, to
Pounds 143m (Pounds 127.7m). Operating profits, boosted by higher volume
sales and increased emphasis on higher margin products rose by 44 per cent
to Pounds 17.9m (Pounds 12.4m) including Pounds 1.6m from reduced
depreciation.

<TEXT>
A sharply lower contribution from its North American gas equipment
subsidiary meant pre-tax profits of Neotronics Technology fell from Pounds
956,000 to Pounds 509,000 in the six months to March 31. Sales slipped from
Pounds 10.5m to Pounds 9.85m.
Mr Paul Gotley, chairman, said some market share had been lost in North
America, but measures taken had meant that by the end of March some of this
share had been recaptured.
German sales had fallen slightly after an exceptionally good first half last
time.
Earnings per share were 1p lower at 1.38p. The interim dividend is
maintained at 0.85p, but Mr Gotley cautioned that the level of the final
would be reviewed in the light of the full year results.

Severely reduced margins in a depressed market coupled with reorganisation
costs resulted in Wellman, the specialist engineer, reporting pre-tax losses
of Pounds 1.07m for the year to March 31, against profits of Pounds 681,000.
Mr Geoffrey Iley, chairman, said that a slow improvement in trading had come
too late to affect the result, but a marked upturn in order intake should
have a significant impact on trading in the present year.
Reflecting this, the final dividend is held at 0.6p for an unchanged total
of 0.9p. Losses per share were 3.6p (earnings 1p).
Turnover was Pounds 22.3m (Pounds 23.7m). There was a trading loss of Pounds

recovery.
Profits also were assisted by lengthening the depreciation period for large
items of equipment from 10-15 years to 15-20 years. This added Pounds 2m to
pre-tax profits and 1.8p to earnings, said Marshalls.
Even without this adjustment, operating profits increased 58 per cent, from
Pounds 12.4m to Pounds 21.7m. Earnings per share after the adjustment rose
from 3.93p to 8.62p.
Mr Andrew Marshall, chairman, said the trading improvement had been greater
than expected enabling the group to increase its final dividend to 3p making
a total for the year of 4.25p (4p). The group hoped to increase dividends
further this year provided trading continued to improve.
The recovery in the housing market prompted a 12 per cent rise in UK
turnover of stone and concrete products, mainly for paving and flooring, to
Pounds 143m (Pounds 127.7m). Operating profits, boosted by higher volume
sales and increased emphasis on higher margin products rose by 44 per cent
to Pounds 17.9m (Pounds 12.4m) including Pounds 1.6m from reduced
depreciation.
US losses for stone and concrete declined from Pounds 800,000 to Pounds
600,000. The US had generated a profit in the first two months of the
current financial year, said Mr Marshall.
Operating profits from clay products in the UK rose sharply from Pounds
255,000 to Pounds 3.1m against a turnover increase of just 14 per cent to
Pounds 22.5m (Pounds 19.7m).
The engineering division, which supplies equipment for drilling rock, also
increased operating profit, from Pounds 889,000 to Pounds 1.29m.
Net debt at the end of March stood at Pounds 25.4m (Pounds 21.3m) equivalent
to gearing of 20.7 per cent (18.2 per cent). This, however, included Pounds
64m of cumulative convertible preference shares, redeemable in 2004 as
equity.

FT  15 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Severn Trent held to 4% rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Delays on international contracts held back the profits advance at Severn
Trent as the group announced a 4 per cent increase to Pounds 281.4m at the
pre-tax level for the year to March 31. Sales were 10 per cent higher at
Pounds 998m.
The results were at the lower end of expectations, and the shares moved up
just 1p to close at 527p.
The proposed final dividend is raised by 7.8 per cent to 15.2p, for a
similar increase in the total to 22.75p. This compared with forecasts of an
8.5 per cent rise. Earnings were 4 per cent up at 72.7p.
Mr Roderick Paul, chief executive, said Severn had taken action to cut costs
following the Pounds 4.7m operating loss incurred by the international
division last year.
The loss had been largely because of delays on two contracts, in Mexico and
New York, the subsequent restructuring charges, and the costs of marketing
the international business. Marketing had been cut back, costs reduced and
the division was now operating profitably, he said.
Mr Paul was more upbeat about Biffa, the waste management arm. It had lifted
operating profits by 18 per cent to Pounds 14.2m on sales 16 per cent higher
at Pounds 120.6m in a difficult market. The return reflected the 'stringent
control of operating costs and strength of our sales and marketing
initiatives,' Mr Paul said.
Biffa's ability to improve margins in its landfill business had been because
of a changing mix of waste, rather than any underlying improvement in
prices, he said. However, prices were beginning to show tentative signs of
recovery.
The division is believed to have incurred losses of Pounds 11m after
interest, because of onerous financing arrangements at the time of the
acquisition.
Profits growth in the core utility business was held back by a 7.8 per cent
decline in usage by the top 1,500 industrial users. The rate of decline had
begun to slow, Mr Paul said. Operating profits in the water and sewerage
business rose by 11 per cent to Pounds 324.6m, on sales 6 per cent ahead to
Pounds 787.5m.
Severn said costs in the water business had risen by 3.6 per cent. The
workforce had been reduced by about 6 per cent, bringing the number of jobs
cut in two years to 889. Severn was continuing to examine opportunities for
cost-cutting although it refused to give details.
Capital expenditure was some Pounds 25m less than budgeted at Pounds 445m
(Pounds 550m). Net debt rose by Pounds 153.4m to Pounds 575.8m, representing
27 per cent of shareholders' funds.

FT  15 JUN 94 / UK Company News: AFG tumbles to Pounds 21.2m loss after
restructuring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Automotive and Financial Group, one of the leading UK motor dealer groups
and which is controlled by Mr Octav Botnar, tumbled to a pre-tax loss of
Pounds 21.2m last year compared with profits of Pounds 3.76m.
Turnover in the 12 months to end-July 1993 fell by 25 per cent to Pounds
330.7m (Pounds 438.8m), as the company was forced to undertake a substantial
restructuring in response to the loss of the Nissan importer/distributor
franchise by its sister company Nissan UK in 1991.
AFG's 180 dealerships, which all previously sold Nissan vehicles, have been
cut back to a network of 78 outlets, while the company's workforce has been
reduced from 3,153 to 2,120, according to the latest annual report.
The company has been turned into a multi-franchise dealer group operating
for several leading carmakers including Citroen, Peugeot, Fiat, Honda,
Renault, Vauxhall, Rover and Volkswagen/Audi.
It is currently ranked 11th by turnover among UK motor dealer groups,
according to the latest listing of the top 100 car retailers by Automotive
Management magazine.
AFG said in its annual report that it had succeeded in re-franchising 70 of
the remaining 78 dealerships, but the costs of the restructuring had been
high.
'We have only been able to take new franchises in markets where a
manufacturer has previously had a very weak dealer or no dealer at all, and
substantial investment in time and money will be required before the
dealerships can trade profitably.'
Five of the former seven-man board of AFG resigned in the 14 months to
October last year.
Three new directors have been appointed including Mr Botnar and his
secretary, Ms Dawn Lawson.
The Pounds 21.2m pre-tax loss was reduced to a net loss of Pounds 9.6m
thanks to a tax credit of Pounds 11.7m, described as 'group relief
receivable'.
Current assets in the balance sheet include some Pounds 11m of corporation
tax said to be recoverable as a 'group relief receivable from fellow
subsidiary undertakings'.
The heavy loss in the AFG motor dealer operations was offset by a pre-tax
profit of Pounds 27.8m achieved by the finance division, Automotive
Financial Services, and a pre-tax profit of Pounds 4.6m from the group's
property division.
As part of the retrenchment being undertaken by AFGH, its parent company,
the volume of new business being taken on by the finance subsidiary is being
reduced, with a concentration on business introduced by AFG dealers rather
than the provision of instalment credit to consumers and businesses in other
sectors.
As part of the group restructuring, AFGH has also sold Automotive Leasing,
its contract hire subsidiary, and has ceased trading in Automotive and
Industrial Machinery, its fork lift truck distribution subsidiary.
Partslink, the group's automotive parts import and distribution subsidiary,
suffered a trading loss last year and operations have now been concentrated
on wholesale distribution.

FT  15 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Benfield expands its reinsurance activities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Benfield Group, one of the UK's most successful reinsurance brokers, will
today announce the launch of Benfield Re, a Pounds 50m London market
reinsurance company.
The venture is the latest of a number of new international reinsurance
companies to have been launched in the last 18 months, following rises in
rates after heavy losses between 1988 and 1992.
Institutional investors backing the venture include Montagu Private Equity
and Royal Bank Development Capital, the venture capital arm of the Royal
Bank of Scotland, which also owns Direct Line, the highly profitable
direct-response insurer.
Institutions will invest Pounds 12.5m, with Benfield Group supplying Pounds
17.5m from existing cash resources. A further Pounds 20m of senior debt has
been raised from Citibank and Lloyds Bank.
Benfield Re will specialise in catastrophe reinsurance, underwriting
sections of contracts negotiated by about a dozen so-called 'lead'
underwriters from both Lloyd's and the London company market.
It can accept up to Pounds 125m in premiums, although with rate competition
beginning to return to the market, income in its first year, probably
starting in January 1995, is likely to be much less.
'The new venture will perform a long-term role in the Benfield strategy. It
is not under pressure to write premium to give us a return,' stressed Mr
Matthew Harding, chairman.
He said the new company would underwrite contracts brokered by a range of
brokers but would have 'pretty obvious access to Benfield's account'.
Like the Benfield brokerage group, the new company will co-operate with
Frankona, a German reinsurance company, and Fortress Re, a US agency which
underwrites on behalf of a group of Japanese companies.
Benfield Group has grown rapidly in the last four years and made pre-tax
profits of Pounds 31.2m in 1993 on turnover of Pounds 38.8m. Net asset value
was Pounds 30.2m at June 30 1993.
Four of its directors figured prominently in a recent listing of 500 of the
UK's most wealthy individuals. Mr Harding, whose personal wealth was
estimated at more than Pounds 100m in the survey, owns a minority stake in
Chelsea Football Club after injecting Pounds 5m last year. His salary rose
from Pounds 2.2m to Pounds 2.4m last year.
One of Benfield's four other directors earned more than Pounds 1.3m last
year while another exceeded Pounds 985,000.
With a total staff of 60 and a wage bill of more than Pounds 10m, including
directors, Benfield's per capita pay rates - and profits - are among the
highest in the UK.

Symonds Engineering cut its pre-tax loss from Pounds 456,000 to Pounds
285,000 in the year to end-March after providing for exceptional items of
Pounds 200,000, against Pounds 115,000.
After missing the last interim and final dividends, the precision engineer
declared a final of 0.25p - last year's interim was 0.15p.
Mr Rod Ackrill, chairman, said the result was partly due to a return to
profitable trading in the second half and to restructuring. The exceptional
item relates to a recently completed redundancy programme.
Turnover showed a small increase from Pounds 4.38m to Pounds 4.43m and
despite the loss there was a net cash inflow from operating activities.
Losses per share were 2.9p (4.6p).

Mr Richard Dunn, chairman, said: 'The strong performance was a satisfying
mix of organic growth and initial contributions from two acquisitions.'
The shares advanced 14p to 278p.
Turnover was Pounds 8.68m (Pounds 5.72m), including Pounds 1.86m from
acquisitions, for operating profits of Pounds 1.25m (Pounds 534,000),
including Pounds 122,000 from acquisitions. Earnings per share were 7.4p

FT  15 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Exco floats with Pounds 220m tag
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Exco, the money broking arm of the collapsed British &amp; Commonwealth group,
is proceeding with its flotation, despite the softening demand for new
issues and the slowing of activity in the fixed income securities markets.
The company will offer up to Pounds 110m of shares, primarily comprising
B&amp;C's 40 per cent stake, and the flotation is expected to value the company
at about Pounds 220m.
The company, which derives half of its profits from money broking and half
from fixed income securities trading, is forecasting pre-tax profits growth
of at least 21 per cent at the interim stage.
This follows what Mr Ron Sandler, chief executive, described as an
'exceptional first quarter', due to increased interest rates in the US and
political uncertainty in Japan.
He said this would not be carried through for the year, but 1993 earnings
should be 'satisfactory'.
Exco will be only the second pure money broking and securities company on
the stock market, along with Trio.
Money broking is a competitive and volatile business, and Exco's issue price
will reflect this, with a likely p/e ratio of between 9.5 and 10.5. However,
the shares should offer a yield of more than 5 per cent.
Exco has achieved substantial earnings growth over the past three years, in
the face of an increasingly competitive market place.
The trend for money broking commissions has been steadily downwards. In
addition, foreign exchange trading - one third of 1993 money broking profits
 -has seen a loss of market share to direct trading between the banks.
However, Mr Sandler said the broker market for foreign exchange continued to
grow in absolute terms, while the group has benefited from the explosive
growth in derivative products.
The flotation price will be announced on June 29, and dealings are due to
commence on July 19. Up to half the company's shares will be offered through
a placing and public offer.

FT  15 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Berisford Pounds 5.8m in red after
provision
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Berisford International, the former commodities and property group which
paid Pounds 56m for the Magnet kitchen and joinery business in March,
yesterday reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 5.8m for the half year to March
31 compared with profits of Pounds 400,000.
The result was after a Pounds 9.7m provision covering the write-off of
Bristar Trading, Berisford's cocoa trading associate. If any cash is
recouped from this business it will come back through the profit and loss
account.
At the operating level Berisford achieved profits of Pounds 3.7m (Pounds
1.5m losses). Magnet contributed Pounds 1.4m of the profit, but Mr Alan
Bowkett, chief executive, stressed that March was traditionally Magnet's
best month as January sales turned into profits. Even so, Mr John Sclater,
chairman, remained confident of predicting the payment of a final dividend.
Turnover rose to Pounds 51.3m (Pounds 47.3m) with Magnet contributing Pounds
16.9m. Losses per share were 4.4p (0.2p earnings).
Since the half-year end, Mr Bowkett said, Magnet had remained profitable in
spite of a repositioning programme in April and May when advertising was
stopped. Branches now served both trade and retail customers and ranges had
been rationalised.
Magnet's workforce had been cut from 2,600 to 2,000, with 400 jobs going in
the shops and 130 in the factories. More than Pounds 4m had been invested in
new kitchen manufacturing equipment. One new outlet has been opened while
Berisford has identified 50 places where it could open branches.
The group is also continuing to realise some 'old Berisford' assets,
including properties with a book value of Pounds 16m.
It aims to retain its US agribusinesses, although these are expected to
incur losses in the second half, in order to protect its US tax losses which
total Pounds 434m. A senior executive is being posted to New York to search
out an acquisition in the US.
Following the rights issue, which funded the Magnet purchase, net cash was
Pounds 53.8m at March 31, which has since risen to Pounds 54.7m, and net
assets were Pounds 214.7m.
Mr Robert Pritzker, has resigned as a non-executive director, although his
brother Jay is remaining on the board. The two are large shareholders in the
group.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Applied Holographics, the USM-quoted producer of holographic products for
security and packaging uses, yesterday reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds
276,395 for the year to the end of March.
The result, which compared with losses of Pounds 2.26m last time, came on
turnover ahead to Pounds 5.8m (Pounds 4.96m) despite a fall to Pounds
700,066 (Pounds 1.37m) in hot stamping foil sales following a deal agreed a
year ago to sell the business to Whiley Foils. Gross margins were affected
by the slower than expected transfer of production to Whiley.
Losses per share were 1.3p (losses of 11.2p). The company's deficit now
stands at Pounds 17.5m.
Floated 10 years ago, the company has never made a full year profit.
However, directors were confident about current year prospects against a
background of 48 per cent and 47 per cent growth respectively in sales in
the security and packaging product ranges and the completion of
restructuring to focus on the core business.
Mr David Mahony, chairman, said shareholders, mainly large institutions, had
been 'very patient'. 'They have understood what the company was trying to do
and have seen it through. They see the potential there,' he added.
Three investment trusts, new investors in the company, had taken up a
placing of 997,620 new ordinary shares, raising Pounds 800,000 for
investment in production equipment.
Operating losses were Pounds 219,014 (Pounds 1.39m).

FT  15 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Central Railway seeks Pounds 6m for
start-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first railway company to seek private finance to build a modern rail
route in mainland Britain for more than 50 years yesterday announced plans
to raise between Pounds 5m and Pounds 6m from private investors.
Central Railway Group plans to create a 180-mile railway line from Leicester
to the Channel tunnel entrance to carry trucks on flatbed wagons.
The total cost of the project is estimated at Pounds 3bn, but Pounds 5m to
Pounds 6m is needed to fund the obtaining of parliamentary approval.
The route will consist of disused track, parts of the existing network in
the Chilterns and new track in tunnels under London. Tunnels and bridges
would have to be widened to take the trucks.
Trucks-on trains are common in continental Europe but the smaller loading
gauge of the British rail network has meant it has not been possible to
transport complete trucks in the past.
Central Railway believes the offer will prove more attractive to private
investors than to institutions though there will be no dividends for at
least seven years.
Some investors may also be put off, however, by the repeated refinancings
needed to raise the Pounds 11bn required to build the Channel tunnel.
Central Railway is making an offer to the public of up to 6m Pounds 1 shares
in minimum subscription amounts of Pounds 500. The offer has not been
underwritten and, given the small size of the issue, a Stock Exchange
listing will not be sought.
Subscriptions are open between June 10 and July 19.
The company believes it can capture 15 per cent of international truck
traffic, about 1.75m trucks, travelling between the UK and the Continent by
2005.
It plans to build terminals in Leicester, west London and in northern
France.
Crucial to the project is for Central Railway to acquire ownership of all
the track. This would require the agreement of Railtrack, which owns the
former British Rail track and signalling and which, in general, plans to
retain ownership of the track. Initial talks have been held.
The project has been under preparation for four years and has provoked
scepticism among some people in the transport industry.
Central Railway is the brainchild of Mr Andrew Gritten, a former political
analyst who developed an interest in rail projects while working as a
researcher at the Centre for Policy Studies.

FT  15 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Overseas buys help Volex rise 40% to Pounds
10.3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Overseas acquisitions and organic growth helped Volex Group, the
restructured electrical interconnection products and cable assemblies
company, record a 40 per cent increase in full year pre-tax profits.
The increase from Pounds 7.34m to Pounds 10.3m in the year to March 31 came
on turnover ahead 26 per cent to Pounds 149.2m (Pounds 118.3m), partly
reflecting the impact of three acquisitions made during the previous year in
the US and south-east Asia.
Organic growth accounted for about 12 percentage points of the increase.
Sales of products manufactured in the UK increased by 9 per cent to Pounds
86.6m while those of products manufactured overseas increased by 62 per cent
and represented 42 per cent of total group turnover.
Earnings pre share increased by a more modest 9 per cent to 23.6p (21.7p)
after a 23 per cent increase in the average number of shares following the
Pounds 17.5m rights issue in February last year, partly offset by a reduced
tax rate.
An increased final dividend of 11.6p lifts the total to 18.1p (17.85p).
Mr Oliver Chapple, chief executive since October, said the results
highlighted the successful consolidation and integration of the acquisitions
made in the previous three years. As a result Volex was now an international
manufacturer and supplier of interconnect products to original equipment
manufacturers in the computer, medical telecommunications and appliance
industries.
Operating profit increased by 41 per cent to Pounds 10.4m (Pounds 7.41m) and
operating profit margin improved from 6.3 per cent to 7 per cent reflecting
the greater impact on the group's performance of its power cord and data
assembly operations which were enlarged considerably, partly as a result of
acquisitions.
Interest costs rose to Pounds 1.03m (Pounds 366,000). The group moved from
net cash of Pounds 5.86m to marginal net debt at the end of the year after
capital expenditure of Pounds 7m. Investment income rose to Pounds 855,000
(Pounds 297,000).

FT  15 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Whitecroft in the black with
better-than-expected Pounds 4.3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Whitecroft, the lighting, medical cotton fibre, industrial textiles and
building products group, returned to profits and the dividend list in the 12
months to March 31.
A pre-tax outcome of Pounds 4.3m compared with losses last time of Pounds
41.8m - a result well ahead of analyst's expectations; the shares rose 11p
to 120p.
The recovery was achieved despite flat turnover of Pounds 124.9m - a decline
of Pounds 23,000.
The previous loss included substantial provision for previously overvalued
property - a sector which almost brought Whitecroft down in the recession
and from which it has since exited. The improvement is better judged by
operating profits which quadrupled to nearly Pounds 5.95m (Pounds 1.36m).
The dividend is restored at 2p, payable from earnings per share of 8.8p
compared with losses of 94.5p.
Year-end borrowings were halved to Pounds 18m (Pounds 36.4m) and gearing
fell from 153 per cent to 67 per cent.
Mr Mike Derbyshire, chief executive, said the performance vindicated the
board's decision a year ago not to launch a rights issue to reduce debt,
even though some institutional investors would have backed one.
This leaves a cash call available for expansion, although Mr Derbyshire
stressed the company had no takeover target in sight - or any other plans
that could not be financed from existing resources.
Lighting increased sales by Pounds 4m to Pounds 49.7m and improved profits
to Pounds 4.96m (Pounds 3.95m).
Medical cotton fibre - tampons - lifted sales by 11 per cent to Pounds
15.6m, with profits of Pounds 2.32m (Pounds 1.79m).
Building products - mainly fire-resistant doors - and textiles - a principal
product is book cloth and fabrics for passports and bankbooks  - incurred
small losses. Mr Derbyshire expects both sectors to recover.
An easing of property markets was behind the improvement in the balance
sheet. The Pounds 14.4m of written-down property awaiting disposal last year
was down to Pounds 6.31m by the year-end.
Since then, the company has sold an option to buy back a retail property in
Stockport that it disposed of in 1991. Profit of nearly Pounds 6m has
reduced current borrowings to about Pounds 12m and gearing to 34 per cent.

FT  15 JUN 94 / UK Company News: East Surrey aided by exceptional
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
East Surrey Holdings, the property, water and building supplies group,
turned in a 45 per cent increase in pre-tax profit for the year to March 31,
from Pounds 5.7m to Pounds 8.28m.
The outcome included a Pounds 1.89m exceptional profit arising from land
sales.
Turnover was ahead at Pounds 25.5m (Pounds 24.4m), with Pounds 22.7m (Pounds
21.9m) coming from water supplies.
Following a 5 per cent drop in the first half, metered consumption at East
Surrey Water returned to the previous year's level in the second half, and
the company 'performed well', said Mr John Fooks, chairman.
'Costs are under control and have benefited from lower than average demand
during the summer of 1993 and a reduction in water lost through leakage,' he
said.
Capital and infrastructure spending was increased to Pounds 6.49m (Pounds
5.89m), with expenditure rescheduled to develop treatment works and build
pesticide removal plant by December 1995.
Earnings per share came out at 56.4p (38.8p). A recommended final of 7.95p
brings the total dividend to 12.38p (11.46p).

FT  15 JUN 94 / UK Company News: New projects help David Lloyd to Pounds 3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
David Lloyd Leisure, the tennis and health club company, yesterday announced
a 53 per cent increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.94m to Pounds 2.96m
for the six months to March 31, fuelled by increased membership and
contributions from two new projects.
On a like-for-like basis, the clubs reported a 13 per cent rise, with
membership fees up by 3 per cent more than the inflation rate. Turnover from
continuing operations rose 26 per cent to Pounds 11m (Pounds 8.75m), helped
by a 9 per cent increase in memberships from existing clubs to 23,000.
The company's newest club, in Glasgow, cost more than Pounds 5m to develop
and opened in October. It has already sold 3,000 memberships, and was
profitable at the interim stage, despite a Pounds 150,000 write-off of
pre-opening costs.
In addition, the company saw a six month contribution from its new bowling
centre in Raynes Park, London.
It is on target with its stated policy of introducing two new clubs per
year. Work has started on developments in Birmingham, Bristol and Reading,
which are due to open in the first half of 1995.
Interest payments dropped Pounds 524,000 to Pounds 143,000, due to the
impact of cash raised from the March 1993 flotation.
Gearing, however, has risen from 13 to 14 per cent in the past 12 months,
and the company is signing up a Pounds 30m banking facility to help fund
expansion.
Earnings per share rose 15 per cent to 4.73p (4.1p). A first interim
dividend of 1.45p is declared.

FT  15 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Courtaulds chief gets 25% increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Sipko Huismans, chief executive of Courtaulds, received a 25 per cent pay
increase from Pounds 284,150 to Pounds 355,353 in 1994, according to the
chemical company's annual report.
Pre-tax profits last year fell by 35 per cent from Pounds 186m to Pounds
122m.
The figure was affected by exceptional items and a higher interest bill
although even at the operating level profits slipped by 16 per cent to
Pounds 176.4m.
Mr Huismans' pay included a basic Pounds 320,000 (Pounds 270,000) and a
performance-related bonus of Pounds 12,800 this time. Benefits in kind
increased 59 per cent to Pounds 22,553 (Pounds 14,150).
Under the company's executive share option scheme, Mr Huismans was granted
options on 30,000 more shares taking his total to 195,000.
He already owns 20,500 shares.
Sir Christopher Hogg, chairman, saw his pay rise by 3.7 per cent, from
Pounds 110,058 to Pounds 114,131. He has no executive share options but
already owns 121,000 shares.
Two other Courtaulds directors received packages worth between Pounds
215,001 and Pounds 220,000. In 1993 the second and third highest paid
directors each received between Pounds 185,001 and Pounds 190,000.

Eurocopy, the office equipment distributor, continued its recovery with
pre-tax profits up 34 per cent to Pounds 1.64m in the half year to March 31.
This followed a jump of 54 per cent to Pounds 2.6m for 1992-93. The shares
closed 3p higher at 68p yesterday.
Mr Cyril Gay, chairman, said that machine sales remained level but there was
a small growth in copy volume. Triangle Systems, acquired in January, made a
small contribution.
Turnover dipped to Pounds 13.2m reflecting the disposal of the furniture
division. Earnings per share rose from 1.68p to 2.27p and the interim
dividend is 0.6p (0.5p).

FT  15 JUN 94 / UK Company News: BSS up 51% and sees more growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROLINE SOUTHEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BSS Group, the heating, plumbing and process control supplier, ended four
years of unchanged dividends after reporting a 51 per cent rise in pre-tax
profits from Pounds 6.54m to Pounds 9.86m for the year to March 31.
A final dividend of 12p (11.5p) is recommended, bringing the total to 17.75p
(17.25p) on earnings per share up 44 per cent from 16.7p to 24p.
Operating profits rose from Pounds 7.84m to Pounds 10.8m on increased sales
of Pounds 258.1m (Pounds 243.7m).
The strongest contribution came from the industrial and commercial
construction division where profits rose by 27 per cent to Pounds 12.7m on
turnover of Pounds 154.4m (Pounds 149.8m).
The domestic division, one of the top three distributors to the heating
market in the UK, showed a turnround from losses of Pounds 712,000 to
profits of Pounds 44,000 following the integration of three businesses,
Heatek, Labone and Cadel, into a new company, Zenith Plumbpoint.
Mr Alan Milne, finance director, said the turnround had been achieved now
that the 'worst of the recession is behind us'. However, the upturn in the
construction industry remained tentative.
In the commercial sector new building work remained 40 per cent below the
peak volumes of 1990. But, as a market leader he predicted that BSS would
continue to take market share.
He said the company was 'very positive about the next few years when we will
see good growth in our performance'.
To raise its competitive position and to improve stock availability, the
company said it would establish a single national trunking and central
warehousing system.
Net borrowings were reduced from Pounds 15.4m to Pounds 13.2m for gearing at
the period end of 21.3 per cent (25.5 per cent). Interest charges fell from
Pounds 1.3m to Pounds 958,000.

FT  15 JUN 94 / UK Company News: ACT shares fall 33p on warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in ACT Group, the Birmingham-based computing services company, fell
by almost 20 per cent yesterday after the group warned that trading this
year would be adversely affected by the restructuring of its financial
products division and increased product development expenditure.
The shares closed 33p lower at 136p even though ACT, which has reorganised
its operations substantially over the past five years, also announced a 39
per cent increase in pre-tax profits. They rose, in line with forecasts,
from Pounds 20.5m to Pounds 28.5m during the year to March 31.
Mr Roger Foster, chairman, said
trading would be affected, mainly in the UK, by the decision to integrate
its three financial software operations from April 1 in order to consolidate
the worldwide sales operations, maximise the long-term synergy benefits and
ensure a clear focus for the group's development effort.
In addition, he said the group was planning to spend 13 per cent of its
revenue on product development this year, a Pounds 3m planned increase on
previous years. A large part of this expenditure would be used to invest in
banking software and a new version of the group's Quasar investment
management product.
The pre-tax line was struck on turnover up 64 per cent to Pounds 250.6m
(Pounds 152.9m). Acquisitions, including the BIS Group which was bought for
Pounds 93.5m in July last year, contributed Pounds 73.4m while discontinued
non-core operations accounted for Pounds 61.4m (Pounds 46.5m) of the total.
Operating profits, including a Pounds 9.96m contribution from acquisitions,
increased by 51 per cent to Pounds 28.7m (Pounds 19.1m). Three discontinued
businesses, which were sold generating cash proceeds of Pounds 28m,
contributed profits of Pounds 4.61m (Pounds 5.53m).
The disposals marked the end of ACT's hardware related activities and
completed its transition to a highly focused financial software products
business - the group's financial software products division now accounts for
72 per cent of group turnover and 96 per cent of trading profits from
continuing activities.
The pre-tax result was after net interest costs of Pounds 700,000 (Pounds
1.4m receipts).
Earnings per share increased by 14 per cent to 12.15p (10.63p) and a final
dividend of 3.5p is proposed making a total for the year of 5.25p (5p).
COMMENT
Despite the market's reaction yesterday to the surprise profits warning
ACT's management deserves credit for transforming the group in recent years.
ACT is now firmly established as one of the 20 largest software vendors in
the world and its particular niche - financial software - is one of the
fastest growing market segments. Forecasts for pre-tax profits this year
were downgraded by about Pounds 7m to Pounds 27m because of yesterday's
warning. But this would still give earnings of 10.5p which puts the shares
on a prospective p/e of just under 13. Given the longer-term prospects, the
shares are cheap.

FT  15 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Emap expected to move in with Trans World
bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Emap, the media and exhibitions group, is expected to go ahead next week
with a bid for the Trans World Communications commercial radio group if
agreement cannot be reached by then.
Conversations continued yesterday between the two sides to clarify the
situation following the announcement that Emap had an agreement with Mr Owen
Oyston, the Lancashire millionaire, to buy his 22 per cent stake at 181p.
As Emap already holds 30 per cent of the company this would give the group
control although it is seeking a recommended bid. The deal would value Trans
World at about Pounds 70m.
The proposition is controversial because an Emap takeover of Trans World
would breach the number of radio licences that a single company could hold.
Trans World operates a total of eight local radio services in the UK in
Manchester, Cardiff, Leeds and Preston and has a market value of Pounds 65m.
In the event that an offer is made, the Radio Authority has agreed that an
'ownership structure' could be put in place to cover part of Emap's radio
interests to comply with the rules.

FT  15 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Bradford Property ahead 52% to Pounds 31m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bradford Property Trust, the UK's largest tenanted property company,
announced a 52 per cent rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 20.2m to Pounds
30.7m for the year to April 5.
Net assets per share increased from 170p to 184p, based on directors'
estimates that the value of Bradford's property had risen to Pounds 261.2m
at April 5.
'There are signs of recovery,' said Mr Nigel Denby, company secretary.
'We are anticipating some rise in prices in the next 12 months, although it
is unlikely to be dramatic.'
Much of the increase in profitability stemmed from a rise in property
dealing sales from Pounds 17.1m to Pounds 28.8m.
This included a Pounds 7.87m exceptional property dealing sale from the sale
of 9 acres of land at Martlesham, near Ipswich, for the construction of a
superstore.
If the figures were adjusted to eliminate the exceptional profit and
exceptional pension contribution costs of Pounds 1.18m, the underlying
increase in pre-tax profit would be a 19 per cent rise to Pounds 24.1m.
Mr John Burgess is to retire as managing director at the end of April 1995,
when he will be 61.
Mr Burgess has been managing director for the last 18 years. He will be
succeeded by Mr David Baker and Mr Tim Watts, who will be joint managing
directors.
Mr Baker, aged 54, joined the company in 1963. He will be responsible for
property dealings. Mr Watts, aged 34 and a chartered surveyor, will be
responsible for the operational management of the property portfolio.
Net bank borrowings were reduced from Pounds 26.1m to Pounds 8.3m.
Earnings per share rose by 52 per cent, from 9.4p to 14.25p.
A proposed final dividend of 3.6p makes a total for the year of 6.5p (5.4p).
COMMENT
Bradford's seemingly relentless ability to turn out large dividend increases
has helped defend its share price from the turbulence afflicting the rest of
the property sector. So far this year, its shares have fallen by 8.7 per
cent, just over half the decline suffered by the rest of the sector. But
yesterday the shares were marked down by another 9p to 221p as the market
reacted to a disappointingly modest rise in net asset value. Assuming that
this reaches 200p per share this year, the shares are on a 10 per cent
premium to net asset value, which seems precipitously high compared to the
rest of the sector. But Bradford's strength lies in its ability to grow its
dividend. Assuming another 20 per cent rise this year, the shares are
yielding 4.3 per cent, which should provide a degree of support to the share
price.

Bruce Pattullo, governor of the Bank of Scotland, said yesterday that the
'slow change in Britain's inflation prone culture' was limiting the number
of new investment projects being launched by large UK companies. They were
still seeking high investment despite low inflation.
At the annual meeting in Edinburgh Mr Pattullo said 'the reluctance by
management to adjust downwards the returns which they seek on new projects
means that the new jobs which would be created by new investment
announcements will be delayed'.

FT  15 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Charter plans to build fourth leg
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Charter, the diversified industrial group, could spend between Pounds 200m
and Pounds 400m on building a fourth leg, according to Mr Jeffrey Herbert,
chief executive.
The company was restructured last year, selling its stake in Johnson Matthey
and using part of the proceeds to buy back Minorco's 36 per cent stake. The
deal left Charter with Pounds 156m of cash, and its independence.
The company has refocused on three core businesses of building materials,
coal and rail track equipment. Mr Herbert said a number of proposals were
under consideration for the fourth.
The company also announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 50.1m for the year to
March 31, against Pounds 289.2m, which was distorted by the sale of the
Johnson Matthey stake.
Operating profits from continuing operations fell 4 per cent to Pounds 33.8m
(Pounds 35.2m).
Building materials contributed Pounds 14.7m, up from Pounds 12.6m. Cape,
Charter's listed subsidiary, showed a strong increase in overseas sales, and
Hargreaves, the quarrying business, benefited from new road contracts and a
recovery in the price for aggregates.
The US miners' strike last year cost Charter's coal operations about Pounds
3m, and reduced divisional profit from Pounds 6.2m to Pounds 4m.
Rail track equipment contributed Pounds 13m, up from Pounds 12.5m, despite
shrinking margins on its US maintenance business.
Interest income amounted to Pounds 13.9m, up from Pounds 11.6m, boosted by a
lag between receiving the proceeds from the JM sale, and buying its shares
from Minorco.
The company is proposing a final dividend of 15.5p, making a total for the
year of 22.5p (22p). Earnings per share, distorted by the restructuring,
amounted to 36.4p, against 242.9p.
COMMENT
While Charter's shape may be becoming clearer, the key to its near-term
performance still depends on how the management chooses to spend its cash
pile. There were few surprises in the 1994 figures, and the current year
will show marginal growth at the operating level, but a decline in pre-tax
profits to about Pounds 48m. This would result from falling interest income.
Earnings will benefit from the share buy-back, but Charter is still trading
on a p/e of about 16.3. This is high, but the shares carry almost 230p of
cash, and whatever happens, the management should eke a better return from
an acquisition than a bank vault. In the meantime, investors should continue
to hold.

FT  15 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Cairn Energy US arm to make Dollars 34m
acquisition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROLINE SOUTHEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cairn Energy, the Edinburgh-based oil and gas explorer, yesterday announced
the proposed acquisition by its American subsidiary of oil and gas assets
controlled by Harvard University for Dollars 33.8m (Pounds 22.5m).
Cairn also said it would cut its stake in Cairn Energy USA from 60.5 per
cent to 26.8 per cent through the sale of 3m shares. At a price of Dollars
7.50 per share, the sale would raise Dollars 22.5m net.
CEUSA's acquisition of Smith Offshore Exploration Company 11 from Aeneas
Group, controlled by Harvard University, will give it interests in another
25 blocks in the Gulf of Mexico and offshore along the Texas Gulf coast.
The purchase price, to be satisfied by the issue of 4.5m new CEUSA shares,
will be subject to adjustments based on a valuation of the assets before the
end of June 1995.
Aeneas will also buy 2m of the additional CEUSA shares Cairn is selling, to
give it a stake of 38.3 per cent. Cairn will place the other 1m shares which
are traded on Nasdaq.
Cairn intends to redirect funds raised from the sale to its non-US
businesses.

FT  15 JUN 94 / UK Company News: UK growth behind 28% rise at Attwoods
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Strong UK growth helped Attwoods, the waste management company, to increase
third quarter pre-tax profits by 27 per cent to Pounds 3.8m, on sales Pounds
2.3m lower at Pounds 89.2m.
The group was still struggling to overcome difficulties in Germany, however,
where recession has hit margins.
For the nine months to April 30, pre-tax profits were 43 per cent lower at
Pounds 12.8m on sales 5 per cent ahead to Pounds 267.7m. The profits
included a Pounds 2.7m exceptional charge for settling litigation in the US.
Mr Ken Foreman, chief executive, said 1994 had proved to be difficult.
However, he expected a return to profits growth in 1995.
UK profits improved 39 per cent to Pounds 2.9m, on the back of both volume
and price increases. Further price increases had been implemented in May,
which would help profits in last quarter.
The US solid waste business had performed well in spite of a 24 per cent
fall in operating profits to Pounds 22.3m for the nine months period. The
previous year benefited from Hurricane Andrew.
Mr Foreman said cash flow had covered the costs of all dividend payments in
the first nine months. Attwoods was expected to maintain the payout this
year.
Normalised earnings for the three months were 0.93p (1.42p).

FT  15 JUN 94 / Fugitive Botnar paid Pounds 3.8m - up 2,831%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Octav Botnar, the chairman of Nissan UK for whom an arrest warrant has
been outstanding for the past two-and-a-half years, was paid Pounds 3.81m
last year.
The emoluments - representing a 2,831 per cent rise from his previous year's
pay of Pounds 130,000 - were for his role as chairman of Automotive
Financial Group Holdings, which owns AFG, one of the UK's biggest motor
dealers.
Of the total remuneration, Pounds 3.7m is described as a 'bonus' paid by
AFG. The figures appear in the latest annual report filed by AFGH for the
year to July 1993. During the year AFGH's pre-tax profits fell by 73 per
cent to Pounds 11m, from Pounds 40.5m. Turnover was down 23 per cent at
Pounds 419.9m.
An arrest warrant was issued in January 1992 for Mr Botnar, 80, who is
alleged to have been the principal conspirator in the largest corporation
tax fraud in UK history. The Inland Revenue was cheated of Pounds 55m by
Nissan UK, the Botnar subsidiary which had imported and distributed Nissan
cars until Nissan took over the role itself.
In the most recent information filed at Companies House, Mr Botnar's 'usual
residential address' is listed as Columbia Drive, Worthing, West Sussex, the
headquarters of AFGH. He has failed to return to the UK for two-and-a-half
years, preferring to live in Switzerland in a villa near Geneva.
During his absence, two of his former colleagues have been jailed for their
part in the fraud. Mr Michael Hunt, former Nissan UK managing director, was
sentenced last summer to eight years and last month lost an appeal against
conviction and sentence. Since he went to prison, Mr Hunt has become
eligible to receive Pounds 1.06m as his latest dividend payment on his 10.6
per cent stake in AFGH.
The Inland Revenue is seeking repayment of up to Pounds 238m from Nissan UK,
which it claims is the company's tax liability for a period of 17 years in
which it alleges that the company's profits were understated.
Nissan UK has appealed against the tax assessment, and this appeal is
expected to be heard by the Special Commissioners of the Inland Revenue
later this year.
The ultimate parent company of AFGH is the Bahamas-based GF International
Finance and Investments, while Nissan UK Holdings' ultimate parent is the
Panama-based European Motor Vehicles Corporation. Mr Botnar is chairman of
both companies.

FT  15 JUN 94 / Acquisitions help to push Unigate forward
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unigate, the food and distribution group, continued its rehabilitation with
a 15.9 per cent rise in profits before exceptionals and tax to Pounds
113.5m, and a 7.5 per cent increase in the annual dividend.
The shares gained 22p to close at 384p yesterday.
Acquisitions, notably of Clifford Foods and Glass Glover, were largely
behind the profits rise, with about Pounds 3m of the pre-tax profit coming
from a 53rd trading week and another Pounds 1m from sterling's weakness.
Turnover was Pounds 1.98bn, against Pounds 1.93bn.
Mr Ross Buckland, chief executive, said the year had seen significant
progress in reshaping the group. In the three years since he joined, Unigate
has made acquisitions totalling Pounds 201m and disposals of Pounds 189m. In
the year to March 31, purchases totalled Pounds 121m and sales Pounds
104.2m.
Mr Buckland said there were still significant deals to be done, although
poor trading would probably prevent the intended flotation of the US
restaurant business for another year.
Rationalisation following the dairy acquisitions allowed the group to
increase milk volumes by a third without extra capacity, lifting operating
profits in the division by 40 per cent to Pounds 42.5m. Even so, Mr Buckland
said, return on supplying milk to supermarkets was still too low to justify
the investment Unigate was making in the business. He predicted a milk price
rise following the end of the Milk Marketing Board, scheduled for November
1, but 'not of such an order of magnitude that would cause consumers to
switch from buying milk and milk-based products to other products'.
Fresh food operating profits rose 34 per cent to Pounds 26.2m and
distribution profits were 38 per cent higher at Pounds 22.5m, thanks to a
full-year contribution from Glass Glover.
Mr John Worby, finance director, said operating profits from continuing
operations, up 13.6 per cent to Pounds 97.6m, showed a good performance in
difficult trading conditions. Acquisitions contributed another Pounds 9.9m.
Associates, mainly the Dutch Nutricia business, made Pounds 14.9m, up from
Pounds 14.4m.
An exceptional debit of Pounds 11.1m, against a credit of Pounds 3.5m,
reflected a loss on disposals partly offset by release of provisions.
Interest charges rose Pounds 3.6m to Pounds 13m with year-end debt at Pounds
118.9m, up Pounds 20.7m and giving gearing of 36 per cent.
Earnings per share were 31.4p (31.3p) but adjusting for the exceptionals
they were up 18.8 per cent to 35.4p. A final dividend of 11.3p gives a total
of 17.3p (16.1p).

FT  15 JUN 94 / Enterprise Oil raises bid but shuns cash: Shareholders
remain wary of unusual structure - Target's price declines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Enterprise Oil yesterday raised the stakes in its hostile bid for rival
explorer Lasmo with a final all-share offer valuing the target at Pounds
1.59bn.
It was clear from the revised terms and lack of a cash element that
Enterprise had been under pressure from its shareholders not to push its
terms too far.
Enterprise is seeking to win over Lasmo's hesitant shareholders by doubling
the promised dividend, allowing them a greater share of the enlarged company
and offering earlier conversion dates for the A shares and warrants which
make up the unusually structured equity offer. Based on an Enterprise share
price of 399p, Lasmo shares were valued at 165p, against last night's close
of 143 1/2 p - the day's 4p fall indicated scepticism about prospects of the
bid's success. After a 9p drop in Enterprise's shares, the offer was worth
about 161p.
Mr Graham Hearne, Enterprise's chief executive, said the revised offer
represented fair value for shareholders in both companies. 'We haven't used
buckets of cash, we haven't underwritten the shares, we are confident this
will win it.'
Lasmo's shareholders were less enthusiastic, given the absence of cash and
Enterprise's decision to retain the unusual structure. 'It smacks of
short-term financial engineering,' said one institutional investor. 'They
are finding it difficult to convince people of the strategic merits.'
Enterprise's institutional investors are also believed to be unenthusiastic.
They fear significant earnings dilution and short-term effects on the share
price.
Analysts said the market was expecting Enterprise's revised offer to fail.
'People do not like the complexity of the bid and would have been much
happier with a cash alternative,' one analyst said.
Mr Rudolf Agnew, Lasmo's chairman, said the revised bid remained unwelcome.
'The share of the combined company is totally inadequate and it continues to
be in junk paper,' he said.
Enterprise is offering 36 A shares and 13 warrants for every 88 of Lasmo's,
valuing the target's shares at 165p on an Enterprise price of 399p. This
compares with 27 A shares and 12 warrants for every 80 Lasmo in the original
offer. Lasmo investors would hold 44.5 per cent of the enlarged company,
against 40 per cent.
The A shares would carry dividends of 6p in 1994 and 1995, against 3p in the
three years to 1996. This equals 2p per Lasmo share, against the target's
promised minimum of 1p. The warrants' strike price has been improved to 430p
against 470p. Lex, Page 22

was thrown open again yesterday when a High Court judge released the
company's trustees from any obligation to sell their shares to Hasbro, the
US toy group.
The judge ruled that Mattel, a rival US toy company, had acted properly in
announcing an improved offer five minutes before the deadline for the
operation of a clause allowing the trustees to be released from an
irrevocable undertaking to sell a controlling interest to Hasbro.
The court's decision now leaves the Spear trustees - who own 24.9 per cent
of the company - free to accept the Mattel bid or any higher one.
Hasbro was last night considering its options: to mount an appeal against
the ruling, out-bid Mattel, or walk away. The company is certain to reach
its decision before Thursday, after which an undertaking given yesterday by
the trustees not to sell their shares to anyone else will expire.
The dispute arose after the Spear trustees gave irrevocable undertakings on
May 27 to accept a Pounds 46.9m bid from Hasbro which, with 26.7 per cent,
has been the largest shareholder outside the Spear family for the past four
years. However, Mattel responded with a Pounds 52m bid. This was announced
at five minutes to midnight on June 2, the final day when the escape clause
applied to allow the trustees to accept higher bids.
The legal action centred on whether Mattel had fulfilled its obligations to
make a public announcement of its offer. Mattel had informed the Stock
Exchange and the Takeover Panel in the minutes leading up to the final
deadline, but not the national press.
Lawyers for Hasbro argued that the offer should also have been announced to
at least two national newspapers and two UK wire services.
Giving judgment, Mr Justice Chadwick said that when the escape clause was
agreed between Hasbro and the trustees, it was likely that their intention
was to guarantee the commitment of third-party bidders rather than informing
the investing public.
Spear, its trustees and Mattel welcomed yesterday's outcome.

FT  15 JUN 94 / German monetary drag on bond markets' anchor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Europe has been to the polls, but as far as the European capital markets are
concerned the problem seems to be that international investors are voting
with their feet. German bonds, the bedrock of the European securities
structure, have had a terrible year, with the 10-year government bond yield
now up to 7 per cent, from 5 1/2 per cent at the beginning of January. Other
bond markets may have performed more badly, but in less than six months
bunds have lost all the gains of the previous 12.
Unlike their US and Japanese counterparts, the European equity markets have
not been able to brush aside the weakness in bonds, so that in local
currency the Europe index is down 6 per cent against only about 1 per cent
for Wall Street and the rogue 17 per cent gain in Japan. The indices in
France, Germany and the UK are all down by between 7 and 10 per cent.
European currencies have held their own against a weak dollar which still
offers a lower short-term interest rate, but they have slipped by around 3
per cent this year against the yen.
A basic factor behind all this is the loss of monetary control by the German
Bundesbank. Only last week the world's top central bankers were in London
celebrating the rare peak of their power and influence, but markets often
cynically sell into signs of hubris. Sturdily independent the Buba may be,
but it is floundering in a sea of M3 bank deposits, up an annualised 15 per
cent so far this year compared with a target growth range of 4 to 6 per
cent. Since the beginning of 1992, German M3 has risen by 24 per cent, twice
as fast as if the central targets had been hit.
At least the surprisingly strong performance by the Christian Democratic
Union in the European parliamentary elections, with positive implications
for Mr Helmut Kohl's chances in the domestic poll next October, may soothe
fears that the Bundesbank will continue to bend over backwards to help the
government. All the same, the Bundesbank's apparent willingness to take
inflationary risks through surprisingly aggressive rate-cutting, and
measures to support the dollar, has upset the bond markets.
It may all, of course, turn out to be an unimportant technical tangle, a
shift in velocity best left to academic monetarists. The expansion of the
D-Mark area into east Germany and (unofficially) beyond may have invalidated
past trend lines, and furthermore the speculative bubble in global bonds
last year priced bunds out of the reach of domestic investors. Foreign
investors and banks bought the German bond issue in 1993, with domestic
non-bank investors notable for their absence.
At the end of last year the wholesale money market rate on three-month
D-Marks was 30 basis points higher than on 10-year bonds. Hence the pile-up
of savings in deposits which are included in M3. This year's drastic
measures to turn the yield curve around should cause those savings to shift
longer, once investors have lost their fear of further price falls in bonds;
even now, however, bond yields are short of their long-run average of some
7.5 per cent. Meanwhile the gamble is that lower short-term rates will not
set off a renewed growth in credit - at a time when the German economy is
starting to pull quite decisively out of recession.
The Bundesbank Central Council will meet for a mid-year monetary target
review on July 21. Hardliners are bound to fear that the protracted period
of double-digit monetary expansion is inevitably going to lead to currency
weakness and, within two or three years, to rising inflation. In the
immediate future, however, German inflation may be about to dip below 3 per
cent.
For global investors it must be worrying that the European Union should be
in danger of losing its financial anchor at a time when the weekend poll
showed signs of political fragmentation in France, not to mention continued
waywardness in the UK.
The recession and falling interest rates last year covered up the financial
pressures in Europe but economic recovery will prove testing. Already the
bond markets have seen significant divergence, with spreads against bunds
widening for UK and Spanish government bonds, for instance. But the
uncertainty has spread right to the heart of the European capital markets.

FT  15 JUN 94 / Clinton outlines Dollars 9.3bn plan to reform welfare
programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton yesterday outlined a reform package intended to turn
the US social safety net into 'a paycheque, not a welfare cheque'.
The reform proposals, expected to cost about Dollars 9.3bn (Pounds 6.2bn)
over five years, are intended to expand education, training and childcare
for the poor. But they are also aimed at those who have received welfare
benefits for more than two years. Such recipients would enrol on a work
programme in return for payments.
Presenting his plan in Kansas City, Mr Clinton said: 'We propose to offer
people on welfare a simple contract: we will help you get the skills you
need, but after two years, anyone who can go to work must go to work - in
the private sector if possible, in a subsidised job if necessary, but work
is preferable to welfare and it must be enforced.'
A relatively modest portion of the US social safety net would be affected by
the proposals, which are an attempt by Mr Clinton to keep his 1992 campaign
promise to 'end welfare as we know it'.
The main target is Aid to Families with Dependent Children, a programme for
parents with young children. It is virtually the only federal government
programme paying cash benefits to healthy people who have exhausted their
unemployment benefits or have never held a job.
AFDC pays an average of Dollars 376.88 a month to about 5m families,
depending on how much each state pays to supplement the federal portion.
Under the plan, anyone who has turned down a job or has not made adequate
efforts to look for work could have payments halted.
The reforms will affect recipients born after 1971. The White House
estimated that by 2000, fewer than one welfare recipient in 12 would be
enrolled in the mandatory work programmes. However, the scope of the
programme, likely to be substantially changed in Congress, has already been
halved. That is because US budget rules require additional spending on areas
such as welfare to be offset by higher taxes or by cuts in other such
programmes. Mr Clinton has ruled out higher taxes.
Mr Clinton's pledges on welfare during his election campaign helped to label
him as a 'new kind of Democrat' and win back some of the middle-class voters
who had deserted his party for former president Ronald Reagan.
But welfare reform has been postponed again and again to leave room on the
congressional agenda for the more ambitious reform of the healthcare system.
There have been many suggestions in Washington that the timing of
publication of the reform plan has been influenced by the desire to appease
Senator Daniel Moynihan, the chairman of the Senate finance committee, seen
as crucial to Mr Clinton's healthcare plan.

FT  15 JUN 94 / Big fall in construction orders: Retail sales growth
slackened in May, CBI survey shows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR and GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The uneven pace of Britain's economic recovery was highlighted yesterday by
a marked decline in construction orders in the three months to April, and
signs of an unexpectedly subdued growth of retail sales in May.
A big fall in British construction orders for road, rail and other
infrastructure projects this spring has prompted concern that the pace of
the building and civil engineering recovery may be starting to slow as
public spending cuts begin to take effect.
At the same time, the Confederation of British Industry's latest survey of
distributive trades showed a drop in the numbers of retailers reporting year
on year growth of sales in May compared with April.
The fall disappointed City analysts, who expected the survey to show a
continuation of April's strong sales growth.
But the CBI pointed out there was little sign that the tax increases in
April had significantly dented consumer demand. Economists are awaiting news
today of last month's unemployment trends and tomorrow's official retail
sales data to establish the state of the recovery.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, will outline in his Mansion House speech
tonight how he hopes to maintain steady growth with low inflation.
Figures published yesterday by the Environment Department showed that the
value of infrastructure orders at constant 1990 prices fell by 39 per cent
during the three months to the end of April compared with the previous three
months.
Infrastructure orders also were a sixth lower than during the corresponding
period last year.
Construction orders overall fell by 14 per cent compared with the previous
three months although they remained 6 per cent higher than during the
corresponding period in 1993.
More encouraging were rises in private industrial and commercial orders
which increased by 16 per cent and 26 per cent respectively compared with a
year ago.
Private housing orders were also 17 per cent higher than a year ago although
3 per cent lower than during the previous three months - providing further
evidence of a recent wobble in the housing market recovery previously
reported by building societies and estate agents.
A sharp decline in infrastructure orders had been expected following the
bunching of large contracts placed for the Jubilee Line extension towards
the end of last year.
The fall, however, was greater than expected according to the Federation of
Civil Engineering Contractors which said it 'had not expected the
year-on-year decline to reach double figures'.
Road orders in current prices fell by 18 per cent to Pounds 470m compared
with the previous three months. Orders worth Pounds 69m in April were the
lowest monthly total since June last year.

FT  15 JUN 94 / Foreign investment in China slows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China's foreign investment surge appears to be slowing, after a year of
hectic growth when the contracted value of new agreements exceeded the total
invested during the 14 years of Beijing's market reforms.
The state administration for industry and commerce (SAIC) said yesterday
that the number of newly established foreign-funded enterprises was down by
43.6 per cent to 10,739 in the first quarter, compared with the same period
last year.
There was also a 50 per cent drop in both newly pledged foreign investment
and in funds used, the official China Daily reported. Detailed figures were
not made available. Mr Hou Lin, head of the state office's register of new
foreign-funded enterprises, attributed the marked slowdown in new ventures
to changes in the tax law which reduced preferential treatment.
In the past, thousands of joint ventures were established to enable the
partners to import duty-free cars. This privilege was suspended last year.
Other factors included tighter credit policies in China itself - aimed at
calming an overheating economy - and competition for foreign investment from
neighbouring Asian countries.
China's gross national product in 1993 grew by 13 per cent. This compares
with 12.8 per cent in 1992. The authorities are seeking to slow the economy
to 9 per cent growth this year.
While the number of new joint ventures decreased in the first quarter by
about 50 per cent, numbers of wholly foreign-owned companies grew by 6 per
cent.
Foreign-contracted investment in China surged last year to 83,000 projects
valued at Dollars 111bn (Pounds 74bn). Actual utilised investment reached
Dollars 25.8bn, an increase of 134 per cent over the year before. The state
administration reported that there were 167,000 foreign-funded businesses in
China by the end of last year. Hong Kong accounts for about two-thirds of
the investment, but a new trend involves the US, Japan and South Korea in a
number of large projects.

FT  15 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Severn Trent
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
For all its adventures in waste management, Severn Trent has outperformed
the sector due to its attractions as a utility. The water business was
endowed with cash at privatisation and has been well managed since then.
Capital expenditure was skewed towards the early years, which allowed the
company to benefit from low construction costs during recession. Investment
spending last year was Pounds 25m less than budgeted as a result. Despite
losing business from British Coal, the impact of recession on turnover has
been generally less severe than in regions such as Anglian.
Such considerations have outweighed the drag from Biffa, the waste business
bought for Pounds 212m three years ago. The quality of Biffa has rarely been
questioned, even if the price Severn Trent paid for it has. As Biffa's
operating performance improves, the drag on earnings should lessen. Still,
it will be some years before the waste side is covering the financing costs
of the acquisition. A Pounds 4.7m loss on international business hardly
instills confidence in other non-utility activities.
But the merits of Severn Trent's water business show no sign of diminishing.
Capital spending through the second half of the decade should be low
relative to cash flow, so the company should end up less heavily geared than
many of its peers. High dividend cover also points to flexibility on the
pay-out. If Severn Trent can avoid embarrassments elsewhere, the utility
looks well positioned to shine.

FT  15 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Unigate
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The 6 per cent jump in Unigate's shares after yesterday's full-year results
suggests the 7.5 per cent increase in the dividend came as a pleasant
surprise. Dividend growth is accelerating after three years of flat payouts
at the start of the decade. That might signal success for the restructuring
undertaken by Mr Ross Buckland, the chief executive, at what had become an
unfocused conglomerate. Look deeper, though, and doubts about long term
growth remain. Moreover Unigate is hardly a cash cow. Free cash flow before
acquisitions was not quite enough to cover the dividend.
Admittedly, this reflects an abnormally high interest payment and a healthy
increase in capital expenditure. It also underlines that Mr Buckland's
success partly reflects his knack of selling peripheral businesses on high
multiples, buying dairies on low multiples and rationalising them at some
cost to increase throughput at existing plant. As long as margin pressure on
dairy products continues - and there is no guarantee that looming changes to
the milk marketing regime will bring relief - this is a sensible strategy.
But it requires scope for shuffling group assets.
Happily, Unigate still has a trump card in its stake in Nutricia of Holland
which is worth around Pounds 200m but contributes less than Pounds 4m in
dividends to group cash flow. Were the stake sold and the proceeds
reinvested, both cash flow and earnings would be enhanced. That would secure
a further dividend progression, but it would be a poor substitute for a real
improvement in dairy market conditions.

FT  15 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Enterprise/Lasmo
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
On the face of it, yesterday's fall in Lasmo's share price suggests that
Enterprise's improved bid is expected to fail. If it were thought likely to
succeed, Lasmo's share price would not stand at a 10 per cent discount to
the value of the all-paper offer. Arbitrage would close the gap, either by
pushing up Lasmo's share price or by driving down Enterprise's.
But it is still early days and it would be a mistake to write off
Enterprise's chances entirely. Lasmo shareholders will have to think hard
before dismissing the offer. On the positive side, the new terms amount to
offering Lasmo investors a 44.5 per cent share of the combined group. That
compares with the 40 per cent offered in the original bid. Though
independent analysts have different views about the relative asset values of
the two companies, 44.5 per cent is at the top of the range.
Enterprise will have its work cut out to persuade investors of the bid's
merits. Lasmo shareholders will need good reasons why they should surrender
paper in a company which is recovering from years of poor management and is
highly geared to movements in crude prices. Moreover, overhanging the whole
bid is Enterprise's inability to demonstrate any added value from putting
the two companies together. That means either Lasmo's shareholders or
Enterprise's look like suffering if the bid succeeds, and perhaps both.

FT  15 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Sprint for the line
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is becoming something of a tradition for European telecom operators to
pay fancy prices for minority stakes in their US counterparts. BT started
the trend with its Dollars 4.3bn investment in MCI last year. Deutsche
Telekom and France Telecom are following suit with their Dollars 4.2bn
investment in Sprint. It is a mark of the relative dynamism of US operators
that European groups have to bribe them to become partners in global
alliances.
As well as negotiating a good price, Sprint has been able to clinch a
central role in the new alliance. It will own half the alliance's global
network, despite being smaller than either partner. Sprint will also have
total responsibility for marketing the partnership's services within the US,
a third share in European markets outside France and Germany, and a half
share in the rest of the world.
Whether this will be sufficient to win over US regulatory authorities is
unclear. The argument that foreign state-owned monopolies should not be
allowed to compete in the US could strike chords with the Clinton
administration. Approval may be contingent on the French and Germans opening
their own markets to competition.
Rival groups are unlikely to wait for regulatory decisions before planning
their responses. AT&amp;T may well formalise its association with Unisource, an
alliance of Swiss, Dutch and Swedish operators. BT will redouble efforts to
woo Japan's NTT as well as seeking to build up its position in continental
Europe. That leaves Cable &amp; Wireless looking like the odd man out. It has
opted to provide global services through its existing 'federation' of
operators. But what it possesses in geographic reach, it lacks in financial
muscle.

When John Harris retired unexpectedly early from the chairmanship of East
Midlands Electricity earlier this year, it had been thought that he could at
least look forward to the chairmanship of the Coal Authority - which the
government had indicated was his for the taking.
However, Harris's reputation, once among the highest in the industry, has
taken a bit of hammering following revelations about the problems East
Midlands has had with some of its post-privatisation acquisitions. Indeed,
it seems that the government is now looking for someone else to head the
organisation which will supervise the licensing of pits and their

Talking of dogs, what do we make of Labour MP Ken Livingstone's support for
the 'Scoop that poop' campaign which he helped launch in Battersea Park last
weekend?
The aim is to 'persuade owners to clear up after Britain's 7.5m dogs' and
the sponsors, dog-food manufacturers James Wellbeloved &amp; Co, wanted a tame
MP to pose for the cameras, because fouling by dogs is an issue upon which
MPs receive more mail than any other.
Another sign, perhaps, that the Labour leftwinger is not taking seriously
his other campaign - to collect colleagues' signatures for his candidacy in
Labour's leadership race?

For the four new MPs who took their seats in the House of Commons, yesterday
should have been their special day. But their arrival in the chamber was
upstaged by the entry of another newcomer - Lucy, David Blunkett's new guide
dog.
As Labour's health spokesman entered a packed chamber for prime minister's
questions, the 21-month old Labrador slowly led her master towards the
government benches. Pandemonium ensued as her master was hauled back across
the floor of the House by anxious colleagues. Said a Blunkett aide: 'Lucy
can only have assumed that our performance in the European elections was so
good that we had taken power.'

Winning the right to host the 2000 Olympics Games was obviously the easy bit
for Sydney - getting someone to run the damn thing is the tricky part.
The Sydney Olympics Games Committee brought in two firms of headhunters to
help choose the games' chief executive. But SOGOC is covered in
embarrassment. Its (un-named) second-choice candidate has pulled out, just
hours before the appointment was due to be announced. The first choice also
withdrew, some time ago.
The sticking-point is - wouldn't you believe it? - money. This time round,
the ADollars 400,000-a-year salary was quickly topped by the candidate's
existing employer. Gary Pemberton, the Qantas boss who heads SOGOC, says
everything now goes back to square one - meaning, in all likelihood, another
eight-month delay.
Should be a close finish.

Denmark's most celebrated unmarried couple have at last tied the knot. Prime
Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, Social Democratic party leader, and Lone
Dybkjaer, a leading light in the Radical Liberal party, have been living in
unmarried bliss for the past two years. That raises not an eyebrow in
tolerant Denmark, where more than a third of cohabiting couples are
unmarried.
Rasmussen and Dybkjaer married in secret in May, in the midst of
tough-fought European parliamentary elections. Dybkjaer triumphed in the
vote; she achieved the second-highest personal score, with 159,552 votes,
and won her party's first Strasbourg seat. Rasmussen fared less well. His
party's vote fell to a miserable 15.8 per cent, from 23.3 per cent in 1989
and 37.4 per cent in the last election to the Danish parliament itself.
A former environment minister, Dybkjaer's connection with Rasmussen kept her
out of the current Radical party/Social Democrat coalition government. On
present form, she might be keeping Rasmussen out in future.

FT  15 JUN 94 / Leading Article: Bad start for Railtrack
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Today's one-day rail dispute in the UK is an inconvenience for millions of
people who rely on rail transport, and an unwelcome reminder of the bad old
days. It is more than an inconvenience for Railtrack, the state-owned
company set up in April to run British Rail's track and signalling
operations as it is privatised.
In its first few months of existence, it needs to win the confidence of its
customers and conclude dozens of deals with the train-operating companies
and the track maintenance companies. A one-day strike of Railtrack's
signalling staff, with the promise of more to come, is an inauspicious
start.
Further, with its own privatisation hoped for before the next election,
Railtrack is caught in a bind. It wants to keep down its wage costs to
maximise its sale price, but if it continues with its hard line against the
RMT rail union it will face a growing bill for compensation from track users
unable to run trains.
Railtrack is not blameless for the current mess, which involves a pay claim
going back seven years. It appears to have indicated that it was ready to
offer an interim pay deal to signals staff, before withdrawing the offer and
saying that an offer would only be made at the conclusion of productivity
talks.
The union, however, must take most of the blame for today's events.
Railtrack accepts the logic of a catch-up payment for signals staff. But
union members are demanding some of that money now - and without a link to
productivity changes. To strike for such a deal is more than premature: it
is irresponsibly exploiting Railtrack's vulnerability at a delicate stage in
its development.
More than 100 years of adversarial industrial relations on the railways will
not disappear overnight. But now that the railway system is being exposed to
market forces, the new rail managers are under even greater pressure to
manage change without industrial conflict. They cannot do that with a
trigger-happy RMT.

FT  15 JUN 94 / Personal View: Dividends are only part of the story
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HOWARD DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Remarks by Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, to the
Confederation of British Industry last month criticising UK companies'
dividend policy have certainly set the cat among pigeons. Perhaps the
conclusion the chancellor will draw is that Treasury ministers would do well
to remain decently veiled throughout the year, not just at Budget time.
If so, that would be a pity, because Mr Dorrell did ask some interesting
questions, which deserve a serious response. Does the rise in dividend
payouts matter? Has it affected companies' ability to invest profitably? Is
the corporate tax and regulatory framework still appropriate?
Business investment in the UK has indeed been too low. Fixed investment as a
share of gross domestic product has been below the levels achieved by
Britain's main competitors over the last 10 years. The UK average has been
17.5 per cent, compared with a European Union average of 19.7 per cent and
an OECD average of 20.4 per cent.
The main reason for companies' unwillingness to invest - certainly the one
they give in response to our surveys - is that they are uncertain about
future demand. Of course uncertainty is a fact of business life, but in the
UK it appears to have been magnified by government policy errors. So the
government's main response to the problems Mr Dorrell identifies should be
to maintain a stable macroeconomic and financial environment.
The behaviour of long-term interest rates in recent months suggests the
market still lacks confidence in the authorities' ability to meet inflation
targets in the upturn, perhaps because the government has only gone half way
towards creating an independent and accountable Bank of England. Making an
honest woman of Bank governor Mr Eddie George should be high on the
Treasury's agenda.
But the amounts and types of finance available are also relevant, however
stable the inflationary environment. Our research shows that, over the
medium term, there is a close link between the trends in business saving
(retained profits) and investment. So it is reasonable to explore how
retained profits might be increased. The best answer is increased
profitability. UK companies' profitability has been lower than that of some
competitors - the return on capital in the business sector in 1980-91 was,
at 9.7 per cent a year, 3 points or more below rates in the US, Japan,
Germany or France.
Then there is the tax system. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has argued
that the reform of the corporation tax system in the mid-1980s - which
reduced both capital allowances and corporation tax - although intended to
be fiscally neutral, increased the user cost of capital. That points to the
need for either reduced rates of corporation tax, or increased capital
allowances.
Dividend payouts - which also, of course, reduce retained earnings - are
very delicate territory, as Mr Dorrell has discovered. One false move could
send actuarial deficits in pension schemes soaring, requiring increased
company contributions, offsetting any cashflow benefit from lower payouts.
The first point to note is that, while payout ratios have risen, so have
amounts raised through rights issues and flotations. So - certainly for
large companies - financial markets are performing as they should, requiring
managements to justify calls for funds, and recycling money to companies
which have attractive opportunities.
But smaller companies wonder whether the market knows enough about their
investment opportunities to add value to their decisions, and argue that the
costs of raising equity are too large. The government has already produced
part of the answer to that problem with its Enterprise Investment Scheme and
Venture Capital Trust proposal.
Another constructive change might be to allow the costs of equity raising
against tax. And the Treasury might also focus on the operation of the
capital taxation regime. The capital gains tax rate is too high; it
discriminates against direct equity investment and hinders the effective
operation of the equity market. Among the many possible reforms the
chancellor might consider is to taper the rate on realised gains in line
with the length of time the amount was held. Over time that would reward
relationship investors and encourage tax-paying institutions to take a
long-term view. It is an idea the Labour party favours, which ought not to
be allowed to rule it out.
Rates of dividend payout are only part of the story. Mr Dorrell would
therefore do well to downplay this and begin instead to develop a broader
agenda of corporate tax reform.

FT  15 JUN 94 / More strategy, less small print: European Union leaders
should concentrate on leading, not on following every shift in public
opinion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For politicians and political analysts, election results are irresistible.
Even when the direct consequences are insignificant and the turnout low, you
still get a much bigger sample of public opinion than in any mere opinion
poll.
So we eagerly weigh the results of last weekend's elections to see whether
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl is now sure of re-election in October, or
whether UK Prime Minister John Major can survive. Fair enough, so long as
one remembers that many more people will vote in national elections, and
that those who did vote would not necessarily vote the same way if they were
choosing a government.
Since they were actually choosing a European Parliament, and since the
results were released in all 12 European Union member states on the same
day, it is even more tempting to draw conclusions about the political future
of Europe as a whole. More tempting, but also more hazardous. The low
turnout suggests that many voters either had no strong feelings on
pan-European issues, or were not convinced that this election offered an
effective way to express those feelings. Among those who did turn out,
significant minorities in France and Denmark voted for lists whose main
plank was opposition to the Maastricht treaty. Elsewhere, the vast majority
voted for candidates whose position on European issues was only one feature,
and usually not the most prominent, in their general political profile.
The parliament itself may be less single-minded, and therefore less
effective in seeking a further increase in its own powers, than was its
predecessor. But its views on that subject tend in any case to be discounted
by governments, which still wield most of the real power. More significant
will be the French prime minister's need to look over his shoulder at Mr
Philippe de Villiers, the Euro-sceptic leader whose supporters will have to
be wooed by anyone hoping to be the standard-bearer of the right in next
year's presidential election. And all 12 governments, in preparing their
positions for the 1996 Maastricht revision conference, will have to bear in
mind the extreme difficulty of winning the Danish electorate's assent to new
measures of European integration - though after the gruelling saga of
Maastricht ratification, they should hardly need reminding of that.
Public opinion within the EU is clearly going to be an important factor in
determining its future, and the Maastricht saga well illustrates the perils
of neglecting it. But the task of European leaders in the next few years is
not to respond slavishly to every perceived shift in public opinion, but
rather to use the institutions of the EU, and to adapt them where necessary,
to deal with problems that call for a common European response. If they do
this, and if they can show clearly that this is what they are doing, they
should not find it too difficult to carry public opinion with them.
What are those problems? It is almost a knee-jerk response to say that the
first and direst is unemployment. High unemployment is indeed something of a
European disease, but it is not certain that the remedies for it are best
adopted at the EU level. Most of the suggestions in the recent Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and Development report on the subject are still
within the competence of member states. Consensus on the precise policy mix
will be hard to achieve, and there is a lot to be said for letting
individual states experiment with different approaches, and learn from each
other's successes and failures, so long as these different approaches do not
constitute non-tariff barriers to trade or to the free movement of capital
and labour.
The contribution the EU can make to reducing unemployment lies precisely in
demolishing such barriers, and preventing new ones from being erected.
Internally, it must preserve and improve the single market. Externally it
must build on the success of the Uruguay Round, and above all encourage the
growth of central and east European economies, where geography should give
an edge to west European exporters and investors over their global
competitors. Expanding its market to include central and eastern Europe is
clearly in the EU's economic interest, even if there are short-term costs
such as accelerated job losses in so-called 'sensitive' sectors, meaning
those where the west European workforce is anyway shrinking rapidly.
As with employment, so with the environment. Some aspects of the problem can
best be dealt with at national or even sub-national level, others on the
scale of the planet. But there is an obvious task for the EU in preserving
natural resources which are used by residents of more than one member state,
and in combating pollution which spills across state frontiers. That also
implies planning the transcontinental infrastructure, especially the
transport networks, in ways which preserve rural tranquillity as far as
possible. At present the EU is perceived by public opinion in many member
states as eco-hostile, not least because of the incentives it gives to
maximise agricultural productivity with intensive use of chemical
fertilisers and pesticides, and with little concern either for the quality
of the product or for the effect on the countryside. That can, and should,
be changed.
But probably the EU's most urgent task lies in the area of security.
Conventional British wisdom has it that security should be left to Nato, and
that for the EU to meddle in it would risk weakening the all-important link
with the US. That wisdom is out of date. President Bill Clinton, during his
D-day tour of Europe, positively egged on the creation of separate European
defence structures. He promised that the US would 'remain engaged' in Europe
and honour its Nato commitments, but added: 'We also want Europe to be
strong. That is why America supports Europe's own steps so far toward
greater unity - the European Union, the Western European Union and the
development of a European defence identity.'
There is an important subtext here. Mr Clinton was elected to give priority
to US domestic problems and economic interests, and if anything his
determination to do that has been strengthened by the vicissitudes of the
last year. His 'presidential decision' on multilateral peace operations,
issued last month after a full year's gestation, sets tight limits on the
operations the US will support and even tighter ones on those it will
participate in.
In Europe, Mr Clinton claims to be committed to deploy ground troops in
Bosnia, but only after a full peace agreement is reached, and if Congress
agrees. Likewise he claims to be committed to expansion of Nato eastwards,
but at some unspecified date in the future. For today there is only
'security co-operation everywhere in Europe'. Unless Russia begins again to
look seriously aggressive, that will not mean much more than joint military
exercises.
His message to Europe is very clear, and can be paraphrased thus: 'If you
are attacked, we are still with you. But for the moment, thanks to our past
efforts, you are not in danger and we have other fish to fry. For God's sake
organise yourselves, bring central Europe within your fold while the going
is good, and deal with the problems on your frontiers so that Europe does
not again become a major worry for us. We will give you logistical and air
support, but we will not expose our troops to casualties on the ground.'
That is the agenda Europe has to deal with in the next few years. To do so
effectively will require a pooling of sovereignty in the very sensitive
areas of defence and foreign policy - for which, according to today's
wisdom, public opinion is not ready. Yet it is a task which should be much
easier to explain to public opinion than the need to standardise electric
sockets, or to spray fields with weedkiller to prevent anything growing in
them. If the EU had been able to save Bosnia, its citizens would have a
clearer idea of what it was for.

FT  15 JUN 94 / Leading Article: Student vouchers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In the past five years, the proportion of 18-year-olds going into higher
education in the UK has doubled, an expansion in student numbers widely seen
as essential for improving the country's competitiveness. Yet this enormous
expansion has taken place within a framework of higher education largely
designed in the last century to educate a much smaller elite. It is not
surprising, therefore, that the system is coming under strain.
Chief among those pressures is funding, made more acute by the UK tradition
that the state pays most of the cost. The government's solution has been to
avoid increasing funds to match the rise in student numbers. Universities
have been able to improve productivity, but much of the saving has been at
the expense of straining university staff and facilities, if not at the
expense of quality. A further squeeze is planned.
Such measures are inevitably short-term in scope and arbitrary in
consequence. University vice-chancellors and principals have become
increasingly vocal in their protests over shortage of resources. Their
difficulties have been compounded by wild swings in policy. When the
government launched the recent expansion drive, it offered enticing
incentives to those institutions that were most successful in attracting
students. When this worked better than anticipated, the incentives were
hastily reduced.
Universities cannot so easily change direction. A clear course is needed
that allows them to plan development. Their top managers have increasingly
recognised that greater stability would come from breaking the dependence on
funds allocated by the higher education funding councils. Hence the growing
interest in a shift from grants paid by Whitehall to fees paid by or for
students.
The latest manifestation of this is Monday's report of the Higher Education
Quality Council, which monitors the quality of degree courses. Its starting
point is the need for changes to encourage greater flexibility in higher
education. Much-needed measures are proposed to make it easier for students
to move between universities, to work while studying and to re-enter
education after breaks.
The report examines ways to ensure that such measures do not undermine the
quality of higher education. But it goes on to look at how the funding of
students can be reformed to encourage flexibility. The answer is to move to
a 'credit-based formula', or vouchers. Students would be allowed to buy the
education they desire, while universities would be rewarded for their
success in responding to student choice.
The report finds that there is considerable agreement in principle to such a
move. Academic staff are wary of students who make several changes during
their degrees, arguing that institutions can suffer destabilisation. But
many previously opposed to vouchers have been persuaded of the advantages of
a funding system that would be less prey to the judgments of a quango and
the whims of ministers.
That is welcome. Vouchers would also bring many other advantages, including
the opportunity for universities to charge top-up fees. Those that believe
they offer something special should be able to charge more. Individual
students are best placed to judge whether the additional cost is merited.
But the acceptance of the principle of vouchers is only a starting point.
Implementing the policy would involve many awkward questions, including the
value of the voucher and whether it should be the same for all subjects.
Some courses cost more than others - training doctors for example. Then
there is the question of whether the voucher should be worth more for
courses that are considered national priorities, such as science or
engineering. And if students are to pay, a graduate tax would be better than
the current loan scheme.
Perhaps the most difficult questions to be faced, however, are those
confronting the politicians. Free higher education is a highly-valued
component of the middle-class welfare state. Reforms to place more of the
burden on those who benefit from higher education risks their votes. Both
ministers and the opposition have shied away from that prospect. Will they
be able to find the courage now to provide those who run higher education
with a funding system equal to the task of expanding provision without
eroding the quality of one of the UK's most prized assets?

FT  15 JUN 94 / Leading Article: Jumping beans
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Even in world markets every dog has its day. While bonds and equities have
plunged, real assets have staged a striking come back. Yesterday base metals
such as copper and aluminium hit new highs for the year. Others that have
soared in recent weeks and months include coffee, rubber and wool. Oil has
managed a modest uplift. Does this presage a renewed bout of inflation?
It seems unlikely, even though surging commodity prices have often
foreshadowed inflationary problems in the past. There is nothing in the
macro-economic environment to match the explosive growth of foreign exchange
reserves or the oil shocks of the 1970s. Nor is synchronised economic growth
creating excessive pressure on commodity supplies as it did two decades ago.
Since the 1970s the structure of global industry has become less sensitive
to commodity price rises. The use of oil per unit of GDP is reckoned to have
fallen by some 40 per cent and the newer information industries rely on
cheap, light inputs such as silicon more than expensive, heavy metals like
copper. Raw materials account for a low proportion of total costs. There
are, admittedly, new cartel agreements in soft commodities such as coffee.
Yet demand for such products is price-sensitive - hardly a good omen for a
cartel.
In reality, commodity prices are rising from an exceptionally depressed
base. So much the better, since it will prevent producers from closing down
capacity, thereby restricting supply and creating potential bottlenecks. The
surge is a predictable response to the strength of the US recovery. It also
reflects demand from the fast growing Asian economies, including China. And
the hedge funds, gored by the bear market in bonds, have switched their
febrile attention to commod-ities.
Yet gold, which Fed chairman Mr Alan Greenspan admits to watching, has
obdurately failed to levitate, partly because a non-income yielding
investment is expensive to hold when real interest rates are high. This
points to volatility in the course of a cyclical upturn rather than a
sustained, financially-driven bubble. And with competition in retailing in
the developed world still fierce, the recent rise will be felt more in
profit margins than consumer prices. No reason yet to panic over beans,
bellies and barley.

Good judgment undoubtedly played a part. But shareholders in regional
electricity companies in England and Wales would find it hard to deny that
they have been lucky since they bought into the sector four years ago.
London Electricity, which serves the capital, should kick off the results
season today with another set of impressive figures. Its profits performance
has contributed to the shares more than doubling in value since flotation in
1990. In spite of recent falls, they have outperformed the FT-SE-A All-Share
index by 68 per cent during the period.
Back in 1990, the power industry was viewed by the City as a safe but dull
investment. London is not exceptional among power companies, most of which
have performed similarly. East Midlands has outperformed the market by more
than its London counterpart, even though its profits for 1993-94 will be
depressed by Pounds 130m because of poor acquisitions. However, the good
times may be coming to an end.
Professor Stephen Littlechild, the industry regulator, will shortly announce
the results of a review of the pricing regime which helped the regional
companies to make their unexpectedly high profits, and which is now
considered to have been too lenient. He is threatening to be tough;
'draconian', according to industry insiders.
Prof Littlechild is reviewing the distribution prices of the 12 regional
companies and the two Scottish power companies, privatised in 1991.
Distribution accounts for more than 80 per cent of the companies' profits in
England and Wales, and 40 and 20 per cent respectively at Scottish Power and
Scottish Hydro-Electric.
While the review is important both for the companies and the customers, for
whom distribution costs constitute a quarter of their electricity bills, it
also has wider implications. Increasingly, countries from the Pacific Rim to
South America are privatising their utilities. Since the UK has been in the
forefront of transferring electricity, telecommunications and water to the
private sector, its regulation model is studied both for its qualities and
its shortcomings.
The perceived shortcomings have come to notice recently as critics,
including Mr John Baker, chief executive of National Power, the main
electricity generating company, and opposition Labour MPs have pointed to
the idiosyncratic styles of different UK regulators and called for a more
co-ordinated and consistent regime. Prof Littlechild, together with Mr Ian
Byatt, the water regulator, who is conducting a parallel exercise, will thus
be subjected to searching scrutiny in their application of the regulatory
regimes.
Prof Littlechild must tread a fine line: if he is too tough in setting price
targets, he risks the regional electricity companies successfully
challenging his decision through the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. At
the other extreme, less stringent prices could lay him open to charges that
he is favouring already rich companies at the expense of consumers.
In retrospect the controls which have allowed English and Welsh companies
since 1990 to increase distribution prices by an average of 1.1 cent above
inflation every year seem woefully inadequate for an industry which has made
significant cost reductions; even the companies admit privately that they
have had a relatively easy ride.
They deny, however, that they misled the government about what could be
achieved after privatisation. 'No one expected to be able to implement the
kinds of jobs reductions or efficiency improvements which have been
effected,' says one executive. The companies have typically lost more than
20 per cent of staff; Eastern, the largest regional power company in England
and Wales, has cut jobs from 8,770 in March 1990 to 6,500.
Other efficiency measures have included cutting layers of management, more
flexible working, improving purchasing, and setting up business centres
where profits, rather than cost, are the focus. In addition, capital
expenditure has been lighter than expected because of the recession.
The result of these changes and the relaxed price control regime is that the
companies and their shareholders enjoy an embarrassment of riches. For
instance, London Electricity's forecast pretax profits for 1993-94, at
between Pounds 180m and Pounds 190m, compared with just Pounds 126m in the
year before privatisation. This has enabled the company to double dividends
to shareholders from 10.45p per share in 1990-91 to an expected 22.4p for
1993-94.
Similar progress has been made by each of the other 11 regional companies
and, to a lesser extent, the Scottish groups with their tighter price
controls. But the underlying performances of the regional companies may be
even better than the companies are stating publicly. Most of the regional
companies have set aside substantial sums to meet future potential costs
such as redundancy pay and pension provisions.
To charges from consumer groups of profiteering, the companies point out
that customers have also benefited from privatisation. Services have
improved and prices have fallen in real terms for all but the largest
customers. This year domestic tariffs have fallen by 6 per cent in some
areas at a time when most European countries are experiencing price rises.
Consumer groups say the effect of privatisation is less clear-cut since
prices rose prior to 1990 as the government sought to enhance profit levels
and thus make the industry more attractive for investors.
Prof Littlechild's task is to assess how far the division of
post-privatisation spoils needs to be reallocated. The regional companies do
not like the way he is tackling it. Their overriding objection centres on
his definition of capital invested in the businesses. This is crucial
because the price controls which will be set for the next five years will
take into account what he considers to be an adequate rate of return on
capital.
In a letter to the companies he has indicated that he favours a rate of 6
per cent. He has suggested that the definition of capital employed in the
business should be the market capitalisation of the companies about a year
after privatisation. The companies argue that the true figure for capital
employed should be what it would cost them to replace their assets. The
distinction between market value and replacement cost is important to the
companies: the post-privatisation market capitalisation of the sector was
Pounds 8bn, whereas replacing assets could currently cost Pounds 12bn in
total.
It is in the interests of the companies to win as generous a definition as
possible on capital employed. The regulator is suggesting they might earn 6
per cent on a figure less than half that which they estimate is adequate.
Observers suggest that if Prof Littlechild is unwilling to compromise on
this tricky issue, the regional power companies in England and Wales would
be forced to reduce distribution prices next April by up to 20 per cent. He
has indicated that in future years they would be able to raise prices by
inflation minus 4 per cent. In times of low inflation that would mean price
cuts.
While this would disappoint some consumer groups, the regional companies say
they could not tolerate it. 'Right now we think the MMC would give us a
better deal,' one chief executive said yesterday. 'If Prof Littlechild
sticks to his line, the returns for us would be woefully inadequate.' Some
of the companies are already devising strategy for appealing to the
monopolies commission.
Prof Littlechild's review is sure to arouse controversy. But it is likely
that a compromise on price controls will be reached to placate most, and
probably all, the 14 companies. Whether this will satisfy consumer groups,
which feel the utilities have profited at the expense of customers, is
doubtful. Power companies may continue to reap rewards which many consumer
advocates find unacceptable.

FT  15 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: No evidence shown of instability
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From DAVID HARLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, You maintain on your front page of June 14 (international edition) that
governments across Europe have expressed concern 'about the stability of the
European Parliament' after the recent election, but you fail to provide any
serious evidence to substantiate this sweeping and alarmist judgment.
The political forces represented in the new parliament directly reflect
political trends in the member states. The case has yet to be proved that
the emergence of new political groupings, or fragmentation into a
multiplicity of lists such as in France, necessarily leads to 'instability'.
Indeed, instability is more likely to be the cause than the result of this
situation. Democratic societies evolve, as the FT would usually be the first
to point out: parliaments exist to reflect and integrate that evolution.
We were particularly intrigued by your reference to anonymous senior German
officials muttering darkly about 'unpredictable factions' threatening to
disrupt Bonn's relations with the newly elected parliament. No mention, on
the other hand, of the absence from the new parliament of the German
Republikaner, surely an unpredictable faction par excellence, who polled 7.1
per cent in the 1989 European elections but failed to win a single seat this
time round.
Again, your reference to between 80 and 100 MEPs unattached to formal left
or rightwing party groups in the parliament is bordering on the gratuitous.
In all probability new groups and new alliances will be formed in the new
parliament: surely you are not suggesting that there will be 100 unattached
French and Italian MEPs continuously fomenting instability between now and
1999?
We would urge you to eschew dire predictions and instead to judge the
European parliament on its actions over the critical months and years that
lie ahead.

FT  15 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Assurances given for Brixton project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Councillor ANNA TAPSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Considerable concern has been generated since the local elections about
the future of Brixton Challenge, particularly in relation to problems that
could arise in sustaining the council's commitment when no one political
grouping has control.
Your readers will he aware that Sir George Young wrote on May 26 to all
three political group leaders in Lambeth seeking assurances on a number of
matters. Since then all three of us have examined in detail the targets
Brixton Challenge has been set and the level of support that needs to come
from the council to ensure that those targets will be met. To make
commitments without that detailed scrutiny would have been irresponsible.
All three leaders have now written to Sir George Young to give him, as the
minister responsible, our wholehearted support to the programme for Brixton
and the specific undertakings that he sought, which should enable him to
release year two's funding.
There is no doubt that any further delays to this approval will greatly
undermine the implementation of many worthwhile projects and put at risk the
financial stability of the larger developments on the central site.
A great deal of progress has already been made in the past nine months to
consolidate the working arrangements between the board of Brixton Challenge
and the council. Despite its 'hung' situation the council experienced no
difficulty in gaining cross-party support for further fast-track measures
that will assist the speedy implementation of challenge projects.
I have no doubt that Sir George Young genuinely wishes to see Brixton
Challenge succeed. It would be tragic if the argument currently being
pursued by his Tory colleagues about the future of urban funding was to find
its first victim in Brixton.

Sir, Your correspondent, Alexander Nicoll, seems surprised that a
'housewife' could achieve what Mrs Radia Kader has achieved ('Housewife who
built empire from nothing', June 9).
I would draw his attention to the book of Proverbs, chapter 31, verses 10 to
the end. There he will find that housewives have in the past been
responsible for the economy. The husbands sat by the gate chatting - the sum
total of their contribution.

FT  15 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Danger of marginalising UK aerospace
industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ALAIN DECKERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The Hercules replacement decision ('Herculean task for UK defenders',
June 13) raises two important questions about British government policy.
First, acquiring the C-130J would mean short-term budgetary pressures
prevailing upon the long-term interests of the British aerospace industry.
Given the close relation between the FLA (Future Large Aircraft) and Airbus
programmes, British Aerospace's position in the latter would inevitably be
compromised if the RAF did not procure the FLA. There would be knock-on
consequences for Britain's aerospace equipment and aero-engine industry,
which would lose FLA and Airbus work, gaining comparatively little in return
for the C-130J procurement.
Second, the decision to procure the American C-130J for the RAF would stand
in stark contrast with the call for 'enhanced, co-operation in the fields of
armaments' among western European nations, contained in the Maastricht
treaty. The FLA is the only significant European defence equipment programme
for a long time on which all European governments' views coincide. It would
be a shame if the government's budgetary preoccupations marginalised the
British aerospace and defence industries from developments at the heart of
Europe.

<TEXT>
I refer to Ian Hamilton Fazey's article on the subject of NatWest Bank's
checklist ('Campari for accountants', June 14).
Naturally enough, we also use Campari as our checklist for assessing which
bank we wish to use - such assessment should also be two-way. Our version
reads as follows:
C = Compatibility (It is easier to do business with people who are on your
own wavelength);
A = Adaptability (We live in a changing world - flexibility is the keynote);
M = Managers (We have quality people - likewise, so should the bank);
P = Performance (We have to perform, but so do the banks on our behalf);
A = Accessibility (We need computer access to our account data);
R = Rationality (We run our business on our principles, and not the bank's);
I = Interest (No, not what it charges, but its interest in us).
Oh, and by the way, when I sit down with our bank manager to enjoy a
refreshing Campari, he is from NatWest]

FT  15 JUN 94 / Tasty dish to set before the City: Michael Skapinker
examines the recent recovery in London's restaurant scene
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wandering through London in the early hours recently, Mr Roy Ackerman, a
well-known restaurateur and food publisher, was accosted by a waiter from a
Greek taverna.
The waiter had saved Pounds 100,000. A friend had accumulated a similar
amount. They wanted to open their own restaurant. Did Mr Ackerman think the
time was right?
Mr Ackerman, president of the Restaurateurs Association of Great Britain,
says a growing number of people have decided it is the right time to open a
London restaurant. In the past two months, 30 new establishments have
opened. During the same period last year, fewer than 10 opened.
Two London-based restaurant groups have been floated on the stock exchange
in recent months: Chez Gerard, which includes Bertorelli's in Covent Garden
and Cafe Fish off the Haymarket; and My Kinda Town, which runs the Chicago
Pizza Pie Factory and Henry J. Bean's.
Several chains plan to expand. Chez Gerard wants to increase its restaurants
from seven to 14 over the next three years. Corney &amp; Barrow began this year
with seven City establishments. By the end of the year, it expects to have
double that number.
Mr Joel Kissin, managing director of Conran Restaurants, which includes Le
Pont de la Tour near Tower Bridge and Quaglino's in the West End, says he
first noticed a substantial improvement in business last November.
The company was not sure whether this heralded the end of the recession or
was the result of an American Express advertisement featuring Sir Terence
Conran, Mr Kissin's partner. However, staff turnover at the restaurants
began to rise and Mr Kissin noticed it was becoming more difficult to hire
waiters, suggesting business had improved elsewhere.
Other restaurants have noticed greater employee movement too. Mr Neville
Abraham, chairman of Chez Gerard, says this is one sign of a return to
normality.
'At that age, 24 or 25, people are very mobile and will go off to Australia
with a girlfriend at the drop of a hat,' he says. 'But in a recession,
people are afraid. They don't want to leave a secure job.'
Mr Christopher Brown, managing director of Corney &amp; Barrow, says business
began to pick up last October. When staff at SG Warburg received their
bonuses in April, Corney &amp; Barrow in Broadgate had its second best day ever
(the best was the Conservatives' election victory in 1992).
The recovery in City restaurant business is more noticeable than in the West
End. Mr Mark de Wesselow, publisher of Square Meal, a guide to City
restaurants, says City employees are eating out more than staff at West End
businesses, such as advertising agencies.
There are, nevertheless, signs of increasing business throughout London. Mr
Ackerman's list of new restaurants includes suburban establishments north
and south of the river. One of the factors encouraging new entrants is the
property downturn, which has resulted in lower rents.
Even in the City, however, restaurateurs have had to make adaptions to
benefit from the upturn. Corney &amp; Barrow is converting its establishments
into wine bars, largely because this enables it to attract evening trade.
Mr Brown says it is difficult to get a decent return from a City restaurant
which is open only for lunch, and not on weekends. When you take bank
holidays into account, City lunchtime restaurants are open on average 4.7
times a week. People will not stay in the City for an evening meal, Mr Brown
says. But they will stay for a drink and a little food. At lunch times, his
customers have a light meal and non-alcoholic drinks. In the evenings, they
drink alcohol.
Several of the new London restaurants offer an attraction in addition to
food, such as live music, Mr Ackerman says. Outside the city centre,
restaurants are attracting a younger clientele, looking for entertainment as
well as a meal.
He says the most successful establishments are in the cheap or mid-price
range, appealing both to diners who were too young to go to restaurants when
the recession began and to older customers looking for less expensive places
to eat.
Mr Abraham wonders, however, whether the recovery is strong enough to
sustain the new restaurants. He says: 'I'm still quite nervous about the
economy. My instinct is to be very cautious. I don't think we'll go back to
the way it was at the end of the 1980s.'
He also questions whether the new restaurants have the business skills to
succeed. In the 15 years he has been in the restaurant trade, he says, the
quality of London chefs and of the capital's food have improved out of all
recognition. He says he has noticed little improvement in the quality of
restaurant management.
'It never ceases to amaze me, the optimism with which people open
restaurants,' he says. 'It's often because they've always wanted to cook
rather than because they've looked at their potential as businesses.'

FT  15 JUN 94 / Arts: Olaf Bar - Recital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Economic prosperity has always been
an important precondition if the arts are to flourish. By the turn of the
18th century the middle classes in Dresden were sufficiently well-off to
enjoy widespread domestic music-making and a large amount of their chamber
music and songs has come down to us.
The baritone Olaf Bar was born and lives in Dresden, so he is well placed to
delve into the city's musical history. Naumann and Weber, Reissiger and
Marschner were among the composers most active there, usually involved with
the court opera. Bar included songs by each of them in his Wigmore Hall
recital on Monday and gave a good idea of the sturdy Teutonic musical diet a
Dresden family might have favoured after dinner around 1825.
By and large there are good reasons why we do not hear many of these songs
today. One poet after another sets out for the hills, roams across green
meadows, listens to the hunting-horns and generally finds his words set to
an unremarkable melody supported by four-square harmony. In short, these are
generic pieces and Bar treated them in a generic way.
His singing is admirable for its effortless balance of words and line, but a
sharper imagination might have helped one or two come individually to life.
The opening stanza of Reissiger's 'Das Schlachtfeld' talks of the moon
shining with serenity, but no moon-lit shadows were cast by the performance,
and helpful phrases later, like the fields 'in bloody dress' looking on in
horror, were not used to add much colour.
Much more interesting was the combination of songs by Robert and Clara
Schumann, husband and wife, also Dresden-based, after the interval. Clara's
music is getting more attention these days (some record labels specialise in
women composers) and on the evidence of songs like 'Liebst du um Schonheit',
as tender as Mahler's setting, she could rise to equal the best. Her music
is not tied down by the bar-lines, like the lesser examples heard earlier.
Bar found more to engage him in these and the Robert Schumann songs. Though
the voice is short on expressive colours when he is singing quietly, he puts
across outgoing songs, like 'Die beiden Grenadiere' (not just Robert
Schumann, but also a Reissiger setting) with more communicative energy than
he used to. Perhaps the ever-supportive Geoffrey Parsons as accompanist
might challenge Bar to give more.
Second recital, with half the same programme, today

<TEXT>
A varied and enticing night. BBC2's computer series, The Net, investigates
the panic about 'computer porn' and its supposed easy access to children and
asks whether this reflects reality or adult techno-fear (8.00). Also on BBC2
the 'Screen Two' drama In The Cold Light Of Day has a most impressive cast
including Stephanie Cole, Bernard Hepton, Ronald Pickup and Frances Barber.
The story sounds attractively weird: switching from the 1930s and the
erection of a pylon in a suburban garden in northern England to the 1980s
and the revelation of a 'a love that dared not speak its name ..' (9.00).
Prior to returning to his native New Zealand, Bryan Gould who may (or may
not) be kicking himself for quitting British politics just before the Labour
party needed a new leader, appears in Frontline to offer his thoughts on
British politics (9.00 C4). Inside Story does not go all the way and
question the legitimacy of what Sir Peter Medawar called 'one of the most
stupendous confidence tricks of the century' (psychoanalysis) but it does
look into false memory syndrome (9.30 BBC1).

FT  15 JUN 94 / Arts: When comedians were craftsmen - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Declare that there was a golden age of television in the late 1960s and
early '70s and those who run television today - especially the accountants -
accuse you of wearing rose tinted spectacles. The reality was nothing like
your fond memories, they say, nothing is ever as good as nostalgia suggests
and if only you could judge those old programmes against today's you would
realise they were actually pretty primitive and limited. Well, the BBC has
recently enabled us to make such a comparison, in comedy at any rate, and
the evidence suggests that the accountants are wrong. Morecambe And Wise and
Steptoe And Son really were superior.
Having decided to mount a series to mark the 10th anniversary of Eric
Morecambe's death, BBC1 called it Morecambe And Wise: Bring Me Sunshine
which was absolutely right. To watch was to remember how your face would go
into a broad grin the moment you heard the signature tune and stay that way
right through to 'Bring Me Sunshine' at the end. Moreover, that title
emphasised the fact that these men were - in the case of Ernie Wise, still
are - not just comedians, but entertainers who certainly wanted to make you
laugh, yet, beyond that, to bring sunshine into your life.
The difference between them and today's comedy entertainers was, surely,
their background. Today's comedians grew up watching Monty Python on
television, but Morecambe and Wise grew up - not that many years earlier -
in the music halls and variety theatres. True, they did stand-up routines;
their television show always began that way, but music played a bigger part.
Can you imagine Hale and Pace doing a wicked yet fond send-up of 'Singing In
The Rain'? Or Enfield and Whitehouse with their legs stuck in buckets doing
'New York, New York'? It is not that today's performers would necessarily be
incapable of mastering the routines; what would be missing is that affection
which was central to everything that Morecambe and Wise did.
Watch them with their guest Eric Porter when he says 'Ah, so you'd like a
bit of Shakespeare?' and turns upstage to prepare a suitable extract. Eric
and Ernie vamp till ready, then Porter turns back and, in heaviest
Shakespearian accents, intones 'If they could see me now/That little gang of
mine/I'm eating fancy chow and drinking fancy wine . . .' and with dawning
delight you realise that the three of them are going into a song and dance
number. Before long they have a straw hat and silver topped cane apiece and
are into the sort of soft-shoe routine that every entertainer of that
generation seems to have learned as a juvenile. Morecambe and Wise were not
Astaire and Kelly, but they could do you a cramp roll or a ball change
without thinking about it. Perhaps Rik Mayall and Adrian Edmondson could
too, but I doubt it.
The number of 'jokes' in a Morecambe and Wise show was often small (and in
the repeats now being transmitted by BBC1 on Saturdays even smaller, because
the original 45 and 50 minute shows have been cut to 30). Much of the humour
came from 'business'. In this week's programme Eric went into a shop to buy
a pair of binoculars and Ernie promised him his most powerful pair. Go to
the other side of the shop and look at this pin, Ernie instructed, holding
up nothing. The minute Eric's back was turned Ernie whipped out a three-foot
pin from under the counter . . . That, essentially, was the gag but, in the
tradition of pantomime, they milked it expertly until the audience was
falling about.
In all those sketches where the two stars perpetually pretended to upstage
their eminent guests, they actually did precisely the opposite and made them
look good. Today's stand-up comedians exemplify the phrase: they stand up,
and they tell jokes, but they do not spread a sense of fun, contentment and
affection to 20 million viewers. As for the people who now make situation
comedies, the example set by Galton and Simpson in Steptoe And Son seems to
have been forgotten. With series such as BBC1's Once Upon A Time In The
North, and ITV's two new Sunday series, Mother's Ruin and The House of
Windsor, we have slipped back into the rut worn in the 1950s.
The picture quality of The Lost Steptoes has been poor, unsurprisingly,
perhaps, since they were non-professional copies, abandoned for years in
somebody's cellar (the BBC having destroyed the originals, of course).
However, the high quality of the writing is still unmistakable. In the
episode shown last week Harold, the son, has difficulty breaking it to his
father, Albert, that Hercules, the horse that has always pulled their rag
and bone cart, has died in the shafts and been unceremoniously removed -
'For cat's meat]' the old man snarls in fury. Albert has always been the
horse lover while Harold knows himself to be suspected of mistreating the
animal. The point is that here, as in so many Steptoe scripts, the division
between comedy and tragedy is about as substantial as morning mist.
Mother's Ruin is also about an adult son living with a parent, this time
Leslie Flitcroft with his mother. He (Roy Barraclough, late of Coronation
Street) is bald, unmarried, and panting for sex behind the counter of the
shop where he sells herbal nostrums. She (Dora Bryan) is an ageing
theatrical luvvie who lurks upstairs pouring gin from a teapot, losing money
on the horses, and making her son's life a misery. The set up may be no less
authentic than that in Steptoe And Son but the difference is stark.
The laughs in Steptoe are induced as often by pathos or the wry recognition
of some eternal truth about the human condition as by 'funny' lines. In
Mother's Ruin we are expected to laugh when Leslie says 'He had a verruca'
and his mother says 'I thought it was a Volkswagen'. We are supposed to
laugh when a man with a hangover says to Leslie 'Get out of here - both of
you'. We are invited to laugh at a schoolboy suicide attempt in which the
pills turn out to have been laxatives. We are even meant to laugh at the
line 'I turned down spotted dick to come here'. All change is not progress.

FT  15 JUN 94 / Arts: La finta giardiniera - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN ALLISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mozart's teenage operas, given a strong cast and producer, can easily hold
modern audiences. Mitridate has enjoyed recent success at Covent Garden and
Il re pastore drew enthusiasm at Opera North, but it is hard to imagine more
alive and persuasive early Mozart than Tim Albery's staging of La finta
giardiniera, which opened at Cardiff's New Theatre on Monday, Welsh National
Opera having taken over Opera North's original 1989 production.
But then Finta, written shortly before Mozart's 19th birthday, is perhaps
the most interesting of the composer's early operas. In its blend of comic
and serious styles it foreshadows Cos fan tutte and, especially, Le nozze di
Figaro, and the extraordinary music accompanying Sandrina's nightmarish
visions at the end of Act 2 anticipates not only Mozart's later style but
that of his musical successors. Finta deserves respect, and gets it from
Albery.
Albery convinces one of its dramatic viability, which in fact is not
consistently strong. He is helped by Tom Cairns's bold designs - bright
green for the garden setting with contrasting reds and blues, a heap of soil
with plastic flowers for Sandrina's garden - which play up to the opera's
absurdities. It is fascinating to see a producer who in opera has been drawn
mainly to dark dramas played out by a 'people' - his Peter Grimes, for
instance, currently in revival at English National Opera - direct a cast of
just seven with such a strong sense of comedy.
He draws intense performances from each singer. In her WNO debut, Joan
Rodgers as Sandrina - the disguised gardener of the title, really a Countess
 -gives a heart-melting performance. Her creamy soprano plumbs depths of
emotion, she sings with poise befitting the nobility Sandrina conceals.
Janice Watson is a commanding, brightly sung Arminda, Sandrina's arrogant
and sometimes hysterical rival, and plays the role for all it is worth.
The American Paul Groves portrays Count Belfiore with wit and reveals a
firm, lyric tenor - a notable UK debut. Another American, the soprano Cyndia
Sieden, makes her WNO debut as a truculent Serpetta. Ryland Davies
celebrates the 30th anniversary of his first WNO appearance as a properly
comic Mayor, and sings with a fine sense of musical style. The mezzo Ann
Taylor-Morley, a rapidly emerging talent, is fresh and impetuous in the
trouser role of Ramiro, and the baritone Neal Davies an appealing Nardo.
Finta is a long opera, but it flies past in this stylish performance and
because words - Amanda Holden's lively translation is used - are projected
with such clarity. Ivor Bolton's inflexible conducting is less than ideal,
but does little to detract from a production that should not be missed.
Further performances in Cardiff on June 15 and 18, before the production
tours to Swansea (June 23), Birmingham (June 30), Southampton (July 7) and
Bristol (July 14).

FT  15 JUN 94 / Arts: Hugh Masekela - Jazz
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARRY BOOTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Miles Davis described the young South African who had come to his attention
in the 1960s as follows: 'Hugh had his own approach to playing the trumpet .
. . had his own sound. Every time I saw him I told him just to keep on doing
his thing rather than trying to play what we were playing over here. After a
while I think he started listening to me because his playing got better.'
Davis followed Masekela's progress with interest, in the 1960s when studying
at the Manhattan School of Music. Prior to that he had studied at the
Guildhall in London after John Dankworth secured him a place there. He, like
a number of his fellow black jazz musicians, including Dollar Brand and Dudu
Pukwana, had been forced to leave Johannesburg in 1960 by the strictures of
apartheid. And like them, just as Davis advised, Masekela has retained the
distinctive musical colours of the townships to combine variously with his
bebop, big band and funk influences.
Now 65, and back in South Africa again, the trumpeter's recent recorded
output has been characterised by a toughening up in both African and
'western' funk attitude. Starting a two week stint at Ronnie Scott's on
Monday, Masekela sounds in great form. The young band, which consists of
keyboards, electric and bass guitars and drums, acts as a metronomic rhythm
section to Ngenekhaya Mahlangu's rasping tenor sax and the leader's
explosive flugelhorn. Masekela sings too: a hoarse, shouted declamation
which subsides abruptly into lilting harmonies filled out by the band.
Indeed, it is a pity that dancing isn't possible in the main room at
Ronnie's - it is too full anyway - because Masekela's jubilant highlife
tinged numbers do more than tap feet. The sweet tunes with their clattering
cowbells and chipping rhythms are irresistible. Masekela squeezing sparks
out of the horn to the encouragement of an ullulating audience is
electrifying. The close, with Masekela tragically intoning the story of the
Gold Train, is a lesson in how to build up a song for maximum effect.
London is lucky to have been a spiritual home to musicians like Masekela
during the bad years. While it seems likely that the death of apartheid will
mean that we in London will see less of Masekela, more of South Africa's
unfettered dancing-in-your-head jazz will surely come our way from those he
is now free to encourage.
Hugh Masekela is at Ronnie Scott's until June 25. Tel: 071 439 0747. Viva
South Africa, an open air festival at Highbury Fields on July 9 features
Hugh Masekela &amp; Miriam Makeba plus Ladysmith Black Mambazo among others.

FT  15 JUN 94 / Business and the Environment: Troubled waters - The Uruguay
Round may be concluded, but it leaves a handful of potential trade conflicts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This week, the gleaming Geneva headquarters of the secretariat of the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade may look a little scuffed. Officials,
still worn after the marathon of the Uruguay Round, opened their doors at
the weekend to 300-odd environmentalists and politicians from more than 100
countries.
The subject was one of the most troublesome legacies of the
recently-concluded Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation measures: the
potential conflict between free trade and the environment. The message
coming loudly, if chaotically, from the weekend's symposium was that messy
and ill-tempered conflicts are simmering on many fronts.
Peter Sutherland, director-general of the Gatt secretariat, left delegates
in no doubt that, in his view, the environment would have suffered if the
Uruguay Round had failed, because economic prospects in developing countries
would have been harmed.
Nevertheless, developed countries are still anxious that Gatt will erode
hard-won environmental standards, while developing countries fear that these
standards are protectionism in disguise. Gatt has set up a committee, due to
meet for the second time next month, to address these worries and to tackle
clashes between trade and environmental principles as they arise.
According to Richard Eglin, director of Gatt's trade and environment
division, potential conflicts fall into three categories. Much of the
weekend's debate focused on the first of these: clashes between Gatt and
high-profile international environmental treaties. These include the
Montreal Protocol on curbing substances which damage the ozone layer; the
Cites convention on trade in endangered species; and the Basle convention on
trade in hazardous waste.
Each of these treaties appears to give signatories the right to ban imports
which have been manufactured in an environmentally damaging way, even if the
products themselves are not damaging.
For example, in a hypothetical case cited by lawyers in Geneva, signatories
to the Montreal Protocol might try to block imports of Taiwanese
electronics, as Taiwan is not a signatory to the protocol, even if Taiwan
argued that the circuit boards were cleaned with ozone-safe substances.
Phillipe Sands, an environmental lawyer who is the founder of London
University's Foundation for International Law and Development, says: 'If you
ask a trade lawyer which agreement takes supremacy, the answer is that Gatt
prevails. But for a general international lawyer, it's not so black and
white.'
However, in Eglin's view, while these potential conflicts attract enormous
attention because of the public interest in ambitious green treaties, they
are largely academic at the moment. Tougher problems, he believes, are
likely to arise from clashes between Gatt and national or regional
environmental regulations.
The now notorious conflict between the US and Mexico on tuna fishing falls
firmly under this heading. Under the terms of the US Marine Mammal Act, the
Americans want to ban imports of Mexican tuna because the fishing nets also
kill dolphins. This week Geneva is due to send out to Gatt signatories the
conclusions of its second panel on the dispute. The panel, it has widely
been leaked, has again ruled that the US is wrong.
Delegates in Geneva cited a host of other areas in which they expected
similar squabbles to occur, including Brazilian shrimp fishing, which some
environmentalists believe harms turtles, and Danish standards for drink
containers.
Ira Goldman, trade representative of the Governor of California, said that
the state is bracing itself to defend its rules on car emissions and on
package recycling against European complaints under Gatt. Importers 'are
going to say 'how can you insist that California's high standards are
necessary, as New York state has different ones?',' he said. California's
response will be that levelling environmental standards would undermine
regional diversity and opportunities for 'testing' new environmental
solutions.
One of the fiercest battlegrounds is likely to be European Union rules for a
packaging directive, which would set mandatory levels for use of recycled
packaging. Developing countries are also concerned about EU eco-labelling
proposals, which would label goods with a description of the environmental
impact of their manufacture.
Martin Khor, director of the Third World Network, a Malaysian environmental
group, said that Malaysian timber companies were acutely concerned that the
eco-label would shut out imports of furniture made from Malaysian wood.
But Gatt secretariat officials stressed that while they are expecting
appeals from countries which believe their products are excluded from
markets by European environmental rules, it may prove hard to enforce Gatt
principles.
Neil Robson, Gatt adviser on packaging exports, pointed out that as the
European packaging directive does not specify where packaging must come
from, it is far from straightforward to show that it contradicts Gatt
principles of trade.
Beyond these predictable squabbles lies an 'unexplored black hole',
according to Eglin, containing questions of trade in services, transport and
genetically modified organisms which, some might argue, were environmentally
damaging. For example, some delegates suggested, a non-nuclear country might
want to ban imports of electricity produced by nuclear power.
These issues will clearly embroil veterans of the Uruguay Round in further
years of committee meetings. But judging by the huddles of packaging
industry executives on the shores of Lake Geneva last weekend  - and by the
comments of Gatt officials - that unglamorous sector will provide some of
the first battles. In Eglin's words, 'it comes down to brown paper bags -
that's where the real issue is because that's where the money is'.

FT  15 JUN 94 / Business and the Environment: Energy-efficient and
allergy-free - Computers meet medieval building design in the green 21st
century home
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A centrally heated, four-bedroom house with a fuel bill of less than Pounds
50 a year, household systems controlled by the breath of disabled people and
a low-allergen house designed for asthma sufferers can be seen at an
exhibition just opened in the English town of Milton Keynes*.
FutureWorld, sponsored by Britain's National Housebuilding Council, invited
architects, builders and producers of building products and materials to
provide a glimpse of the way homes may operate in the 21st century.
All of the 36 dwellings have had to comply with UK building and health and
safety regulations and are to be sold when the exhibition ends on July 10. A
buyer has already been found for one Pounds 40,000 property.
Common themes are energy efficiency and conservation of the environment.
Builders have opted for materials from renewable or recycled resources as
much as possible. Specially treated softwoods have been used rather than
slow-growing hardwoods from diminishing tropical forests. Some properties
incorporate Warmcell insulation, produced from recycled newsprint treated
with gypsum. Paints and glues use plant extracts and natural pigments in
many developments.
Several homes incorporate sophisticated electronic controls. This includes
an apartment for a disabled person - developed by the Electricity
Association, Admiral Homes and the Charter Partnership - which uses an
automated system allowing touch or breath control of doors, entertainment
systems, telephone, electrical appliances, computer, lights and curtains.
The low-allergen house, sponsored by the National Asthma Campaign, filters
and warms air entering the house. By changing the air every hour, humidity
is reduced to the point at which the house dust mite is destroyed.
Water-based and solvent-free paint is used to prevent an allergic reaction.
One of the most exciting developments is by two former Brighton University
architectural students, Duncan Baker-Brown and Ian McKay, whose
energy-efficient FutureHouse design won the Royal Institute of British
Architects House of the Future competition.
It combines traditional construction techniques and a custom-built computer
system with of basic physics and medieval building design.
At its heart is a simple convection system incorporating a two-storey glass
conservatory covering the south wall of the house. Air is heated inside the
conservatory and rises to be either drawn into the house using a low-power
fan or allowed to escape through windows in the conservatory.
Cooler air is drawn in through air bricks in the northern wall and passed
under the house by convection. It is either cooled further or heated
depending on the soil temperature under the building.
Deciduous vines planted inside and outside the conservatory provide shade in
summer and inhibit over-heating. Solar panels in the roof heat water for
washing and the underfloor heating system. Supplementary heat is provided by
an oil-fired boiler.
The house has been built using concrete block, brick and a timber cladding.
The 150mm blocks assist insulation.
'Medieval builders knew that thick walls helped keep heat in during winter
and warm air out of the building during summer,' says Baker-Brown.
Sensors embedded in the walls allow a Pounds 4,000 computer system developed
from an industrial computer system by Satchwell Control Systems to control
the blend of natural and man-made heating. Annual heating bills are
estimated by the architects at Pounds 40 to Pounds 50 a year.
The thick walls, combined with the natural convection flow of the building,
help to prevent condensation and damp. The building has a large electronic
office for working from home - 'potentially the greatest energy-saving
feature of them all,' says McKay.
FutureHouse cost about Pounds 130,000 to build or Pounds 650 a square metre,
excluding land. Offers are expected to start at Pounds 185,000.
*FutureWorld exhibition at Kents Hill, Milton Keynes, runs until July 10.

FT  15 JUN 94 / Management: An educational experience - John Gapper on a
chance for executives to study a topic relevant to their company in the US
for free
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Are you a British executive interested in learning about how US companies
run schools, reshape employment policies, or sell products to ethnic
minorities? Is your company interested in public-private joint ventures in
the UK, but ignorant about how such ventures work in the US?
If so, you have a chance to study the topic that interests you at first
hand, free.
The Financial Times is joining the Commonwealth Fund, a US foundation, to
offer a fellowship for up to 12 months to a UK company executive who wants
to observe innovation in the US private sector. He or she will travel the
US, seeing how American companies are responding to competitive pressures,
as well as social and demographic changes.
If the offer sounds unusual to UK readers, that is because it emerges from a
US tradition of private philanthropy largely absent in Britain. The new
fellowship is an adaptation of the Commonwealth Fund's existing Harkness
Fellowships. Since 1990, these have offered mid-career British
professionals, mostly in the public sector, the opportunity to examine US
innovation in their field.
In the past three years, this has allowed British doctors to examine the US
healthcare system, and education professionals to observe changes in US
schools. Last week, the prime minister's office announced that the UK
government is to part-fund a new fellowship scheme based on the Harkness
idea, offering Americans a chance to examine UK practice.
The Harkness Fellowships, although theoretically open to the private sector,
have not attracted many applicants from UK companies. The new fellowship has
been devised to broaden the scope of the awards. It will allow a UK company
to observe changes in the US through the eyes of a younger executive whom it
regards as a future leader in its industry.
Among those on the selection panel for the award is Howard Davies,
director-general of the Confederation of British Industry. Davies says the
new FT-Harkness fellowship is timely because the barriers between public and
private enterprise are now breaking down in the UK in a similar manner to
the US. He argues that although the fellowship may not be of direct
short-term benefit to a company, it will gain in the longer term through the
participation of a valued employee. 'There are many things that companies
need to be prodded to do. A company may not see the short-term financial
advantage of the experience, but it will probably learn something to its
advantage,' he says.
Keith Kirby, director of the Harkness Fellowships, says US companies are
used to studying social and political change in order to adapt their
businesses, and the fellowship offers an insight into how they do that.
Kirby says that the selection panel, including Ian Hargreaves, deputy editor
of the Financial Times, and Sir David Scholey, chairman of the investment
bank SG Warburg, will encourage broad-based proposals. 'Narrow technical
projects are less useful than something which will broaden the mind of
someone who is likely to be at the top of their industry or field in due
course,' he says.
The theme of the fellowship is: 'Renewing the company: sustaining
competitiveness; improving business performance against a background of
rapid social change.' Information and application forms are available until
October 6 from: Harkness-Financial Times Award, Harkness Fellowships, 28
Bedford Square, London WC1B 3EG.
John Gapper is banking editor of the Financial Times. He was a Harkness
Fellow in 1991-92, studying education and training in US schools, colleges
and companies.

FT  15 JUN 94 / Management: Crocodile scales - Motoko Rich meets busking
boss Theo Lieven, pianist and president of Germany's largest PC manufacturer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The 250 music-lovers who gathered at St James's Church in London's
Piccadilly for a performance of Mozart's Double Piano Concerto in April
were, said one of the performers, a bit unusual. 'When they clapped they
really appreciated the music,' says Theo Lieven. 'Normally when I play in
concerts you may have people there who clap because they have to.'
Lieven, though, is a bit unusual himself. A pianist who has performed with
orchestras in Vienna, Berne, Louisiana and California, he is also president
of Vobis Microcomputer, Germany's largest PC manufacturer and Europe's
largest PC retailer. Some past audiences may therefore have felt compelled
to applaud because they work for him.
Lieven is one of an elite band of busking bosses that includes Trevor
Holdsworth, retired chairman of GKN (a pianist who has played with
orchestras in London), Sony president Norio Ohga (trained opera singer and
international conductor in his spare time) and Kenichi Ohmae, head of
management consultant McKenzie's Tokyo office (flautist who performs in
Tokyo).
While he makes no simple connections between the disciplines of music and
business, Lieven suggests that the motivations to play an instrument or head
a company may be similar. 'In the concert you have the clapping of the
audience, in business you have the clapping of the bank,' he says. 'If you
play the piano you are your own conductor. So if you are not someone who
knows what he wants you cannot play the piano. Or lead a company.'
For the Vobis president, piano playing intensifies rather than eases his
lifestyle.
He has been leading the jet-setting life of a performer (he flies his own
aeroplane) since 1991, when he met Hannes Keller, a software supplier and
fellow pianist, at a press conference in Switzerland. In 1992, when
recording a CD, they were noticed by William Kushner, conducter of the Lake
Charles Symphony in Louisiana, in the US. Kushner invited the pair to play
with the orchestra in the US.
The idea of getting paid to play gave Lieven such a thrill that he never
banked the cheque (for Dollars 1,500). Indeed, the international piano
foundation that he established at a villa near Lake Como in Italy in 1991 -
which every year sponsors five pianists to take master classes with
outstanding musicians - suggests he is keen to put more into music than he
takes out.
Trained as a classical pianist in his home town of Aachen, Germany, where
Vobis is based today, he won second prize in a city piano competition at the
age of 18.
'If I had been the first-prize winner I would have continued but since I was
not I decided to do something else,' he says.
That something else was a mathematics course at Aachen University. There, at
the age of 23, he and a friend, Vobis partner Rainer Fraling, started a
business selling Hewlett-Packard scientific calculators to classmates. Soon
they had secured a contract to sell 2,500 HP calculators for DM1,000 (Pounds
400) each. From there the company expanded by about 50 per cent a year,
opening shops throughout Germany and expanding into 10 European countries.
The business really took off, though, after Vobis launched its manufacturing
divison when an order for Commodore computers failed to show up. Lieven was
desperate for units and flew to Taiwan to see a computer parts supplier. By
January of 1988, Vobis was making its own machines.
'At the time it was a short-term thing,' said Lieven. But Vobis's operation
grew, and now the company is second only to Olivetti in PC production in
Europe, with a turnover in 1993 of DM2bn.
A friend once likened Vobis's management style to the temperament of a
crocodile. 'They sit for hours and hours in warm water looking and looking,
doing nothing and relaxing,' Lieven says. 'But the moment a zebra comes and
they spot a chance for food, they snap it.' Lieven prepares for concerts on
the same principle. 'One hour of effort a day is enough.'

FT  15 JUN 94 / Management: Travel sense for high-fliers - Michael Dempsey
on corporate attitudes to air safety
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The recent Chinook helicopter crash not only wiped out decades of experience
in the fight against terrorism in Northern Ireland; it raised questions
about the sense of putting 25 senior personnel on one aircraft.
In the commercial sector, the risk of losing an entire higher echelon has
long been recognised as an issue that has to be addressed.
'If this happened to a commercial organisation I would expect to see the
share price collapse,' says Michael Regester, a crisis management consultant
with a long track record in the oil industry - a business that requires very
senior staff to travel widely, often visiting remote sites by helicopter.
Companies, says Regester, have to prepare for the worst.
'The basic rule is that you never put more than two directors on the same
flight. And the company has to get across the message that it is not totally
reliant on one individual,' he says.
Regester warns that the loss of a high-profile director, by accident or
otherwise, can be devastating to a company.
Oil company Chevron rules that no more than two out of three of its
principal officers can fly on the same aircraft. A total of five directors
can fly together but they must comprise no more than two executive and three
non-executive directors.
'The thinking is obviously that in the event of an accident we've still got
at least one principal officer to assume command right away,' a Chevron
spokesman says. 'It's just commonsense. You cannot afford to have your board
wiped out.'
'Our board members do a lot of travel offshore,' says Chevron. 'If they have
to visit a rig they might use up to three helicopters, even though the party
would fit into one.'
IBM, the world's largest computer company, also has a policy on air travel.
In August 1983, Don Estridge, head of the company's Entry Systems division,
was killed when a Delta Airlines flight crashed at Dallas Airport. The loss
of Estridge, a visionary who had championed the personal computer within
IBM, arguing against colleagues who refused to believe that one day a PC
would sit on every desk in the business world, was keenly felt.
By coincidence several other IBM personnel were also on that flight but in
spite of the personal loss incurred, the crash did not wipe out a
significant part of the company's leadership.
IBM, which says its precautions predate the Dallas accident, issues an
instruction letter on flight safety. It says no more than three country
general managers or heads of divisions should travel on the same flight.
Checks are carried out on airline safety. For corporate jet and helicopter
hire only approved companies are used and IBM is rumoured to inspect
individual pilot's records. The aim is to ensure that a business jet
containing senior staff is only piloted by a very experienced crew.
While companies like Chevron and IBM have formal procedures on air travel,
elsewhere dividing travelling parties is regarded as too obvious to need
spelling out.
'It's an unwritten policy,' a London-based spokeswoman for Japan's Nomura
Bank explains.
In January, Nomura's London arm sent 20 top staff in its bonds division to a
fixed income conference in Prague. Mindful of eastern Europe's air safety
record, the specialists travelled in three groups on separate flights.
Taking a different approach, oil company BP has found that a new emphasis on
the use of video-conferencing is one way to reduce corporate air miles.
Britain's Ministry of Defence is already under pressure to contract out more
facilities to the private sector. The armed forces view this trend with
suspicion, but in the aftermath of the Chinook crash there would at least
seem to be some lessons to be learned in the area of air safety.

FT  15 JUN 94 / People: Owen flies off to PPP
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Peter Owen, 47, who has just spent a year trying to transform the fortunes
of Aer Lingus, where he was group chief executive, is joining PPP, one of
the UK's leading providers of healthcare finance, as managing director. He
starts his new job with PPP on August 1.
A year ago Aer Lingus was losing IPounds 1.2m a week. Those annual losses of
Pounds 62.4m have been reduced, though the current year's figures (which
will be announced in October) are still likely to show losses in the region
of IPounds 56m.
Owen joined Aer Lingus in May 1993, having been director of operations with
British Airways from 1985 to 1990. He left BA to become chief executive of
Innocan, a Canadian holding company with businesses in textiles,
distribution, communications and specialist cleaning and consultancy.
Owen spent a total of 21 years with British Airways, his time there
culminating in his assisting in the management of the acquisition and merger
with British Caledonian in 1987.
At PPP he succeeds Roy Forman, who announced his retirement on July 1 1993,
after 14 years with the company. PPP provides private medical care insurance
for almost 2m people. In 1993 group income was Pounds 500m, with pre-tax
profits of Pounds 40m.

FT  15 JUN 94 / People: In-house or boutique? Pundits swap
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Roger Nightingale, 49, an early pioneer of global stock market strategy in
London, has decided that working for a broker is more rewarding than running
one's own investment research boutique.
Four years after setting up Roger Nightingale &amp; Associates, Nightingale and
his firm are joining WI Carr (Far East), part of France's Banque Indosuez.
Nightingale's decision to throw in his lot with Indosuez comes only a month
after David Roche, 47, Morgan Stanley's stock market strategist, decided to
set up his own London research boutique.
The two moves highlight the contrasting views of the viability of
independent research firms in London. Roche, whose old employer is one of
his biggest clients, says that it is absurd to think all research should be
conducted in-house. However, Nightingale's experience raises the question of
whether institutional investors are prepared to pay for research which they
can get free from the big brokerage firms.
Nightingale, who spent 20 years with Hoare Govett and is a non-executive
director of M &amp; G Investment Management, says that it's virtually impossible
to make a business out of UK research on its own. By contrast, overseas
clients in the Far East and the US were more prepared to pay for independent
research.
He says that everybody is 'digging in the same pot of gold' but many clients
prefer to get subsidised research from a broker rather than pay for it
directly. He believes that the weakness of the big US brokers, which make
most of their money from primary business, is that their research can
'become a little less frank'.
Although his new employer is heavily biased towards Far Eastern business,
Nightingale will continue to offer a worldwide investment view. He hasn't
forgotten the advice of an old boss who told him always to make sure he
competes in an area where the competition is weak.

John Rink, 47, joint head of the litigation department at Allen &amp; Overy, the
City-based international law firm, has been seconded to British Aerospace as
its legal director for a period of 'up to two years'. Initially, his
appointment will be on a full-time basis while he carries out a review of
the structure of BAe's legal services, though it will not remain full-time
for the whole two year period. He will be assisted by Jeremy Thomas, another
Allen &amp; Overy partner, also seconded to the company during this period.
His appointment follows a 'beauty parade' involving six City law firms,
which was won by Allen &amp; Overy. BAe said yesterday that as the company's
interests became more diverse and it became involved in more joint ventures,
particularly with international partners, there was a need to re-appraise
its legal services requirements. It would continue to use a number of
different law firms to provide external legal services.

FT  15 JUN 94 / Recruitment: Putting a fence around the workplace -
Personnel policies should be central to the overall strategy of a company,
but all too often they are not
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The personnel policies of a company ought to be a vital component of its
overall strategy, but all too frequently they are not. This is the main
assertion of a fascinating new study on human resource management in British
multi-divisional companies.
Widespread internal restructuring may be going on across the corporate
scene, yet employee relations issues 'are rarely taken into account'.
Indeed, as companies introduce more rigorous financial control it becomes
more difficult for them to adopt management styles 'based on beliefs about
the best way to manage people at work'.
'The influence of personnel management over strategic decisions is limited'
and the 'management of employee relations is deemed to be an operational
matter wherever it is located,' argues the study.
As a result, its authors, Dr John Purcell of Templeton College, Oxford and
Dr Bruce Ahlstrand at Trent University, Ontario, argue the corporate
institutions and procedures dealing with employees have had to be fitted -
often forcibly - into a mould created by change initiated by companies
completely outside the industrial relations arena.
The authors argue persuasively that not enough attention has been paid to
the fact that 'the human resources of particular operating units fail to
recognise that these units are often part of a much larger and complex
organisational structure'. By constructing a fence around the workplace,
human resource management enthusiasts obscure its integral position within
the multi-divisional company.
Basing their study on nine unnamed companies over a 10-year period, Purcell
and Ahlstrand confirm that personnel functions have become isolated from the
strategic centre of the enterprise. As a result, personnel managers are
uncertain of what their role ought to be within the company and take little
part in devising corporate strategy.
The book provides a useful and a relatively jargon-free account of how
corporate decisions influence human resource management. The authors quote
one personnel director who suggests that what drives change in the company
is 'the realisation that there is no calm water around the next headland'.
Apparently 'it is no longer a case of belt-tightening or taking short-term
action to weather a storm'. Instead, there is a need 'to cope with chaos,
build for flexibility and find ways of integrating employment relations into
the fabric of the organisation'.
The authors are right to conclude that while 'remarkably few organisations
seriously consider questions of management styles and the most effective way
to manage their employees', doing nothing or simply reacting to events is no
longer good enough. 'There is a rationale for designing human resource
management to add to competitive advantage and economic success,' they
argue. Let us hope some companies are listening to this sensible message.

Purcell and Bruce Ahlstrand, Oxford University Press, Pounds 30.00 hardback,

Contracting for IT
Growth in the number of skilled staff on short-term contracts of between
three and nine months in the information technology sector looks set to
become one of the most important trends in the labour market during the
current economic recovery.
'New companies are asking for contractors that have never done so in the
past', says Mr Tony Coombes, director at Systems Resources, a software and
services company which supplies professional services and systems software
to corporate customers. 'Large companies have cut to the bone in the IT area
during the recession and they are not taking on permanent workers again.'
The Coventry-based company has just announced a 58 per cent increase in the
number of information technology contract staff taken into employment over
the past 12 months to the first week of May to 509, compared with 322 in the
previous comparable period.
'One of the reasons for the increase is that contractors can provide the
specialist skills that permanent staff do not have, particularly where it
would be too costly to retrain them. The company can often get the job done
more quickly and more cost-effectively than with permanent staff', argues
Coombes.
He expects a 50 per cent increase over the next five years in the number of
contract workers in information technology to add to the 25,000 currently on
the market. 'Employers are reluctant to take on extra permanent staff for
projected-based work,' says Coombes. 'Contract staff are a more favourable
alternative. Corporate organisations which have felt the consequence of
permanent staff reductions over the last two years are now seeing gaps in
the development skills they need, to configure the systems they require to
remain competitive. The advantages of flexible contract staff is a huge plus
for their immediate information technology development.'
Science PhD unease
British employers are becoming concerned at what they believe to be a fall
in the quality of PhD science recruits currently and in the future,
according to a new study from the Institute of Manpower Studies in Brighton.
But the demand for the 3,500 PhD science graduates who leave British
universities every year is unlikely to go up at least until near the end of
the decade.
The survey suggests 'there is no evidence of a significant trend to a
broader recruitment market in general'. Just over a third of the PhD science
graduates remain in academic life as researchers or teachers, while 30 per
cent go into the private sector, with a large number taking up employment in
the oil and chemical industries and in research and development and almost
10 per cent going to the public sector.
'No consistent view emerged from employers about their satisfaction with
current PhD training,' suggested the study. But it found that they thought
there was need 'for more interpersonal skills training and business
awareness' from the PhD intake.
Employers also claimed 'more formal training had squeezed out creativity and
original thought'. They added they believed PhD science graduates had grown
too specialised and lacked 'a breadth of view of their scientific
discipline'.
The Institute of Manpower Studies indicated that 'the vast majority of
employers have little or no demand at all' for PhD science graduates because
they did not need people on their pay-rolls with that level of
qualification.
But the unemployment level for such science graduates remains at less than 3
per cent, considerably lower than for first degree science graduates which
stands at over 10 per cent. The survey suggests, however, they are going to
have accept much more flexible forms of working in the future with more
short-term contracts.
It is also clear that PhD science graduates in jobs will have to accept a
greater commercialisation of their activities. As one major electronics
company told the survey: 'We are now a business first, which does research.
We have changed our shape to be more customer focused and now have more
worldly skills for commerce and finance. This has meant fewer PhDs and more
general all-round skills'.

FT  15 JUN 94 / Reorganisation could mean double severance pay for authority
workers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Local authority workers who lose their jobs as a result of reorganisation
could be paid more than double the amount of severance pay to which they
would otherwise have been entitled, the Department of the Environment said
yesterday, John Authers writes.
The announcement added to fears that the new structure will be costly and
that outgoing authorities preparing for abolition will take on heavy
financial commitments.
All the funds for these payments would come from local authorities' own
resources, and not from central government or from pension funds.
Under the proposals the maximum payment for employees under the age of 50
will be 66 weeks' pay, compared to a maximum payout in usual circumstances
of 24 1/2 weeks, with 30 weeks for those over 50. The minimum payment will
be at least 1 1/2 weeks' wages for each year of service, up to a maximum of
45 weeks. The equivalent existing entitlement is 22.
The department will consult local authorities until July 13.

The main union in the Inland Revenue has won agreement for a path-breaking
agreement with the US computer company EDS as part of the contracting out of
the Revenue's computer operations.
About 1,600 members of the Inland Revenue Staff Federation have voted by
three to one to accept the deal with EDS which guarantees their existing
conditions of employment. The union is particularly pleased it has a
recognition deal as EDS is known in the US as a non-union company.
About 1,000 staff will transfer to EDS on July 1, with another 800 staff

FT  15 JUN 94 / Fewer directors may face charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The number of prosecutions and disqualification petitions against company
directors this year may fail to meet official objectives because of new
guidelines intended to clear a backlog of outstanding cases, the Department
of Trade and Industry said yesterday, Andrew Jack writes.
The department, commenting on an internal memo sent by the senior official
receiver to Insolvency Service offices, said it was possible that
prosecutions would fall in line with a fall in the number of investigations
of liquidations and bankruptcies.
The senior official receiver has written asking staff in offices around the
UK to identify in the next four weeks an additional 11,000 cases to be
closed - more than half the total closed last year.
The guidance said an average of an hour should be enough to examine cases
and decide whether they could be closed. It said staff need not look for
possible offences or areas for investigation.
However, the principal union in the agency has sent guidance to its members
suggesting that this time is inadequate and advising them to take adequate
care in their scrutiny of documents.
The bulletin, being circulated to members of the insolvency service branch
of the Institute of Professional and Managerial Staffs, the civil service
union, says: 'Examiners must not be used to sausage-machine cases for
closing by turning a blind eye to possible assets or other matters.'

FT  15 JUN 94 / Banham digs in for the liberation of Blackpool
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS and IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Blackburn, Blackpool, Lancaster, Portsmouth, Slough and an enlarged Reading
will become self-governing under plans to redraw the English local
government map announced yesterday by the Local Government Commission.
Blueprints for Berkshire, Hampshire and Lancashire, following five other
counties announced on Monday, signal a continued intention to replace the
two-tier system of counties and districts in non-metropolitan England.
County councils in many areas would be abolished and existing districts
merged to form unitary authorities.
The commission risked a row with the government by recommending that the
two-tier system should stay in place for all of Hampshire except Southampton
and Portsmouth.
The commission's detailed recommendations, which will go to public
consultation, are:
Berkshire: The county, and all except one of its districts, agreed a
proposal for four unitary authorities which the commission has now endorsed.
Slough and an 'expanded' Reading would become unitaries, while Bracknell
Forest, Windsor and Maidenhead, and most of Wokingham would merge to create
Royal East Berkshire. Newbury would also be unitary, and would take in a few
Hampshire parishes.
Hampshire: If the first option of leaving the county unchanged outside its
two biggest cities is rejected, the commission's favourite alternative of
seven unitary authorities involves radical restructuring, and would be
fiercely opposed by the county.
The unitaries would be New Forest; Basingstoke and Deane with the north part
of Test Valley; Hart and Rushmoor; Winchester, East Hampshire and the south
part of Test Valley; Southampton and Eastleigh; Fareham and Gosport; and
Portsmouth and Havant.
Financial consultants described the first option as 'the worst of all
worlds', as Portsmouth and Southampton attract proportionately more
government grants than the rest of the county. The shrunken county council
might therefore suffer a disproportionately sharp reduction in grant.
Lancashire: Eight unitary authorities are the commission's preferred choice
for Lancashire, but local people can opt instead for six or seven. They can
also keep the status quo of a county council with 14 second-tier districts.
The eight would be Lancaster; Blackburn (represented in parliament by
Labour's local government spokesman, Mr Jack Straw, who favours unitary
councils); Wyre and Fylde; West Lancashire; Chorley, Preston and South
Ribble; Blackpool; Hyndburn and Ribble Valley; and Burnley, Pendle and
Rossendale.
Annual savings are put between Pounds 1m and Pounds 8m, with set-up costs of
Pounds 21m to Pounds 28m.
The six-authority proposal would cost as much to set up but would save more
 -between Pounds 9m and Pounds 16m a year. But it would require Blackpool to
join Wyre and Fylde, and Blackburn to merge with Hyndburn and Ribble Valley.
The mergers would be accepted by the commission if there were support for
them, but neither is likely to find favour in the rural areas of Wyre, Fylde
and Ribble Valley, the last of which is unlikely to welcome Hyndburn anyway.
The case for the status quo will be vigorously fought by Lancashire county
council, which secured a judgment from the High Court to ensure that this
option was included in consultation.

FT  15 JUN 94 / High-street spending rate slows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The rate of spending in high-street shops slowed slightly in May, the
Confederation of British Industry's distributive trade survey showed
yesterday.
But the CBI pointed out that UK traders were still reporting that sales were
rising on an annual basis, and the recovery appeared to be continuing at a
moderate pace.
Mr Nigel Whittaker, chairman of the CBI's distributive trade survey panel,
said: 'So far tax increases which came into force in April do not appear to
have had any real impact on the course of the high-street recovery, but we
need to be cautious as it may be some time before their full impact is
felt.'
The proportion of wholesalers, retailers and car dealers reporting increased
sales volume was higher than last year. Those reporting an increase minus
those reporting a decrease gave a positive balance of 29 per cent.
This compares with a positive balance of 19 in April and a positive balance
of 28 last year.
Most of this growth was caused by a surge in wholesalers' sales. Retailers
reported a dip compared with last month. The number of retail outlets
reporting an annual rise in sales was a positive balance of 12, down from a
balance of 22 in April, but in line with returns in the first quarter.
The result disappointed City analysts, who warned that official retail sales
data, to be published tomorrow, may show a slowdown in consumer activity.
Meanwhile, the balance of motor traders reporting an increase in sales was
only 16 - the lowest figure so far this year.
The survey, which was conducted in the last two weeks of last month, showed
that big retailers were continuing to fare better than small ones, the CBI
said.
Within the sectors, specialist food suppliers fared the worst, with the
majority of these retailers reporting that their level of business was down.
The CBI said yesterday, however, that this slump followed an exceptionally
strong level of sales last May.
Retailers in the furniture and carpet sector reported that sales were
relatively flat compared with a year ago, but the DIY and hardware sector
reported that sales were up - a trend that may reflect the patchy nature of
the housing market recovery.
Footwear and leather goods shops reported the fastest annual growth in
sales, with more than three-quarters of retailers reporting that sales were
up on an annual basis.
Economists said this might reflect price competition in this sector - an
analysis that was echoed by the CBI, which said that with consumers still
extremely price conscious, there were few signs of any inflationary
pressure.
The number of retailers reporting a rise in prices rose to a positive
balance of 30 in last month, from a positive balance of 20 when the question
was last asked in February. The balance of retailers expecting to raise
prices in the coming month was a positive 28 compared with 29 in February.
The number of wholesalers reporting price rises fell significantly.

FT  15 JUN 94 / EU seeks views on Cadbury link with lottery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY and EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission is calling for comments on commercial agreements
that link Cadbury Schweppes products to the operation of the National
Lottery.
The confectionery company is a member of the Camelot consortium that is due
to launch the UK's National Lottery in November.
Under the terms of the agreement with Camelot Cadbury Schweppes has the
right to try to advertise its products in connection with the prize-draws -
a connection that could be extended to television for an agreed fee.
The plan is that confectionery displays carrying the Cadbury name will be
offered as part of the lottery terminal which will dispense and authenticate
tickets.
The commission said yesterday that it was examining the consortium venture
to see whether it contravened EU rules on free and fair competition - normal
practice for any joint ventures that threaten, however remotely, to create a
dominant position in the market.
The commission said: 'This is purely normal.' It added that a decision would
be taken in the next two months, well before the lottery's November start
date.
Camelot emphasised yesterday that retailers would be free to reject the
Cadbury's display and have a terminal on its own. Retailers could accept the
display and fill it with products of other companies.
In calling for comments on any aspect of Camelot's plans the commission
notes that Camelot is obliged 'to use reasonable endeavours to promote the
use by retailers of a display unit supplied by Cadbury Schweppes to hold the
lottery terminal and to display Cadbury Schweppes branded confectionery'.
However, the commission added that retailers selling lottery tickets would
be under no contractual obligation to go along with the Cadbury Schweppes
plan.
Cadbury Schweppes said yesterday it was fully aware that the European
Commission was looking at the lottery agreement and did not believe this
would present a problem.

FT  15 JUN 94 / 'We find these surveys a pain in the neck': Gillian Tett
reports mixed views on the value of responding to questionnaires
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Confederation of British Industry's latest business survey was greeted
by a City fan club yesterday. After 30 years of polling British businesses,
the surveys have won a reputation among City economists as being among the
better barometers of the economy.
The CBI's problem, however, is that the reviews from executives are more
mixed.
The manager of one northern furniture factory said: 'Quite frankly, we find
these surveys a pain in the neck. We get inundated with so many that
answering them could be a full-time job. And some of that information we
don't want to give out anyway.'
Although many large companies share the City's enthusiasm for the survey,
faithfully filling it in every month, many smaller businesses are less sure.
And while these companies are probably a minority, this patchy support may
be creating variations in the way that companies complete the results.
The CBI insists that this mixed level of support is normal, and says its
surveys are weighted to account for it. In an effort to persuade companies
to participate the CBI promises anonymity and sends respondents free survey
results.
Of the 3,000 manufacturers polled each month, about 1,400 normally respond.
The distributive trade survey, published yesterday, usually gets about 500
responses from a mailing list of 15,000.
Mr Sudhir Junankar, head of economic trends at the CBI, said: 'The surveys
are voluntary. We can't force them on anyone so we try to make it as easy as
possible.' He said that the surveys were kept simple to avoid burdening
companies.
The monthly industrial survey, for example, includes only five subjective
questions. Although the quarterly surveys are more detailed, including
evaluations of expectations over the next four months, the answers are kept
to the 'better' or 'worse' criterion, and do not demand precise estimates.
For some companies, at least, the tactic has worked. Mr Philip Aiken,
managing director of Gas Europe in BOC, said: 'The forms they send you are
very user-friendly. My 11-year-old daughter could fill them in.' He said he
completed the survey because he found the results valuable.
But as Mr Aiken pointed out, the flip side of this approach was that the
vagueness of the questions meant companies could answer them in varying
ways. 'I do sometimes wonder about the quality of the data. I suspect some
people might answer depending on how they feel that day,' he said.
Most companies insist that their response is more scientific - the CBI says
senior management answer the survey in more than 80 per cent of cases. But
Mr Junankar admitted that companies could vary in the way they interpreted
issues such as 'business constraints' - and, more crucially, their concepts
of 'normal' business activity.
Mr Aiken, for example, judges whether business has improved by looking for
changes of 2 per cent or more, usually based on a year-on-year plan, and
does not include labour availability in his assessment of business
constraints.
Mr Richard Sutton, company secretary of Loake Brothers, a Northamptonshire
shoemaker, defines what is 'normal' by 'running my eye over the last couple
of years'. Changes of 10 per cent in either direction are considered to be
'better' or 'worse'. He considers that labour contraints, such as the
availability of workers, are central to any definition of business
constraints.

'better' or 'worse'. He considers that labour contraints, such as the
availability of workers, are central to any definition of business
constraints.
Mr Edward Roberts, of the spring makers Heath Springs, takes a more
computerised approach, calculating the productivity of his workforce down to
the last penny.
An economist who answers the survey for a large construction group said that
he responded by comparing the present performance with a five or 10-year
period - a measure that left him concluding that activity in the last three
years had been 'below normal', in spite of small interim rises.
The CBI points out that these variations do not appear to affect the data
significantly. Indeed, some economists say the surveys often provide a
better economic guide than the official statistics.
Some companies suggest that the CBI should issue more precise guidelines or
ask for a numerical evaluation. The CBI is reluctant to do this, since
changing the way companies answer would cause a break in the series.
Mr Junankar suggested that analysts should be aware that a company's concept
of 'normal' could change over time, and give more focus to shorter-term
comparisons of changes in business mood.
This message could prove pertinent as economists debate how far the UK
economy is proceeding along the path of a 'normal' recovery.

FT  15 JUN 94 / Railtrack negotiators at odds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Today's shutdown of the railway network by most signalmen is due to a
breakdown of understanding between the RMT rail union and Railtrack.
The union wants an 11 per cent 'interim' rise for the railwaymen before
entering negotiations on a new pay system. Railtrack insists any new money
must be conditional on certain work changes.
A bitter internal discussion on what to do appears to divide the company.
The board failed to agree last Thursday on a course of action. Company
attitudes do appear to have hardened over the weekend, however.
The union's anger was undoubtedly fuelled by the change of tone on Monday,
when Railtrack took a harder line. The board met and insisted that any pay
rise for the signalmen beyond the 2.5 per cent on offer for all its
employees would have to come through a negotiated package of productivity
improvements by the end of September.
Yesterday Mr Jimmy Knapp, RMT general secretary, released an internal letter
sent out on June 9 by Mr Colin Hall, Railtrack South's production manager,
to six other area managers to prove that there was an offer.
This specifically mentions the company's offer to signalmen as being 5.7 per
cent from April 1 with the 1994 pay offer 'to be based on the new rate'. Mr
Hall added that 'strings' would be attached to the deal.
These would cover the introduction of a 'national promotion structure', more
flexible working and a 'commitment to discussions on job evaluation,
signalling restructuring, and withdrawal of industrial action'.
Mr Hall wrote: 'The present expectation is that the RMT will reject this.
The company cannot go any further than addressing the differentials issue
which the offer properly does.'
Mr Chris Leah, Railtrack's chief negotiator, said yesterday Mr Hall's letter
was 'an embarrassment' and that what it said was 'misconceived'. He denied
that any offer - oral or written - had been presented to the RMT in
negotiations.
Further evidence of disarray at the company was also apparent yesterday in a
briefing note dated May 16, from Mr Leah, which the RMT has acquired. He
writes about an '11 per cent offer on basic rates' for railwaymen as a
'minimum increase to recognise the grade and to obviate differentials with
traffic grades staff'.
He adds that the 11 per cent on offer does not 'include negotiations for
annualised hours, concentration of relief staff and restructuring'.
He writes: 'It may well be increased as a result of the negotiations with
the trade union.'
Yesterday Mr Leah said that the company recognised that the signalmen had a
genuine grievance. Their relative pay position was anomalous and discussion
about wage restructuring for them dates back to 1987.
The next one-day stoppage by signalmen is scheduled for June 22.

FT  15 JUN 94 / Consumers' Association staff start pay strike
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
About a fifth of the workforce of the Consumers' Association, the publisher
of Which? and several other magazines, started a three-day strike yesterday,
Lisa Wood writes.
'Pay is the central issue, but morale at the CA has been low for some time,'
said MSF, the science and technical union which along with the National
Union of Journalists represents about 160 of the organisation's 500 staff.
The unions had submitted a claim for a rise in basic wage rates of 5.4 per
cent. About 300 employees accepted a 2.5 per cent offer while talks with the
unions broke down in May.
MSF said: 'There has been a recent history of redundancies, restructuring
and abandoning of costly projects that had shaken staff's confidence in
management.
'The ballot for industrial action produced a vote that was 80 per cent in
favour of a strike.'
The CA said that publication of its magazines would not be disrupted by the
action.

FT  15 JUN 94 / Clients lash out at professionals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Professionals overcharge and provide a generally poor service to their
clients, says a survey of companies' views published yesterday.
Only half of nearly 200 small companies felt accountants provided a useful
letter to management to accompany the annual audit, according to a survey
sponsored by Levy Gee, the accountancy firm.
Just 19 per cent of businesses felt their bankers offered value for money,
while half expressed dissatisfaction over value from their solicitors and 43
per cent from their accountants.
Few advisers explained adequately how their fees were calculated, and
accountants' charges were singled out for the most criticism.
One respondent said there were often 'too many round figures for comfort'.
One company reported that accountants are 'patronisingly expensive and tend
to try and blind one with jargon'.
Another complained that they 'continually search for angles to overcharge'.
Bankers and solicitors were criticised for failing to keep clients
up-to-date with important developments. Three-quarters of companies surveyed
believed that their bankers did not understand their business sector,
compared with two-thirds for solicitors and 43 per cent for accountants.
Two-fifths of bankers met expectations for quality and deadlines, compared
with 62 per cent of solicitors and 70 per cent of accountants.
Only three-quarters of the companies felt senior bankers were easily
accessible. Nearly all felt that executives and partners in law and
accountancy practices were easily accessible.
Levy Gee concluded that advisers needed to anticipate what customers
required and be more active in helping businesses develop plans.
The firm urged professionals to be more open about fees and charges, and to
adopt a flexible approach when companies are struggling.

FT  15 JUN 94 / Stoppage could lead to penalty for company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The strike by railway signalmen represents the first serious challenge to
the new structure which is being fashioned from the framework of British
Rail.
It also constitutes a considerable personal test for Mr Robert Horton,
chairman of Railtrack. Mr Horton, who left British Petroleum with a
formidable reputation for toughness, has to show that he can create a more
modern railway.
Under British Rail, the internal pressures on the negotiators to keep the
trains running while giving away as little as possible would have been
strong. But under the newly decentralised railway system which is being
created, these pressures have been made more acute. If Railtrack, set up on
April 1 to take over BR's track, signalling and stations, fails to provide a
working railroad it must compensate the train operating companies.
A failure to keep the trains running puts direct financial pressures on a
company which hopes to achieve a stock market flotation before the next
election.
Railtrack is unfortunate to have inherited a dispute which has been
simmering for seven years.
It is difficult to say whether BR would have handled the present dispute any
differently - striking railmen brought BR services to a halt in April 1993 -
but in the 2 1/2 months since its creation Railtrack has established a
reputation for driving a hard bargain.
The train operating companies have complained that Railtrack has negotiated
tough terms in its access contracts. Some have said that the penalties on
Railtrack for failing to keep lines open are too light.
According to the RMT, Railtrack has adopted a similarly tough approach to
its industrial relations.
Discussions with the unions - formal negotiations were not begun, it
insisted - were handled by a four-person team led by Mr Chris Leah, director
of Railtrack's north-west zone. Mr Leah, 46, was previously BR's north-west
regional director.
Behind Railtrack's industrial relations team, however, stand Mr Horton and
his board. Mr Horton acquired a formidable reputation during his 35 years at
BP for cutting the fat out of the businesses he ran.
But a sharp decline in profits during the recession and an acquired
reputation for arrogance prompted his fellow directors to cast him out.
On arriving at Railtrack Mr Horton was keen to allay fears that he would
prove a second Doctor Beeching, the British Railways chairman who made
swingeing cuts to the network in the 1960s.
Speaking just before the formal launch of Railtrack on April 1, Mr Horton
described the rail network as 'a priceless national asset which we have
jolly well got to make good use of'. But it is clear that the modernisation
of Railtrack's part of the old BR will involve a tough approach to
cost-cutting. One priority is reducing the Pounds 1.8bn annual cost of
maintaining the rail network.
Altering railway practices which have become entrenched over the 47 years of
government ownership will take time and Mr Horton said he did not expect to
make big changes in the first year of the new management. But the challenge
posed by the signalmen may mean that decisions may have to be taken far
sooner than expected.

FT  15 JUN 94 / Scottish Nuclear warms to sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Scottish Nuclear, the state-owned company which runs Scotland's nuclear
power stations, indicated yesterday that it now favours the idea of being
privatised. The company has been less enthusiastic than Nuclear Electric,
its counterpart in England and Wales.
Mr James Hann, chairman, criticised the government yesterday for slowing its
progress towards becoming a commercial company by the 'totally unnecessary'
delay to its plans to store nuclear waste at its power stations. He said:
'It really does seem that every time our industry tries to move forward it
is being halted in its tracks as a result of operating in the public sector.
'If remaining in the public sector is going to seriously hinder our progress
and potentially thwart our attempts to find the finance for new plants in
the future, then partial or even full privatisation may indeed be the way
forward.'
SNL cooled towards privatisation last autumn after its merchant bank warned
of flotation and trade-sale difficulties. Last month Mr Hann told the
Scotland on Sunday newspaper that outright privatisation would 'wreck the UK
nuclear industry as it stands'. He feared that private investors would be
unwilling to fund new nuclear plants.
Mr Hann's change of heart follows last month's decision by Mr Ian Lang,
Scottish secretary, to defer a decision on construction of a dry store for
spent fuel at the Torness power station in East Lothian. Mr Lang is to wait
until the environment department finishes its own review of
radioactive-waste strategy, which will consider whether Britain should have
a single dry store for nuclear waste, or stores at individual plants.
SNL is particularly aggrieved over the delay because it thought it was doing
what the government wanted in reducing its operating costs.
SNL announced a 9 per cent increase in net profit to Pounds 72m in the year
to March 31 compared with Pounds 66m in 1992-93. Turnover rose from Pounds
524m to Pounds 537m. Output fell from 14.3m to 14.2m terawatt hours because
of engineering work to extend the life of its plants.

FT  15 JUN 94 / Gooda underwriting was unsustainable: Former chairman admits
survival of agency depended on absence of catastrophes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The underwriting policy adopted by Mr Derek Walker, the former chairman of
the Gooda Walker managing agency, was 'unsustainable', he agreed in the High
Court yesterday.
Gooda Walker's syndicate 290, which specialised in high-risk insurance
underwritten by Mr Walker, was unable to cope with a series of catastrophes,
he admitted.
Mr Walker was giving evidence in the High Court action brought by more than
3,000 Lloyd's Names who allege incompetence by the agents, who they are
suing for Pounds 629m.
Questioned by Mr Geoffrey Vos QC, for the Names, Mr Walker said the
frequency of losses in the excess loss market - including Hurricane Hugo and
a storm in the UK - was responsible for the substantial losses suffered by
the syndicate in 1990.
'So, was your writing generally, your syndicate's business, really dependent
on there not being catastrophes?' Mr Vos asked.
'Yes,' Mr Walker replied.
'And we see that when there are catastrophes, the business is destroyed?'
'Correct,' Mr Walker said.
Later, Mr Walker agreed with the judge, Mr Justice Phillips, that he wrote
lines of insurance assuming that they would not be claimed against.
Mr Vos suggested that his underwriting strategy was therefore unsustainable.
'Correct,' Mr Walker said.
Mr Walker agreed that in spite of experience with Hurricane Hugo, when
claims exceeded reinsurance levels, he decided not to increase the
reinsurance for syndicate 290.
Mr Vos asked: 'You did not think there was any need to increase your
reinsurance?'
Mr Walker replied: 'I would not have been able to increase it.'
Mr Vos: 'So, it was a matter of the cart driving the horse, in the sense
that you could not have done anyway, even if you wanted to?'
Mr Walker: 'I think that would be the position, yes.'
Mr Walker agreed that in the case of syndicate 164, there was nothing in the
published accounts from 1982 onwards to warn the syndicate was high risk. Mr
Vos later accused Mr Walker of exaggerating when he claimed he and his
family had been ruined when they lost Pounds 1.5m on the insurance market.
Mr Walker agreed that in 1988, 1989 and 1990 he, his wife and son had been
paid a total of Pounds 1.9m by Gooda Walker.

FT  15 JUN 94 / Channel 5 plan aims for 63% of population
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is finalising plans that would allow a fifth television
channel to go ahead, capable of reaching about 63 per cent of population.
This is the shape of an emerging compromise which would both allow a Channel
5 using existing analogue technology and keep open the possibility of
developing digital terrestrial television.
The original plan produced by the Independent Television Commission
envisaged the channel reaching about 74 per cent of the population on two
channels - 35 and 37.
The new plan, following Radio Communications Agency research and talks
between the Department of National Heritage and the Department of Trade and
Industry, would use channel 37 and other local frequencies in cities such as
Glasgow and Manchester.
Extensive retuning of video recorders would probably be necessary,
particularly in London.
It is not clear whether the final Channel 5 plan can be cleared by civil
servants and ministers in time for the ITC's next meeting on June 23.
Time Warner, the world's largest media group, is prepared to go ahead with a
bid on the basis of a channel that would reach more than 60 per cent of the
population.
The ITC is concerned, however, that there may be considerable delay in
getting approval for the use of the extra frequencies that would take the
reach of the channel up from about 50 per cent to more than 60 per cent.
Potential bidders talk of considerable enthusiasm among programme makers,
advertisers and potential local operators for a new Channel 5 and there is
considerable frustration at what is seen as unreasonable delay in
government.
The ITC decided in February that it wanted to advertise the channel and
asked the government whether the frequencies were still available.
Three groups have expressed interest. The Time Warner consortium includes
MAI, the group that controls Meridian Broadcasting and Anglia Television,
and Pearson, owner of the Financial Times. The others are NBC, the US
network company, and Mr Richard Branson's Virgin Group.

FT  15 JUN 94 / Housing cash plan 'no solution'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Abolition of restrictions on how cash raised through the sale of council
houses can be used to build new homes for rent will provide no long-term
solution to the housing shortage, according to a report published today.
The release of local authority capital receipts has been at the centre of
Labour party policies to increase the supply of council homes and create
jobs in the construction industry.
A report from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, the social research
organisation, says that the receipts are concentrated in areas where there
are high council house sales, not in areas with the greatest housing need.
The report says the only realistic way to increase investment in low-cost
housing for rent without increasing government borrowing is for council
housing to be transferred to local housing companies. These would be outside
the public sector and able to borrow against the security of the existing
stock to finance repairs and new homes.
An analysis of how local authorities spent the Pounds 900m released in the
'capital receipts holiday' after the 1992 autumn statement shows that local
authorities are often tempted to use the money for other purposes.
The report says about Pounds 200m of the receipts released were diverted to
investments such as leisure centres and town hall projects.

FT  15 JUN 94 / New Parents' Charter costs Pounds 3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
About Pounds 3m is to be spent on producing a revised Parents' Charter and
sending it to every household in England and Wales, Mr John Patten, the
education secretary, said yesterday.
The charter sets out a new 'annual report' which parents will receive in
June or July each year, providing local and national benchmarks for surplus
places, staying-on rates, and examination performance against which their
own children's schools can be judged.
The new report, which will be distributed through schools, is added to a
series of existing rights to information which the charter gives to parents.
These include an annual report from the school about their child's progress,
a report about the school once every four years from Ofsted, the
government's independent inspectorate, national 'league tables' for schools
and local education authorities, and an annual prospectus from each school.
The Parents' Charter includes no guarantees for redress, however. Mr Patten
said that pupils' ability was so variable that schools could not be required
to educate every child to a given level of qualifications. But it sets out
parents' rights of appeal if they fail to find a place for their child in
their first-choice school, and also sets out voting rights for electing
boards of governors.
Parent's duties are also included. Mr Patten said: 'Discipline begins at
home. Children learn a great deal in their earliest years. This means that
parents, relatives and friends have a big responsibility.'
Parents' organisations reacted angrily to the expense involved. The National
Confederation of Parent-Teacher Associations complained that the government
had failed to give parents the right to set up their own association without
a headteacher's consent.
The Campaign for State Education, a pressure group, launched a rival charter
which laid down requirements for educational inputs, as well as outputs. It
would limit class sizes to a maximum of 30, and require a guarantee that all
buildings were safe.
Ms Margaret Tulloch, secretary of Case, said that varying provision between
local authorities meant state education was a 'lottery'. 'Parents should be
able to know that when they send their child to school, no matter where it
is, they can expect the same minimum standards on class sizes and
equipment,' she said.

FT  15 JUN 94 / Siemens wins power deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
National Power, the privatised electricity generator, has awarded to Siemens
of Germany a fiercely contested contract to build a 1,350MW gas-fired power
station at Didcot in Oxfordshire.
The turnkey contract for the design, construction and commissioning of the
plant is valued at less than Pounds 400m. Mr John Baker, National Power's
chief executive, said yesterday that he believed it was the UK's most
competitive power plant project.
Announcement of the award comes a few days after PowerGen, the UK's other
big electricity generator, said it was paying Pounds 441m in advance for its
gas-fired power station at Connah's Quay, North Wales, which is being built
by the Anglo-French GEC Alsthom engineering group.
The Didcot B contract is the first for Siemens from National Power, whose
other combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) stations have been ordered from
Zurich-based Asea Brown Boveri and GEC Alsthom.
But the German company has built two gas-fired stations for PowerGen, and Mr
Juergen Gehrels, chief executive of Siemens in the UK, said yesterday: 'We
believe that our successful track record in delivering total turnkey
projects, on time and to budget, was a key factor in (National Power's)
decision.'
National Power is clearly delighted with the deal it has struck with Siemens
 -two years ago, it was thought the station would cost about Pounds 450m.
But the contract has been held up by a public inquiry and the UK
government's review of the coal industry.
Didcot B is scheduled to be the largest and most efficient of National
Power's CCGT stations, and will be built in two separate modules alongside
the existing 2,000MW coal-fired station at Didcot. Commercial operation is
due to start in 1997.
The new station is the next step in National Power's programme to upgrade
its generating capacity with about 5,000MW of CCGT plant by the end of the
decade, to meet tightening environmental standards.

FT  15 JUN 94 / Car importer leaves Pounds 27m in will
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr David Brown, the former mechanic who founded Proton Cars (UK), the
importer of Malaysian cars, left an estate of more than Pounds 27m.
Mr Brown, a friend of the Malaysian royal family who is believed to have
played an informal mediating role between the British and Malaysian
governments over the Pergau Dam affair, died of a cerebral haemorrhage while
riding an exercise cycle at his home in Grappenhall, Cheshire, in April. He
was 45.
His estate was valued at Pounds 27.1m gross, Pounds 25m net, with bequests
in his will to various members of his family.
Mr Brown, a burly, extrovert figure with a robust sense of humour seemingly
at odds with his reputation for secrecy, was on the point of taking Proton
into a new market.
Having turned Proton Cars (UK), in which he was the majority shareholder,
into the fastest growing new car franchise ever launched in Britain - it has
already sold about 70,000 units since its start in 1987 - Mr Brown was
poised to lead Proton into continental European markets.
He was to do so as majority shareholder of Proton Cars Europe (PCE), a joint
venture with the manufacturer and EON Corporation, its distributor in
Malaysia.
The fate of his 55 per cent shareholding in PCE is not yet clear, but Mr
Peter King, Proton UK's managing director, said yesterday that PCE was
pressing ahead with co-ordinating the Continental debut of Proton cars,
starting with the French market in October.
Unlike the conventional import and distribution operations of Proton Cars
(UK), PCE will choose and co-ordinate the activities of independent
distributors in mainland Europe.
Mr Brown started his career with a garage under railway arches at
Warrington, building up a chain of dealerships under the umbrella of the

FT  15 JUN 94 / CBI chief applauds Labour's altered stance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ, PHILIP STEPHENS, JIMMY BURNS and DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Labour party had 'changed in important ways', Mr Howard Davies,
director-general of the Confederation of British Industry said yesterday.
Mr Davies said in a speech to business leaders in London: 'It would be
churlish not to recognise that the Labour party has changed in important
ways and is offering a set of policies which, at the very least, deserve our
attention. We shall give it.'
The party still had a number of policies with which the CBI disagreed, such
as its commitments to the social chapter of the Maastricht treaty and a
statutory minimum wage.
But, in one of the strongest indications yet of the rapprochement between
Labour and industry, Mr Davies said: 'It seems very likely that we shall be
facing a Labour leadership without any baggage from previous episodes in
power, and with a set of economic policies rather different from those which
held sway in the people's party for most of the 1980s.'
His comments came as Mr Tony Blair, the front-runner for the Labour
leadership, underlined once again his commitment to turn Labour into the
party of 'law and order'.
Mr Blair said in a lecture to the Police Foundation at London's Guildhall
that his party's strategy to combat crime would be based on restoring the
sense of responsibility and respect, among young people in particular.
In government Labour would seek to provide the opportunity for individual
self-advancement but with that chance would come the 'duties of
citizenship'. Mr Blair's speech was applauded by an audience which included
many of the country's top police officers. Mr John Burrow, chief constable
of Essex, said: 'Mr Blair is clearly a politician who listens to what the
police are saying.'
Chief Superintendent David Golding, national president of the Police
Superintendents Association of England and Wales, said Mr Blair was in touch
with widespread dissatisfaction within the police force with the way the
government pushed through legislation without adequate consultation.
The first union to nominate a candidate in the Labour leadership contest has
backed Mr Tony Blair for leader with Mr John Prescott as his deputy, David
Goodhart writes.
The Iron and Steel Trades Confederation, which has about 50,000 members, may
not set a trend among union leaders, many of whom remain suspicious of Mr
Blair. However, some Blair supporters in the unions have not ruled out a
nomination from one of the large unions, possibly even the GMB general
union, which is holding its conference in Blackpool this week, is expected
to decide tomorrow whether to make a recommendation.

FT  15 JUN 94 / House sales fall by 10% over year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
House sales last month fell by more than a tenth compared with May last year
according to a survey of more than 4,000 estate agents' offices handling
about a half of all sales.
The survey by the Ombudsman for Corporate Estate Agents (OCEA), covering 26
of the largest estate agency chains, provides further evidence of a sharp
setback in the housing recovery.
Mr Peter Constable, OCEA's chairman, blamed tax increases and the
introduction of higher interest rates for fixed-rate mortgages for a 12.4
per cent decline in net sales compared with May last year.
Sales were also 4.9 per cent lower than April this year. A sale is recorded
if finance has been arranged, solicitors have been instructed and no chain
is involved, according to OCEA, which began compiling figures in 1991.
Mr Constable said new instructions were 2.6 per cent lower than a year ago
and 6.5 per cent lower than the previous month. He said: 'The earlier froth
has now been eliminated from the market by tax increases and by the
hardening of interest rates for fixed rate mortgages.'

FT  15 JUN 94 / Ministers at loggerheads over timetable for legislation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ministers are considering including fresh legislation to reform the Child
Support Agency in next year's legislative timetable.
The debate over its reform is taking place at a time of wide-ranging
differences between cabinet ministers on whether plans for virtually all
radical legislation should be shelved in favour of measures designed to
rebuild a reputation for competent government.
With the process of whittling down the long list of bills proposed by
individual government departments about to start in earnest, proponents of
various controversial measures are arguing that the next parliamentary
session provides the last chance to enact proposals before the next general
election.
In addition, with an election likely in 1996, they believe it is too risky
to leave projects such as CSA reform, Post Office privatisation and an
'omnibus' privatisation bill (which would remove the need for separate
'paving' legislation before each sale of public assets) until the session
starting in autumn 1995.
But their views are opposed by consolidators. In the case of the Child
Support Agency the consolidators argue that it is not yet clear what changes
need to be made.
Earlier this year the government introduced a number of modifications in the
way the agency functions. These included enabling absent fathers facing big
increases in maintenance to pay bills in stages. Mr Peter Lilley, social
security secretary, has said he is determined not to be 'rushed into
further, inappropriate changes'.
With the government already committed to a wide-ranging pensions bill, the
next session could be a busy one in the Commons for social security
ministers.
They are also expected to share responsibility with colleagues in the
Department of Employment for a bill implementing the proposed job seekers'
allowance, to replace income support and unemployment benefit from 1996.
Other likely candidates for inclusion are a bill paving the way for the
abolition of Health Service regional authorities and another criminal
justice bill related to alleged miscarriages of justice.
Officials expect this to be much more tightly drafted than this year's
criminal justice bill, which was used by MPs to force votes on a range of
home affairs-related issues.
Ministers are also considering whether to include a bill setting up a new
environmental protection agency, in line with a manifesto commitment, and a
Northern Ireland police bill, in a move that would be welcomed by unionists.
A housing reform bill - probably including the abolition of rules allowing
people classed as 'statutorily homeless' to receive an automatic right to a
council house - is a further candidate, as is a bill to bring British Summer
Time into line with European time.
Government business managers involved in drafting next year's timetable face
the added complication of needing to make allowance for a European bill to
permit the enlargement of the Union.
There is still no indication of when ministers will be able to come forward
with legislation, included in the last Queen's Speech, giving force to
changes in the European Union's system of own resources. This will increase
Britain's contribution to the EU budget in line with the agreement reached
at the Edinburgh European Council in December 1992. It will be opposed by
Eurosceptics.
Officials suggest the government may seek to increase its room for manoeuvre
by omitting any explicit reference to Child Support Agency reform from the
Queen's Speech but including the usual catch-all clause committing the
government to 'other measures'.
This would increase pressure on business managers to keep short the list of
bills specifically identified in the speech.

FT  15 JUN 94 / Hollow ring in cheers for PM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was probably the worst series of electoral setbacks to hit the
Conservative party this century. But if Tory MPs were panicking yesterday,
they were keeping it to themselves.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, was given a louder than usual cheer,
backed by mass waving of order papers, as he entered the Commons for
question time.
But it was not clear whether the good humour was prompted by relief at the
party's escape from total disaster in the European elections or
acknowledgement that Mr Major needs all the help he can get.
There was some griping in private from one or two of the more bitterly
estranged right-wingers, for whom the prime minister has become a figure to
be removed at all costs.
One senior rightwing backbencher said that most Tory MPs had been fooled by
Conservative Central Office propaganda into regarding the European election
result as a victory.
He said the effect was similar to the relief that swept the Conservative
party after the 1990 local government elections, when Central Office
disguised the scale of Tory losses by hailing the retention of Westminster
as a triumph.
'It will disappear by the autumn, and Major will be in deep trouble again,'
he said.
A prominent Eurosceptic MP also said that he would continue to argue against
the Maastricht treaty and further European integration in spite of Mr
Major's adoption during the campaign of a more sceptical tone on Europe.
But most rightwingers said that pressure on the prime minister would ease
because he appeared to be the most sceptical of the available candidates.
Most Conservative MPs seemed willing to give the prime minister the benefit
of the doubt, even those whose seats in the south and south-west of England
are vulnerable to Labour or Liberal Democrat challenges.
One west country MP said that he was relieved by Labour's good performance,
which he believed might help him to retain his seat by splitting the vote at
the next general election.
'I would have been much more worried if Labour voters had gone over to the
Liberal Democrats. The biggest danger to me is tactical voting, so if voters
are going to stick by their own parties, things are looking up for us,' he
said.
Other southern MPs drew comfort from the high proportion of Conservative
supporters who appeared to have abstained in the European elections rather
than switching to the opposition parties.
'We have to do three things: stop arguing about Europe, make a clear
commitment to get taxes down, and stop sniping at the prime minister. If we
can do that, we can still win the next election,' said one.

FT  15 JUN 94 / Spurs hit by Cup ban and big fine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tottenham Hotspur was last night banned from the FA Cup for a year and fined
Pounds 600,000. In addition, 12 points were docked from its score next
season.
The penalty, the biggest ever imposed by the Football Association, was over
irregular payments to players.
The FA also ordered the north London club - which was saved from financial
disaster in 1991 by Mr Alan Sugar's injection of cash when he formed the
then 'dream ticket' with club manager Terry Venables - to pay the costs of
its investigation. The FA looked at 40 charges relating to loans made to
players in the 1980s.
Mr Sugar, the chairman, Mr Colin Sandy, Tottenham's financial director, and
Mr Peter Barnes, the club secretary, spent several hours at yesterday's
hearing held at Wembley, before the fine was announced. Previously, the
largest fine for a similar offence was Pounds 105,000 imposed on Chelsea in
1991.
The punishment is a severe financial setback to the club, which only just
escaped relegation to the first division last season. The loss from FA Cup
exclusion, with possible relegation next season - which will be more
difficult to avoid starting with a 12-point deficit - could amount to
millions.
Mr Bernie Kingsley, co-ordinator of the Tottenham Independent Supporters'
Association, last night demanded that the FA clarify its ruling. He said:
'The FA needs to make absolutely clear which charges Tottenham is guilty of
and who they consider responsible so the club can take its own action.'
The FA has said only that it found Tottenham guilty of a range of irregular
payments. Mr Kingsley also argued that loans were not against the
association's rules and that the breach was technical, in that they were not
reported.
Tottenham Hotspur shares have slid as the FA hearing has approached.
Yesterday, with the market closed before the fine was announced, the price
stood at 80p.
The hearing comes just more than a year after Mr Sugar went to the High
Court to oust Mr Venables, now the England coach, from his position as chief
executive of Tottenham.
A Tottenham spokesman said last night that the club was shocked at the
ruling's severity, and added: 'Spurs provided all the information on the
offences - all of which took place before Alan Sugar took control -
voluntarily.'
Mr Sugar said: 'I was always brought up to believe honesty is the best
policy, and have followed that throughout my career. The punishment dished
out today is a bitter pill to swallow if you adopt that policy as I have
done.'

FT  15 JUN 94 / CAA partly to blame for error
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The failure of the Civil Aviation Authority to implement recommended changes
in lighting systems at London's Gatwick airport was yesterday held partly
responsible for an incident last year when an airliner mistakenly landed on
a taxiway.
The crew of an Air Malta Boeing 737 with 101 people on board misinterpreted
ground lights operating during a night landing and touched down on a
parallel taxiway instead of the stand-by runway. Disaster was avoided
because the taxiway was empty.
A report published by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch of the
Department of Transport says the mistake, which was principally attributed
to pilot error, provided grounds for 'serious concern'. It calls for a
second review of Gatwick's lighting systems.

Allied Dunbar, the life company, has been told by the Advertising Standards
Authority to withdraw an advertisement featuring a funeral because of the
'severe distress' it caused some readers.
The advertisement, headlined 'Every two minutes someone dies of heart
disease', pictured a burial service viewed from the bottom of a grave
looking upwards, with mourners and a priest looking down. The ASA said 15
complaints were received from people who found the advertisement 'emotive,
in extreme bad taste, an appeal to fear, and distressing'.
Separately, the ASA upheld a complaint against Allied Dunbar over its direct
mailing. The complainant objected to the continual receipt of unrequested
mailings, even though he had been assured by the company that his details
were on a 'no contact' list.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Further measures to relieve the burden of competition laws on businesses
were announced yesterday by Mr Neil Hamilton, deregulation minister, Robert
Rice writes.
The government proposes to cut the maximum time allowed for ministers to
consider whether to refer a pre-notified merger to the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission for full investigation from 45 days to 35 days.
It is also planning to relieve small businesses from the burden of
investigation for anti-competitive conduct under the 1980 Competition Act by
raising the turnover threshold below which they escape scrutiny from Pounds
5m to Pounds 10m.
The government has rejected a call by MPs to give the proposed new
deregulation committee the power to summon ministers. It said in response to
a report by the Commons procedure committee that the power would be
'unprecedented' and 'unnecessary'.

FT  15 JUN 94 / Clarke set to impose more spending cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kenneth Clarke will today warn cabinet colleagues in charge of
Whitehall's big spending departments to expect a further round of cuts in
their budgets.
His stance will foreshadow the third consecutive year of tight public-sector
pay restraint and the possibility of a new batch of measures to curb the
Pounds 85bn social security budget.
Amid calls from the Tory right for an early government commitment to tax
cuts, the chancellor is preparing to use his speech at the Mansion House to
tighten the framework for this summer's spending round.
The main thrust of his annual speech to bankers will seek to underline the
government's seriousness about sticking to its medium-term inflation target.
The Treasury wants to dispel any idea in the financial markets that recent
differences in emphasis between Mr Clarke and Mr Eddie George, the governor
of the Bank of England, might represent a softening in the government's
resolve.
In spite of calls from rightwing cabinet ministers for early tax cuts, the
Treasury is dismissing suggestions it might abandon the second stage of the
imposition of value added tax on domestic fuel.
But Mr Clarke is keen to impress on cabinet colleagues that the overall
spending figures which were set out in his Budget last November represented
'ceilings' rather than targets for the government's spending.
The Treasury set a global Whitehall figure of Pounds 263bn for 1995-96 and
Pounds 272bn for 1996-97, representing increases in real terms of less than
1 per cent each year.
But Mr Clarke believes the improved inflation outlook since last autumn
allows for a further reduction in the cash figures and the establishment of
a still tougher target for 1997-98.
The cabinet's EDX spending committee is due to report to the full cabinet
next week. The Treasury wants that meeting to endorse its strategy of a
tighter squeeze.
But ministers close to EDX said that because of higher-than-predicted
increases in 'demand-led' expenditure in areas such as social security and
education, cash reductions will be required in other departmental budgets.
Some ministers want Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, to take
fresh action to contain his budget, with tighter limits on the growth in
housing benefits and curbs on mortgage interest payments for the unemployed.
Others are voicing frustration at the Treasury's unwillingness to ease the
pressure on spending by relaxing the present constraints on private-sector
involvement in public-sector projects.

FT  15 JUN 94 / When working would cost too much: Nancy Dunne on a family
which Clinton's welfare reforms are designed to assist
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Little John, unlike most American children, has both his parents at home.
His father, Mr Tony Wilson, a roofer, was badly injured in March 1991 when a
scaffolding collapsed and he fell three storeys to the ground, breaking his
back. Little John's mother, Mrs Maria Craig, is on welfare.
Mr Wilson and Mrs Craig are now trapped in the 'safety net' which the US and
state government provides to keep citizens from absolute poverty. It is
people like them President Bill Clinton hopes to help with his welfare
reform initiative, unveiled yesterday.
Mr Wilson receives payments from Maryland's workers compensation fund, a
scheme funded by the state's businesses but riddled with bureaucratic
sandtraps. Although his medical bills were paid, Mr Wilson received no
income for the first 18 months after his accident.
After four trips to court, he now collects Dollars 10,816 (Pounds 7,163) a
year, although in theory he is supposed to be getting two-thirds of his
pre-accident pay. Mr Wilson said he was earning Dollars 500 a week before
his accident but he had been working in that job for only two weeks.
The stereotypical welfare mother of politicians' demonology is a black
ghetto-dweller who has a baby every year. Mrs Craig, however, is much more
representative, according to welfare experts. Like the majority of welfare
recipients, she is white. Along with an eight-year-old daughter, Ashley, she
was deserted by her husband five years ago. She has never been able to
afford a divorce. No member of her family has been on the welfare rolls
before.
From the age of 18, for more than 12 years, she worked for one employer, an
optician, fitting eyeglasses. When she left the job to have the baby, whose
birth was unplanned, she was earning Dollars 22,000 a year.
The state's welfare system provides her with Dollars 3,432 in cash and
Dollars 1,428 in food stamps taking the couple's earnings to a total of
Dollars 15,676. It is barely above the poverty line - calculated at Dollars
14,764 for a family of four - but there are powerful disincentives to her
returning to work.
At present she and her daughter are eligible for Medicaid, the medical care
programme for the 'working poor'. Yet she would lose all these benefits and
her welfare payments if she found a job.
Mrs Craig could earn some additional money caring for other children, but
would also lose her welfare cheque. She could go back to fitting spectacles,
but she says the Dollars 150 a week she would have to pay for childcare
(since Mr Wilson is often unable to carry the baby) and the Dollars 240 a
month she would have to pay for health insurance would actually reduce her
earnings.
Even now, neither Mr Wilson nor Little John get Medicaid benefits. The
workmen's compensation fund covers only healthcare related to Mr Wilson's
injury. The baby is not covered because his father is in the home.
This leads to Mrs Craig's skipping the baby's scheduled visits to the doctor
unless he needs immunisation shots or is ill. 'I try not to think about the
possibility of him getting sick, but when he shows symptoms - like an ear
infection - I get petrified,' she says.
Mrs Craig would be an ideal candidate for the welfare reform retraining
programme proposed by Mr Clinton yesterday. A high school graduate, she said
she would, if given the chance, study for a two-year college degree which
would enable her to earn a higher salary. The retraining programme would
also pay childcare expenses and allow recipients to retain their healthcare
benefits.
Meanwhile, the workmen's compensation fund has dithered. Mr Wilson has been
waiting for months for back surgery, which his doctors see as his only hope
of recovery. The workmen's compensation's doctor disagrees; the fund likes
to avoid expensive surgeries.
'I had the physical body of a packhorse,' he said. I thought I would always
have it. Instead I have to sit here getting stupider every day. Sometimes I
go fishing. Sometimes I'm suicidal. I see it as an easy way out.'

<TEXT>
Argentina's military commanders have reacted angrily to the surprise
announcement last week by President Carlos Menem that he will abolish
compulsory military service next year.
No general has openly attacked Mr Menem's plans but officers are irritated
by his political motivations in ending conscription and the air of
improvisation in the decision.
A defence ministry official said yesterday: 'The army has always wished to
become a professional force, but it will require a four- or five-year
transition.'
But Mr Rosendo Fraga, a defence analyst, commented: 'Military organisations
everywhere are reluctant to change. The generals and defence ministry are
dragging their feet.'
Resentment in the armed forces has increased as the government raises wages
of its civilian employees while holding down military wages. General Martn
Balza, the army commander, earns the equivalent of Dollars 2,344 a month; a
senior civil servant earns twice as much.
But Mr Fraga said moving swiftly to a professional force should be neither
difficult nor costly. The Argentine armed forces have only 18,700 conscripts
and to put volunteers in their place would require only a 5 per cent
increase in the Dollars 4.7bn defence budget.
Opposition to the deeply unpopular 12-month military service for 18-year-old
men, picked at random, has deepened after the unsolved murder in March of Mr
Omar Carrasco, a conscript at an artillery unit. An opinion poll published
yesterday showed that 61 per cent of Argentines oppose military service.
Mr Menem's decision is very popular. He is reforming Argentina's 1853
constitution so that he may run next year for a second successive term as
president, but his administration has been adrift in recent months. He has
now skilfully regained the initiative, turning a potential crisis to his
political advantage.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Welfare recipients born after 1971 will be limited to two years of cash
benefits in their lifetime, writes George Graham.
After two years, they would be required to enrol in a one-year work
programme sponsored by the government. They could re-enrol in work
programmes so long as they continued to look for work. Anyone who turned
down a job or did not make adequate efforts to look for work could have his
or her benefits stopped.
Over the next five years, the plan is expected to cost a total of Dollars
10.8bn (Pounds 7.2bn), including:
Dollars 2.8bn for education, training and job placement.
Dollars 1.2bn for work programmes for those who reach the two-year limit.
Dollars 4.2bn for childcare for those in training and work programmes, as
well as for other workers with low incomes.
Dollars 900m for measures to improve the system of collecting child support
payments from parents and for teenage pregnancy prevention.
A reduction in the number of people in the welfare system is expected to
save Dollars 1.5bn over the same five-year period. The remaining Dollars
9.3bn of costs would be made up by measures such as:
Tightening restrictions on foreigners receiving benefits such as aid to
families with dependent children (AFDC), social security pensions or food
stamps, to save Dollars 3.7bn.
Putting a ceiling on each state's spending in the AFDC emergency
homelessness programme, to save Dollars 1.6bn.
Limiting social security disability payments to drug and alcohol addicts so
as to save Dollars 800m.
Ending agricultural subsidies to farmers with more than Dollars 100,000 a
year in non-farm income so as to save Dollars 500m.
Shifting Dollars 1.6bn of savings from the superfund for cleaning up toxic
waste dumps.

</HEADLINE>

   By GEORGE GRAHAM

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Senior members of the US Congress have launched intensive discussions on
ways to break their impasse over the overhaul of the US healthcare system by
suspending the compulsory elements of a reform for several years to see
whether voluntary measures can do the job.
Opposition Republicans have so far resisted the key element of President
Bill Clinton's healthcare reform plan, which would require employers to
provide health insurance for their workers and pay for 80 per cent of its
cost.
But, at a White House meeting yesterday morning, Senator Daniel Moynihan,
chairman of the Senate finance committee, and Senator Robert Packwood, the
senior Republican on the committee, began discussions with Mr Clinton on
possible methods by which the employer mandate would be triggered only if
vountary measures had failed to bring health care to all.
Both senators warned, however, that there was at the moment no majority in
their committee for any healthcare plan.
They said that Mr Clinton had asked them not to press for an immediate vote
on his plan, which in its current shape would be defeated.
Republicans and Democrats in Congress have accepted to a large extent the
president's goal of universal health coverage in the US, but most
Republicans and many Democrats have been reluctant to accept the degree of
compulsion necessary to achieve that goal.
Since almost all large US companies already provide health insurance to
their workers, the Clinton plan's employer mandate would be largely targeted
at small businesses, which are a cherished constituency for members of
Congress.
As a possible compromise, various senators have been discussing different
forms of trigger: a hard trigger, which would implement the employer mandate
if, after a certain number of years, the US had not achieved 95 to 97 per
cent coverage, or a soft one, which would merely sound an alarm but not
bring any automatic action if this target were not reached.
Administration officials have rejected soft triggers as inadequate, but
appear to be open to the idea of hard triggers.
Many members of Congress, however, view hard triggers with suspicion.
'Triggers are for guns, not legislation,' said Congressman Sam Gibbons,
chairman of the House of Representatives ways and means committee.
At the White House meeting yesterday, Senator Packwood floated a possible
compromise based on the fast-track procedures adopted to facilitate trade
treaty negotiations or military base closures, whereby Congress must vote
yes or no, but cannot amend the proposal.
'There was interest in the fast-track concept,' Senator Packwood said.
He added, however, that the division came over whether the mechanism should
more closely resemble a trade treaty, whereby Congress must vote yes before
it can take effect, or a base closure, which takes effect automatically
unless Congress votes no within a fixed period.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Clinton administration is to undertake a further shake-up of its foreign
affairs team, with a complete reshuffle of personnel in charge of European
policy.
Mr Richard Holbrooke, a senior diplomat in the Carter administration and now
the US ambassador to Germany, will be recalled to replace Mr
Stephen Oxman, the assistant secretary of state for European and Canadian
affairs.
This is likely to be seen as one more old Washington hand taking the place
of another friend of President Bill Clinton, because Mr Oxman attended Yale
law school with the president.
Also, Mr Alexander Vershbow, Mr Oxman's deputy, will move to the White House
to take over from Ms Jenonne Walker as head of European affairs at the
National Security Council.
The positions are central to the formulation of the US administration's
policy on Bosnia, among other issues.
Ms Walker is to become ambassador to the Czech Republic, and Mr Oxman is
also expected to be offered an embassy.

Senate leaders told President Clinton that they could not reach consensus in
a committee on his healthcare reform plans, but they agreed to continue
their work, AP reports from Washington.
Recognising the lack of consensus in the Senate finance committee, 'the
president asked that we take no votes in the committee at the moment,' said
Senator Robert Packwood of Oregon, the committee's ranking Republican. 'He
obviously doesn't want any vote that causes his plan to be defeated,' Mr
Packwood said.
Committee Chairman Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan summed up the meeting:
'We agreed that . . . there is not now a majority for any healthcare reform
plan in the Senate Finance Committee, that we will continue to work on a
bipartisan basis to provide legislation that covers everybody.'
Such disagreements aside, Mr Moynihan insisted Clinton's healthcare reform
plan was not dead.
'Not at all. This a large piece of legislation and some of the principles
are absolutely essential. Others are negotiable and he knows that,' he said.
The crux of the problem lies in Mr Clinton's desire to guarantee coverage to
all Americans, with employers forced to provide insurance to their workers.
Mr Moynihan said the legislators would return to Capitol Hill to try 'to put
together combinations' of various proposals. Asked if Mr Clinton could
achieve universal coverage for all Americans without forcing employers to
buy insurance for their workers, Mr Moynihan said, 'We don't know yet.'

FT  15 JUN 94 / US likely to contribute to IMF facility
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US now seems likely to reverse an earlier move and make a contribution
this year to the International Monetary Fund's enhanced structural
adjustment facility (ESAF), which provides subsidised loans to some of the
world's poorest countries.
The willingness of the US Congress to provide the money is expected to be
increased by new signs from the IMF that it may move to release more of its
documents. Some economists and political analysts believe such a gesture
would greatly enhance government accountability for economic policy in some
of the countries that borrow from the IMF.
The Clinton administration has wanted to provide all the Dollars 100m
(Pounds 66m) it has pledged for the ESAF in its fiscal 1995 budget, which is
now under discussion in Congress, but a House of Representatives
appropriations committee eliminated the money from the foreign aid bill.
The Senate appropriations committee is expected, however, to restore Dollars
25m when it considers the bill tomorrow.
This follows efforts by a separate House committee, chaired by Congressman
Barney Frank of Massachusetts, to link approval of the ESAF money to
promises of greater transparency from the IMF.
Mr Frank's committee was expected to agree yesterday on legislation that
would authorise the appropriations committee to provide up to Dollars 25m
this year.
Mr Michel Camdessus, IMF managing director, this month wrote to his board
urging that the fund should not only release more of the documents over
which it has control, such as notes on recent economic developments in
borrowing countries, but also urge member countries to publish documents
such as their letters of intent for IMF loans.
The US contribution to the ESAF is not of any immediate financial
significance, since the IMF will not have to call on the US contribution for
another two years.
Even so, other contributors to the ESAF had made their pledges conditional
on the US, which is perpetually in arrears on its international obligations,
doing its share. Some Latin American countries were incensed at the House
committee's decision to strike the money from this year's budget.
The US was one of the last big industrialised countries to promise money to
the ESAF, which comprises an SDR4.5bn (Pounds 4.8bn) capital fund and a
separate SDR2bn fund to subsidise its interest rates, and its Dollars 100m
contribution was described even by the US Treasury as 'a meagre share for
the largest economy in the world.'

<TEXT>
A high-ranking Saudi diplomat at his country's United Nations mission sought
asylum in the US yesterday, after accusing his own government of human
rights abuses, terrorism and corruption.
Mr Mohammed al-Khilewi, a first secretary at the Saudi UN mission in New
York, signed an affidavit that he had 14,000 documents, some of them
classified, which reveal a history of terrorism and rights abuses by the
Saudi government.
Among the organisations which Mr Khilewi alleged his government was
supporting is Hamas, a radical Moslem group opposed to the peace accords
between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation. Mr Khilewi also
claimed the Saudi government had asked its UN mission to spy on two US
Jewish groups.
He further alleged that officials at both the UN mission and the Saudi
embassy in Washington had misused millions of dollars in official funds,
depositing them in New York banks and diverting the interest for personal
use.
The incident is unlikely to jeopardise US relations with Saudi Arabia,
considered Washington's closest Arab ally in the Middle East, but it could
embarrass both governments.
There has been no official comment from US or Saudi officials.
Mr Khilewi has received multiple threats, warning him to return to Saudi
Arabia or be killed, said Mr Michael Wildes, his attorney.

FT  15 JUN 94 / Consumer prices rise by 0.2% as retail sales fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The pace of US consumer spending slowed last month and inflationary
pressures remained modest, official figures indicated yesterday.
The Commerce Department said retail sales fell 0.2 per cent in cash terms
last month, but remained 6.4 per cent higher than in May last year. The
decline followed a revised 1.1 per cent drop in sales in April.
Consumer prices rose 0.2 per cent last month and by 2.3 per cent in the year
to May.
Both figures were weaker than analysts expected, but were in line with other
data pointing to a loss of economic vitality in recent months. The dip in
retail spending probably overstated the weakness of consumer spending, which
was artificially boosted last year by cash released from refinancing
mortgages at lower interest rates.
Recent softness mainly reflects a sharp fall in car sales after a very
strong first quarter. Spending may also have been depressed by higher tax
payments in April following implementation of last year's deficit-reduction
measures.
Mr David Rolley, senior economist at DRI/McGraw Hill, the forecasting group,
said he expected real consumer spending to grow at an annual rate of about 2
per cent in the second quarter, less than half the pace in the first three
months. Spending, however, would probably rebound in the third quarter given
strong recent increases in payroll employment, he said.
The 'core' consumer price index - which excludes the volatile elements food
and energy - rose 0.3 per cent last month and by 2.8 per cent in the year to
May. Core consumer price inflation rose at an annual rate of 3.4 per cent in
the past three months, indicating a slight deterioration in the underlying
trend.

Japan is to provide Malaysia with a MDollars 1.5bn (Pounds 386.6m) soft loan
for the construction of a new international airport south of Kuala Lumpur,
writes Kieran Cooke in Kuala Lumpur.
Mr Hideaki Tanaka, a director of Japan's Overseas Economic Co-operation Fund
(OECF), said that the loan would be charged at 3 per cent annual interest
repayable over 25 years. Final details are being worked out by Japanese and
Malaysian officials.
Kuala Lumpur's new airport, expected to cost of MDollars 13.5bn, is one of
south-east Asia's biggest infrastructure projects. Originally an
Anglo-Japanese consortium made up of Trafalgar House, GEC, Balfour Beatty,
Gammon and Marubeni of Japan were given the contract for the airport's
project management and development. However, the consortium has been
disbanded following Malaysian ban on giving government contracts to British
companies.

The foreign share of Japan's semiconductor market was 20.7 per cent in the
first quarter of 1994, unchanged from the fourth quarter of 1993 and
slightly above the 20 per cent target set in the second US-Japan
semiconductor trade agreement, signed in 1991, writes Louise Kehoe in San
Francisco.
Since the adoption of the first semiconductor trade agreement in 1986, which
for the first time established market share as a measure of market access,
the foreign share has risen by 8.5 per cent. However, over the past two
years the foreign share data have varied significantly from quarter to
quarter reaching a record high in the fourth quarter of 1993.
US semiconductor industry officials called for renewed efforts. We need to
'ensure that foreign access to the Japanese market moves beyond the 20 per
cent mark in order to realise the goal of a truly competitive Japanese
market,' said Andrew Procassini, president of the (US) Semiconductor
Industry Association. The trade agreement calls for 'gradual and steady
progress' through 1996, he noted.

The deal will be financed by a Dollars 2.3bn loan from a consortium of

The contract signing in Seoul concludes three years of negotiations that

GEC-Alsthom offered a low bid and extensive technology transfers to win the
contract to provide 46 locomotives which will run on a 410km track between
Seoul and the port city of Pusan. All but two of the trains will be
assembled or built in South Korea by three main subcontractors, including
Hyundai Precision &amp; Industry, Daewoo Heavy Industries and Hanjin Heavy

FT  15 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Australia investment rules probed - Nikki
Tait on a quest to take the whim factor out of foreign venture approval
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When an Australian parliamentary inquiry revealed last week that prime
minister Paul Keating had suggested three years ago that Mr Conrad Black,
the Canadian media tycoon, was more likely to be allowed to take control of
Australia's Fairfax newspaper group if it laid off 'barracking for' his
opponents, the prickly issue of foreign investment was placed firmly on the
political agenda.
For one thing, the idea that editorial parameters were tradable for an
investment position did not go down well. Even more serious was the question
of whether it was desirable that foreign investment decision-making should
be allowed to be subject to such political whim.
Foreign investment is a tricky enough issue for any relatively small
economy. And while there has been some unhappiness over the country's
relatively permissive investment rules, the main concerns centre - Mr
Keating's 'offer' aside - on the discretionary and often unaccountable way
in which the policies seem to be applied.
Under the spotlight is the Foreign Investment Review Board, a non-statutory
body, which has no published constitution or rules of procedure. In theory,
the Firb's job is to advise the Australian Treasurer (finance minister) on
the 3,000-4,000 foreign investment deals that arise each year, allowing the
latter to make the decision, at least in significant cases. (Firb itself
consists of four individuals, backed up by a number of officials operating
as a branch within the treasury).
But in reality, say investment bankers, big decisions are simply announced,
with a paucity of reasoning provided, and no indication of whether the
Treasurer has taken the advice of Firb officials, or acted for some
separate, perhaps politically-inspired, reason.
'It's excessively secretive,' says Mr Paul Binstead, former joint head of
Schroders' investment banking arm in Australia and currently moving to
County Natwest. 'Personally, I'd like to see decisions removed from the
political arena.'
Part of the problem is that the Firb operates in the context of a
permissive, but imprecise, regime. The country first introduced rules on
foreign investment in the mid-1970s, but then relaxed them significantly at
the end of the 1980s. In essence, the stance today is that foreign
investment is welcomed unless it is shown to be contrary to the national
interest - some would say a sensible, but discretionary standard.
In certain sensitive areas, such as the media, more precise rules apply. But
even these can shift. As the Senate committee's report on Fairfax noted with
regard to newspaper ownership: 'From a position of absolute restriction in
the early-1980s, the policy flirted with total liberalisation in the
late-1980s, before moving on to the compromise positions of foreign
shareholdings of 20 per cent in 1991 and 30 per cent in 1993.'
The Firb's formal scope, meanwhile, allows it to examine the acquisition of
any shareholding above 15 per cent in any company with assets of more than
ADollars 5m (Pounds 2.4m).
While agreeing that the current arrangements are not ideal, the multi-party
senate committee is split over what should be done. The opposition senators
are calling for a new, single foreign investment statute that brings
together the different exemptions or limitations applying to different
sectors (such as banking, media and so on). They fall short of demanding a
precise definition of 'national interest', but suggest that a set of
criteria to be used in determining applications by foreign investors be
delineated.
They would also like the Firb to become a statutory body, allowed to make
binding decisions for certain classes of applications which, in turn, would
be subject to administrative law review. The remaining, 'more significant'
applications would be handled by the the Treasurer, who would be obliged to
provide an accompanying statement of reasons in each case.
The Labor party senators, who made up a minority on the committee, are
content to recommend a 'more open and consultative process' and 'a
comprehensive system of notification, involving publication of significant
decisions, reasons for them and any special conditions'.
Either way, it seems likely that some changes will emerge. Mr Ralph Willis,
the Treasurer, has already conceded that 'for important issues . . . it's
not unreasonable that we should give some reasons'.
And that, say the system's critics, would at least be a step in the right
direction.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The German government yesterday submitted its formal offer to site the
future World Trade Organisation in Bonn, in a hopeful but probably forlorn
bid to tempt the WTO away from the Swiss city of Geneva, home of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
The German offer came just a day before the bid deadline, in a letter from
Mr Gunther Rexrodt, economics minister, to Mr Peter Sutherland, the Gatt
director-general, and Mr Andras Szepesi, chairman of the Gatt contracting
parties (members). A decision on the location of headquarters for the WTO,
which is due to supersede Gatt next January, is planned before the August
break.
No other contenders are expected. Singapore has denied it is a candidate
(though it hopes to host the first ministerial meeting of the WTO).
Details of the German and Swiss offers will be given to members of the WTO
preparatory committee today. German officials said yesterday that the WTO
had been offered eventual possession of the new federal parliament building
overlooking the Rhine once its present occupants moved to Berlin in 1998.
In the meantime, the WTO's 500-plus staff would be housed in a new building
close to the old parliamentary chamber which would serve as a meeting and
conference room.
Switzerland is offering Gatt's present lakeside headquarters and
construction of an adjoining conference room. The Swiss package also
includes more generous terms on immunities and privileges for WTO staff and
diplomatic missions than Gatt now enjoys, and a more relaxed approach to
granting work permits for family members - two important gripes among
Geneva's international community.
Although Bonn says it will pay towards removal costs, trade diplomats say
the expense and upheaval involved in moving from Geneva almost certainly
rule it out.
For many poor countries, the expense of establishing a new specialist
diplomatic mission in Bonn would be prohibitive, whereas in Geneva a single
mission can cover the range of international organisations. Gatt's present
staff has also shown a marked lack of enthusiasm for the idea.
Moreover, Germany's EU partners are unenthusiastic, especially France which
has already declared itself for francophone Geneva. 'The WTO's presence in
Geneva means French is one of the three working languages, which is good for
the influence of our country and our culture,' Mr Gerard Longuet, French
trade minister, told the French parliament last month.

FT  15 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Invisible trade exceeds 40%

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Global invisible transactions exceeded 40 per cent of total world trade for
the first time last year, reflecting several years in which trade in
services and income from assets held abroad have increased faster than
merchandise trade, according to estimates published by British Invisibles
yesterday, writes Peter Norman in London.
British Invisibles, which promotes the export of UK-based financial
institutions and professional and business services, said it estimated that
commercial invisibles, consisting of trade in services and income from
assets abroad, accounted for 34.4 per cent of world trade last year while
non-commercial transfers made up a further 6.2 per cent of the total.
Reviewing recent trends, British Invisibles said that world invisible trade
had increased by 153 per cent in dollar terms since 1984, compared with a 97
per cent increase in visible trade in the same period. Commercial invisible
transactions accounted for 30.4 per cent of world trade in 1984 while
non-commercial transfers were 4.1 per cent of total trade. Britain generated
a Dollars 15.1bn (Pounds 10bn) surplus from commercial invisible
transactions in 1992. This, according to British Invisibles, was the world's
third largest after the US and Switzerland, and more than double the UK's
Dollars 7bn commercial invisible surplus in 1991.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The presidents of Colombia, Venezuela and Mexico - the Group of Three (G3) -
yesterday signed an agreement to phase in a free trade pact over 10 years
and create a common market of 140m people.
The pact, which comes into effect on January 1 1995, was thrashed out
between negotiators over the past three years and was signed on the eve of
the meeting of Ibero-American heads of state in Cartagena. Colombia's trade
minister, Mr Juan Manuel Santos, called the trade pact 'the most important
trade accord in Colombian history'.
Most agricultural products and the vehicle industry will have special
treatment.
The car sector, in which small Colombian and Venezuelan producers fear
competition from much larger Mexican competitors, is to be included over a
13-year period and Venezuela will also be given a two-year grace period
before it is compelled to dismantle textiles tariffs.
Colombia's industrialists have raised serious objections to the agreement
and recently asked the government not to sign it, saying that it favours
Mexico too strongly.
Although Congress still has to ratify the treaty, both presidential
candidates in Sunday's election have given it their support. The G3 partners
agreed to seek further free trade pacts with Central American and Caribbean
states and to build on the pact as a cornerstone of Latin American
integration. Ecuador has already shown interest in joining the G3.
Colombia and Venezuela also hope that the new agreement will be a step
towards joining the North American Free Trade Agreement, which Mexico
entered on January 1.
Meanwhile, trade between Colombia and Venezuela, which soared during the
last two years, has again fallen in recent weeks as a result of a sharp
devaluation in the Venezuelan currency.

FT  15 JUN 94 / Japan would back sanctions on North Korea: Tokyo prime
minister reassures Clinton about taking 'responsible action'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Japan yesterday reassured the US that it would support possible United
Nations sanctions against North Korea over Pyongyang's refusal to allow
international inspection of its nuclear facilities.
Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata told President Bill Clinton Japan would 'take
responsible action within the bounds of our constitution' if the UN adopted
a sanctions resolution.
In a 20-minute phone conversation with Mr Clinton, he denied the minority
Japanese government was reluctant to take UN-backed sanctions. The Social
Democratic party, the second largest opposition group, opposes sanctions, a
reflection of its left wing's ideological support for Pyongyang and the cash
it gets from North Korean groups in Japan.
Japan's gesture of solidarity came after Ms Madeleine Albright, US
ambassador to the UN, said it would submit a draft sanctions resolution to
the Security Council in the next few days, in response to North Korea's
announcement on Monday that it would withdraw from the International Atomic
Energy Agency.
Official notice of the withdrawal was made yesterday by North Korea's
ambassador to the UN. Ms Kathleen deLaski , US Defence Department
spokeswoman, said the planned withdrawal 'really does make a serious
situation even more so'.
The heightened tensions unsettled share prices in Tokyo and Seoul. The
Nikkei average of 225 leading Japanese stocks fell 198.84 points, or 0.9 per
cent, to close at 21,353.97 although in early trading today the average was
up by over 100 points.
The South Korean composite index shed 19.52, or 2.1 per cent, to 903.72
yesterday. It was the sharpest one-day fall on the Seoul bourse since the
nuclear dispute entered a critical phase at the end of May with Pyongyang's
unsupervised removal of spent fuel rods from its nuclear reactor.
Mr Han Sung-joo, South Korea's foreign minister, yesterday expressed
confidence that no conflict would erupt soon on the Korean peninsula.
'Despite war talk, there is no reason to worry about the outbreak of
hostilities,' he said. The door to negotiations with North Korea remained
open, although 'the possibility seems much less than several weeks ago'.
South Korea's President Kim Young-sam said North Korea's announced
withdrawal from the IAEA was not surprising and was 'taken to avoid the
disgrace of (Pyongyang) being kicked out of' the IAEA.
Some government officials in Seoul believe Pyongyang may be using the
threatened pull-out as a new negotiating tactic to force the US to hold a
fresh round of direct talks on possible diplomatic normalisation and
economic aid. North Korea has insisted direct negotiations with the US would
solve the nuclear dispute.
Pyongyang used a similar threat of withdrawal from the nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty in March 1993 to gain two rounds of inconclusive
talks with the US last summer. Former US President Jimmy Carter will travel
from Seoul to Pyongyang today, in an unofficial attempt to maintain
diplomatic dialogue.
Mr Han indicated it would take several weeks to pass a UN sanctions
resolution against North Korea as the western powers try to persuade China
to support punitive actions.
'Obviously, we do not know what the Chinese attitude will be in the next few
weeks and their response will depend on what North Korea does,' said Mr Han,
suggesting China would support sanctions if Pyongyang remains intransigent.
Beijing made no official comment yesterday. North Korea has warned it would
regard UN sanctions as a declaration of war, but Mr Han dismissed the
threat. 'That's just scare tactics. We can't base our response on the
irresponsible threats an irresponsible country is making.'
The Japanese government has been making practical preparations for sanctions
over the past few months and running simulations of the likely outcomes,
ranging from a trade war to a real war. Initially, the Japanese media
responded calmly, but this has developed into alarm over the past week in
response to the growing momentum by the US, Japan and South Korea for phased
sanctions.
Japan's military presumes North Korea has the 'basic capacity' to make
nuclear weapons, Mr Atsushi Kanda, director-general of the Defence Agency -
Tokyo's equivalent of a defence minister - told a parliamentary committee
yesterday. Existing defences would deal with a North Korean air strike, but
find it 'difficult' to stop a missile such as the Rodong, an upgraded
1,000km-range Scud under development by Pyongyang.

FT  15 JUN 94 / China harbours doubts on HK land measures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China has expressed doubt over the measures announced last week to cool Hong
Kong's overheated property market.
Mr Lu Ping, Beijing's top official on Hong Kong affairs, told a delegation
of Hong Kong businessmen visiting Beijing that China is concerned that the
greater effect of the measures will take place after 1997, when Hong Kong
reverts to China, rather than before.
Last week, the Hong Kong government announced measures, including a proposed
increase in the supply of land and a reduction in the pre-sale of flats.
Analysts and leading house-builders such as Mr Li Ka-shing said they thought
the measures would help restrain the growth in house prices.
The increase in land supply (70 hectares more than planned) was seen as
having the biggest effect in the medium term, and analysts expect it to have
a downwards effect on prices. It is, however, the one major measure which
also needs China's assent as Beijing has a role in the allocation of land in
Hong Kong.
Mr Lu was quoted as saying Beijing did not want to see big fluctuations in
land and property prices after 1997. 'We hope to see stability. The
overheated property market definitely has to be cooled, but it has to be
cooled gradually,' he said.
His comments may reflect concern in Beijing about the possibility of
presiding over a slump in house prices just as China resumes sovereignty. In
voicing them, Mr Lu kept China's options open. He said the issue ought to be
discussed in the Sino-British land commission, the body which will have to
approve an increased allocation in land.
House prices have fallen significantly since the government said in March it
would intervene in the market. Investors believed last week's measures would
depress prices further and accordingly marked down property shares.

Indonesian police have detained two leading labour activists and summoned a
third in an apparent crackdown linked to riots which swept Medan city in
April, Reuter reports from Jakarta.
Diplomats said the moves, which included interrogating Mr Muchtar Pakpahan,
a labour leader, may be part of a wider effort to discredit Indonesia's
nascent labour movement by linking it with growing unrest directed at the
ethnic Chinese minority.
Labour rallies in Medan in April were the climax of growing worker unrest in
economically vibrant Indonesia.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Philippines' current account deficit reached Dollars 676m (Pounds 450m)
in the first quarter, more than double the year-ago figure of Dollars 297m.
According to data released yesterday by the country's central bank, however,
a sharply higher net inflow in the non-monetary capital account of Dollars
1.16bn, up from Dollars 849m last year, more than compensated.
A bigger trade deficit, up 30 per cent to Dollars 1.66bn, resulted mainly
from increased imports of capital goods and raw materials, which the central
bank said 'reflected the bullish investment climate' during the period.
Helping ease the pressure were the accelerated growth in exports (up 17.8
per cent to Dollars 2.9bn) and substantial gains in short-term capital and
foreign investments (up 36 per cent to Dollars 1.16bn), boosted by proceeds
from the partial privatisation of Petron, the state-controlled oil refining
and marketing company.
Net foreign investments, bolstered by the Dollars 502m payment for 40 per
cent holdings in Petron that Saudi Arabia's Aramco group won in a bidding,
grew 114 per cent to Dollars 548m.

FT  15 JUN 94 / Keidanren urges more deregulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Keidanren, Japan's most powerful business federation, yesterday stepped
up its campaign for more economic deregulation, amid the latest signs of a
corporate recovery.
Mr Shoichiro Toyoda, who became Keidanren's chairman at the start of this
month, called on Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata to halve the number of business
regulations in the next five years. He urged the government to 'break the
wall of vested interests'.
There were 11,402 regulatory permits and approvals in force in March 1993,
460 more than the previous year, and the seventh year running of growth in
the red tape mountain, according to the government's Management and
Co-ordination Agency. They cover industries representing 40 per cent of
gross national product, estimates the Tokyo office of Baring Securities.
Highly publicised deregulation drives by successive administrations have
failed because of ministries' reluctance to lose power, and fear of
competition, mainly among small companies in highly regulated sectors such
as distribution. By contrast, big manufacturing business, represented by the
Keidanren, supports deregulation to cut costs and in the hope that a more
open market might bring a fall in the value of the yen, strength of which is
hampering exports.
Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the previous prime minister, staged a fresh
deregulation drive on taking office last August, but only held power for
eight months, not enough to make significant progress on his hit list of 94
regulations.
Mr Hata, whose government may be even shorter lived, yesterday called on
cabinet ministers to display 'leadership' in pulling together by the end of
this month a package of proposals to cut red tape.
Fresh evidence that the worst of the recession is over for large companies
came yesterday with a 33 per cent year-on-year decline by value in
bankruptcies last month, reported by Teikoku Databank. However, the number
of corporate collapses rose by 7.3 per cent over the same period, suggesting
that small companies continue to suffer.
Many businesses are still faced with surplus capacity, shown by a 2.5 per
cent decline in private sector machinery orders in April, from the same
month last year, the government's Economic Planning Agency reported
yesterday.
Cost cutting rather than sales growth will be the main feature of corporate
Japan's expected profits recovery this year, according to a survey of the
recent annual results of 1,198 quoted companies by the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
They told the TSE they expected quoted pre-tax profits to rise by a combined
6.44 per cent this year on nearly stagnant sales, up by just 0.25 per cent.

FT  15 JUN 94 / Israel denies continuing use of torture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Israeli Defence Force command last night 'unequivocally denied' a human
rights organisation's allegations that security forces are continuing
systematically to torture and abuse Palestinian detainees.
In a 316-page report the well-respected New York-based Human Rights Watch,
claims security forces are still using beatings, physical force, abusive
body positioning, sensory deprivation and psychological pressure to obtain
confessions.
'Any means of torture or violence against detainees is forbidden under
Israeli law and any confession extracted against the free will of the
detainee is inadmissible as evidence,' the IDF said.
The report, released today, alleges the abuses have continued despite last
September's Israeli-Palestinian peace accord. Of the 36 cases it has
documented, 10 are said to have occurred since the peace agreement.
'The abuses are not isolated excesses but constitute a pattern that could
persist only with the acquiescence of the government of Israel,' it says.
Mr Uri Dromi, the government spokesman, said: 'Basically, we welcome this
report because we think no country or organisation is above criticism. We
always use these reports to check ourselves and see where if at all we were
wrong, and how to improve our-selves and refrain from exceeding what the law
allows.'
Human Rights Watch claims Israeli interrogators use a 'systemised,
co-ordinated and increasingly painful regime of physical constraints and
psychological pressures' over days and weeks, 'in a manner calculated to
inflict extreme pain and mental anguish without leaving lasting physical
traces'.
Human Rights Watch accuses Israeli doctors and medics of complicity in
torture and ill-treatment of Palestinians during interrogation by security
officers and soldiers.
The report carries an interview with an Israeli sergeant who says he beat a
blindfolded Palestinian suspect with a club.
The sergeant claims he broke many bones and that other interrogators would
sometimes pour a liquid like acid on suspects' wounds.
Of the 36 ex-detainees interviewed, 42 per cent alleged they were beaten on
the testicles; 94 per cent said they had been deprived of sleep for up to
several days; 29 per cent said they had been deliberately placed in

Israel admits certain practices, including hooding suspects with canvas
bags, confining them to small chairs and using moderate physical pressure.
But it says all these physical methods are highly regulated and do not add
up to torture and ill-treatment.

FT  15 JUN 94 / Significant chapter ends, but more follow: Andrew Jack on
BCCI convictions in probably the largest bank fraud
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In September 1991 more than 30 senior employees of the Bank of Credit and
Commerce International in Abu Dhabi were summoned to what they were told was
a 'management meeting'.
To their surprise, on the agenda was their detention on the grounds of
alleged involvement in the frauds at BCCI that had led two months previously
to the closure of the bank by regulators around the world.
The announcement yesterday of the conviction of 12 of them marks the
conclusion of a significant chapter in efforts by prosecutors around the
world to bring to justice a large number of the perpetrators of probably the
largest banking fraud ever.
It leaves the question of punishment for the most senior executives of BCCI,
and does little for hundreds of thousands of depositors, employees and
creditors seeking compensation.
Of those rounded up in Abu Dhabi nearly three years ago, several were
released quickly and others followed after an initial report by the public
prosecutor. That left 14 who were formally charged in July last year.
Arguably the most significant of the accused, Mr Agha Hasan Abedi, the
founder and president of BCCI, who was sentenced to eight years, was tried
in his absence. He has lived in ailing health in Pakistan for several years.
All efforts to extradite him have proved fruitless - by Abu Dhabi and by the
US authorities, where he was indicted last July for fraud, bribery,
conspiracy, larceny and racketeering.
Mr Abedi's assistant, Mr Swaleh Naqvi, who was BCCI's chief executive and
wrote a series of confessions to Abu Dhabi implicating himself and Mr Abedi
in 1990, was sentenced to 14 years.
Mr Naqvi was sent under an agreement with the Abu Dhabi authorities to the
US in May, where he is due to stand trial on three sets of federal charges
and one set brought in New York state.
Under the agreement, the US authorities may agree to return him to Abu Dhabi
once he has served out any criminal sentences in the US. But they also
reserve the right to hand him over to other governments first.
A third BCCI executive convicted for three years yesterday was Mr Ziauddin
Ali Akbar, former head of the bank's treasury, who was last September
sentenced to six years imprisonment in the UK after pleading guilty to 16
charges of false accounting involving more than Dollars 745m.
Of the remaining 11, Mr Arjmand Naqvi has since died. Mr Iqbal Rizvi, who
had been released on bail, was acquitted yesterday on charges of assisting
other executives in the forgery and concealment of loans.
The remaining nine have been held in detention at the Police Officers' Club
in Abu Dhabi since their arrest, and taken periodically to court appearances
since last October, when their trial began.
Three were sentenced yesterday to six years each: Mr Zafar Iqbal, head of
BCCI's Emirates branch, Mr Hassan Kazmi, primarily responsible for managing
money stolen from the Abu Dhabi royal family, and Mr Abdul Hafeez, company
secretary.
The rest received three years each: Mr Fakhir Hussain, an account officer in
Abu Dhabi, Mr Mohammed Azmatullah, who was one of Mr Naqvi's top assistants
in London, Mr Ameer Siddiqi and Mr Imtiaz Ahmad, who both sat on BCCI's loan
authorisation committee, Mr Naseem Sheikh, who worked in the treasury
department, and Mr Bashir Tahir.
All of those found guilty are also required in the judgment to meet civil
claims brought against them by the Abu Dhabi for Dollars 9bn in compensation
for money allegedly stolen from the royal family and government bodies.
A number of details remain to be answered over the sentencing, including how
much more time they will spend in prison if unable to pay off the Dollars
9bn claim and whether they or the prosecution will appeal their sentences in
the next two weeks.
In August last year a US jury acquitted Mr Robert Altman, a Washington
lawyer accused of profiting from loans given by BCCI to enable him to buy
shares in First American, the bank of which he was president. After the
collapse of this and other cases, the authorities are keen to see Mr Naqvi
prosecuted.
In the UK, two others connected with BCCI have been prosecuted. Last month
Mr Nazmudin Virani, the former head of Control Securities, was jailed for 2
1/2 years for fraud relating to his business dealings with BCCI.
Mr Mohammed Baqi, the former managing director of Attock Oil, was convicted
in February of conspiring fraudulently to inflate BCCI's profits and fined
Pounds 120,000 plus costs.
The trial is continuing of Mr Imran Imam, a former BCCI official who denies
six charges including conspiring to conceal documents, falsify records and
furnish false information.

<TEXT>
Iran has decided to let privately-owned banks open from next week for the
first time since the Islamic revolution in 1979, Reuter reports from
Nicosia.
Mr Mohammed Hussein Adeli, central bank governor, was quoted by Tehran radio
as saying the bank would supervise the private banks 'and therefore
guarantee their activities'. Mr Adeli said regulations for private banks had
been approved by the government and a Money and Credit Council and declared
to be within constitutional and religious laws.
'The banks would be able to take deposits and participate in production and
economic activities nationwide,' he said.
Iran nationalised private banks at the start of the revolution. There are
five existing state-owned banks. Foreign banks have representative offices
in Tehran. Initial capital of a private bank should be at least 5bn rials
(Pounds 1.9m). No bank would be allowed to lend more than 15 times its
deposited capital, Mr Adeli said.

FT  15 JUN 94 / Killings raise fears of Kurdish violence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ANKARA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The killing of at least 12 people during a funeral procession in northern
Iraq has raised fears of new violence between rival Kurdish groups,
threatening a 10-day-old ceasefire, disrupting vital aid efforts, and
raising doubts about the durability of the self-administered Kurdish region.
Monday's incident in Suleimaniya near the Iranian border occurred as rival
leaders - Mr Massoud Barzani of the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) and Mr
Jalal Talabani of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) - were meeting
under Turkish auspices to review the tentative ceasefire to end a month of
clashes leading to 300 deaths.
The killings, at a funeral of a KDP militiaman, could hardly be worse-timed
for the nascent Kurdish leadership, striving to preserve its power-sharing
experiment. The violence comes as Turkey's parliament is due to debate the
mandate for Operation Provide Comfort, the Turkish-based allied air
operation set up to protect the Kurds. The clash coincides with renewed UN
efforts to win donor-support for relief efforts in Iraq.
The Kurdish zone is a legacy of the safe havens set up by the allies in 1991
to repatriate some 500,000 civilians who had fled to Turkey and Iran in the
wake of Saddam Hussein's onslaught. Since May, the UN estimates 25,000
people have been displaced by the fighting between rival militia. The haven
is now in effect partitioned, with the KDP dominating the northern area
along the Turkish border; the PUK controls the southern area centred on
Suleimaniya. Aid workers have warned the Kurdish leadership they may have to
curtail the operation unless security improves. The Germans have suspended
aid operations.
Earlier, Mr Mohammed Zejjari, UN co-ordinator for Iraq, said he planned to
call a meeting to win new aid pledges under the Dollars 280m (Pounds 186m)
requested in this year's programme. Only a few million dollars have been
provided.

Hungary's central bank yesterday admitted that its latest interest rate
increase could hold back economic recovery. Mr Almos Kovacs, deputy
president of the National Bank of Hungary, forecast that GDP would grow by
just 1 per cent in 1994. The central bank's internal projection had been for
output to bounce back by 2-3 per cent this year after falling by 21 per cent
between 1989 and 1993. Hungary, burdened by a gross foreign debt of Dollars
25.5bn, has been slower than Poland and the Czech Republic to emerge from
the east Europe-wide recession. The NBH revised its economic outlook in the
light of its decision last week to increase the base rate by three points to
25 per cent and raise 'repo' rates by two points. The monetary authorities
acted to reduce a current account deficit which last year exceeded 10 per
cent of GDP. The central bank called yesterday on the incoming Socialist-led
government to play its part by cutting government spending. Mr Laszlo
Bekesi, the likely finance minister in the new adminstration, has committed
himself to introducing a restrictive mini-budget later this summer.

<TEXT>
Germany's Federation of Trade Unions (DGB), under which the country's 16
unions are grouped, at its congress yesterday elected Mr Dieter Schulte as
its new chairman in a move likely to usher in gradual reforms throughout the
labour movement. Although Mr Schulte, 54, comes from the ranks of IG Metall,
Germany's powerful engineering union, and the largest in the DGB, he is not
expected to push the unions towards open confrontation with the government
over its policies on unemployment.
Mr Schulte, considered a pragmatist, will have to decide how the DGB's 11m
members reconcile themselves with the slow shift away from centralised wage
bargaining to more power being devolved to the works councils in separate
enterprises. Of growing concern for the congress, which ends on Friday, is
how it might respond to the consistent decline in union membership.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
German retail sales fell a real 6 per cent during April, and were down 10
per cent on the comparable month last year, the federal statistics office
said yesterday. Although the figures were distorted because the Easter
shopping rush fell in March this year, economists said the decline confirmed
expectations that shrinking real incomes were stifling private sector
demand. The fall, widely forecast, followed an unexpectedly strong first
quarter. The cumulative total shows real sales in the first four months were
a real 2 per cent lower than in 1993. James Capel's London office calculated
that combining March and April data, and thus discounting the effect of the
early Easter holiday, sales for the two months were 4 per cent lower
year-on-year. According to the statistics office only drugs, cosmetics and
paper and printed goods have managed year-on-year increases in the first
four months. Clothing sales were down 4 per cent and turnover from road
vehicles fell 3 per cent. Mail order deliveries were unchanged in the
period, but other leading outlets showed sales declines of between 3 and 5
per cent.

Greece yesterday left a closed hearing at the European Court of Justice
believing it had successfully defended its trade blockade of the former
Yugoslav republic of Macedonia. Foreign ministry official Jannos
Kranidiotis, who headed a team of five Greek lawyers trying to stop an
emergency court ruling forcing Athens to lift the embargo, said the European
Commission 'did not bring any new elements' to the three-hour hearing. The
EU executive had 'failed to prove irreparable damage' was being done to the
European Union as a result of the sanctions on Skopje, Mr Kranidiotis said.
The Commission has to show irreparable damage if it is to get a ruling
against the embargo. Greece banned trade with Macedonia and the use of its
Thessaloniki port to pressure it into changing its flag and constitution,
which Athens says implies territorial ambitions on Greece's own region of
the same name. Mr Hans van den Broek, EU External Political Relations
Commissioner, said it was now up to the court to decide. It is not expected
to rule for two weeks.

<TEXT>
Mr Silvio Berlusconi, Italy's prime minister, yesterday held a special
meeting of economic ministers to discuss the impact of the constitutional
court decision ordering payment of arrears on minimum pensions. The cost of
making the payments in line with the court's decision was estimated to be
L30,000bn (Pounds 12.36bn) by Mr Clemente Mastella, the labour minister. Mr
Lamberto Dini, the treasury minister, said before the meeting he had no
details of how the estimated L30,000bn cost had been reached, but admitted
the pensions issue was a 'major problem'.
Mr Gino Giugni, a former labour minister, said yesterday the Berlusconi
government had no alternative but to make the payments. However, he voiced
surprise at the estimated cost. The previous Ciampi government, he said, had
been aware of the impending court decision and had considered L16,000bn the
upper limit. Both the stock market and the government bond market reflected
continued nervousness because of the uncertain effect of funding the court
decision on the public sector deficit. Robert Graham, Rome

FT  15 JUN 94 / Economic Watch: Inflation on the rise in Greece
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Greece's annual inflation rate rose to 11 per cent in May from 10.4 per cent
the previous month, according to official figures released yesterday.
Monthly consumer prices went up by 0.8 per cent in May. As in April, the
increase resulted from a new tax on heating fuel and higher food prices.
Increases in household rents and clothing prices also contributed. The
government's target of bringing the inflation rate down to 9.5 per cent by
the end of the year now looks difficult to achieve. Although a devaluation
was averted following last month's lifting of capital controls, the drachma
is expected to depreciate against other EU currencies. Analysts said higher
prices for imported goods over the next few months as a consequence of the
drachma's recent depreciation, together with increased transport and utility
prices, could add another one or two percentage points to the year-end rate.
Kerin Hope, Athens
Spain's consumer price index rose 0.2 per cent in May, keeping the annual
inflation rate unchanged from April at 4.9 per cent, according to the
economy ministry. The number of registered unemployed dropped for the third
month running, by 57,000 to 2.68m or 17.4 per cent. David White, Madrid
Portugal's consumer price index, excluding rents, rose 0.2 per cent in May,
compared with an increase of 0.6 per cent in April, the national statistics
institute said yesterday. Average annual inflation was 6 per cent, unchanged
from April, but down from 8.2 per cent in May 1993. Year-on-year inflation
fell from 6 per cent in April to 5.7 per cent in May. Peter Wise, Portugal
The Nederlandsche Bank, the Dutch central bank, lowered its key money market
intervention rate yesterday to 4.9 per cent from 5 per cent, as it offered
Dutch banks five-day funding under the so-called special advance facility.

<TEXT>
Greece's transport minister, Mr Yannis Haralambous, faces a grilling today
from the European Commission over the government's request to write off
Dr491bn (Pounds 1.3bn) of debt incurred by Olympic Airways, the loss-making
state carrier.
Brussels is demanding considerable changes in return for its acceptance of
the debt write-off and a Dr53bn capital injection over the next three years.
Olympic would have to end its monopoly of ground handling facilities. It
would also have to open up to other carriers profitable domestic routes to
the Greek islands from next year rather than in 1998, the present date for
deregulation of island routes.
The government would no longer be allowed to set ticket prices or interfere
in management. No further state aid would be permitted and the airline's
loans could not be guaranteed by the state.
The country's civil aviation authorities would have to speed up the issuing
of operating licences to private Greek airlines, and let to compete head-on
with Olympic on scheduled services. The three new airlines licensed to
operate since deregulation was launched in 1993 are all registered as
charter carriers, although they operate regular flights to Greek and
European destinations.
The Commission's proposals, outlined in a letter to the Greek government, go
well beyond the measures foreseen in Olympic's restructuring plan, which as
submitted in Brussels last month.
Mr Haralambous is expected to argue that maintaining control of the ground
handling operation, which brings in Dr30bn a year or 15 per cent of
Olympic's operating income, is crucial to returning the airline to profit by
1997, as envisaged by the plan. However, other airlines complain that
restrictive working practices and bureaucratic delays mean ground handling
at Greek airports is more expensive and less efficient than elsewhere in the
EU.
Under the restructuring plan, Olympic has already agreed to freeze salaries
for the next two years, cut loss-making long-haul routes, and eliminate
1,500 jobs through an early retirement programme. The airline projects
operating losses of Dr24bn in 1994, with accumulated debt rising to Dr550bn.

Mounting European Union fears about the safety of the Chernobyl nuclear
plant in the former Soviet republic of Ukraine overshadowed yesterday's
signing of a partnership and co-operation agreement aimed at reaching a
common free trade zone by around the end of the century.
A similar accord with Russia is due to be initialled next week in Corfu at
the summit of EU leaders. According to Mr Theodoros Pangalos, European
affairs minister of Greece, current EU president, President Boris Yeltsin
has confirmed he will attend the meeting.
Ukraine's President Leonid Kravchuk, in Luxembourg yesterday for the
signing, said he regarded the partnership agreement as a first step towards
eventual Ukrainian membership of the EU. He did not raise the question of
nuclear security, EU diplomats said. This is despite a letter to the Greek
presidency from Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany and President Francois
Mitterrand of France, calling for action on Chernobyl to be 'at the heart of
our forthcoming summit'.
Germany and France, with wide backing among their partners, want the summit
to agree on a support framework for the overhaul of Ukraine's energy sector,
to make possible an early shutdown of the Chernobyl nuclear reactors.
Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president, told Mr Kravchuk that
fears about Chernobyl had pushed it near the top of the EU agenda. 'I think
I can speak for all of us,' he said, 'that the only solution is the complete
and rapid closure of this nuclear facility.'
Ukraine is stalling over closure while it seeks alternative energy sources
and a large payment from the west.
The nuclear power station is plagued with problems. Experts are currently
searching for the source of a seven-day leak of radioactive water from a
cooling pond where spent fuel rods are stored at reactor number 2. An
official from Ukraine's nuclear supervisory body, Mr Boris Yukhimenko,
claimed that 'nothing alarming has occurred' pointing out that radiation
levels are normal and that the reactor has been closed since a 1991 fire.
Meanwhile, two tons of contaminated water are leaking daily.
The Franco-German initiative aims at providing new EU funds for the nearly
exhausted Nuclear Safety Account, which is managed by the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development.
It also wants the World Bank to play a central role in co-ordinating efforts
to develop safer and alternative energy sources in Ukraine.
Senior German, British and French officials make clear that no figures for
EU aid will be decided at Corfu, because the Union wants the US and Japan to
pledge significant finance for the scheme at next month's Group of Seven
summit in Naples. 'We are after the maximum multiplying effect,' said one
ambassador.
Ukraine in recent months has talked of energy restructuring needs running to
around Ecu10bn (Pounds 7.7bn). But officials say this is a long-term
projection, whereas the Franco-German letter indicates that what is needed
now are funds sufficient to close Chernobyl and bring the reactors at
Zaporodje, Khrnelnitski and Rovno up to western European safety standards.
Mr Delors underlined to Mr Kravchuk that it was also an urgent priority for
the EU that Ukraine should sign the non-proliferation treaty. Until this was
done, warned Mr Willy Claes, Belgian foreign minister, several member states
would be unable to ratify yesterday's agreement.
Despite the new closeness in the EU's relationship with the east the
partnership deal is meant to cement, Belgium was the only member state to
field a foreign minister at yesterday's signing.

Mr Achille Occhetto's successor as head of the former communist Party of the
Democratic Left (PDS) will be chosen by the party's 480-strong national
council, it was announced yesterday. Mr Occhetto resigned in the wake of the
European elections in which the PDS fared badly.
Mr Occhetto had been under pressure to step down since the March general
election, but the timing of his move - and the bitterness of his resignation
note - caught many of his colleagues by surprise. The tone of yesterday's
articles in L'Unita, the PDS newspaper, was respectful but far from
eulogistic.
The PDS, formed in 1991 and the largest opposition party, has procedures, as
yet untested, for electing the leadership in circumstances such as these.
The resignation of the communist party leader for personal or political
reasons is unprecedented. The former communist party's tradition is embedded
in the PDS psychologywhere the secretary-general's departure is only
envisaged for 'objective reasons'.
The contest to replace Mr Occhetto is expected to be both unpredictable and
hard-fought.
Most unpredictable element will be the role of the national council, which,
for the first time, will have to conduct a democratic leadership contest.
Mr Stefano Rodota, one of the father figures in the PDS, was quoted
yesterday as saying it was not simply a question of replacing Mr Occhetto,
but the entire top tier of the party. The implication was that they were all
identified with the past of excessive control at the centre of the communist
party.
Under Mr Occhetto the PDS was steered towards a social democrat philosophy,
similar to the Social Democratic party in Germany. But he failed to broaden
its appeal beyond the old communist voters and lost a sizeable rump to
hardline marxists who formed Reconstructed Communism.
According to Mr Massimo Cacciari, PDS mayor of Venice and a possible
contender for the leadership, Mr Occhetto's successor must be able to unite
the left as a coherent attractive electoral force. Six groupings, from
Greens to Socialists, formed the PDS-led Progressive Alliance in the
election; in the new first-past-the-post voting system they stand little
chance individually.
The weakness of the small left-wing parties was underlined yesterday by the
resignation of Mr Ottaviano Del Turco from the leadership of the once
powerful, but now insignificant, Socialist party, and by the resignation of
Mr Willer Bordon as co-ordinator of the Democratic Alliance.
Only a year ago the Democratic Alliance seemed ready to act as an umbrella
under which the parties could regroup on the left. Involving former
Communists, Republicans and Christian Democrats, it failed to get off the
ground because the PDS was not prepared to co-operate. Continuing
differences suggest the left will take a long time to reorganise itself to
challenge the right-wing coalition of Mr Silvio Berlusconi.

FT  15 JUN 94 / Irish political 'mould breakers' face the prospect of
break-up: FT correspondents report on fallout from last weekend's European
election
</HEADLINE>

The party which set out nine years ago 'to break the mould' of Irish
politics, the Progressive Democrats (PDs), looks to be on the verge of
breaking apart itself as a result of internal feuding following its
humiliation in the European elections, and the first poll defeat ever for
the party's founder and former leader, Mr Des O'Malley.
Mr Mary Harney, the present leader, called the defeat as a 'catastrophe'.
She has been criticised by some colleagues for her handling of the campaign,
although senior party figures were yesterday ruling out a leadership
challenge.
Mr O'Malley had been chosen by the party to defend its only seat in
Strasbourg. That had been won in 1989 by Mr Pat Cox, the party's deputy
leader, who had achieved the distinction of gaining more votes than any
other candidate in Ireland in that election.
The 55-year-old Mr O'Malley resigned the leadership of the party eight
months ago 'to make way for new blood' and said at the time he had made 'an
absolute decision' not to run in the European elections.
Ms Harney was subsequently elected party leader, defeating a challenge from
Mr Cox. Then, earlier this year, she asked Mr O'Malley to reconsider his
decision and to take over Mr Cox's seat. This he duly did, precipitating Mr
Cox's resignation from the party last month and his decision to run as an
independent candidate. The two were neck-and-neck as the successive vote
transfers were counted, and the final result, which gave the seat to Mr Cox,
was only announced late on Monday. Nationally, the party only polled 6.5 per
cent.
Ms Harney yesterday indicated that those party members who had supported Mr
Cox's campaign should now resign. This could widen the spilt in the party.
The PDs were formed in 1985 by Mr O'Malley and Ms Harney, after they were
expelled from Fianna Fail by its then leader, Mr Charles Haughey, for
opposing his hardline policy on Northern Ireland, the contraceptive issue
and internal party democracy.
It was Mr O'Malley's threat to pull out of the 1989-92 Fianna Fail-PD
coalition over a series of scandals that brought about Mr Haughey's downfall
in January 1992.
His subsequent public fight with Mr Albert Reynolds, who replaced Mr Haughey
as prime minister, over evidence they both gave to a public inquiry into the
country's huge beef industry, then brought about the collapse of the
coalition and precipitated the November 1992 general election.
The report of that inquiry is expected to be published shortly.
Ms Harney has been a formidable performer in parliament, frequently
overshadowing Mr John Bruton, leader of the main opposition Fine Gael party.
But the PDs' ambition to overtake Fine Gael as the main conservative voice
in Ireland has now been seriously damaged by their Euro-election debacle.

FT  15 JUN 94 / Bundesbank stands by M3 as guide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The German central bank will continue to rely on money supply as a key guide
to its monetary policy, but extra time may be needed to iron out recent
distortions, Mr Hans Tietmeyer, Bundesbank president, hinted last night.
The bank stood by the principle of its policy based on the M3 measure of
monetary growth, he said. This did not exclude consideration of the special
factors affecting M3, or fine-tuning including the 'time horizon'.
The issues would be discussed at the bank's mid-year M3 review next month,
he said at an international banking gathering in Frankfurt.
Mr Tietmeyer's comments suggest the bank is seeking to damp widespread
criticism that M3 has been discredited, that the bank's own credibility has
suffered as a result, and that the measure should be abandoned.
A recent study from Goldman Sachs, for example, attributed recent weakness
in bond markets partly to the Bundesbank's 'ambivalent' attitude towards M3
growth rates which this year have far exceeded its target range of 4-6 per
cent. In April, the measure was still growing at 15.4 per cent.
The bank had sharply reduced interest rates despite months of excessive
monetary growth, while at the same time continuing to stress the
inflationary dangers of growing liquidity.
The study said keeping the current target range unchanged until the end of
1995 was 'the only theoretically clean and credible solution' to the bank's
dilemma. The government's council of economic experts, the so-called 'five
wise men' has often suggested that the current practice of setting targets
for one year at a time should be dropped.
Extension of the 1994 target's time-scale would allow more time for the
absorption into long-term investments of excess liquidity currently
distorting the M3 data, and avoid the danger of a new 1995 target being
disrupted from the outset.
Although the 1995 M3 target is not due to be set until next December, the
central bank may now feel that markets need more reassurance than has been
available so far.
Until now, central bank officials have tended simply to insist that M3 must
stay. Mr Tietmeyer again stressed that money supply targeting remained a key
indicator in Bundesbank policy. Alternative strategies practised elsewhere
in countries which had given up targeting had yet to stand the test of time,
he added.
While admitting the bank could not calculate the precise effects of the
special factors distorting M3 at present, it was by no means in a state
which others had experienced in the past where it could no longer make any
sense of money supply growth, he added.
He was concerned that recent disruptions - starting back in 1990 with German
unification - seemed to have affected M3's capacity as an effective
indicator. But internal and external research had yet to suggest that the
long-term relationship between money supply and inflation had been altered.
Monetary targeting constituted a part of Germany's stability culture which
would not be easy to give up, he said.

FT  15 JUN 94 / Presidential ambitions fanned on French right: FT

Squabbling broke out yesterday within France's governing RPR-UDF coalition
over the likely candidate for next year's presidential election.
A group of 27 deputies threatened to break away from the parliamentary group
of their centre-right UDF federation, in an evident move to back Mr Edouard
Balladur, the RPR Gaullist premier, for the presidency next year.
Last night, the 27 were persuaded by the leadership of their Republican
Party to suspend their planned breakaway pending a party conference on June
26.
The rekindling of presidential rivalries within the conservative UDF-RPR
coalition follows the poor showing by Mr Michel Rocard, leader of the
Socialist party, in the European elections. Mr Rocard gained only 14.5 per
cent of the vote for his Euro-Socialist list and now looks easy to beat next
year. This has encouraged several candidates on the right to enter the field
against him.
Earlier yesterday, the 27 deputies pledged themselves to support a single
candidate representing the RPR and UDF, while Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing,
overall leader of the UDF federation, has said he wants the UDF to field its
own man, perhaps himself.
The other factor behind yesterday's move was the Euro-election success of Mr
Philippe de Villiers, whose anti-Maastricht campaign split his Republican
party. Most of the rebels are similarly Eurosceptic, unable to stomach the
notion of backing an old pro-European like Mr Giscard d'Estaing next year.
The fact that Mr Balladur is drawing UDF support of this nature may incline
him to a more nationalistic stance towards Europe.
For his part, Mr Balladur is maintaining a public show of having nothing to
do with this internal politicking and of merely getting on with running the
country. Next week he lays out plans for reforming social security and the
budget and for following up his initiatives in Gatt and and in promoting
European stability over the next six months.
Meanwhile, two newly elected MEPs traded insults yesterday. Mr Bernard Tapie
dismissed as 'ridiculous inventions' claims by Mr Thierry Jean-Pierre, an
ex-magistrate who won a seat on the de Villiers list, that the Marseilles
politician/businessman may be using money in foreign bank accounts to buy
back, under others' names, the Olympique-Marseille football club he has been
ordered to sell.

FT  15 JUN 94 / US telecoms alliance for France and Germany: Dollars 4bn
stake in Sprint planned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Plans for an ambitious global telecommunications alliance between the French
and German state-owned operators and Sprint, a US company, were unveiled
yesterday, heralding a bitter regulatory battle in the US.
France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom intend to pay Dollars 4.2bn (Pounds
2.80bn) for a 20 per cent stake in Sprint, the third-largest long-distance
carrier in the US. The three will establish joint ventures targeted at the
communications needs of multinational companies.
AT&amp;T, the largest US operator, yesterday urged the US government to block
the alliance unless France and Germany agreed to open their markets to
competition before the 1998 deadline agreed by the European Union last year.
The European state operators would strongly resist such a move.
The link-up is the second multi-billion dollar international telecoms
venture to have been launched in the past year. It resembles the deal forged
by British Telecommunications and MCI, the second-largest US carrier. BT has
pledged Dollars 4.3bn for a 20 per cent stake in MCI, and a further Dollars
750m to establish a joint venture company.
The BT-MCI alliance will this week gain the final approval of the US
Department of Justice, after a year-long investigation.
However, the Franco-German alliance with Sprint is set for a more fraught
regulatory battle because of the relative size of the operators and the fact
that, unlike BT, France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom enjoy a monopoly over
most telecommunications services in their respective countries.
Mr Victor Pelson, chairman of AT&amp;T's global operations, said: 'The French
and German markets are two of the most closed markets in the world for
telecoms service and equipment. They should provide full access before this
deal is allowed.'
The French and German companies insist that the alliance will offer services
only in sectors already open to competition in their home markets, such as
calling cards, data networks and private corporate networks. Mr Helmut
Ricke, chairman of Deutsche Telekom, said: 'We are sure that we will receive
regulatory approval otherwise we would not have signed.'
However, last month the Federal Cartel Administration in Berlin reported
that Deutsche Telekom had channeled subsidies totalling DM1.9bn (Pounds
.76bn) into its data networks division since data services were opened to
competition in Germany in 1989. The company claims that the cross subsidies
have ended
The Sprint deal builds on an Ecu1bn (Pounds 769m) alliance between Deutsche
Telekom and France Telecom signed last December, which still has to be
approved by the European Commission.

FT  15 JUN 94 / BCCI chiefs jailed and told to pay Dollars 9bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Twelve senior executives of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce
International were yesterday sentenced in Abu Dhabi to serve a combined
total of 61 years in prison and ordered to pay Dollars 9bn (Pounds 6bn) for
their involvement in one of the biggest frauds in history.
The verdicts marked the end of the first trial to examine the role of the
most important figures involved in allegedly defrauding hundreds of
thousands of creditors, depositors and employees of more than Dollars 12bn
in the decade before BCCI was closed by regulators in July 1991.
Mr Swaleh Naqvi, BCCI's former chief executive who is on trial in the US,
received in his absence the heaviest sentence of 14 years.
Mr Agha Hasan Abedi, the founder and president of BCCI, who is ill in
Pakistan and is unlikely to be extradited, was sentenced in his absence to
eight years' imprisonment.
Others in detention in Abu Dhabi received sentences ranging from three to
six years, while one defendant who has been on bail was acquitted. Mr
Ziauddin Ali Akbar, former head of BCCI's treasury division, was given three
years, though he is serving six years in England on 16 counts of false
accounting involving more than Dollars 745m.
The court ordered those found guilty to pay back Dollars 6.56bn stolen from
the private department of Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan al-Nahyan, the ruler of
Abu Dhabi, Dollars 1.35bn from the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, Dollars
1.22bn from the Finance Department, and to pay costs.
Mr Vivien Ambrose, chief representative of the BCCI Staff Association, said:
'These sentences are very light. I think it's dreadful. The plight of the
staff and the depositors remains unsolved and is going to drag on for
years.'
Mr John Moscow, an assistant district attorney for New York County, which
has charged Mr Naqvi and Mr Abedi, said the sentences appeared to be
'relatively light' given the magnitude of the charges.
Lawyers for the defendants said yesterday that they were considering
appealing.
The sentencing follows charges brought against 14 BCCI executives by the Abu
Dhabi authorities in July last year, and a trial by the state's public
prosecutor which began in October.
The government of Abu Dhabi, BCCI's majority shareholder, said: 'It is a
landmark in the BCCI affair that these key individuals have been brought to
justice.' It said it would continue to help world authorities bring
'wrongdoers' to justice.
Among the other sentences handed out, three senior executives of the bank
currently in detention in Abu Dhabi were given six years each: Mr Zafar
Iqbal, Mr Hassan Kazmi and Mr Abdul Hafeez.
A further six staff in detention in Abu Dhabi received three years each: Mr
Fakhir Hussain, Mr Mohammed Azmatullah, Mr Ameer Siddiqi, Mr Imtiaz Ahmad,
Mr Naseem Sheikh and Mr Bashir Tahir. Mr Iqbal Rizvi, one of the 14
originally charged, was acquitted on all charges.
Mr Naqvi is due to appear again in the Federal courts in Washington, DC,
today as part of a series of charges against him.

FT  15 JUN 94 / 'Scandalous' state of Gulf war tanks attacked by defence MPs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
It was 'scandalous' that three-quarters of the British army's main battle
tanks in Germany were under repair when the Gulf war broke out, the House of
Commons Defence Committee said yesterday.
Britain should also think twice before buying foreign weapons because it
cannot trust other countries to provide support in times of crisis, the
committee said in a report on the lessons of the Gulf war.
The Ministry of Defence, which is preparing several big procurement
decisions and a plan to make deep cuts in spending on support services
promised to study the report carefully.
The committee commended UK industry for its emergency operation to upgrade
the battle-readiness of forces rushed to Saudi Arabia following Iraq's
August 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
But the crisis found the UK ill-prepared to face chemical and germ warfare
attacks, while more than 75 per cent of the army's Challenger tanks in
Germany were out of service.
'We are disturbed that the UK was not as ready to protect its forces against
chemical and biological attack as it might have been,' the report said. Some
deficiencies had been rectified when hostilities began in January 1991, but
in future the forces might not have so long to prepare.
The committee deplored the condition of the Challenger-1 tanks which were
rushed to Kuwait from Germany. It described the tank's turret as 'barely
adequate' and said: 'We consider it scandalous that the Challenger-1 tank
fleet was in such a poor state.'
A spokesman for Vickers, the tank's manufacturer, said the Challenger-1 did
perform well when properly maintained, and it would soon be superseded by
the superior Challenger-2.
The report warns against running down the UK defence sector and said
strategic factors should be taken into account in procurement. The
government will make announcements soon on plans to buy frigates,
minesweepers and transport aircraft.
The committee said: 'We believe it would be unwise to rely entirely on even
our closest allies to provide surge capacity as they have their own
priorities and may wish to supply their own national forces first.'
It said some support roles, including the overhaul of vehicles, could be
farmed out to private companies but the army must maintain some in-house
capacity. A British Aerospace spokesman said UK companies could do vital
work at the war front which would be harder if foreign systems were
procured.

FT  15 JUN 94 / London likely to bear brunt of today's rail strike
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY, ROBERT TAYLOR and CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London commuters prepared to bear the brunt of today's 24-hour rail strike
as it emerged last night that the government was understood to have blocked
a 5.7 per cent pay offer for the 4,600 signal staff at the centre of the
dispute.
Railtrack, which runs the network, is believed to have put forward the offer
in talks with the RMT union earlier this week.
But the company was later told by the Transport Department - backed by the
Treasury - that the government would block any pay increase unless it was
fully funded by productivity.
The prospect of an above-inflation pay offer is said to have horrified
ministers, and Railtrack was told to demonstrate that staff were still
working in the public sector and must abide by government pay policy.
Ministers decided to intervene after concluding that Railtrack's
'inexperienced' negotiators were likely to concede too much to the RMT in an
attempt to keep the trains running.
RMT leader Mr Jimmy Knapp last night accused Railtrack of 'reneging' on a
5.7 per cent pay offer. He had earlier suggested that the government may
have been behind Railtrack withdrawing the offer and replacing it with one
for 2.5 per cent.
'Railtrack have dealt a body blow to industrial relations and the integrity
of the company is in tatters,' he said.
Labour's transport spokesman, Mr Brian Wilson, accused the government of
'gross irresponsibility' in 'sabotaging' the prospect of a settlement to the
dispute.
However, Mr Chris Leah, Railtrack's chief negotiator, denied that the
company had offered 5.7 per cent. Railtrack added last night: 'This decision
was taken by the board alone. We are a commercial company and we have to
live with commercial realities.'
In the Commons, Mr John Major condemned the strike and said extra parking
would be made available in London. The Department of Transport said there
would be 10,000 more spaces at locations such as Hyde Park and Regents Park.
In spite of the strike, most of London's Underground system will be running.
Police and motoring organisations advised people to share cars or stagger
journeys.
The London Weather Centre has forecast another sunny day today which could
persuade people to stay away from work.
Only 15 underground stations will be affected out of a total of 273. London
Transport said there would be no Tube services on the northern stretch of
the Bakerloo Line from Queens Park to Harrow and Wealdstone or in south
London on the District Line between Turnham Green and Richmond and East
Putney and Wimbledon.
Out of London's two main airports, Gatwick is expected to be hit hardest, as
its main service into the capital is a Railtrack line to Victoria. It is
expecting 54,000 arrivals today, of which 24 per cent would normally travel
on the Gatwick Express.
Heathrow will be less affected as it is connected to London by underground.
Today's strike is the first serious challenge to the new railway system
which is being fashioned from the framework of British Rail.

FT  15 JUN 94 / Today's rail strike likely to hit London hardest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY, ROBERT TAYLOR and CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's rail network was facing a widespread 24-hour shutdown from
midnight last night as bitter exchanges erupted between the RMT union and
Railtrack, which runs the national network.
London, which normally has about 400,000 rail commuters each day, is likely
to face the worst disruption. Other cities such as Manchester, Birmingham
and Glasgow expect minimal extra congestion on roads.
Mr Jimmy Knapp, the RMT leader, accused Railtrack of 'reneging' on a 5.7 per
cent pay offer for the network's 4,600 signalmen and said that this had
provoked today's strike.
'Railtrack have dealt a body blow to industrial relations and the integrity
of the company is in tatters,' he said.
But Mr Chris Leah, Railtrack's chief negotiator, denied that the company had
ever offered such a rise.
In the Commons, Mr John Major, the prime minister, condemned the strike and
said extra parking would be made available in London. The Department of
Transport said there would be 10,000 more spaces at locations such as Hyde
Park and Regents Park.
Despite the strike, most of London's Underground system will be running.
Police and motoring organisations advised people to share cars or stagger
journeys.
The London Weather Centre has forecast another sunny day today which could
persuade people to stay away from work.
Some big City companies were making arrangements to help employees get to
work. Lloyds Bank, which employs 8,000 in Greater London, has organised 100
coaches to bring in up to 4,000 people from as far as Chelmsford and
Cambridge.
KPMG Peat Marwick, however, which employs 3,000 in London, had made no
contingency plans. A spokeswoman said: 'We expect the vast majority of our
employees will be able to get in.'
Only 15 Underground stations will be affected out of a total of 273. London
Transport said there would be no Tube services on the northern stretch of
the Bakerloo Line from Queens Park to Harrow and Wealdstone or in south
London on the District Line between Turnham Green and Richmond and East
Putney and Wimbledon.
Out of London's two main airports, Gatwick is expected to be hard hit as its
main service into the capital is a Railtrack line to Victoria. It is
expecting 54,000 arrivals today, of which 24 per cent would normally travel
on the Gatwick Express. Extra coaches have been laid on.
Heathrow will be less affected as it is connected to London by Underground.
However it expects extra pressure on car parking.
The strike represents the first serious challenge to the new railway system
which is being fashioned from the framework of British Rail. If Railtrack,
which was set up last April to take over BR's track signalling and stations,
fails to provide a working railroad, it must compensate the train operating
companies.
Railtrack accepts that the signalmen have a genuine grievance over their pay
position. However Mr Leah said last night that any extra rise beyond the
proposed 2.5 per cent for all Railtrack employees would have to come through
negotiation on a new productivity package. Another 24-hour strike has been
planned for next Wednesday. Railtrack faces first serious test, Page 10

FT  15 JUN 94 / Caracas closes 8 finance houses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOSEPH MANN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CARACAS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Venezuelan government yesterday surprised bank depositors by closing
eight troubled financial institutions which it had been keeping afloat since
early this year.
Long lines of sometimes angry depositors formed outside the closed
institutions, which have a combined total of 2m depositors. Some accused the
government of defrauding them of their funds.
The move was the latest by the administration of President Rafael Caldera to
ease a financial system crisis which began in January when Banco Latino,
Venezuela's second largest bank, failed and was taken over by the
government.
Following the collapse of Banco Latino, other insitutions were struck by
runs on their deposits and had to rely heavily on financial aid from the
central bank and the government's bank deposit guarantee fund (Fogade).
The institutions taken over by the government and closed include seven banks
(Amazonas, Bancor, Barinas, Construccion, La Guaira, Maracaibo and
Metropolitano) and a company which financed commercial and industrial
projects, SF Fiveca.
Even though the government had been the de facto owner of these institutions
for some time - it had demanded shares and other assets in return for
financial assistance and had appointed its own administrators - the
authorities felt that the financial aid had reached an unacceptably high
level and that the banks could not be properly restructured without
intervention.
The eight banks had lost a large share of their deposits and had financial
losses amounting to several times their capital. They received the
equivalent of almost Dollars 3bn in government assistance. Questions have
been raised publicly as to whether some of this money was used improperly by
the banks while still controlled by their former owners.
The government had been expected formally to take over the institutions but
the decision to shut the banks was not expected. It emphasises the depth of
a banking crisis which has done much to undermine confidence in the
Venezuelan economy this year.
In announcing the decision, Mr Julio Sosa, finance minister, said that each
depositor would be eligible to receive up to 4m bolivars (Dollars 24,000 or
Pounds 15,900).
In the case of Banco Latino, the government recapitalised and reopened the
institution, paying depositors up to 10m bolivars. However, the authorities
saw no end to the financial aid required by the other eight institutions and
decided to close them down.

FT  15 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Oil bid falters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, CLARE GASCOIGNE and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Enterprise Oil/Lasmo bid battle came to boiling point as the former
surprised the market by unleashing an increased offer for Lasmo, which it
said was worth 165p a share, or a 12 per cent premium on Lasmo's closing
price on Monday. Enterprise had until the end of the week to launch a new
bid.
The market's immediate response was to lift the Lasmo share price to 153p.
However, Lasmo gradually declined, closing a net 4 off at 143 1/2 p after
turnover of 14m, with many specialists adopting the view that the Enterprise
bid is likely to fail. Enterprise fell to 389p before ending 9 down at 390p
after heavy volume of 7.5m.
'The market is clearly indicating the bid will not be successful,' said one
analyst. He said that with Enterprise at its present quotation, Lasmo should
be trading at 160p-plus, rather than the current price of around 143p; the
feeling is that the Americans, who speak for more than 20 per cent of the
equity and paid upwards of these prices, will not sell, nor will Philips &amp;
Drew Fund Management, which speaks for 15 per cent.
Mr John Toalster, oil analyst at Strauss Turnbull, was even more forthright.
'Enterprise is overpaying for Lasmo at the expense of its own shareholders,'
he said.
Institutions now have until July 1 to make up their minds whether to accept
Enterprise's new and final bid.
British Gas shares eased a fraction to 288 1/2 p ahead of publication this
morning of the Ofgas document on rates of return for British Gas's
transportation and storage businesses, which is expected to approve the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission recommendations.
London Electricity, 3 off at 587p, will be the first of the recs to announce
full-year numbers and will set the standard for dividend rises, analysts
said. 'A dividend increase of 15 per cent is expected; anything less will
get the thumbs down; much more will be seen as likely to upset the
regulator, ahead of the distribution review expected in early August,' said
an analyst.
Unigate jumped 22 to 384p after brokers upgraded profits expectations
following the release of better than expected figures.
Smith New court raised its current year estimate by Pounds 4m to Pounds
118m, while BZW upgraded its figure from Pounds 116.5m to Pounds 120m. But
Mr Carl Short at Strauss Turnbull, who lifted his forecast by a modest
Pounds 1.5m to Pounds 118m, sounded a note of caution when he said: 'It is
important to point out that benefits of acquisition will have less of an
impact on the current year's figures.'
Profit-taking hit ICI, which dropped 17 at one point before closing 10 down
at 789p. The fall was in spite of news that the group is considering
spending Pounds 200m on a chemicals plant in Pakistan, a move which analysts
considered promising.
Pharmaceutical stocks recovered their losses from Monday, with Glaxo up 13
1/2 to 563p, Zeneca gaining 14 at 708p and Wellcome rising 5 to 594p. The
main increases came in the early afternoon after the US markets opened
strongly, and the relative performance of SmithKline Beecham units,
predominantly US-owned and up 12 to 370p, compared to the 'A' ordinary
shares, ahead only 8 at 406p, suggested that the main interest came from
America.
However, UK analysts were equally positive; Mr Robin Gilbert at Panmure
Gordon, which recently turned positive on Glaxo, said the bearish stories
surrounding the stock had faded away and the dividend prospects were
improved as the likelihood of buying US drugs distributor McKesson lessened.
The NatWest Securities buy recommendation on National Westminster helped the
shares move up 5 to 464p, but worries that the stalled acquisition of
Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society may yet encounter further problems
saw Lloyds dip 10 to 566p.
Merchant banks were hit by renewed worries of big losses in international
bonds and gilts, with SG Warburg closing a further 8 off at 721p.
Mirror Group, up 3 at 171p, clambered back up above the psychologically
significant 170p mark, the price at which the joint administrator placed its
54.8 per cent share of the stock last September. The rise was on the back of
ABC figures for May, which showed that the Independent had boosted its
circulation from April.
News that Mr Michael Heseltine, president of the board of trade, has
referred the Daily Mail's bid for T. Bailey Forman, publisher of the
Nottingham Evening Post, to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission had little
effect on the shares; Daily Mail &amp; General Trust lost 5 to 1175p. Ms Lorna
Tilbian at SG Warburg said that, with an estimated value for the shares
being around the Pounds 12 mark, the stock would be regarded as 'dead money'
until the autumn.
Discount supermarket group Shoprite suffered a further fall, sliding 27 to
51p on news that the sale and leaseback of 11 Scottish supermarkets had
fallen through.
With the main supermarket chains still maintaining strong pressure on prices
and improving their targeting of specific products for competition, analysts
felt Shoprite had to complete the deal within six months if the group were
to maintain any credibility.
Inchcape relinquished 5 to 468p on reports that it was about to mount a bid
for Gestetner, in which it has a 24.6 per cent stake. The latter rose 3 to
168p.
Suggestions that the impact of the detergent war on Unilever's balance sheet
will not be as great as originally feared saw the shares improve 10 to 1010p
amid trade of 1m.

Shares in Shoprite fell 27p to 51p yesterday after the discount food
retailer said the sale and leaseback of 11 Scottish supermarkets, announced
on May 3, had not been completed.
The anticipated Pounds 1.95m surplus on disposal, therefore, which was

is now Pounds 658,000.
Accordingly, pre-tax profits for the six months to May 1 fell from Pounds

Karstadt, Germany's biggest retailer following the recent purchase of
Hertie, yesterday reported slightly improved annual earnings of DM226.8m
(Dollars 137.4m), up from DM224.1m in 1993.
Group turnover in the first five months of this year soared by 31.7 per cent
compared with the previous year, to DM11bn, helped by strong demand for
tourist services.
Turnover in 1993 rose to DM13.3bn, up from DM12.2bn the year before. The
dividend is increased by DM1 to DM13.
However, Mr Walter Deuss, chief executive, underlined warnings given by
competitors that the retail market was still in a 'recession' despite
forecast economic growth. 'Given the only slight change in the number of
unemployed there is no sign of a fundamental improvement in the consumer
climate,' Mr Deuss said.
The company spent about DM1.6bn earlier this year to buy Hertie, Germany's
third biggest retailer, but said it would take about five years to integrate
the two groups fully.

The Swedish government said yesterday its public offer of a 23 per cent
voting stake in Pharmacia, one of the world's top 20 pharmaceuticals groups,
had been heavily oversubscribed.
It suggests the government will increase the size of the public offer to
47.5m shares from 40m shares, equal to 27.5 per cent of the votes. However,
it will wait until Friday, after the offer to Swedish and international
institutions has closed, before setting share allocation and price. The
government's aim is to sell as many as 82.2m shares in the group, raising
some SKr10bn in Sweden's largest ever privatisation.
This would cut the state's voting stake to 10.1 per cent from 57.5 per cent.

<TEXT>
The Royal Begemann group of the Netherlands emerged yesterday as the leading
contender to take control of Deutsche Waggonbau, the east German
rolling-stock maker owned by the Treuhand privatisation agency.
The company said it had reached agreement on the outlines of a deal under
which it would take over 74.9 per cent of DW stock, while the balance would
remain with the Treuhand for the time being.
The Treuhand, taken unawares by the Begemann announcement, stressed that a
heads-of-agreement paper, containing details of points subject to further
negotiation, would not hinder continuing discussions with other potential
investors.
However, the Dutch group's statement appeared designed to deter any other
would-be investors. Begemann and the Treuhand intended to develop the heads
of agreement into a legally-binding deal, it said.
A deal, which the bidder expects to be completed this year, would mark the
end of a long period of uncertainty for the barely profitable DW, which
supplied most of the former Comecon area's railway goods wagons and
carriages.

FT  15 JUN 94 / MetLife and Travelers to combine health sides
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Metropolitan Life and Travelers are combining their health insurance
businesses in a joint venture company.
It is a further sign of the consolidation under way among US managed
healthcare organisations.
Travelers, which has the smaller health insurance business of the two,
agreed to pass to MetLife disability, dental care and other insurance
businesses with annual premiums of more than Dollars 950m in return for a
half share in the new company.
It is also selling MetLife its group life insurance business for Dollars
350m.
By growing in size, healthcare groups hope to reduce unit costs and force
bigger discounts from healthcare providers, such as hospitals and drugs
companies.
The deal marks the first steps taken by Mr Sanford Weill, whose Primerica
financial services group took over Travelers at the end of last year, to
sort out some parts of Travelers' underperforming insurance operations.
Earlier this year, Mr Weill predicted mergers in the insurance industry as
companies sought greater efficiency.
The two insurers said their new company, which had yet to be named, would
provide health insurance to 13m people.
However, only 391,000 of these are in the two companies' health maintenance
organisations (HMOs), under which individuals are serviced by a prescribed
network of doctors and hospitals.
All US insurers are attempting to move people from their traditional
fee-for-service plans into HMOs, which have become a more profitable way of
providing healthcare cover. HMOs have also become popular among the US
companies which pay for their employees' health insurance. Buying coverage
for the average person in an HMO cost Dollars 3,520 last year, compared with
Dollars 4,370 for traditional health insurance.
In addition to the HMOs, MetLife and Travelers cover a further 4.4m people
under other, looser managed care arrangements, including PPOs (preferred
provider organisations).
The joint venture comes at a time when other managed care organisations are
growing fast.
United Healthcare, which has increased from 2.1m HMO patients at the start
of the year to 3m now, said it planned to use the Dollars 2.3bn cash from
its sale of a drugs distribution company to SmithKline Beecham last month to
expand further through acquisition.

</HEADLINE>

The soft drinks market is among the bloodiest battlefields in the global war
between national and retailer-controlled brands. Cott Corporation, an
upstart Canadian company, is giving Coca-Cola and Pepsi - long considered
two of the most impregnable brands - their stiffest competition in many
years.
Cott has signed supply agreements with 90 retail chains around the world,
including Wal-Mart, the biggest US retailer, and the UK's J. Sainsbury. It
recently began shipments to Japan's second biggest retailer. But nowhere has
Cott made bigger inroads or provoked a more aggressive response from Coke
and Pepsi than in its home market of Ontario. Coke closed half its Canadian
bottling plants in a drive to match Cott's costs.
Cott's chairman, Mr Gerald Pencer, is an entrepreneur whose last venture - a
Canadian trust and loan company - ended in failure.

<TEXT>
The Pakistani government yesterday expressed regret that the two Britons,
Kim Housego and David Mackie, kidnapped by gunmen in Indian-administered
Kashmir last week, had still not been released.
A foreign office official in Islamabad also called on the Indian government
to release Kashmiri fighters, detained 'in violation of all legal, moral and
humanitarian norms'.
The relatives of the two captives had earlier approached Pakistani
authorities to use their influence. The group holding the hostages, the
Harkat-ul-Ansar, has offices in both Indian and Pakistani-administered
Kashmir territories.
A number of groups of Kashmiri activists, as well as the semi-autonomous
government of the Pakistani-administered side, have called on the captors to
release the two hostages.
Mr Mohammed Farooq Kashmiri, leader of the group, says he has ordered his
mujahideen (freedom fighters) to release them. But the group says it is not
able to ensure the release due to an Indian military presence in the area
where the captives are being kept.
Indian officials have assured Mr David Housego, a former Financial Times
Journalist and Kim's father, that the gunmen will be given safe passage if
they agree to return the two Britons. But it is not clear if such assurances
will satisfy the gunmen.

FT  15 JUN 94 / Trade unions in campaign to halt child labour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) launched a
global campaign yesterday to eradicate child labour, including a boycott of
exports made by exploited, under-age workers, Reuter reports from Geneva.
Mr Enzo Friso, general secretary of the world's largest international labour
grouping, took the case for a link between trade and labour conditions to Mr
Peter Sutherland, chief of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 'This
shameful phenomenon has grown over the last years,' Mr Friso told a news
briefing in Geneva. 'It is a serious problem which requires state
intervention.
'We are going to campaign for a boycott to stop goods made by children from
gaining access to foreign markets,' he added.
In a new report, the Brussels-based ICFTU says from 100m to 200m children
under 15 are working in streets, factories and mines, mainly in South Asia
and Latin America.
They include children working in coal mines in Colombia, gold mines in Peru,
as construction workers in Bangladesh, as 'slaves' in Pakistan weaving
carpets, sweet vendors in Mexico, and in garment factories in the
Philippines.
The 13-page report, 'Child Labour: the world's best kept secret', contains
documentation from ICFTU affiliates on abuses in India, Bangladesh, Nepal,
Mexico and the Philippines.
'A number of multinationals are currently under investigation by ICFTU
experts,' it says. 'All companies discovered to be using child labour will
be exposed and the companies will be the target of special union campaigns.'
Mr Bjorne Grimsrud, ICFTU campaign organiser, declined to name suspected
multinationals but said: 'It is important to get to the sub-contractors
level because that is where you find the child labour.'
In a statement, ICFTU said the campaign would include an international
boycott of hand-woven carpets from Nepal, India and Pakistan, unless they
were labelled with a guarantee that child workers were not involved in
production.
The ICFTU has 174 labour union affiliates in 124 countries, representing
120m workers. During the cold war it campaigned for workers' rights in
Communist countries.
The appeal was made on the fringes of the annual meeting of the
International Labour Organisation, whose director general, Mr Michel
Hansenne, is also pressing for workers' rights to be closely tied to global
economic and trade decisions.
Mr Friso called for a 'social clause' to be used as an international weapon
against child exploitation and other abuses of workers' rights at the future
World Trade Organisation. 'We want a social clause . . . to prevent the
import of goods from a country when its government does not take measures
against exploitation of children,' he said.

FT  15 JUN 94 / Low forecast for training
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Many employers plan to spend no more - and some will spend less - on
training in the next 20 years, says a report today from Huthwaite, the
training organisation.
The survey involved directors and senior managers from 150 companies
employing about 2.5m people. They were asked to assess the competitive
skills and training challenges facing their companies.
Twenty-five per cent of employers intended to spend no more on training
while 5 per cent said they intended to spend less. Only 12 per cent forecast
a big increase.
Companies appear to be introducing cheaper forms of training. More coaching
by line managers and supervisors will be the most popular development method
while classroom training will tend towards short and frequent modular
programmes. 'Open' or 'distance' learning - in which an individual typically
learns at his or her own pace from a package - will continue to grow in
significance.
Questioned about business organisation, respondents said that new employment
practices, such as part - time working or job-sharing, would not in
themselves do much to solve the unemployment problem as they did not
anticipate a wholesale switch to these.

FT  15 JUN 94 / CBI welcome for 'changed' Labour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ and PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Howard Davies, the director-general of the CBI, yesterday underlined
Labour's growing appeal to traditional Tory voters by calling on business
leaders to pay serious attention to the party's economic policies.
In a speech to business leaders in London, Mr Davies said that Labour had
'changed in important ways' and was now willing to talk to business leaders
constructively.
His comments came as Mr Tony Blair, the front-runner for the Labour
leadership, underlined once again his commitment to turn Labour into the
party of 'law and order'.
Delivering the Police Foundation lecture at London's Guildhall, Mr Blair
said that his party's strategy to combat crime would be based on restoring
the sense of responsibility and respect among, in particular, young people.
In government, Labour would seek to provide the opportunity for individual
self-advancement but with that chance would come the 'duties of citizenship'
Disparaging the government's police reforms, Mr Blair said effective
policing depended on the re-establishment of strong and effective links
between police, local authorities, business and other organisations rooted
in local communities.
Other agencies should share responsibility with the police to create a
'proper partnership against crime'.
Mr Davies said that the party still had a number of policies with which the
CBI disagreed, such as its commitment to the social chapter of the
Maastricht treaty and a statutory minimum wage.
In one of the strongest indications yet of the rapprochement between Labour
and industry, Mr Davies said: 'It seems likely we shall be facing a Labour
leadership without any baggage from previous episodes in power, and with a
set of economic policies rather different from those which held sway in the
people's party for most of the 1980s.'
He added: 'It would be churlish not to recognise that the Labour party has
changed in important ways, and is offering a set of policies which, at the
very least deserve our attention. We shall give it.'

FT  15 JUN 94 / Labour shrugs off SNP threat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Labour party yesterday declared its determination to beat off the
challenge from the Scottish National party in the Monklands East
by-election, due to take place on June 30 and caused by the death last month
of John Smith.
Labour has gone for a quick by-election in the constituency, which mainly
comprises Airdrie, to the east of Glasgow, in order to try to prevent the
campaign by the SNP from gaining momentum.
It is defending a majority of 15,712 in what should be a safe seat, but
fears the SNP will profit from the bandwagon effect generated by its success
in last month's regional elections and its impressive victory this week in
the North East Scotland Euro-seat.
Yesterday Mr Alex Salmond, the SNP leader, acknowledged that his party had
'an electoral mountain to climb' but that it had the wind at its back and
had clambered some way up the hill already.
Mr George Robertson, shadow Scottish secretary, said that the SNP could not
be 'alternative Tories in the north-east of Scotland and then come down to
Airdrie and be alternative socialists. That won't wash here'.
The central belt of Scotland is much less promising territory for the SNP
than the more rural north-east.
However, it has the capacity to pour activists into by-elections and snatch
victory, as it did when it won the Glasgow Govan by-election from Labour in
1988.
In the regional elections the SNP won one of the two regional council seats
in the constituency. It will exploit claims that a small clique of Labour
councillors dominates Monklands district council.
Labour's candidate is Mrs Helen Liddell, a former secretary of the party in
Scotland who then worked for the late Robert Maxwell on the Daily Record,
the Scottish subsidiary of Mirror Group Newspapers.
The SNP on Monday night chose Mrs Kay Ullrich, a social worker and its
deputy defence spokesman, as its candidate.
The Tories have selected Mrs Susan Bell, a businesswoman who is
vice-president of the Scottish Tory Reform Group. The Liberal Democrat
candidate is Mr Stephen Gallagher, an NHS administrator.

'From my point of view, it was the best thing they ever did - closing down
the pit,' says Robert McDiarmid, a former miner at the Sherwood Colliery in
Mansfield, Nottinghamshire. Mr McDiarmid now manages a local pub. 'I am
enjoying a new lease on life,' he says.
Mr McDiarmid worked in the Sherwood Colliery for 20 years as a mechanic,
chargeman fitter and a shift charger engineer. When the pit closed in
February 1992, he was made redundant with 800 others. He had been down in
the pit since the age of 16, although his father, also a miner, tried to
dissuade him from taking a job there.
After the colliery closed, Mr McDiarmid took a 'three month holiday' and
then got in touch with a friend at Mansfield Brewery. The friend told him
about an opening for an assistant manager at one of the brewery's licensed
pubs, The Swan. He applied and got the job. He spent four months there
before he moved to The Crown Hotel in Southwell, where he was manager for 16
months.
Two months ago, he returned to The Swan to take over as manager, heading up
Mansfield Brewery's most profitable pub, which turns over more than Pounds
1m a year.
Mr McDiarmid says the job resembles the work he did at the pit. As a shift
charge engineer at Sherwood Colliery in the last five years of his tenure he
was responsible for the day to day mechanical operations of the pit and
oversaw 40 men. At the pub he has a staff of 55. 'The job here is about
managing people, and the job I had before was about managing people,' he
says.
He admits he occasionally misses the camaraderie of the pit, but he does not
miss the work. 'The people who miss it are generally those who have found
nothing else,' he says.
It is difficult for many ex-miners to find satisfying jobs, because the
skills they used in mining are not easy to transfer out of the pit. Peter
Newham, a former ropes master splicer at the Cotgrave colliery, which closed
down last April, replaced and maintained steel ropes on haulage installers
in the mine. 'There is no call for these skills elsewhere,' he said.
Now he is a fish salesman in Loughbrough, a 15-mile drive from his home.
What he misses most, he says, is the 'laughs with the lads'.
Many ex-miners yearn for the team spirit of the pit. 'You miss the
comradeship,' said Alan Brown, an ex-miner and member of the Cotgrave town
council. 'You used to work with a team and you worked with the same men for
years. You knew how they ticked, they knew how you ticked and you trusted
them.'
In addition to the personal losses, the financial blow has been significant.
Mr Newham and his family moved to Cotgrave in 1987 from Bulwell when the
Hucknall Colliery, where he had worked since 1979, was shut down. When he
came to Nottinghamshire, he was told he would have a job for life, and his
family took on a large mortgage. 'Five years later, we were back in the same
position,' his wife Sheila said.
Many other families have been similarly affected by pit closures. 'There are
people who feel trapped because they were encouraged to buy properties and
make commitments on the basis of salaries that no longer exist,' said Bryan
Barrodale, parish priest in Cotgrave.
Mr Barrodale said that the husband of a couple he recently married was a
winding engineer at the colliery and is now a cheesemaker making 50 per cent
less than he did at the mine.
When Mr Brown first took a redundancy from the Cotgrave colliery in 1989, he
took a job as a part-time school caretaker. 'It cost me more in petrol to
get there than I was making,' he said. Now he has a full time caretaker's
job at Tollerton Primary School, about 10 miles from Cotgrave.
Still, he is making nothing like what he was earning in the pit. 'We knew
before we left the pit we would never get a job making that kind of money,'
said Mr Brown.
Even miners who have been able to get new jobs using their engineering or
manufacturing skills have taken pay cuts. 'Coal mining is one of the elite
jobs in manufacturing,' said Carl Leonard, Greater Nottinghamshire Tec's
special projects manager in charge of communities affected by pit closures.
'It is very difficult for the men to get jobs that have equivalent salaries
because the job market has changed.'
Mr Brown is sees the bright side, however. As a caretaker, he does not have
to contend with the three shifts a week that mining required. 'We used to
call the 11:15 pm to 6:30 am shift the happy shift because we were so
miserable,' he said. 'It is marvellous now to have a regular day shift. The
kids say to me, 'why are you singing Mr Brown?' and I say 'of course I am -
I am not working nights any more'.'

FT  14 JUN 94 / Survey of Nottinghamshire Coalfields Regeneration (5): A way
of life transformed - A look at the effects pit closure have had on Cotgrave
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the last tower was blasted from the Cotgrave colliery pit two months
ago, a crowd gathered on the grassy knoll overlooking the scratched earth
below. Vernon Coaker, vice-chairman of the town council in this village,
about six miles south-east of Nottingham, remembers one man saying: 'What an
unbelievable act of industrial vandalism.'
When the pit was closed, 609 miners - 218 of them from Cotgrave - lost the
jobs they had been promised would last through their grandchildren's
lifetime. Many are still unemployed and those who have found work have often
taken pay cuts as a result of a move into unskilled labour. 'You have a lot
of people with engineering and mechanical skills who are just not using
them,' said Mr Coaker. 'It is such a waste of talent and experience.'
At the height of its production, the colliery employed 2,000 miners. More
than 35 per cent of the town's families have relatives who worked in the
mine at some time during its life. The coming of the pit transformed
Cotgrave. Sitting incongruously in the middle of Nottinghamshire's Green
Belt in the heart of the constituency of Kenneth Clarke, chancellor of the
exchequer, the colliery attracted miners from pits which had closed down in
Scotland and the north of England.
After the pit was opened in 1964, Cotgrave transformed a rural population of
300 into a mining village of 8,000. Within 18 months of the colliery's first
shift, a housing estate for the miners had been built up in an arc around
the old village.
Mining, as the only industry in the village, gives Cotgrave its identity.
'The pit was the social glue of the town,' said Mr Coaker. 'Everything
revolved around the pit. People lived, worked and socialised together. It
was a total commitment to a way of life.'
Today, more than a year after Cotgrave's colliery shut down, the town is
still a close-knit community where ex-miners tease each other in the Miners
Welfare bar and neighbours call out friendly greetings to each other on the
streets.
But subtle changes have left concerns that the atmosphere created by the pit
is deteriorating. 'We have a lot of commuters moving in who do not take part
in the village,' said Alan Brown, an ex-miner and a town councillor.
It is not just harmony within the village that is threatened. Individual
families are suffering as well. 'One woman from a young couple told me that
since her husband left the pit, they have done nothing but argue,' said
Bryan Barrodale, Rector of the Cotgrave Anglican Parish.
For many wives of ex-miners, having their husbands out of work upsets
dynamics in the home. 'A lot of families were adjusted to living with three
shifts at the mine,' said Sheila Newham, wife of an ex-miner and former head
of the Cotgrave Women's Action Group, which campaigned to keep the pit open.
'Suddenly having their husbands at home all day is a big change. That is
probably one reason why many women have gone to work.'
Several Cotgrave women have taken jobs or started child minding. 'Men are
becoming house husbands and women are becoming the bread winners,' said Ken
Stobbard, another ex-miner from Calverton, a nearby pit, and a county
councillor who is unemployed while his wife works.
The pit's closure has also highlighted Cotgrave's lack of services, such as
a secondary school, cheap shops, and now, a bank. TSB closed down Cotgrave's
only branch in April. Some local officials believe the speed of the pit's
arrival may have distracted attention from plans to bring such resources to
the village. 'The pit cut across a lot of long term planning schemes, and
the town never got a lot of the resources it deserved,' said Eric Woolsey, a
town and borough councillor.
Another problem is that Cotgrave - traditionally surrounded by affluence -
has not been eligible for assisted area status or EU funding. Officials are
determined to take advantage of government money that is available in the
wake of the pit closure. 'If one good thing will come out of the pit
shutting down it will be that we will get some of the services we should
have had but never did,' said Mr Coaker.
To date, the town has received Pounds 400,000 from the government's
Coalfield Area Fund. With the money, Rushcliffe Borough Council has built
six industrial units on the edge of the village which have been let to small
businesses. Nottinghamshire County Council will use a portion of the money
to build an additional four units on to the town's leisure centre, which is
now being renovated.
The county council is also funneling money into Cotgrave through the 'New
Deal for Nottinghamshire', a county-wide response to pit closures in the
area. The council has set aside money for training, traffic management,
environmental improvement and job creation.
A month after the pit closed, Greater Nottinghamshire Tec opened an
Opportunities Advice Centre to help the miners who had been made redundant
and other local unemployed residents to find jobs and get training or
further education in new fields.
It also provides a Citizens Advice Bureau service once a week. Benefit
advice is by far the most sought after. When the centre opened, 577 people
were registered unemployed in Cotgrave. Of these, 252 have been placed in
jobs, leaving unemployment in the village running about 9 per cent, with 30
miners still using the centre's services. It has also helped some of the
town's long-term unemployed to find jobs.
Government funding for the Opportunities Advice Centre will cease in May of
1995. Carl Leonard, Special Projects Manager for Greater Nottinghamshire
Tec, said: 'We will have an exit strategy. We won't just pull out the plug
and go.'
Coaker believes the centre is doing a good job, but arrived too late. 'Why
did they build a lifeboat when the ship was sinking?' he said.
While training people for new jobs is an immediate response to the pit
closure, local officials want to bring new industry on to the pit site.
British Coal and Rushcliffe Borough Council have produced a development
brief for the colliery, where they hope one industrial or leisure developer
will take over the whole site.
Local officials believe the site's rural location, and proximity to rail
lines, makes it an ideal site for a large factory or leisure park. In 1995,
the A46, which runs near the former colliery, will be turned into a dual
carriageway and officials believe it will provide the infrastructure for
industry.
Mr Coaker says: 'Whatever happens here it won't produce the same amount of
jobs that the pit did. However much you do you will never replace what has
gone.'
However, for ex-miners, what is important is the thought of a job. If new
industry was built on the pit site, Peter Newham, a former miner from
Cotgrave, says: 'I would be one of the first on the door step applying for a
job'.

FT  14 JUN 94 / Survey of Nottinghamshire Coalfields Regeneration (7): A
focus for revival - The textiles industry offers good prospects for jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The textiles and clothing industry, so often associated with industrial
decline in the face of low cost competitors, is emerging as one of the main
immediate hopes for a revival of the Nottinghamshire economy.
This is partly defensive. Even if employment levels in the industry have
been declining for decades, there are, says Howard Jackson, director of the
county council's planning and economic development department, '27,000 still
employed in clothing and textiles in Notts. We clearly can't afford to see
that go down'.
The industry's geographical location is also significant. Clothing and
textiles are better represented in the coalfield area than in the national
economy. But what seemed an industry of limited prospects has received a
boost from the establishment of a plant in Mansfield by Toray Textiles
Europe and the decision of Johnson Controls to manufacture car seat covers
in the town. The task now is to turn these isolated inward investments into
the core of growth.
Toray's site, in fact, is close to the forthcoming Mansfield enterprise zone
and the district council has acquired 60 acres next door, opening up the
possibility of a new textiles and clothing manufacturing district. Indeed,
the council has started receiving investment enquiries from companies in the
sector.
In the longer term, growth prospects are likely to depend on a strengthening
ability to produce high quality products following the example of Germany in
the rebuilding of its clothing industry.
The Nottinghamshire International Clothing Centre - developed by the county
council but drawing extensively on the services of Nottingham Trent
University - will be a focal point for the latest technology, design and
practice in the industry.
Efforts to regenerate the textiles and clothing industry show the way in
which the county is developing its infrastructure in order to extract faster
growth. Because the economy cannot rely on inward investment but must depend
on companies in business, the quickest way to generate growth is to support
them and encourage diversification into more technologically advanced
products.
Such growth is possible in the Nottinghamshire engineering industry which,
with coal mining and textiles, has been a pillar of the traditional county
economy. It will remain so despite the long term trend of lower job numbers
and competition resulting from the strengthening of the EU's internal
market.
The loss of the coal mine market has companies chasing new products. It is
hoped Toyota's new car plant in Derbyshire will provide a new stimulus. But
the speed of growth in the longer term will depend on strengthening the
academic-industrial nexus. Although Nottingham University has its Highfield
science park, facilities designed to profit from the research capabilities
of the universities have not yet been expanded.
The universities have been active in research vital to regional industry -
Nottingham University's work on composite materials for the automotive
industry, for example - and they are becoming increasingly active in
applying expertise to immediate economic problems - Nottingham Trent
University's work in encouraging technology transfer in the north of the
county is an example.
But experience elsewhere has shown that the quickest economic
diversification is likely to come from the provision of services, in the way
that Coventry sought to offset erosion of the manufacturing base by
establishing a back office sector during the 1980s.
Thus importance is attached to the decision of the Inland Revenue to
establish offices in Nottingham which open next year employing 2,000 people.
Accountants and bankers in the city of Nottingham see considerable scope to
expand the provision of financial services as none of the cities in the East
Midlands has a dominant role such as that of Birmingham in the West
Midlands.
But none of this is of relevance to a redundant miner in a village near
Mansfield. In the north of the county, where sympathies often lie closer to
Sheffield than Nottingham, Pat Richards, chief executive of the North
Nottinghamshire Tec, sees 'an emerging common vision'.
This envisages a development project which would draw attention to the area
and create jobs, such as Glasgow Hospital and the conference centre in
Maastricht, Netherlands. How such a scheme might be funded is unclear.
Ideas about the nature of growth are therefore more clear for the medium and
long-term than the short term, where corporate health and job prospects
remain tightly linked to the movements of the national economy.
Hence the concern of agencies such as the Tec and British Coal Enterprise to
help companies in the difficult process of emerging from recession and
equipping former miners for jobs as they become available.
The demand for such a jobs service is clear. The Tec, at what it calls its
gateways, received 27,655 visits between October 1993 and last April which
resulted in more than 6,200 interviews.
The outcome was that 232 people were placed in jobs and a further 260 people
were offered training and guidance of different types. British Coal
Enterprise said that it had been resettling miners at the rate of 100 a week
either in jobs or retraining for a specific post. What it will not undertake
is training on a speculative basis.

FT  14 JUN 94 / Survey of Nottinghamshire Coalfields Regeneration (2):
Process still painful - Services sector growth is not fast enough
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The rundown of the county coalfield is both part of a long-term trend and a
manifestation of a realignment in the county economy. The trend away from
traditional industries and the growing emphasis on light manufacture and
services is thus part of a wider national phenomenon, but no less painful
for that.
Seen in crude figures for employment covering the whole of the county, jobs
lost in the collieries during the 1980s were amply offset by the rise in the
number of jobs available in the services sector. This has emerged in the
growth of local financial, distribution and catering services and the
expansion of jobs in education, health and public administration.
But the county figures tell only part of the story. In the first place, the
growth in the financial services sector has been marked in the south of the
county, around Nottingham. With one exception, Cotgrave, the working mines
of the 1990s have been in the east and north of the county. There is thus
some geographical mismatch between those needing jobs and those readily able
to provide them.
Analysis of the latest unemployment figures, as the national economy moves
out of recession, shows falls in the areas around Nottingham and Newark, a
significant manufacturing centre. But there have been rises in the areas
where coalmining has been the dominant economic influence.
Second, the speed of closures since the government's first announcement of
major changes at British Coal in October 1992 has upset any notions of a
cosy trade-off in jobs between one sector and another.
Between 1961 and 1992, 44,000 colliery jobs and 26 pits were lost. In the
last 18 months, more than 8600 jobs and nine pits were lost.
As elsewhere in the UK, the role of the services sector has been growing in
the county economy. It now accounts for 62 per cent of jobs. But the growth
has not been quick enough to absorb a sudden influx of people on to the
labour market.
Third, the mines have been a source of well-paid employment. 'All
mineworkers getting other jobs can expect to have drop in pay - the vast
majority at any rate,' said Winsor Lewis, Midlands regional manager of
British Coal Enterprise.
This has been borne out by a survey of former Silverhill miners, carried out
by the Coalfield Communities Campaign. This showed a fall in average weekly
pay from Pounds 243 to Pounds 149. It showed that half of the new jobs won
by former miners were in factories and warehouses.
These three factors provide a pattern of a well-paid and concentrated
industry, frequently in relatively isolated pockets away from the growth
areas of the county economy.
Yet the rundown of the coalfield cannot be seen in narrow geographical
terms. The spending power of the individual miner may have been brought to
bear in particular localities, but the spending power of British Coal
influenced much wider areas.
The withdrawal of much of that spending has not yet been fully quantified.
But in recent months there has been a series of redundancy announcements at
companies adjusting to the loss of British Coal demand. Herbert Cotterill,
Dale Group, Longwall Roof Support Repairs are cases in point.
Last November, Nottingham Trent University contacted 26 companies supplying
British Coal. It found that half had scaled down their investment intentions
and had, on average, reduced numbers on the payroll by 15 per cent.
Companies highly dependent on British Coal were having difficulties in
securing bank loans.
But the uncertainty among British Coal suppliers is matched by uncertainty
about the fate of its customers for the remaining collieries. The
Nottinghamshire pits have been reliant on coal-fired power stations, of
which there are five in the county alongside the River Trent.
The switch from coal-fired to gas-fired power stations makes the future of
these power stations, and possibly 1,500 jobs, unclear. Any closures would
have an effect on the future of the coal rail freight network.
Such changes would speed the reduction of the county's traditional
industrial base. The problem arising from the coalfield closures is that,
latterly, they have come too quickly for the economy easily to adjust to the
extra twist of change.
This is made more difficult to handle because of a longer term downturn in
the number of jobs provided by the textile and engineering industries.
Between 1981 and 1991, that is just after the recession had started to bite,
employment in the metal goods, engineering and vehicles sector fell 27 per
cent and in the 'other manufacturing' sector, which includes textiles, it
fell by 21 per cent.
Further, the speed at which small companies were growing throughout the
1980s was slower than the national average. The growth in the number of
businesses registered for VAT was 20.7 per cent for Nottinghamshire, against
27.2 per cent for the East Midlands and 28.4 per cent for the UK.
So when the future of the coalfield was thrown into doubt, the county's
economic position was relatively weak. Phil Asquith, director of economic
development at Mansfield District Council, referring to two inward
investments, said: 'Each step forward, like bringing in Toray and Johnson
Controls, and the government shuts another pit - so its like walking the
wrong way on a moving pavement at an airport.'

FT  14 JUN 94 / Survey of Nottinghamshire Coalfields Regeneration (3):
Private prospects are good - The county's coalfield has fared better than
most
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nottinghamshire, understandably, is grieving. To many miners it must seem
that their industry has been virtually wiped out. But as their former
colleagues in other areas can tell them, it could have been a lot worse.
Nottinghamshire may have just six working pits left compared with several
hundred in the mining heyday of the early twentieth century and 25 just 10
year ago. But that is six more than the north-east of England and Kent, for
example, both of which were once proud deep mine regions but now have none
in operation.
Leaving aside the tiny mines of the Welsh valleys, Nottinghamshire has a
quarter of the total 16 mines that are being sold by the government in five
'core' regions. It also has two pits, Calverton and Clipstone, which have
been re-opened under licence this year by RJB Mining, the private coal
company, after being rejected as unprofitable by British Coal.
In addition Nottinghamshire is the headquarters of several companies and
organisations that either will or want to play a role in the privatised
industry. The Union of Democratic Mineworkers and Caledonian Mining are
among those considering bids for at least one of the five regions.
The government has decided that the Coal Authority, which will be
responsible for licensing all coal mining activities in the UK and for
maintaining mining records, will be based in Nottinghamshire.
That the county's deep mining industry has survived at all, albeit in a
truncated form, is partly because of the relatively thick and accessible
seams of coal available in the centre of the country.
Being close to the UK's biggest concentration of remaining coal-fired power
stations in Yorkshire and Nottinghamshire has helped.
Also influential has been the political debt owed by the government to
miners who continued to work during the 1984-5 national pits strike. Most of
working miners were based in Nottinghamshire and most of them subsequently
joined the Union of Democratic Mineworkers when it was set up as a breakaway
from the National Union of Mineworkers in 1985.
The UDM's leaders have had considerable access to ministers and they have
used it to good effect. The decline of the UDM and its Nottinghamshire
heartland has been marked since its formation in 1985, but not nearly so
severe as that of the NUM and the national industry.
While UDM-controlled pits have shrunk to about a quarter of their 1985 total
of 25, the number of pits in the industry as a whole has fallen from 170 to
about 24, a sevenfold decline.
'The UDM and Nottinghamshire has been protected by the government, to some
extent at least,' according to one former British Coal executive. 'But it is
only partly because of the political debt from the strike. The fact is that
Nottinghamshire miners have shown time and again that they were willing to
adapt to changed circumstances.
'They have always been more flexible about working hours than colleagues in
other areas, for example.'
That willingness was demonstrated again recently when more than 90 per cent
of Notts miners accepted a package giving them a Pounds 6,000 lump sum
payment provided they accepted the 12-hour shifts and compulsory weekend
work.
In the central north region, which has nine mines less and is based in
Yorkshire, less than 50 per cent agreed to the package which also provides a
maximum redundancy package of Pounds 27,000.
In one sense the disparity between the acceptance rates should make central
south - which comprises the four Nottinghamshire mines of Bilsthorpe,
Harworth, Thorseby, and Welbeck, with Asfordby in Leicestershire, and Daw
Mill, in Warwickshire - more attractive to potential bidders than central
north.
In another sense it will make it less attractive. Owners of central north
would face redundancy bills of less than Pounds 7,000 per worker if they
decide to make reductions among those who have not accepted British Coal's
package.
What is not in doubt, however, is central south's saleability. The
government may not get much money for any of the five British Coal regions
it is divesting but there are enough potential buyers around to ensure that
each will be find a buyer.
In all, 33 companies have told NM Rothschild, advising the government, that
they want to pre-qualify to bid for at least one of the packages. Rothschild
will not say how many have sought to pre-qualify for central south.
However, it is understood that the list includes RJB Mining, a conglomerate
comprising the UDM and Coal Investments, a company headed by Malcolm
Edwards, a management buy-out consortium headed by Bob Siddall, British Coal
opencast director, and RTZ, the international mining conglomerate.
The package's attractions include stockpiles of 5.2m tonnes and contracts to
sell the two main electricity generators 11m to 12m tonnes of coal a year
until 1998. It also has five opencast sites, all outside Nottinghamshire.
Reserves amount to about 220m tonnes compared with annual output in 1993-4
of 11.5m tonnes. But that does not mean that all the mines in the package
will survive into the next century.
Harworth is thought to have 60 to 70 years of reserves but Bilsthorpe is
unlikely to last more than three to four years unless large sums are spent
on finding access to new seams. Nor can there be any guarantees about the
future of the two former British Coal mines which are already being operated
by RJB.
Richard Budge, chief executive, says the mines are exceeding their
production and productivity targets and that there is no problem in finding
them a market. Others remain to be convinced.
British Coal executives accept that there may be a market for about six pits
that it has closed. But up to nine are being opened around the country. Neil
Clarke, British Coal chairman, has warned that there could be casualties.
That is far too pessimistic, according to the private sector miners,
including RJB.
Nonetheless there are few who doubt that further contraction is to come in
the mining industry. Nottinghamshire's six mines may be good for a few years
yet. But it is doubtful that the county will retain jobs for all 3,500
miners still in employment. Demands for increases in productivity in the
mines now owned by British Coal will see to that.

FT  14 JUN 94 / Survey of Nottinghamshire Coalfields Regeneration (4): Gates
open to financing - The area is now eligible for UK and EU help
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The economic plight of the Nottinghamshire coalfield has raised the
eligibility of the area for a bewildering battery of finance from both the
UK government and from the European Union. It has spurred the activity of
local agencies fostering economic revival.
The October 1992 announcement of coal mine closures by Michael Heseltine,
the trade and industry secretary, was accompanied by promises of assistance
from the government, some of which has materialised, some of which has yet
to appear.
Last year's redrawing of the UK Assisted Areas map left the Mansfield
travel-to-work area, the largest town affected by the coalfield problems, as
a development area. Ashfield, on the east side of the county, Worksop and
Retford are intermediate areas.
This designation, by the department of trade and industry, allows companies,
either in or coming to the area, subsidies for projects which maintain or
increase the number of jobs. The status provides an additional inducement to
potential inward investors.
The government has also promised extra help through fresh funding for North
Nottinghamshire training and enterprise council. One tranche of this has
been secured. The Tec has signed a contract with the government which over
two years and at a cost of Pounds 7m will provide training and support for
miners from the Bevercotes, Clipstone and Silverhill pits.
A further contract, covering the miners from the Bentinck-Annesley and
Ollerton pits which is yet to be signed will provide roughly the same amount
of funding as the first agreement. Given that the Tec's usual budget is
Pounds 20m a year, the extra sums represent a considerable financial uplift.
In a third move, the government overcame its antipathy towards an economic
stimulation device of the early 1980s and promised to set up enterprise
zones. Companies setting up within them will benefit from an exemption from
the uniform business rate, capital allowances on new buildings and relaxed
planning controls. But progress has been slow and statutory procedures
allowing their opening will not be completed until the autumn. In fact, the
acreage allotted to the zones is less than had been hoped for locally.
There will be three: one of 165 acres next to Junction 27 of the M1, which
will probably end up as a business park, another of 45 acres on the site of
the old Mansfield colliery and a third of 40 acres on the site of the old
Manton colliery.
Mansfield District Council has set its criteria for use of its zone. 'We
wanted to avoid moving jobs from one part of Mansfield to another,' said
Phil Asquith, head of economic development. 'New projects must create, per
acre, 25 new jobs in the district of Mansfield, although not necessarily in
the enterprise zone.'
Further government funding will become available through the Single
Regeneration Budget, administered through the government's regional office.
How much is not clear.
The amounts will depend on the skill of local groups in assembling
public-private-voluntary partnerships to run specific projects. The
government is introducing competition in order to sort out bids from across
the country for a limited pot of funds.
'Cash is tight this year,' says Mr Asquith. Mansfield, however, is pulling
together 'an area bid which focuses into neighbourhood bids. The government
is looking not just for a wish list - it wants projects to hang together, as
does English Partnerships'.
The aim is to bring together different sectors of the community and to make
sure that the private sector plays its role in the wider regeneration
process. This inevitably means a widening role for agencies where the public
and private sectors come together, such as Mansfield 2010, Nottingham
Development Enterprise and the Mansfield, Sutton and Kirkby Enterprise
Partnership.
English Partnerships now controls regeneration funding such as the old
derelict land grant. 'We used to do well with the derelict land grant. We're
waiting to see what will be given now. There were no major schemes in
1993-94,' said Howard Jackson, director of the county council's planning and
economic development department.
Eligible for finance
Continued from page 2
Hopes of being able to obtain up to Pounds 5m during the last financial year
from English Partnerships were thwarted, but the council hopes this year for
funding of that order.
Other government bodies involved in the coalfield include the Rural
Development Commission, which is active in small projects running from the
recycling of furniture to housing advice and training.
The Rural Development Commission is part of an informal coalition of
organisations which co-operate on an ad hoc basis to succour new and
existing business. With British Coal Enterprise, the county council and
North Nottinghamshire Tec, it is a source of venture capital and loan
funding.
Amounts are small by the standards of private sector venture capitalists.
The Tec, which, said Pat Richards, the chief executive, had supported 300
companies over the past two years, has a limit of Pounds 15,000 on the loans
it will provide.
British Coal Enterprise has what it calls '250 live clients' in the Midlands
 -it does not keep its statistics on a county basis - and has funded 639
projects in all. It is prepared to provide loans of up to Pounds 1m and
equity capital of between Pounds 25,000 and Pounds 250,000. Often the
lending is unsecured. 'We are very much at the risky end of the market,'
said Winsor Lewis, the Midlands regional manager.
This panoply of funding is significant in drawing in funds from Brussels. EU
funding depends on the provision of local funding at a matching figure, so
no UK involvement means no European involvement. In the past Nottinghamshire
successfully attracted European finance through the Regional Development
Fund for economically weak areas, the Social Fund, a source of money for
training, Rechar, directed at restructuring coal mine areas and Retex,
concentrating on areas where the textile industry has declined.
Council officials recently reported that Regional Development and Rechar
could provide Pounds 65m of funding for appropriate programmes over the next
three years. This would be a fillip to infrastructure projects as the county
puts its economy on to a new tack.

FT  14 JUN 94 / Survey of Nottinghamshire Coalfields Regeneration (1): Base
for expansion strengthens - Growing financial and services sectors and the
availability of new funding are paving the way for investment

<TEXT>
The Nottinghamshire economy faces challenges in the 1990s, the scale of
which was never dreamed of in the 1980s when the future of the coalfield
seemed secure. These challenges involve a shift away from reliance on
traditional industries to an economy based more widely on services and light
manufacturing.
The background is the sudden and drastic rundown of the coal industry as the
power industry switches to the generation of electricity by gas, instead of
by coal, its traditional fuel. The Nottinghamshire pits have been closely
tied to the power generation industry.
From 1961 to 1992, the number of pits had been declining, but slowly. The
number fell from 39 to 13 while the number of pit jobs fell from 56,000, or
18 per cent of county's male workforce to less than 12,000. This was part of
a nationwide phenomenon.
But in the mid-1980s, after the end of the mineworkers strike and following
the emergence during the strike of the Union of Democratic Mineworkers, the
future of the rump of the industry looked secure.
Margaret Thatcher, then prime minister, seemed to owe the UDM, the members
of which stayed at work during the strike, a political debt for breaking the
power of the National Union of Mineworkers.
Within the last 18 months, however, since the announcement by Michael
Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary in October 1992, of a further
rundown in the coal industry, a further nine Nottinghamshire pits have
closed. The workforce has declined to 3,200 and is expected to be 2,800 by
September.
The county council believes at least Pounds 250m a year is being taken out
of the economy, given the amount British Coal spent on wages and supplies.
Such a sharp change in the fortunes of the local coal industry would have
been difficult enough for the economy to absorb in the best of
circumstances.
But the rundown came when the economy was in recession. It coincided with
the equally long-running problems of other staple industries: textiles,
subject to intense overseas competition, and engineering where, also since
the 1980s, there has been a decline in employment as employers have adopted
new manufacturing techniques.
Overall, the effect has been to reduce the strength of the county economy.
'In the early 1980s Notts had the highest gross domestic product of the five
East Midlands counties,' said Howard Jackson, director of the
Nottinghamshire County Council's planning and economic development
department.
'We've slumped next to bottom place over Derbyshire. We've seen
Leicestershire and Northamptonshire comes up the list, becoming the two most
prosperous counties.'
In social terms, Nottinghamshire's problem has been exacerbated by the
physical concentration of the mines in the north and west of the county,
frequently in villages whose reason to exist has been the pit, where the
winding gear looks down on the estates of redbrick homes. Only Cotgrave has
been in the south of the county.
But the north and west also have concentrations of engineering and textiles
companies. Unemployment has been consistently above the national average and
in Mansfield, the largest town affected, it is more than 16 per cent.
There are two immediate problems. The first is that of re-training redundant
miners and fitting them back into the labour force of Nottinghamshire and
the adjacent counties.
The second is helping existing companies firstly to withstand the financial
problems of emerging from recession and then to expand or strengthen
existing operations.
In the medium and longer term, the growth of the economy is dependent on
diversification, especially in the north and west of the county.
What form this might take is unclear. In the south, around Nottingham, the
process is well-advanced with the growth, for example, of financial services
and the development of the city as an office centre. Once considered as
headquarters for English Heritage the city has been chosen for an Inland
Revenue development.
To help, a battery of services and funds is being made available, although
Martin Gawith, deputy leader of the county council said that their work
'certainly is not as co-ordinated as well as it ought to be or could be'.
Assistance to the county is coming in at three levels. At the local level,
the county council, the training and enterprise councils (Tecs), local
enterprise agencies and British Coal Enterprise are playing a role not only
in the provision of training and job advice services but also in the
provision of venture capital and loans to small companies.
There has been some success in putting redundant miners back to work.
British Coal Enterprise said it had been finding jobs at the rate of about
100 a week. But there is a difficulty. 'Each agency knows what it deals
with. We don't have the capacity between us to say 'OK, we've lost 9,000
jobs since October 1992'. Where are all these people? What are they doing?
Who are they? There's a worry a lot of people are staying at home, who've
got lost, who are very isolated. It's an unknown,' said Pat Richards, chief
executive of the North Nottinghamshire Training and Enterprise Council.
The second level of help comes at the national and regional level. The
government has largely funded East Midlands Development, which will
spearhead the regional drive for inward investment and whose developing
activities are thus watched closely in Nottinghamshire.
The establishment this year of a new government office for the East
Midlands, bringing together all departmental activities, should ease some
co-ordination difficulties. It should prevent the sort of situation where,
for example, the department of transport promises a level of funding for the
Robin Hood railway line, to link Nottingham with Mansfield and Worksop,
which the Treasury finds too high.
At a financial level, there should be funding for the county from the
government's single regeneration budget, depending on the skill of local
private-public sector partnerships in putting bids together. Amounts are
unclear.
However, the government's designation of the north and west as an assisted
area opens up the way for subsidies to companies creating jobs. It also
smooths the way for the authorities in seeking funds from the European Union
for specific projects.
This European funding is the third level of assistance and the
Nottinghamshire Council has calculated that there could be Pounds 65m
available over the next three years.
Growth trends seem linked in the immediate future to industries which are
already established. The arrival in Mansfield of Toray Textiles, the
Japanese group, and the decision by Johnson Controls, the US company, to
make car seat covers in the town offer an immediate boost to the textiles
industry and have opened up the possibility of a new industrial
concentration.
'One company or group of companies can be the focal point around which
others can circulate,' said John Finch, chief executive of East Midlands
Enterprise. But such arrivals are rare and officials observe that the main
stimulus to counteracting the rundown of the coalfield will be a national
economic recovery.
Surveys have shown that in Nottinghamshire, as elsewhere, order books are
fattening and profitability has started to improve. The ground is ready for
economic expansion. That, in its turn is the prerequisite for the sort of
sustained corporate investment which would underpin the shift away from the
historic dependence on the coalfield.

FT  14 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Barclays wanted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, CHRISTOPHER PRICE, CLARE GASCOIGNE and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The strongest performance in the UK banking sector came from Barclays, which
benefited from bouts of switching from a number of other UK banks but
notably from National Westminster. The latter dipped to 453p, mainly
reflecting the switching, but rallied to end unchanged at 459p.
Barclays, however, was well bid all day and settled 3 higher at 549p after
good turnover of 4.7m shares. Sentiment was also driven by Mr Martin Taylor,
Barclays' chief executive who, while on a trip to Japan, delivered a bullish
message on the bank's current and future performance. He said the bank's
profitability was recovering strongly.
Standard Chartered, the FT-SE 100's best performer last week and last month,
following a series of broker buy recommendations and a forthcoming series of
presentations to US institutions, attracted a minor flurry of profit-taking,
closing 9 off at 266p with 17m shares traded.
Two big trades in Standard shares at the close, a block of 9m and another of
5.2m shares, equivalent to 6 per cent of the company's issued capital,
traded at 245p and were thought to have been bed and breakfast, or
tax-related deals.
SG Warburg was a notable weak spot in the merchant banking sector, sliding
11 to 729p, with the market still nervous about the bank's exposure to big
swings in bonds and equities across Europe.
In a recent note, Robert Fleming Securities said: 'Unless market sentiment
turns dramatically, the potential downside to the Warburg share price is
still substantial.'
The broker's merchant banks analyst Mr Rupert Fleming said: 'Warburg's long
term trend of greater reliance on proprietary trading and marketmaking has
implications for valuation; we believe Warburg should be derated towards
premium US investment house ratings of eight times historic earnings,
indicating a price of about 605p.'
An increase in the dividend and a positive results meeting helped traders
discount the 2.4 per cent decline in profits from distribution group
Christian Salvesen, which rose 8 to 255p.
Shares in Channel tunnel operator Eurotunnel gave up 18 to 324p on rumours
that several institutional investors were unwilling to take on the stock
from the group's recent Pounds 816m rights issue.
One market watcher said: 'At this stage, it looks like SG Warburg
(Eurotunnel's broker) will be left holding a large chunk of the issue.' The
offer closes on June 22.
Sentiment in the stock was further damaged by news of a breakdown of a test
train in the tunnel last Saturday, due to an electrical short circuit.
Swiss Bank Corporation issued 5m call warrants in a basket of pharmaceutical
stocks. The basket represents three Glaxo, down 11 to 549 1/2 p, one, 5 1/2
cheaper at 589p, one Zeneca, 12 lower at 694p, and two SmithKline Beecham,
off 3 1/2 at 398p.
Swiss Bank said the underperformance of the sector in the past year,
declining about 12 per cent against the FT-SE Actuaries All-Share Index,
made it attractive.
Conglomerate Williams Holdings hardened 2 to 353p in trade of 1.5m, with
Kleinwort Benson reported to have recommended the stock.
Magazine publisher EMAP slipped 2 to 407p after confirming that it was in
discussions with radio group Trans World Communications for a recommended
offer. Businessman Mr Owen Oyston, who owns 22 per cent of Trans World, has
agreed to sell at 181p a share, a price which was well received by analysts.
Chiltern Radio, which last week became the subject of an agreed bid of 242p
a share from Luxembourg broadcaster CLT, firmed 3 to 243p.
Rationalisation plans by Dixons involving the closure of 100 Currys stores
were confirmed by the group. Although mooted in the market for some time,
the news nevertheless hit the shares, which fell 6 to 187p.
Among food manufacturers, yield considerations held up Hazlewood Foods,
ahead 4 at 131p, and limited the damage to Dalgety, off a penny at 417p.
Details of the well-flagged rights issue from Euro Disney were finally
announced; the seven-for-two issue priced at FFr10 aims to raise FFr5.9bn.
Euro Disney shares dropped 20 on the news but rallied to close just 3 down
at 380p.
Ladbroke shares were in demand, a combination of a rebound after recent
weakness and featuring as part of a large programme trade. The group also
announced the death of finance director and vice-chairman Mr Jerry O'Mahony.
The stock added 2 at 161p in turnover of 5.5m shares.

FT  14 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Lasmo edges up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, CHRISTOPHER PRICE, CLARE GASCOIGNE and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Enterprise Oil/Lasmo bid battle entered another crucial phase, with
Lasmo shares creeping higher and those of Enterprise slipping back as the
market responded to intense speculation in the weekend press that Enterprise
will sweeten the terms of its bid by the end of the week.
Under UK Takeover Panel rules, Enterprise has until the end of this week to
come up with a revised offer.
One oil sector specialist said no counter to the Enterprise bid was likely
to emerge until Enterprise had made a final bid. 'And it is by no means
clear that another potential bidder is sniffing around, despite the heavy
activity in the market late last week,' the analyst added.
Enterprise shares fell 11 to 399p while Lasmo moved up 5 1/2 to 147 1/2 p.
Turnover in Lasmo was 4.7m shares.

FT  14 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Waters find buyers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The utilities sectors accounted for most of the FT-SE 100's best performing
stocks yesterday as institutions focused on the sectors' above-average
yields and dividend potential.
Water shares, which have been left for dead by buoyant rec and generator
areas recently, were the best performers, ahead of results this week from
two of the sector's FT-SE 100 constituents, Severn Trent, due this morning,
and Thames, scheduled for tomorrow.
Both companies are expected to post annual dividend increases of around 8
per cent. Severn Trent was the best individual performer in waters, closing
6 ahead at 526p. Thames edged forward a penny to 481p.
The recs' preliminary results season commences tomorrow with London
Electricity (up 7 at 590p), which is forecast to increase its dividend total
by more than 15 per cent.
Norweb, due to report on June 27, forged ahead 12 to 649p and Northern,
which is reporting on June 29, put on the same amount at 692p.

FT  14 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Renewed bond market weakness hits
shares - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A re-emergence of inflation worries in the US and in Britain hit securities
markets in London yesterday, overshadowing the outcome of the elections for
the European parliament which were not far out of line with expectations.
Although selling pressure on equities was only moderate, the stock market
was undermined by a new round of substantial losses in British government
bonds, themselves hurt by falls in German and US bond prices.
At the low point of the session, the FT-SE 100 Index was more than 45 points
down and within 10 points of the 3,000 mark regained so recently and with
such difficulty. A minor rally was held in check by a sluggish opening on
Wall Street, where the Dow Average put on 7.45 points in UK trading hours.
The final reading showed the FT-SE 100 at 3,016.3 for a drop on the day of
39.6.
Weakness in German bonds and in other European stock markets quickly halted
an attempt by UK equities to extend Friday's advance. The result of UK
voting in the European elections was regarded as negative for the stock
market because it implied further uncertainty for Mr John Major's government
and threatened to weaken its political resolve to resist inflation.
Inflation worry was also rekindled by the input pricing category of the UK
domestic producer price index for May. Markets reacted swiftly to the UK
Treasury comment that the 0.9 per cent increase in input prices had been
'mainly' due to oil and commodity prices.
This reminded analysts that commodity price pressures had been pinpointed as
inflation threats by the US Federal Reserve. Unfortunately, German bond
markets began to extend early losses after a member of the US Federal
Reserve Board referred to 'slight signs' of inflationary pressures in the US
economy.
Inflation worries focused on prospects for the US consumer price statistics,
due around noon today, European time. Some strategists raised their
forecasts for US CPI growth, which had previously been for a rise of around
0.3 per cent.
Concern over inflationary pressure also turned attention to other components
of this week's heavy list of economic data. In Britain, statistics due
tomorrow on retail prices, unemployment and industrial production coincide
with data on average earnings, which will be scanned for signs of wage cost
pressures; tomorrow evening, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor of the
exchequer, will deliver an important speech in the City of London. However,
comments yesterday afternoon from Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, on
UK economic progress had little immediate impact in the stock market.
The reappearance of a discount on the Footsie futures contract reinforced
selling pressures on the blue chip stocks. In the broader market the FT-SE
Mid 250 Index closed 12.7 off at 3,595.8.
Seaq volume of 483.7m shares, although higher than on Friday, was at the low
end of recent daily averages; the focus on the Footsie stocks left the
non-Footsie issues to make up only about 52 per cent of the total. Friday's
Seaq turnover of 416.4m shares was worth a respectable Pounds 1.26bn in
retail business.
The renewed focus on bond markets proved a disappointment for a UK stock
market which last week showed signs of having disengaged itself from the
pressures suffered by fixed interest markets since the commencement of the
year.

FT  14 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Strong US selling, technical trading and the weakness in other European
markets together brought a sharp decline to stock index futures, writes Joel
Kibazo.
In its last week of trading, the June contract on the FT-SE 100 opened at
3,043. However, this was at a 16- point discount to cash, and together with
active selling by a leading US broker, June fell steeply, pulling the
underlying cash market lower.
Attempts at a rally petered out as dealers reflected on the poor performance
in European bond markets and carried out technical trading ahead of the
contract's expiry on Friday.
The tentative start on Wall Street led to a further fall in the June
contract and it touched a day's low of 2,991 at around 3pm when it was
trading at a 24-point discount to cash.
Bargain hunting late in the session helped the contract steady and it closed
at 3,011, down 34 from its previous finish and at a 4-point discount to
cash. Volume, at 18,722 lots, was healthy.
Turnover in traded options was modest, with a mere 22,252 contracts dealt,
against Friday's 38,042. The FT-SE 100 option saw business of 12,190 lots
and the Euro FT-SE option 2,562 contracts. Tarmac was the most active stock
option at 1,025 lots traded, followed by National Power at 901 contracts.

FT  14 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets: Equity Markets
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The implications of the European elections for equity markets will be felt
this week. It was good news for Austria, which also voted at the weekend in
favour of joining the European Union; the Vienna market was the best
performer in local currency terms among the constituents of the FT-Actuaries
World index. The Austrian decision could have a positive short-term effect
for those Scandinavian markets which are due to vote on union this autumn,
although Unibank Securities reports that the 'no' vote campaign continues to
lead polls in both Sweden and Norway.

FT  14 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Strength in cyclicals takes
Dow higher
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
Most US share prices stalled yesterday, but cyclical issues were strong
enough to carry the blue chip index higher, writes Frank McGurty in New
York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 9.67 ahead at 3,783.12, but the
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was only 0.43 better at 459.10. A
moderate 243.6m shares were traded on the New York SE.
A decisive trend also failed to develop in the secondary markets. The
American SE composite edged 0.65 lower to 441.19, while the Nasdaq composite
shed 2.55 to 731.70.
It was yet another session in which many investors preferred to watch and
wait for more clues about the economy. May's consumer price data, to be
released this morning, were generally viewed as unthreatening, but an
unexpected jump in core prices, which exclude the volatile food and energy
sectors, could trip up the market.
With last Friday's producer price data bringing a mild surprise, bond
traders were taking no chances on today's report. Treasury prices were
moderately down, restraining the mood among equity investors. But economists
were attaching more importance to tomorrow's report on industrial
production, business inventories and capacity utilisation.
The data were expected to show the economy continuing to grow at a stable
pace. Such news should have a favourable impact on stocks likely to benefit
from healthy growth.
Yesterday, cyclicals were showing signs of life for a second straight
session after weeks of dormancy. Alcoa advanced Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 75
1/4 , International Paper Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 71 1/4 and DuPont Dollars
1 1/8 to Dollars 61 3/4 .
Offsetting those gains, Exxon dropped Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 59 1/4 after
a federal jury ruled that recklessness by the company and the captain of the
Exxon Valdez had been responsible for the 1989 Alaskan oil spill. The
decision allows plaintiffs to pursue Dollars 15bn in punitive claims.
Elsewhere in Oils, Texaco lost Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 63 5/8 .
In the automobile sector, Ford Motor moved ahead Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 59
in brisk activity, after the company unveiled a reorganisation of its
financial operations. Chrysler was Dollars 1 1/2 stronger at Dollars 48 3/8
.
Cyprus Amax Minerals made a rare appearance on the NYSE's active list. The
stock climbed Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 31 3/8 after the group filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission for a shelf offering of up to Dollars
500m in debt securities and equity.

Toronto stocks displayed an easier tendency in continued light trading,
although the TSE 300 composite index lost just 3.7 points at 4,206.8.
Declines outscored advances by 412 to 288 after volume of 48m shares valued
at CDollars 534.8m. Eleven of the 14 stock groups ended lower, with real
estate falling 1.94 per cent.
Alberta Energy, up CDollars  1/2 at CDollars 21 3/8 , said it will
restructure its forest products assets into a new unit and proceed with an
initial public offering of the unit's shares when market conditions warrant.
It will retain at least a 50 per cent stake in the subsidiary. The company
also said it expects record earnings and cash flow in 1994.

FT  14 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Suez weak on CU deal as Paris
hits 1994 low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Weak bonds, a weak dollar and the threat of excess liquidity due to
corporate cash calls pushed most bourses lower, writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS suffered a sharp correction after the CAC-40 index, failing to find
fresh support after breaking through the 2,000 level, struck a session's low
of 1,969 before ending the day at a new low for the year of 1,977.66, down
43.06.
The main cause of the setback was not the European election results in
France, a disappointment for the ruling right-wing coaliton government, but
continuing weakness in the bond and futures markets. Equity turnover stayed
low at around FFr3.5bn.
Suez eased FFr9.50 to FFr293.50 as investors reacted to the news, announced
after Friday's close, that it was to sell its Groupe Victoire subsidiary to
Commercial Union, of the UK. The sale, believed to be for some FFr12.5bn, is
perceived as disappointing for the French group. James Capel, which said it
was not recommending the stock as a buy, made reference yesterday to the
fact that, by its own calculations, the sale was worth some FFr12bn less
than it was last summer - a difference equivalent to FFr80 per share.
FRANKFURT tried to move up after a satisfactory Euroelection performance
from the CDU, but the attempt foundered under pressure from the pending
Daimler rights issue, and other technical factors which went from bad to
worse as the day wore on.
The Dax index finished the session down 27.30, or 1.3 per cent lower at
2,105.78. Selling ahead of Daimler's near-DM3bn rights issue brought the
stock down DM28, or 3.6 per cent to DM747 and undermined other cyclical blue
chips like BMW, Volkswagen, and BASF.
Turnover rose from DM5.3bn to DM5.8bn. After hours, the Ibis-indicated Dax
fell through support at the 2,100 level, and kept falling until it closed
the afternoon at 2,084.42, its lowest point of the day.
Mr Edgar Benischek, head of trading at Bank Julius Bar in Frankfurt, said
that in addition to the weight of the Daimler issue, the market was
conscious of Friday's upcoming closure of futures and options contracts - an
event which can lead to strong pressure to bring prices up, or down.
The events of the day overshadowed allegations in Der Spiegel which left
Mannesmann down DM2.50 to DM436.50 on the session, and a further DM2 lower
at the end of the London afternoon.
AMSTERDAM's only bright spot came with the first day of trading in KPN, the
post and telecommunications group, which closed at Fl 50.20, a premium to
the issue price of Fl 49.75. Volume was exceptionally heavy with an
estimated 17m shares changing hands.
The flotation of 30 per cent of the KPN equity was the largest in the
market's history, but even this was insufficient to motivate the broader
market which was pressured by weak bonds. The AEX index finished off 5.02 or
1.2 per cent at 401.69; KPN not yet being included among AEX constituents.
Heineken dropped Fl 4.90 to Fl 218.70 in line with the trend and little
affected by news that its Spanish subsidiary, El Aguila, planned a 3-for-10
rights issue.
KLM, off 10 cents at Fl 50.80, denied reports which had come from the
Belgian communications ministry, that it had been holding talks with Sabena
on closer co-operation.
MILAN was unexpectedly weak after the strong showing of Mr Silvio
Berlusconi's Forza Italia party in the European elections. The Comit index
fell 13.90 or 1.8 per cent to 742,33 amid profit-taking, particularly by
foreign investors, after yesterday's options expiry and ahead of tomorrow's
end of the monthly account.
Dealers noted that the market faced heavy calls on liquidity with the with
the privatisation of Ina, the state insurer, and a number of rights issues
during the July account. They added that a constitutional court ruling on
pensions, which could cost the treasury up to L16,000bn, compounded the
negative mood.
Among shares heavily traded by foreign investors, Fiat fell L268 to L6,633,
Generali gave up L950 to L43,600 and Montedison lost L69 to L1,405 in volume
of 27.7m shares.
ZURICH was pulled lower by the banking sector after the Swiss National Bank
warned that it saw no room for easier monetary policy for the time being.
The SMI index dropped 19.6 to 2,744.2 as UBS bearers lost SFr21 to SFr1,206
and SBC bearers SFr8 to SFr406.
Against the trend, Berner Holding, the insurer, picked up SFr50 to SFr1,280
after Germany's Allianz said it had bought a 30 per cent stake.
SMH, under pressure last week, rose SFr17 to SFr840. James Capel, which
lowered its recommendation, commented that a relatively flat profit outlook
for this year, combined with concerns about the durability of the Swatch
brand, would make it difficult for the watchmaker to outperform in the short
term.
MADRID was not inclined to celebrate the triumph of the opposition
conservatives in the European parliamentary elections. Bonds weakened,
equities followed and the general index fell 4.48 to 321.03.
WARSAW accelerated its recent slide, all Polish shares tumbling by the 10
per cent price limit. The Wig index fell 955.4, or 9.8 per cent, to a 1994
low of 8,757.3. Turnover shrank 63 per cent to 374bn zlotys.

FT  14 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei average rallies
to new two-year closing peak

<TEXT>
Buying by foreign investors and domestic institutions supported share
prices, and a late afternoon rally sent the Nikkei 225 average to a new
two-year high, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The index finished 157.63 higher at 21,552.81, its best level since February
1992. It declined to a day's low of 21,271.55 at the beginning of the
session on selling by dealers and profit-taking by institutional investors.
Buying by overseas investors and domestic institutions pushed prices higher
later, absorbing index-linked selling by investment trusts and
profit-taking, and an intraday peak of 21,573.21 was registered just before
the close.
While a further rise in the index would require the participation of
domestic institutions, traders expected the downside to be limited. Although
most institutions had not changed their view over the economy and were not
convinced of an imminent recovery, many were nervous of being left behind in
the current rally, said a UK based broker.
The Topix index of all first section stocks rose 11.93 to 1,712.73, while
the Nikkei 300 added 1.99 at 311.71. Advances led falls by 730 to 286, with
174 issues unchanged.
A total of 162 stocks were at their highs for the year. Volume dropped to
400m shares, from 1.09bn on Friday. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased
0.29 to 1,411.77.
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, the most active issue of the day, put on Y8 at
Y828. It managed to shrug off earlier profit-taking by investors who
regarded the stock as too expensive. Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries
moved ahead Y16 to Y516.
Minebea, the ball bearings manufacturer, fell Y24 to Y900. Speculators and
dealers, who had bought the issue on prospects of higher profits due to
increasing sales of the company's computer keyboards, rushed to take
profits.
Construction companies, regarded as laggards, gained ground on buying by
foreigners, domestic individuals and dealers. Kumagai Gumi rose Y26 to Y538
in heavy trading, while Haseko appreciated Y20 to Y726.
Profit-taking depressed Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, which declined
Y2,000 to Y872,000, and East Japan Railway, which lost Y2,000 to Y513,000.
In Osaka, the OSE average advanced 99.95 to 23,747.18 in volume of 38.8m
shares. The index climbed for the fifth consecutive day on rises in
low-priced issues.
Roundup
Singapore and Kuala Lumpur were subdued after Malaysian election prospects
seemed to fade. Australia, Hong Kong and Taiwan were closed for public
holidays.
SINGAPORE was volatile on a mixture of political news with selective
Japanese buying, ending with the Straits Times Industrial index 11.79 higher
at 2,295.92.
Equities fluctuated after Mr Mahathir Mohammed, the Malaysian prime
minister, told state political leaders not to be disappointed if a general
election was not held soon.
However, they were led higher by an 80-cent rise in Cycle &amp; Carriage, the
motor group, to SDollars 11.60 on Japanese institutional demand.
SEOUL bought early on expectations that the government would soon increase
the ceiling of foreign share ownership. But profit-taking set in after
Finance Ministry officials said the government had no plans to revise its
previously announced schedule.
This process wiped out most of the early gains, the composite index
finishing a net 4.64 ahead at 923.24 after reaching a day's high of 931.67
during the first hour.
KUALA LUMPUR closed well off its highs on heavy afternoon profit-taking,
after the prime minister said that the general election could be held at any
time from now until December 1995.
The composite index ended just 0.95 firmer at 1,017.93 after a morning peak
of 1,033.31.
There were reports that Nomura Securities had launched a new Malaysian fund,
known as the Aurora Fund, which was aiming to raise up to Y300bn.
BANGKOK encountered profit-taking which left the SET index 4.37 lower at
1,379.04 in moderate turnover of Bt7.6bn.
Losses were pared by the firm performance of the property development
sector, spurred by Krisda Mahanakorn, which jumped Bt7 to Bt79.50 in
turnover of Bt603.7m.
The stock rallied after a case of alleged stock manipulation against its
major shareholder Vichai Krisdathanonda was dropped last week.
Shares in Jalaprathan Cement gained Bt4 at Bt131 in turnover of Bt142.6m on
a newspaper report of a planned capital increase.
SHANGHAI's yuan-denominated 'A' shares remained under pressure from a flood
of new issues, a loss of confidence in company managements and robust sales
of treasury bonds.
The index fell 23.42 to a two-year low of 497.79, compared with an historic
peak of 1,640.71 in February 1993.
'B' shares, reserved for foreign investors, have put in a steadier
performance, helped by locals who have enlisted the help of relatives and
other foreigners to buy on their behalf. The 'B' share index dipped 1.49 to
71.13.
MANILA edged lower as the market continued to consolidate, missing the
stimulus of the Hong Kong market. The composite index dipped 1.99 to
2,986.19 in volume that fell to 826.2m shares from the previous session's
1.3bn.
WELLINGTON turned lower after a firm opening, the NZSE-40 Capital index
losing 19.98 to 2,104.03 in subdued trading.
JAKARTA was weaker in lifeless trade, which left the Jardine index 0.15
lower at 101.51.
Ades, a water bottling firm which made its debut, finished at Rp3,650 for a
5.2 per cent decline from its offer price.
COLOMBO edged down, with limited foreign demand leaving the all-share index
7.77 off at 973.73. Turnover fell to SLRs38.6m from Friday's SLRs120m.

Futures-related buying and improved foreign demand helped Johannesburg climb
1.4 per cent, although a volatile gold price and mild profit-taking blunted
the advance.
The overall index added 77 at 5,721, industrials 64 at 6,709 and golds 46,

Argus Newspapers was untraded as it made its market debut: the gap between a
bid price of R10 and sellers appearing at R15 was said to reflect
uncertainty on future performance.

FT  14 JUN 94 / Markets Report: Weak showing by dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
D-Mark strength following Chancellor Helmut Kohl's success in the European
elections on Sunday and dollar weakness caused by fears of rising US
inflation characterised the foreign exchange markets yesterday, writes
Graham Bowley.
The success of Germany's ruling Christian Democratic Union was seen partly
as lifting the political risk that has weighed on the D-Mark, and as a sign
of voter confidence that the domestic economic recovery is gaining strength.
The D-Mark rose against the dollar in early trade. But later comments from
US Federal Reserve Board member Susan Phillips that there were slight signs
of inflationary pressures developing in the US, and remarks by US Treasury
officials about trade negotiations with Japan, further unnerved the markets
and precipitated a dollar slide.
In the UK, the Conservative party's dismal performance in the European
elections had largely been anticipated and had little overall impact on
sterling.
The dollar stabilised in late trading after earlier weakness following
comments by Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US Treasury Secretary.
He said intervention last month showed Washington was not trying to devalue
the dollar to gain access to Japan's markets. 'It is not in our interest to
try to work our way into the market by devaluing the dollar,' he said.
But analysts doubted whether Mr Bentsen's remarks would offset new
scepticism about US inflation. The comments by Ms Phillips, following
adverse producer price data last Friday, provided the catalyst for a more
sombre mood.
Mr Adrian Cunningham, an economist at UBS, said: 'Her comments are in line
with the general US authorities' view that there are risks that inflation
will rise but that it is currently subdued. Nevertheless, the dollar began
to test the downside after her remarks.'
'The slow grind downwards of the dollar against the D-Mark continues,' said
Mr Avinash Persaud of JP Morgan in London. 'The markets have woken up to the
inflation threat posed in recent data and elsewhere. There is scope for one
last final fling downwards until the Federal Reserve tightens and the dollar
stabilises.'
Comments by Mr Robert Rubin, the White House chief economic adviser, further
undermined the dollar. He said the US was not backing away from its
objectives of opening up Japan's markets to more imports and bringing down
its trade surplus.
Mr Robin Marshall, chief economist at Chase Investment Bank, said: 'Kohl's
success and these very unhelpful remarks have given the market an excuse to
test the downside of the dollar.'
Analysts said investors were also cautious ahead of today's US consumer
prices and retail sales data. The US currency closed in London at DM1.65,
down from DM1.6672 on Friday, and at Y103.145 against Y103.915. New York
trading ended with the dollar at DM1.6457 and Y102.80.
The D-Mark's strength followed the German CDU's victory in the European
elections.
'There is a feeling that the worst is over and that the economy will emerge
strongly from the recession,' said Mr Persaud. 'As confidence grows further,
the gains will be maintained and the D-Mark will remain supported.'
But Mr Cunningham said: 'When the market starts to focus on the probability
that the Bundesbank will continue to cut interest rates, we will start to
see the D-Mark giving up some of its gains.'
Yesterday, Bundesbank council member Hans-Jurgen Krupp said he was 'quite
sure' that there would be 'a further cut' in the official repurchase, or
repo, rate in Germany.
The pound was hit by the general strength of the D-Mark and the outcome of
the European elections, although it did find support from the fact that the
Conservative government's performance was not as bad as had initially been
expected.
The British currency largely shrugged off producer price data for May. This
showed a subdued 0.1 per cent rise in output prices in May, but a worryingly
large increase of 0.9 per cent in input prices.
The pound lost just under a pfennig yesterday to finish at DM2.5061 in
London, against DM2.5142 on Friday, and gained around a cent to Dollars
1.5185 from Dollars 1.5080.
In the futures market, the December short sterling contract closed at 93.67
from 93.79, thus discounting short-term interest rates about a percentage
point higher than the present 5.25 per cent by the end of the year.
In the UK money markets, the Bank of England intervened to sell Pounds 401m
of Treasury bills due June 17 at 4 9/16 per cent to 4 per cent after
forecasting a surplus of Pounds 400m. Overnight money traded between 4 5/8
per cent and 3 1/2 per cent.
The French franc was subdued, largely as a result of D-Mark strength but
also due to the poor performance of the ruling Balladur government in the
European elections.
The Italian lira benefited from the success of the Ber-lusconi government in
the elections.

FT  14 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bean rescue planned for Rwanda
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NAIROBI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A tropical agriculture institute based in Cali, Colombia, has begun an
emergency breeding programme for bean seeds to supply Rwandan farmers when
the bloodshed in the central African country stops.
'The war has claimed half a million lives, but famine in war's wake may take
millions more unless local food production can be restored rapidly,' Mr
Gustavo Nores, the director of the International Centre for Tropical
Agriculture (CIAT), said during a visit to Nairobi.
His centre, which runs a gene bank containing 285 Rwandan bean varieties,
plans to multiply 200 tonnes of seeds that will enable farmers to plant a
new crop and restore the genetic diversity of Rwandan beans when peace is
restored.
The resumption of civil war in Rwanda, sparked by the death of President
Juvenal Habyarimana in an air crash eight weeks ago, has displaced millions
of civilians inside the country and caused the exodus of some 400,000
refugees. Aid workers have warned of the danger of impending famine as the
fighting and indiscriminate slaughter of civilians has caused farmers to
abandon their crops.
Beans are the staple food crop for Rwandans, providing 65 per cent of
dietary protein and 32 per cent of their daily calorie intake. Before the
war, CIAT introduced Latin American climbing beans into Rwanda, which
doubled yields in Africa's most densely populated country. With 700 people
per square kilometre and limited farmland, Rwanda needs to increase crop
yields if it is to continue feeding its population.
Agricultural research stations in Uganda, Tanzania, Burundi and Zaire will
also be contributing to CIAT's efforts to provide Rwandan farmers with bean
seeds. The 200 tonnes are expected to supply about one-quarter of the farms
in Rwanda with one kilogramme of seeds each.

FT  14 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indian government red-faced
over sugar crisis - A look at a supply shortage that is being blamed on
'import bungling'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KUNAL BOSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The failure of the Indian food ministry to recognise in time the extent of
shortfall in sugar production in the current season and arrange sufficient
imports has snowballed into a major political crisis for the federal
government.
The opposition parties, which are putting pressure on the government to
institute an independent enquiry into the 'sugar import bungling', will no
doubt take advantage of the issue during assembly elections in the nine
states at the end of the year.
It was known quite early in the season that India would for the second
consecutive year suffer a heavy setback in sugar production. The initial
production estimate of 11m (repeat 11m) tonnes for 1993-94 has been scaled
down to 9.8m tonnes. According to industry officials, however, the season
may end with still lower output.
The current year's production, plus opening stocks of 3.2m tonnes, will
hardly leave any sugar to be carried forward to next season after meeting
the domestic requirement of over 12m tonnes. And as there is negligible
production of sugar in the first two months of the season, India cannot do
without large-scale imports.
The prospect of shortage has led to a sharp increase in the open market
sugar prices. (Under the distribution control mechanism, 60 per cent of the
industry's production is sold in the open market. The balance 40 per cent is
distributed through fair price shops at fixed rates.)
Even then, it was only on March 9 that the government allowed the duty-free
import of sugar. Earlier, however, the government allowed the import of raw
sugar for refining by the local factories for re-export at a minimum value
addition of 7.5 per cent.
In the beginning, the Indian Sugar &amp; General Industry Exim Corporation, the
industry's trading arm, and some private parties were making imports. At a
much later stage, at the intervention of Mr Narasimha Rao, the prime
minister, government trading agencies like the State Trading Corporation and
Minerals &amp; Metals Trading Corporation started making import contracts.
Procrastination by the government about directing its trading agencies to
import sugar has given opposition parties a weapon to use against it. Mr
Kalpnath Rai, the food minister and the opposition's main target, caused a
major surprise when he barred the Food Corporation of India from signing
import contracts for 600,000 tonnes of sugar on the grounds that the agency
lacked experience in trading.
Import contracts made by STC and MMTC are, however, at much higher prices
than the offers FCI received. This is because STC and MMTC had entered the
market later. According to commerce ministry sources, India had so far
signed import contracts for 1.14m tonnes of sugar, including 535,000 tonnes
by STC and MMTC.

FT  14 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Making the most of oil in a
hostile climate - A look at the problems of exploiting reserves around
Kagalyn, Siberia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is a relief to leave Kogalyn. The name of the Siberian oil town - meaning
'a place where men perish' in the local Khanta dialect - is entirely
appropriate; Kogalyn suffers from one of the most hostile climates known to
man.
Built in seemingly interminable swamp land, Kogalyn shivers in temperatures
of minus 55'C in winter and scorches in summer, when swarms of mosquitos
come out to play.
'Mother nature was not kind when she put down oilfields. But Siberia is
still one of the toughest places to work in,' says one western oil man
surveying the distant landscape.
Even so, Soviet central planners decreed more than 20 years ago that the
Tyumen region's oil reserves should be exploited. Kogalyn, a town of 60,000
people, emerged as an important oil production centre.
It is doubtful whether any modern oil company having a nodding acquaintance
with the free market would develop the fields today. Kogalyn's remote
situation means infrastructure costs would likely to outweigh financial
gains. But with the the development costs having already been covered in the
Soviet era it is becoming an attractive proposition to increase the yields
of existing wells and develop adjacent fields.
The task has fallen to Lukoil, Russia's largest oil company, which was
established in 1993 when disparate exploration, refining and marketing
operations were welded together. Lukoil now accounts for 15 per cent of
Russia's oil output. Only Shell, BP and Exxon are bigger in terms of oil
extraction and refining.
The challenges confronting the new company - and the Russian oil industry as
a whole - are immense. Last year oil production in the Tyumen region fell by
16.4 per cent and Lukoil's output slid from 57.1m tonnes to 48.8m. The
company expects a further decline of 5 per cent this year.
Mr Semion Vainshtok, director general of Lukoil's largest production
subsidiary, Kogalymneftegaz, is busy fighting fires on many fronts. But
perhaps the greatest is the change of mentality of the workforce, for whom
cost was a seemingly unknown concept.
'Three hairs on your head are too few. But 3 hairs in your borsch are too
many,' he says, illustrating a need for a change of perspective.
Much attention is being paid to reducing electricity consumption and the
volume of water being pumped into the oil reservoir. Stricter production
guidelines have been introduced. About 1,000 employees have been laid off
and a further 300 are on compulsory leave. Comparable statistics are hard to
come by but Kogalymneftegaz estimates that such measures have already shaved
two to three percentage points off the production cost of a barrel of oil.
Annual savings could run to 60bn roubles, it claims.
Kogalymneftegaz is also trying to raise the yield of existing fields. It is
drawing on the expertise of several western companies. One of them, Calgary
Overseas, a private Canadian group, has already helped to 'work over' 1,000
wells, at an average cost of Dollars 220,000 each.
Mr Robert Lipsett general manager of Calagary Overseas, estimates that those
improvements have helped to raise the output of the nearby Vatyegan Povkh
fields by 10 to 15 per cent.
'The Russian's have very sophisticated technology for the oil and gas
industry but they do not meld it all together to maximise production and
minimise cost,' he says.
The Canadian contingent is steadily declining as the local Russians learn to
co-ordinate such work themselves. Lukoil eventually hopes to transfer its
own skills abroad. In collaboration with Agip of Italy, it has started oil
projects in Tunisia and Egypt.
But many of Lukoil's problems are beyond its control. Financial upheavals in
the Russian economy have resulted in cashflow problems and Lukoil says its
customers owe it 600bn roubles. It is restructuring its finances to ensure
that it has sufficient cash available in its operating companies. 'You
cannot a build an island of well-being in a sea of economic troubles,' says
Mr Vainshtok.
Lukoil has also tangled with the government over taxation issues and export
quotas. The company wants to break free of the state grip and operate as a
wholly-independent privatised company.
The government intends, however, to retain 45 per cent stake in Lukyl for
the next two years and will continue to influence the company's actions.
As a private corporation, however, Lukoil may face a fresh set of
challenges. It is already entangled in a bitter legal dispute with
Frankenburg, a Houston-based oil company, which is claiming more than
Dollars 500m in damages for breach of contract, Lukyl denies the charge.

FT  14 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Aluminium and coffee lead
renewed advance
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Base metals and soft commodities made a bright start to the week with
leading contracts at both the London Metal Exchange and the London Commodity
Exchange registering big gains.
At the LME the pace was set by the aluminium market, which saw the three
months position confirming last week's break above the Dollars 1,400-a-tonne
resistance area. The price closed at Dollars 1,427.25, up Dollars 21, after
reaching a 33-month high of Dollars 1,433 at one time.
Dealers told the Reuters news agency that there was a growing consensus in
the market that aluminium's fundamentals were turning round at last after a
long period during which oversupply had lifted stocks of the metal in LME
registered warehouses to unprecedented levels.
They said the next target on the upside was Dollars 1,460 a tonne, which
could signal the start of a major bull market.
'The tide is turning for aluminium,' said Mr William Adams, research analyst
at London broker Rudolf Wolff. 'As long as smelters do not renege on their
cutback announcements, the fundamentals should continue to improve.'
Aluminium's strength helped the copper market to repeat last week's assault
on resistance at Dollars 2,400 a tonne - and this time it appeared to have
succeeded. Good buying was attracted by an early dip to Dollars 2,380 for
the three months price and, after peaking at Dollars 1,423, it closed
Dollars 27.50 to the good at Dollars 2,411.50. It moved up again in after
hours trading to Dollars 2,420.
But Mr Phillip Crowson, chief economist at RTZ, the world's biggest mining
group, told an analysts' meeting in Paris that copper's current price level
was temporary and would 'see a retreat before 1995'.
Copper supply was now falling short of demand, he said, but in the next few
months cheap Russian exports might resume now that cold weather would no
longer slow output.
At the LCE, meanwhile, the September delivery robusta coffee price surged to
Dollars 2,330 a tonne in an active morning session, adding Dollars 182 to
last week's Dollars 57 advance. It was trimmed back to Dollars 2,290 at the
close.
Traders attributed the fresh surge to Friday's US Department of Agriculture
report predicting lower world green coffee output in 1994-95. The department
said it expected production to total 90.6m bags (60kg each), down 4 per cent
from last season's harvest.
Reuters reported that buying was well spread between traders, commission
houses and speculators, with some investment funds also returning to the
fray.
With coffee's bullish mood firmly re-established some of the enthusiasm
spilled over into the cocoa market, where September delivery futures rose
Pounds 21 to Pounds 1,016 a tonne. 'The funds are looking for value,' said
one trader. 'They seem happy to sit and let the price go up, rather than
liquidate long positions.'
Coffee stocks held by Brazilian co-operatives fell in May to 1.79m bags from
2.16m bags in April, said the National Coffee Council, a growers
organisation, reports Reuters from Rio de Janeiro.

FT  14 JUN 94 / Government Bonds: Poll results help drive prices lower
across Europe

European government bonds took another tumble, pressured by a variety of
political and economic factors. The sell-off was exacerbated by thin cash
market conditions, with most of the action concentrated in the futures
markets. UK bonds suffered particularly heavy losses.
'Investors are still sitting on the sidelines, while the speculative
community is dominating,' said Mr Kit Juckes, international economist at SG
Warburg Securities.
Uncertainty ahead of today's US May consumer price and retail sales data
also kept participants nervous.
Following Friday's short squeeze, many markets started the day on a slightly
firmer tone. However, that quickly gave way to renewed selling when the
results of the weekend's European parliament elections hit many markets.
One of the worst affected was Spain, where the governing Socialist party's
weak showing in the European and Andalusian elections prompted fears of an
early general election. Prime minister Felipe Gonzales' Catalan coalition
partner said it would continue supporting the minority Socialist government,
and rejected the need for a parliamentary vote of confidence.
However, one dealer warned that Mr Gonzales 'will be at the mercy of the
Catalans, which doesn't make for a stable political outlook'.
The September contract of the Spanish government bond future fell 1.62
points to 92.50.
In France, where the anti-European candidates made a strong showing in the
Euro-elections, prices also fell sharply on fears that confidence in the
government's policies aimed at European integration would be undermined. The
September contract of the notional bond future on Matif fell by 1.62 points
to 115.54.
The spread between the higher-yielding French 10-year benchmark bond against
its German counterpart widened to 44 basis points, from 39 basis points on
Friday.
German bonds were steadier, helped by the fact that Chancellor Helmut Kohl
was one of the few European leaders whose government was bolstered by the
elections. Ten-year cash bonds fell less than a point, led largely by the
bund future. The September contract on Liffe broke several key support
levels before closing around 92.25, down 1.18 points.
UK gilts fell about 1 1/2 point, dogged by the ruling Conservative party's
poor showing in the elections. Despite supportive producer price data,
dealers reported continued inflation worries, and are nervously eyeing
Wednesday's raft of data, which includes May retail prices, April average
earnings and May employment.
Moreover, the Bank of England on Friday is expected to announce its next
gilt auction. In the absence of significant investor demand, 'the spectre of
fresh supply is unnerving the market', said a dealer.
The September long gilt futures contract fell by 1 1/2 points to 100 3/32 .
Although prime minister Silvio Berlusconi's party put on a strong
performance in the European elections, Italian 10-year bonds dropped more
than two points on fears that Friday's constitutional court ruling ordering
the government to pay trillions of lire in back pensions would worsen the
deficit position. The September bond future on Liffe fell by 2.08 points to
106.15.
US Treasury bonds retreated amid concern that today's economic data could
reveal an upturn in consumer price inflation.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  7/16 lower
at 86 13/16 , with the yield rising to 7.347 per cent. At the short end, the
two-year note was down  3/32 at 99 31/32 , to yield 5.873 per cent.
The trading week opened quietly, with many investors reluctant to commit
fresh funds to the market until after the Commerce Department released its
May consumer price index early this morning.
Until late last week, analysts had not viewed the report as a potential
obstacle. However, a surprising gain in core producer prices, revealed by
the government on Friday, has raised some trepidation among traders. Some
were concerned that inflation on a consumer level may prove to have been
stronger than expected.
Analysts, however, are generally sticking to their forecasts of a 0.2 per
cent gain in the CPI, and a 0.3 per cent gain in core prices.

FT  14 JUN 94 / International Capital Markets: LSE advises on stock
borrowing practice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The London Stock Exchange has published a guide on stock borrowing and
lending aimed at informing lenders about recommended best practice.
The booklet, developed in conjunction with the Bank of England's stock
borrowing and lending committee, details the exchange's role in regulating
activity. Market participants generally expect a surge in demand for
borrowed equities once the stock exchange abandons its traditional two- and
three-week account settlement period on July 18, and moves to a system of
'rolling settlement'.
Some market-makers fear obtaining securities to cover 'short' positions in
their proprietary trading books will be more difficult, forcing changes in
the way they trade for their own account. There is also concern from
regulators that institutions such as pension schemes which agree to engage
in securities lending may fail to fully understand the risks.

FT  14 JUN 94 / International Bonds: GECC's return to D-Mark sector
brightens dull day
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Renewed downward pressure on European government bond markets restricted the
volume of new issues in the eurobond market yesterday. Among the day's
meagre offerings was GECC's first appearance in the D-Mark sector since
December 1992. It raised DM250m through an issue of five-year eurobonds.
Lead manager SBC Frankfurt said the bonds were mainly targeted at cash-rich
investors in Switzerland and the Benelux region, since the higher yields on
offer in the German domestic bond market limited their appeal to investors
there.
GECC is believed to have swapped the proceeds of the offering into
fixed-rate dollars. The pricing of the bonds, to yield 20 basis points over
the Treuhand's 5 3/4 per cent notes due 1999, was thought to be fair.
However, syndicate managers said the fall in German government bonds caused
some problems during the launch. In the afternoon, the bonds were trading
around 99.70, down from a re-offer price of 99.77, while the spread widened
slightly to just over 21 basis points.
GECC's deal follows a similar offering from Rabobank last Friday, via CS
First Boston, which was also targeted at Swiss retail investors, who face
heavy D-Mark redemptions in the next few months. Rabobank's five-year bonds
were launched at a yield spread of 17 basis points, but were trading at a
spread of 21 basis points yesterday, partly reflecting the market's
weakness.
Argentina is due to launch its widely-expected D-Mark offering today or
tomorrow, via Deutsche Bank. The three-year issue is likely to raise around
DM500m. Syndicate managers involved in the offering reported good demand for
the deal which, they said, was unlikely to be adversely affected by any
further futures-driven weakness in the bund market.
The stream of euroguilder issues continued yesterday with the launch of a Fl
250m offering of nine-year bonds from NIO, the Dutch government-guaranteed
development aid agency. Lead manager Nibstrating Financial Markets said the
unusual maturity partly reflected the over-hang of 10-year paper in the
market.
The bonds, which were priced to yield 20 basis points over the 6 1/4 per
cent Dutch government bond due 2003, were placed mainly with Dutch
investors. When the bonds were freed to trade, the spread widened out
slightly to 22 basis points.
Vaesteraas, Sweden's sixth-largest city and the home of ABB Asea Brown
Boveri, the Swiss-Swedish electrical engineering group, raised Dollars 50m
through an offering of five-year floating rate notes. The discounted margin
on the notes was 26 basis points over Libor at the launch, which narrowed to
25 basis points when the notes were freed to trade.
Lead manager Goldman Sachs said the notes were sold mainly to investors in
Belgium, though there was also some interest from Sweden and the UK. It is
believed the proceeds of the offering were swapped into floating-rate
Swedish kronor.
Standard &amp; Poor's has revised the outlook on its A-plus implied long-term
rating on the Republic of Korea, to negative from positive.
The outlook revision has been prompted by the heightening of tensions on the
Korean peninsula as North Korea refuses to comply with demands for
inspection of its nuclear facilities.

FT  14 JUN 94 / International Capital Markets: Mixed reception for Swiss
move on bonds in yen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Swiss National Bank's announcement that it will allow bond issues
denominated in yen, or linked to yen, to be launched in the Swiss market was
given a mixed reception from bankers yesterday.
The move follows lobbying by the Swiss subsidiaries of several Japanese
securities firms, according to Swiss bankers. Some Japanese companies are
keen to issue equity-linked debt in yen rather than in Swiss francs, to
avoid foreign exchange risk.
By issuing such unlisted bonds in the Swiss market, it is possible to avoid
the stricter rules on documentation and on secondary market trading, which
are enforced in the eurobond market.
Such issues - known as Alpine bonds - are already permitted in US and
Canadian dollars, and Ecus, but the market has been slow to develop.
'The move is driven by borrowers rather than investors,' said one Swiss
banker. 'The question is whether any retail investors will be interested.'
Another banker in Zurich expressed concern that the move could encourage the
Swiss market to be seen as a route for selling second-rate bonds. 'We don't
want to regain the reputation we had in the late 1980s as a junk bond market
with triple-A pricing,' he said.
A SFr100m convertible issue for Hosiden Corporation, which has already
tapped the Swiss market, could be the first of the new genre. The deal would
be redeemable in yen, if the bonds were not converted by maturity.

FT  14 JUN 94 / International Company News: Klockner to buy 'just over 50%'
of group

<TEXT>
Klockner &amp; Co, the German trading company, plans to buy 'just over 50 per
cent' of Computer 2000, a fast-growing German software and hardware
distributor.
The company it had not bought any Computer 2000 shares in the open market
and had no plans to do so, according to a statement yesterday.
The statement followed an announcement of the barest details of the plan
late on Friday after the Computer 2000 share price had risen sharply during
the day.
Klockner said the controlling holding would be purchased from the Colonia
insurance group and a private shareholder, Mr Arend Oetker.
The parties to the deal had agreed not to release any financial details,
although Computer 2000 is worth an estimated DM400m (Dollars 240m) at
current share prices.
Klockner, a trading subsidiary of the Viag conglomerate, said the purchase
marked its entry into a new business sector, although its new subsidiary,
one of the biggest distributors in the European computer industry, would
continue to operate as a free-standing enterprise.
This suggests that Computer 2000 is likely to continue the aggressive
expansion programme which has characterised its progress since it was
founded in 1983.
Computer 2000's long-declared aim has been to generate sales of DM10bn by
the year 2000. Turnover grew 54 per cent last year to DM2.8bn, and rose 40
per cent to DM1.94bn in the first six months of the current year.
The deal is expected to be rubber-stamped at a meeting of the supervisory
board next month and although it has yet to be approved by the federal
cartel office, no objections are expected.

FT  14 JUN 94 / International Company News: Opting for disarray over
confusion - Argentina's pension reforms are proving difficult
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Argentina's private pension system is off to a slow start - and it has not
been helped by bureaucratic disarray and stronger-than-expected resistance
to change by pensions contributors.
The main difficulty has been government regulations limiting the marketing
campaign of the new pension fund management companies to barely two months,
from May 2 until the end of June.
The result has been a blizzard of confusing and sometimes misleading sales
advice by the 21 fund managers competing for a slice of Argentina's monthly
pension cashflow, estimated at between Dollars 200m and Dollars 300m.
Some 5m pensions contributors must eventually choose between remaining in
the state system or joining a private scheme. So far, pension fund managers
report that less than 150,000 have moved into the private sector.
Private pension funds are to be financed by a compulsory 11 per cent levy on
wages. Alternatively, people can decide to remain in the state system.
Although ridden by deficits, inefficiency and allegations of corruption, the
state scheme does offer a guarantee against the bankruptcy and fraud that
have beset Argentina's financial system for decades.
Furthermore, contributors who have chosen the private schemes cannot return
to the state system. This has understandably encouraged potential savers to
wait and see just how private schemes progress before burning their boats
and leaving the state system.
Signs of disarray in the pension fund regulatory agency has further
discouraged people from moving into the private sector. Three senior
officials of the Pension Fund Superintendency have resigned over what they
claim was inadequate policing of private pension marketing campaigns.
Mr Oscar Rabinovich, who resigned as assistant superintendent of the PFS,
says: 'If we are controlling publicity this badly, I do not want to imagine
what is going to happen (later). I am basically in favour of the new
retirement system, but it can only work if the state exercises strong
controls.'
For their part, private pension fund managers complain that the PFS is
excessively rigid and bureaucratic.
President Carlos Menem recently added to the confusion when he revoked a
clause that ordered state-owned Banco de la Nacion Argentina (BNA),
Argentina's biggest bank, to offer dollar-linked pensions in competition
with the private funds.
The clause was the price of the congressional Peronist party's support for
the controversial legislation. However, fund managers say BNA's
dollar-indexed pensions would distort the financial system. Congress is now
working on a new system of state guarantees to be provided by BNA.
Still, some observers hope the planned new pension system can provide the
catalyst for reform within Argentina's rudimentary capital markets.
Mr Ted Truscott, principal of US fund managers Scudder, Stevens &amp; Clark,
says 'the long-range impact of pension funds cannot be underestimated'. He
expects private funds to boost Argentina's low savings ratio, reduce its
reliance on imported capital, and provide borrowers with long term finance.

Foschini, the South African clothing and jewellery retail group, continues
to make progress, increasing attributable income 26 per cent to R129.9m
(Dollars 35.8m) for the year ended March despite a difficult trading
environment, writes Mark Suzman in Johannesburg.
After tax, profits rose by 39 per cent to R143.7m, but were diluted by an
extraordinary item of R13.8m, largely related to goodwill and trademark
costs following an acquisition. Turnover increased 24 per cent to R1.44bn.
Mr Clive Hirschsohn, managing director, said: 'We used aggressive marketing
to maximise trading opportunities and were well positioned for the first
tentative movements of the economic upswing.'
He said turnover had been boosted by an exceptional second half. The company
controls Oceana Investments, which has a 36 per cent stake in Etam, the UK
retailer.

<TEXT>
Mr Leif Klevan, managing director of state-owned Fokus Bank, Norway's
third-largest commercial bank, yesterday resigned following revelations of
alleged irregularities connected to the disposal of a property shareholding.
Mr Klevan has led Fokus through a successful restructuring, in which the
bank has been cut back to a regional operation serving mid-Norway from a
loss-making operation with branches throughout the country.
His resignation follows reports in which it emerged that Fokus Eiendom, the
bank's property unit which is chaired by Mr Klevan, allegedly sold a 37 per
cent stake in a shopping centre in southern Norway, at cost, to close
acquaintances of the bank.
The report, published last week in Norway, claimed that the buyers of the
Farmandstredet shopping centre stood to make a gain of up to NKr20m (Dollars
2.8m) on a re-sale of the property.
The board of Fokus held an emergency meeting at the weekend and yesterday
announced Mr Klevan's resignation.
While the board did not specifically confirm that Mr Klevan had full
knowledge of the affair, it said greater caution should have been exercised
over the unit's 'informal talks' with the buyers of the Farmandstredet
shareholding, and that Mr Klevan should have been sufficiently informed
about the disposal.
The board has appointed Mr Bjarne Borgersen, an executive with Fokus Bank,
as Mr Klevan's interim replacement until a permanent appointment is made.
Christiania Bank, Norway's second-largest commercial bank, has entered
negotiations to acquire Vestenfjeldeske Bykreditt, a mortgage institution
with assets of NKr7.4bn.
The parties hope to conclude the discussions as soon as possible,
Christiania said. With the mortgage company's preference shares trading at
NKr113 each, it has a market value of around NKr320m.
Christiania said negotiations with the Vestenfjeldeske's board were
continuing but that it had not yet made an offer for the company.

FT  14 JUN 94 / International Company News: Long march to openness for Citic
 -Chinese group gives only sketchy details of profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The China International Trust and Investment Corporation (Citic) this month
reported a massive increase in profits, in percentage terms, for 1993, to
Yn3.35bn (UDollars 390m), but its annual report provided only sketchy
details of how it achieved this seemingly impressive performance leap.
While Citic, which is involved in an extensive range of businesses from real
estate to manufacturing, is becoming more international, and more open in
divulging information about its activities, it still has some way to go to
match world standards.
Not only is Citic, which is owned 100 per cent by the Chinese government,
the parent of increasingly active businesses abroad, including the Hong
Kong-listed Citic Pacific; it is also a substantial borrower
internationally, having raised Dollars 2bn in 18 bond issues by the end of
1993. This included Dollars 250m in 10-year bonds issued last year in the US
market - China's first foray into the US capital markets since 1949.
Citic paper has received a generally good reception in international markets
because bankers assume the conglomerate, which is one of the
standard-bearers of China's socialist-market reforms, carries the full
backing of the Chinese government.
In Beijing, a European bank spokesman said Citic had 'developed a very good
image,' and was now engaged in 'an incredible range of activities.'
But when it came to assessing the quality of its assets it was difficult to
make judgments. 'When examining the balance sheet you don't really know what
you have in front of you,' he said.
Citic lists total assets of Yn82.86bn, but provides little detail. The
company is heavily involved in real estate, for example, but beyond a
sketchy reference in its annual report to the 'strong momentum' of Citic's
real estate business, information is sparse.
Bankers cite as an example of the difficulties assessing details of Citic's
activities the case several years ago of losses incurred in the Bank of
Credit and Commerce International fiasco. Citic may have lost as much as
Dollars 100m - Citic officials say it was much less - but no reference ever
appeared to that episode in its balance sheet.
Similarly, only glancing mention is made in Citic's annual report of a
manufacturing venture in Shaanxi province with some 20,000 employees which
is proving difficult to rehabilitate and is therefore a drain on resources.
Citic's charter requires it to play a role in transforming state-owned
enterprises. The Shaanxi project, involving conversion of a defence factory
to civilian use, was undertaken for political rather than commercial
reasons, as Citic officials ruefully admit.
In the past year, when reported profits were 882 per cent higher, Citic has
also taken over Luoyang Mining Machinery Plant, which has 20,000 employees,
with the aim of revitalising another flagging state-owned enterprise. Citic
officials say that the Luoyang enterprise, re-named the Citic Heavy
Machinery Company, will be, for the time being, the last of such burdens
assumed from the state.
But this does not mean that Citic - including both its mainland activities,
which account for about two-thirds of the conglomerate's business, and its
growing investments abroad - is about to enter a consolidation phase.
As Mr Wei Mingyi, Citic's chairman, told the Financial Times last year: 'If
a company constrains itself by consolidating at a certain level, then I
think that company wouldn't have a future. Business is always aggressive:
maybe sometimes you win, sometimes you fail.'
Citic Pacifc, the Hong Kong listed arm of Citic Hong Kong (Holdings), is an
example of this aggressive strategy, with a fast-growing portfolio of
investments in telecommunications, aviation, property and finance in Hong
Kong.
The company is also becoming active on the mainland with recent acquisitions
in the Wuxi area, west of Shanghai. These have included a steel plant, a
telecommunications cable factory and a precision metal piping plant -
investments totalling about Dollars 100m.
Citic Australia is similarly engaged in rapid expansion. Building on its
1986 investment in an aluminium smelter west of Melbourne, it recently
acquired a meat processing company in Australia; purchased 10 per cent of
Yaohan International, a Japanese retailer; established a trading company in
Singapore; and late last year listed an investment company, CH China
Investment, in Australia.
At home, Citic's main priority, according Mr Yao Jinrong, a vice-president,
is the development of Daxie Island off the coast of Zhejiang province, south
of Shanghai. Citic plans to spend Yn4bn with additional investment of Yn40bn
in developing a deep-water port and economic development zone.
One of Daxie's main functions would be to provide an outlet for China's
land-locked south-western provinces, including Guizhou and Yunnan.
Citic is also involved in a consultancy business, power development,
telecommunications (including the manufacture of pagers), cable television,
finance and trading. All this is placing substantial demands on its
management capabilities.
Vice-president Mr Yao is not exaggerating when he describes Citic as a 'very
important financial institution'. With its high level connections  - its
founder, Mr Rong Yiren, is now China's vice-president - the company is
keenly sought as a mainland partner by foreign investors. 'They are still a
name-card which opens a lot of doors in China,' said a western businessman.
As Citic's business expands, however, and its demand for capital continues
to grow, bankers seem certain to demand greater accountability, but as the
European banker said: 'They will only be as good as the country itself.'

FT  14 JUN 94 / International Company News: Tajudin in fresh attempt to take
over MAS
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KUALA LUMPUR
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tajudin Ramli, a leading Malaysian entrepreneur, has announced a
controversial proposal to take over Malaysian Airlines (MAS), one of Asia's
biggest carriers.
The highly-leveraged deal would see Mr Tajudin take a controlling 32 per
cent stake in MAS for MDollars 1.79bn (USDollars 716m).
The proposal is subject to approval by Malaysia's regulators.
Mr Tajudin has talked of a shake-up at troubled MAS, with airline analysts
predicting that lossmaking domestic services would be sold off.
'In order for Malaysia Airlines to move forward, we would need to develop a
new vision to support our long-term objectives and strategies, taking into
account the company's strengths and weaknesses,' said Mr Tajudin.
'It could even involve an entire re-positioning exercise for the national
carrier,' he added.
In spite of Mr Tajudin's confident talk, a number of questions surround the
deal.
At the end of last year Bank Negara, Malaysia's central bank, announced that
it would sell a 32 per cent stake in MAS to Malaysian Helicopter Services
(MHS), a small listed company controlled by Mr Tajudin.
However, that deal foundered when the rally in the Kuala Lumpur stock market
lost momentum earlier this year.
The original purchase, based on an MAS share price of MDollars 8, was to
have been funded through issuing 112m new MHS shares at the then market
price of MDollars 16 a share.
MAS shares have recently been trading at around MDollars 5, while MHS has
been hovering around MDollars 8.
The new deal sees RZ Equities, an unlisted company owned by Mr Tajudin,
paying Bank Negara the MDollars 1.79bn in cash through a personal loan
financed by Mr Tajudin.
An MHS statement said Mr Tajudin had given MHS the option to acquire 100 per
cent of the equity in RZ.
No details have been given about how Mr Tajudin has raised such a large
loan. Questions have also been raised as to why Mr Tajudin's purchase of the
MAS stock is still based on a price of MDollars 8 a share.
'Financially, the deal seems to make little sense,' said one airline
industry analyst. 'But perhaps Tajudin feels carrying such a debt burden is
worthwhile in order to make changes at MAS and secure long-term profits.'
There are also thought to be political considerations in the deal.
Mr Tajudin is a close business associate of Mr Daim Zainnudin, Malaysia's
former finance minister and a close confidant of Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the
prime minister. Mr Daim is known as one of Malaysia's wealthiest
businessmen.
There is speculation that Mr Tajudin has agreed to the deal in expectation
of one of his companies being given a lucrative government contract.
Over the past three years MAS has been suffered some financial turbulence.
Pre-tax profits for the year ending March 31 1994, at MDollars 16.1m, were
90 per cent down on the previous year.
An ambitious expansion programme involving the purchase of 72 aircraft
valued at MDollars 10.6bn in the 1991-96 period has strained financial
resources.
Mr Tajudin's flagship company is the listed Technology Resources (TRI), a
fast-growing cellular communications concern.
Mr Tajudin also has a controlling stake in a private company which has
launched two Russian communications satellites with the idea of leasing
space to regional users.

FT  14 JUN 94 / International Company News: Saudi bank plans to double its
capital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CAIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Saudi Investment Bank, the kingdom's smallest by capitalisation, plans to
double its capital to SR180m (Dollars 48.6m) through a one-for-one offer of
900,000 shares to shareholders. The share transfer will be paid for by a
SR90m transfer from reserves.
The transfer will keep SIB's shareholding structure. The bank is more than
40 per cent owned by Saudi private shareholders, with the remainder being
held by local and international banks, including Chase Manhattan (which has
15 per cent), Industrial Bank of Japan and J. Henry Schroder Wagg.
The bank said the planned capital increase, which is to be put to a
shareholders' meeting in Riyadh on July 11, would 'give some psychological
feeling to our customers and correspondents' and 'bring our capital closer
to that of our peers', but not alter the bank's strategy.
'We are going to continue on our strategy to be a quality corporate bank for
the kingdom, catering for sophisticated business clients,' it added.
SIB, which has only 10 branches in the kingdom, has always seen itself as a
'boutique' corporate lender, with a strong emphasis also on private banking
as a leading broker in Saudi Arabia's stock market. Banks monopolise direct
brokerage in the kingdom's Dollars 50bn-capitalised stock market, which is
closed to foreign investors.
SIB's recapitalisation will not affect its position as one of the kingdom's
smallest banks. It is among the last of the kingdom's 11 listed commercial
banks to recapitalise over the past few years, during which most banks have
taken advantage of the post Gulf war stock market boom to issue new stock.

<TEXT>
Thailand's largest refiner, Thai Oil, plans to seek a listing on the stock
exchange of Thailand early next year. It wants to float 25 per cent of its
equity capital, write William Barnes and Reuter in Bangkok.
The company, which is partly state-owned, will soon become a public limited
company, after a six-year wait for government approval. Its new status will
be a first step towards a stock exchange listing. If the 74m shares were
sold at the expected price of Bt40, the float would raise some Bt3bn
(Dollars 119m), which would be used to reduce debt and expand refinery
operations.
Thai Oil had net profits of Bt361m in the year ended September 30 1993.
Assets at May 31 this year were Bt47.7bn, while liabilities were Bt38bn.
The National Energy Policy Committee agreed in May that the state-owned
Petroleum Authority of Thailand could retain its 49 per cent stake in Thai
Oil if it persuaded its partners to reduce their holdings; without their
co-operation, the state group would see its share diluted to 37 per cent.

FT  14 JUN 94 / International Company News: Foreign investors favour Cemig -
Brazilian electricity group attracts interest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK MCCURRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Brazil's Cemig, Latin America's biggest electricity company in geographical
terms, has become a favourite of foreign investors.
They have been attracted by Cemig's productivity gains, its low debt and the
potential privatisation of Brazil's electricity sector.
However, Cemig's prices are among the lowest in Brazil, raising questions
about whether the company can raise profitability in the long term.
Cemig, or Companhia Energetica de Minas Gerais, is controlled by the state
of Minas Gerais, which owns 84 per cent of its voting shares and 57 per cent
of its total capital.
The company was created in 1952 by Mr Juscelino Kubitschek, the modernising
state governor and future president, as a generator, transmitter and
distributor.
The state has used the company, covering an area larger than France, to gain
access to international capital markets. In January, the state sold Dollars
200m of eurobonds with equity warrants in the company and it is now planning
a private placement of non-voting American depositary receipts for at least
Dollars 150m.
Overseas interest was stimulated by a Level 1 ADR programme launched last
year, and the company is adapting its accounts to US standards for a
possible capital issue of Level 3 ADRs next year. Currently, about 12 per
cent of Cemig's capital is held by foreigners, compared with almost nothing
three years ago.
Cemig has proved attractive to international investors in spite of an
operating loss of Dollars 165m last year following combined operating losses
of nearly Dollars 200m in 1991 and 1992.
Cemig blames the losses on the government's policy of keeping electricity
prices artificially low to try to control Brazil's inflation. It also says a
change in accounting policy in 1990, adopted by most of the industry, led to
an increase of about 60 per cent in depreciation.
However, a new electricity price structure introduced ahead of the real,
Brazil's new currency due to enter circulation in July, will lead to a
one-off 20 per cent increase in prices for the company, according to Mr Luiz
Fernando Rolla, a Cemig finance official.
Mr Rolla predicts the price increase will help the company to make a small
profit this year. He says investors have been attracted by its low debt, its
reputation for being well managed and prospects for a long-term increase in
demand in Minas Gerais state.
Another attraction has been the prospect of privatisation, leading to price
increases over the longer term.
The government is said to be looking at the industry's privatisation but no
clear decision is expected until after presidential elections at the end of
the year.
Cemig's total debt is only 9 per cent of shareholders' capital, partly
because of under-investment, particularly since the early 1980s when many
publicly-controlled companies were starved of funds.
The company has also avoided the highly expensive local debt market and
sought funds from agencies like such as the World Bank.
Productivity has grown in the past three years, helped by 1,000 job cuts,
reducing the payroll to 17,000. Another 4,000 to 5,000 jobs could go by the
year 2000, says company president Mr Carlos Aloy.
Cemig's ability to cut costs is limited, however, because it is obliged by
the federal government to buy 17 per cent of the energy from the Itaipu
hydroelectric plant on the Brazil-Paraguay border.
This amounts to 28 per cent of Cemig's energy needs, but 34 per cent of its
operating costs.
But a more important problem, according to analysts, is that about 70 per
cent of Cemig's revenues comes from industrial users, which traditionally
pay lower prices than residential users.

FT  14 JUN 94 / International Company News: Court rules on AMD dispute with
Intel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US Supreme Court has denied an appeal by Advanced Micro Devices, the
Silicon Valley semiconductor manufacturer, clearing the way for Intel to
proceed with a microprocessor copyright infringement suit against AMD.
The two Silicon Valley semiconductor manufacturers said, however, that the
Supreme Court decision would have little practical effect, because this
aspect of their long-running intellectual property rights disputes has been
overtaken by other court decisions.
Intel is the world's largest manufacturer of semiconductors and dominates
the market for microprocessor chips used in personal computers.
AMD claims to have rights to Intel intellectual property through agreements
between the companies and as a result of decisions made by an arbitrator and
the courts. Intel's federal court appeal relates to a copyright infringement
case that it filed against AMD in 1991.
While that appeal may now go forward, most aspects of the case have already
been decided in AMD's favour.
'For all practical purposes, the Supreme Court decision is of no meaning,'
said AMD. The decision 'doesn't change anything, but reaffirms our rights to
move forward on outstanding issues,' said Intel.
The companies are meanwhile awaiting decisions in another case, before a
federal court in San Jose, which could decide the time limits on AMD's
rights to use Intel intellectual property.

Smaller west European aluminium companies will be increasingly squeezed by
east European rivals and global operators in their own market, said Mr Berry
Bemelmans, president of Alcoa Nederland, Reuter reports from Drunen, the
Netherlands.
Mr Bemelmans said that companies needed to establish a significant presence
in the key packaging, aerospace or transportation aluminium sectors to
ensure their survival.
A further challenge would come as Russian producers moved from exports of
ingots and extrusions to products with greater added value.
Mr Bemelmans said Alcoa Nederland, through its ownership by Aluminum Company
of America, was the first western company to establish a significant
presence in the east European aluminium market.

National Semiconductor reported record sales and earnings for its fourth
quarter and the full year to May 29.
The Silicon Valley semiconductor manufacturer has completed a three-year
restructuring plan and is poised for growth, it said.
Fourth-quarter net income was Dollars 82.4m, or 63 cents a share before
preferred dividends, on sales of Dollars 609m. This compares with net income
of Dollars 46.2m, or 35 cents a share, on sales of Dollars 558m last year.
After payment of preferred share dividends, earnings per common share were
58 cents, against 33 cents last year.
For the full year, National reported record net income of Dollars 264m, or
Dollars 2.02 a share, more than double fiscal 1993's Dollars 130.3m, or 98
cents. After preferred dividends, earnings per share were Dollars 1.87
(preferred dividends were not applicable in fiscal 1993). Sales for the year
were Dollars 2.3bn, up from Dollars 2.0bn.
Increased sales and earnings reflect 'continuing progress in realigning our
product mix, particularly in our analog and mixed-signal businesses,' said
Mr Gil Amelio, president and chief executive. About 37 per cent of
National's business is in analog chips, which process 'real world' signals
such as sound, rather than the digital signals of the computer world.
'Strong market conditions throughout the industry also helped drive
profitability over the fiscal year,' said Mr Amelio. During the year, the
company completed the consolidation of its manufacturing operations, which
began in 1992, and invested Dollars 271m in new facilities.
'We entered our new fiscal year with a strong (order) backlog, and as a
result we foresee a milder seasonal dip in billings than normally
experienced in the summer months,' said Mr Amelio.
'We expect to see continued improvement in gross margin throughout the year
as we continue to focus on our recently defined strategic market segments,
utilising our technologies for moving and shaping information,' he added.

<TEXT>
RH Macy, the US stores group, has been informed that the attorney general of
New York state has started a formal investigation of the possible
acquisition of Macy by Federated Departments Stores, AP-DJ reports from New
York.
Macy has been in Chapter 11 bankruptcy court proceedings since January 1992.
A spokesman for Macy confirmed that the investigation by the office of
Attorney General G. Oliver Koppell centred on whether a Macy-Federated
merger had anti-trust ramifications.
Macy said it was asked by the attorney general's office to provide detailed
information relating to 'a number of aspects of Macy's business and the
competitive environment in its markets as it relates to Federated, as well
as to other competitors'.
The company said that it planned to co-operate with the attorney general
office's request.
Federated Depatment Stores has been pursuing Macy since January, when the
Cincinnati-based retailer disclosed that it had bought a large amount of
Macy debt.

<TEXT>
Echo Bay Mines is searching aggressively for new gold mines in Latin America
and elsewhere in order to speed growth and offset North America's costly
processes for permits, according to Mr Richard Kraus, president.
The Canadian company has been working for seven years to develop two gold
properties near Juneau, Alaska, and now believes it can bring them into
production in 1998. Total capital costs would be about USDollars 370m to
Echo Bay and annual output about 500,000 oz.
Echo Bay's 1993 output from producing mines in Canada, Nevada and Washington
state was 874,000 oz of gold, up 14 per cent from 1992, and 12.5m oz of
silver, up 57 per cent.
Mr Kraus said the offshore search was being targeted at Ecuador, Peru and
Chile. Reports of a joint venture in China, however, were premature.
Total exploration spending this year will be USDollars 36m. This includes
Dollars 1m for geophysical work and drilling for kimberlite on land Echo Bay
holds near the Lac des Gras diamond deposits in Canada's Northwest
Territories.
'Our properties sit in the Corridor of Hope, running about 200 miles from
Lac des Gras northwest to our Lupin gold mine,' Mr Kraus said. 'We would
raise the budget if we were successful, but for development we'd seek a
partnership with a major international mining firm with diamond experience.'

   PARIS, DALLAS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Part of the capital of SGS-Thomson, the Franco-Italian semiconductor
manufacturer, could be floated on the stock market in the near future,
according to one of its largest shareholders.
CEA Industrie, the French atomic energy commission which holds about 12 per
cent of the shares in SGS-Thomson, said a partial flotation of the
semiconductor group was being discussed with other shareholders.
These include France Telecom, Thomson-CSF, the state-owned electronics
group, and Italy's Finmeccanica and Iri, the state holding company.
CEA said no decisions have been taken on the the timing of a possible
partial flotation nor on the method.
Industry observers in Paris said, however, that it would either take place
as part of a capital increase for the semiconductor manufacturer or through
the sale of shares by existing investors.
The operation could take place by the end of this year or at the beginning
of 1995, according to one industry source.
The discussion of plans for a partial privatisation coincide with an
improved performance at the group which was created in 1987 through the
merger of the semiconductor activities of Thomson of France and SGS
Microelettronica of Italy.
Last year, the group reported net profits of Dollars 160m, compared with
Dollars 3.4m in 1992. Further improvement is expected this year, despite
expectations of a slowdown in the international semiconductor market.
Texas Instruments, a leading US electronics group, has introduced a set of
computer chips to produce VHS-quality video and compact disc-quality sound
for emerging video-CD applications, including movie and music video
playback, video games and karaoke, AP-DJ reports from Dallas.
The company said the chips would be available for sampling this summer.
Production quantities should be available during the fourth quarter.

FT  14 JUN 94 / International Company News: Foreign investors favour Cemig -
Brazilian electricity group attracts interest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK MCCURRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Brazil's Cemig, Latin America's biggest electricity company in geographical
terms, has become a favourite of foreign investors.
They have been attracted by Cemig's productivity gains, its low debt and the
potential privatisation of Brazil's electricity sector.
However, Cemig's prices are among the lowest in Brazil, raising questions
about whether the company can raise profitability in the long term.
Cemig, or Companhia Energetica de Minas Gerais, is controlled by the state
of Minas Gerais, which owns 84 per cent of its voting shares and 57 per cent
of its total capital.
The company was created in 1952 by Mr Juscelino Kubitschek, the modernising
state governor and future president, as a generator, transmitter and
distributor.
The state has used the company, covering an area larger than France, to gain
access to international capital markets. In January, the state sold Dollars
200m of eurobonds with equity warrants in the company and it is now planning
a private placement of non-voting American depositary receipts (ADRs) for at
least Dollars 150m.
Overseas interest was stimulated by a Level 1 ADR programme launched last
year, and the company is adapting its accounts to US standards for a
possible capital issue of Level 3 ADRs next year.
Currently, about 12 per cent of Cemig's capital is held by foreigners,
compared with almost nothing three years ago.
Cemig has proved attractive to international investors in spite of an
operating loss of Dollars 165m last year following combined operating losses
of nearly Dollars 200m in 1991 and 1992.
Cemig blames the losses on the government's policy of keeping electricity
prices artificially low to try to control Brazil's chronic inflation.
It also says a change in accounting policy in 1990, adopted by most of the
industry, led to an increase of about 60 per cent in depreciation costs.
However, a new electricity price structure introduced ahead of the real,
Brazil's new currency due to enter circulation in July, will lead to a
one-off 20 per cent increase in prices for the company, according to Mr Luiz
Fernando Rolla, a Cemig finance official.
Mr Rolla predicts the price increase will help the company to make a small
profit this year. He says investors have been attracted by its low debt, its
reputation for being well managed and prospects for a long-term increase in
demand in Minas Gerais state.
Another attraction has been the prospect of privatisation, leading to price
increases over the longer term.
The government is said to be looking at the industry's privatisation but no
clear decision is expected until after presidential elections at the end of
the year.
Cemig's total debt is only 9 per cent of shareholders' capital, partly
because of under-investment, particularly since the early 1980s when many
publicly-controlled companies were starved of funds.
The company has also avoided the highly expensive local debt market and
sought funds from agencies such as the World Bank.
Productivity has grown in the past three years, helped by 1,000 job cuts,
reducing the payroll to 17,000. Another 4,000 to 5,000 jobs could go by the
year 2000, says company president Mr Carlos Aloy.
Cemig's ability to cut costs is limited, however, because it is obliged by
the federal government to buy 17 per cent of the energy from the Itaipu
hydroelectric plant on the Brazil-Paraguay border.
This amounts to 28 per cent of Cemig's energy needs, but 34 per cent of its
operating costs.
But a more important problem, according to analysts, is that about 70 per
cent of Cemig's revenues comes from industrial users, which traditionally
pay lower prices than residential users.
This means Cemig's prices are on average the lowest in Brazil, according to
Mr Antonio Zagatto, planning manager at Sao Paulo's electricity company
Cesp, where industrial customers make up about 50 per cent of revenues.
Many of Cemig's industrial consumers are in electricity-intensive sectors,
such as aluminium production, which have won large discounts from the
company.
There is also a question mark over Cemig's capital investment.
Mr Luiz Henrique Michalick, company spokesman, says Cemig should be
investing about Dollars 450m a year, instead of the current Dollars 300m, to
cover depreciation costs and prepare for increased demand.
He points to proposed generating partnerships with large consumers, such as
the mining company Companhia Vale do Rio Doce (CVRD), as a way of increasing
electricity supply in the long term using shared capital investment.
Mr Aloy highlights the need for 'maximum partnerships with the private
sector'.
However, he adds that when a new plant in the western area of Nova Ponte
comes into operation later this year, Cemig will have sufficient capacity to
cope with current demand, even without energy from Itaipu.

The Lupin underground mine has pared costs and has at least another 10 years
of life, said Mr Kraus.
He said the big McCoy/Cove mine in Nevada would slow silver production this
year to about 9m oz. It is one of the world's three largest silver producers
as well as providing gold.
Echo Bay, which is Canadian-based but is operated from Denver, Colorado, has
more than Dollars 250m in cash and low debt and expects to finance its
medium-term programmes internally. Last year it earned Dollars 3.6m, or 3
cents a share, on revenues of Dollars 366m.

FT  14 JUN 94 / International Company News: Shareholders in Mediobanca clear
way for cash call
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Shareholders in Mediobanca, the powerful Italian merchant bank, yesterday
cleared the way for a rights issue which will raise at least L1,500bn
(Dollars 932m) to expand the bank's investment portfolio and broaden its
ownership.
Bank directors refused to take questions from investors at yesterday's
meeting on the continuing investigation by Ravenna magistrates into
allegations that senior bank executives were involved in reporting false
1992 accounts for the troubled Ferruzzi-Montedison industrial group.
The allegations, which Mediobanca denies, have cast a shadow over
preparations for the rights issue.
Although a price for the new shares is unlikely to be set until next week,
Mediobanca says the first tranche of 100m shares will be sold for at least
L15,000 each.
Warrants will give the right to buy up to 10m further shares for at least
L15,500 each.
Yesterday Mediobanca shares, which had recovered in recent trading, slipped
back 4 per cent to close at L15,229.
Mediobanca masterminded the restructuring of Ferruzzi-Montedison last year,
after it came near to collapse.
However, the meeting was dominated by discussion of ordinary bank
operations, despite attempts by some of the 111 shareholders present to
raise the subject of the judicial inquiry.
The bank revealed, for example, that it had increased its stake in Paribas,
the French bank, from 1.5 per cent to 2 per cent, at a cost of some L91bn.
Mr Vincenzo Maranghi, managing director, also said gross operating profit
had slipped by some 6.5 per cent in the first 11 months of the current
financial year, which ends on June 30. However, the after-tax result is
likely to be bolstered by such items as underwriting fees.
In 1992-93, Mediobanca's net profits were L200.1bn, down on the previous
year.
The rights issue is partly intended to dilute the 50 per cent holding of the
bank's traditional long-term shareholders - headed by former state-owned
banks and including a roll-call of Italy's biggest and oldest companies - to
about 40.6 per cent.

FT  14 JUN 94 / International Company News: Kemira net income down in first
four months
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Kemira said yesterday that net income after taxes fell to FM215.6m (Dollars
38.97m) in the first four months, from FM237.6m in the same 1993 period.
Sales were 9.7 per cent lower at FM4.19bn while operating income declined to
FM404.1m from FM504.7m.
The figures were prepared using international accounting standards for the
first time.
The group was more positive about prospects, saying results in the second
four months should be better than last year. The group's main division,
Kemira Agro, is expected to benefit from higher capacity utilisation and
declining imports from eastern Europe, while higher titanium dioxide prices
will lift the pigments division.
Figures were hit by a strengthening Finnish markka, sales of non-core
businesses and reduced agrochemical sales to Russia, Ukraine and Belorussia,
the group said. The Agro division was also hurt by poor weather conditions
which delayed demand for plant nutrients.
Operating income was lower in both the Agro and pigments divisions, but
there was a better performance from the chemicals and paints activities.
Pre-tax profits amounted to FM214.6m, compared with FM238.4m a year ago,
after a steep fall in financing costs to FM189.5m from FM266.3m.

</HEADLINE>

   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The French and German state telecommunications operators are set to announce
an enlargement of their international alliance today, which is believed
likely to include a co-operation agreement with the US operator Sprint.
Sprint, the third largest US long distance telecoms carrier, has been in
negotiations with France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom since the spring about
an alliance geared to the international business telecommunications market.
The talks have extended to the terms on which the French and German carriers
might inject capital into Sprint, in return for its co-operation in the
development of joint international telecoms services for multinational
companies.
France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom formed an Ecu1bn (Dollars 1.16bn)
alliance last December geared to integrating their international data
telecommunications networks. In September the two state-owned operators
launched a joint venture - Eunetcom - to exploit the international
'outsourcing' market, estimated by analysts to be worth about Dollars 1bn a
year.
The Franco-German link-up, which has still to be sanctioned by the European
Commission, followed the signing of a Dollars 5.3bn deal between British
Telecommunications and MCI, the second largest US carrier, last June.
The state operators of Switzerland, Sweden and the Netherlands also have a
joint venture, called Unisource, aimed at the international telecoms market.
Unisource has been in talks with AT&amp;T, the largest US carrier.
Executives of the French and German operators have been seeking a US partner
for their international activities for more than a year.

intensifies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ruhrgas, one of Germany's largest energy companies, recorded lower profits
and sales last year as a result of growing competition, Mr Klaus Liesen,
chairman of the board, said yesterday.
Net profits for the group fell to DM729m (Dollars 436.5m) last year, from
DM796m in 1992, while group sales declined to DM14.34bn from DM14.4bn over
the same period. Group earnings per share fell to DM20.58 from DM24.24.
Ruhrgas, which controls about 75 per cent of western Germany's gas supplies
and enjoys a virtual monopoly on imports, is facing increasing competition
from Wintershall, the gas distribution subsidiary of BASF, the German
chemical group.
Under an agreement signed this year, Wintershall dented Ruhrgas's virtual
monopoly over gas imports from Russia after it won the right to distribute
gas imported from Gazprom, Russia's state-owned gas company, to VNG. VNG is
the main east German gas distribution network in which Ruhrgas and its
partners holds a majority stake.
Despite more competition, and prospects of eventual liberalisation of
Germany's energy sector, Mr Liesing said he expected stronger sales for
1994. Sales for the first five months of this year increased by 4 per cent
compared with the same period last year.
Ruhrgas, through VNG, can also expect stronger growth in eastern Germany.
Ruhrgas expects demand for natural gas in western Germany to increase by
about 25 per cent by the year 2005, while demand in the eastern states is
expected to triple.

FT  14 JUN 94 / International Company News: Kemira prepares to fulfil
ambition - Sell-off plans are nearing completion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ten years ago Kemira, the Finnish state-owned chemicals group, asked to be
privatised. This autumn, after considerable political hesitancy and a few
market hiccups, it hopes finally to achieve its ambition.
The company, Finland's eighth largest by sales, wants to raise up to FM2bn
(Dollars 361m) in what would be the biggest issue in the country's
accelerating privatisation programme. The bulk of the shares will be offered
to international and Finnish institutions (although there will also be a
retail tranche), cutting state ownership from 100 per cent to as little as
68.4 per cent. The launch date has still to be finalised, but October looks
the most likely month following publication of the group's eight-month
figures.
Much will depend on the state of the markets. Given recent bond and equity
market volatility, some analysts fear the group may be forced to compromise
on the size of the offer or price. They note a sudden rush of big Finnish
share issues - Nokia, the telecommunications group, and Outokumpu, the
mining and metals group, are currently seeking up to FM4bn between them -
which may sap international demand for Finnish shares.
If Mr Heimo Karinen, Kemira chief executive, is nervous about unsettled
markets, he is not showing it. He argues that Kemira has done a lot to put
its house in order and a cyclical upturn in its main businesses is imminent.
The group embarked on a ambitious acquisition programme in the late 1980s,
buying many companies at high prices, just before the market headed
downwards. The impact on the balance sheet has been stark: net debt has
soared to FM8bn and the group's equity-to-assets ratio has sunk to 17 per
cent.
The sell-off is designed to strengthen the company's capital structure, as
it and not the state will garner the proceeds. The main aim is to get the
equity-to-assets ratio above 30 per cent. But Kemira also wants access to
equity capital. Inability to do this in the 1980s forced it to borrow
heavily and explains today's balance sheet weakness.
If the issue does go ahead, investors' main concern is likely to be the
company's Agro division, which accounted for 48 per cent of 1993 sales and
has not made a profit since 1990. In common with other leading fertiliser
manufacturers, Kemira has been badly hurt by market overcapacity and a flood
of imports from eastern Europe. West European fertiliser demand is still
declining by an average of 2 per cent a year.
Mr Karinen admits that Agro will make another loss this year, but he says
there are clear signs of a market upturn in Europe, helped by a reduced flow
of imports from eastern Europe.
In any case, Agro's relative importance is dwindling fast. Kemira's growth
areas are speciality chemicals and titanium dioxide (a pigment used
primarily to make paint), where it has strong market positions. Two
particularly strong niches are water treatment chemicals, where it is
Europe's number one, and pulp and paper chemicals.
Kemira says many of its businesses are starting to benefit from cyclical
economic recovery, mainly through higher volumes. But it also believes the
strength of its competitive position has been enhanced following heavy
rationalisation, currency depreciation and a sharp cutback in capital
expenditure. These factors helped the group to record a FM149.5m net income
after taxes in 1993, after two years of heavy losses.
Mr Karinen says Kemira's cost-cutting has been more vigorous than any of its
main European competitors, partly because it had more to do than its rivals
following its acquisition programme but partly because it acted earlier. The
group has cut around 28 per cent of its workforce since 1990, bringing staff
numbers down to 11,000.
Currency factors have also assisted the group's revival as more than half of
its production is based in Finland, Sweden and the UK. The currencies of all
three countries have depreciated sharply over the past two years.
The group has also learned from past mistakes. Its heavy acquisition and
investment programme means cash flow after investments was negative from
1984 until 1991. Only in the past two years has it been positive, following
a sharp reduction in capital expenditure. The target is to achieve a
positive cash flow after capital expenditure of at least FM500m a year,
which the company says should be sufficient for further investments.

FFr598m

Moulinex, the French household appliances group, suffered a net loss of
FFr598m (Dollars 104.54m) in fiscal 1993, a sharp increase from losses of
FFr41m the previous year.
The company, which is in the process of a substantial refinancing and
restructuring programme, said the results for the year to the end of March
included a FFr185m restructuring charge, a FFr132m exceptional charge
relating to a write-down of R&amp;D investments and a FFr170m charge relating to
product and customer risks.
Moulinex said negotiations with Euris, an investment consortium which is
planning to take a substantial stake in the company, could be completed by
the end of this month. The refinancing package includes a FFr1bn rights
issue, the details of which are being finalised.
In addition to the restructuring charges, last year's results were also
affected by recession in many of the group's principal markets in western
Europe and the impact of exchange rate fluctuations in Italy, Spain and the
UK.
Moulinex said that it had responded to the more difficult economic
environment by cutting inventory levels and reducing capital expenditure to
FFr230m, compared with FFr569m in the previous year.

FT  14 JUN 94 / International Company News: Allianz takes 30% of Berner
Holding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Allianz of Germany, Europe's largest insurance company, yesterday announced
the acquisition of a 30 per cent stake in Switzerland's Berner Holding, in a
rare example of foreign penetration into the highly-regulated Swiss
insurance market.
The deal is one of a number of recent cross-border acquisitions by European
insurance companies, which are expecting an increase in competition as the
European insurance market is liberalised.
Allianz, which made the acquisition through its Italian subsidiary, Riunione
Adriatica di Sicurta, did not disclose details of the price.
In recent transactions European insurers have been sold for amounts equal to
between 50 and 100 per cent of their annual premium income.
In 1993 the consolidated net premium income of Berner Group, one of
Switzerland's leading 10 insurers, amounted to SFr1.08bn (Dollars 771m). The
group had a 4.7 per cent share of the Swiss non-life market in 1992.
Allianz has extended its operations outside Germany in the past 10 years. It
acquired Cornhill of the UK in 1984, and has subsidiaries in most European
markets.
In Switzerland it owns two small companies, Allianz Continentale Allgemeine
and Allianz Continentale Lebensversicherungs. The companies' premium income
amounted to SFr268.5m in 1993.
Allianz said the co-operation with Berner, formed from three smaller
companies in 1990, offered 'interesting perspectives' for both parties.
Although Berner would continue to work as an independently run enterprise,
the deal would strengthen its capital base and increase underwriting
capacity.
Last week Commercial Union, the UK's largest company, announced that it was
poised to pay Pounds 1.46bn (Dollars 2.2bn) to buy the Abeille Assurances
and Abeille Vie operations of Groupe Victoire, France's sixth largest life
insurer.

FT  14 JUN 94 / International Company News: L'Oreal and Nestle move closer
after FFr8.8bn deal
</HEADLINE>

L'Oreal, the world's largest cosmetics group, yesterday announced that it is
to pay FFr8.8bn (Dollars 1.53bn) for four of its distribution companies that
are controlled by Nestle and Mrs Liliane Bettencourt, daughter of L'Oreal's
founder.
The transactions, which will yield FFr4.8bn in cash to Nestle, appear to
increase the likelihood that the Swiss foods group could win control of
L'Oreal.
In April, L'Oreal announced that Nestle and Mrs Bettencourt had agreed to
its wish to take over the distribution companies, based in the US, Canada,
Switzerland and Spain.
In aggregate, Nestle's interest in these companies was slightly over 50 per
cent. The rest was held by Gesparal, a holding company set up 20 years ago
to enable the Swiss group to take a 25 per cent stake in L'Oreal.
Mrs Bettencourt's 51 per cent stake in L'Oreal was put into Gesparal and
Nestle was sold a 49 per cent stake in the new holding company.
Under an agreement between the two Gesparal shareholders, each gave the
other first refusal on their shares, leading to occasional speculation that
Nestle would take over the cosmetics group.
The agreement expired in March, but Nestle claimed that the contract
provided for the right of first refusal for both sides to continue for many
years.
For its part, L'Oreal reiterated that Mrs Bettencourt had always indicated
that she would 'retain majority control during her lifetime'.
The distribution companies are to be sold to L'Oreal at a price based on the
aggregate value of their sales in the year to April 30 1994, subject to the
approval of an EGM due to be held in the autumn. Gesparal will take its
compensation in the form of 3.27m new L'Oreal shares at FFr1,225, thus
raising its stake in L'Oreal from 51.04 per cent to 53.65 per cent. Once the
Gesparal transaction is completed, Nestle will be paid its share, FFr4.78bn,
in cash.
Mr Edouard de Boisgelin, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, said the deal should
have a positive impact on earnings and would strengthen L'Oreal's presence
in international markets.

FT  14 JUN 94 / UK Company News: The most beautiful factory in all the land
 -British Steel's biggest Turkish project since the Bosporus Bridge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
About 100 miles east of Istanbul is a group of new buildings which Mr
William Boyd thinks is the most beautiful factory in Turkey.
'I hope lots of Turkish industrialists drive past and say, 'I want one like
that,'' he says.
Mr Boyd is general manager for central and eastern Europe at British Steel,
which has just completed producing Pounds 3m of structural steel and
cladding for the factory at Adapazari.
From September it is due to be producing Toyota Corollas in a Pounds 325m
joint venture, called Toyotasa, between Turkey's Sabanci group, Toyota
itself and Mitsui, the Japanese trading house.
The contract is very important for British Steel's business strategy in
Turkey.
The Toyotasa plant is highly visible, not only as a striking building in a
mainly agricultural region but also as the first Japanese passenger car
plant in Turkey.
Mr Boyd hopes it will begin a trend for steel to be used in industrial and
other buildings instead of the traditional concrete.
But there is another reason why Mr Boyd - who took over at the Istanbul
office eight months ago - is happy.
British Steel is also supplying Toyotasa with at least 45 per cent of the
steel for the Corollas' body panels, exporting up to 4,500 tonnes of blanks
a year from the UK.
That lifts the total value of British Steel's involvement with Toyotasa to
Pounds 10m, making it the steelmaker's biggest project in Turkey since the
Bosporus Bridge in 1973.
To show how significant British Steel believes the deals are, Mr Brian
Moffat, chairman and chief executive, was personally responsible for the
inaugural tree planting ceremony.
British Steel's trading company in Turkey, British Steel Celik Ticaret, was
set up in 1987, with the UK company holding a 50 per cent stake and Turkish
interests, including the family company Ege Metal, holding the rest.
'Because of Turkey's location it is a natural place for countries from the
Ukraine to Italy to sell steel, and very competitive,' says Mr Boyd. So,
unwilling to compete with the prices offered by subsidised competitors,
British Steel has concentrated on high value added products.
The Toyotasa contract was a classic example. The venture could not get the
quality of galvanised steel it wanted for the cars from local suppliers and
is instead buying two grades from British Steel and Sollac, part of Usinor
Sacilor, and a third grade from Nippon Steel.
British Steel won the order on technical performance and price. It was also
helped by being a supplier of steel coil for Toyota's UK plant near Derby.
The steel for the Toyotasa car bodies is to be processed into blanks by
British Steel Distribution at Warley in the West Midlands, and shipped by
Mitsui to Turkey.
Steel for the factory's pre-coated cladding was shipped from Shotton, north
Wales, and profiled into polyurethane-filled roof and wall panels at British
Steel Yasan in Istanbul, another joint venture in which British Steel has a
25 per cent stake.
The Yasan joint venture has won 10 other small contracts and was profitable
in its first year of operation. It is now bidding to be subcontractor for
whichever of six construction companies builds a proposed Honda car plant in
Turkey.
Next door to the venture, on a dusty industrial estate, a steel service
centre owned by Yasan, 50 per cent shareholder in BSY, is being converted
into a showpiece for steel cladding.
The Toyotasa plant was designed by Ove Arup, but persuading Turkish
architects to specify more steel for factories, offices and even high-rise
apartment blocks may not be easy.
'It's just that we have been slow to change from concrete,' said Mr Sarik
Tara, chairman of Enka, Turkey's largest construction company and builder of
the Toyotasa plant.
Mr Boyd is betting that where Enka goes, other Turkish construction
companies will surely follow.
He also hopes British Steel can benefit indirectly from the push by the
Turkish construction sector into eastern Europe and neighbouring CIS
republics. The immediate prospects of further work in Turkey for BSY are not
that bright because of Turkey's austerity package announced in April and
uncertainty over the future of the economy and the Turkish lira.
Industrialists are holding back from building new factories, but Mr Boyd
says the long-term future is quite good, with a lot of infrastructural work
needed in Turkey.
The trading company is also likely to see volumes fall this year, after
rising steadily to 110,000 tonnes last year.
But Mr Boyd has high hopes of developing the market for more specialised UK
flat-rolled steel.
He is currently trying to persuade Arcelik, the fast-growing Turkish white
goods producer, to buy white pre-painted steel, rather than set up a paint
shop at a proposed new fridge factory.
At Toyotasa, meanwhile, Mr Ozdemir Sabanci, president, admits he is relieved
the plant is opening in September rather than now, when car sales in Turkey
have virtually ground to a halt.
But although he is less optimistic than some about the Turkish car market,
he still believes it will rise from a record 440,000 units last year to
600,000 by the end of the decade.
Toyotasa is due to produce about 2,000 cars this year and 30,000 in 1995.
It has promised the Turkish government it will have capacity of 100,000 by
May 1997.
The venture is also studying whether to add further Toyota models, said Mr
Sabanci.
On current forecasts of demand, British Steel's supply of blanks would last
about four years, and while there are no guarantees, the UK company should
be in a good position to supply for longer.
Toyotasa has promised Ankara that cars from the plant will have 70 per cent
local content after five years of production.
But if Turkey is in the European Union by then, the UK steel - and engines
being supplied by Toyota's Deeside plant - would count as local content.
Also, while Mr Sabanci believes component suppliers may set up around the
car plant as demand grows, steel for the car bodies will not be available in
Turkey 'for the foreseeable future,' he says.
It may be going a bit far to bracket Adapazari with Coventry or Luton, but
at least parts of the plant's new cars will be British.
