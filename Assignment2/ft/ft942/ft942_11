Increased sales volume and reduced interest charges helped James Cropper,
the Cumbria-based paper and board manufacturer, announce record profits.
On turnover ahead 13 per cent, to Pounds 45.7m, profits before tax more than
doubled from Pounds 1.25m to Pounds 2.56m for the 53 weeks ended April 2.
The directors attributed a 'significant reduction' in borrowings to the
group's strong cash flow.
Order books were currently full and sales above budget.
A recommended final dividend of 2.4p brings the total for the period to 3.5p
(3.1p) covered over 5 times by earnings of 19p (9.4p) per share.

FT  14 JUN 94 / UK Company News: St Modwen property sales to raise Pounds
37m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
St Modwen Properties, the Birmingham-based property development and
investment company, is to sell Pounds 37.3m of properties, which should
bring in total net profits of close to Pounds 8m.
It has sold the Octagon Shopping Centre in Burton-on-Trent to Scottish
Amicable for Pounds 22.9m, representing a yield of close to 7 per cent. In
addition, it has disposed of a retail development project to Mercury
Property Fund for Pounds 14.4m.
Mr Stan Clarke, chairman, said: 'I believe that the property market in many
areas has reached a peak in prices'.
St Modwen's share price reacted favourably to the sales, rising 3p to 49p.
The disposals were in line with the company's strategy of focusing on second
grade properties where it can enhance the rental income through intensive
management.
The proceeds will reduce gearing to 50 per cent, although acquisitions are
likely to follow.
The sale of Octagon will realise a Pounds 3m net profit, after writing off
Pounds 700,000 for the winding down of a related interest rate swap. It will
repay Pounds 11m of connected debt.
The sale of the Oldbury Green development site in the West Midlands was
expected, after the company signed up tenants for the 12.5 acre site, with
Sainsbury's Homebase as its anchor. The net profits are believed to be close
to Pounds 5m.

Cullen's Holdings, the grocery retailer, suffered pre-tax losses of Pounds

Mr Rayne added that in the current year sales of the Neighbourhood Food

FT  14 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Old Mutual to launch first UK S African
trust
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Old Mutual, the life company which is South Africa's largest institutional
investor, is to launch the UK's first South African investment trust.
The Old Mutual South Africa Trust is hoping to raise about Pounds 50m to
invest in a range of South African companies, with a bias towards smaller
and medium-sized companies and the financial and industrial sectors. The
fund will be managed with a bottom-up, stock-picking style.
The fund's managers say that South Africa combines much of the growth
potential of an emerging market with the developed infrastructure of an
advanced industrialised economy and a stock market more than 100 years old.
The ending of sanctions and improved political stability provide encouraging
opportunities for growth.
The fund's bias towards smaller companies is intended to avoid duplicating
investment in areas which are easily accessible to foreign institutional
investors, focusing instead on areas of the market for which research is not
widely available overseas.
South Africa is due to be included in the IFC emerging markets index, where
it will have a weighting of about 13 per cent. This is expected to lead to
heavy inflows of overseas money into South Africa, and the Old Mutual trust
hopes to appeal to institutions looking for a quick way to increase South
African exposure in line with the index.
The fund is mainly targeted at institutional investors, but there will also
be a public offer to allow private investors a chance to participate.
Lord Tombs, former chairman of Rolls-Royce, will chair the trust, with other
board members drawn from Old Mutual and the UK investment trust sector.
Shares will be issued at 100p with one warrant attached to every five
shares. The public offer opens on June 23, and closes on July 1.

FT  14 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Jarvis shares fall as loss emerges at
Pounds 3.2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM DELLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares of Jarvis dipped 3p to 13 1/2 p yesterday after the building, civil
engineering and property group announced a further deficit reflecting
continuing problems in its construction activities.
On turnover down 23 per cent to Pounds 70.8m, the pre-tax loss for the 1993
year narrowed from Pounds 3.72m to Pounds 3.15m.
Mr Harvey Bard, chairman, said that despite a 'reasonable' contribution from
property and an improved showing from the products and services side, the
group incurred losses 'significantly greater than anticipated' in
construction where 'severe trading conditions . . . showed no sign of
improvement'. This, he said, had dealt a 'severe blow' to recovery hopes
expressed at the interim stage.
Tender prices were depressed by 'intense' competition, making it difficult
to cover overhead costs. Substantial loss provisions were required against a
large road contract in Essex where problems continue, while a pipeline
contract for Severn Trent Water incurred heavy losses before its completion.
Despite the Pounds 2.4m rights issue last summer, shareholders funds dipped
to Pounds 13m (Pounds 13.3m) by the year end, equal to 36p per share.
Future cash demands of a reduced construction operation will be funded by
realising part of the investment property portfolio.
Losses per share were 10.5p (9.9p rights adjusted).

<TEXT>
Lloyds Chemists, the UK's second largest pharmaceuticals retailer, yesterday
announced it was to buy Daniels, a pharmaceutical wholesaling and
manufacturing business, for Pounds 10.5m.
Mr Peter Lloyd, chief executive, said the acquisition would increase the
company's national wholesaling business and expand its customer base. He
said the deal was also an opportunity to build pharmaceutical manufacturing
interests.
Daniels, made up of Daniels Pharmaceutical, Shapebase and H Wilkinson,
operates a wholesaling business in the north-west of England, the east
Midlands, East Anglia and the northern home counties.
It also owns a manufacturing business in Derby and a surgical wholesale
business in Nottingham. Operating profits were Pounds 1.55m in the year to
June 30 1993 with net assets at the date of Pounds 913,000.
Lloyds has expanded its geographical spread during the last 12 months,
acquiring 25 pharmacies throughout the UK bringing the number of its retail
outlets to 1,510.
In March Lloyds reported a 16 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits
to Pounds 26.2m (Pounds 22.6m) for the six months to December on sales up 17
per cent to Pounds 460m.

The annual report for 1993, published yesterday, showed that in the period

17,595 in pension contributions as well as the compensation package.
Sir Kit McMahon, who took over as chairman on a non-executive basis, was

Encouraging demand helped Banner Homes Group, which obtained a full listing
in December, increase pre-tax profit for the year to March 31 from Pounds
250,000 to Pounds 1.2m.
Turnover was ahead at Pounds 8.31m (Pounds 6.63m).
Housing output more than doubled with 68 units sold, up from 32, and Mr
Stuart Crossley, chairman, was optimistic about a recovery in the market.
'As values edge upwards negative equity problems appear to be receding.
There is now a whole new generation of home owners who, since the market
bottomed out, have seen the value of their home increase and the cost of
their mortgage decrease.'
The Pounds 3m proceeds of a rights issue received in January have been
invested in new sites and the company plans to have 278 units under
construction on 20 sites by the end of 1994.
Gearing at the year end was 104 per cent, with borrowings covered by the
Pounds 900,000 income stream from the fully let industrial properties.
Earnings came out at 8.3p (1.9p). Dividends are resumed with a proposed
final of 1p.

FT  14 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Royal Bank expands in US with Dollars 140m
buy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Royal Bank of Scotland yesterday announced a further addition to Citizens
Financial Group, its fast-growing US retail banking subsidiary, with the
proposed Dollars 139.9m (Pounds 93.2m) acquisition of the
Massachusetts-based Quincy Savings Bank.
Royal Bank said it would inject Dollars 115m of capital into Citizens to
fund the purchase, which is the fourth acquisition in the past year, and the
seventh since it acquired Citizens, the fifth largest New England bank, in
1988.
Royal Bank is paying 1.9 times the book value of Quincy, or Dollars 25.75
per share. This is higher than the multiple of its past acquisitions, which
it said was because of growing competition to buy banks as part of an
industry consolidation.
Mr George Mathewson, Royal Bank's chief executive, said that the
acquisition, which is subject to approval by Quincy's shareholders and
regulators, would reinforce its presence on the east coast of Massachusetts
south of Boston.
He said that Citizens would be able to cut costs significantly in Quincy's
14-branch network by centralising operations. Some branches are expected to
be closed and combined with existing Citizens branches.
Quincy made a first quarter profit of Dollars 1.9m this year after reporting
a full-year loss for 1993 of Dollars 8.5m. This was mainly caused by
provisions for loans and real estate losses of Dollars 23m following the New
England property market downturn.
Mr Mathewson said Royal Bank had examined Quincy's asset quality and was
satisfied that no further problems would emerge. He said it had a very
strong deposit base, and Citizens hoped to sell other products to its
customers.
He said that Citizens expected to expand further through acquisition, but
expected that it would not grow beyond Dollars 12bn in assets. The purchase
of Quincy, which has assets of Dollars 833m, will bring Citizens' assets to
Dollars 8.9bn.
Mr Mathewson said the purchase would weaken Royal Bank's capital ratios only
slightly. Royal Bank did not intend to sell Citizens, 'but obviously we want
to make it a better business which would be more attractive'.

<TEXT>
Shanks &amp; McEwan, the waste management company, yesterday closed the book on
four months of searching to announce the appointment of Mr Mike Averill,
group operating officer, as chief executive.
He replaces Mr Gordon Waddell, who had been acting as temporary chief
executive since the abrupt departure of Mr Roger Hewitt in January following
a profits warning. Mr Hewitt is understood to have left the group following
pressure from institutional investors over Shanks' performance and a lack of
confidence in its management.
Mr Averill, 43, had been tipped as the most likely candidate to replace Mr
Hewitt. He came to Shanks through the acquisition of Rechem in 1993, where
he had been managing director.

losses of IPounds 4.6m (Pounds 4.71m) in the six months to March 31 after a
IPounds 8m provision to dispose of its wire businesses.
Profits last time were IPounds 2.68m.
The interim dividend, however, is lifted to 4.5p (4.4p), because, before the
provision, operating profits rose 26 per cent to IPounds 3.89m (IPounds
3.08m) on sales of IPounds 84.8m (IPounds 63.3m). The wire businesses
recorded losses of IPounds 700,000 in the six month period.
Mr Peter Gray, finance director, said the proposed divestment was an
important piece of refocusing for the company and would reinforce welding
and heating as Unidare's core businesses. After the disposal, nearly 85 per
cent of the company's turnover will be generated by these two sectors.
He anticipated the second half would show improvement subject to the
elimination of the losses from the wire division.
Mr Gray said the welding division continued to perform well, mainly due to
the integration of Nasco, the US welding distribution business. In the UK
increased exports pushed up sales although the outlook was 'patchy', he
said.
Unidare maintained its share of the UK's storage heater market although
profits from that division were below previous years.
Losses per share stood at 26.53p (earnings 12.52p).
The shares closed 10p down yesterday at 335p.

FT  14 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Dixons to accelerate Currys revamp
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dixons, the electrical retailer, is accelerating the shift of its Currys
chain into out-of-town superstores by disposing of 100 high street branches
this year, writes Neil Buckley.
The group has appointed Conrad Ritblat Sinclair Goldsmith to rationalise
Currys. Costs of the programme will be disclosed next month.
Dixons said moving Currys out of town had long been its aim, but although it
had reduced the high street stores from 500 to 335, it had been held back by
the sluggish property market. Keeping stores open had often proved better
than closing them without being able to dispose of the lease. However,
Dixons said the property market was now recovering and the 'trend of
improving returns in the high street stores has come to an end'.
Dixons plans to add up to 40 stores to Currys' 158 superstores this year.

FT  14 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Exceptional gain cuts Prospect loss to
Pounds 0.5m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Prospect Industries, the specialist engineer, reported a lower seasonal loss
of Pounds 489,000 pre-tax for the six months to March 31, against Pounds
1.24m. The result was helped by an exceptional gain of Pounds 736,000
arising from the sale of a loan note.
Mr Philip Wilbraham, chairman, said the company continued to operate in an
aggressive and competitive environment. However, it had won a record number
of orders, including increased work overseas.
He added: 'At this stage of the year the future looks encouraging.'
Taking into account the outlook the interim dividend is raised from 0.275p
to 0.29p. Losses per share were down at 0.08p (0.56p) or 0.05p (0.43p) fully
diluted.
Turnover slipped to Pounds 21.4m against Pounds 22.1m including Pounds
594,000 from discontinued activities. The operating loss from continuing
activities was lower at Pounds 1.01m (Pounds 1.03m).

FT  14 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Oriflame advances 17% to Pounds 14m -
Better than expected growth in Latin America and eastern Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Strong growth in new markets has encouraged Oriflame International, the
door-to-door cosmetics group, to give shareholders their first dividend
increase in four years.
Oriflame accompanied this with the announcement of a 17 per cent rise to
Pounds 14m in pre-tax profits for the year to March 31.
Sales growth, held back by currency movements, increased by just 4 per cent
to Pounds 86.7m.
Mr Robert af Jochnick, chairman, said the three years of steady profits
growth had left Oriflame well positioned for a dividend increase. The
payment was raised 9 per cent to 8.7p for a total 8 per cent higher at 13p.
Earnings were 10 per cent up at 22.4p.
The shares rose 6p to close at 270p.
Mr af Jochnick said Oriflame had enjoyed better than expected growth both
through its own efforts in emerging markets such as Latin America, and
through Oresa, its eastern European sister company.
Oriflame founded Oresa three years ago to tackle the newly-opened eastern
European markets. To minimalise risk, Oriflame had limited its stake to 24
per cent. The UK-quoted group receives royalties for use of the Oriflame
brandname and supplies product from its Irish factory.
Oresa contributed a total of Pounds 5m to overall profits last year, Mr af
Jochnick said.
Aco, the Swedish toiletries brand acquired in 1991, continued to exceed all
expectations, Mr af Jochnick said. Sales were 9 per cent ahead in local
currency, although exchange rates left the sterling contribution 5 per cent
lower. Aco contributed a further Pounds 5m in profits to the overall group.
The chairman said Oriflame was confident of substantial growth this year
through its focus on emerging markets such as Latin America and Asia. These
were showing a substantial improvement in sales for the first two months of
the year, albeit from a small base. He expected emerging markets to account
for about Pounds 15m of turnover by the end of the year.

FT  14 JUN 94 / UK Company News: ICI considers Pakistan plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ICI is considering spending more than Dollars 300m (Pounds 200m) on building
a chemicals plant in Pakistan.
The plant would increase ICI's manufacturing capacity in teraphthalic acid
(PTA), used in the manufacture of polyester fibre, by one third and be the
first such plant in Pakistan.
The project has yet to receive the approval of ICI's board, a process which
is likely to take several months.
The investment would come from ICI Pakistan, the 61.5 per cent-owned
subsidiary, which already produces polyester fibre, soda ash and other
substances.
The plant would have a capacity of 300,000 tonnes a year, compared with the
250,000 tonnes PTA plant ICI built two years ago in Taiwan.
ICI said yesterday that the Pakistan market for PTA was growing at 15 per
cent a year, currently satisfied entirely by imports.
The PTA market is growing quickly around the world, with Amoco, the US
petrochemicals company, the market leader. ICI said global PTA capacity was
9.4m tonnes a year, compared with 2.3m tonnes a year in 1980. The growth was
the equivalent of two or three 'world scale plants' such as that proposed in
Pakistan being built each year, said ICI.

FT  14 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Christian Salvesen dip in line with warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In line with a profits warning issued in January, Christian Salvesen, the
distribution and specialist hire group, reported its first downturn in
annual profits since the 1970s with a pre-tax fall from Pounds 75.9m to
Pounds 74.1m for the year to March 31.
The shares, which have underperformed the market by almost 20 per cent this
year, added 8p to close at 255p.
Thanks to a lower tax charge earnings per share were steady at 19.2p (19.1p)
and a recommended final of 4.8p gives a total dividend up 4 per cent to
8.1p.
Sir Alick Rankin, chairman, said this reflected the board's confidence in
the future.
'We expect a better year, but are, not surprisingly, treating it with
caution,' he said.
Analysts are looking for profits to rise to about Pounds 80m with earnings
per share rising to about 20p.
The company said it had tackled the problems at Aggreko, the specialist
plant hire business which has been the engine of growth in recent years.
Aggreko has reversed an expansion into the competitive US construction
market and the workforce in the US has been cut by 10 per cent.
With Aggreko's European operations also affected by recession, its operating
profits slipped from Pounds 28.2m to Pounds 26.5m.
The distribution side turned in flat profits of Pounds 35.6m (Pounds 35.2m),
excluding a Pounds 4.2m contribution from acquisitions.
Food distribution, which services most of the main UK supermarket chains,
was slightly ahead.
Profits from the consumer products contract with Marks and Spencer were down
since its fees were based on a formula linked to UK short-term interest
rates. This has now been renegotiated.
Mr Chris Masters, chief executive, said grocery distribution in the UK was
now a mature market and the division's growth was seen coming largely from
its industrial business. This was significantly expanded by the acquisition
of Swift for Pounds 84.5m in October 1993.
The deal pushed group gearing from 14 per cent to 51 per cent over the year,
but it should be down below 45 per cent by the end of this year.
Profits from the brick business rose by 76 per cent to Pounds 3m. Vikoma,
the pollution control equipment manufacturer which is up for sale, turned in
Pounds 1.5m.
Profits included a net Pounds 6.6m from the release of provisions, taken
below the line in 1992, to cover the closure of its German manufacturer
distribution business. This was offset by write-offs elsewhere to leave a
net exceptional gain of just Pounds 100,000.

Cannon Assurance, an offshoot of Lincoln National, the US life assurance
group, is taking legal action against the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building
Society claiming it has not been paid fees for introducing mortgage
customers.
The dispute follows the termination of a joint-venture between the two
companies in October 1992. For a period of about 18 months Cannon sold
mortgage packages, produced by C&amp;G Guardian, a centralised mortgage lender
taken over by C&amp;G in 1990.
Cannon claims no fees have been paid since January 1993. A writ was issued
last week.

FT  14 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Inflatables side sold by Avon Rubber for
Pounds 7.8m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Avon Rubber is selling its lossmaking inflatable boats business for a total
of Pounds 7.8m to a former director of GEC.
This is almost the last of the troublesome businesses to be dealt with in
the restructuring which has carried the tyres and automotive components
group through four years of recession.
It is estimated to have incurred pre-tax losses of Pounds 2.5m over the last
three years and is expected to incur a loss of about Pounds 700,000 for the
nine months it will have been included this year. Avon has had to provide a
secured guarantee to the new company's banking facilities of up to Pounds 3m
until September 1995.
Avon Marine, a company set up by Mr David Powell, a former GEC director, is
buying the business. Avon Rubber is taking a 10 per cent stake worth Pounds
420,000 as part of the purchase price, as well as a cash payment of Pounds
2.9m, and will have a seat on the board.
Marine will also take on Pounds 3.7m in debt, and pay a further Pounds
780,000 to Avon Rubber following the sale of certain stocks.
CINVen, the venture capital company, is backing the transaction and will
also have a seat on the board.
The division's net assets are estimated at Pounds 4.6m, resulting in a
goodwill write-off of Pounds 3.1m. Avon Rubber's gearing is expected to fall
from 33 per cent to 28 per cent as a result of the transaction.

FT  14 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Few non-professional investors can
understand new accounts guidance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Few non-professional investors can understand the operating and financial
review, the new guidance on commentary in accounts which is designed to
explain a company's performance in words, a survey suggested yesterday.
Analysts and investors believe non-professional readers of accounts will not
bother to read nor be able to use the information in the review, research
sponsored by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland said.
Professionals, however, found them very useful.
The review was introduced by the Accounting Standards Board last year as a
voluntary code, and its guidelines are now being followed by a growing
number of companies.
The aim is to allow directors to describe their company's performance in a
way that they feel most appropriate, outside the restrictions of formal
accounting standards.
The survey, conducted by Professor Pauline Weetman, director of research for
the Institute, calls for the review to be made into a mandatory standard as
quickly as possible.
It says the review should have statutory backing through changes to Stock
Exchange rules or more rigorous audit guidelines.
Based on detailed interviews with 20 institutional investors and senior
staff with broking firms, it rejects the argument by companies that much new
information cannot be disclosed because it is commercially sensitive.
It says companies should see the review as a way to demonstrate their
openness and accountability by reporting significant uncertainties and
providing forward-looking information.
It also recommends that ways should be found to reduce the time lag between
a company's results and the production of the annual report months later.

FT  14 JUN 94 / UK Company News: A move to regain the initiative - A look at
the attractions of the Viglen purchase for Amstrad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Amstrad's proposed acquisition of Viglen, the PC manufacturer which sells
its machines direct to its customers, represents a significant shift in the
UK consumer electronic group's strategy.
Mr Alan Sugar, Amstrad's founder and chairman, acknowledged this yesterday
when he said the deal represented the start of 'a new direction for the
company'.
'We are looking to be in businesses where the products we are producing will
be sold directly to the parties that use them,' Mr Sugar said.
The Amstrad chairman, who has been a bitter critic in the past of the
purchasing policies followed by the high street multiples like Dixons, said
the move represented the natural outcome of the erosion of margins in the
traditional distribution channels.
Amstrad has seen the margins on nearly all of its traditional product lines,
including personal computers, evaporate as competitors rushed into consumer
electronics markets pioneered by the company.
Two years ago, when Mr Sugar proposed buying back the Amstrad shares he did
not already own for 30p each, he claimed he was making the proposal because
Amstrad had run out of ideas and become just another 'me-too' company
lacking 'blockbuster products' and destined to deliver only mediocre
profits.
However, Amstrad's shareholders turned down his buy-back proposal and Mr
Sugar said yesterday that the group's new direct sales strategy was an
attempt to steer Amstrad back towards 'large profits'.
By selling directly to customers Amstrad believes it will be able to
recapture the margin that has traditionally gone to retailers.
Mr Sugar said yesterday that a similar direct sales approach would be taken
by Dancall Radio, the Danish-based advanced digital telecommunications
equipment group which Amstrad acquired last September.
The Amstrad chairman added that the new distribution policy had the full
support of Mr David Rogers, the senior Philips executive who was appointed
Amstrad's chief executive earlier this month.
Mr Rogers' job at Amstrad will be to oversee a rapidly growing group of
operating companies including Viglen, Dancall and Betacom, the consumer
telecommunications equipment manufacturer which is majority owned by Amstrad
but which also retains a separate quote.
He will also be in charge of Amstrad's traditional consumer electronics
business which, among other products, also makes a range of Amstrad personal
computers.
Most analysts have been expecting Amstrad to abandon the PC business
altogether because of its wafer-thin margins and the fast pace of technical
innovation which means that manufacturers always risk sitting on stock with
a declining value.
However, Mr Sugar emphasised that it had never been Amstrad's intention to
abandon the PC business altogether, only the low-margin retail end of the
business.
Explaining the decision to buy Viglen he said the company was 'not just a
box shifter'.
He said Viglen had developed an increasingly profitable business delivering
'made to measure' PCs mainly to corporate, government and institutional
customers which distinguished it from other so-called PC 'clone' assemblers.
Over the past few years the UK PC market has become increasingly competitive
as clone manufacturers - many of which also sell directly through computer
magazines - have cut prices in an effort to boost volumes.
However, Viglen, along with a handful of other UK-based PC manufacturers and
assemblers like north London-based Elonex, have managed to differentiate
their products and customer service and establish themselves as second-tier
PC suppliers behind industry leaders such as IBM and Compaq Computer.
Mr Sugar emphasised that Viglen would continue to be run by the mainly
Armenian team of young entrepreneurs who have built the business up over the
past five years.

FT  14 JUN 94 / Wellcome Trust seeks move to venture capital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Wellcome Trust, the UK's largest charitable trust, is seeking to
persuade the Charity Commission to approve a trustees' decision to invest
Pounds 100m in venture capital projects.
Permission of the Charity Commission is not legally required, but Wellcome
Trust would be uncomfortable in making a significant investment which
regulators might be unhappy about, said Sir Roger Gibbs, trust director. In
July 1987, Wellcome Trust secured legal permission to engage in a variety of
investment activities, including venture capital.
The move, which would place 2 per cent of the roughly Pounds 5.5bn of assets
into venture capital, could provide a fillip for the sector. It appears the
trust would like to invest in US-based venture capital projects. The process
might take up to three years.
Sir Roger said: 'We believe it imperative to protect the capital value of
our fund whilst at the same time generating a sizeable income for the
benefit of medical research.' He added that income from the trust's
investments was expected to generate more than Pounds 220m this year, more
than enough to meet commitments.
The average UK charity has a 'negligible' exposure to venture capital, while
the average UK pension scheme has less than 1 per cent of assets in the
sector, according to WM Company, a performance measurement service. However,
a handful of the UK's largest pension schemes, such as those of British Coal
and PosTel, have as much as 3 per cent of their assets in the sector and
have profited handsomely over the years.
Venture capital is considered more risky than investment in securities
although potential returns are higher. The projects are more speculative and
the investments are illiquid, depending on either a trade sale or a
flotation for investors to realise a gain.
The Charity Commission said on Friday that while it had no specific rules
barring venture capital investment, charities might invest only in areas set
out in their trust deeds. Venture capital is an unusual investment for a
charity because it is unlikely immediately to generate the cash most
charities require.
There is concern that the Charity Commission may view venture capital
investment as engaging in a trade or business, activities forbidden to
charities. However, investment advisers to Wellcome Trust believe the
charity has a strong case for venture capital investment. First, its
existing portfolio and 40 per cent stake in the Wellcome drug company give
it ample cashflow to meet its charitable objectives, which are to fund
research in the bio-medical field. Venture capital would provide capital
growth.
Second, a portion of the venture capital funds might be invested in start-up
bio-technology companies which commercially exploit scientific research.
This would be consistent with the charity's mission, its advisers believe.
The Trust has professional advisers on investments and risks would be
reduced by diversifying them.

FT  14 JUN 94 / Record year for UK securities firms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last year was the most profitable for the UK securities industry since
record keeping began in 1988, with revenues rising by 53 per cent, the
London Stock Exchange said yesterday.
Return on capital was also at its highest level, with an average return of
20 per cent recorded. In 1992, the average return was only 3 per cent.
In an article in its Quarterly Report, the exchange said its member firms
compared favourably with those of the New York Stock Exchange, where the
average return on capital was 17 per cent. However, the data are not
strictly comparable.
But the survey of profitability notes some worrying trends, particularly the
growth in costs. Overall, firms' expenses for the year rose by 15 per cent.
However, the pace quickened in the second half of the year when new issue
activity and turnover reached record levels.
In the third quarter, expenses rose by 18 per cent and by 34 per cent in the
fourth quarter. Salary costs showed the most marked increase, rising 95 per
cent over 1992, partly reflecting the effects of profit-related bonuses. By
the fourth quarter of 1993, these bonuses accounted on average for 29 per
cent of salary costs, up from less than 10 per cent in the first quarter.
The stock exchange said its research showed that the largest and the
smallest firms were the most consistently successful. Of the smallest firms,
with less than Pounds 5m in capital, 80-83 per cent were in profit in each
of the four quarters of 1993. All the firms with capital of more than Pounds
150m were profitable during the first three quarters.
The stock exchange concluded that '1993 proved to be a turning point in the
performance of the securities industry'.
Looking to 1994, it noted that volatility in securities markets in the first
quarter meant that a drop in dealing profits would undermine overall
performance in the industry this year, despite signs that commission revenue
and corporate fees would remain high.
Separately, the Quarterly Report carried the results of a stock exchange
study into turnover statistics on continental European exchanges. It
suggested that the growth of cross-border trading in London had not been at
the expense of other domestic exchanges.
'Much of the trading on the International Equity Market (in London) is new
business and the relationship with domestic markets has generally been
complementary - business has grown rapidly on both,' the exchange said.

FT  14 JUN 94 / Knight cheerful at entry to lists: John Gapper talks to Sir
Brian Pitman about the hitch in Lloyds' Pounds 1.8bn bid for C&amp;G
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On his first working day as a knight, Sir Brian Pitman had lost none of the
ebullience of his last weeks as a commoner. Since he disclosed in April that
Lloyds Bank had bid Pounds 1.8bn to take over Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester
Building Society, he has insisted that the deal will not be scuppered.
'In my experience, it would be very unusual if two boards of directors are
determined to get together, and there are clear benefits to customers and
shareholders, that they cannot complete the deal,' he said yesterday. C&amp;G is
trying to revise the terms of the offer barred by the High Court.
That has been the judgment of the stock market since last week's court
ruling. Lloyds' shares have hardly wobbled, closing at 576p yesterday
despite having leapt 48p to 585p on the day of the announcement. This has
baffled analysts who say they should have fallen further.
'If I was a fund manager, I would be selling the shares aggressively,' said
Mr Neil Baker, banks analyst at Credit Lyonnais Laing. Mr Baker argues that
Lloyds' shares will be 'very over-valued' if the bank fails to achieve the
latest of a series of proposed acquisitions since the mid 1980s.
It would be the third big setback to Lloyds' acquisition strategy. The bank
was rebuffed in its 1986 attempt to take over Standard Chartered with a
mixture of preference shares and cash, and in its 'proposed' Pounds 3.7bn
bid for Midland Bank using ordinary shares and cash two years ago.
The confidence of Lloyds' chief executive has not wavered. Sir Brian said
that 'from the thinking I have seen' it would be possible for C&amp;G to devise
a new scheme that would comply with the law. He also indicated that the pair
wanted to avoid another scheme being tested in court.
'The Building Societies Commission will want to go through whatever is
proposed, but I am hopeful that a scheme can be devised that they find
acceptable,' he said. There was no regulatory pressure for Lloyds to clarify
its intentions before C&amp;G came up with a revised scheme.
Yet Lloyds could face a sharp reversal of fortune if the C&amp;G bid were
eventually blocked, by regulatory constraint or a failure to persuade enough
members to vote for it. This would not simply be because it would look
accident-prone in failing to consummate large bids.
The C&amp;G purchase answers two difficulties for Lloyds. One is that its UK
retail banking business has been growing very slowly. There is little demand
for loans, and it has already exploited the easiest opportunities to sell
other products such as life insurance to its customers.
The second is that it provides a way for Lloyds to use excess capital more
profitably than simply investing it in money markets. Without a C&amp;G into
which to plough its surplus earnings, Lloyds would face pressure from
shareholders to come up with an alternative.
Lloyds' attempts to grow by acquisition fall into three categories:
Small agreed purchases of niche players. Examples of these acquisitions
include its 1984 purchase of Schroder Munchmeyer Hengst, a German private
bank, and its acquisition last year of the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation
for Pounds 27m.
Such purchases tend to be ignored because of their size. But Sir Brian
argues that they exemplify Lloyds' strategy 'of selective market leadership.
We do not have to be the biggest in any market, but we have to have a strong
competitive position.' Large hostile takeovers, such as the tilts at
Standard Chartered and Midland. Sir Brian defends the logic of both deals.
Yet his appetite for hostile deals appears to have been diminished by the
Midland affair. Other Lloyds directors were disturbed at the controversy it
created.
Medium-sized agreed deals. The obvious example, apart from C&amp;G, is the move
which saw Lloyds swap a set of businesses, including its estate agencies and
its unit trusts and insurance arm, for a 57.6 per cent stake in Lloyds Abbey
Life in 1988. This also bolstered its UK retail banking business.
Analysts differ on what sort of deal Lloyds might seek if it was left with
its Pounds 1.8bn after being jilted by C&amp;G members. A fresh large hostile
bid seems to have become less likely. But Lloyds would have to buy a lot of
niche players in order to spend its money.
One possibility would be a private bank or fund manager. This could help to
meet demand for alternatives to savings deposits. But Mr Chris Ellerton, an
analyst at SG Warburg, says it would cost more and involve more risk because
'you would be buying people rather than net assets'.
Mr John Aitken, an analyst at UBS, says that Lloyds will not have much time
because it cannot 'sit there while capital keeps building up'. He suggests
that Lloyds might even be driven to a revolutionary move - giving the money
back to shareholders in a special distribution.

FT  14 JUN 94 / Protest at Emap's move on Trans World
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Directors of Trans World Communications, the leading UK commercial radio
group, yesterday sought legal advice after Emap, the media and exhibitions
group, said it planned to buy the 22 per cent of the company owned by Mr
Owen Oyston.
Mr Oyston, a millionaire businessman, has agreed to sell his stake at 181p a
share if an offer is made to Trans World shareholders between now and June
22. Emap, which already owns nearly 30 per cent of Trans World, is seeking a
recommended offer at 181p which would value the group at around Pounds 70m.
If agreement cannot be reached, it is likely to push ahead with a hostile
offer.
Controversy was growing last night because an Emap takeover of Trans World
would breach the legal limit on the number and size of commercial radio
licences which can be held by one company.
Under broadcasting legislation, no company is able to hold more than six
large licences - each broadcasting to more than 1m adults. The combined
group would bring eight such licences under one roof including Radio City in
Liverpool, Kiss FM in London, Radio Piccadilly in Manchester and Radio Aire
in Leeds.
The Radio Authority, the industry regulator, has agreed, however, that an
'ownership structure' can be put in place for part of Emap's existing radio
interests to enable it to comply with the rules.
It is believed that a number of Emap's smaller licences would be put into a
Pounds 100 company set up by Schroders, the merchant bank. The company, in
which Emap could probably have a 49 per cent stake, would own the licences,
leaving the media group with operational control.
Critics said last night the decision opened the way for anyone to try to get
round the ownership rules, which are designed to limit concentration of
ownership in commercial radio.
Trans World directors will be looking at the possibility of seeking a
judicial review of the Radio Authority's decision, and a complaint to the
Takeover Panel has not been ruled out.
The Radio Authority has told the government that the licence system, which
is operated alongside a points system - no company can own more than 15 per
cent of all the points in the system - should be changed.
The authority's acceptance of Emap's proposal is the second controversial
decision it has made recently. It approved a takeover purchase by Reuters
Holdings, the media and information group, of London News Radio, which picks
up the two London broadcasting licences of LBC this autumn. This means that
Reuters - which applied unsuccessfully for the licences - has taken over the
winning company before it has gone on air.

FT  14 JUN 94 / KPN beats market on first day
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   AMSTERDAM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Koninklijke PTT Nederland, the partially privatised Dutch telecommunications
and postal company, staged a moderate rise on its first day of trading in
Amsterdam yesterday.
The shares, priced at Fl 49.75 last week, opened at Fl 50.50 and quickly
rose to a high of Fl 50.70 before falling back to close at Fl 50.20.
The premium was more pronounced for private investors, who had been offered
a discount of Fl 2.50 per share up to 75 shares as an incentive to take part
in the largest share launch in Dutch history. Nearly 60 per cent of the
shares on offer were taken up by foreign institutions.
Trading was active, with more than 17m shares changing hands, a new record
for a day's trading in one stock in Amsterdam. The rise in KPN's shares ran
counter to yesterday's lower trend for Dutch equities.
The government of the Netherlands sold 138.15m KPN shares - a 30 per cent
stake - raising Fl 6.9bn (Pounds 2.5bn). A second tranche of KPN shares is
expected to be sold by the end of 1997.
The European Options Exchange in Amsterdam also launched options trading in
KPN yesterday, the first time in the Netherlands that options and equity
trading in a new issue has taken place simultaneously.
The share issue was nearly three times subscribed. Applications from private
shareholders were honoured in full up to 75 shares, with a sliding scale
above this level. Some 188,500 private shareholders took part, of whom
31,000 were KPN employees.

FT  14 JUN 94 / Government welcomes reform plan for universities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A package of radical reforms put forward yesterday by university managers to
ensure that quality does not suffer in the wake of university expansion was
welcomed by the government.
Mr Tim Boswell, higher education minister, said he would take 'very
seriously' the proposals for students to be given vouchers to pay for
education wherever they wished and for universities to be paid according to
units of education they provided to students.
Other recommendations on the agenda are a new vocational 'associate degree',
which could be a stepping stone to a full honours degree, and a national
system of academic credits. This would be transferable from one university
to another, and backed by a uniform national credit 'transcript', in which
standardised details of students' performance would be entered regularly.
The reforms have been proposed by the Higher Education Quality Council, a
group set up by university vice-chancellors with government backing. It said
they were essential if the UK higher education system was to adapt to modern
needs.
Over the past five years, the proportion of 18-year-olds going to university
has doubled, while the number of mature students has also increased.
Without reform, the system could not accommodate students taking career
breaks or combining a career with their degree, the council said.
Professor Peter Toyne, vice-chancellor of Liverpool John Moores University
and chairman of the council's credit and access group, said: 'We are at an
important point in history where we are struggling to keep a system afloat
which is based on past assumptions. If it's going to go further forward,
reform has got to be radical.'
Mr Boswell said the plan for transferable academic credits was in line with
the government's higher education charter. He promised that both the
government and the higher education funding councils would take the funding
proposals 'very seriously'.
He also ordered a report from the Higher Education Quality Council into
growing unease that franchising arrangements used by universities to allow
foreign colleges to award their degrees might have diluted standards.
Mr Boswell said: 'There must be no reduction in standards.'
The council will consult universities and employers on the report until
September 30 this year, with a further report due by the end of the year.

FT  14 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Amstrad
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Viglen acquisition is the latest and clearest expression of Amstrad's
new strategy. Gone are the days of piling gadgetry high and selling it
cheap, which made chairman Mr Alan Sugar famous. Margins on that business
are wafer thin. Instead, the group is using its cash to acquire companies in
higher margin niche markets. One of the attractions of Viglen is that it
supplies personal computers direct to customers, cutting out middle men.
Simultaneously Amstrad is turning itself into a holding company. There are
so far four divisions: its original consumer electronics business; Betacom;
Dancall, bought last year; and now Viglen. Further acquisitions seem
probable given that Amstrad will still have cash after paying for Viglen.
Viglen looks like a risky purchase. Though its executives have built it into
a well-regarded business, their golden handcuffs will last only three and a
half years. It is hard to see what competitive advantage Viglen will retain,
if and when they leave. Nor is it obvious that Mr Sugar's proven skills as a
mass marketeer can add much to a niche player like Viglen. His personal
involvement is less important than it was. The implementation of the new
strategy will largely depend on the business acumen of Mr David Rodgers, due
to join as chief executive in August and about whom the stock market so far
knows little.

FT  14 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Salvesen
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Christian Salvesen's 27 per cent fall against the market since January's
profits warning looks overdone in the context of a fall of just 2 per cent
in annual profits. It might thus be seen as an example of how the market
over-reacts to the kind of prompt trading statement now being urged by the
stock exchange in situations where traders' expectations lose touch with
reality. But the January statement highlighted difficulties with the Aggreko
plant hire business, which was supposed to be an important engine of
longer-term growth. Since Salvesen is now determined to focus on Aggreko's
margins rather than volume growth, the market's response is more
understandable. As a specialised business, Aggreko might generate high
quality earnings, but that would not warrant a premium rating. Salvesen's
present multiple of 13 times earnings does not make the shares particularly
cheap.
Salvesen may feel bruised by the market's reaction to its statement, but a
re-rating was inevitable given investors' changing perception of long-term
growth prospects. Certainly yesterday's statement held out little promise of
a rapid rebound in earnings despite the improving economic climate. The
Swift industrial distribution business has made a promising start, but its
profit base is relatively small. Having chosen to renegotiate its complex
arrangement with Marks &amp; Spencer at a time when interest rates are low,
Salvesen can no longer look forward to the benefit of rising rates.
Management would describe the renegotiation of this archaic arrangement as
good housekeeping. Quite so, but it will need more than that to out-perform.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
On the surface, profits notched-up by stock exchange member firms last year
look respectable enough. If 1993 proves to be a year of peak profits,
though, a 20 per cent pre-tax return on capital is hardly an adequate
compensation for the risks. The market has recorded one year of aggregate
losses and three years of single-figure returns on capital in the last five.
Even if hurdle rates are being reduced in response to lower inflation,
investors would normally demand more from such a volatile business.
True, the overall numbers can be misleading. Around 15 to 20 per cent of
firms are likely to make losses even when the market is booming, which
depresses the aggregate return. There is a wide spread of performance
between small private client stockbrokers and the biggest integrated firms.
But given the weak performance of equity markets this year, most firms will
be hard pressed to match their 1993 performance. Dealing profits, which
account for the biggest swings in revenue, will be especially hard to come
by.
It is difficult to judge whether London is notably more or less profitable
than other markets. On a broadly comparable basis, New York Stock Exchange
firms made a 17 per cent return on capital last year. Yet profitability in
the previous two years appears to have been higher than achieved in London.
The danger must be that London firms allow their costs - especially staff
costs, which account for almost half the total - to be set in markets which
can better afford to pay.

FT  14 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Fiscal fears
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It would be dangerous to read too much into yesterday's steep falls in UK
equities and gilts, given the low trading volume in both markets. Financial
markets have a lot to contend with just the same. Not only have the
disappointing results for the government in the Euro-elections given rise to
demands for tax cuts, there is growing unease on the inflation front, too.
The latest producer price figures look fine as far as output prices are
concerned. Input prices, however, have stopped falling on a year-on-year
basis, which is bound to add to nervousness ahead of tomorrow's average
earnings figures.
Since November's budget, the policy balance has involved a combination of
relative fiscal tightness with monetary looseness. The political temptation
now might be to alter that mix, especially since growth looks set to keep
the public sector borrowing requirement moving downwards. Presumably more
votes are to be gained by scrapping the next increase in VAT on fuel than
would be lost by raising base rates, especially given the proportion of
voters who either have fixed rate mortgages or still depend for income on
building society deposit accounts.
This week's Mansion House speech may yield some clue about the chancellor's
thinking. Given present funding difficulties, the gilts market would
probably respond badly to a softer line on taxes. In theory, higher economic
growth means equities should have less to fear. But what would be billed as
tax cuts might simply be tax increases foregone, while evidence of another
volte-face by a beleaguered government would hardly instil confidence in any
market.

FT  14 JUN 94 / Warning against direct controls on derivatives: BIS backs
better disclosure by firms to reduce risks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BASLE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Market-friendly methods, rather than direct controls, should be used to
regulate derivative financial products, the Bank for International
Settlements urged at its annual meeting in Basle yesterday.
The BIS, an international organisation that promotes co-operation among
central banks, said improved disclosure by individual firms, capital
adequacy standards that relate to market risk, and improved settlement
systems were the key to controlling the potential risks caused by derivative
instruments.
In its survey of world economic conditions, the BIS suggests that the US
Federal Reserve may have been too slow to increase interest rates. 'It could
plausibly be argued that keeping real policy-influenced interest rates
negative for too long risked contributing to a build-up of inflation.' The
Fed has recently moved towards a 'neutral' interest rate policy.
The BIS, in its annual report, says - as did the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development last week - that the solution to high
unemployment is to make the labour market more flexible.
Its emphasis on derivatives follows fears that the complexity and scale of
markets in derivatives, such as futures and options, might lead to growing
financial instability and so-called systemic risk - the danger that the
failure of a market participant might cause a meltdown of the financial
system.
Some government officials believe that the use of derivatives may have
compounded the decline in world bond markets that followed the increase in
US interest rates on February 4. In the US, the General Accounting Office
last month issued a report calling for legislation on the use of
derivatives.
But Mr Andrew Crockett, the BIS general manager, said: 'It would be a
mistake to assume that policymaking would be easier if financial instruments
could be limited or capital movements controlled.
'Global markets are now so highly integrated that suppressing the symptoms
of investor preferences in one market would simply lead to their
manifestation elsewhere.'
Although the BIS report says the 'potential for instability in these markets
is extremely high', it suggests that by strengthening disclosure and
internal controls, market participants can be protected from their own
mistakes.
Mr Wim Duisenberg, BIS president, told the meeting it was important to
strengthen the resilience of individual financial institutions.
'Promoting a sharper awareness of risks on the part of market participants
and encouraging the adoption of internal risk-management procedures suited
to the new environment are two such examples,' he said.

FT  14 JUN 94 / Personal View: Can aid buy Palestinian peace?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL DORON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Even before the Israel-Palestine Liberation Organisation accord on the
principles for peace negotiations was concluded, the US and European
countries rushed to offer massive economic assistance to the nascent
Palestinian autonomous entity. It is gratifying that policy makers realise,
at last, that economic growth is vital to the success of the peace process.
Yet it is also to be feared that this aid will not only be wasted, but may
even increase political rivalries in an already fractious Palestinian
society.
There are signs that donor countries are aware of the risks involved in
funnelling massive aid through the PLO, an organisation that has hardly
excelled in managing its own considerable treasure. However, concern about
how efficiently aid will be used, albeit important, misses the more
fundamental issue: the impact any large amount of aid, however well
administered, is likely to have on the politics and society of recipients.
Massive aid inflates an anti-productive public sector and inflames political
competition for the resources it makes available. In the Middle East - where
statism already exacts a high economic toll even in such wealthy countries
as Saudi-Arabia, and where politics are not blessed by moderation - large
amounts of aid tend to have grave repercussions.
It is encouraging that the World Bank, which was put in charge of
implementing the aid from western governments to the Palestinians, has
endorsed reliance on markets and private initiative. It also seems
determined to provide aid only for infrastructure development, such as
roads, water purification and sewage systems.
Western recognition of the dangers inherent in aid was underscored by the
British foreign secretary, Douglas Hurd, at a recent London conference. He
asserted that donor nations were determined not to repeat the mistakes of
the past. They will do all they can, he claimed, to ensure that aid promotes
private sector initiative.
Such sentiments are good news, so far as they go. But the World Bank will
have to struggle against the grain of most European bureaucracies if it is
to translate its good intentions into effective policy. Unfortunately, these
bureaucracies are inclined to encourage political meddling in the economy,
ostensibly to correct market failures. Their encouragement of a dominant
public sector may pose a real danger to the economic success of the
autonomous entity - and, ultimately, to the peace process.
Furthermore, worries remain not just about how the aid will be used, but
about its size. The fledgling Palestinian administration could easily be
overwhelmed by the political results of a flood of easy money.
The economic agreement reached between Israel and the PLO in Paris does seem
to offer a promising opportunity for private sector development. It posits
open borders between the parties and should facilitate a fair degree of
movement of people and goods among them.
Nevertheless, beneficial co-operation cannot materialise without structural
reforms in Israel's own economy. Since Israeli markets are highly regulated
and dominated by powerful monopolies and oligopolies, which render market
access difficult even for small, or newly formed Israeli enterprises,
freedom of access granted to the Palestinians will not be as beneficial as
hoped. Worse still, this agreement may encourage Palestinian Arabs to adopt
economic institutions similar to those prevailing in Israel.
The Israeli economy has long been managed by a cabal of economists and
bureaucrats, along with their 'private' sector associates, who think they
know everything. They control market forces because they are determined to
bend them to the service of ephemeral 'national goals' or to 'correct'
market failures or avoid 'unconscionable' profits by speculators. The
unfortunate results include a banking system that has had to be bailed out
by the government and a decade of stagnation of output per head. Palestinian
economists could easily contract the same hubris, with worse consequences.
The balance between the forces that can promote and undermine the peace
process is delicate and volatile. Manageable quantities of economic aid,
focused on building basic infrastructure, along with limited emergency aid
to alleviate the plight of the unemployed, would encourage those supporting
peace.
Western governments and their aid agencies must, however, guard against the
political manipulation of aid, which could undermine growth and destabilise
Palestinian Arab society. It would do so by encouraging rivalries between
competing factions and promoting corruption and nepotism. This is, in turn,
likely to exacerbate radicalism and militant fundamentalism, so frustrating
all hope for peace in the near future.

FT  14 JUN 94 / Hunters look for choicest morsels: With fee income static,
UK accountancy firms may have to make big changes in strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stagnant revenues, job cuts, growing competition: the latest snapshot of
trends affecting the UK's leading accountancy firms highlights the
likelihood of a widespread restructuring in the profession.
Data from the top 30 firms published last week reveals total fee income of
Pounds 3.4bn was all but static in 1993-94 compared with the previous year.
Half of the top firms reported a decline in revenues, including Touche Ross,
one of so-called 'big six' firms, which fell 0.8 per cent to Pounds 332.9m,
taking it from fifth to sixth place in the accountancy league table.
'It's been a very, very difficult year,' says Mr Nick Land, managing partner
of Ernst &amp; Young, which dropped from third to fourth place despite raising
fee income 3.8 per cent to Pounds 388.4m. 'It's still very hard out there. A
lot of my managers are very cautious looking forward. It's very
competitive.'
The gloom might have been worse without the counter-cyclical income from
insolvency work. Economic recovery is now cutting that source of revenue but
has not yet proved sufficiently strong to ensure a return to the high growth
rates in audit fees that the firms experienced in the late 1980s.
Faced with these pressures, in the past two years accountancy firms have
begun cutting jobs and other overheads. The number of partners has dropped
by 7 per cent in the past 12 months and the number of other professional
staff whose work is charged to clients by 6 per cent.
'I think all the firms have more cuts to make,' says Mr Ian Brindle, senior
partner of Price Waterhouse, which dropped from fourth to fifth place after
reporting almost unchanged revenues of Pounds 384.6m for 1993-94.
In spite of such pessimism, the figures do not tell the whole story and have
to be read with caution. The firms only reveal the gross revenues received
from clients. As partnerships they are not obliged by law to reveal their
profits or losses, and currently they have no intention of waiving this
right.
It is also difficult to make comparisons between firms, given the different
ways in which the information is collected and the growing diversification
in the activities of the firms which has reduced the areas in which they are
direct competitors.
In particular, some of the larger firms argue that there is a glaring
difference between themselves and Andersen, which comprises Arthur Andersen
and Andersen Consulting, and which has jumped in the past two years from
sixth to third position in the league table, with total fee income of Pounds
433.6m in 1993-94.
Much of Andersen's income comes from its management consulting work and from
'out-sourcing' - the process of taking over and running contract functions
such as computer, accounting and tax work that clients would previously have
run in-house.
Mr Peter Smith, chairman of Coopers &amp; Lybrand, unchallenged as the UK's
largest firm with revenues of Pounds 560m, hints at a widespread feeling
that Andersen should be seen as in a different sort of business: 'I don't
see that it makes sense to aggregate high-level intellectually-based
consulting services with hangers full of people running computers.'
Andersen has been successful in exploiting the markets that rivals such as
Price Waterhouse attempted to emulate to its cost during the late 1980s with
a consulting arm that subsequently had to be restructured with substantial
job losses. 'Let them (other firms) say whatever they want,' counters Mr Jim
Wadia, Arthur Andersen's managing partner. 'We want to grow and succeed.'
Part of Andersen's success is due to its ability to control overheads, the
premium it pays to recruit the best graduates, the provision of high-quality
training, and good management information systems.
Other large accountancy firms are considering similar methods to boost their
profitability. But if Andersen's rivals believe the prospects are as gloomy
as they make out, they also face a number of strategic choices: whether to
continue offering a broad range of professional services or to specialise in
just a few; whether to offer high-fee advisory services or high-volume
'outsourcing' and similar products; and whether to serve a wide group of
clients or focus on particular industrial sectors.
Mr David Maister, a US-based consultant to professional firms such as
accountants and lawyers, likens the large firms during the 1980s to the
'hunter-gatherers' of nomadic tribes, always roaming for new products.
'Everyone's job was to hunt buffalo, but when they saw a goose they thought
'just kill meat whatever it is'.' If one firm started offering a new
service, the others felt they had to follow.
This approach worked when volumes were growing rapidly, but there was little
attention to longer-term strategy or the costs being built into operations.
In the 1990s, Mr Maister warns that clients are becoming more cost conscious
and more critical of services the firms provide.
There is evidence that some firms are beginning to respond to such
pressures. At KPMG Peat Marwick, the second largest firm with income of
Pounds 497.6m last year, Mr Colin Sharman, senior partner, says: 'You can
see quite clear differences emerging between the firms. We will focus more
on the core services of audit, corporate finance and recovery (including
insolvency and company restructuring), tax and business transformation
consulting. We want to be seen as advisers.'
KPMG has restructured the firm around teams of professionals with a range of
skills serving particular industry sectors, rather than organised along
traditional lines such as tax and consulting. Coopers is also in the middle
of a wide-ranging re-organisation around industry groupings.
Mr Sharman predicts that several of his large rivals, including Touche and
Andersen, will offer a broader range of services such as out-sourcing, which
may offer lower margins but which, because of the high volumes, can also be
profitable if managed well.
Mr Maister predicts that one of the large accountancy firms may within the
next few years abandon auditing, while another firm specialises in nothing
else to provide highest quality. 'Audit is low growth, low fee and brings a
high risk of litigation,' he says.
Mr Sharman is sceptical, however, pointing out that the statutory audit each
year of British companies provides a launching pad from which firms can sell
other services to the client. 'It's too much of an annuity stream to give
up,' he says.
While decisions about strategy are important for larger firms, they are
still more pressing for their medium-sized rivals. The past few years have
witnessed growing consolidation of the profession. Of the income generated
by the top 30 firms, the 'big six' alone take 76 per cent.
While there will probably always be scope for small high-street
practitioners, there is a question-mark over the viability of 15
middle-ranking firms. Mr David McDonnell, managing partner of Grant
Thornton, the seventh-largest UK firm, says: 'The current position is not
sustainable. The 'big six' may become five or four but the next tier will
reduce to maybe three or four firms within a few years.'
The answer, he argues, is to specialise. The costs of remaining generalist
providers will make mid-size firms' fees uncompetitive with smaller, high
street rivals which have lower overheads and concentrate on a few basic
services. Grant Thornton, for instance, has abandoned much of its work for
larger clients, and is specialising in offering general business advice to
fast growing companies.
Other mid-size firms may either fold, or be forced to merge: either with
each other, or - for the handful that still have large clients - with a big
firm. One of the last of these - the combination of BDO Binder Hamlyn, the
eighth-largest firm, with Andersen - is likely to be completed over the
summer, in a move which will probably propel it to second place in the
league table next year.
Like, their larger counterparts, mid-size accountancy firms, are having to
come to terms with the prospect of much more sluggish growth in the 1990s
than they experienced in the past decade. This presents a particular
challenge to the current generation of senior partners across the
accountancy sector who have been used to management in periods of high
growth, and only in recent years have faced stagnation. As Mr McDonnell of
Grant Thornton says: 'We will have to adjust to the difficulty of operating
for the long-term in a low-inflation, low-growth economy'.

Meanwhile, another little environmental tiff seems to have been patched up
at last. Britain's environment secretary John Gummer was seen walking
arm-in-arm into an Oslo hotel yesterday with his Norwegian counterpart,
Thorbjoern Berntsen. Berntsen, it may be remembered, was the man who told a
Norwegian election rally last August that Gummer was 'the biggest drittsekk
I have met in my life'.
Attending a two-day international meeting to sign a UN deal on curbing acid
rain, Gummer told reporters that he had no hard feelings - both were good
friends again. Fortunately for Berntsen, the Norwegian electorate was spared
the picture of him cuddling up to Norway's number one environmental enemy.
Conveniently, the state-owned TV and radio network was on strike yesterday.

The recent Gatt symposium in Geneva on conflicts between free trade and
environmental protection was purring along peacefully until Philippe Sands,
a young shirt-sleeved legal type, mischievously provoked Richard Eglin,
director of Gatt's Trade and Environment division.
Sands, founder of London University's Foundation for International Law and
Development, started annoying Eglin by quoting ebulliently from a
much-leaked Gatt panel ruling on a dispute between US and Mexico over the
harm that tuna fishing can cause to dolphins. Eglin, normally a suave,
unflappable sort, responded that he 'can't see why people accuse us of lack
of transparency - this hall leaks like a sieve'.
However, rather than quit while he was ahead, Sands kept on prodding Eglin
and the 300-odd delegates to think of an exception to his strongly held
belief that most pollution crossed national borders.
Eglin offered 'noise pollution' as an example. Sands nodded at the truth of
this; but it gradually began to dawn on him - along with everyone else -
that the remark might have been directed at him.

Democrat' candidate polled a mammoth 10,000 votes. It highlights the wisdom
of the party's policy of earmarking an extra 1p on income tax for spending
on education.

Amazing things these computer spell-checkers. David Burns, a London-based
banker who does business in Spain, reports that his checker suggested
'bozos' was a better way of spelling bonos, the Madrid government's volatile
bonds. It also recommended that IRPF, the acronym for Spain's swingeing
income tax, should be rendered 'irrupt'.
Burns then keyed in (Mario) Conde, the disgraced financier who was removed
from the chairmanship of Banesto by the Bank of Spain. The machine thought
'conned' a reasonable alternative. (Luis) Valls, the distinguished chairman
of the profitable Banco Popular, came up as 'value'.
For the IU, the Communist party's Izquierda Unida coalition which campaigns
for greater public spending, the checker proposed 'IOU'. The Catalan
nationalist coalition CIU, the power-broker in Spain's hung parliament,
flashed up as 'CIA'.
Clearly the machine has inbuilt anti-Spanish sentiments. El Pais, one of the
top newspapers, it regards as 'El Pain'.

FT  14 JUN 94 / Observer: Salad days are over
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There's no such thing as a free lunch in banking any more. Nowhere is this
more true than at Merrill Lynch in New York where the firm has suddenly
stopped paying for its traders to be fed at lunchtime.
The giant securities firm used to pick up the Dollars 5.45 lunch tab in the
hope that it would keep its traders working at their desks all day long.
However, Merrill has told its traders that from now on they must pay for
their own sandwiches and salads during the lunch-hour.
Merrill refuses to disclose how much it will save, but analysts put the
figure at no more than Dollars 500,000 a year - small change for a firm
which made bumper profits of Dollars 1.4bn last year. So could the decision
to stop underwriting the traders' lunch bills have more to do with physical
 -rather than financial - belt-tightening?

FT  14 JUN 94 / Leading Article: Councils and the Concorde fallacy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Concorde fallacy is the name given to the belief that it is a waste of
money to pull the plug on a project once you have invested a lot in it. The
Anglo-French supersonic aircraft swallowed huge sums of public money long
after it became clear that it would never yield a profit. Local government
reorganisation in England has become the political equivalent of the
fallacy, with the government unwilling to stop a process that can only
increase its unpopularity.
The government has contracted out the process to a quango, the Local
Government Commission chaired by Sir John Banham. It hoped to see the
present two-tier structure of local government outside the big cities
replaced with single-tier unitary authorities. The commission would do the
legwork, producing proposals for each area tailored to local needs.
Unfortunately it has not been that simple. The commission has produced
widely differing proposals, ranging from no change to complicated
permutations of unitary and two-tier authorities. Some of the commission's
recommendations have been welcomed. The restoration of tiny Rutland,
swallowed by Leicestershire in 1974, has gladdened the hearts of the 33,000
residents even though it could add as much as Pounds 125 a year to their
council tax bills.
But proposals that involve abolishing or shrinking historic shire counties
have produced intense opposition. Business fears that it will have to deal
with a multiplicity of authorities that are too small to think
strategically. MPs and councillors feel that the abolition of counties with
records for modestly efficient administration is unlikely to improve the
quality of local government.
Heavyweight support
Opponents of reorganisation have received heavyweight support from a recent
Audit Commission report on the likely costs. The local authority watchdog
warned that new authorities might inherit depleted reserves and high
spending commitments. During the 1974 reorganisation of local government,
the building of new municipal swimming pools ran at three times the normal
annual level. Councils facing abolition find the spending of reserves on
tangible memorials irresistible.
The form of the reorganisation might have been designed to increase costs.
Where unitary authorities are created, each must employ managers to deliver
the services previously provided by a single county - instead of one
education director, there will be several. And since most of the new unitary
authorities will be larger than existing districts, merger costs will be
substantial. There is unlikely to be much change left out of Pounds 1bn for
the costs of the shake-up. Since reorganisation will happen in the run-up to
the next general election, backbench MPs fear that they will pay the price.
Put on ice
Reorganisation also threatens attempts to improve the management of local
services, according to the Audit Commission. Managers are already devoting
their time to chasing top posts after reorganisation. Policies such as
compulsory competitive tendering - responsible for improving the efficiency
and effectiveness of local services - are being put on ice during the
transition.
Local government needs to be able to act strategically, deliver local
services responsively and be locally accountable. A two-tier structure is
the best way to achieve this, with larger strategic county councils and
smaller districts to provide services. The single-tier authorities emerging
from the Banham commission seem too large to be truly local. Yet they will
be too small to handle strategic functions which will have to be passed to
joint boards and quangos. The outcome will be more bureaucracy and less
accountability.
It will not be easy for the government to call a halt to local government
reorganisation. Opportunities to do this at an earlier stage were foolishly
rejected last year. Now even more political capital has been sunk in the
project. There is a case for unitary status for a few larger cities such as
Leicester and Bristol and for abolishing unpopular new counties such as Avon
and Cleveland. But in the rest of the country, scrapping reorganisation
would produce a huge cheer and a welcome setback for the Concorde fallacy.

FT  14 JUN 94 / Leading Article: New patterns in Europe
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Anyone who points out that the so-called European elections are in reality
no more than 12 separate national opinion polls almost invariably goes on to
deduce some Europe-wide pattern or moral from their results. This time even
the almost universal expectation, that voters would use the occasion to
express disgust with their incumbent governments, proved only very patchily
true. But something like a general law on that point can be deduced, namely
that governments do worst when elections are genuinely mid-term. The nearer
voters are to a general election, whether behind or in front, the more
indulgent they may be towards governing parties, presumably because they are
thinking harder about the alternative.
Thus while the Spanish electorate no longer felt any obligation to stand by
its year-old support for the scandal-ridden Socialists, Greek and Italian
voters did re-endorse their more recently elected governments (of left and
right respectively), while German voters gave a sharp warning to the
opposition Social Democrats not to count on a general election victory in
October. The Luxembourg government found the ideal solution: it held its
general election on the same day as the European one, and did handsomely in
both.
If all member states followed that example the European election would get
less media coverage, but more people would vote in it; and it would be a
striking affirmation of European unity, since all EU citizens would be
choosing their national parliaments on the same day. But national
governments would probably find it even more difficult to synchronise their
political calendars than to agree on a single European time zone, or indeed
a single currency. Other ways of imparting a sense of common destiny to the
peoples of Europe need to be found. One of the more obvious, prescribed in
the Treaty of Rome but still not implemented, would be to elect the European
parliament on an EU-wide system.
Proportional system
That would of course have to be a proportional system, which is why the
Conservative party has resolutely resisted it for mainland Britain (even
while imposing it on Northern Ireland lest the Catholic population go
unrepresented). Reduced today to 18 MEPs, and only one north of the Wash,
that party should now realise the error of its ways.
The argument that PR for Europe would be the thin edge for Westminster is
bogus - unless one expects the European parliament to produce a disciplined
majority for a single-minded European government, which is not exactly
Conservative policy. The actual purpose of the European parliament is to
reflect the different strands of public opinion throughout the EU. By
sticking to a single-member system, which gets less proportional as
constituencies get larger, the UK ensures that this reflection is seriously
distorted - in the present case giving the dominant Socialists an artificial
boost to offset the net loss they suffered in terms of votes.
Federalist vision
In the Union-wide popular vote, these elections were in fact a victory for
the moderate right. The far right was happily defeated in Germany, and fell
back slightly in both France and Italy. The European People's party
(Christian Democrats and allies) did well in Spain, where it benefited from
Mr Gonzalez's decline, and in the successor states of the Holy Roman Empire
 -Germany and Benelux, to which one might add Austria, where the referendum
result was above all a triumph for Mr Alois Mock. This central core of
Europe, it seems, is still wedded to a federalist vision, while in France
and Italy conservatives of a more Euro-sceptic bent are on the rise.
When all that is said, the difference between the results in the UK and
Germany remains striking. Both countries have been piloted through gruelling
recessions by conservative leaders who have taken a battering from both
media and opinion polls, not least for their alleged willingness to
sacrifice national interests and sovereignty on the altar of Maastricht. But
while John Major has tried desperately to appease the Euro-sceptic wing of
his party, Helmut Kohl has ploughed resolutely on, tirelessly inciting his
countrymen to lift their eyes from the small print and remember how much is
at stake in the success of the European enterprise. The results speak for
themselves.

FT  14 JUN 94 / The FT Interview: Generation game winner - Peter Wallenberg
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW GOWERS, HUGH CARNEGY and CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Peter Wallenberg, patriarch of the fourth generation of one of Europe's
mightiest in-dustrial families, has the battered but exhilarated air of
someone who has just been on a particularly bone-shaking fairground ride.
With good reason. Not only has he steered his empire - a network of holdings
that comprises almost every well-known name in Swedish industry, including
Astra, Asea, Electrolux, Ericsson, Saab-Scania and Stora - through Sweden's
worst recession since the 1930s. He has also, contrary to widespread
expectations, emerged more dominant than ever in Swedish business.
Mr Wallenberg, a gruff, rumpled figure with an impish sense of humour, can
afford a little self-congratulation in talking about his recent ordeal: 'You
can ask my colleagues and they will say: 'You smell trouble long before
anybody else'.'
Nevertheless, he remains acutely sensitive about the perception that the
industrial edifice he has controlled for the past 12 years was almost
brought down by recession. Frequently in the past 18 months commentators
questioned whether a domain that stretches from forestry through engineering
and motor manufacturing to telecommunications and pharmaceuticals could
survive shrinking markets and piles of debt.
Mr Wallenberg, now 68, does not deny that the recession 'put the whole
organisation to a very tough test'. It was, he says, 'the sort of experience
when, really, your heart goes down very far in your body at an early stage
and you live with that until you work your way out of it'.
An important turning point came with the flotation and heavy devaluation of
the Swedish krona in November 1992. The steady slide in interest rates and
the export lift that followed provided a vital lifeline - not least to
Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, Sweden's premier bank and the Wallenbergs'
financial flagship that only a year ago was on the brink of a state
takeover.
Mr Wallenberg prefers to stress the toughness and ingenuity of his senior
managers in pulling the companies he controls out of the mire. Investor, the
family's chief investment vehicle which controls most of the Wallenberg
blue-chips, managed to scale down a threatening level of debt through some
deft divestments, while preserving control of its prize assets.
'The reserves in Investor proved more than adequate without selling off any
single major holding,' he declares. Nor, he insists, is any such big
sell-off contemplated now. The family still controls as much as 40 per cent
of the Stockholm stock market through companies which boast total annual
sales of SKr450bn (Pounds 38bn).
More than that, the dynasty's dominance has been enhanced by recent
developments at Volvo, a company that in the past provided a genuine
counterweight to the Wallenberg empire. After the collapse of its plan to
merge with France's Renault and the departure of chairman Pehr Gyllenhammar,
Volvo is selling all its non-core interests to concentrate on making cars,
trucks and buses. One large subsidiary has already been sold - to the
Wallenbergs - and two top Wallenberg men have been appointed to the Volvo
board.
Needless to say, the kind of shareholder revolt that humbled Mr Gyllenhammar
would be hard to imagine with the Wallenbergs. A system of weighted shares,
where one class of share has much greater voting power than the second, is
the cement that has bound the empire together and fended off the threat of
foreign takeover. The structure, at its most extreme, allows Wallenberg
companies to control 94.1 per cent of the votes in Electrolux, the world's
leading white goods maker, with just 6.4 per cent of the capital.
Mr Wallenberg is quite unrepentant about this system. Nor does he seem
worried now that it faces any legislative threat, either within Sweden or
from the European Union. 'All countries in Europe have their way of securing
industries that are of a certain interest to the nation in one way or
another.'
But what about growing assertiveness among minority shareholders, in Sweden
as elsewhere in Europe? Might it not eventually undermine the Wallenbergs'
control? 'Look,' he says, 'the capacity and competence of the majority of
small shareholders to really influence a company in a businesslike manner
might be brought into doubt.'
Equally, he bristles at the suggestion that such dominance as he exercises
might be unhealthy for Sweden, either by limiting competition or by impeding
the growth and capital-raising potential of his companies. The competitive
spur, he insists, comes from the international market, and the companies
positively benefit from the long-term stability of ownership and strength of
reputation that his family brings.
'As long as we perform at least as well or better than other equivalent
industries. . . we will do nothing that will be against the best interests
of the country.'
Questions about industrial logic, he implies, are beside the point against
the overriding objective of maintaining the family inheritance. 'The
alternative is to sell out, pocket the money and do something else. Go
fishing or something.'
Clearly, that is not an option he contemplates. Instead, the strategy now is
to look abroad for expansion because, Mr Wallenberg says, Sweden is a small
and saturated market.
Beyond the present, his biggest preoccupation is passing on a healthy
bequest to the next Wallenberg generation - his son Jacob and his nephew
Marcus, both now in their late 30s and playing senior roles in Investor and
SE-Banken.
It is a subject that appears to weigh heavily on him, not least because of
his own experience: in effect passed over for the top job by his legendary
father Marcus Wallenberg, who publicly deprecated his talents, Peter took
over in 1982 when his father died aged 83 - and then only after his brother
Marc, the appointed heir, had committed suicide.
The current patriarch vows not to subject Jacob and Marcus to such
indignities. But he is not yet ready to hand over and he is setting tough
terms.
'I would dearly love to see the next generation come on. That would make the
fifth generation. But you know what I would hate to see is for any of them
to come to the top positions and fail.' The word 'fail' comes out like an
expletive. 'I am prepared to let these boys (take over) provided they come
out right.'

FT  14 JUN 94 / Hope in a bleak house
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is one comforting ob-servation to offer Britain's Conservatives this
morning. The next general election need not be held until the late spring of
1997. That is nearly three years away. As Lord Wilson might say, 150 weeks
is a long time in politics. Contrary to the impression given by some
headlines, the government did not change last week. Mr Tony Blair is not the
leader of the Labour party, although he is front-runner for that post.
Labour did not sweep to power at Westminster over the weekend, although its
chances of so doing have improved. Mr John Major is to be found in his
office in No 10 Downing Street. The prime minister has the levers of power
in his hands. What he does with them can make a difference. He showed this
yesterday when he put on a confident performance at a press conference
called, cleverly, in the sunny garden of No 10. He is here to stay, he said,
and sounded as if he meant it.
He might be. In Germany chancellor Helmut Kohl seemed doomed a few months
ago. The Social Democrats looked set to take office in October's general
election. The economy is only just beginning to emerge from recession. Yet
on Sunday Mr Kohl's Christian Democrats plus allies attracted some 40 per
cent of the Euro-poll against 32 per cent for the Social Democrats. The
British prime minister's explanation is that the recent experience of most
democracies is the same. Mid-term protests like last Thursday's in Britain
melt away when a general election approaches, as in Germany. Mr Major may be
taking lessons in political sumo wrestling from his friend Helmut. He
appears to be aware that a hard-nosed reshuffle of his cabinet would be a
start.
That said, it is difficult to argue that a Tory resurgence is likely. There
is a feeling around that the Conservatives' time has come, that whatever
they do they are heading for the opposition benches. Their nadir lies ahead,
with a lower point to follow. They have broken a series of worse-than-ever
records: worst local election performance, worst by-election showings and,
in the Euro-elections, worst scores by either of the two largest parties in
a national contest since the Labour debacle of 1983. They are tired,
discredited, and irremediably divided over Europe. How can such a shambles
stand up to the resurgent might of the Labour party?
Perhaps by cutting taxes. The most commonly cited reason for the
government's unpopularity is that it won in 1992 by falsely promising lower
taxation. As the ghastly results of the Euro-elections have come in, some
leading Conservatives have started to talk of a tax cut that would restore
the government's fortunes. There is a small obstacle in the way of such a
strategy. The two Budgets of 1993 planted a long series of voter-repellent
irritation machines in the calendar. In October we will get the insurance
premium tax of 3 per cent, plus an impost of Pounds 5 on domestic and Pounds
10 on foreign flights.
Next April, VAT on domestic heating fuels more than doubles, to 17.5 per
cent. Income tax allowances and mortgage interest relief fall from 20 per
cent to 15 per cent, at a time when the trend in interest rates will
doubtless be upwards. The government is committed to adding 5 per cent per
future Budget, in real terms, to road fuel tax, not to mention a similar 3
per cent on tobacco. It may, however, cut taxes in the November 1995 Budget,
or the following year. Mr Major's attack on beggars during the Euro-election
campaign revealed how ruthless he can be if his or his government's survival
is at stake. Picking our pockets in order to bribe us with our own money
near a general election will not trouble the Conservative conscience next
time. It never has.
It would be wrong, therefore, to assert that the Tories are finished. It is
more fruitful to set out the reasons why so many of us strive to believe
that they are. Forget calculations involving percentages, turnout, swing,
opinion polls and suchlike voodoo. Labour attracted some 600,000 more voters
in last Thursday's Euro-elections than it had in the similar poll in 1989.
The Conservative popular vote was 1.1m down. This might be put down to the
tax increases, in which case Mr Major is right when he says we should wait
for the recovery to percolate through. Alternatively the Tory abstentions,
and the accretion of Labour votes, might indicate a greater depth of feeling
than mere bribery could reach.
Over the past few years, and particularly since Black Wednesday, the
political prospect has been depressing. The government constantly trips over
itself. The opposition has not presented a credible alternative social or
economic strategy. National self-confidence has ebbed away, as the great
institutions, from the monarchy downwards, have been shown to be flawed. The
high tide of Thatcherite triumphalism of 1988 has receded, to reveal an
empty, debris-strewn beach. No political leader has yet been able to shake
us out of this mood, certainly not Mr Neil Kinnock or Mr John Major nor, it
must be acknowledged, Mr John Smith while he was alive.
Suddenly, and perhaps misleadingly, change seems possible. The likely new
leader of the Labour party presents a reassuring face at a time when the
party itself is regarded, in all regions of the country, as less frightening
than it was even two years ago. None of us can tell at this stage whether Mr
Tony Blair can live up to his promise, or whether the party he aspires to
lead will permit him to do so. What does seem clear is that Labour, or
rather Blair-led Labour, seems to offer an end to the bleak management of
Britain that has so dispirited us.
There is doubtless wishful thinking here. Mr Blair, a master of the art of
speaking in a manner that his audience likes to hear, is becoming a screen
upon which voters of all parties may project their hopes. This has nothing
to do with the mundane question of whether he shares this particular
aspiration or that, or could make this or that political dream come true.
His hour has arrived just when people are looking for a reason to be
optimistic. The desperate Tory dingoes, low and mean in their cunning, will
know what to do. They will yelp and bay around him, corner his party, press
Labour to come clean with specific policies and costed proposals so that
they may be torn to shreds. We voters can only watch, and tremble.

FT  14 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: 'Excessively high' returns are sought
for long-term projects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From DAVID MILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The recent debate on dividend payments by UK companies and the
associated issue of whether pressures from the City of London discourage
longer-term investment has generated much heat but limited light. A key
issue in evaluating the efficiency with which resources are allocated in the
UK is assessing whether the returns required by investors for funding
longer-term projects undertaken by industrial and commercial companies are
too high. Assessing those required returns is itself tricky - though
manipulation of various financial market data can be informative. Much
harder is assessing what required returns should be given the time horizon
over which physical investment or R&amp;D expenditure might pay off and the
risks involved.
In an article published in the November 1993 volume of the Economic Journal
I described some research I carried out into whether returns required by the
stock market on longer-term investment by UK companies looked too high. Two
conclusions were reached in that paper. First, the returns required on
projects which did not pay back for five years or so appeared to be very
substantially higher than the returns required on projects which paid off
more quickly (within a year or so). Second, the difference in required
returns appeared to be larger than could easily be warranted on the basis of
risk. The econometric study used data on around 500 medium and large UK
public corporations and covered the 1975-1990 period.
In an area as complex as this, no econometric study could be expected to
settle the issue. But testing hypotheses about the operation of markets by
carefully analysing the historical record offers the only constructive way
forward. On the basis of the little econometric work that exists, there is
worrying evidence that companies in the UK face excessively high required
returns for longer-term projects.

FT  14 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Gaping hole in OECD report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms JANE GOODSIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, David Goodhart's report of the OECD jobs study ('Rejecting the
unthinkable and the unacceptable', June 8) concludes that 'lobby groups will
simply pick out what they want in order to reinforce what they are already
doing.' My concern is that, by removing references to the link between
long-term unemployment and rising levels of crime and drug abuse, the OECD
report leaves a gaping hole in what public services the private sector and
drugs services should be doing.
A number of the submissions to government under the City Challenge programme
included tackling local drug misuse as part of a comprehensive package of
measures to improve local economic well-being. Yet the guidance issued by
the Department of the Environment for the new single regeneration budget
makes no explicit reference to tackling drug misuse. If the government is
serious in its attempts to tackle the economically damaging impact of drug
misuse and associated crime, it must ensure its constituent departments
speak coherently. Tackling drug misuse must be a priority area in the
regeneration budget for the future.
Also, we must expect local economic development agencies and training and
enterprise councils to focus on the deleterious effect of drug misuse in
many areas and particularly among young people. We must see a process begin
whereby those responsible at the local level for training, education and
enterprise development engage in a dialogue with health, criminal justice
and specialist drug services.

FT  14 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Audit burden more likely to increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From A J MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I write to draw your attention to a political con-trick which is being
pulled on small businesses.
The government announced with great gusto a lifting of the audit burden from
small companies. As a chartered accountant with many small company clients,
I have studied the draft legislation and would like to warn the public that
they will not see any significant cut in costs if the legislation goes
through as it stands.
For companies falling in the turnover range of Pounds 90,000 to Pounds
350,000 per annum, the proposed legislation requires the accountant to sign
a new report, replacing the audit report. However, the work required to
enable the accountant to sign the new report will be almost as much as is
currently carried out for an audit of this size of company. As the wording
of the new report introduces new risks for the accountant which have yet to
be tested in the courts, many accountants may feel it necessary to carry out
more work than before.
The Department of Trade and Industry is dealing almost exclusively with the
Auditing Practices Board on this matter. The Auditing Practices Board is
responsible for standards and guidance within the profession on auditing
matters. As such, it is mainly concerned with larger companies and, from
what it has written and said, appears to have little grasp of the practical
implications of the proposed legislation and its effect on small companies.
In its rush to score political points out of this matter, the government has
not allowed sufficient time to ensure that the proposals are workable. The
draft legislation was issued towards the end of May and responses on the
matter were required by June 10. With the Auditing Practices Board behind
the proposals, it seems extremely unlikely that it is going to be altered
before becoming law.
Of course it makes sense to maintain a requirement for small businesses to
involve a chartered accountant in their accounting affairs and it makes
sense to remove unnecessary elements of the accountant's work. However, to
tell small businesses that their burden is being lifted when, in the
fullness of time, they will realise that it is not, is nothing more than a
cheap and nasty political trick.

FT  14 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Strategy needed for UK to compete as
rest of the world does
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From R N BRADFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In general, I totally agree with the arguments presented by Mr Robert
Bischof (Personal View, June 10). The British government's seeming obsession
with labour deregulation and an apparent consequent lower wage cost
advantage, as the latest miraculous route to economic success, is shot
through with flaws typical of the limited thinking of those remote from the
business world. In most manufacturing companies of my acquaintance, direct
labour costs are a relatively small proportion of cost. Purchases - mainly
materials - can be four or five times as high; so if we want to reduce cost,
which area should we attack first?
As Mr Bischof points out, overall productivity is the key to cost efficiency
and effectiveness, involving total effort across a company. But while this
is a highly significant truth, it is in turn part of a broader truth, which
is simply that as a nation we will only sell goods and services that other
people wish to buy. The business orientation needed to address this is
defined by the word marketing, and this, in my opinion, is where as a nation
we have been palpably weak and, with odd notable exceptions, continue to be
so.
My own evidence comes from more than 30 years as line manager, company
director and management consultant, working with companies of literally all
shapes and sizes. And on the broader front, there are signs a-plenty. The
limited horizons of too many of today's boards lead to justified allegations
of short-termism. Hand-wringing continues year in, year out, at our
propensity to invent things only to lose out on commercial exploitation.
Government after government introduces various palliatives, but steadfastly
resolves not to establish the long-term economic strategy that identifies
the key technologies and markets of tomorrow, and then create an environment
that really will help businesses in these areas to grow strong. Cries
off-stage, at this point, of 'interventionism' and worse - to which I would
suggest that it is high time we decided to live in the real world, get out
there and compete as the rest of the world does. The alternative, as may be
inferred from Mr Bischof's article, is to continue the story of persistent
relative decline, led by economically illiterate politicians and businessmen
with an eye to the main (short-term) chance only.

FT  14 JUN 94 / Arts: The acceptable face of the avant-garde - With some
relief, William Packer finds contemporary painting alive and well at the
Serpentine Gallery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JG West's elegant pavilion in Kensington Gardens is now 60 years old. It was
designed as a tea room but served its thirsty public for barely half its
life. It then lay empty and redundant until, in an uncharacteristic fit of
inspiration, the bureaucracies responsible for public order in the Royal
Parks fixed upon a new use for it as a gallery for contemporary art. Under
the aegis of the Arts Council, it re-opened in 1970, at first only for the
summer months. Its scope may have been extended, its facilities improved,
its independence under its own trustees at last established, but, with its
ample daylight and its long windows opening out on to the park, it is still
as pretty and effective a gallery as it is possible to imagine.
What it has done with its privileged opportunity over the years is another
matter. A careful reader of this column will know, for example, that I was
not too keen on the show that Damien Hirst put together only last month, and
was less than impressed by recent offerings from Robert Gober or the
Barclays Young Artists Awards. Only lately a minor government minister, one
Mr Chope, called for the place to be closed down and turned into stables.
As a temporary work of installation art, such a proposal might have its
merits - as even I, or young Mr Hirst perhaps, can see: but really it goes
too far. The fact is that controversy or no controversy, the Serpentine now
attracts some 200,000 visitors a year, which by any measure is remarkable
for a gallery of its size. It is in the nature of the exercise that the more
problematical or outre the exhibition, the more scandalised will be the
attention it attracts, especially in this country, where we are suspicious
enough of art of any kind, let alone Modern Art: shock, shudder, Picasso an
old fraud and all that.
The Serpentine's great virtue is that, with its clean, open galleries and
natural light, it can show work of any kind to its best advantage. The
danger is that if the good can be made to look so marvellous, so the inept
may seem acceptable, the banal interesting, the trivial significant.
It is all a matter of emphasis, and if the Serpentine's programme seems
suddenly to have too narrow a focus and, at the expense of quality, become
too bound up with supposed innovation and all the self-mystifying,
self-justifying blather of the avant-garde, then it is no more than
reasonable for the critic to say so. What is not reasonable is to offer the
jackboot's answer to 'Degenerate Art': close it down and kick it out of
sight.
But the Serpentine may legitimately defend itself on its record overall,
saying that to notice only what is controversial in its programme is itself
a distortion. The point is made and, up to a point, taken by its current
show of British painting. It is well chosen and beautifully hung, giving us
a single and typical work by 35 artists, most of whom have been shown at the
gallery one way or another over the years. The title is a little misleading,
for while all these artists worked on after 1970, and much of the work is
very new, the actual examples of one or two of the artists were done long
before - the Nicholson, indeed, dating from 1929.
But this is to quibble. As a show it does two useful things. First, it
clearly demonstrates that for all the talk of the irrelevance, if not the
actual death of painting, its practice has continued throughout its period
within the established conventions, abstract and figurative, apparently
lively and in good health. And it follows from this that far from working in
a critical vacuum alongside their conceptualist and installationist
contemporaries, younger painters such as Lisa Milroy, Ian Davenport and
Fiona Rae may now be seen within a broader context and a richer tradition.
Certainly their work appears the stronger for it, seen now in such company
as Patrick Caulfield, Bridget Riley, Prunella Clough, John Hoyland or
Gillian Ayres.
It is not true of all of them. Tony Bevan, for example, can hardly live with
Freud or Auerbach, and Mark Wallinger and Richard Hamilton make a fine pair
for triviality and pretension. But the gallery is, for the most part, full
of strong and beautiful things - Victor Willing's odd flapping suit of
clothes, like a suspended carcass, holding its own with Francis Bacon's
seated figure; a deceptively simple and expansive Howard Hodgkin; good
things from Paula Rego, Albert Irvin, Adrian Berg, Lucian Freud, Terry Frost
and many more. Take your pick. Most beautiful of all is the large, new
Prunella Clough, with its dark, smoky surfaces and striated stacks.
But for all these good and positive things, there is yet one caveat to
enter. To go through this work is still to register a sense of the official,
or at least established, art of its period. This show offers us the accepted
face of modern painting, the face that fits. The Serpentine's avant-garde
credentials are safe enough.
Here and Now: British painters at the Serpentine Gallery from 1970 to the
present. Serpentine Gallery, Kensington Gardens W2.

FT  14 JUN 94 / Arts: Domingo's noble savage - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the Bonn Opera programme for Antonio Carlos Gomes's Il Guarany (The
Guarani), there is a photograph of Mario del Monaco, bronzed and naked
except for a loin-cloth, taken in 1949 when he sang the title role in Rio de
Janeiro. Del Monaco's enthusiasm for this four-act opera-ballo was such that
his son vowed to make it more widely known. Now intendant in Bonn,
Gian-Carlo del Monaco has realised his boyhood dream. He persuaded Placido
Domingo to learn the part his father had sung, brought in Sony to record it,
and has helped illuminate a neglected corner of 19th century repertoire.
The first Brazilian composer to achieve international fame, Gomes (1836-96)
won a government scholarship to study in Milan. Il Guarany had a triumphant
premiere at La Scala in 1870 and performances followed in Rio, London and
New York.
As the descendant of a Guarani Indian, Gomes was naturally drawn to Jose de
Alancar's love story of 16th century colonial Brazil. The chief characters
are Peri, a Guarani Indian, and Cecilia, daughter of a Portuguese nobleman.
Their love flourishes despite the prejudice of her father, the treachery of
her Spanish admirer Gonzales and a running conflict with the cannibal Aymore
Indians. In a utopian ending, Peri and Cecilia alone survive to found a
lineage which will reconcile Indians and colonial incomers.
Since the 1930s Il Guarany has enjoyed the status of a Brazilian national
opera - but apart from the setting, there is nothing Brazilian about it.
With a long ballet (heavily cut in Bonn), static choral tableaux and an
Italian libretto, it mixes grand operatic style with the melodic verve of
early Verdi. Gomes gives the same Italianate colouring to the natives as he
does to the Europeans, and is unable to hide a patchwork quality. The work's
appeal lies in its exotic jungle location and the opportunities it provides
for beautiful singing.
The idea of inviting Werner Herzog to stage the German premiere had a
superficial logic - his film Fitzcarraldo is also set in the Amazonian
jungle. However, Herzog has yet to reveal himself as a natural theatre man.
His production, designed by Maurizio Balo and Franz Blumauer, unfolded
within a cavernous frame of rampant undergrowth, and updated the setting to
the early 19th century. The action was static, the choreography lamentable.
On the positive side, a complicated plot came over clearly, and the singers
held centre-stage.
As Peri, Domingo joins a distinguished line of interpreters including Gigli.
And this was vintage Domingo, singing in the language and style that suit
him best. Unrecognisable behind Indian feathered head-dress and facial
markings, his noble savage was thoroughly believable. The part taps his
lyrical and heroic strengths, and found him in full, fluent voice.
Gomes hands all the display arias to the soprano, sung here with clean and
gracious aplomb by Veronica Villaroel. Carlos Alvarez's Gonzales was a lyric
baritone of unmistakable class. Chorus and comprimarios were good, but the
orchestral playing under John Neschling was dull. I enjoyed Il Guarany.
Within the limits of its style, it has charm and vitality. And thanks to
Domingo, the Bonn performances had the atmosphere of a real operatic
occasion.
Last Domingo performance tonight

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Those of us who did not see An Evening With Gary Lineker on stage but did
see BBC1's comedy drama 'Fair Game' on television on Saturday will be
interested to discover how far the BBC production resembles its better known
predecessor when ITV screen their television version tonight (8.30). Both
dramas plait together the twin strands of World Cup football and the
emotional/sexual relationships of a band of onlookers. BBC2 shows the final
episode in Quantum Leap, part of a rich seam of American fantasy which gives
the lie to the common claim that American television only makes crime
series. The central character in Quantum Leap is Sam Beckett who travels
through time, becoming a different person in each episode (9.00). Little
Napoleons sounded like yet another of Channel 4's misconceived series aiming
for something multiracial but merely achieving separatism. However, in the
opening episode Saeed Jaffrey and Norman Beaton were so good as competitive
solicitors who both become councillors that you could forget the race
element altogether (10.00).

FT  14 JUN 94 / Arts: Strange bedfellows at the Royal Court - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN HOYLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Duke of Edinburgh's latest views on poverty add a certain piquancy to
the coupling of the two plays running in tandem at the Royal Court for the
summer. At first glance the pairing of Jim Cartright's Road and Sue
Townsend's The Queen and I, under the thematic yoke of deprivation and
wasted lives, looks tenuous. Each work is so stylised, so individual, that
the association seems as artificial as lumping together King Lear and Run
for Your Wife as a joint exploration of troubled family relationships.
The director is Max Stafford-Clark (whose new company, Out of Joint, has
been touring the plays as its first venture); his theatrical strengths
include intellectual clarity and robust didacticism rather than warmth or
humour. Despite avowed aims at a new populist audience, the resultant work
seems aimed at the twittering classes, lazily stereotyping the monarchy with
the same semi-informed ease with which they distance themselves behind
barriers of correct-sounding cliche from poverty and injustice. Pretty much
the traditional audience for the Royal Court, in fact, a theatre which
Stafford-Clark has officially left but which obviously still exerts a strong
hold.
The FT was the first paper to recognise the thrilling potential of Road in
1986. A riveting promenade production by Simon Curtis conducted the
fearfully hypnotised spectators through a nightmare danse macabre down mean
streets of hopeless squalor. The mad, slightly threatening narrator in this
Under Milk Wood of urban dereliction was Edward Tudor Pole. Now Toby Salaman
buttonholes us with an avuncular twinkle, less a gimlet-eyed ancient mariner
than another boring wedding-guest.
The conventional proscenium-arch production adds an air of contrivance that
makes Cartright's honed obscenities and lyrical laments sound artificial.
Some elements of the play have dated: escape is found in drink and attempted
sex - little emphasis on drugs. But then the accent was always on adults,
aware of the emptiness that faced them, rather than kids still finding out.
The production romps towards cumulative impact, not high-pitched intensity.
It misses out on subtlety, and therefore a dimension that stops us
patronising these losers. Besides compassion, its obverse, disgust, is
present, notably in its depiction of sex as either ugly clumsiness or
manipulative power-play. The performance is summed up by the scene where
bosomy Pam Ferris, hugely blowsy, clambers over an insensibly drunken young
soldier who stirs only to vomit, while she pretends that he is seducing her
('So young . . . Why should you choose me?'). Hilarious physical comedy, but
a world away from the quiet, faded desperation that made it the most moving
moment of the original production.
That Stafford-Clark has little time for pathos is illustrated also by his
direction of The Queen and I, drawn from Sue Townsend's best-seller. There
has reportedly been rewriting on tour; certainly it seems less enjoyable
than the Leicester premiere reviewed here in April by Alastair Macaulay. As
everyone must know by now, the brilliant fantasy exiles the royal family to
a deprived inner-city estate in a newly republican Britain. The book showed
affection as well as satire; the stage version hedges its bets by giving a
call to action, in the form of an alternative Christmas speech, to the Queen
herself; but what was warm-hearted in the book seems mere opportunism on
stage.
Royalists will find little offensive here, possibly because some of the
royal impersonations are so inept. Carole Hayman's Princess Margaret sounds
like Margaret Thatcher and looks like Judith Anderson playing Mrs Danvers in
Rebecca. Out of context, David Howey's Prince Philip would be
unidentifiable. Gillian Hanna is at sea with the Queen Mother. On the other
hand, Doon Mackichan suggests the Diana stoop, slyness and general charisma.
Toby Salaman uses a hamper of make-up to transform his face into a Prince
Charles carnival mask, and suggests the right anguished, teeth-clenched
decency.
Touching neither the fifth-form iconoclasm of Have I Got News for You nor
the juvenile venom of Spitting Image, the writing nevertheless shows a
jumble of styles, from comic-strip zaniness to the old-fashioned agitprop
theatre that my companion greeted with a sigh of exasperated nostalgia when
the Queen and her new neighbours had a final sing-song about necessary
change. I suspected the worst when I heard that the company had been getting
the feel of a Leicester council estate - about as relevant to comedy as
those studies of Jacobean Scotland by American divas who think it will help
them to sing Lucia di Lammermoor. But as if to prove he is no dry, po-faced
old stick, the director has interpolated unnecessary songs, adding to the
impression that a vaguely Brechtian history epic was aimed at. Indeed, the
Good Woman of Szechuan is virtually quoted verbatim by the tough
estate-leader, Vi: 'It ain't possible to be honest and poor.'
There are certainly funny passages: the women's assertiveness class, the
Queen and Di participating, is a lovely idea. All credit to Pam Ferris, who
looks nothing like her but manages a likable portrait of HM as a woman
rather delightedly kicking over the traces and discovering herself. But
without the entertainment value of the book, there is no clear message
either.

FT  14 JUN 94 / Arts: De Keersmaeker's 'Toccata' - Dance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SOPHIE CONSTANTI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In 1988 the American choreographer, Mark Morris, moved to Belgium where he
and his dance group were to spend three predictably-controversial years in
residence at Brussels' Theatre Royal de la Monnaie. Now, his successor at
the Monnaie, Flemish dancemaker, Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker, appears to be
in the throes of a similar creative high. Her latest work, Toccata,
presented at the QEH as part of The Turning World festival, is more solidly
authoritative and eloquent than anything she has shown previously in Britain
over the past decade.
Performed by Rosas, the ensemble which takes its name from one of De
Keersmaeker's earliest works, Toccata is a pellucid marriage of music and
dance in which each form reveals and accentuates essential qualities of the
other. While music has always been the driving force behind her
choreography, De Keersmaeker assiduously spurns any easy relationship
between aural and physical action. Her signature piece, Rosas Danst Rosas,
was a trenchant exercise in mathematically-layered gesture which slashed
against the music of Thierry De Mey and Peter Vermeersh. And in its
repetitive sequences, pared-down motifs and stylistic rigour, it proved a
blueprint for much of her subsequent work.
De Keersmaeker's ability to take absolute control of the way in which she
wants music and dance to interact has led to a reputation for cold
formalism. But Toccata shows her buoyed by a series of contrasting piano
pieces by JS Bach; she quietly engages with, rather than answers, each of
these scores in movement terms.
The work opens with pianist, Jos van Immerseel, playing the toccata (BWV914)
of the title. Behind him, a raised, angular platform slopes down to one
side. On this huge catwalk the five performers (one man, four women) absorb
the music and respond to it in carefully-measured phrases. We watch a woman
lifting her arms and shaping them into a perfect oval. And through this
single action, soberly academic yet dazzling and poignant in effect, De
Keersmaeker invokes an atmosphere of hushed concentration, giving us the
first in a stream of images which cleanse the mind and sharpen the eye.
In the central section, a lighter mood prevails as a two-women, one-man team
play with the French Suite's allemande, gavotte and sarabande. Nothing in De
Keersmaeker's writing is gratuitous, excessive or hackneyed. Likewise, her
dancers address the business of rhythm, locomotion and sculpture without
selling-out to the emotive qualities of Bach's music.
The Turning World festival at the QEH continues with Wim Vandekeybus today
and tomorrow (Box office: 071-928-8800)

FT  14 JUN 94 / People: Millionaire moves on from Fine Decor to find more
fun
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mark Bates, 35, is a finance director in a hurry. Only a year after he
helped Fine Decor, the fast-growing wall coverings group, get its shares
listed on the stock market, he wants a bigger challenge.
Bates, who had worked as a management consultant, joined Fine Decor in 1990
following a management buy-out. 'I started with 40 bin bags cleaning out the
contents of the old chief accountant's office,' says Bates, who took no
holiday in his first year with the company and worked every weekend.
Since then, Fine Decor has been transformed from a fragile MBO to a
successful company with its shares listed on the stock exchange, and
although Bates has been well rewarded - he's a millionaire - he feels that
the job of being finance director is no longer such fun. He leaves the
company in August so that he can devote himself to 'looking for a major
challenge to stretch me to the maximum'.
Harry Morgan, Fine Decor's chief executive, describes Bates' decision to
quit as a 'meeting of minds'. Bates was not a 'wallpaper man' and was
somewhat younger than the rest of the executive team.
David Timmins, 41, finance director of Northamber, the loss-making supplier
of computer hardware and software, takes over from Bates. Nearly half of
Fine Decor's sales are overseas and Timmins has been hired partly for his
overseas experience. Before Northamber, he worked for Micropolis Corp and
Matchbox Toys in the US and Germany.

FT  14 JUN 94 / People: Crosby Homes
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Proof that a good sales technique does work - sometimes. Nick Carter, 32,
has just been made managing director of Crosby Homes (North West), part of
the Berkeley Group.
Not that he has much background in buying land and housebuilding, but his
sales technique so impressed Tony Pidgley, chief executive and joint founder
of the Berkeley Group that Pidgley offered him a job.
Up till then Carter - a graduate of Leeds University with a degree in design
and technology - had been selling Porsche cars at a Guildford showroom, a
number of them to Pidgley and his family. Carter took a job as a land buyer
for Crosby Homes, climbing the rungs until he became the land director for
the north west.
Carter takes over in the north west from David Jackson, 50, the
longest-serving member of the Berkeley Group, who has been appointed
managing director of Crosby Homes (Midlands). He in turn takes over from
Geoff Hutchinson (above), 35, who becomes managing director of Crosby Homes
group, the wholly-owned subsidiary of the Berkeley Group.

FT  14 JUN 94 / Business and the Law: Clearing the way for capital - A look
at a model law to provide the basis for workable secured lending regimes in
eastern Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At the first annual meeting of the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development in Budapest in April 1992, Mr Andre Newburg, the bank's general
counsel, raised a problem which was troubling international banks involved
in financings in central and eastern Europe - how to take effective security
over assets.
A legal framework for secured transactions is essential to creating an
investor friendly climate so vital to the emerging and transitional market
economies of central and eastern Europe.
The absence of workable laws on secured transactions restricts the
availability of finance. Lenders will often only make funds available if
payment is guaranteed by assets of the borrower. But most former communist
states either do not have any rules on secured transactions or have to rely
on rules dating from pre-communist regimes of the 1930s.
The EBRD decided it had to take a lead. Under a former Linklaters &amp; Paines
partner, Mr John Simpson, and a German lawyer, Jan-Hendrik Rover, it set up
a Secured Transactions Project to draft a model law which could be used by
these countries to shape a legal framework for secured lending.
The brief was to produce something which could interface with the current
legal systems of these countries. Since most of these countries' legal
systems have civil law origins, it was not possible simply to lift laws on
secured lending from common law jurisdictions such as England and America.
But, says Mr Simpson, the common law systems seemed to offer the best
features.
'We had to produce quickly something sufficiently simple to be of practical
use which bridged the gap between common and civil law systems, but was not
heavily influenced by any one system and which could be adapted to their own
law. Not so much a model as a template,' he says.
They were helped by an advisory board of 20 lawyers from 15 jurisdictions,
five of them drawn from the former communist countries. By the Bank's third
annual meeting in St Petersburg in April this year the model was ready.
The model law is based on the idea of a single security right (a 'charge')
in respect of all types of things and rights. The distinction between
various traditional types of security rights - such as pledges of moveables,
pledges of rights and mortgages - is merged in one right.
A charge under the model is a property right and not a mere obligation. It
entitles the person receiving security to enforce it by selling the things
and rights taken as security and gives preference over unsecured creditors
in insolvency proceedings.
The model is limited to securing business credits. There is great
flexibility over how the parties can define the debt or debts which are
secured and the things and rights which are given as security. In both cases
they can be described specifically or generally, they can be present or
future, and they can change during the life of the charge.
Under the model, charges should be a matter of public knowledge, with
publicity achieved by requiring registration in a separate charges registry.
Enforcement relies mainly on self-help, with the person holding the charge
being given broad rights to sell the charged property as he feels
appropriate.
To preserve the balance between creditor and debtor, however, the model
gives a right to any interested party to apply to a court for protection and
claim damages from the person enforcing the charge for any loss suffered as
a result of wrongful or abusive enforcement.
Where the charge covers all a commercial enterprise's assets there is a
further remedy of selling the business as a going concern.
The rules on the creation of charges introduces a general distinction
between registered charges, which have to be registered at the charges'
registry, possessory charges for which registration is not required but
where the chargeholder takes and must retain possession of the charged
property, and unpaid vendors' charges which protect suppliers of goods who
want to keep title to the goods.
The model was generally well received in St Petersburg. But now Mr Simpson
and Mr Rover must persuade the former communist countries to use it.
Mr Simpson is optimistic they will. Hungary and Poland have already drafted
secured lending laws which draw heavily on the model. But there are concerns
that some countries with strong civil law traditions will see it as too
influenced by US and English systems and opt for models closer to their own
traditions, such as Germany's and Austria's.
Mr Simpson says it was never the EBRD's intention to impose the model on the
central and eastern European states, so it doesn't matter if a country
decides it wants to omit parts of it.
Although the new Hungarian collateral law draws on the model, it departs
from it in several respects. For example, it opts for a court-run
registration system which can be slow and costly - something the model
sought to avoid. It also does not contain the model's unpaid vendor's charge
designed to protect suppliers who want retention of title to their goods.
'The Hungarians took the view that providing for retention of title was not
a pressing need,' Mr Simpson says. 'That doesn't worry us, because the
important thing is that we are getting a law on secured transactions in
Hungary. The unpaid vendor's charge can always be bolted on later.'
Mr Philip Wood, a partner in London-based international law firm Allen &amp;
Overy who sat on the advisory board, says that, although the model is very
well thought out, it is bound to meet some resistance because 'there is no
doubt it is very pro-creditor'.
Where this approach conflicts with the pre-communist traditions of central
European states, such as Bulgaria, the model is likely to hold few
attractions. In central Asia, where many countries have only rudimentary
secured lending laws or none at all, he thinks most will opt for a
pro-creditor universal security law similar to the model. Russia has already
done so with its 1992 pledge law, he says, and countries like Kazakhstan and
Uzbekistan are showing interest.
The biggest resistance to the model is likely over systems of registration
and enforcement. In general, western countries prefer registration to be a
simple, low-cost administrative act. But in many of the civil law
jurisdictions of the former communist states such registration systems as
exist tend to be court based - which means they are slow, cumbersome and
costly.
The registration system adopted in Russia under the 1992 pledge law is an
example of what can go wrong, Mr Simpson says. Russia's system was based on
the use of existing registries. But when parties came to register security
interests they found many of these registries simply did not exist.
Moreover, the Russian law exacts a registration charge or stamp duty of 3
per cent of the value of the assets secured. 'If the transaction involves a
Dollars 1bn power project, that's a big hit,' he says. 'It just shows that
if you tax any part of the creation of a charge you will make it
unworkable.'
As a result, the EBRD has set out to produce a blueprint for a simple
computerised registration system based on new charges registries set up
specially for the purpose, which Mr Simpson is confident will overcome these
problems. The idea, he says, is to avoid the involvement of the courts so
far as possible.
Likewise with enforcement, he adds. The first thing every lender wants to
know is how he can enforce the charge if things go wrong. In most former
communist states enforcement is done through the courts. But the involvement
of the courts at each stage of the enforcement process would be 'cripplingly
slow', he says.
It is vital that the enforcement rules interface with local insolvency laws,
but they also need to be flexible enough to allow practical enforcement
without court involvement, with the courts acting as long stop to protect
the rights of the parties involved.
Mr Simpson and Mr Rover know the model will not provide solutions to all the
problems of secured lending in central and eastern Europe. They expect to
meet strong resistance on such issues as enforcement and registration. But,
used imaginatively, it should provide the basis for workable secured lending
regimes in the region and, as such, it is a big step in the right direction.

European Court
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UK rules on the protection of employees' rights in the event of companies
changing hands or when collective redundancies take place breached EC law,
the European Court of Justice ruled last week. The Court said the UK had
failed to implement fully relevant EC directives.
The directives related to the safeguarding of employees' rights in the event
of the transfer of a business or collective redundancies. Both placed a duty
on employers to inform and consult representatives of workers affected by a
transfer or redundancies.
The European Commission took the UK to court for failure to implement them
properly by not providing for the designation of employees' representatives
in firms where the employer refused to recognise trade unions.
The UK argued that employers who did not recognise trade unions were not
covered by the obligations in the directives because union recognition in
companies was traditionally based on voluntary recognition.
The Court did not accept that argument. It said the aim of the directives
was to ensure comparable protection for employees' rights in all member
states and to harmonise the costs of such provisions for companies in the
EC. To that end, the directives laid down compulsory obligations on
employers regarding informing and consulting employees' representatives.
The Court found member states had no opportunities under the directives to
restrict the rights of employees to those companies which under national
laws were obliged to have union representation.
Although one of the directives specifically provided for situations in which
companies did not have employees' representatives, the Court said this
provision should not be read in isolation and that its effect was to allow
employees without such representation to be properly informed.
The Court said it was not the intention of the Community legislature to
allow the different legal systems within the EC to accept a situation in
which no employees' representatives were designated since designation was
necessary to ensure compliance with the obligations laid down in the
directive.
The Court was not concerned either by the fact that the directives did not
contain specific provisions requiring member states to designate workers
representatives if there were The directives required member states to take
all the measures necessary to ensure employees were informed and consulted
through their representatives in the event of either a transfer or
collective redundancies. That obligation did not require there to be
specific provisions on the designation of employees' representatives.
Two further claims were made by the Commission. The first was that UK rules
only required the employer to consult with the employees' representatives,
to take into consideration what was said, to reply and give reasons if the
representations were rejected. The obligation under the directives was to
consult representatives with a view to seeking agreement. The UK conceded
its rules did not provide for this.
The second claim was that the sanctions provided for in the national rules
for failure to comply with the obligations to consult and inform were not a
sufficient deterrent for employers.
Under the UK rules any compensation which an employer might have to pay
could be set off against any amounts required to be paid to the employees.
The Court said where a Community directive did not specifically provide any
penalty for an infringement, or where it referred for that purpose to
national laws, the obligations of the member states under the Rome treaty
were to require them to ensure infringements of EC law were penalised under
conditions, both procedural and substantive, which were analogous to those
applicable to infringements of national law of a similar nature and
importance and which, in any event, made the penalty effective,
proportionate and dissuasive. The UK had failed to do that.

FT  14 JUN 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Training at long distance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CD-Rom and cheap personal computers are increasingly providing large
companies with an alternative to formal training through taught courses.
The combination of voice, video, text and graphics allows managers to
interact with the 'computer-tutor' in a way that is proving effective and
popular.
For large organisations the ability to offer staff this so-called 'distance
learning' is also cheap. Managers do not need to be ferried to training
centres and housed. And once the course has been paid for, the company has a
re-usable resource.
Now the opportunity to take advantage of this so-called distance learning is
available to smaller companies. Some CD-Rom-based multimedia management
courses can already be rented through TECs and training colleges.
Business Link Southern Derbyshire is one of several local business support
agencies with titles available for rent on or off site.
One company, Xebec Multi Media Solutions, a Gloucestershire-based company,
is already providing multimedia courses which cover topics such as the
management of tasks, leading teams and business communication.
Its latest title, Money Business I, tackles the crucial question of how
companies keep control of cashflow. Aimed at junior managers, the first
module in the seven-hour course is little more advanced than the early
training videos produced by Video Arts that featured John Cleese and Ronnie
Corbett.
However, later modules within the course show the power of multimedia.
Students change assumptions in cashflow forecasts and look at the
implications of large orders on a company's need for working capital.
At Pounds 1,149, Xebec's Money Business course may not top every company's
shopping list. But training via interactive multimedia systems is forecast
to grow at a rapid rate.

FT  14 JUN 94 / Management (The Growing Business): We have ways of making
you buy - Some bank branches are accused of using unfair pressure to sell
financial products
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The question is normally delicately put. Many small businessmen, in
discussion with their bank managers over loans, are used to being asked
whether they would like some insurance.
The key issue - both for the business executive and agencies trying to
uphold banking standards - is whether the banks are taking unfair advantage
of their influential position and possibly selling customers inappropriate
products.
Behind the controversy are the efforts being made by most of Britain's
high-street banks to step up sales of insurance and pension products to add
to their traditional activities of organising loans and overdrafts.
One man convinced that banks routinely mis-sell insurance products is Bill
Raynes, chairman of the National Federation of Independent Financial
Advisers, and partner in Sheffield-based financial consultancy Raynes Hodder
Davison.
He says banks use 'intimidation, duress and coercion' to pressure customers
into buying financial products that they either do not need or would do
better to buy elsewhere.
Raynes denies he is bashing the banks because they are competitors to the
1,700 firms of financial advisers that his association represents. 'I am
passing on the stories that I hear from my member companies about banks'
activities,' he says.
What cannot be denied is that banks are often in a good position to sell
such products, because of the leading role they play in the lives of many
small businesses dependent on loan finance. In some cases, insurance
protection may be required as part of the procedure for fixing up a loan,
but head office rules decree that they should not overly push their own
products.
In recent months evidence has emerged that banks do sometimes take advantage
of their special position to 'persuade' a customer that a specific
life-product sold by the bank may be advantageous, especially if the bank
has just ostensibly done the customer a good turn by arranging a loan.
Chris Eadie, the deputy banking ombudsman who investigates bank complaints,
says he has looked at a number of cases of alleged mis-selling, involving
both small businesses and individuals. The problem is difficult to quantify
because of a lack of breakdown in the ombudsman's statistics. In 1992-93 the
ombudsman investigated 1,081 complaints of all types, recommending that
banks paid compensation in 36.4 per cent of cases.
The British Bankers' Association, the main UK banking trade body, says there
have been 'a few cases' of mis-selling. The bank managers involved are
mainly 'misguided and over-enthusiastic' rather than malicious, the
association says.
As for individual banks, they deny charges of coercion. National
Westminster, for instance, says its branches are always prepared to quote
for business but 'would never insist' that insurance was arranged through
its own subsidiaries.
One complication is that small businesses may not always wish to complain.
They may feel that money paid for the insurance product is a small price for
favourable treatment.
One small businessman in the north-west of England who says he was in this
difficult position claims the manager at his branch pressed him to take out
two policies arranged through the bank's financial services subsidiary, both
covering ill health. Each time the conversations about insurance came up
when the bank manager was talking about his overdraft. 'I felt I was being
mugged,' he says.
One person prepared to go public with his complaint - although his bank
denies his claim - is Esmond Watson, owner of Middlesbrough-based Cleveland
Camera Company, which runs two photographic shops in north-east England.
Watson says he was told by his manager at Yorkshire Bank that a request for
a Pounds 10,000 addition to his Pounds 50,000 overdraft would be considered
more favourably if he diverted some of the Pounds 6,000 a year going into
his current personal pension to a new pension arranged by the bank.
Watson agreed to put Pounds 2,400 a year into a new pension arranged by
Yorkshire Bank's financial services subsidiary with insurers Clerical
Medical. He cut the annual payment in his existing pension scheme organised
through Allied Dunbar, another insurer, to Pounds 3,600. Because of the
start-up costs of the new pension, the switch is unlikely to have benefited
Watson financially, according to independent financial experts.
Yorkshire Bank says it never put Watson under any pressure and that the
switch was in his best interest. Linking discussions over loans to selling
pensions 'is not part of our policy', the banks says.
In a third case, the owner of a building company in London had become
overdrawn on his Pounds 300,000 overdraft limit and was talking to his
manager at Lloyds Bank about increasing it.
In a letter seen by the Financial Times, the bank told him it would continue
to support him subject to several conditions, one of which involved taking
out Pounds 750,000 worth of insurance covering the possibility of accident
or ill health being suffered by himself or his business partner.
The cover had to be arranged through the bank's financial services
subsidiary. After the businessman complained, the bank dropped the
condition. Lloyds says the stipulation about going through the bank's
financial services subsidiary should not have been made, as the customer
should be allowed choice over such insurance.
Three questions arise for bank customers with a possible grouse:
Is the insurance necessary? (In some cases where loans are being arranged
insurance protection against death or ill health may be in the interests of
both the customer and the bank.)
Is the customer given the chance to shop around? (The bank should make clear
that the customer can choose from other sellers.)
Is the bank being neutral as regards its influential position on loans?
If the answer to any of the three questions is no, the office of the Banking
Ombudsman (071 404 9944) will be eager to hear.

FT  14 JUN 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Campari for accountants -
A look at a NatWest lending checklist
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If a National Westminster bank manager asks you in for Campari, he is not
being sociable. As accountants in Greater Manchester have learnt recently,
it is the acronym used by the UK high street bank for its lending decision
checklist.
Stung by small-business complaints of harsh treatment by banks during the
recession, NatWest decided to try to improve mutual understanding by
explaining itself better.
'Open seminars for small businesses tend to be confrontational,' says Trevor
Adamson, director of the bank's Manchester region. 'We felt we would achieve
more by talking to accountants who act for small businesses.'
To distance the bank further, he persuaded the local society of chartered
accountants and Manchester chamber of commerce and industry to run jointly
four seminars, which NatWest then sponsored as part of Adamson's local
contribution in his year as chamber president.
Campari will never be the same again for the 140 accountants who have
listened to Ian McIlveen's explanation of its meaning.
To McIlveen, who makes regional head office lending decisions for projects
costing more than local branch managers' discretion limits, 'C' is for
character. Only businesses and projects of discernible good character will
get their first tick on the checklist.
'A' is for ability - not just of the management to do what it says it will
do, but also of professional advisers such as the accountant.
'M' is for means - not in terms of money, but the means and resources to run
the business transparently so the bank can keep an eye on its investment. In
particular, whether the business produces regular, up-to-date management
accounts.
'P' is for purpose. There must be a clear reason for seeking money, with
proper goals. This is where McIlveen also makes sure of legality,
environmental considerations and the lender's potential liabilities.
'We like lending to things that are already under way,' he says. This makes
him wary of diversification: a business expanding in familiar territory is
more likely to know how much extra working capital might be needed, or
whether it needs more fixed assets.
'A' is for amount. McIlveen worries more about lending too little than too
much, as it is difficult to lend more for the same thing later. The bank
also wants the customer to be putting something in as evidence of being in
earnest.
'R' is for repayment. 'If we can't tick this, we might as well go home,'
McIlveen says. 'There will be no more open-ended pledges, such as with
overdrafts in the 1980s which never seemed to be reduced.'
Finally, 'I' is for interest, the price the bank is going to charge. Only at
this point is security considered. McIlveen says security is necessary to
reassure the bank's depositors and shareholders, but is not now seen as a
prime requirement in lending.
'If you have to realise security, it costs so much to get your money back
you lose all your profit and more,' he says. 'It is at the end of the
checklist because the most important thing is whether the project stands
up.'
The accountants were generally happier to know where they and their small
business clients stood and how to manage the relationship better,
particularly as McIlveen also advised on how to approach bank managers.
Popping in for a vague chat about extending existing facilities is
ill-advised; written business plans - enlivened by photographs - are
encouraged, as are term loans at fixed interest rates. Only then will
NatWest send someone to look round to start scoring 'C' for character
points.

FT  14 JUN 94 / Technoogy: Gene genie - A look at one scientist's
potentially revolutionary effect on genetic-related business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH SHAPLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Craig Venter, one of America's leading gene researchers, does not appear
stung by having been likened to a monkey operating a machine or by the fact
that the insult came from a pioneer of modern molecular biology, James
Watson.
More than two years after Watson criticised Venter's plans to find the
chemical sequence of human genetic DNA, Venter is busy in his new, non
profit-making Institute for Genomic Research in Gaithersburg, Maryland, a
few miles from the government's National Institutes of Health, where he
pioneered the rapid identification of human genes.
Venter, finding that he could not expand his gene sequencing work at NIH,
now works for private industry. He is confident that his team will identify
virtually all human genes within a few years and is seeking patents to turn
this knowledge into a revolutionary range of diagnostic tests and therapies.
Since Venter raised the possibility of identifying and patenting large
amounts of human genetic material in 1991, he has been criticised by other
scientists. For many years, university and government researchers have made
the DNA and protein sequences they discover publicly available in data
banks.
But Venter's innovations changed the terms of gene science. In 1989 at NIH,
Venter discovered how to use automated sequencing machines on a large scale
to identify short strands of complementary DNA, or cDNA, which is produced
when genes hidden in the chromosome become active. Venter harnessed powerful
computers to match his DNA strands with known ones and with DNA from other
organisms. In this way he could work out the structure of the longer gene
which his bit of cDNA came from. This made the hitherto painstaking work of
gene hunting possible on a vast scale.
At NIH, Venter applied his technique to his own neurological research but
his proposals to expand the work were rejected twice by Watson's Human
Genome Centre, also at NIH.
Gene hunters usually proceed by identifying a function or disease, locating
a likely chromosome and region where the gene might be found, and working
along the chromosomal DNA, which is millions of base pairs (chemical units)
long. While this identifies each pair of 'beads' along the chromosomal
'necklace' and extends knowledge of function, it is time-consuming and
costly. Venter's method shortcuts to the gene itself  - not necessarily
knowing anything about function or region - and accumulates masses of base
pair data.
Other scientists criticised Venter's technique as 'fast food' science. In
December 1991 at a public meeting with members of Congress and the press
Venter mentioned that NIH had filed for patents on 315 of his sequences.
Watson rose to say that automatic sequence machines 'could be run by
monkeys'.
If patents were sought on genes or parts of genes whose function was
unknown, gene research would be tied in knots for years by patent
litigation, he said. Watson was the chief of NIH's part of the quest to
define the whole genome - all human genetic material - on which the US
government expects to spend Dollars 3bn (Pounds 2bn) by 2005. NIH director
Bernadine Healy defended the patent filings. Watson resigned in April 1992
over this and other issues.
Venter also left NIH in 1992 when Wallace Steinberg, chief of Healthcare
Investment Corporation, offered him Dollars 70m over 10 years for a new
non-profit institute, if Venter would give worldwide exclusive rights to his
research to a companion profit-making biotech company. Venter's institute,
known as TIGR, is funded by Steinberg's money (raised to Dollars 85m)
flowing through the new company, Human Genome Sciences.
The scale of TIGR and HGS's growing genetic library is awesome. Venter's
institute runs 30 automatic sequence machines and HGS has another 50. In
TIGR's lab, analysers and sequencers are arrayed in rows like an assembly
line. Upstairs are the main computers: a Sun SparcCenter 2000 which keeps
track of the DNA library, and a Maspar 2204 supercomputer which searches for
similar sequences in public databases and analyses the DNA.
TIGR and HGS sequence 750,000 nucleotides per day. The NIH Genome Project,
in contrast, expects to complete 1.5m nucleotides of finished sequence in
the whole of 1995.
Using the classic approach, scientists around the world took 10 years to
identify 3,000 human genes. Since January 1993, the Venter-HGS operation may
have found as many as 30,000 genes; for it has more than 60,000 unique
sequences, of which 4,500 were previously known in public databanks. Since
there are an estimated 100,000 genes, HGS chairman William Haseltine says
they will have a 'virtually complete' set of human genes in 'one to two
years'. The fact that the largest gene library will be in private hands will
be equally revolutionary.
The company has arranged for SmithKline Beecham to have first call to
develop the results, in exchange for access to Dollars 125m. SB's support
was the source of HGS's 1993 profit of Dollars 1.8m on Dollars 22m revenues.
HGS and TIGR are not the only private gene-hunting operations in the private
sector but they are the largest.
However, the US Patent Office rejected all the applications NIH filed on
Venter's gene sequences. Rejection of all 25 filings that HGS has made would
spell disaster for the venture. But Haseltine says HGS has applied on more
complete sequences and whole genes and in all cases their utility is
claimed. 'We believe we will meet all the criteria for patentability,' he
says.
Meanwhile, he and Venter are arranging to make their research available
publicly in ways that do not conflict with their ownership.
Venter is pleased with the turn of events. 'I feel a major social and
scientific responsibility to patent,' he says. 'I left NIH to change the
starting point in science.'
The outcome of what Venter calls his 'giant business and social experiment'
will be anything but dull. Other biotech start-up companies have seen their
promise fade.
Following HGS's successful stock offering last December, Venter's shares in
the company became worth about Dollars 12m. But he could become even richer
if the award of patents forces others to pay licence fees to bring about the
expected gene-based revolution in medicine.

FT  14 JUN 94 / Technology: Keeping the engine running smoothly - Why Royal
Dutch/Shell is spending Pounds 70m on an R&amp;D overhaul
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Formula One racing cars were allowed to carry only a fixed amount of
fuel to get them through a race, many used to succumb to dry tanks in the
closing stages.
The answer to improving fuel economy was engine oil. By making it thinner,
viscosity was lower, so the engine turned slightly more freely and needed
less fuel for the same speed. The consequence was about one lap's extra
travel per race - the difference between winning and losing.
Carrying this principle to the ordinary car or truck on the ordinary road
is, however, more difficult than it appears. Road vehicles have to last
years, not the two hours of an F1 race. Thinner oils that get even thinner
as engine temperature rises are no aid to longevity; volatility increases,
so oil and vapour seep up the cylinder into the combustion chamber where
they burn, possibly leading to smoking, particle-laden exhaust fumes.
The Anglo-Dutch company Royal Dutch/Shell demonstrates the dangers on a
test-bed using a 10-litre Volvo truck diesel engine. To solve the problem,
chemicals must be added to control the viscosity of the oil and stabilise
the range of its volatility - in effect to limit how thin it can get and how
much can evaporate above the piston head.
Motorists may grumble that this sort of work will inevitably make engine
oils more expensive, but Shell says it is not so much selling high-tech oil
as commercial benefits worth much more. Like all leading oil companies it
claims to be responding to trends in market demand.
Car manufacturers and most drivers want improved fuel economy, reduced oil
consumption, longer lasting oil at higher temperatures, fewer oil changes,
extended engine life, lower particle and noxious exhaust emissions, and more
care for the environment.
The benefits have been creeping up on us almost unnoticed, so that we
already take many for granted. 'When did you last have a car that needed a
decoke?' asks Andrew Scott, head of engineering services at Shell's main UK
research centre at Thornton, near Ellesmere Port in Cheshire.
He and David Parkes, Thornton's managing director, were elaborating on
Shell's decision last month to spend Pounds 70m over seven years modernising
and expanding the research centre, which is Shell's world headquarters for
studying what happens to fuels and lubricants inside internal combustion
engines.
The investment in Thornton will be one of the biggest single cash injections
yet in UK-based research and development. Shell has 15 complexes of
laboratories worldwide with Thornton one of the largest.
It currently employs 600 staff with a wide range of scientific skills. By
the end of next year it will take in 140 extra scientists from another
research centre in Sittingbourne, Kent, which Shell is closing.
The Cheshire centre's main work stems from its original wartime role - it
was founded in 1940 - developing fuels and lubricants for the Allied air
forces and tanks fighting in North Africa.
However, it has also become one of the world's foremost centres for
combustion science and hazard analysis, where its work on gas explosions in
confined spaces has made for safer design of offshore oil and gas platforms
since the Piper Alpha disaster in 1988. The Sittingbourne scientists will
add environmental and additives synthesis research to Thornton's portfolio.
The Pounds 70m will mainly be spent replacing a large number of old
buildings with a smaller number of bigger laboratory wings, linked by
communal support services. Additions will include a new product development
and testing centre, as well as a visitor centre to improve public relations.
Although this will confirm Thornton's position as the group's prime
laboratory for research and development in oil products, there is a great
deal of hard-headed commercial nous behind the decision, apart from merely
adding to prestige.
There was debate within Shell about whether to build on a green-field site,
rather than extending Thornton in the shadow of the giant Stanlow refinery.
This would have cost twice as much, but would a more bucolic environment
lead to better work?
Most of Thornton is surrounded by the green fields of Cheshire anyway - and,
the argument went, it would do no harm to remind scientists of what they
were there for by having Stanlow next door.
What was crucial, senior management argued, was to get away from a 'rabbit
hutch' image of having people scattered about in small, individual
buildings. Thornton's buildings have been numbered sequentially as they have
been constructed; the site is now up to building number 205 in 54 years as
new ones have replaced old ones.
Parkes says the design of the new Thornton will bring people into closer
contact in the communal services areas, promoting the exchange of ideas and
creativity. He also thinks a more pleasant environment will help attract and
retain staff. He believes all this should help teamwork and the pursuit of
collective, commercial goals. 'One of the problems of industrial R&amp;D is to
extend the customer-contract principle into the laboratory,' says Parkes.
Although 'blue sky' research still accounts for 10 per cent of the budget,
most of these customers have a market to sell to, such as millions of
motorists - and even the odd Formula One racing team.

FT  14 JUN 94 / Mortgage arrears 'down 25%'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The number of households in arrears with their mortgages has fallen by
almost a quarter in the past year, says a report published today.
The annual survey, by Roof Briefing, a newsletter published by the housing
magazine Roof, is the most extensive and up-to-date survey of mortgage debt.
It shows that the number of households with mortgage arrears of two months
or more fell to 613,300 in the year to March 31 from 800,150. One in 17
householders is behind with mortgage payments compared with one in 13 a year
ago.
The survey includes for the first time a breakdown of the figures on arrears
and repossessions by type of lender. Banks, insurers and building societies
all have similar levels of arrears, at about 5 per cent of loans.
But the centralised lenders that entered the market in the 1980s have
average arrears levels of more than 15 per cent.
There is a similar picture for repossessions, with centralised lenders
repossessing almost 2.5 per cent of their homes last year, five times the
average level of the other lenders.
These averages conceal wide variations between individual lenders. The level
of arrears for building societies ranges from 2.8 per cent of loans to 12.6
per cent. One centralised lender has arrears on more than 22 per cent of
loans.
The biggest fall is in short-term arrears, indicating that fewer homeowners
are getting into difficulties with their mortgages.
The number of households two months behind with payments has fallen 32 per
cent from 198,000 to 135,840.
The author, Ms Janet Ford of Loughborough University, says repossessions
probably account for most of the 15 per cent reduction in arrears of more
than 12 months, as well as a proportion of the fall in arrears between six
and 12 months. Most lenders start repossession proceedings when arrears
reach six months, with the process usually completed six months later.
The big fall in short-term arrears suggests, however, that fewer borrowers
are getting into debt. Ms Ford says one reason for this is the greater care
lenders are taking to ensure that borrowers can afford their loans. Another
is the 'marked improvement in many lenders' management and control of early
arrears'.
She says homes are more affordable, with low interest rates and lower house
prices.

FT  14 JUN 94 / Factory output prices subdued
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's producer price figures for May presented a mixed picture of
inflationary trends, with subdued price rises for finished goods somewhat
overshadowed by an upturn in the cost of fuel and raw materials.
The Central Statistical Office reported that the price of goods from UK
factories in May increased at the lowest annual rate since December 1986,
suggesting no immediate danger of output prices boosting consumer price
inflation.
But prices for materials and fuel purchased by industry showed their fourth
consecutive seasonally-adjusted, month-on-month increase, reflecting higher
oil and commodity prices. This end six months in which input prices fell
compared with the same month a year before.
The output price index, which is not seasonally adjusted, increased by 0.1
per cent between April and May and was up 2 per cent in May compared with
May last year.
Excluding food, beverages, tobacco and petroleum, the output index - this
time seasonally adjusted - was also up by 0.1 per cent on the month and 2
per cent on the year.
The CSO said this index, which is considered a good guide to underlying
trends, showed an annualised increase of only 1.1 per cent in the three
months to the end of May compared with the previous three months.
By contrast, the seasonally-adjusted index for input prices increased by 0.9
per cent in May compared with April. On an unadjusted basis the input price
index rose 0.7 per cent during the month and was unchanged compared with May
last year.
The Treasury welcomed the lower-than-expected output price rise but warned
that it was important that industry's 'good performance on cost control'
should continue in the light of higher input prices.

FT  14 JUN 94 / Student voucher plan seeks to use market forces
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's recommendation from university vice-chancellors for a 'voucher'
system for students to pay for higher education is an un-precedented move.
Their report also proposes a radical package of measures to make it easier
for students to move between universities, and to re-enter education after a
career break.
The aim is to restructure higher education following the recent sharp
expansion in numbers - which has seen the proportion of 18-year-olds going
to university double in five years - while safeguarding quality.
The report comes from the Higher Education Quality Council, an agency set up
by the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals, with government
backing, to oversee standards in universities. The council also calls for
further expansion and extended student choice.
The recommendations cover the entire higher-education system, and include
proposals to set up a National Credit Framework for further and higher
education.
This proposal would allow students to accumulate credits towards an eventual
qualification in different institutions, taking breaks if they wanted to do
so.
To back this reform, students would be given a uniform National Credit
Transcript, similar to the US model, which would ensure that their progress
was being marked to a common standard. This in turn would require an
electronic National Credit Register, and an independent central service for
evaluating credentials.
A new 'associate degree' would be established as an interim qualification
into higher education. The quality council believes this could be linked to
the General National Vocational Qualifications being introduced as an
alternative to A-levels in schools. These qualifications cover broad
vocational subjects such as leisure and tourism or manufacturing.
The new qualification would not be equal to an honours degree in value, but
could be used as a stepping-stone to one.
Legislation would be amended to ensure that tuition fees, paid by the
government direct to colleges and universities, and maintenance grants paid
to students would be portable between different institutions.
Institutions would be paid according to a system of credits, earning more
credits if more students successfully gained qualifications.
Educational vouchers for students would be introduced, which could be
redeemed to pay for any course at any university, introducing more market
disciplines for education providers.
Student information products, such as prospectuses, would be a subject to a
quality 'kitemark' to ensure that choices were based on reliable
information.
Universities would start a consultative forum for professional bodies and
employers.

FT  14 JUN 94 / Toyota plant fails to boost Midlands economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The economic effects of Toyota's Pounds 550m car plant at Burnaston,
Derbyshire, have been considerably less than politicians and planners
expected when the project was announced in 1989.
A report commissioned by the environment and employment departments and by
Midlands councils says assumptions that Toyota's presence would induce
companies to establish plants in the Midlands have been unfounded.
The report will be presented to Staffordshire County Council later this
week.
Production started at the Toyota plant in late 1992. So far about 2,600 jobs
have been created including 1,800 at Burnaston and about 800 indirectly.
Mr David Slee, Staffordshire director of planning and economic development,
said in a note for councillors: 'Extra employment has only partially
compensated for major job losses experienced at firms such as Rolls-Royce
and Pirelli.'
Ecotec Research and Consulting, which prepared the report after studying the
impact of Toyota on a region within 50 miles of Burnaston, said that 16
firms were known to have relocated or to have set up in the area since the
end of 1992.
It attributed the limited inward investment to:
Limited production volumes as Toyota builds up production.
Toyota not yet fully adopting a 'just-in-time' system of delivery.
Excess capacity among component suppliers.
The inward investment projects have used 32 acres of land, but Staffordshire
and Derbyshire made provision in their land-use plans for Toyota-related
developments to use 642 acres.
A similar miscalculation took place with housing. Ecotec said: 'It seems
unlikely that the additional housing demand which has been generated amounts
to more than 400 to 500 units. This compares with additional associated
structure plan allocations of 6,700 houses in Derbyshire and Staffordshire.'
Direct employment at Toyota is expected to rise to 3,000 as production grows
towards the end of the decade. By that time 6,900 people will be directly or
indirectly involved with the plant.
Ecotec said this would generate local income of Pounds 92.6m, but the size
of the local economy and the diffusion of the income across it 'mean that
most of the economic impacts should still be absorbed fairly easily'.

FT  14 JUN 94 / Four county councils to go in Banham's radical proposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS and IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Plans to abolish four county councils and cut the powers of a fifth were
published yesterday in a radical blueprint for local government reform.
Sir John Banham, chairman of the Local Government Commission for England,
which is charged with recommending new local authority structures to Mr John
Gummer, the environment secretary, said that the two-tier system of counties
and districts should be replaced with new all-purpose 'unitary authorities'.
These would have all the powers now shared by districts and counties.
Warrington in Cheshire and the city of Oxford would be given unitary status
on their own boundaries.
Elsewhere, the new authorities would be formed by merging current district
councils, as the commission believes the new councils would need a
population of between 150,000 and 250,000 to be viable.
Huntingdonshire, which Mr John Major, the prime minister, represents in
parliament and which is administratively a part of Cambridgeshire, is the
one exception. It would be given unitary status on its own boundaries in
spite of its small population, in a move which echoes last week's decision
to give unitary status to Rutland, another ancient county.
In Kent the two-tier system would be retained across most of the county,
against the government's wishes.
The commission has said that in all the counties it is merely stating one
'preference', and has provided other alternatives which it believes are
viable. All households in the counties concerned will receive leaflets on
the different options next week, and will be invited to vote on which option
they prefer.
If change proves unpopular the government might be provided with an excuse
to abandon the reform programme, which has already proved highly
controversial in the counties for which the commission announced
recommendations last year, such as Somerset and North Yorkshire.
The cross-party Association of District Councils complained that in no
county had the commission recommended the plans for mergers which local
districts had presented while the Labour-controlled Association of County
Councils welcomed the retention of two tiers in Kent.
The commission's detailed proposals for the five counties are:
Cambridgeshire
The two-tier status quo is not on offer as an option, as both the county
council and the districts proposed a unitary system. Huntingdonshire would
become a unitary authority, following what the commission described as
'significant support for an unitary solution'.
Peterborough and Fenland districts would merge, as would Cambridge City,
South Cambridgeshire and East Cambridgeshire. Local politicians were still
angry, as the county called for only two unitaries, while the districts
wanted four, with unitary status for Cambridge.
The Association of County Councils complained that outside Huntingdonshire,
keeping the status quo had been the favoured option in the commission's
first consultation, supported by 43 per cent of residents.
Cheshire
Cheshire's 966,000 people are to be asked to choose between three proposals.
All would create a new unitary authority in Warrington, which was moved from
Lancashire to Cheshire 20 years ago and now houses nearly 184,000 people
after forced growth as a new town until the mid-1980s.
The commission's preferred option for the rest of Cheshire is to redraw
district boundaries creating four unitary authorities with between 143,000
and 250,000 people each.
These would merge Chester with Ellesmere Port, Macclesfield with the town of
Congleton, expand the current Halton district council, and create 'Crewe and
Mid-Cheshire' to include Crewe, Nantwich and Northwich. The commission says
this might cost Pounds 2m a year but could save Pounds 4m a year, with
start-up costs between Pounds 24m and Pounds 29m.
The alternative is a series of mergers on existing boundaries to create four
authorities from seven, the smallest 124,000 people, the largest 236,000.
Annual costs might be Pounds 1m but savings could be Pounds 4m. Start-up
would cost between Pounds 23m and Pounds 28m.
The third proposal is to leave the rest of Cheshire as a two-tier structure,
with more power devolved to districts.
Leaders of Congleton, one of the districts most affected, said yesterday
that they would support this. The commission's preferred option would split
their district, while abolishing the county for all but ceremonial purposes
would threaten strategic planning.
Cumbria
The commission wants to cut Cumbria in two, controversially bisecting the
Lake District, which would no longer have one overall authority. South
Cumbria would take in Barrow-in-Furness and South Lakeland, with the Millom
area of Copeland and the area south of Shap in Eden. The rest of the county,
including Carlisle, would be linked in North Cumbria.
The commission said responsibility for land use planning would be shared by
the new councils and the Lake District National Park Planning Board.
People would also be able to opt to return to the historic county boundaries
of Lancashire, Yorkshire, Cumberland and Westmoreland for ceremonial and
traditional purposes.
Ms Ann Levick, joint commissioner for the area, said the consultation of
residents which started next week was not a referendum but a means of
ensuring people's views were taken seriously.
Kent
Only two unitary authorities would be created, both on the edge of greater
London. North West Kent would be formed by a merger of Dartford and
Gravesham, while Medway would take in Gillingham and Rochester district
councils. The rest of the county would remain as it is.
The reserve option is to split Kent into seven unitary authorities, but the
county - one of the largest and most powerful, with several supporters on
the Tory back benches - signalled it intends to fight to retain the status
quo.
Oxfordshire
Oxford would be an independent city with a population of 131,500. The rest
of the county would be split into two unitary authorities - Northern
Oxfordshire - taking over Cherwell and West Oxfordshire; and Southern
Oxfordshire, formed by a merger of Vale of White Horse and South Oxfordshire
districts.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary and an Oxfordshire MP, has called for
the status quo to be kept.
The commission's second option follows the county's plan for a large
county-wide authority, abolishing district councils, with powers devolved to
parishes and town councils.

FT  14 JUN 94 / Mercury mobile business tariff cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mercury One-2-One, the mobile-phone operator in the London region, yesterday
announced a sharp cut in its business tariff. The move comes a week after
Vodafone, the largest cellular operator, said that tariffs would be
unchanged for the rest of the year.
One-2-One will cut its business tariff from 16p a minute to 14p next week
and its monthly subscription from Pounds 20 to Pounds 17.50.
Business subscribers will be able to make international calls at rates
cheaper than BT's standard tariffs for an extra fee of Pounds 3 a month. For
an extra Pounds 10 they will be able to make local calls without charge on
weekday nights and at weekends.
The move will put pressure on Vodafone and Cellnet, the second-largest
operator, to cut their tariffs, although both operators said their networks
did not need to be price competitive with One-2-One because they offered
national coverage.
The changes pitch One-2-One's tariffs far below those of its larger rivals,
which charge a monthly rental of Pounds 25 and a peak rate tariff of 25p a
minute - reduced to Pounds 20 and 20p respectively on a tariff available in
the London region.
The past year has seen mobile phone tariffs fall by as much as a third, with
two new networks - One-2-One and Orange, operated by Hutchison Microtel -
launched in the past eight months. One-2-One has gained nearly 100,000
subscribers in the London region since September.
Mr Kevin Langford, mobile-cellular analyst at Fleming Securities, said
One-2-One's price cuts appeared to be aimed at shifting business customers
from its residential tariff - which offers no-charge local calls on weekdays
after 7pm and at weekends - and to forestalling competition from Orange,
whose tariffs are particularly attractive to high-usage business customers.
Its network is more extensive than One-2-One's and will be expanded faster.
Mr Richard Goswell, One-2-One managing director, said he did not rule out
raising tariffs again as the network expanded.
The cheapest handset for One-2-One's network retails for Pounds 199, which
is significantly more expensive than those for the analogue networks of the
larger operators.
The UK has nearly 2.5m cellular mobile subscribers, more per capita than
most of the rest of the EU but behind the US and Scandinavia.
Orange claims 30 per cent of subscribers in the London region. Vodafone and
Cellnet, which launched their networks in the mid 1980s, both have more than
1m subscribers.

FT  14 JUN 94 / Improved service pledge for jobseekers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unemployed people, who are coming under increased government pressure to
find jobs, can expect an improved service from their local Jobcentres under
the terms of a Jobseeker's Charter published yesterday.
The charter, the second for jobseekers, says that callers at the Employment
Service should be seen on time and 'certainly must not wait longer than 10
minutes'.
It comes when the service is getting even tougher on people who it believes
are not actively seeking work. Unemployed people are being offered vacancies
which are deemed 'hard to fill' as a way of testing whether they are genuine
applicants for social security benefit.
The service is responding to continuing governmental pressure to get people
into jobs - with individual offices displaying their own and other offices'
performances.
This year the service as a whole has been given a target by the government
of getting 1.7m people into work, compared with 1.47m in 1993-94.
Other features of the charter, announced by Mr David Hunt, the employment
secretary, include pledges:
To make it a priority that job vacancies advertised are as up-to-date as
possible.
To answer telephone calls within 30 seconds.
To respond to letters within five working days - in clear, plain language.
To pay the right amount of benefit on time.

FT  14 JUN 94 / European Elections: Spread of red across the map delights
Labour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is a sight that Labour politicians have been waiting to see for 15 years:
splotches of red all over southern England.
Since Labour's general election defeat in 1979 the party has repeatedly
faced an insurmountable problem each time it goes to the polls - its lack of
credibility with the more affluent voters in the south.
Labour can do - and has repeatedly done - very well in Scotland, the north
and the Midlands. But the distrust of southern voters at successive general
elections, in particular over Labour's tax and spending policies, has robbed
the party of power every time.
Yesterday it was different. Labour party managers sensed that - at long last
 -they had made a breakthrough which augurs victory at the next general
election.
In the two Essex Euro-constituencies, bastions of the C2 voters who ritually
support the Tories, Labour won stunning victories. In Bedfordshire and
Milton Keynes, where the party faced a ferocious campaign from Mrs Edwina
Currie, the former Tory minister, the Labour candidate won with a
substantial majority.
Even in Thames Valley - with ultra-safe Tory constituencies such as
Berkshire East and Windsor-and-Maidenhead - Labour came within 700 votes of
taking the seat.
To cap it all, there was the party's performance against the Liberal
Democrats.
Labour's fear in every campaign has been that Mr Paddy Ashdown's party will
reap the votes of disaffected Tory voters who cannot stomach Labour.
Yesterday Labour claimed that southern Tory voters had shifted to their
party 'without stopping off on the way'. While Labour now has 16 Euro-seats
in the south, the Liberal Democrats have ended up with only two. And in
those few southern seats which remain Tory, Labour has come second many more
times than Mr Ashdown's party.
But questions still loom over Labour's performance. In particular, is the
party secure enough in the south to repeat this performance in a general
election that could be three years away?
Mr Jack Straw, Labour's campaign manager, was anxious to underline that
Labour's performance in the south, far from being a one-day wonder, had been
steadily built up since the county council elections in 1993.
He said: 'It has been a cumulative effect. The more people have seen us win
in parts of the south, the more confidence they have in our ability to win
in other parts of the south.'
Labour activists said that the party had learned the important lesson of
fighting every southern by-election to win.
One party activist said: 'At previous by-elections we have had candidates
but downplayed their campaigns, making it look like the Liberal Democrats
were the challengers. At Eastleigh we went for victory, establishing a
platform for us in the rest of the region.'
Above all, the party can build on this success if - as seems almost certain
 -Mr Tony Blair is elected Labour leader. His more middle-class,
public-school background must consolidate the party's grip on the south.
But Conservative activists in southern constituencies were far from downcast
yesterday.
In the Euro-constituency of Hertfordshire, which the conservatives lost to
Labour, a local Tory MP said that most of his regular supporters had not
come out to vote. 'There is no reason why we should not get back these
supporters next time,' he said. 'The main thing is that there has not been a
permanent shift of supporters from the Tories to Labour.'
Another Tory MP said that the Liberal Democrats' poor performance in the
south could help him at the next election. He said: 'In a two-way contest we
are far more likely to keep our main supporters because the disaffected just
don't vote Labour.'
Above all, Tories can take some comfort from the occasional splits between
the Labour and Liberal Democrat votes, which have helped them to keep
constituencies such as Surrey and Sussex South.
A senior figure at Conservative Central Office said: 'The fear was that the
Liberal Democrats would make big inroads against us, but they didn't. We
have kept our heartlands and that is the first stage in a recovery that will
win us the next election.'

FT  14 JUN 94 / European Elections: Major blames low poll turnout on
disillusionment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major yesterday blamed the low turnout in the European elections on
public disillusionment with Europe and pledged to campaign for a fresh start
for the European Union.
Speaking to journalists in the garden of 10 Downing Street, Mr Major
strongly defended his campaign decision to commit the government to a
multi-speed Europe.
He said the concept, first floated last month by Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign
secretary, offered a 'middle way' for Europe between federalism and
disintegration. Mr Major denied that the critical tone of the election
campaign amounted to an endorsement of the Eurosceptic views of Conservative
opponents to the Maastricht treaty on European integration.
'I am not bowing either to the Euro-enthusiasts or the Eurosceptics. I am
saying and doing precisely what I believe is right for Europe,' he said.
Mr Major said that the election results showed that people throughout the EU
were concerned at the way the union had developed. 'The turnout was rotten
in other countries as well as here. People are frustrated. All the governing
parties did badly. I think, therefore, we have to think afresh about how to
make Europe a success,' he said.
'I don't believe, myself, that the ideal lies on either extreme - tearing
down what exists or building it up to some unreasonable federalist centre.
There is a middle way, a practical way for Europe.'
Mr Major said he was confident that the government could recover from its
poor election performance, which was roughly the same as the Conservatives'
opinion poll standing when he became prime minister in 1990.
He said there would be no changes in policy, and claimed that the
Conservative performance in the elections had 'discredited' the opinion
polls, which had forecast a Labour lead of between 21 and 33 percentage
points.
'I believe it has been clear for some years that many people are simply not
frank when asked questions by opinion-pollsters,' he said. 'I suspect they
resent the prying nature of the questions, and it seems that the answers are
not always accurate. Perhaps a lower salience for opinion polls in the
future would be welcomed by quite a lot of people.'
Mr Bob Worcester, head of the MORI polling organisation, said Mr Major's
criticisms were 'self-serving' and urged him to listen to the message from
the polls and the voters.
However, the prime minister's strategy is likely to be endorsed by the
Conservative party's centre-left majority, which sees it as a way of uniting
the warring pro-Europe and anti-Europe wings.
One senior centre-left minister said he believed the issue would 'go away'
now that the election campaign was over because there was no immediate
trigger for further divisions.
This was regarded as an unduly optimistic outlook by other centre-left MPs,
who pointed out that the prime minister's manoeuvring skills would be tested
as early as next week, when the EU Council of Ministers is expected to
choose a successor to Mr Jacques Delors as president of the European
Commission.
Pessimists on the centre-left also pointed to legislation, expected later
this year, which will increase the UK's contribution to the EU budget by
about Pounds 200m a year by 1999.
The increase, agreed at the 1992 Edinburgh summit of EU leaders, is bitterly
opposed by many Eurosceptics, including the hard-core rebels who almost
defeated the government over the Maastricht bill.

FT  14 JUN 94 / European Elections: Party divided on Smith effect
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour leaders were divided yesterday about the impact of John Smith's death
on the party's strong performance in the European elections.
Mr Jack Straw, Labour's campaign manager, said claims that Labour benefited
from a sympathy vote triggered by Mr Smith's death were wrong.
'Nothing could be further from the truth,' Mr Straw told journalists at
Labour's post-election press conference in London.
He said that Labour had gathered 'clear evidence' to the contrary in private
polls taken two and a half weeks ago in the Eastleigh parliamentary
constituency. Labour would have come 'very close' to winning the Eastleigh
by-election - it finished in second place - if Mr Smith had lived.
Mrs Margaret Beckett, the party's acting leader, said Mr Smith had played a
part in Labour's strong performance in the European elections and Thursday's
five by-elections.' The credit for these victories goes to the whole team,'
she said. 'That does include the late John Smith.'
Mr John Major, the prime minister, was in no doubt at his post-election
press conference that Mr Smith's tragic death had boosted Labour's vote in
the European elections.
He said: 'This election was held at a time uniquely favourable to the Labour
party, for reasons - some of them sad - that I believe everyone fully
understands.
'Even so, after a deep recession, and on a low turnout, they barely beat the
share of the vote that we achieved in the last general election.'
Many Labour MPs believe the prime minister was wrong to suggest that the
party's vote was artificially boosted by public sympathy, in spite of the
week of national mourning that followed Mr Smith's death.
One senior backbencher pointed out that Labour's 45 per cent share of the
vote in the European elections was in line with the party's opinion-poll
ratings in the weeks leading up to the poll, before Mr Smith's fatal heart
attack.

FT  14 JUN 94 / European Elections: PM avoids need to fall on sword
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD and KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Conservative backbenchers were divided as to how far you had to go back to
find the party doing as badly in terms of national vote as it did in the
European elections. The three most popular dates were 1966, 1906 and 1832.
If the Tories were divided on history there was a rare unanimity on the
result's implications. The prime minister had avoided an immediate challenge
to his leadership.
While the share of the vote for the Tories - at 28 per cent - was at the
lower end of expectations, the 18 seats gained were somewhere in the middle.
A senior MP on the 1922 committee of Tory backbenchers said: 'It could have
been a lot worse without a first-past-the-post system. If we had been
reduced to single figures there may have been a deputation to the prime
minister suggesting he fall on his sword.'
Most backbenchers responding to questions yesterday said Mr John Major had
until November to turn things around or face a serious challenge to his
leadership.
He was not without his critics, however. Mr William Powell, Tory MP for
Corby, called on him to quit in order to flush out those against him.
'He would then be saying to all his critics: 'Stand up and fight if you're
going to,' ' Mr Powell told BBC Radio 4.
'You would get out of the way this question of who is the leader of the
Conservative party without months and months of debilitating speculation.'
Mr David Nicholson, chairman of the Tory group of west-country MPs, said:
'The whole of the government has got to pull itself together and the prime
minister must take the lead and show strength in dealing with disloyalty and
incompetent ministers.'
Another backbencher said he feared the Tory conference would be turned into
an 'unseemly leadership contest similar to the one in 1963', which led to
Harold Macmillan being replaced as prime minister by Sir Alec Douglas-Home
(now Lord Home).
By averting an immediate challenge, some backbenchers believe Mr Major will
be in a stronger position to defend his job in November, when the party
rules allow for a contest.
Mr Major yesterday stressed: 'I will be leading the party at the next
election.
'I am still here. We have a mechanism if people wish to challenge me in the
autumn. That is a matter for them. I don't expect one. I will be here
waiting for it if there is one. I will beat it and I shall be here . . .
until the general election.'
Mr Teddy Taylor, a leading Eurosceptic, said he thought the prime minister
would now survive any challenge. 'It was clear from the campaign that people
believe John Major has integrity and honesty, unlike his prospective
challengers and the government as a whole. The Conservatives performance was
bad, but still better than expected.'

FT  14 JUN 94 / European Elections: Reform of MPs' hours is backed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A radical overhaul of Westminster's antiquated working practices moved a
step closer yesterday after Mr John Major said he wanted to agree a
blueprint for reform before MPs depart next month for their summer holidays.
The prime minister used a post-European election press conference to try to
inject new momentum into the push for shorter hours and more efficient use
of parliamentary time. He said the government was keen to make progress on
changes that would enable parliament to do its business 'in more sensible
ways, in more sensible hours'.
He continued: 'If the opposition are equally keen, I hope we should be able
to map the way forward before the summer recess.'
Yesterday's remarks come more than two years after an all-party committee of
MPs tabled a series of proposals designed to bring more rationality and
commonsense to Westminster arrangements.
The proposals - enshrined in the Jopling report - called for one morning
sitting a week, some Fridays off and the automatic timetabling of
legislation.
Efforts to secure cross-party agreement to a package of changes based on the
report's recommendations have been hit by a number of setbacks, however. The
most recent was Labour's decision late last year to break off all relations
with the government in protest at ministers' decision to curtail debate on
bills implementing changes to statutory sick pay and National Insurance
contributions.
Since this protest ended Mr Tony Newton, leader of the Commons, is
understood to have had one meeting to discuss the way ahead with Mr Nick
Brown, a Labour frontbench spokesman. Another meeting is planned soon.
In his comments yesterday Mr Major spoke of 'a great deal of concern' around
the country about the way parliament did its business. 'I share that concern
expressed to me,' he said.
Commending the 'excellent' Jopling report, the prime minister said he hoped
more sensible ways could be found of enabling the Commons to do its
business. This would be without 'either unacceptably reducing the
government's capacity to carry its programme or reducing the opposition's
flexibility in deploying and pressing its case against government
legislation'.
He continued: 'I believe that this effort has very strong support on both
sides of the House and very strong support outside the House from millions
who follow our procedures.

FT  14 JUN 94 / European Elections: Party chairman says Labour the 'only
truly national party'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
'Labour is the only truly national party now,' Mr David Blunkett, Labour
party chairman, said yesterday. 'These superb results confirm that Labour is
not only on course to defeat the Conservatives in the general election, but
has finally laid to rest the Liberal Democrat myth that Labour cannot win in
the south of England.'
As Labour and the Liberal Democrats blamed each other for limiting Tory
losses, Mr Blunkett said: 'If the Tories had not been rescued by the Liberal
Democrats in Thames Valley, Sussex South and Crawley and the Cotswolds, they
would have suffered an even worse humiliation than they did in the end.'

FT  14 JUN 94 / European Elections: Labour's triumph may still not lead to
government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUTLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Euro-election was not quite as bad for the Conservatives, or indeed for
the Liberal Democrats, as it seemed at first sight. Labour's triumph was not
on a scale that guarantees its return to government.
The Conservatives' 28 per cent of the vote is 6 per cent less than their
lowest ever in a national contest, which matches Labour's rock bottom of 28
per cent in the 1983 general election. The party has only one seat north of
a line from Ipswich to Worcester and was lucky not to suffer a wipe-out.
Only two of its 18 MEPs has a majority over 5 per cent. A 2 per cent further
swing would have reduced the party to 5 seats.
Yet the Conservatives did hang on at least in England where they came second
in all but one of the seats they did not win. They were second in Wales in
only two seats and only one in Scotland. Their vote was plainly reduced by
the various anti-Europe candidates, who drew in 3 per cent of the vote where
they stood. Four anti-Europeans and two Greens just topped 5 per cent and so
saved their deposits.
But the Conservatives could take comfort in some aspects of the other
parties' performance. Labour at 45 per cent was well below its recent 50 per
cent poll ratings. The party got 6 per cent less of the vote than the
Conservatives did in the first Euro-elections in 1979.
The Conservatives have a mountain to climb before the next election but it
is more easily surmountable than seemed likely in the aftermath of
Eastleigh.
There is also solace for the Conservatives in the unexpected pattern of
tactical voting. There are eight Tory MEPs in Devon, Dorset, Wiltshire,
Hampshire and Sussex who would not be there if Labour voters had behaved as
they did in the Newbury and Christchurch by-elections last year. The
100-plus Conservative MPs whose main challenger is from a Liberal Democrat
will breathe a bit more easily.
The Liberal Democrats won two seats easily and were within 4 per cent of
victory in six more. But their vote fell slightly from its 1992 levels
everywhere except in its heartland. Sheffield, oddly, provided the one seat
where they moved up from third to second place. However they did hold on to
and, indeed, improve their position throughout their main territory. This is
a solid band from Lands End along the south coast and inland where the
Liberals come first or second. This area contains 74 Westminster seats (more
than the whole of Scotland). It guarantees the Liberal Democrats a
continuing key role in the political game.
It is worth looking in more detail at tactical voting. In the two seats the
Liberal Democrats gained the Labour vote stayed almost still. In the seats
which they nearly won the Labour vote went up (Wight &amp; Hampshire South up 8
per cent, Wiltshire North and Bath up 5 per cent, Devon &amp; Plymouth East up 3
per cent, Dorset &amp; Hampshire West up 3 per cent, Sussex East &amp; Kent South up
5 per cent).
Labour voters have not got the message about how to defeat the
Conservatives. Of course, they could be right: in Essex North, they jumped
from third to first place. But elsewhere there is no doubt that the
sympathetic publicity that Labour has received since John Smith's death
seriously damaged Liberal Democrat hopes.
Labour's 62 MEPs, two more than the Conservatives had in their 1979
Euro-triumph, will have a powerful impact, not only on the balance of forces
in the Strasbourg Parliament but also on the party domestically. They will
bring administrative resources in the regions and will make themselves heard
in the Parliamentary Labour Party.
The seven new Labour MEPs from Kent, Essex, Hertfordshire and east Anglia
will also fill a gap in the party's representation in an area where they now
have only 3 MPs.
Conservative MEPs had some difficulty in making themselves heard at
Westminster. But the defeats in Cumbria, Central Lancashire and Lincolnshire
will further dull any northern voice in Britain's predominantly southern
government.
The Liberal Democrats came second nowhere except Sheffield. They do look
like a regional party. But then so do the Conservatives.
The nationalist challenge is impressive. Plaid Cymru made no gains but it
emerged as a serious challenger in two of the five Welsh seats. Dafydd
Wigley's vote increase from 13 to 33 per cent since 1992 was remarkable.
Still more remarkable was the SNP's crushing victory in North East Scotland
with an increase from 26 to 42 per cent. Winnie Ewing enjoyed a 40 per cent
margin in the Highland and Islands. The SNP only sank to the third in
Scotland South where they missed second place by 500 votes. Their 32 per
cent share of the vote was the highest they have yet achieved in a
Scotland-wide test.
The Conservatives on 14 per cent of the Scottish vote have plumbed new
depths in an area where, back in 1979, they won five of the eight
Euro-seats.
The regional map is certainly far from uniform, with large areas of
wasteland for each of the parties. But the national swing is surprisingly
uniform. The percentage increase in Labour's vote was up 12 per cent in the
Midlands and 13.9 per cent in London.
The nature of Labour's victory is evident in one statistic which has its
implications for the next Euro-election: 52 out of Labour's 62 victors got
over 40 per cent of the vote. Only three of the 18 Conservative MEPs topped
40 per cent. The other 15 struggled home in three-way splits.
Politicians with marginal seats try to make their mark and struggle to keep
their leaders on a popular path. We may be hearing more from our MEPs.

FT  14 JUN 94 / European Elections: Greens wilt from 14.9% to 3.2%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Green party campaigners were hiding their disappointment yesterday as it
became clear that the party's showing in the European election fell far
short of its 1989 triumph, even though it escaped the annihilation which
some predicted.
Mr Chris Rose, Green party election agent, said last night at the party's
headquarters in Balham, south London, that the party 'would like to have got
more candidates over the 5 per cent mark'. But he added: 'It's democracy, so
we can't complain.'
The Greens polled 3.2 per cent of the vote compared with the 14.9 per cent
they achieved in 1989. The result is an improvement on the party's 1.3 per
cent in the 1992 general election, but worse than the 5 per cent it managed
in the local elections last month.
The 1989 success was largely due to the prominence of green issues following
the 1986 Chernobyl explosion and the death of North Sea seals. Since 1989
the recession has pushed their concerns down the political agenda - with
issues such as unemployment and health more prominent. Green party
candidates believe that the lack of a proportional representation system has
discouraged many who voted Green last time. Mr Rose said: 'People like to
vote for a party they think will win.'
The party fielded 84 candidates, covering all but three of the seats. Only
three candidates broke through the 5 per cent barrier and kept their
deposits. Ms Jean Lambert, the party chair, achieved the best result with
6.4 per cent of the vote in London North East.
The party won 5.6 per cent in Herefordshire and Shropshire, and 5 per cent
in Sussex South and Crawley.
According to party organisers the loss of Pounds 81,000 in deposits in other
constituencies will not rattle the cash-strapped central administration. Mr
Rose said: 'The money was raised locally and lost locally, and we regard it
as spent well in promoting our case.'
The decline in green fortunes was repeated, although less dramatically,
across Europe. Greens won 23 seats in the new European parliament, compared
with 27 in the assembly just ended, and 30 in the 1989 assembly.

FT  14 JUN 94 / European Elections: SNP hopes to coast on to win Smith seat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Scottish National party was yesterday celebrating what it called a
historic breakthrough.
It now hopes that a bandwagon effect will carry it to victory on June 30 in
the Monklands East by-election caused by the death of John Smith, who had a
majority over the nationalists of 15,712.
The SNP took the North East Scotland seat in the European parliament from
Labour with an impressive majority and substantially increased its majority
in the Highlands and Islands.
It won 32.6 per cent of the vote in the eight Scottish Euro-constituencies,
its highest share ever, crossing the 30 per cent threshold above which it
can expect to win parliamentary seats at Westminster in growing numbers. Its
share exceeded the 30.4 per cent it gained in the October 1974 general
election when it sent 11 MPs to Westminster.
The party hailed the two wins, which were complemented by robust
performances in the six Scottish seats which Labour held, as 'a staging post
on the way to independence'. In North East Scotland the SNP candidate, Mr
Allan Macartney, achieved a majority of 31,227 over Labour's Mr Henry
McCubbin, who had beaten him in 1989 by 2,613 votes. Mr Ron Harris, the
Conservative candidate, came third with 40,372 votes. In 1989 the three
parties' shares of the vote were within 4 percentage points of each other.
This time the SNP won votes from people who voted Tory in 1989, as well as
picking up some votes from Labour. The result will particularly worry the
Tories, who hold three of the Westminster seats in the Euro-constituency.
In the Highlands and Islands constituency Mrs Winnie Ewing, the veteran SNP
MEP, increased her majority from 44,695 to 54,916, taking 58.37 per cent of
the vote. Mr Michael Macmillan, the Labour candidate, pushed Mr Mark
Tennant, the Conservative candidate, into third place. Both there and in
North East Scotland the Liberal Democrat candidate was fourth.
The SNP came second in five of the six other Scottish Euro-seats, only being
narrowly beaten into third place by the Tory candidate in South of Scotland.
Its 32.6 per cent share of the Scottish vote compared with 25.5 per cent in
1989. Labour took 42.5 per cent (41.9 per cent), the Conservatives 14.5 per
cent (20.9 per cent) and the Liberal Democrats 7.2 per cent (4.3 per cent).
Mr Alex Salmond, the SNP leader, said: 'The North East result is a decisive
victory in the seat that Labour themselves called the cockpit of the
election in Scotland.
'This is a disaster for the Tories - they held this seat five years ago, and
now they are humiliated. The Tories' days of running Scotland on an English
majority are numbered.'
The SNP will tomorrow name its candidate for Monklands East.

FT  14 JUN 94 / European Elections: Lib Dems downcast by tumbling share of
vote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Paddy Ashdown and his senior colleagues were putting on a brave face for
the cameras yesterday. But Liberal Democrats were privately downcast by
their party's European election performance.
Though it achieved an important breakthrough in sending its first MEPs to
Strasbourg, the party's share of the vote, at slightly above 16 per cent,
was more than one percentage point down on the last general election and
more than 10 points down on the local elections last month.
Its tally of two European seats - although in line with the target the party
had set itself at the start of the campaign - was right at the bottom end of
forecasters' projections.
As the bronzed Liberal Democrat leader saw it, the results showed that the
party had made 'steady progress' and had emerged as the clear challenger in
the remaining Tory 'redoubt' in southern and south-west England.
Britain was 'a rather Euro-sceptical nation', he acknowledged. This, plus
the fact that large constituencies tend to discourage tactical voting, made
European elections 'our most difficult hand to play'.
Others were less sanguine about the outcome, albeit in private.
One senior party worker described the result as 'terrible'. Another
prominent figure said: 'Nationally, it was very disappointing.'
Some activists spoke of their fears that the outcome could be bad enough to
trigger fresh defections to Labour, after the example of Mr Alec Kellaway,
the Liberal Democrat candidate in the Newham North East parliamentary
by-election who sensationally rejoined Labour on the eve of last week's
by-election.
According to one activist, a former member of the Social Democratic party:
'The problem is that party officials who have come via the SDP from Labour
into the Liberal Democrats are increasingly asking themselves why they are
fighting a hopeless cause.
'The option of joining the SDP Mark-Two party in Tony Blair's new-model
Labour party is becoming increasingly attractive.'
Mr Ashdown publicly laughed off the notion that Mr Kellaway could turn out
to be a trend-setter, rather than a maverick. But officials conceded in
private that the threat of defections would hang over the party unless it
could quickly prove that its bandwagon had not come to a halt.
In an effort to keep the momentum going, several pre-planned mailshots will
go out this week to constituency chairmen and other local activists in
Liberal Democrat target seats in the south urging them to keep telling
voters that Labour cannot win in their areas.
'We will be using these results in the south and south-west in our target
seats to put the squeeze on Labour,' said Mr Matthew Taylor, the Liberal
Democrat campaign co-ordinator.

FT  14 JUN 94 / European Elections: Currie blames 'thumping' tax increases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
She was chirpy enough when she arrived in bright sunshine yesterday morning
at the count for the Bedfordshire and Milton Keynes seat.
Mrs Edwina Currie looked immaculate in a pink summer suit with perfectly
coiffured hair and two rows of pearls around her neck. It was smiles all
around from her entourage - husband, teenage daughter and agent.
After half an hour talking to Conservative party officials in Luton sports
centre, however, she looked rather more solemn.
No, she would not be coming out to talk to journalists, who had been banned
from the hall and were crammed cheek-by-jowl on a small balcony overlooking
it. She would talk to the press after the count.
When she emerged briefly for a cup of coffee in the cafeteria, she was
decidedly ratty.
Asked how things were looking she replied: 'Can't tell. Go away.'
By this time it must have been obvious that not only was she going to lose a
seat held for the Conservatives in 1984 and 1989 by Mr Peter Beazley - but
that she was going to lose quite badly.
And so it turned out. Labour candidate Ms Eryl McNally, a schoolteacher from
Watford, scored a thumping 94,837 votes, 33,000 more than Mrs Currie and 48
per cent of the vote. Mrs Currie took 61,628 or 30.2 per cent of the vote.
The swing is difficult to estimate because the boundaries had been changed
since the last European election in 1989. Mrs Currie's agent estimated,
however, that on the basis of the last general election there had been a 9
per cent swing against her.
After the vote Mrs Currie blamed the low turnout of 38 per cent.
'We have been victims of the militant abstainer,' she said. 'My team has
been magnificent, but getting the voters out has been like drawing teeth.'
She also said, in an apparent swipe at the government: 'It does not help if
on the day you start campaigning, the government imposes thumping great tax
increases. I hope the message has gone home in the right quarters. The
Labour party should not take the next general election for granted.'
By the time Mrs Currie agreed to interviews she was in better humour. She
signally failed to endorse Mr Major, saying only: 'There has to be a next
prime minister, but speculation just detracts from the job in hand.'
Ms McNally ascribed her victory to dissatisfaction with the government and
the Labour party's marked preference for a positive agenda in Europe. She
admitted, however, that she had been the beneficiary of tactical voting by
potential Liberal Democrat voters, saying she had 'definitely been lent'
some votes by possible Lib Dem supporters.
Mrs Currie refused to be drawn on her future. Asked what her relationship
will be with her Commons constit-uency in Derbyshire, she said: 'I certainly
do not regard Derbyshire as second best. I had lots of support for my stance
on Europe from my constituency.'

FT  14 JUN 94 / European Elections: Appeal considered after spoiling tactic
costs seat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The most justifiably disappointed candidate in southern England yesterday
was Mr Adrian Sanders, who stood for the Liberal Democrats in Devon and East
Plymouth.
He failed to defeat the defending Tory candidate by only 700 votes.
Meanwhile, a Literal Democrat won no fewer than 10,200.
The Liberal Democrats believe the Literal Democrat cost them the seat and an
appeal to the electoral court is being considered. 'It was a spoiling
tactic,' said Mr Nick Rijke, the party's campaign manager. 'On polling day
we had people ringing up to say they had made a dreadful mistake.'
Elsewhere, the party's ambitions were frustrated in all but two seats by the
strength of Labour's performance. In Devon and East Plymouth, for example,
Labour polled over 47,000 votes. While the Liberal Democrats apparently
gained most in the south from the steep fall in the Green vote, compared
with 1989, the party gained less from tactical voting than was expected.
'Despite massive attempts by the Liberal Democrats right across the south of
England to squeeze our vote, it just didn't happen,' said Mr Graham Manuel,
Labour's regional organiser. 'Their tactic of saying voting Labour is a
wasted vote just didn't work.' He believed the message about tactical voting
became dissipated by the large size of European constituencies.
Publicly, the Liberal Democrats hoped to win only up to three seats. Mr
Paddy Ashdown, party leader, hailed as a breakthrough their success in
gaining their first European seats with big majorities - Cornwall and West
Plymouth, and Somerset and North Devon. 'We are now the clear challengers in
the Tory stronghold of the south and south-west,' he said.
Privately, his party had hoped to extend gains beyond its own natural
territory and into Tory heartlands. Yet in the Cotswolds constituency, it
was Labour which cut the 25,000 majority of Lord Plumb, the defending Tory,
to 4,200.
Labour's vote also went up in the North Wiltshire and Bath constituency, a
Liberal Democrat target. Dr Caroline Jackson, the defending Tory, held the
seat with a much reduced majority of less than 9,000.
In the Dorset and East Devon seat, the Conservatives fended off the Liberal
Democrats by only 2,200 votes, with Labour polling nearly 35,000. Labour did
well in Bristol, where Mr Ian White retained the party's only seat in the
region. Mr White, who campaigned hard for the European social chapter,
trebled his majority to nearly 30,000.
He saw Labour's performance as a consolidation of its support, rather than a
shift by anti-Tory voters who now saw Labour rather than the Liberal
Democrats as the social democratic alternative.

FT  14 JUN 94 / European Elections: Hume slashes Paisley majority
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The three sitting MEPs representing the three main strands of political
opinion in Northern Ireland have all been returned.
The Rev Ian Paisley of the hard-line Democratic Unionist party again topped
the poll, taking 29 per cent, or 163,246 of the total vote of 559,864.
However, his majority of about 14,000 in the 1989 election was reduced to
only 1,250 over Mr John Hume, leader of the mainly nationalist Social
Democratic and Labour party, who has taken the second of the seats in the
three-seat Northern Ireland constituency.
The third seat has been taken by Mr Jim Nicholson, of the Ulster Unionist
party, with 133,459 votes, or 24 per cent.
The province is unique in the UK's polling system in having the only
multi-seat constituency and the only one to use proportional representation
and the single transferable vote system.
There was a 49.4 per cent turnout, half a percen-tage point higher than in
1989.
Significantly, Mr Hume and Mr Nicholson, considered to represent moderate
viewpoints of nationalism and unionism respectively, have both made modest
but notable advances in the level of their support, while that of the
extremes has remained static.
Support for Mr Hume has gone up by 4 percentage points to 29 per cent of the
vote, and that for Mr Nicholson has advanced by 2 percentage points to 24
per cent.
Mr Paisley, who chose to run his campaign as a referendum on the Downing
Street declaration, calling on unionist opponents of the declaration to vote
for the Democratic Unionist party, has seen his overall share of the vote
slip marginally - by 1 percentage point.
Nonetheless, he claimed yesterday that he had achieved what he set out to
do, and has requested an urgent meeting with Mr John Major, the prime
minister.
Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, has seen its support advance by 1
percentage point to 10 per cent, after a significant effort to get all its
supporters out to vote.
The result will give a measure of encouragement to ministers of the British
and Irish governments, who are due to meet in Dublin this Friday to discuss
their next steps in the Northern Ireland peace process, which had been put
on hold until after the elections.
The two governments say that work on a joint 'framework document', which
will propose a series of new political structures for Northern Ireland, is
well advanced.
It is intended that this document will provide the focus for renewed
round-table talks, although the Democratic Unionist party has emphasised it
has no intention of returning to the table unless the Downing Street
declaration is repudiated by the British government.

FT  14 JUN 94 / Edmonds says unions facing cash collapse: GMB leader
forecasts 'gaps in movement'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A number of Britain's trade unions will suffer financial collapse in the
next two years, a senior union leader predicted yesterday.
Addressing the GMB general union conference in Blackpool, Mr John Edmonds,
general secretary, forecast 'a number of gaps in our trade union movement,
gaps that we and the other survivors must fill'.
Although Mr Edmonds did not mention any union, it is believed he was
thinking among others of Ucatt, the construction union which has severe
financial problems and is in merger talks with the TGWU general union.
The GMB intends to launch a recruitment drive across the labour market and
plans to establish a stronger presence in areas where it has previously been
weak.
Mr Edmonds' self-confidence has been strengthened by the results of his
union's check-off campaign.
The GMB has increased membership as a result of persuading workers to have
their subscriptions to the union deducted by their employers. 'The check-off
campaign has tested the sinews of every union; It has been the survival of
the fittest,' said Mr Edmonds. 'Not every union is doing as well as the
GMB.'
The GMB's exploratory merger talks with the TGWU have not made any progress
over the past 12 months, but Mr Edmonds made clear yesterday that his union
would develop on its own 'a new concept of trade unionism among a fragmented
and vulnerable workforce'.
He said the European Union's social legislation and the return of a Labour
government at the next general election would win 'better trade union rights
in Britain' and this would help the unions to recruit among workers in
secure jobs in the manufacturing sector. But this would 'not be enough any
more' to win support for trade unionism in small workplaces 'where
collective bargaining is some distant dream,' he added.
Recruiting in the non-unionised sector of the labour market was 'the dilemma
we must resolve before this decade is over,' Mr Edmonds said.
'We must go back to our roots' and 're-invent community unionism with the
local trading office as the centre of a network providing solidarity and
mutual support,' he told delegates.
Mr Edmonds added that 'new solidarity based on the local community' would
have 'to replace the natural solidarity of the large site.'

FT  14 JUN 94 / Stars in first beauty contest focus on union concerns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tony Blair sketched out a surprisingly detailed domestic programme for
Labour, Robert Taylor writes.
He pledged himself to the objective of re-establishing full employment, to a
national minimum wage on 'economic as well as moral grounds' to help
low-paid workers, and to a new partnership between unions and employers so
that 'social justice and economic efficiency could go hand-in-hand'.
Specific commitments in his speech included: signing up to the social
chapter of the European Union as soon as Labour came to office; giving the
same legal rights to part-time workers as to full-time workers; abolishing
by law employer blacklists of workers; returning trade unionism to the
government's communications centre at Cheltenham; and giving all workers the
right to belong to a trade union, with legal recognition for trade unions
where a substantial number of workers wanted it.
These detailed pledges pleased the delegates and indicated that Mr Blair, in
spite of the views of some of his modernising supporters, is keen to meet
trade union demands.
Mr Blair received warm applause from the delegates - though not a standing
ovation - as he called for Britain's 'national renewal' and the creation of
a 'strong, united society' based on 'bonds of social solidarity'.
Mr Blair added there must be a 'business plan for Britain' with an emphasis
on encouraging industrial investment, the creation of regional development
agencies and a new bank to help industry.
Increasingly confident as his speech developed, Mr Blair also called for a
comprehensive nursery education and childcare system so that every woman
could be free to work if she wanted to. He received loud applause for a
passionate commitment to the National Health Service and said Labour was now
the party of law and order.

Oil finds in deep water west of the Shetland Islands are 'full of promise,'
a company involved in the area said yesterday.
However, Mr Heinz Rothermund, managing director of Shell UK Exploration and
Production, a partner along with British Petroleum in the Foinaven and
Schiehallion fields, said it was too early to determine whether full-scale
development of the area will go ahead.
Speaking at the FT's North Sea conference yesterday, Mr Rothermund said the
companies plan to begin production at early as next year.

FT  14 JUN 94 / Gooda staff 'unaware of risks'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Some Gooda Walker staff who spoke to Lloyd's Names were unaware of the full
extent of the risks taken by the agency's syndicate 290 which specialised in
catastrophe insurance, Mr Derek Walker, the former chairman of the Gooda
Walker managing agency, agreed in the High Court yesterday, John Mason
writes.
Giving evidence in the action brought against Gooda Walker by more than
3,000 Names, Mr Walker also agreed that syndicate 290, which he ran
personally, was open to criticism that it had too little reinsurance, and
that he had told the agency's board that increasing reinsurance could
threaten profits.
Questioned by Mr Geoffrey Vos QC for the Names, Mr Walker agreed that some
staff who spoke to Names had seriously underestimated the risks taken in the
market by the syndicate. These included Mr Tony Gooda, the former chairman
of the members' agency.
Mr Gooda and others thought the exposure of a high-risk syndicate such as
290 would be about 25 per cent of 'stamp' or premium capacity. In fact,
under Mr Walker's control, it was up to 200 per cent.
Challenged that this might expose Names to liabilities beyond their means,
Mr Walker said it was for members' agents to make the 'necessary inquiries'
of potential Names.
Mr Walker agreed that he took on as much business as possible and then
bought what reinsurance he could and that this exposed members to
potentially large losses, he agreed.

FT  14 JUN 94 / Minister promises protection for rural post offices in
sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A regulatory framework to ensure the survival of rural post offices would
form part of any privatisation package introduced by the government, the
House of Lords was told yesterday.
Lord Strathclyde, trade and industry minister, assured peers who expressed
concern about the effect of privatisation on rural communities that they
would find a 'great deal of comfort' when the promised consultative green
paper was published. He said the document would be published soon.
Lord Strathclyde said: 'In the same way that we protected rural telephone
boxes when it came to privatisation of BT, there's absolutely no reason why
we should not do the same thing for rural post offices.'
He refused to comment when pressed to explain why, if the Post Office's
counters business could be accorded greater commercial freedom while
remaining in the public sector, the same approach could not be adopted in
the case of the Royal Mail.
Lord Strathclyde reaffirmed, however, that the maintenance of a uniform
postal rate, a universal service, and a nationwide network of services, was
'non-negotiable'.
Lord Clinton-Davis, a Labour spokesman, said that public opposition to the
privatisation of the Post Office had contributed to the government's dismal
showing in the European elections and last week's crop of by-elections for
seats in the House of Commons.
He noted with satisfaction that the government was paying a very high price
at the polls for such acts of 'political lunacy'.
Lord Strathclyde insisted that the privatisation programme had proved
successful, and added: 'Labour policies would have provided no benefit, and
substantial costs.'

FT  14 JUN 94 / Beckett speech received without great enthusiasm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The speech from Mrs Margaret Beckett, Labour's acting leader, was the
longest and dullest of the three, and had more to offer the party's
traditionalists than its modernisers, David Goodhart writes.
Speaking before the other two candidates, in the slot that would have been
filled by John Smith, Mrs Beckett was received attentively but without great
enthusiasm.
Her only direct appeal to the delegates to vote for her took the form of a
joke: 'I will make only one point in my own cause. After the next general
election we could look forward to hearing militant Tories chanting 'Maggie
Maggie Maggie - out out out]' '
After a triumphant assessment of the European election results - 'a turning
point in British history' - Mrs Beckett talked of the need for a better
balance between individual and community, but also had some meat for the
left, stressing the importance of the links between unions and the party.
'Our relationship brings reality to what can otherwise become the unreal
world of politics. And it is vital to the political problems that we as a
party must address,' she said.
She also talked of government taking a lead in industries of the future.
Modernisers would have been happier with her comments on the need to
modernise the welfare state.

FT  14 JUN 94 / Blair's lead undented following debate: Labour contenders
address US-style primary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tony Blair's apparently unstoppable advance on the Labour leadership
remained undented by a three-sided debate at the annual congress of GMB
general union last night.
Mr John Prescott, his main opponent, who appeals most to Labour's core
traditional voters, was on home ground and provided a punchy and emotional
contribution stressing his trade union past and his socialist values. But
his speech was also repetitious and poorly organised and seemed to
disappoint some of his supporters.
The GMB's US-style primary attracted surprisingly little interest among the
700 delegates. About half of them left the conference when normal business
ended in the early evening. Only a few trickled back.
Earlier Mrs Margaret Beckett, the third candidate, who took the formal slot
reserved for the Labour leader, gave a lacklustre performance. Like Mr
Prescott she stressed the importance of the union-Labour links, of full
employment and of government support for industry.
Mr Blair did little to rouse delegates. With typically fluent delivery he
stressed public-private partnership and Labour's opportunity to be the party
trusted on tax and economic management.
He talked about skills development and lifelong learning, and played to his
trade union audience by stressing his commitment to a new social partnership
at work and to the social chapter of the European Union. Most delegates
thought that he had won narrowly on points.
The GMB is a centre-right but traditionalist union. Mr John Edmonds, its
leader, has fallen out with the Labour modernisers. Neither the leadership
nor the activists are enthusiastic about Mr Blair, but up to a third of the
700 delegates would probably vote for him.
The biggest group of delegates seems set to vote for Mr Prescott with quite
a large minority, and most of the women delegates, backing Mrs Beckett. But
private polls of the union's ordinary members show almost 50 per cent
backing Mr Blair, about 30 per cent for Mr Prescott, and the rest split
between Mrs Beckett and others.
That presents the union leadership with a problem. They cannot endorse Mr
Blair because of his overt coolness towards unions - but endorsing anyone
else may make them appear out of touch.
One activist said: 'Blair doesn't stand for anything, we don't want to win
at any price.' But support for Mr Blair is not only found among the ordinary
members. GMB full-time officials are equally split between Mr Blair and Mr
Prescott.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART

<TEXT>
Mr John Prescott, who won the toss of the coin and spoke first in the
union's beauty contest, revelled in his traditionalist tag, David Goodhart
writes.
'I'm proud of my socialist values - which are as relevant in the 1990s as in
the 1940s - and I'm proud of my trade union background,' he said.
However, he also stressed his preference for policy detail rather than
rhetoric. On the issue of unemployment, he accused the Conservatives of
creating mass unemployment as a deliberate act of policy. He pledged to 'put
jobs and social justice at the top of the agenda.
'I have a hatred of mass unemployment that came from my experience as a
seaman,' he said. He added that the two wings of the Labour movement had to
continue to work closely and to place particular stress on the importance of
implementing a minimum wage.
'We cannot compete by becoming a low-wage skivvy economy,' he said. Full
employment was still feasible, but it required detailed plans to achieve.
Otherwise it would lack credibility.
Answering questions after his contribution, Mr Prescott refused to be drawn
on the precise level for a minimum wage. But he reiterated his support for
the principle. and said that he had lived on a minimum wage while a hotel
worker.

FT  14 JUN 94 / European Elections '94: German presidency has new dimension
 -Overcoming structural weakness and unemployment heads the agenda
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TYLL NECKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The German government assumes the six-monthly presidency of the European
Union next month - at the same time as the fourth directly elected European
Parliament takes up its duties. It does so at at time when, in line with the
Maastricht treaty, the decision-making and supervisory powers of the newly
elected parliament have been enlarged.
EU policies have taken on a significance for Germany that in many spheres is
equivalent to that of national policies. More than 60 per cent of the
legislation affecting business and consumer affairs is now determined at a
European level, and is thus dependent on the European Parliament's
decisions. To give the parliament a broad democratic basis, German industry
made clear during the campaign that it favoured a high turnout in the
elections on Sunday.
The German presidency and the new parliament will be starting their work at
a time of great political and economic challenge.
After the large-scale upheavals which have taken place in Europe during the
last few years, including the reunification of Germany, the task now is to
press forward along the path of European integration.
The main item on the agenda is to strengthen Europe's position as a centre
for economic activity by overcoming points of structural weakness and
reducing unemployment.
Last December, the European Council drew up an action plan based on the
Commission's white paper on growth, competitiveness, and employment. That
provides the foundations for a successful common strategy during the medium
term, which should reinforce companies' competitiveness and increase
employment.
Broad-based investment and a clear reduction in unemployment can be attained
only if companies are able to stand up to increasingly intense international
competition.
To achieve that aim requires: a reduction in the burdens of taxes and other
levies on European companies, which are very high by international
standards; more flexibility in labour markets; deregulation and
privatisation of many important areas, such as telecommunications, energy,
and transport; improvements in infrastructure, making use of private as well
as public sector capital; and promotion of innovation by means of
well-coordinated and application-orientated research and development
policies.
From the point of view of German industry, the German presidency of the EU
should aim to press forward speedily and consistently with the aim of
completing the single market programme.
Of the measures putting the programme in place, 95 per cent have now been
agreed. However, across the EU, only 87 per cent of the measures have been
placed on the statute book, so the single market cannot yet said to be fully
operational.
Moreover, only 50 per cent of the measures have come into effect in all 12
member states. Partnership and co-operation are necessary to ensure that
single market rules are applied in an efficient and even-handed manner. That
is the only way to overcome competitive distortions.
Consolidating the single market also requires harmonisation of tax policies
and reduction of fiscal hindrances. Action is called for to end burdens on
industry stemming from provisional VAT rules. This would require a decision
on a new system for country-of-origin VAT collection.
Fiscal barriers for cross-border capital transactions and corporate
restructuring must also be removed. A well-functioning joint export control
regime is also needed, encompassing so-called 'dual use' goods ie. those
capable of both military and civilian applications.
Another priority is cross-border environmental protection. Common policies
are required to control and to prevent environmental problems, particularly
with regard to waste disposal but also with recycling and with the re-use of
materials.
There is further need for action in the European Union's external relations,
of utmost importance for assuring competitiveness. There may well be
important landmarks here in the application of the Gatt Uruguay Round
agreement, as well as in the establishment of the World Trade Organisation.
The EU needs to assume a leadership role in this respect alongside the US.
The Union's trade policy must be strongly geared to the principles of
multilateralism and openness towards the rest of the world. The leading
industrialised countries' trade policy will be credible only if they refuse
to countenance one-sided, discriminatory measures or threats of sanctions.
A decisive point for Europe's external relations will be the extension of
trade and industrial co-operation with the reform-minded states of central
and eastern Europe. The German EU presidency should devote special energy to
supporting these countries' economic reform efforts.
In line with the principle of 'self-help', trade and economic co-operation
can provide the right conditions to allow these countries themselves to
generate the revenues needed to finance these reforms.
Another central issue for the German presidency will be preparing the
conference to review the Maastricht treaty in 1996. Here I anticipate
improvements on the details of the treaty as well as decisive steps towards
developing European integration. In particular, we must meet the challenges
associated with enlargement towards some of the Efta states and further
economic and political rapprochement with central and eastern Europe.
It is important to extend the European parliament's co-decision rights. Such
reinforcement forms an essential part of efforts to strengthen the EU's
democratic structures and to increase further the parliament's involvement
in the European integration process.

FT  14 JUN 94 / European Elections '94: Long road to true democracy - Vernon
Bogdanor questions the legitimacy of a system that fails to mobilise popular
consent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VERNON BOGDANOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The 1994 elections to the European parliament raise two questions. The first
is whether direct elections are able to confer democratic legitimacy to the
European enterprise. The second is whether that enterprise has any chance of
succeeding without a radical change of direction.
The most striking feature of the elections is the small percentage of
Europeans who can be bothered to vote. In 1979, 63 per cent of electors in
the Community voted in the first elections for the European parliament. This
disappointingly low turnout was ascribed to the parliament's lack of powers,
an excuse no longer available.
Yet, in 1994, for the third successive election, overall turnout fell - to
56.5 per cent compared with 58.5 per cent in 1989 and 61 per cent in 1984.
Given that voting in three countries - Belgium, Greece and Luxembourg - is
compulsory, it is probable that only a minority of electors were voluntarily
prepared to offer even that minimal endorsement of European Union symbolised
by the act of voting.
The parliament, it is now clear, is unable to create a European
consciousness among the electors. This failing is not contingent, but
inherent in the operation of European institutions.
Domestic elections succeed in conferring legitimacy because they fulfil
three functions. They offer the voter a choice of government, a choice of
who should lead that government, and the choice of a set of policies.
European parliament elections fulfil none of these functions. The government
of the Union is shared between the Council of Ministers and the Commission
but the composition of neither of these bodies is affected by European
elections.
The leadership of the Union, in the guise of the person who will succeed Mr
Jacques Delors as president of the Commission, is decided, not by the
voters, but by backstairs dealing between the governments of the
member-states. The future policies of the Union are decided through
bargaining by the political leaders of the core member states - France,
Germany, and Spain.
Rather than conferring democratic legitimacy to the European project,
European parliament voting has thus become a series of separate national
elections, or rather perhaps national opinion polls, with the function of
charting the changing fortunes of the main domestic political forces. Even
here, the elections are deeply flawed owing to Britain's stubborn insistence
on maintaining its first-past-the-post system.
Can the European Parliament really claim a mandate to represent the opinion
of its 269m voters, when it is supported by just over half of these voters,
and when its representation is so distorted?
If there has been one noticeable transnational trend in these elections, it
has been the success of the right in three of the five large member-states
of the Union - Germany, Italy and Spain. Yet, because of the exaggerative
effects of the British electoral system, the UK Labour party will be by far
the largest party in the parliament, and the Socialists the largest of the
party groups.
There is a striking contrast between the progressive transfer of competences
to the European Parliament and the lack of popular involvement of the
European electorate. The failure to mobilise popular consent is the main
weakness of the European project.
If the Union continues to transfer further competences to a European level
and extends majority voting in the Council of Ministers, it will become
further alienated from those it claims to represent.
In reality, the development of the EU has revealed a more fundamental chasm
in European politics than that between right and left, more profound even
than that between Europhiles and Eurosceptics. It has opened up the most
dangerous of political divides, that between the people and the political
class.
In Britain, France, Germany and Italy, all the main political parties have
favoured the European enterprise although large minorities of the population
are against it. With no legitimate outlet for anti-Europeanism, voters will
turn to less respectable alternatives, the National Front in France in 1984
and 1989, Germany's Republicans in 1989, and, in Italy, Mr Silvio Berlusconi
and his neo-fascist allies in 1994.
The European Parliament, intended as a counterweight to the bureaucratic and
technocratic elements of the Union, has become, as perceived by its
electors, a part of that very technostructure.
Any reform of the EU's institutions must begin by giving the electorate of
Europe the power to choose its government. One way to achieve this is by
direct election of the Commission. But that would require a treaty
amendment. In the current climate, this would not be passed.
Under Article 138 of the Treaty of Rome, elections to the parliament are to
be conducted by a uniform electoral procedure in all of the states. If
Britain could be persuaded to agree to this provision, it would be possible
to produce common transnational lists for the European elections.
It could then be accepted that the winning lists should form the Commission,
which would be composed of members of one political colour, and could thus
could offer the political leadership that Europe so badly needs.
The European elections of 1994 mark the end of the road for a particular
conception of Europe, one symbolised by the benign despotism of Delors.
The elections none the less constitute both a challenge and an opportunity
for European leaders. The opportunity is to help create a European
consciousness, without which the construction of Europe cannot even be
contemplated, let alone completed.

FT  14 JUN 94 / European Elections '94: MEPs should force the pace to create
Emu - The single currency deadline can be met
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN COLLIGNON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The advantages of a single European currency for lowering transaction costs,
supporting competition, and reducing uncertainties are well known. The new
members of the European parliament must explain these advantages to their
electorates and must reassure them of the soundness of the planned
transition to economic and monetary union (Emu).
By June 1999, when the new MEPs seek re-election, a European central bank
will probably have started to issue Ecus for the first group of countries to
embark on monetary union.
During the last two years, the European Monetary System (EMS) has seen
drama. But the rationale for Emu is unchanged. None of the remaining ERM
participants has used the wider bands to cut interest rates excessively or
to engineer competitive devaluations.
After last summer's crisis, many officials saw countries' willingness to
continue stability-oriented policies as a test of the political and economic
philosophy behind Emu. The core countries have passed that test with flying
colours. Will they be able to transfer to a single currency as early as
1997?
A majority of countries (Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland,
Luxembourg, the Netherlands) already fulfils the purely financial criteria
set by the treaty. They have low inflation, long-term interest rate
convergence and relatively stable exchange rates.
However, greater fiscal efforts are necessary to bring deficits into the 3
per cent range set down by the treaty.
Lower debt/GDP ratios are also necessary. More time may be needed to achieve
convergence. That does not jeopardise the target of a single currency this
century.
Central bank co-operation must also improve in the approach to the final
stage of Emu. The European central bank will be responsible for conduct of
monetary policy from the first day of stage three. That implies it will have
to supply the banking system with Ecu liquidity through the existing money
markets. It can do so efficiently only if these markets are fully integrated
beforehand.
That in turn requires the convergence not only of long-term interest rates -
as stipulated by Maastricht - but also of short-term rates. One way to
achieve such convergence is to define common money supply targets for the
countries of the stability zone, and then to stop sterilising capital flows
between them.
The history of the EMS indicates that during the 1980s successful
disinflation was linked to some kind of income policy in many countries. The
European Parliament could help reduce unemployment and pave the way for
economic convergence by stimulating a debate about the need to link pay
increases to productivity growth.
The European Parliament should monitor the removal of Ecu obstacles. MEPs
could create an independent panel of economists and 'wise men' to assess
progress. Above all, MEPs can be useful in creating a European-wide
consensus about the stability required for Emu to be successful.

FT  14 JUN 94 / European Elections '94: Parliament must play to its
strengths - Pauline Green hopes MEPs will make the most of their powers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAULINE GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The votes have been counted. The new parliament starts work on July 19. Can
it make the most of its new powers? Or will it sink into oblivion for the
next five years?
The parliament has strengths and weaknesses, some not of its own making. It
must play to its strengths and try to eliminate those handicaps that can be
eliminated.
Some weaknesses are inherent. The need to work in nine (soon 12) languages
means that debates will never have the cut and thrust of the House of
Commons.
Where the parliament does well, however, is in influencing legislation and
carrying out the nitty-gritty of parliamentary scrutiny, shaping the budget
and monitoring and questioning civil servants' actions.
Every year the parliament adopts thousands of amendments to draft
legislation, reshaping the laws that affect us in important areas such as
consumer protection, environmental standards, social legislation, equal
opportunities and banking. Through its budgetary powers it redirects
spending to priority areas.
Even before Maastricht reinforced its powers, most parliamentary amendments
ended up on the statute book in directives and regulations adopted by the
Council of Ministers. Under Maastricht, important areas of legislation fall
under the 'co-decision' procedure and are adopted jointly by parliament and
the Council. Parliament's influence on legislation can only grow.
In particular, the right to say 'no' - to veto draft legislation, to blow
the whistle on behalf of our constituents - will be crucial for the
parliament's public perception.
Some national parliaments act virtually as a rubber stamp in adopting
legislation proposed by governments. In this respect, the European
parliament does better than many national parliaments.
National governments want parliament to continue with the ludicrous system
of spreading its activities over three countries. Most parliamentary work is
carried out in Brussels, but once a month the whole show moves to Strasbourg
for plenary sittings, and a large proportion of the secretariat is based in
Luxembourg.
Brussels should be the single site of parliament's activities, close to the
other institutions it has to scrutinise, and in the same town as the
European press corps, representatives of interest groups and member states'
embassies.
Another problem is that the treaties negotiated and ratified by national
governments now include far too many complex procedures for involving
parliament in European legislation.
The 1996 conference should seek to simplify and standardise these rules by
applying a streamlined co-decision procedure to all areas where Council
adopts legislation by a qualified majority.
The press, too, having frequently pointed to parliament's increased
importance, must follow this up by increased coverage.
The parliament should also put its own house in order. A good start was made
last year with a complete overhaul of the rules of procedure, allowing
parliament to concentrate its time on more important matters where it has
power, to limit possibilities for filibustering by small groups, and to
improve management.
In the new parliament, the centre-right will be far more divided and
fragmented, with an extreme right contingent introducing instability and
even conflict. Handling this will present a challenge. Even more than in the
past, the Socialist group will have to lead the parliament, despite the
absence of an overall majority for any group.
All in all, the new parliament has a good chance of using its new powers
effectively. The big question is how national governments will handle the
1996 constitutional revision. We look forward to seeing how they face up to
their responsibilities.

FT  14 JUN 94 / European Elections '94: Making the Union truly pan-European
 -Test must be loyalty to shared ideals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PERTTI SALOLAINEN

<TEXT>
In 1923, the Bohemian Count Richard Coudenhove-Kalergi wrote in his book Pan
Europa: 'To rationalise the European economy we have to create an internal
European market. Only that way can Europe achieve high wages, low prices and
great turnover.' Already during those chaotic days after the Great War,
economic convergence was seen by many as the only means to ensure lasting
peace and prosperity.
Today a single market exists for the European Union. Additionally, we have
created the European Economic Area, by which the single market is extended
to the wealthier European non-EU countries. The EU has negotiated
co-operation agreements with central and eastern Europe.
However, the real question is whether the European Union will some day
become pan-European. I believe that the real Europeanism of the 21st century
must embrace and extend the values of liberalism, pluralism, tolerance, and
rationality throughout the continent.
A multi-track Europe is already more a reality than a threat. EU divergences
are apparent. It is difficult to see how all the present member states could
satisfy the criteria for the adoption of a single currency by January 1
1999. In the Visegrad countries, or the former Soviet Union, the picture is
still more fragmented.
The EU should be genuinely open to all European nations that share the
common ideals of peace and prosperity. The question of when and how steps to
enlarge the EU should be taken has to be solved case-by-case. The Union must
function efficiently and in a co-ordinated way. Our aim is to promote
forward-looking co-operation.
Finland's membership of the European Union is a matter of stability and
independence. Stability, because Europe needs the kind of stability that
only integrated co-operation can produce. Independence, because by joining
the EU we can best influence our own destinies.
For Europe, Finland's membership will strengthen the EU's role as a
political and economic anchor.
On October 16, we will be holding a national referendum on EU membership.
Under the Finnish constitution, such a referendum is only advisory, but the
Finnish government will consider the outcome politically binding.
Sceptics must realise that in an interdependent world no nation can survive
in isolation. That was also the lesson of the Austrian referendum result on
Sunday, which I warmly welcome.
To preserve sovereignty, Finland needs a secure, equitable place in the
decision-making process that will decide its future.

FT  14 JUN 94 / European Elections '94: Occhetto decision sets up tough
leadership fight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Achille Occhetto yesterday announced he was resigning from the leadership
of the former communist Party of the Democrat Left (PDS) in the wake of his
party's poor performance in the Euro elections.
His departure opens the way for a tough leadership contest to head Italy's
main opposition party at a time when the electorate has swung sharply
towards the centre-right.
The resignation of the 58 year-old founder of the PDS also offers an
unexpected filip to the Berlusconi government as it leaves the opposition
temporarily leaderless.
In a bitter resignation letter, Mr Occhetto attacked those within the PDS
who had been sniping at his leadership ever since the party's Progressive
Alliance failed to beat Mr Silvio Berlusconi's right-wing Freedom Alliance
in the March general elections.
He had no wish to stand in the way of new blood taking over. He said that it
would be wrong that the search for an innovative role of the left should be
side-tracked by arguments about the leadership.
Mr Occhetto was the first European communist leader to break with the past
following the collapse of the Berlin Wall.
He saw the need to steer the old Italian Communist party (PCI) inspired by
the marxist teachings of Gramsci and the moderate example of the late Enrico
Berlinguer towards a social democrat platform.
The PDS was formed in February 1991 under his aegis, carrying with it the
bulk of the PCI members. A hardline rump refused to join the new party and
subsequently formed Reconstructed Communism.
Mr Occhetto underestimated the appeal of Mr Berlusconi's anti-communism and
his own identification with the old political system.
Among those tipped for the leadership race are Mr Massimo D'Alema, Mr
Occhetto's long-standing heir who suffers from a humourless public image,
and Mr Walter Veltroni, the clever young editor of L'Unita, once the PCI
mouthpiece and now a daily of the left. An interesting outsider is Mr
Massimo Cacciari, the philosopher mayor of Venice and former deputy.
The Italian list of Euro-deputies was not available last night due to the
proportional system that has voters balloting for lists of candidates.
Twelve of the leading politicians were present on the lists in all five
electoral colleges.

FT  14 JUN 94 / European Elections '94: Berlusconi achieves target - Italy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Silvio Berlusconi obtained precisely what he wanted from the European
elections and as a result has further strengthened his position as prime
minister.
Heading a heterogeneous government no more than a month old, Mr Berlusconi
had to obtain two things. He needed to boost the share of the vote of Forza
Italia, the political movement he founded in January, to demonstrate his
popularity; and he needed to see his own position reinforced in relation to
his other two main partners in government - the populist Northern League of
Mr Umberto Bossi and the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance of Mr Gianfranco
Fini.
Anything less than this would have been seen as a cooling of electoral
enthusiasm for his centre-right government which has unveiled only a handful
of policy initiatives. At this stage he should still be at the height of his
honeymoon with the electorate.
But Mr Berlusconi certainly gambled on winning by presenting himself in all
five of Italy's electoral colleges and by ensuring that Forza Italia
splashed out large sums on the campaign. Forza Italia is believed to have
spent more than all the other parties combined. Indeed with budgets
exhausted by the March general election, most parties made remarkably little
effort, recognising Mr Berlusconi was still impregnable.
European issues scarcely figured in a lack-lustre campaign - perhaps
explaining why an electorate, among the most pro-EU, should have swung
behind a leader who is a Euro-sceptic. The election was not about Europe but
who governs Italy.
Forza Italia obtained almost one in three of all votes, raising its share of
the vote by over 10 percentage points. With bad weather and a 75 per cent
turnout (low by Italian standards) this was an impressive performance and
will undoubtedly confirm Mr Berlusconi's public image as a winner.
All the other parties of any note, whether in the government or among the
opposition, lost ground. The former communist Party of the Democratic Left
(PDS), the main opposition party, slipped two percentage points to just
below 20 per cent - a poor performance which is bound to poison the already
bitter behind - the - scenes debate on who should succeed Mr Achille
Occhetto who resigned as leader yesterday. The centre was further squeezed
as support slipped to Forza Italia.
It was also significant that the League slipped in its northern heartland at
the expense of Forza Italia, especially in the cities. In a little more than
two months in Milan the League share of the vote fell from 16 per cent to 11
per cent, in Venice from 14 to 8 per cent. Mr Berlusconi was quick to
insinuate this was the product of Mr Bossi's provocative disloyalty in the
government coalition, constantly sniping at Forza Italia and the MSI.
But the decline in the League's fortunes is explicable by other factors as
well. It was the sole centre party in the north representing a genuine break
with the past until the advent of Forza Italia, created by another
northerner with northern values of hard work and free enterprise.
Forza Italia has become an attractive alternative for those who dislike and
mistrust the League's regional narcissism and wish to see a renovated
version of the old Christian Democrat Party ruling Italy.
On the basis of Sunday's result, the government coalition has not just a
parliamentary majority but a majority of the vote. More important, Forza
Italia and the MSI combined have almost 45 per cent of the national vote,
which would probably give them a parliamentary majority.
Mr Berlusconi need not consider the unpredictable League a permanent partner
and the pressure is on Mr Bossi to be co-operative. However, he knows that
co-operating too long in government could submerge the League's identity and
his own political career.

The accumulated discredit from corruption scandals has eaten away at the
Socialist vote on the centre and the left, and last-minute appeals to
ideological fidelity, to avoid the triumph of the right, failed to move a
demotivated and demoralised electorate . . . The government cannot avoid
taking these results into account: Felipe Gonzalez must call a vote of
confidence in parliament immediately, because he can only continue governing
after yesterday's setback if he makes certain of having the support to
guarantee an outright majority . . . The Popular party has inflicted a
serious defeat on the Socialists. This is an important political and
personal success for Jose Maria Aznar . . . Whatever turns out to be the way
forward, the PP has won the right to be taken into account in the
fundamental decisions of government and to participate in drawing up the
political timetable for the future.

Everybody's luck has to turn sometime. In so far as Mr John Major, the prime
minister, can be said to have pursued a coherent political strategy over the
last year that adage, in a nutshell, has been it. The question his
demoralised party is now asking itself is whether its rout in the European
elections finally marks the nadir of its fortunes? Mr Douglas Hurd, the
foreign secretary, was yesterday emphatic that it did.
The prime minister, at least, is likely to survive the debacle if only
because . . . there is no obvious successor in sight. Before he can again
consider himself secure, however, his party will require better evidence
that their fortunes will at last improve than Mr Hurd was able to proffer
yesterday. In this endeavour Mr Major might be helped by a fresher cabinet.
The present team have had their day, and should make way for newer blood.

Socialist hopes - Portugal

<TEXT>
Portugal's opposition Socialist party (PS) narrowly defeated the Social
Democratic party (PSD) of prime minister Anibal Cavaco Silva but failed to
mobilise a significant protest vote against a government beset by recession.
The margin, of less than half a percentage point, has frustrated the hopes
of Mr Antonio Guterres, the PS leader, of using the Europe elections as a
springboard for victory in a general election scheduled for October 1995.
The centre-left PS increased its share of the vote from 28.5 per cent in the
previous European elections to 34.8 per cent, electing 10 deputies to the
European parliament, compared with eight in 1989. But the centre-right PSD
also achieved a gain of 1.7 percentage points to 34.4 per cent and
maintained nine MEPs. The PS's gains were largely at the expense of the
communist CDU coalition, which lost one of its four seats. The PS also won
the extra seat allotted to Portugal, whose number of MEPs has risen from 24
to 25.
After nine years of PSD rule and almost two years of recession, the PS was
banking on a more convincing victory to gain credibility as an alternative
government party. The margin of less than 13,000 votes may be insufficient
to fend off challenges to Mr Guterres's leadership.
Figures published before the election indicate the recession has not yet
bottomed out as the government had forecast. Real wages have fallen sharply
and unemployment is steadily rising. Farmers have seen cuts in production
and earnings during the past three years. Industry struggles to compete
within the single market.
Turnout fell to 35.7 per cent, compared with 51.3 per cent in 1989, the
lowest for any election in Portugal since democracy was restored in 1975.
Abstention was aggravated by the allure of sunny beaches during a bank
holiday weekend. But it also reflected both the failure of the main parties
to inspire widespread support and the European Parliament's lack of
significance to Portuguese voters.

Silvio Berlusconi's victory in the European elections, his second electoral
success in two months, has provided a full endorsement for his government.
It is essential that this is fully understood not just because the prime
minister chose to make these elections a referendum on the permanence of his
government. In a country like Italy which has witnessed a brusque
decapitation of its political class and a redefinition of its political
landscape, the ballot box on the very first occasion was bound to be a test
of whether voters confirmed or had second thoughts about their preferences,
The outcome is more than a mere stabilisation of this new political
situation. Berlusconi and Forza Italia have now grown to encompass more or
less one-third of the entire electorate. Berlusconi can govern (as he has
sought but has not always been able to do). . . or he would be perfectly
entitled to call fresh elections.

The voting public has delivered a healthy dose of shock treatment to the
(Fianna Fail-Labour) coalition partners in both the European elections and
the by-elections in Mayo West and Dublin South Central. For some time there
has been more than a whiff of arrogance from this government.
. . . the hope must be that the election results will bring the government
back down to earth . . . The public showed its distaste for the old order in
other ways. The strong performance of Ms Patricia McKenna (of the Green
party) in Dublin has underlined how the public is casting around for
candidates out of the mainstream who will shake up the political
establishment. For Fianna Fail there will have to be a great deal of
soul-searching . . . The public is not convinced that the government is
addressing the issues that really concern them, specifically the
unemployment crisis.

Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen's Social Democratic party was dealt a
bloody nose, winning only 15.8 per cent of the vote compared with 23.3 per
cent in 1989 and losing one of its four seats in Strasbourg.
The SDP, whose supporters are not as pro-European as its leaders, lost
heavily to the alliance of two anti-European movements, the People's
Movement Against the EU and the June Movement. The two groups scored a total
of 25.5 per cent compared with 18.9 per cent won by the People's Movement in
1989 (the June Movement is a newcomer), but the two failed to win an extra
seat and retain a total of four.
The election was not a clean sweep for the anti-European cause, however. The
two pro-European opposition parties, the Liberals and Conservatives, each
picked up an extra seat, 'an excellent result,' commented Mr Uffe
Ellemann-Jensen, the Liberal leader and former foreign minister. The
Liberals went ahead to 18.9 from 16.6 per cent to win four seats.
The Conservatives, whose lead candidate was the popular former prime
minister, Mr Poul Schluter, won 17.7 per cent, against 13.3 per cent last
time, and picked up three seats. But the strongly pro-Union Centre
Democratic party, a member of the present four-party centre-left coalition
government, lost both its seats and saw its share of the vote sink to 0.9
per cent from 7.9 per cent in 1989.
The Radical Liberals (also a member of the coalition) gained a seat for the
first time by fielding a popular woman candidate, former environment
minister Ms Lone Dybkjaer, who is the present live-in companion of the prime
minister. The Euro-sceptical Social People's party held on to its single
seat although dropping to 8.6 from 9.1 per cent.

So confident was Mr Andreas Papandreou, the elderly Greek prime minister, of
victory for his Panhellenic Socialist Movement that he went to bed without
bothering to watch the results of Sunday's European Parliament elections on
television.
It was left to his spokesman to explain in the early hours why support for
Pasok had dropped by 10 percentage points since its triumphant return to
power in last October's general election.
While the Socialists easily headed the poll, capturing 37.6 per cent to 32.7
per cent for the conservative New Democracy, Greek voters had clearly
registered dissatisfaction with both big parties.
Pasok won 10 of Greece's 25 seats in the European parliament, against eight
for New Democracy, three for the nationalist Political Spring party, and two
each for the Greek Communist party and the Left Alliance.
Analysts said the results reflected widespread disappointment with the
government's unwillingness during the past eight months to grant generous
wage and pension increases and create public sector jobs for Pasok
supporters. While several thousand appointments have been made, the rising
public sector deficit inhibits the Socialists from setting up dozens of new
state enterprises as they did in the 1980s.
However, voters also signalled their concern about Pasok's future, following
repeated hints that Mr Papandreou, who is 75 and has a heart problem, may
resign as Pasok's leader and seek election next year for the ceremonial job
of president. Without the charismatic but authoritarian Mr Papandreou in
charge, Pasok's rival factions could be plunged into a messy struggle for
power.
New Democracy is embroiled in such a battle, as Mr Miltiades Evert, who took
over as leader after last year's election, tries to gain control. The
party's poor showing on Sunday is already provoking fresh criticism of his
failure to improve the conservatives' image.
The election results also underline the possibility of splinter groups
breaking away from both parties, headed by prominent personalities unwilling
to serve under an unpopular leader. Mr Evert's old-fashioned insistence on
state-oriented economic policies is trying the patience of reform-minded
conservatives. Another hammering in local government elections later this
year would speed their departure to form a new party.
The biggest gains on Sunday were made by Political Spring, the nationalist
party led by Mr Antonis Samaras, a former foreign minister who brought the
conservative government down last year by persuading several ND deputies to
defect. With 8.7 per cent of the vote, almost double its share in the
general election, Political Spring's efforts to attract voters in their 20s
and 30s appear to have paid off.
Yet the strength of the protest vote also propelled both the Greek
communists, still unswervingly Stalinist, and the small Left Alliance party
back into the European parliament, with 6.3 and 6.2 per cent of the vote
respectively. Record numbers of votes also went to fringe parties with no
hope of winning seats, among them environmental groups, rightwing extremists
and the newly formed Leftwing Resistance to the European Union.

FT  14 JUN 94 / European Elections '94: Christian Democrats cling on, but
voters stay home - Netherlands

<TEXT>
The outcome of the Dutch elections for the European Parliament brought an
unexpected victory for the Christian Democrats, partly softening the blow of
their bruising defeat a month earlier in the country's general election.
The Christian Democrats won an unchanged 10 seats, making the party of
outgoing prime minister Ruud Lubbers the largest Dutch party in the European
assembly. This marks a recovery from the May general election, when the
Christian Democrats were replaced as the biggest party in the Netherlands by
Labour.
Labour won eight seats in the European Parliament, also unchanged from their
1989 result. However, Dutch representation in the European Parliament has
increased to 31 seats from 25, meaning that both parties have seen relative
declines in popularity.
Voter turnout for the Dutch Euro-elections fell to a record low of 35.6 per
cent, down sharply from 47 per cent five years ago. Mr Frits Castricum, a
successful Labour candidate, said, 'With this kind of turnout, we all lose.'
As in the general election, the biggest gains were recorded by D66, a
left-of-centre party which jumped to four seats from one in 1989, and the
right-wing Liberals, who doubled their previous three seats.
The Christian Democrats hope their recovery at the polls may mean a small
boost to Mr Lubbers' chances of succeeding Mr Jacques Delors as president of
the European Commission.
The campaign was short and subdued and marked by 'voter fatigue' after
municipal elections in March and the general election in May.
Unfortunately for the Christian Democrats, the low level of voting means the
election cannot be seen as a protest against the continuing efforts by the
other three parties - Labour, the Liberals and D66 - to form a new national
government without them.
Still, the Christian Democrats seem to have learned their lesson from their
showing in the general election, when their support for a freeze of the
state old-age pension caused an uproar.

FT  14 JUN 94 / European Elections '94: Bad omens for presidential polls -
France
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
France's Euro-election results were yesterday being read mainly for what
they portend for next May's presidential election, the ultimate prize in
French politics.
The omens are worst for Mr Michel Rocard who led his Socialist party to its
lowest vote score (14.5 per cent) since the early 1970s. This has reawakened
interest in the candidacy of Mr Jacques Delors as the only plausible
alternative Socialist standard-bearer for the Elysee. The European
Commission president said yesterday he was still 'absolutely' loyal to Mr
Rocard, and there is no reason to disbelieve him. But the fact that this
loyalty cannot be proved until December - when Mr Delors leaves his Brussels
post - gives Mr Rocard a difficult six months to come.
However, Sunday's vote also threatens to prise the centre-right apart. The
official Euro-list of the governing UDF-RPR coalition gained only 25.5 per
cent of the vote. This poor performance led some senior conservatives
yesterday to question both the wisdom and necessity of trying to field a
single UDF-RPR candidate for the presidency.
This questioning bodes ill for Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, whose
presidential hopes rest very much on his supposedly consensual appeal to
both coalition parties, but well for Mr Jacques Chirac, who has the firm
launchpad of his RPR party machine and may soon use it to put his Elysee
campaign into orbit. If Mr Chirac does this and Mr Balladur, who is of the
same RPR Gaullist party, continues to sit on his hands, then one or several
presidential candidates from the UDF may emerge.
But by the time the final round in the presidential election comes around
next May, the race will probably be down to two runners, wearing the colours
of right and left. Under these circumstances, even Mr Rocard's losing
presidential score would not be less than 44-46 per cent (depending on his
right-wing rival), according to opinion polls conducted over the weekend.
These provided a forceful contrast to the fragmentation of Sunday's
Euro-vote, resulting from the proportional system which France uses only in
Euro-elections.
The two big surprise splinters emerging out of this fragmentation were the
lists of 'Energie Radicale', led by Mr Bernard Tapie, and of 'l'Autre
Europe', led by Mr Philippe de Villiers. Both scored around 12 per cent,
giving them 13 seats each in Strasbourg. Neither, however, can be regarded
as a serious presidential candidate, at least not yet.
Mr Tapie has far more pressing business to pursue than a distant dream of
the Elysee. Election to Strasbourg may provide him with additional
parliamentary immunity from investigations into his companies and
properties.
What the controversial Mr Tapie has done is to take over the small Mouvement
des Radicaux de Gauche (MRG) party, without changing its traditional
pro-Socialist orientation, to boost its support with his personal charisma.
Having him as an ally is therefore more of a judicial problem than an
ideological challenge to the Socialists. To the extent that Mr Tapie is
still out of court then, his support can probably be safely added to that of
the Socialist party proper next May.
By contrast, Mr de Villiers's anti-Maastricht appeal is a serious
ideological test to the centre-right's unity.

On one optimistic reading, these elections have been good for Europe. . .
solidly pro-European lists have, except for Italy, been reinforced.
Chancellor Kohl, to whom Europe already owes much, has held firm, while in
France the 'pro' vote has far outweighed the 'anti' vote.
But there is another more pessimistic interpretation. The new Strasbourg
parliament will be less 'European'. The level of participation in Europe
shows the rise of indifference towards the Union, and only improves when
domestic politics are most at stake - as in the desire for a change in
government in Britain, Spain, a political honeymoon period in Italy,
improvement in the German economy.
France showed itself on June 12 to be fragile, uncertain, disoriented, and
fragmented. It is being pulled apart by 'populisms'. An extreme right-wing
xenophobic nationalism continues to hang over it.

Brussels and Wallonia must, from now on, live with an extreme right like
that which Flanders and France has already suffered for several years. We
thought that we would be preserved from this peril. Now it hits us with full
force. . . These extremist tendencies cannot be eradicated in a few years.
They are the result of an entrenched malaise that demands long-term work
from the democratic parties. . . The vote for the extreme right is a cry
from people who once believed in the remedies put forward by the Socialist
party but who have been disappointed by the scandals that have cast
opprobrium on the ruling parties. These voters, often in immigrant
neighbourhoods, see 'others' as the scapegoat. The democratic parties must
not sit back and comfort themselves simply by denouncing the real danger of
the extreme right. They have to act by tackling the roots of the rot.

Austria's 'yes' to Europe would appear to run counter to the lukewarm and
dull elections campaigns for the European Parliament held in those countries
that are already members of the European Union. Still, this contradiction is
largely illusory. The Union may have its flaws, but it is indisputably a
zone of peace, stability and prosperity. This, combined with the large
common market, exerts a strong attractive pull on European countries outside
the EU.
Within the member states themselves, these achievements are taken for
granted. The main parties do not differ fundamentally on the usefulness of
European co-operation.
. . .These elections have hardly increased the legitimacy of the European
Parliament. . . The EU states must allow the formation of European parties
and make the Europarliament a full- fledged representative body.

Belgium

Many Belgians were shocked by the unexpectedly successful advance of the far
right, not only in Dutch-speaking Flanders but in francophone Wallonia. A
doubling of the Flemish Vlaams Blok vote and a sharp swing to the National
Front in Wallonia means that three of Belgium's 25 seats in the European
parliament will be occupied by the extreme right.
Vlaams Blok, the Flemish extremist party that wants independence for
Flanders, lifted its share of the vote from 6.6 per cent in 1989 to 12.6 per
cent, increasing its seats in the European parliament from one to two.
More startling - the Vlaams Blok had already made its presence felt in the
1991 national parliamentary elections - was the popularity of the National
Front in Wallonia. It won 7.9 per cent of the vote, from nothing in 1989.
Both far-right parties had campaigned on an anti-Maastricht ticket, although
few commentators yesterday believed that it was this that had encouraged
voters to support them.
Being 'anti-Maastricht' appeared to be less about opposing a federal Europe
and more about tapping into resentment prompted by the presence of so many
well-paid, tax-exempt foreigners in Belgium's capital, home to the European
Union's main insitutions.
'The essence of their appeal was that they were racist and anti-foreigners,'
said Mr Diederik Thibaut, a political analyst at Kredietbank, adding that
extreme-right parties had also benefited from general and widespread
dissatisfaction with the traditional parties.
The election's other big surprise was that the Flemish Christian Democrats -
Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene's CVP party - maintained their position as
the ruling party in Flanders.
The revamped Flemish Liberal party - the VLD - had threatened to upset the
CVP's hegemony, untouched since the last war, a threat backed up by opinion
polls over the past two years.
In fact, the CVP share of the vote dropped to 27.4 per cent in Flanders,
from 34.1 per cent, their seats falling from five to four. The VLD
meanwhile, made only a paltry gain from 17.1 per cent of the vote to 18.4
per cent, an increase of one seat to three.
The francophone Liberals had a similarly disappointing day, their share of
the vote rising from 22.8 per cent to 24.2 per cent.
The relative strength of the CVP is good news for the ruling coalition,
should Mr Dehaene depart from the government to become president of the
European Commission. His successor, backed by Sunday's election results,
would be in a stronger position and thus better able to hold the coalition
together.
In Wallonia, the Socialist party's woes, brought on by corruption scandals,
were reflected in a massive 9 per cent drop in their share of the vote from
almost 40 per cent in the last European elections to just under 30 per cent.
'We knew we were going to lose,' said Mr Phillipe Busquin, president of the
Wallonian Socialists. 'The loss is very significant, this is not a good
result. . . we are paying for 'the affairs' and socio-economic
difficulties.'
Corruption scandals also hit the French-speaking Christian Democrats. Their
share of the vote dropped to 18.8 per cent from 21 per cent.
The Green parties - Ecolo on the French side and Agalev on the Flemish  -
which did so well in the 1989 election, failed to improve on that election's
successes. Ecolo's share of the vote dropped to 13 per cent from 16.5 per
cent, their seats falling to only one from two. Agalev also lost ground,
although it maintained its one seat.
One explanation for their setback was their support for 'ecotaxes', very
unpopular in Belgium, although other commentators suggested that their
reputation had been knocked following their foray into national politics.

<TEXT>
The concern expressed that only national issues have been at stake in the
European elections may be well-meant, but it is hardly politically thought
out. The problem with the direct election to the European parliament is now,
as it always has been, that the voters don't know what they are voting for.
There is none of the normal confrontation between 'government or
opposition'. . . Voters who are only roughly informed about the
circumstances in other member states can hardly be expected to calculate the
consequences of their votes. The Germans send a good 15 per cent of European
members of parliament to Strasbourg; even if there were a massive level of
support for one party, it would have only a modest effect on building a
majority in the parliament - that is both unavoidable and logical. But it is
also clear that it depresses the election turnout.

Irish Republic

The Fianna Fail-Labour coalition in Ireland emerged from the European
Parliament elections with its representation at Strasbourg intact.
Fianna Fail, the centre-right party of prime minister Mr Albert Reynolds,
secured seven of the 15 Irish seats, one better than in 1989, while Labour
managed to retain its Dublin seat but only after a nail-biting series of
counts on the vote transfers which almost saw the seat lost to Fine Gael,
the main opposition party.
The nationwide drop in vote share for both coalition parties - but
particularly for Labour - has signalled that the 18-month honeymoon with the
electorate is over. Fianna Fail's vote has fallen from 39 per cent in the
1992 general elections to 35 per cent, while Labour's vote has plunged over
the same period to 11 per cent, albeit from an all-time high in 1992 of 19.5
per cent.
The emergence of the Green party, which won two seats, has highlighted the
government's inaction on key environmental issues. These include the recent
commissioning of the UK's Thorp nuclear reprocessing facility on the
opposite side of the Irish Sea, plans to push ahead with a peat-fired power
station in the Irish midlands, and procrastination over the building of a
new light rail system in Dublin to ease traffic congestion.
The Greens have a weak organisation nationally, however, and still have some
way to go before they pose a serious threat in national politics.
The collapse of Fianna Fail's vote in Dublin, from 33 per cent in 1992 to 21
per cent now, appears to stem in part from an unpopular residential property
tax introduced in the last budget. Canvassers said this was a common
complaint of householders during the campaign. It must raise questions over
the coalition's resolve to press ahead with its plans to reform the tax
system.
This and other tensions within the coalition are likely to be aggravated in
the months ahead, as Labour absorbs the lessons of this election and tries
to regain the popularity it achieved as an assertive opposition party before
entering the coalition.
The danger is that any fault-lines that appear within the coalition are
likely to be quickly exploited by Fine Gael, which has been buoyed by its
relative success in stabilising its vote at 24 per cent nationally, after
successive poll humiliations.
The other main opposition party, the Progressive Democrats (PDs), polled
only 6.5 per cent and last night lost its only seat in Munster to an
independent, Mr Pat Cox. In the local elections, Sinn Fein, the political
wing of the IRA, has won more council seats nationally than the PDs.

FT  14 JUN 94 / European Elections '94: Major mauled by Labour surge -
United Kingdom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major's government received a predictable mauling at the hands of an
angry and disillusioned electorate. Britain's opposition Labour party, still
choosing a new leader after the death last month of John Smith, did better
than in any election for 30 years. The outcome of the poll for the European
Parliament has left Britain's longer-term attitude to the European Union as
uncertain as ever.
Mainland Britain will send 62 Labour, 18 Conservative, two Liberal Democrat
and two Scottish Nationalists MEPs to Strasbourg next month. Northern
Ireland, the only part of UK to use a proportional voting system, will send
two, representing the mainly-protestant Unionist community and one from the
Catholic Social Democratic and Labour Party.
But it is the government - and the warring factions in the ruling
Conservative party - which will continue to dictate the country's attitude
to European integration in the run-up to the 1996 intergovernmental
conference. And the Euro-sceptic tone which characterised the Conservative
campaign seems to have won Mr Major votes.
As in many other countries in the EU, the story of the elections in Britain
was one of competing cross-currents and obvious contradictions. As the final
votes were counted, Labour and the Liberal Democrats claimed the electorate
had endorsed their, more positive, vision of Europe's future.
But only around 35 per cent of those eligible chose to vote. Also, the
opposition parties mounted campaigns against the government's domestic
policies - against tax increases, public spending cuts and such like -
rather than ones exalting the virtues of Europe.
Mr Major focused on Europe: the central planks of his campaign were a vision
of a multi-speed Union in which Britain might opt out of further
integration, preservation of the national veto and scepticism about a single
currency. The anecdotal evidence suggests that while the electorate was
determined to punish the government, it preferred its message on Europe.
So the immediate mood within the government was one of a curious sense of
relief. The Conservatives recorded their worst performance on record  - the
party has never before received less than 30 per cent of the vote in a
national poll - but it was not quite as catastrophic as feared.
Mr Major, who would have faced intense pressure to resign as prime minister
had that number dropped into single figures, now looks secure at least until
the autumn. He plans within a few weeks to reshape his government with a big
reshuffle of cabinet portfolios. The long summer parliamentary recess will
then offer him a respite from the constant carping about his leadership on
the Tory backbenches.
But the respite will be temporary. Labour, which won 45 per cent of the vote
against the Conservatives 28 per cent, made the electoral breakthrough in
affluent southern England which has so long eluded it. The next general
election is at least two years off but the government is now more threatened
than any time since the then Margaret Thatcher entered 10 Downing Street in
1979.
Mr Major's party is still deeply divided also over Europe, Even before all
the votes had been counted, the irreconciliable sceptics among Tory MPs at
Westminster were calling for a still more nationalist stance. They want the
prime minister to veto at the Corfu summit next week the appointment of Mr
Jean-Luc Dehaene as the next president of the European Commission. But their
demands were matched by equally strident calls from the mainstream
centre-left of the party for the government to abandon its appeasement of
the sceptics.

FT  14 JUN 94 / European Elections '94: Right avenges domestic defeat -
Spain

<TEXT>
Spain's political landscape has changed with the European election results.
After almost 12 years in power, Mr Felipe Gonzalez's Socialists have lost
their position as the country's leading party.
Hit by economic discontent, still rife despite signs that the country is
pulling out of recession, and by a series of acutely embarrassing corruption
affairs involving former senior officials, the party has slumped to barely
30 per cent of the vote, its level when it was in opposition 15 years ago.
Mr Gonzalez said he would consider putting his government to the test in a
confidence motion - which it would have to win or face a snap general
election.
The jubilant street party in Madrid on Sunday night for the conservatives of
the Popular party marked revenge after a frustrating failure in general
elections a year ago. It was the PP's first victory at national level.
Breaking through the 40 per cent mark, it also shattered a psychological
barrier - the stigma attached to the right in post-Franco Spain.
The PP gained from the demise of the centrists loyal to former prime
minister Mr Adolfo Suarez, who lost all five of their European parliament
seats.
The Socialists' record as the party that took Spain into the EU clearly
counted for little. Insofar as European issues had any influence, the PP
appears to have scored more through its criticism of the way Spanish
interests have been managed in Europe.
But even if it translated Sunday's results into a national election victory,
the PP would still, like the Socialists, need to look for support from
regionalist groups, with the prospect of a potentially unstable
relationship.
For Mr Jordi Pujol, the Catalan nationalist leader, his policy of providing
parliamentary support to keep the Socialists in power appears so far to have
paid off. Far from losing votes to the PP, his party headed the ballot in
Catalonia, the first time it has done so in a national election.
The Socialists took second place to the main regionalist parties in both
Catalonia and the Basque country, although in the second case by a narrow
margin over the PP.
Elsewhere they lost in every region except Extremadura and Andalucia -
including former strongholds such as Valencia, Murcia, Castile-La Mancha and
the mining area of Asturias.
In Andalucia, where regional elections were held at the same time, they lost
their majority in the regional parliament and now have little choice there
but to rely on support from the Communist-led United Left.
In both election contests, it was the United Left that scored
proportionately the biggest gains. Socialist hardliners who want to push
party policy back towards the left will see the loss of votes to the United
Left as reinforcing their arguments.

<TEXT>
European elections coincided with national legislative polls in the grand
Duchy of Luxembourg. Its 225,000 voters showed their faith in the ruling
coalition of Christian Socialist and Socialist parties which has been in
power since 1984, by returning them virtually intact.
Mr Jacques Santer, the prime minister and leader of the Christian
Socialists, lost one seat to take 21 of the total seats of 60. The
Socialists lost one seat to win 17.
Mr Santer is expected once again to choose the Socialists as partners in
government. The main opposition party - the liberal Democratic party -
gained one more seat to take a total of 12.
For the Strasbourg elections, Mr Santer's party lost one seat to hold only
two of Luxembourg's generous allocation of six. This seat passed for the
first time to the Greens, whose leader, Mr Jup Weber, burst into tears.
The win came as a genuine surprise to the Luxembourgois who had been
expecting the Greens to follow trends elsewhere in Europe and lose ground.
But Mr Weber appears to have benefited from concerns over the opening of an
industrial waste plant on the Belgian border and the extensive construction
of motorways across the country.

FT  14 JUN 94 / European Elections '94: Strasbourg set to tilt to the left -
A look at the new balance of power in the European Parliament after the
elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In spite of strong gains for the right across the Continent, the balance of
power in the European Parliament has changed little. If anything, in the
consolidation of power rather than in absolute number of seats, the
Strasbourg assembly will tilt slightly towards the left.
The hitherto dominant Socialist group will have in the new 567-member
legislature proportionally much the same presence as in the outgoing
518-strong assembly. This assumes that the Left Radical list in France
headed by Mr Bernard Tapie either sits or allies with the Socialists.
Centre-right and right-wing parties are numerically strengthened. But the
right will be a highly fragmented force, with fault-lines subject to
continual political stress, facing a much more cohesive Socialist bloc.
As a result, the broadly bipartisan motor put together by the Socialists and
Christian Democrats in the last parliament may be much harder to crank up.
That could stall the parliament in the way it uses its growing powers.
'Negotiations (between the two blocs) this time are going to be that much
more complex, because of this new situation on the centre-right,' predicts
Mr Julian Priestley, secretary-general of the Socialist group, tipped to
take over as secretary-general of the parliament.
Strasbourg was invested with significant new powers by the Maastricht
treaty, enabling it to negotiate for the first time as a near equal with the
Council of Ministers.
Since Maastricht came into force last November, Strasbourg has begun
demonstrating that for the first time it has a sense of priorities, and can
apply its weight effectively - for example, in winning pledges for a
top-table seat for the 1996 Maastricht review.
The new parliament will have to struggle to maintain that momentum, at a
time when the Council's cohesion will probably be strengthened. Germany,
France and Spain will successively hold the EU's six-month rotating
presidency up to 1996, and are co-ordinating efforts to run as seamless a
management as possible. The seams on parliament's centre-right, by contrast,
are highly visible.
The traditional Christian Democrats, mostly from the six founding member
states, have been strengthened by Chancellor Kohl's victory, but have shrunk
to a core group of around 130 MEPs. This section could grow in strength if
alliances with other groups, including Britain's Tories and Forza Italia,
are concluded.
But even if such coalescence took place, the federalist European People's
party (EPP) would then contain within it a powerful Euro-sceptical force.
The Christian Democrats share with the Socialists a commitment to Europe's
social and welfare policies. A strengthening of Euroscepticism would
contrast with the Christian Democrats' track record as assiduous drafters of
proto-constitutions for a federal Union.
As debate on the EU's jobless crisis sharpens and calls grow for labour
market deregulation, and as the 1996 review approaches, the EPP could find
it hard to stay together as a broad church.
The earliest set-pieces defining the new balance of power, however, will be
in the carve-up of the main parliament jobs.
The presidency, until now a role hovering ineffectually between figurehead
and parliamentary speaker, will assume greater importance.
The Socialists say they will almost certainly put forward a candidate. But
first they must sort out their own leadership, up to now the most
influential position at Strasbourg.
Mrs Pauline Green, leader of the UK Labour MEPs, now by far the largest
national grouping in the assembly, is clear front-runner, in competition
with the German SPD leader Klaus Hansch. If Mr Hansch does not win, he has a
plausible claim to his group's backing for the presidency, as does Mr
Jean-Pierre Cot, outgoing Socialist group chief.
One other presidential candidate, Ms Elisabeth Guigou, European affairs
minister in the last French Socialist government, is an outside runner
because of lack of MEP experience. Ms Guigou is also likely to suffer from
the poor showing of France's Socialist list.
The fragmentaton of the French vote would make it difficult for any group to
sustain a French candidacy for the top job. Hopes that French centrist
Dominique Baudis, the mayor of Toulouse, might get the presidency appear to
have evaporated since his UDF-RPR list lost ground.
Either of the two former Belgian Christian Democrat premiers elected,
current EPP leader Leo Tindemans and Mr Wilfried Martens, could stand.
However, many on both sides of the house feel parliament should look to the
future rather than the past.
Once the presidency is settled, an unseemly scrap could take place for
control of the four most important committees: foreign affairs (probably
absorbing trade); budgets; environment; and economic and monetary affairs.
The Socialists currently hold the first three and the Christian Democrats
the last.
The growing influence of the committees in shaping and shepherding
legislation had won them cross-party support irrespective of which group
chaired them. But this bipartisan attitude could now be eroded.
Mr Ken Collins, the Scottish Labour MEP who heads the environment committee
 -arguably Strasbourg's single most influential body - wants to keep it. He
could face challenge not only from the right but from Mr Carlo Ripa di
Meana, former EU environment commissioner elected for Italy's Greens, and,
according to insistent rumour, from Mrs Glenys Kinnock, wife of the former
UK Labour leader, and now newly elected in Wales.
Competition for the chair of the foreign affairs/trade committee will be
even fiercer if the two are amalgamated. Currently occupied by Mr Enrique
Baron - former president of the parliament tipped as new head of the WEU,
the Union's embryonic defence arm - the foreign affairs job conceivably
could go to Mr Fernando Moran, respected former Socialist foreign minister.
But the Spanish Socialists hold few cards after their hammering by both
right and left on Sunday.
Mr Piet Dankert, Dutch European Affairs minister and a distinguished former
parliament president, has his eye on the budgets committee. But this could
be a prime target for the EPP, which because of its fragmentation is having
difficulty settling on candidates.
One other important decision will be the parliament's choice of the MEP to
elaborate its case for the 1996 review conference. On merit and experience,
this job might go to Scottish Labour MEP David Martin, whose constitutional
work prior to the Maastricht summit was widely respected and influential.
In the new, more fissiparous configuration at Strasbourg, however, the
premium on consensus could give way to a more partisan struggle, for both
spoils and control.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ready itself to help shape new European Commission
MEPs have won the right to be consulted over the appointment of the new
Commission president. Parliament must also approve the make-up of the 1995
Commission before it can take office. MEPs are seeking to hold confirmation
hearings for proposed commissioners.
Intensify involvement in EU law-making
Already, 2,000 parliamentary amendments, mostly to Single Market law, have
been passed, and MEPs now have co-decision rights with the EU Council of
Ministers in many policy areas. These include services, education, culture,
health, multi-annual R&amp;D and environment programmes, consumer protection,
and workers' freedom of movement.
Co-decision means parliament can veto most measures passed by qualified
majority voting in the Council; a conciliation committee has been set up to
find compromises with the Council on contentious issues.
Increase the transparency of MEPs' links to business
With Parliament's growing power in important policy areas, the need
increases for greater disclosure of members' private involvement in commerce
and industry.
Press its case to achieve more legislative power
Parliament will step up its campaign during preparations for the 1996
Maastricht review, in which pressure will emerge, especially from Germany,
for an increase in MEPs' supervisory and legislative roles.
Prepare the campaign to win more budgetary control
Parliament is able to reject the EU budget and ask for it to be revised.
MEPs are seeking more involvement on the revenue side, where it currently
has no decision-making power.

FT  14 JUN 94 / European Elections '94: Industries' efforts to sway
Commission shift into gear - Lobbying has gained in priority

<TEXT>
Industry's contacts with the European Parliament are for the most part a
by-product of the well-oiled machinery that tries to exert an influence on
the European Commission.
Commissioners are likely to remain the first stop for any industry lobbyist.
But for some, the parliamentary elections have signalled that members of the
European Parliament may deserve more attention than can be given in the
spare time of a Brussels lobbyist.
The chemicals industry has one of the more powerful lobby organisations in
Brussels, Cefic, with a full-time European Parliament liaison officer. Some
countries, such as the UK since the 1989 Euro elections, have established
direct links with MEPs.
The two routes to Strasbourg are useful when differences arise between
national bodies and with Cefic. These are inevitable in the chemicals
industry because of the different make-up of national groups: the UK group,
for example, is an employers' association, whereas the German group is not.
The European textiles industry is an even more accomplished player of the
Euro-lobby game. It has a European Parliament lobbying group, set up nearly
four years ago by Mrs Carla Piejs, a Dutch Christian Democrat MEP. The
group, including representatives from the textiles trade and unions as well
as industry, has four meetings a year. These are open to specialist speakers
and journalists.
It can point to the establishment of an anti-fraud unit dealing with schemes
to avoid tariffs and trade quotas, and it successfully lobbied the
parliament to win greater assistance for exporters of textiles and clothing.
Then there is the electronics industry, which sees the European Parliament
as at best more bureaucratic entanglement, and at worst as an irrelevance.
Companies complain of a lack of initiative and focus compared with Brussels,
which is seen as the centre for policy making. MEPs are not particularly
visible nor easy to interest in industrial matters.
The European computing services industry provides an illustration. During
the past three years, the industry has been much concerned about a software
directive, ostensibly designed to curb software piracy, but with significant
implications for the freedom of software developers to build new products.
Few directives have seen fiercer lobbying by the opposing camps. The
lobbying took place in Brussels, however, not Strasbourg. The parliament was
not thought to have had much influence on or grasp of the principle at
stake.
UK retailers are also sceptical and deal with European institutions through
the national trade body, the British Retail Consortium (BRC). Brussels trade
groups and bodies such as the European Retail Alliance, set up by Ahold of
the Netherlands, France's Casino and Argyll of the UK, and EuroCommerce do
their share of lobbying, but the BRC usually prefers to deal directly with
MEPs, says Mr James May, its director general.
Mr May says UK retailers follow the line of the ruling UK Conservative party
in not wanting more powers to go to the European parliament. 'The role of
the parliament is to act as a watchdog on the commission,' he says .
The construction sector, too, tends to approach Brussels through national
industry bodies, and national interests have a strong role in what each
group presses for.
It has concentrated on lobbying the commission about the harmonisation of
standards for the design and construction of buildings. It may now take a
greater interest in the parliament and its committees, which can influence
the legislation under preparation. The planned regulation of environmental
emissions is one issue that is being watched by both construction and
chemicals industry groups.
The telecommunications business is by necessity more international in its
outlook than retailing and construction, where companies tend to be
nationally based.
British Telecom has had a Brussels office since 1990. It is now five-strong
and will soon be enlarged. Mr Peter Mackie, its director, says however that
'more than 80 per cent' of its time is devoted to the European Commission.
'We have not been very active with the parliament - just on an ad hoc basis.
About half of what we have done - briefings and so on - has been with
British MEPs, about half with others,' he said.
'We are looking to devote more time to the parliament now that co-decision
is more important, but most of the decisions affecting us will still be
taken in the Commission and the Council,' he adds.

FT  14 JUN 94 / European Elections '94: Bringing the lobbyists to book -
MEPs' business interests should be more transparent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the most important tasks facing the new European Parliament will be
to tighten the rules on members' business and lobbying interests.
The Strasbourg assembly is already heavily lobbied by companies and industry
associations trying to get European Union laws amended to protect their
interests.
Slightly more than half of parliament's amendments since the Single European
Act came into force in 1987 have passed into the national law of the 12
member states - a total of about 2,000 changes to what the Commission in
Brussels has proposed and the Council of Ministers has disposed.
But under the Maastricht treaty the parliament has significantly greater
powers to shape Euro-legislation - through 'co-decision' rights which enable
it to veto many directives passed by a majority in the Council of Ministers.
Since the virtual completion of the single market programme, the volume of
Euro-law has dropped, but the stakes for lobbyists have risen.
Yet the register of MEPs' interests shows that there are no effective
standardised systems for requiring members to declare their interests, and
that a significant minority of Euro-MPs are paid lobbyists for companies and
sectors with a direct interest in influencing Euro-law.
As one Euro-lobbyist puts it, 'I'd be quite careful about taking some of
them (MEPs) out with a client, because a lot of them are quite capable of
making a rival offer.'
As a group, and by a long way, the most active lobbyists and holders of paid
consultancies for industrial and commercial interests are British
Conservative MEPs.
The new assembly has an opportunity to clear the muddy waters because it is
at the start of a parliament that members are required to fill in a
declaration on their professional activities and other paid functions.
The record of what they declare is kept in 15 ring-bound volumes in an
obscure cubby-hole of the parliament's offices. The records travel between
Brussels and Strasbourg, where parliament holds its plenaries, and
occasionally Luxembourg. It can be consulted by the public under
supervision, but may not be photocopied - an unnecessary safeguard since
much of it is barely legible in the original.
What it reveals - using the verb loosely - is widely divergent political
cultures regarding what should be declared, and what paid activities may or
may not risk conflict of interest for an elected representative. A great
number of the entries are blank, declare no interest, or are registered only
in the mother-tongue of the MEP with no translation.
Among Continental Euro-MPs, it is common to state the former profession or
occupation. Very frequently, especially in France, Italy, and Germany, under
the heading other (usually paid) activities, will be listed another public
office, such as mayor, town or regional councillor, senator, party
functionary, or, for German Social Democrats from a trade union background,
continuing membership of works councils or supervisory boards of Germany's
leading companies.
Many MEPs broadcast, write for newspapers, and lecture at universities.
Indeed, a good deal of intellectual grandstanding goes into some entries,
particularly among some French and Spanish MEPs, who see the register as an
opportunity to outline seemingly illustrious curricula vitae: contributions
to this learned journal, professorship at that university, royalties from
these books, and so on. Many neo-fascist MEPs seem to think 'author' fully
describes their activity.
The register is full of little oddities, some piquant, some conceivably
attempts at humour. Mr Robert Hersant, for example, the French press baron
and absentee Giscardian MEP, lists himself professionally as a newspaper
publisher and TV station proprietor, but records zero income aside from his
Euro-MP's salary.
Mr Jose Maria-Ruiz Mateos, the entrepreneur who accounted for nearly 3 per
cent of Spanish national output until his failing Rumasa group was
expropriated in the early 1980s, is apparently a businessman without an
income.
Mr Jens-Peter Bonde, the Danish scourge of Maastricht who appears as an
accredited journalist at EU summits to bash Europe, describes himself as
'Editor (unpaid)'.
Two Italian Socialists, members of a party imploded by Italy's corruption
scandals, register their interests solely via a question mark.
British Labour MEPs ostentatiously list all their 'freebies', or study trips
paid for by governments and outside organisations, with more than a touch of
righteous pedantry.
The longest single entry is from Mr Bryan Cassidy, a Conservative MEP, and
indeed he and his 31 Tory colleagues in the last parliament provide most of
the register's meat. This could certainly be because of higher standards of
disclosure. But parliament officials, Tory officials, and lobbyists all
confirm that the Conservative MEPs are the most active in paid activity on
behalf of industry.
Only two former right-wing Spanish ministers - Eduardo Punset and Fernando
Suarez - and an eccentric Dutch Christian Democrat, James Janssen Van Raay,
who all sit on the boards of large companies such as Bull and Nestle, come
near to rivalling them.
Mr Cassidy has four consultancies, including Union Carbide and Rowland
Public Affairs. Mrs Caroline Jackson consults for Mars, the Brewers Society
and Market Access International, and sits on the board of Peugeot/Talbot UK.
She, and others of her colleagues, are on record as saying that proximity to
industry is valuable in weeding out parts of laws that could needlessly
damage business.
But a significant number of Tory MEPs own, or are partners in, their own PR,
lobbying, or public affairs consultancies, including Tom Spencer, Edward
McMillan-Scott, James Moorhouse, and Christopher Jackson.
However, it has generally been British MEPs, including the Tory Bill
Newton-Dunn, who have striven for tougher rules on disclosure. UK Labour
MEPs, who have become the largest national unit at Strasbourg, have, as a
group, not given the issue the priority that might have been expected.
From July, however, there is likely to be a groundswell in favour of full
disclosure, and the requirement on MEPs to declare an interest if they have
links to a company affected by the legislation they are dealing with,
particularly when it is at the crucial committee stage where most amending
gets done.
One leading lobbyist of the parliament says that 'I've only ever heard a
member declare an interest in committee twice' - not a record a parliament
with Strasbourg's new powers can any longer afford.

FT  14 JUN 94 / European Elections '94: Voters wary of grand designs -
Rebellious mood tempered by yearning for greater security / The European
Parliament has a chance to exert real influence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The new European parliament has made an inauspicious start. Low voter
turnout has again challenged the legitimacy of an institution which claims
to represent the European Union's best chance of increasing democratic
accountability.
Apathy was expected in the UK but the mood seems to have spread to the
Netherlands, Ireland and Portugal, traditional bastions of Euro-enthusiasm.
Where electors failed to show indifference, they demonstrated defiance. With
the exception of Germany, where Mr Helmut Kohl's victory shows how much
voters still lean toward Stabilitat uber alles, the politics of protest
scored heavily. The main - practically the only - left-wing victory came in
the UK, where the British government's insistence in keeping the majority
voting system for Euro elections has resulted in a disproportionate increase
in the Socialist group in Strasbourg.
Across Europe, the outcome was one of kaleidoscopic variety. In France, Mr
Bernard Tapie and Mr Philippe de Villiers, mavericks of the left and right,
emerged far stronger than expected. In Italy, Prime Minister Silvio
Berlusconi showed that his Forza Italia movement's general election victory
in March was more than simply an isolated surge of resentment with the
political establishment. In Spain, Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez joins Mr
John Major as one more incumbent leader in deep trouble.
The picture that emerged on Sunday night contains conflicting and
contradictory elements. The forces of fragmentation unleashed by the
collapse of communism in eastern Europe are still on the loose in the west.
Disillusionment with political elites remains palpable. But rebelliousness
is tempered by a yearning for greater security. Curiously, the EU looks a
safer and more attractive place from outside than from inside. Perhaps the
most significant result will turn out to be the overwhelming Austrian vote
on Sunday in favour of joining the European Union.
The big question is whether the EU, now attempting to bring in four new
members from the European Free Trade Association, can reconcile this
volatile public mood with the grand designs drawn up in the Maastricht
treaty.
Can Chancellor Helmut Kohl, whose chances of remaining in office in the
October general election have clearly grown, coax the German electorate into
accepting a fixed timetable for surrendering the D-Mark in economic and
monetary union (Emu)?
Can President Francois Mitterrand's successor in 1995 persuade his fellow
Frenchmen that the price of winning German support for Emu will be political
union - an arrangement which will necessarily constrain French sovereignty
in foreign and security policy?
Can a weakened Felipe Gonzalez encourage Spaniards to accept the labour
market flexibility and public spending discipline which remain crucial to
Spain's economic future?
Mr Hans Van den Broek, former Dutch foreign minister and now EU Commissioner
for external political affairs, said on Sunday night that it was very
difficult for the ordinary European citizen to recapture enthusiasm for the
European ideal in the absence of 'concrete achievements'.
He singled out EU's impotence in the face of the conflict in Bosnia, despite
its huge humanitarian aid effort. And he pointed to the EU's army of
unemployed, now past the 18m mark. A Commission official adds: 'Europe has
failed to answer the question: 'What's in it for me?' '
In search of an answer, the newly-elected parliament can play a constructive
role. Not a decisive role, because its powers are limited. It cannot
initiate legislation, for that is the sole prerogative of the Commission.
Nor does it enjoy direct revenue raising powers. But the new Maastricht
right of co-decision on Euro-legislation, which it shares with the Council
of Ministers, offer MEPs the opportunity to put the parliament on the map.
The chances of MEPs exerting real influence depend on a variety of factors,
starting with the composition of the parliament. At least 60 per cent of the
intake will be new members. With luck, many should be superior in quality to
their predecessors, a motley bunch of mavericks and freeloaders interspersed
with genuine talent (much of which was to be found among British MEPs,
widely praised by their peers in a pre-election survey conducted led by
Liberation, the French daily).
It is unclear, however, how the new groupings and parties will work with
each other in order to strengthen the parliament's influence on legislation
as well as its power alongside the Commission and the Council.
The parliament's institutional future will itself a crucial question at the
intergovernmental conference to review Maastricht in 1996.
The Socialist group is likely to be the parliament's single most cohesive
group. The centre right has gained strength, but the Christian
Democrat-dominated European People's Party remains fragmented, with the
allegiances of Mr Berlusconi's Forza Italia and the French Gaullists in
doubt.
The British Labour party is by far the strongest force in the Socialist
group.
Although the Socialists may be able to assert themselves in the parliament,
their influence will meet natural limits in the form of the continuing
predominance of centre-right governments in the Council of Ministers. The
lack of political harmony between parliament and Council raises another
large question. How far is the parliament ready to use its muscle to
challenge the Council not just on the fine points of Euro-legislation but
also on the wider question of democratic accountability in decision-making?
An early test of strength will turn on the choice of the next president of
the European Commission, a decision to be taken in secret by the 12 EU heads
of government, possibly at next week's European summit in Corfu.
Under the Maastricht treaty, the parliament is called upon to approve the
selection. To exert a veto would be tantamount to pressing a nuclear button.
But MEPs could use the opportunity of their high profile in public debate to
pass judgment on the wisdom of the choice, and could also put forward a list
of legislative priorities for the next Commission.
MEPs are considering holding quasi-Congressional hearings to question the
Commission president's team, sending a clear signal to member states that
the practice of sending political deadbeats to Brussels is no longer
acceptable.
The task for the new Euro-assembly will be to exercise and develop its
present powers without provoking the Council (and national parliaments) to
the extent of causing a backlash at the 1996 inter-governmental conference.
If they can succeed in this design, and somehow simultaneously win the trust
and engage the interest of the Euro-electorate, MEPs might be able to claim
that they have finally come of age.

FT  14 JUN 94 / European Elections '94: The deal makers hunt for allies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT and DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The election results may be counted but a new round of political jostling
has just begun.
With composition of the European Parliament split fairly evenly between
right and left, the task of building the parliament's political blocs is set
to be a delicate game of musical chairs.
The main forum for the manoeuvring will be the parliament's fragmented right
wing. While the left is presenting a fairly cohesive front, allied around
the dominant Socialist group, the right will face a difficult task in
forging any firm alliance.
The Christian Democrat group has traditionally been the key alliance maker
on the right. Its number overall has shrunk slightly in the election to
around 130 but the European Peoples Party (EPP) which it controls has a raft
of likely allies. This could raise the group's overall numbers to near
parity with the Socialists.
The question now is whether parties such as the UK Conservatives or Mr
Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia will be willing to work with the EPP.
'There will be hectic negotiations this week - there will be many telephone
calls across the borders,' said Mr Leo Tindemans, former Belgian prime
minister and leader of the EPP. He insists that the Christian Democrats do
not want to associate with Mr Berlusconi's main government allies, the
neo-fascist National Alliance/MSI and the Northern League.
Crucial negotiations will also centre around France's neo-Gaullist RPR and
the Portuguese ruling centre-right liberals. Portugal's liberals dislike the
whiff of incense still wafting around Christian Democracy. In France, the
transfer of a full Gaullist contingent, still attached to the General's
'l'Europe des Patries', is far from assured.
Although Britain's Tories sat in alliance with the EPP during the latter
part of the last parliament, many Christian Democrats are angry at the
anti-European tone of the Conservative government and its recent election
campaign.
Mr Tindemans himself says that some new alliance with the Conservatives
might still be possible - although he admits that Dutch, Italian and Belgian
Christian Democrats have been opposed in the past.
The Conservative party says it is keeping its options open until the
parliament reconvenes.
Although Chancellor Helmut Kohl, the main Christian Democrat broker and
deal-maker, appears well-disposed towards Mr Berlusconi, Benelux Christian
Democrats deplore the Italian leader's alliance with neo-fascists.
Even if the EPP does forge an alliance in the next few weeks, this may
sunder over the increased presence of Italy's neo-fascists at Strasbourg
when parliament assembles on July 19.

FT  14 JUN 94 / European Elections '94: Anti-Maastricht ghosts rise up to
wreak polls vengeance
</HEADLINE>

A picked scab never heals. This has been the theory on which Mr Philippe de
Villiers has been working ever since his anti-Maastricht cause lost the
French referendum by a whisker in September 1992.
And on Sunday he triumphed. His Other Europe list scored 12.3 per cent in
Sunday's French Euro-election to put himself and 12 other
anti-Maastrichters, including Sir James Goldsmith, into the Strasbourg
Parliament.
His success was not entirely unique. In Denmark two anti-European movements,
the June Movement and the People's Movement Against the EU, rose from 18.9
to 25.5 per cent of the vote - a result that is expected to leave Denmark
digging in its heels against further European integration. And in Belgium,
the Flemish extremist party Vlaams Blok, and the National Front in Wallonia
saw their support surge.
But it is France that the anti-Maastricht surge has been most vigorous and
most startling - not least because of the maverick persona of Mr Villiers
himself.
After the 1992 referendum, better-known leaders of the French
anti-Maastricht movement went on to hold office; Mr Charles Pasqua became
interior minister and Mr Philippe Seguin president of the National Assembly,
posts which inevitably led them to muzzle their residual opposition to the
controversial treaty.
But Mr de Villiers, a deputy nominally within the pro-European centre-right
UDF federation, never stopped picking away at the division over Europe that
the referendum revealed. He wrote a book called Our Europe with Maastricht.
He formed a supporters' club called 'Combat pour les Valeurs' whose main
credo is the fight against Brussels and sought alliances with like-minded
defenders of the nation-state in other European countries.
But special reasons contributed to his success at home. First, the Other
Europe provided an outlet for conservative French Euro-sceptics who saw none
of their views reflected in the joint pro-Maastricht list presented by the
UDF-RPR governing parties.
Second, while the only strong base of aristocratic Mr de Villiers - full
name: Philippe Le Jolis de Villiers de Saintignon - is in the rural,
royalist Vendee on the west coast, his list had others of national pulling
power. Number two on it was Sir James Goldsmith, whose book The Trap of Gatt
evidently endeared him to unreconciled opponents of the world trade accords.
The next pair on the list were Mr Charles de Gaulle, the late general's
grandson whose public diffidence was far outweighed by his name recognition,
and Mr Thierry Jean-Pierre, a former magistrate who won campaign headlines
by attacking corruption.
The third factor was that Sir James' presence on the list gave it virtually
unlimited finance. An Other Europe spokeswoman said yesterday the list had
received 'money from the public as well as that of (Sir James) Goldsmith',
whose Gulfstream jet she said had also been useful in the campaign. An
official of the National Committee for Campaign and Political Finance, which
oversees French election funding, explained yesterday that while outsider
contributors were limited to gifts of FFr500,000 (Pounds 58,500), a
candidate could contribute up to FFr85m (Pounds 1m) to his or her list.

The kidnappers of two Britons in Kashmir were offered a 'safe passage
corridor' by the Indian authorities yesterday to facilitate the quick
release of their captives.
Mr David Housego, father of a 16-year-old who is one of the captives, last
night issued a statement, intended to be heard by the captors, detailing
assurances given by the Indian authorities after meetings he had with them
in Srinagar.
'Both the British government and I have received assurances from the state
authorities that no operations will be carried out which will in any manner
endanger the release of Kim (Housego) and David Mackie,' Mr Housego said by
telephone from Srinagar. 'The assurances I have received also include giving
a safe passage corridor to Harkat-ul-Ansar (the militant group) to enable
the release of the two Britons within 24 hours or even sooner.'
The assurances appeared to meet the concerns of the captors, who had said
release was being hampered by the presence of Indian forces.
Mr Mohammed Farooq Kashmiri, Pakistan-based leader of Harkat-ul-Ansar,
yesterday urged Indian troops pursuing his fighters to pull back to create
an opportunity for the captives to be released.
He told the Financial Times in Muzaffarabad, capital of the
Pakistani-governed region of Kashmir, that he had given instructions that
the safety of the two 'guests' should be absolutely assured. But he was
concerned that Indian security forces which had cordoned the area in which
the militants were hiding had come very close.
'Nobody wants anything to happen to our guests because that would be a
discredit to our organisation,' said Mr Kashmiri.

FT  14 JUN 94 / N Korea quits atomic agency

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
North Korea yesterday announced it was withdrawing from the International
Atomic Energy Agency, but stopped short of taking the more serious step of
quitting the nuclear non-proliferation treaty.
Pyongyang said it would no longer permit IAEA inspectors into the country,
indicating that it would eject two agency inspectors who are now monitoring
the storage of spent fuel rods at the North's nuclear facilities at
Yongbyon.
The North Korean action was taken in response to a decision by the agency on
Friday to suspend technical aid to Pyongyang as a symbolic penalty for its
refusal to allow full international inspections.
'Any unreasonable inspection can never be allowed until it has been decided
whether we return to the non-proliferation treaty or completely withdraw
from it,' said a North Korean foreign ministry statement.
Mr Jimmy Carter, former US president, is expected to go to Pyongyang
tomorrow in an unofficial bid to keep dialogue open. North Korea may be
seeking US diplomatic recognition and economic aid in return for allowing
full inspections. But Mr Kim Deok, South Korea's intelligence chief, warned
yesterday that North Korea's 'ultimate goal is to develop nuclear weapons
and they are now employing delaying tactics to earn time'.
South Korea is to stage one of its largest civil defence exercises in recent
years to prepare the population for a possible conflict with the north. It
will conduct an emergency mobilisation exercise for the nation's 6.6m
reservists over the next two days to coincide with an air-raid drill
tomorrow covering the whole country. Air raid drills, which occur every
three months, are usually limited to the capital, Seoul.
North Korea's IAEA withdrawal is expected to add momentum to efforts by the
US, Japan and South Korea to get the UN Security Council to impose phased
sanctions against North Korea. China has so far opposed sanctions.
George Graham adds from Washington: Mr Robert Gallucci, who heads the US
policy steering group on Korea, said he had no official confirmation of
North Korea's withdrawal from the IAEA, but said that it would, if true, 'be
a very, very serious development for the worse.
'I certainly think it unfortunately adds another important bit of evidence
to the case that the North Koreans are not interested in a negotiated
settlement,' he said.

FT  14 JUN 94 / Acid rain pact to be signed in Oslo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Officials from more than 30 European and North American countries, meeting
in Oslo, are likely today to sign a far-reaching pact to curb acid rain.
Mr Thorbjoern Berntsen, Norway's environment minister, warned the agreement,
reached after a year of tortuous negotiation, 'will not solve the problems,
but it's a step in the right direction'.
The protocol, part of an international 'umbrella' convention covering air
pollution which crosses national boundaries, aims to curb sulphur emissions,
a main component of acid rain. Acid rain is thought to damage plants and
fish and eat away at buildings.
The deal has been controversial because sulphur is emitted mainly by
coal-fired power stations, and curbs require countries either to switch
energy sources or fit expensive filters to power station chimneys.
The new deal, worked out by the United Nations Economic Commission for
Europe, which covers most of Europe together with North America, has broken
with precedents by setting individual targets for each country based on how
much pollution wildlife and plants can withstand.
Britain, Poland and Spain, which contribute a large part of the 20m tonnes
of sulphur spewed into the European air each year, and which declined to
sign the earlier protocol, are expected to sign today.
US officials, who are attending the meeting, will not sign. They have argued
their environmental standards, while based on different criteria, are as
strict as the Oslo cuts.
Under today's agreement, Germany faces the biggest cut - of 87 per cent
compared to 1980 levels by 2005 - which it plans to achieve largely by
modernising noxious plants in eastern Germany. Britain will pledge to cut
sulphur emissions by 80 per cent on 1980 levels by 2010, mainly by switching
to gas from coal at power stations.
Greece will agree a 4 per cent emissions cut. Its soil contains high levels
of calcium, which neutralises sulphur, and so suffers less damage.
Environmental groups Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace and the World Wide
Fund for Nature, in a joint statement yesterday criticised the protocol as
'inadequate to stop acidification'.

FT  14 JUN 94 / Murdoch cut BBC to please China
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Rupert Murdoch, chairman of News Corporation, has finally admitted that
he kicked BBC World Service Television off his Star TV system in Asia to
please the Chinese government and help establish the satellite service
there.
In an interview with Mr William Shawcross, author of a Murdoch biography,
for Esquire magazine, Mr Murdoch conceded he had perhaps taken the action 'a
bit too easily because of my feelings for the BBC'.
Mr Murdoch also argued that it was pointless doing any broadcasting in Asia
except in local languages. But he accepted that those arguments did not meet
the main criticisms that had been made of him in an editorial in the
International Herald Tribune.
'There's no answer to it. They say it's a cowardly way, but we said in order
to get in there and get accepted, we'll cut the BBC out,' said the News
Corporation chairman.
The BBC agreed to go off the northern beam of the Star TV system which
covers Hong Kong, China, and Taiwan before its contract ran out at the end
of this year.

FT  14 JUN 94 / BIS wary of direct curbs on derivatives: A look at the
bank's reports as its annual meeting gets under way in Basle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Central banks should be wary of direct control of the growth of new
financial instruments such as derivatives, the Bank for International
Settlements argues in its 1993-94 report, published to coincide with its
annual meeting in Basle yesterday.
But Mr Andrew Crockett, BIS general manager, writing in the report's
conclusion, says: 'There is no inherent reason why the greater freedom to
transact in capital markets should, in general, make prices more volatile.
If anything, more depth and liquidity in markets, and a greater ability to
disaggregate exposures and hedge unwelcome risks should reinforce the
stabilising properties of markets.'
While the BIS does not want to see direct controls on these markets, it does
believe - as Mr Alan Greenspan, US Federal Reserve chairman, argued last
week - that they should be carefully monitored.
'Any official action should be directed at improving the ability of market
participants to exploit the advantages of new instruments without
jeopardising their own financial soundness or the stability of the financial
system more widely,' the report says.
Mr Crockett said yesterday: 'I don't think that administrative or
restrictive controls are the right way in which to reduce the potential
volatility that, it has been alleged, can be introduced by derivatives
markets.'
Mr Wim Duisenberg, BIS president, said financial markets must be
strengthened. 'Positions or trading strategies which may appear reasonable
from the perspective (of an individual firm) can be a source of difficulties
when aggregated across agents.'
In the case of derivatives, Mr Duisenberg said clearing house arrangements
which guard against risk for exchange traded instruments have proved
extremely difficult to extend to the over-the-counter markets. Furthermore,
Mr Duisenberg said, further work is needed to improve settlement systems,
particularly those relating to international transactions.
The Basle Committee on Banking Supervision, for which the BIS is the
secretariat, is working on a guidance paper for bank supervisors on the
control of the risks arising from derivatives activities. The committee is
also studying the models used by individual banks to monitor risk.
Mr Crockett warned banks should be careful when dealing with non-financial
groups. Referring to recent problems at companies such as
Metallgesellschaft, he said: 'Banks must be very careful in selling products
to unsophisticated large users. They must also take fully into account the
credit risk of dealing with non-bank users.'
The BIS also calls for further study into the way that the growth of
derivative instruments may have affected the response of the economy to
policy changes by the monetary authorities, such as movements in interest
rates. 'The extent to which such changes in behavioural response call for
adaptations in how central banks implement policy is unclear, but it is a
question that deserves, and is the subject of, further investigation as
these markets continue to grow.'
In essence, however, the BIS believes instability is more likely to arise
from failures in government and central bank policy, than from new financial
instruments.
'What capital market innovations demonstrate is the need for stable monetary
policies, implemented in a medium term framework,' says the report. 'If
market participants have confidence in the medium-term environment for
investment decisions, then these decisions are more likely to contribute to
stability and less likely to have disruptive consequences.'

FT  14 JUN 94 / Abu Nidal follower claims Lockerbie bombing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
A Palestinian follower of Abu Nidal, one of the world's most wanted
terrorists, claimed in a Lebanese court yesterday he himself had caused the
bombing in 1988 of the Pan Am flight which exploded over Lockerbie,
Scotland, killing 270 people.
Mr Youssef Shabaan, 29, made the claim during his trial on charges of
assassinating a Jordanian diplomat in Beirut earlier this year. Mr Shabaan
denies this charge, but told the court: 'I personally blew up the Lockerbie
plane.' He added: 'I've told the investigating magistrate about it before,
but my confession wasn't documented. I say it again now.'
The claim would appear to cloud further the already murky Lockerbie saga,
with which various countries and organisations have at one time or another
been associated. These include Libya, Iran, Syria and a Damascus-based
Palestinian group led by Mr Ahmed Djibril.
The focus of official US and British investigations into the bombing remains
fixed on Libya, where sanctions have been applied since 1992 for Tripoli's
refusal to hand over for trial in Scotland or the US, two security agents
blamed for bombing flight 103. Nevertheless, a British foreign office
spokesman said Mr Shabaan's apparent confession would be investigated.
Previous research has tended to distance Abu Nidal's group from the
Lockerbie bombing. In his 1992 book Abu Nidal: A Gun for Hire, author Mr
Patrick Seale says the 'world's most notorious Arab terrorist', whose real
name is Sabri el-Banna, had 'no connection' with the Lockerbie bombing. But
he nevertheless cites one of Abu Nidal's associates as quoting the guerrilla
leader saying: 'We do have some involvement in this matter, but if anyone so
much as mentions it, I will kill him with my own hands.'
However, Mr Seale records Abu Nidal's 'more outrageous lies' as including
improbable claims to have caused the Brighton bombing in 1984 and the fire
at Bradford City football ground in 1985 in which scores of fans died.
Abu Nidal's Fatah Revolutionary Council split from the Palestine Liberation
Organisation's mainstream Fatah wing in 1973 and is believed to have been
behind scores of terrorist acts in the 1970s and 1980s, including an
assassination attempt on Israel's ambassador to the UK in 1982 and the
slaughter of 16 people in a shooting at Rome airport in 1985. He is wanted
in at least 20 countries.
Abu Nidal's whereabouts are also a puzzle. He is believed to have left
Damascus for Tripoli in 1986, has been linked with Iraq, but the US state
department last year cited reports that his group had found sanctuary in
Sudan. Just five days ago Colonel Muammer Gadaffi, Libya's leader, claimed
he thought Abu Nidal had died. Quoted by the state news agency, Col Gadaffi
said: 'I believe he is not alive because I have appealed to him (to visit)
and he didn't come.'
Mr Samir Geagea, leader of the Lebanese Forces militia during the country's
17-year civil war, was yesterday charged with involvement in the February
bombing of a Beirut church in which 11 people were killed while at prayer.
Mr Geagea's deputy, Mr Fouad Malek, and six other members of the LF were
also indicted by a Lebanese prosecutor who has been investigating the
bombing. All the accused face a possible death penalty if convicted.
The indictment claims that one of the accused had direct contact with an
Israeli intelligence officer before the bombing.

Mr Yassir Arafat, Palestine Liberation Organisation chairman, has told
Israel in a letter the issue of Jerusalem should be off the agenda for now,
according to an Israeli newspaper yesterday, Reuter reports from Jerusalem.
The daily Haaretz said the PLO leader had sent three letters to Mr Yitzhak
Rabin, Israeli prime minister, reaffirming his commitment to peace and
proposing a lull in weeks of bickering over the status of the holy city.
Mr Rabin confirmed to Israel Radio he had received three Arafat letters but
refused to detail their contents, but said: 'They don't touch on anything
but the agreements and certain difficulties as described by Arafat among the
Palestinian population in the territories.'
In the letters, according to Haaretz, Mr Arafat proposed direct dialogue
with Mr Rabin and asked Israel not to hamper existing Palestinian
institutions in Arab East Jerusalem

FT  14 JUN 94 / France, South Africa and Egypt 'supplied Rwanda massacre
arms'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
France, South Africa and Egypt may have aided the slaughter of Tutsi
civilians in Rwanda by providing weapons and military training to the
Rwandan army and its militias, according to secret military documents
obtained by Human Rights Watch, a non-governmental organisation which
monitors the observance of human rights.
Human Rights Watch believes the massacres, which have claimed more than
200,000 lives in just over eight weeks, were systematically planned for
months in advance by extremists among the majority Hutu ethnic community.
Hardline elements of the Rwandan military, unhappy at the prospect of
sharing power with Tutsi rebels following the end of a three-year civil war,
armed and trained paramilitary militias as they sought to delay the
implementation of a peace agreement signed in August last year.
While firearms were distributed to Hutu militia known as Interahamwe ('Those
Who Attack Together'), a private radio station with close links to the
government broadcast hate-filled propaganda against the Tutsi community,
which make up 15 per cent of Rwanda's population.
When United Nations soldiers arrived to monitor the Rwandan peace agreement,
General Romeo Dallaire, the Canadian commander, says hand grenades could be
bought in market stalls for a dollar. Once the slaughter began, following
the death of President Juvenal Habyarimana in an air crash on April 6, hand
grenades were thrown into schools and churches that had given refuge to
Tutsi civilians.
Militia leaders urged their members to fan out across the country and finish
the nettoyage (cleaning up) of Tutsis and Hutu opponents of the Habyarimana
dictatorship. 'The death of President Habyarimana. . . was the pretext for
Hutu extremists from the late president's entourage to launch a campaign of
genocide against the Tutsi,' Human Rights Watch says.
'Militia and military continue to make nightly visits to stadiums, church
compounds and other locations were people at risk have taken refuge,' it
continues. 'They remove groups of people to be executed. Anyone who is
educated or has shown capacity for leadership is targeted for elimination.'
Two reports published by the human rights group are particularly
embarrassing for France, Rwanda's long-time military patron. Human Rights
Watch says France provided weapons, armoured cars and helicopters, as well
as military advisers and up to 680 troops to help the Rwandan government
fight the rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF).
In addition, Human Rights Watch obtained confidential documents concerning a
Dollars 6m (Pounds 4m) Egyptian arms sale to Rwanda which included landmines
and plastic explosives, automatic rifles, long-range artillery and rocket
launchers of the kind that are now pounding the capital Kigali. Under the
agreement, Rwanda was to obtain a bank guarantee from a 'first class
international bank' and pay the Dollars 6m into an Egyptian government
account held at a London branch of Credit Lyonnais, the state-owned French
bank.
Mr Olivier Perrain, a spokesman for Credit Lyonnais, yesterday confirmed the
existence of the account but said his institution had not provided the bank
guarantee. 'Credit Lyonnais took no part in the transaction,' Mr Perrain
said.
Another invoice obtained by Human Rights Watch shows that South Africa's
Armscor was also selling weapons to the Habyarimana government during
Rwanda's civil war. Mr Tielman de Waal, Armscor general manager, says the
sales stopped in October last year, when the war had officially ended.
Less can be proved about the RPF's military sourcing. The RPF claims to have
captured arms from the Rwandan government and bought others on the open
market. Less credibly, it claims to have stolen weapons from the Ugandan
army, to which many Rwandan exiles belonged.
Major Paul Kagame, the RPF's top military commander, was Ugandan President
Yoweri Museveni's chief intelligence officer before launching his own rebel
movement. And despite repeated denials, it is an open secret in Uganda that
Mr Museveni allowed the Rwandan rebels to use Ugandan territory as a
sanctuary for the planning of attacks, stockpiling of weapons and movement
of troops.

FT  14 JUN 94 / Recovery 'will fail to solve unemployment'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Even a sustained recovery in industrial economies will fail to solve the
problem of unemployment, the Bank for International Settlements warns in its
annual report, writes Philip Coggan.
The BIS takes the free-market line that 'a large proportion of the labour
force will remain unemployed unless action is taken to make labour markets
more flexible, especially in Europe'.
Mr Andrew Crockett, general manager of the BIS, said: 'The purpose of the
financial and economic system is to serve social goals: growth and
employment foremost among them.
'If the economic and financial system is not succeeding in delivering full
employment, we cannot be satisfied.
'The danger is that people will reach for the most obvious solution: to
expand aggregate demand.'
In the annual report, the BIS argues high unemployment is due to 'structural
rigidities that prevent the labour market from functioning efficiently.
'Legal or other arrangements, originally designed to protect workers in
employment, have turned against those without jobs.'
The bank is not very optimistic that the problem can be easily solved.
'Unfortunately for the prospects of achieving reform, existing arrangements
are often backed by a strong social consensus,' the report adds.
'There seems to be little alternative to a patient explanation of economic
cause and effect as a means of preparing public attitudes for the changes
essential if lasting progress is to be made in tackling the evil of
unemployment.'
More immediately, the Bank argues that progress could be made by scaling
back employers' social security contributions and other non-wage costs which
may constitute a disincentive to take on labour.
Although the bank feels that the current unemployment rate of 11.5 per cent
in European countries is partly cyclical, it warns that 'even on the most
favourable estimates, some 7-8 per cent of hard-core or structural
unemployment would remain after a cyclical recovery'.

FT  14 JUN 94 / Murdoch cut BBC to please China
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Rupert Murdoch, chairman of News Corporation, has finally admitted that
he kicked BBC World Service Television off his Star TV system in Asia to
please the Chinese government and help estab-lish the satellite service
there.
In an interview with Mr William Shawcross, author of a Murdoch biography,
for Esquire magazine, Mr Murdoch conceded he had perhaps taken the action 'a
bit too easily because of my feelings for the BBC'.
Mr Murdoch also argued that it was pointless doing any broadcasting in Asia
except in local languages. But he accepted that those arguments did not meet
the main criticisms that had been made of him in an editorial in the
International Herald Tribune.
'There's no answer to it. They say it's a cowardly way, but we said in order
to get in there and get accepted, we'll cut the BBC out,' said the News
Corporation chairman.
'I was well aware that the freedom fighters of the world would abuse me for
it. I think my credentials are good enough to be able to see me through that
one. But I don't want to do it through the medium of the BBC,' Mr Murdoch
added.
The BBC agreed to go off the northern beam of the Star TV system which
covers Hong Kong, China, and Taiwan before its contract ran out at the end
of this year. In return News Corp was able to negotiate an extension into
1996 to keep its service on the southern beam covering the Indian
sub-continent.
In a speech in London last September Mr Murdoch spoke of how advances in
technology 'have proved an unambiguous threat to totalitarian regimes
everywhere'.
It was an argument that clearly impressed the Chinese government.

FT  14 JUN 94 / Tokyo shares at two-year high: Improving business confidence
lifts Nikkei index to 21,552
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Tokyo stock market hit a new two-year high yesterday as investors were
encouraged by positive economic data and positive comments over an early
recovery by leading financial officials.
The Nikkei index of 225 leading shares rose 157.63 to 21,552.81, the highest
since February 1992. Heightened optimism towards the economy helped the
index break a psychologically important 21,000 level last week, improving
confidence among both institutional and retail investors.
Yesterday's rise follows the release of the Bank of Japan's quarterly
business survey last Friday which indicated an improvement in sentiment
among managers for the first time in five years.
Mr Yasushi Mieno, governor of the central bank, yesterday said before a
parliamentary committee that there seemed to be a high possibility the
economy had moved a step toward recovery.
While cautioning that currency movements and stock adjustment among
manufacturers still needed monitoring, Mr Mieno said interest rates were
sufficiently low for companies to start capital investment. He also expects
income tax cuts worth Y5,500bn (Pounds 35bn) to help recovery. Similar views
were aired by Mr Jiro Saito, vice finance minister, although he refused to
'declare with confidence that the economy will head toward recovery'.
Such economic optimism hurt Tokyo bond prices yesterday, as investors
switched funds from bonds to stocks. And although the two-week rally has
started to make some investors anticipate a correction, most are expecting
the downside to be limited. 'We haven't had big jumps in the market and
volumes have been encouraging,' says Mr Jason James, strategist at
stockbroker James Capel.
Since many banks and industrial companies still hold large amounts of shares
in their investment portfolios, the rise in share prices is in turn expected
to have a positive effect on business sentiment.

FT  14 JUN 94 / Mexico buys into Cuban telecoms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TED BARDACKE and AP
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY, HAVANA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Carlos Salinas of Mexico announced yesterday, during a visit to
Havana, that a Mexican company has bought 49 per cent of Emtelcuba, the
Cuban telephone monopoly.
An official of Grupo Domos International said the company had a Dollars
1.4bn (Pounds 927m) agreement. It is to pay Dollars 740m for its share of
the telephone company and invest a further Dollars 740m over seven years to
improve the island's telephone system.
The president was accompanied on his six-hour visit to Cuba by Mr Javier
Garza Calderon, head of Grupo Domos and a member of the Garza family of
Monterrey, Mexico, which has interests in such industrial giants as Visa,
Femsa and Bancomer.
Mr Garza Calderon was an unsuccessful bidder for Telmex when the Mexican
government privatised its telephone monopoly in 1990.
The Cuban telephone system is antiquated. Fewer than five in every 100
people in Cuba have telephone lines and as many as half of those lines are
not functioning at any time.
However, Domos is betting that negotiations between Cuban and US officials
will open a lucrative long-distance calls market between the two countries
beyond the current limit of 300 calls per day.
Even with the limit, those and other international calls generate
hard-currency income of an estimated Dollars 2m per month for Emtelcuba.
The Mexican government will begin to implement unilaterally the local
economic programmes proposed in its peace offer to the Zapatista rebels in
Chiapas, despite their overwhelming rejection of the plan at the weekend.
Efforts to try to implement the programmes, aimed at helping the indigenous
people in the impoverished southern state, will be made in areas not under
rebel control.
The move is seen as an attempt to show the Zapatistas that the government is
serious about its offers, and to isolate the rebels from potential
supporters in surrounding areas. The rebels are in a weak position
militarily, virtually surrounded by the Mexican army.

FT  14 JUN 94 / GM wins truck crash verdict
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
General Motors yesterday won a big legal victory when the appeal court in
the southern US state of Georgia threw out a jury verdict which had ordered
the company to pay Dollars 105m (Pounds 70m) in damages to the parents of a
teenager who was killed when his GM truck exploded in a crash.
The court decision helps considerably in GM's fight to avoid the recall of
more than 4m vehicles similar to the truck which was being driven by
17-year-old Shannon Moseley.
The decision will also help to head off dozens of other liability suits.
Although the appeal court denied GM's claim that the jury award of Dollars
4.25m for the boy's life and another Dollars 101m of punitive damages was
excessive, it ruled that lawyers for the plaintiffs had deliberately and
repeatedly referred to 120 other suits involving GM trucks, without
presenting evidence to link them to the Moseley case.
GM had argued in the original trial that Mr Moseley died instantly when his
truck was hit in the side at high speed.
However, the plaintiffs maintained that the truck design, by which petrol
tanks were mounted 'side-saddle', outside the vehicle frame, was inherently
unsafe.
GM produced about 6m of the C/K full-sized pick-up truck with side-mounted
petrol tanks in 1973-1987.
In 1988, it moved the tanks inside the frame, but said that this was for
design rather than safety reasons.
Last year, GM won an apology from NBC, when it proved that the television
network had rigged a film purporting to show that the trucks in question
caught fire on impact.
The federal government last year asked GM to recall the trucks, but that
decision is now being reconsidered.
The transportation department is concerned that it would be setting a
precedent by ordering the recall of a vehicle that had met relevant safety
standards.
Many of the trucks in question were sold more than eight years ago and so GM
could not legally be forced to pay for their recall.

</HEADLINE>

   By JEREMY KAHN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US Justice Department yesterday proposed legislation to strengthen its
ability to crack international price-fixing rings.
The proposed International Anti-trust Enforcement Act would let the
department obtain evidence under reciprocal agreements with foreign
anti-trust agencies. The bill, which has bi-partisan Congressional support,
is modelled on a law allowing international collaboration by the US
Securities and Exchange Commission.
'The need for evidence located abroad is almost always the rule, not the
exception,' Ms Janet Reno, the attorney-general, said. She cited the
announcement last week that a joint US-Canadian effort had broken up a
multi-million dollar conspiracy to rig plastic dinnerware prices.
Canada is the only country with which US trust-busters have an agreement to
share evidence, but it is restricted to criminal cases, Ms Reno said.
Agreements under the proposed bill could be used in criminal and civil
anti-trust prosecutions.
The US administration is trying to increase its anti-trust activities. Ms
Anne Bingaman, assistant attorney-general for anti-trust, said she knew of
at least 10 international investigations pending. She said that the justice
department would be announcing the break-up of another big cartel within the
month.
The new law would let the US call on foreign administrations to track down
witnesses and issue subpoenas, and to hand over documents.
Foreign anti-trust agencies could make similar requests of the US. However,
Ms Bingaman cautioned, her division would assist only when that would be in
the US interest and when the foreign agencies could provide the level of
confidentiality provided under US law.

Exxon was found guilty yesterday of recklessness over the worst US oil
spill, at Prince William Sound, Alaska in 1989. The decision, in a federal
court in Anchorage, Alaska, exposed it to punitive damages of up to Dollars
15bn (Pounds 10bn).
The jury also found against Mr Joseph Hazelwood, the captain of the tanker
Exxon Valdez, which ran aground shortly after leaving the port of Valdez.
The verdict yesterday wiped 4 per cent off Exxon's share price, cutting the
market value of the biggest US company by more than Dollars 3bn. Its shares
closed at Dollars 59 5/8 , down Dollars 2 5/8 on the day.
During the trial, which began six weeks ago, it was claimed Mr Hazelwood was
drunk on the evening of the disaster and that Exxon had known for a long
time of his drinking problem. Mr Hazelwood testified he had been treated for
alcohol abuse in 1985, and Exxon, while aware of this, had allowed him to
return to sea without monitoring. At the time of the accident, he had gone
below deck, leaving a third mate in command on the bridge. He denied being
drunk, but admitted he had been drinking shortly before the ship left
Valdez.
The recklessness verdict opens the way for a further phase of the trial this
summer. The same jury will consider the scale of punitive damages to be paid
by the company. Lawyers for the plaintiffs, who include 10,000 fishermen and
local land-owners, have asked punitive damages to be set at Dollars 15bn,
ten times the scale of the damages they are claiming.
Exxon said it would argue in court it should not be forced to pay punitive
damages. Mr Lee Raymond, Exxon chairman, said the company believed 'the
evidence presented in the next phases of the trial, showing what Exxon has
already spent and done, will convincingly demonstrate that no award of
punitive damages should be made.'
At an earlier stage in the legal proceedings, the trial judge rejected an
application by Exxon it should not have to disclose its financial wealth to
the jury before they decided on the scale of any damages. Hearings to assess
these are expected in about a month. Before then, the jury will consider
claims for actual damages against the company.
The Valdez disaster has already cost Exxon about Dollars 3.5bn. It paid
Dollars 1.1bn to settle federal and state charges, more than Dollars 2bn to
cleanse the contaminated coastline and Dollars 300m to settle civil claims
voluntarily.

FT  14 JUN 94 / Clinton to launch plan to reform US welfare system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton will today present his plan to 'end welfare as we
know it,' an ambitious blueprint for overhauling the US benefit system in a
way intended to encourage and force people to move off the dole and back
into the workforce.
The plan, which has been under consideration since Mr Clinton took office a
year and a half ago, is built around a two-year limit on payments under aid
to families with dependent children, the main US welfare programme, which
supports about 5m families.
Mr Clinton is due to outline the plan in a speech at Kansas City, Missouri.
After the two years of AFDC cash payments are exhausted, most recipients
unable to find a job would be required to enrol in a one-year government
work programme.
Unlike some proposals circulating in Congress, the Clinton plan would allow
people to re-enrol repeatedly in these programmes, so long as they continued
to look for work and did not turn down a job offer. A Republican plan would
permit states to cut off people still jobless after three years in a
government work programme.
Virginian voters in a Democratic party primary election will choose today a
candidate to face the Republican nominee Mr Oliver North for a Senate seat.
Incumbent Senator Chuck Robb is expected to sweep the primary, but the real
race will be elsewhere as independent candidates battle to gather enough
nominating signatures to get their names on the ballot for November.
By the time the polls close at 7 pm Mr Douglas Wilder, Democratic former
governor of Virginia, and Mr Marshall Coleman, Republican former state
attorney-general, must present documents with about 15,000 signatures,
including at least 200 from each Congressional district in the state.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Two US ships on which Haitians will be questioned about their requests for
asylum in the US were anchored just outside the harbour of the Jamaican
capital at the weekend.
But there is still no indication when the operation will begin.
US officials say that Haitians fleeing their country for the US will still
be returned home.
The USS Comfort, a thousand-bed hospital ship, and the Gruziya, a chartered
Ukrainian cruise ship, will be the first processing centres off Jamaica,
under the new US policy to give Haitians seeking asylum a hearing to
determine the validity of their claims.
There is no definite date for starting the migrant processing centre, said
Brig-Gen Michael Williams who is heading the operation. 'Until such time
that all arrangements have been completed, the US will continue to
repatriate all Haitians interdicted at sea and encourage Haitians to go to
one of three processing centres already in Haiti as the safest way to
process their claim to refugee status,' he added.
When the operation begins, Haitians intercepted at sea will be taken to the
Comfort, two miles outside the entrance of Kingston harbour, where they will
be medically tested and photographed.
After questioning, Haitians not accepted as refugees will be returned to
Haiti. Those 'determined to have a legitimate status as refugees' will be
sent to Kingston airport, flown to the US naval base at Guantanamo in Cuba,
and then taken to the US, Brig-Gen Williams said.
The use of the ships to process Haitians' claims followed criticism of the
US policy of returning all Haitians intercepted at sea. The volume of
Haitian boatpeople heading for Florida has grown since the overthrow and
exile of Mr Jean-Bertrand Aristide, Haiti's elected president, in 1991.

Senate race

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Virginian voters in a Democratic party primary election will choose today a
candidate to face the Republican nominee Mr Oliver North for a seat in the
US Senate.
Incumbent Senator Chuck Robb is generally expected to sweep the primary, but
the real race will be elsewhere as independent candidates battle to gather
enough nominating signatures to get their names on the ballot for November.
By the time the polls close at 7 pm (11 pm GMT), Mr Douglas Wilder,
Democratic former governor of Virginia, and Mr Marshall Coleman, Republican
former state attorney-general, must present documents with about 15,000
signatures, including at least 200 from each Congressional district in the
state.
Their independent candidacies are expected to be crucial in an election
where neither of the main party candidates has wide support. Mr Robb, once a
rising star of the Democratic party, has been tarnished in the eyes of many
voters by his sexual peccadilloes. His acknowledgment of a naked massage,
but nothing more, by a beauty queen has entered the comic lexicon of US
politics with President Bill Clinton's insistance that, yes, he had smoked
marijuana but did not inhale.
Many ardent Republicans are expected to vote for him today in the primary,
in the belief that he is the candidate Mr North can most easily defeat.
Mr Robb could lose many votes, especially among the mostly Democratic black
Virginians, to Mr Wilder, the first African-American elected a state
governor since the Reconstruction period immediately after the Civil War.
Mr North was a central figure in the Iran-contra scheme to send arms to Iran
in exchange for the release of US hostages held in Lebanon. That damaged
President Ronald Reagan's later years in office. Mr North commands fervent
adoration from the mostly right-wing and religious Republicans who nominated
him, but deep distrust from almost everyone else, including many centrist
Republicans.

FT  14 JUN 94 / Mexico peace plan starts in south
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TED BARDACKE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Mexican government will begin unilaterally to implement the local
economic programmes proposed in its peace offer to the Zapatista rebels in
Chiapas, despite their overwhelming rejection of the plan at the weekend.
Efforts to try to implement the programmes, aimed at improving the lot of
the indigenous people in the impoverished southern state, will be made in
areas not under rebel control.
The move is seen as an attempt to show the Zapatistas that the government is
serious about making good on its offers, as well as to isolate the rebels
from potential supporters in surrounding areas.
The rebels are already in a very weak position militarily, virtually
surrounded by the Mexican army which has been ordered to reinforce its
patrols in the area.
In rejecting the government's peace offer and seeking a new round of talks,
the Zapatistas said their main concern was that their national demands for a
democratic transition in the country had not been met. Since the beginning
of negotiations, the government has said such issues would be taken up not
with armed insurgents but with the country's political parties.
A recent overhaul of the nation's electoral system, spurred by events in
Chiapas but negotiated by the government and political parties in Mexico
City, seems not to have satisfied the Zapatistas.
The problem of the rebels is thus unlikely to be resolved before the
national elections in August, as the two sides appear to disagree on the
basic issue of how much say the insurgents should have over issues of
national scope, principally democracy.
'We still do not have definitive accords, but the ceasefire has been
consolidated and the commitment to search for a political decision in favour
of peace is maintained,' said Mr Manuel Camacho Sols, the government's peace
negotiator.
However, the government has failed in one of its main objectives - to disarm
the rebels before the elections - and it will be up to the next president to
grapple with the problem.

FT  14 JUN 94 / Cuba close to telecoms sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TED BARDACKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Grupo Domos, a Mexico-based holding company, is close to finalising a deal
to buy 49 per cent of Emtelcuba, Cuba's telephone monopoly, for about
Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 1bn).
This would be Cuba's first important privatisation since the 1959 revolution
and would be in the context of rapidly growing business between Mexico and
Cuba.
The deal is likely to include a concession to operate the telephone system
in Cuba and an ambitious modernisation plan.
The length of the concession and its price are still being negotiated.
Company officials said the deal was being discussed yesterday during a
one-day visit to Havana by President Carlos Salinas de Gortari of Mexico.
He is being accompanied on his trip by Mr Javier Garza Calderon, leader of
Grupo Domos and a member of the wealthy Garza family of Monterrey in Mexico,
which has interests in such industrial giants as Visa, Femsa and Bancomer.
Mr Garza Calderon was a bidder for Telmex when the Mexican government
privatised its telephone monopoly in 1990.
He did not win on that occasion but has maintained his group's interest in
telecommunications, until recently operating cellular-phone services in
northern Mexico.
The Cuban telephone system that Domos would purchase is even more antiquated
that the Mexican network it once tried to buy. Fewer than five in every 100
people in Cuba have telephone lines and as many as half of those lines are
not functioning at any one time.
However, Domos is betting that negotiations between Cuban and US officials
will open a lucrative long-distance calls market between the two countries
beyond the current limit of 300 calls per day.
Even with the limit, those and other international calls generate
hard-currency income of an estimated Dollars 2m per month for Cuban
Telecommunications.
Other Mexican companies are operating in Cuba, in tourism, textiles, cement,
cellular-phones and oil exploration, among other areas.

FT  14 JUN 94 / Exports limp behind while the rest of Peru strides out:
After almost four years of sweeping economic reform, one vital sector
stubbornly stands out in its failure to respond
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SALLY BOWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The export sector continues to be the Cinderella of Peru's buoyant economy.
In the almost four years since the administration of President Alberto
Fujimori embarked on its sweeping programme of deregulation and structural
adjustment, exports have stubbornly failed to respond.
Exports were, in fact, stagnant throughout the 1980s, never coming close to
matching the record Dollars 3.9bn in 1980. What has changed is their
make-up: 'non-traditional' exports (mainly finished and agro-industrial
products) have gradually gained in importance while traditional exports
(minerals, oil, sugar, cotton and fishmeal) have fallen to 67 per cent of
last year's estimated total value of Dollars 3.4bn.
The sluggish performance reflects in part Peru's vulnerability to
international raw materials prices. And while the economy enjoyed the
protection of high tariffs - until early 1991 - the balance of trade
remained favourable.
But three years of fast-growing, mainly consumer-driven imports have sunk
Peru's trade account into deficit and the gap this year will be wider than
ever. Even Mr German Suarez, president of Peru's central bank, has admitted
the deficit will almost certainly be well above the Dollars 569m enshrined
in the 1994 'letter of intent' currently pending approval by the
International Monetary Fund.
This year's economic programme, to an even greater extent than hitherto,
stresses control of inflation - it should not exceed 20 per cent this year,
down from 39.5 per cent in 1993. The exchange rate, meanwhile, will continue
to float but money supply targets will remain tight. The central bank will
not sacrifice these targets in order to intervene on the foreign exchange
markets.
All of which is bad news for Peru's already hard-pressed exporters. In the
past 12 months, the Peruvian sol has appreciated by almost 14 per cent
against the dollar - half of that in the first five months of this year.
Mr Francisco Raffo's modern Textil San Cristobal factory in Chincha is just
the sort of operation that Peru should be encouraging. Built at a cost of
Dollars 10m four years ago, it produces top-quality cotton knits for some of
the world's most demanding customers, including Adidas, Nike and Reebok.
Sales last year - about 90 per cent exported - topped Dollars 24m.
San Cristobal trades on Peru's natural advantages - world class raw
materials in its Pima and Tanguis cotton and an inexpensive but skilled
labour force. Machinery is the most modern available and efficiency is high.
'But even having cut costs to the bone, we barely turn a profit,' says Mr
Raffo.
Although exporters publicly demand government intervention to 'improve' the
exchange rate, most of them privately admit this is unlikely under the free
market economic policies to which the Fujimori government is committed.
Action, however, could be taken on a number of other fronts to reduce excess
charges and 'anti-technical' taxes, they say.
First, they want a full tax 'drawback' scheme on the grounds that 'taxes
should not be exported'. Currently, exporters can reclaim locally-applied
value added tax, though the system is unwieldy and refunds slow to come
through.
Exporters, however, enjoy no 'drawback' on the high internal tax levied on
fuel products. The economy and finance ministry claims the scheme is too
complex to administer. Mr Raffo reckons his energy costs, at Dollars 100,000
a month, are three times those of Latin American competitors.
Peruvian businesses are also hammered by a series of supposedly 'emergency'
tax measures, in force until fiscal reforms and a broadening of the taxpayer
base is achieved. One is a minimum 2 per cent tax on assets, paid monthly
and offset as an income tax credit if the business turns in a profit.
Lossmakers forfeit the tax entirely.
Businesses must now also bear the entire brunt of the housing fund
contribution Fonavi, in effect a 9 per cent payroll tax. And, despite the
decline in terrorist attacks, security costs remain a heavy burden on
Peruvian businesses.
The government argues that exporters have benefited substantially from a
series of structural reforms, including the slashing of import duties, port
handling and transport costs.
While admitting that customs efficiency has improved, exporters complain
that procedures remain cumbersomely bureaucratic.
'We're now competing in a global marketplace with countries like Taiwan and
Korea, and we simply can't afford these delays,' says Mr Raffo.
The yawning trade deficit this year may, however, force more decisive moves
to deepen the partly completed foreign trade reforms.
'If the gap between imports and exports approaches Dollars 1bn this year,
which is perfectly likely, then the government will have to take steps to
improve conditions for exporters,' predicts Mr Raffo.

FT  14 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Renault plans to make cars in Vietnam
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Renault, the French state-owned carmaker, has signed a letter of intent to
begin car assembly in Vietnam.
The cars will be produced by Vietnam Motors (VMC) with kits supplied by
Renault from France. Vietnam Motors is a joint venture between Columbian
Motors of the Philippines, which holds a 55 per cent stake, Nichimen of
Japan with a 15 per cent stake and a Vietnamese state company.
The group plans to produce the Renault 19 small family car with assembly of
Renault's CKD (completely knocked down) kits likely to begin in early 1995.
It already assembles the Mazda 626 and 323 from kits along with some
products from Kia, the South Korean carmaker. It also plans to start
assembly of the BMW 525 at its plant near Hanoi in September.
As an emerging market Vietnam is being viewed with great interest by several
of the world's leading vehicle makers.
Last month Mitsubishi Motors became the first Japanese carmaker to enter a
joint venture in Vietnam.
It has received approval by the Vietnamese government to form a joint
vehicle manufacturing and sales venture in Vietnam along with Proton, the
Malaysian carmaker in which it holds a minority stake and Vietranscimex, a
Vietnamese national company.
They are forming a joint venture, Vina Star Motors, in which Mitsubishi
Motors, Mitsubishi Corporation and Proton will each hold stakes of 25 per
cent, to assemble the Mitsubishi Delica minibus. Production is scheduled to
start next March.
Mekong, a Japanese-South Korean joint venture with Vietnamese companies,
assembles four-wheel-drive vehicles at a plant in Ho Chi Minh City and has a
plant near Hanoi that produces light buses and trucks in co-operation with
Iveco, the commercial vehicle subsidiary of Fiat of Italy.
Reuter, the news agency, reported yesterday that a senior official of
Vietnam Motors in Hanoi had confirmed that the Vietnamese government had
decided to raise taxes on imported cars to 200 per cent from the present
level of 150 per cent from July 1. Most imported cars come from Japan.
'We hope it will be very good news for us because imported cars will be very
expensive,' said Mr Joaquin Roa, VMC general manager.
The impact of the higher tax would depend, however, on effective policing of
the borders to prevent smuggling, which increased when governments raised
car import taxes.

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Court of International Trade has rejected a Department of Commerce
ruling that imposed countervailing duties on privatised companies because
subsidies had been granted to their government-owned predecessors.
The CIT rejected the department's conclusion that subsidies, although they
may have been granted years before, 'travel with productive units to their
new home' in the private sector. Mr Sheldon Hochberg, lawyer for the UK's
United Engineering Steels, said the case would be 'a harbinger' for larger
steel import cases to come to the court on appeal.
United Engineering Steels was a private sector joint venture between British
Steel Corporation and the UK's Guest, Keen &amp; Nettlefolds (GKN). BSC
contributed its specials steel business to the new company and GKN
contributed Bymbo Steel works.
The UK government provided subsidies to BSC from 1978 to 1986, when the
joint venture was launched.
'The Court concludes UES did not indirectly receive the benefit of BSC's
earlier subsidies,' said the judge.

FT  14 JUN 94 / World Trade News: BAe to discuss rocket system with Pinochet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Aerospace said yesterday it planned to have talks this week in the
UK with Gen Augusto Pinochet, Chilean armed forces chief and former
president, on the development of an artillery rocket weapons system.
A Bae official said last night: 'We are aware that General Pinochet is in
the UK, and it is assumed that he will be in conversations with us. There is
considerable Chilean interest in this system which is potentially worth
millions of pounds to us.'
The potential research and development contract involves a 'flexible' rocket
system which can be produced for use either by wheeled or tracked vehicles.
The system would be jointly developed with the Chilean defence industry by
the rockets division of BAe's subsidiary, Royal Ordnance. It is understood
the Chilean army is interested in producing the system locally.
Britain has good diplomatic relations with Chile, and has largely ignored
protests over Gen Pinochet's human rights record following the strong
support offered by the Chilean armed forces to the UK during the Falklands
War.
However, Amnesty International confirmed it was asking Sir Nicholas Lyell,
Britain's attorney-general, to prosecute Gen Pinochet under the Criminal
Justice Act which obliges the UK to pursue alleged torturers.
The Foreign Office stressed that there were no official or ministerial
contacts involved.

<TEXT>
The achievement of the Uruguay Round of global trade talks 'is still far
from complete' and European Union leaders must treat its ratification with
urgency, Mr Peter Sutherland, director-general of the General Agreement on
Trade and Tariffs, said in Dublin yesterday.
Mr Sutherland told a meeting of the EU economic and social committee that
Europe had 'a responsibility to give leadership on ratification' by the 125
states that signed the Gatt agreements in Marrakesh in April.
The World Trade Organisation (WTO) which will replace Gatt, is due to be
established by January 1, 1995 under the auspices of the Uruguay Round
agreement.
It will have stronger powers than Gatt to enforce the liberalised trade
arrangements which now extend to agri-culture, services, textiles and
intellectual property rights.
The Uruguay Round agreements 'will reward those who have embraced
competition as an ally with improved opportunities to compete in the
fastest-growing markets in the world - the upper-income developing
countries'.

FT  14 JUN 94 / World Trade News: New hope for clothes makers - A look at
the Caribbean welcome for US tariff plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Caribbean garment producers have greeted with relief proposals by the US
government to remove tariffs and quotas on their exports to the US, allowing
them to compete freely with Mexican products.
The announcement of the US plans by Mr Al Gore, the vice-president, follow a
period of significant growth for the Caribbean industry, with the region now
the largest single source of US clothing imports.
The administration's proposals will be discussed by US legislators, and
follow several months of appeals by Caribbean governments for measures to
protect their US markets, not only for apparel, from Mexican competition.
Most Caribbean Basin governments fear that the implementation of the North
American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), would enable Mexico to capture
valuable markets which the less efficient Caribbean producers had developed
in the US and Canada.
In announcing the plans for Caribbean Basin clothing imports, Mr Gore said
the administration would ask Congress to approve the removal of all tariffs
and quotas on textile and clothing imports from the 24 countries which are
beneficiaries of the Caribbean Basin Initiative. This trade programme,
implemented 10 years ago by the US government, allows designated countries
to ship some products duty free to the US. However, garments and textiles
were excluded from this after pressure from the US industry which feared a
flood of cheap imports.
'I am convinced that this initiative will accelerate economic co-operation
and growth in the Caribbean region as well as in the United States,' Mr Gore
said.
Caribbean producers whose exports are valued at Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.6bn)
per year, and whose industries provide 400,000 jobs in a labour surplus
region, have welcomed the US government's proposals. 'This is a very
positive development,' said Mr Peter King, chairman of the Central American
and Caribbean Textile and Apparel Council, a regional lobby group for the
industry.
Most of the region's apparel exports to the US are produced under the 807
offshore assembly programme. This allows garments to be assembled in the
region from fabric made and cut in the US, and re-exported to the US with
duty paid on the value added in assembly.
The fears of losing US markets to Mexico led Caribbean Basin governments,
with the support of some US legislators, to ask the Nafta partners for
'parity' with Mexico in accessing the US and Canadian markets. Regional
trade officials say the US administration's proposals for the garment
industry are a welcome indicator that other sectors of Caribbean industry
may be treated similarly.
Mr Paul Robertson, Jamaica's foreign trade minister, said: 'While this
proposal on the garment industry does not constitute the Nafta parity for
Caribbean Basin countries which the region had asked for, it represents an
enhancement by expanding access to the US market for textile and apparel.
'This is a step in the right direction and we hope that the proposed
programme is open-ended and represents a transition to full participation in
Nafta.'
The growing importance of the clothing sector to the Caribbean has been
underscored by recent figures from the Textile and Apparel Council. In the
year to March the Caribbean Basin countries overtook major producers such as
China and Taiwan to become the leading source of US imports.
Caribbean Basin exports to the US in the year were valued at Dollars 4.1bn,
representing 14.1 per cent of all US imports, the council said. Hong Kong's
share was 13.4 per cent, China's 12.1 per cent, and Taiwan's 7.6 per cent.
The leading Caribbean Basin exporter to the US in the year to March was the
Dominican Republic, with exports valued at Dollars 1.4bn.
There is, however, one dark cloud on the horizon, said Mr King. Significant
quantities of garments, mainly from Asia, are labelled as being of Caribbean
origin, and are either being shipped through the region or sent directly to
the US. 'This illegal trade can do more damage to the Caribbean Basin
industry than can any high tariff wall,' said Mr King.

FT  14 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Diesel engine maker forms China link
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Perkins Group, the UK-based diesel engine producer, yesterday announced a
long-term partnership agreement which will see its engines produced in China
for the first time.
The UK company, part of Varity of the US, has signed a technology transfer
contract under which two of its engine families will enter volume production
at Tianjin Engine Works in eastern China.
Perkins sees the agreement as a big breakthrough in China, the world's
fastest-growing diesel engine market. The 10-year agreement with Tianjin,
one of China's leading diesel engine manufacturers, is expected to lead to a
joint venture deal.
Mr Tony Gilroy, chief executive of Perkins, said the agreement was 'a very
important step in developing our presence in China and is part of our
increasing focus on south and east Asia'.
A 'vast potential' existed for Perkins engines throughout China, and the
company was committed to becoming the leading independent manufacturer of
diesel engines in China in partnership with Tianjin, he added.
The contract covers Perkins' Phaser automotive engines and its 1000 Series
industrial range. The first units will be assembled and tested in Tianjin
early next year and annual production could reach 120,000 engines by 2000.
Mr Miao Jianxin, a director of Tianjin, said the agreement with Perkins
provided China with a framework to develop its diesel engine industry at a
vital stage in its economic progress. 'It will offer customers a new range
of high-technology products, and boost the local economy.'
The agreement with Tianjin Engine brings to 12 the number of countries where
Perkins diesel engines are built. Perkins already has close links with India
and Indonesia. Tianjin Engine employs 7,000 people in Tianjin, China's third
largest city.

FT  14 JUN 94 / Grande idee - shame about the building
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
First there was the French assault on 'US cultural imperialism' during last
year's world trade negotiations; then came rumours of a Hollywood boycott of
the Cannes Film Festival; now the French are back on the offensive in a row
over the American Centre, the latest incarnation of the cultural institute
that has since the 1930s been a mecca for intellectually-inclined Americans
in Paris.
Even the most chauvinistic members of the French intelligentsia have failed
to find fault with the aims of the new centre, which opened last week as a
vast cultural complex including a theatre, language school, art gallery and
artists' studios. It is, after all, an icon of francophilia and, as such,
conforms completely to the Gallic definition of an intelligent arts
institution.
Instead the arts establishment has vented its wrath on the new building,
which was designed by Frank Gehry, the Los Angeles-based architect. The New
York Times hailed his design as a 'love poem'. Le Figaro, the conservative
French daily, disagreed. 'We expected a great deal from the first major
French project of this great expressionist. And we've been sadly
disappointed,' grumbled Francis Rambert, its architecture critic.
The crux of the criticism is that Gehry, who has achieved international
acclaim for his 'urban jungle' buildings in Los Angeles, reflecting the
chaos of the city through fragmented forms and clashing colours, has fobbed
off the French with a watered-down version of his Californian work.
'Jeez, what do they want from me?' groaned the architect, who paid a flying
visit to Paris for the opening. 'I know what it is - a jumble of everything
I've already done in LA. But I did all that stuff in the context of Los
Angeles. This is Paris. I did not want to rebuild LA here. That would have
been terrible]'
The American Centre is an understated building, at least by the standards of
Gehry, who once designed a Venice Beach office block as a giant pair of
binoculars. The main facade is an explosion of different shapes which, he
said, were inspired by 'those wonderful jumbled roofs you see when you
really look at Paris', although he has softened the cacophonic effect by
using classic French sandstone as his main material. The soft curves and
seductive skylights of the interior are Gehry's homage to Ronchamp, the Le
Corbusier chapel in eastern France, which is one of his favourite buildings.
Even this tribute to France's architectural heritage (the French prefer to
forget that Le Corbusier was born in Switzerland) has failed to placate the
critics. 'We might ask why so many great contemporary architects seem to
save their B-grade work for France?' sniped Le Figaro.
France has historically prided itself on its cosmopolitan attitude to the
arts: not least on its appreciation of the finer aspects of US culture, from
the jazz of Miles Davis and Charlie Parker, to the experimental drama for
which the American Centre was famous in the 1960s.
Yet this cosmopolitanism was founded on an unquestioned confidence in the
strength of France's own cultural credentials. That confidence has been
dented by the economic and social turmoil of recent years. Jacques Toubon,
the centre-right arts minister, has responded with a string of protectionist
policies - from his anti-American stance at the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade negotiations, to his clampdown on Franglais. Gehry is the latest
victim of France's cultural insecurity.
He has had plenty of practice in the firing line. His uncompromising style
has few fans in the US public sector. 'They don't even think I'm fit to
build a dog kennel,' he says.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Western German wholesale prices climbed 0.5 per cent in May from April and
rose 1.1 per cent from April 1993, the federal statistics office said
yesterday. Most economists had expected a month-on-month rise of only 0.2
per cent and a year-on-year increase of 0.7 per cent. The May figures also
represent an acceleration from the previous two months. In April, the index
for wholesale prices rose 0.2 per cent in the month and 0.5 per cent in the
year; in March, the index climbed only 0.1 per cent in the month and 0.2 per
cent in the year. Analysts attributed the increase to rising commodity and
oil prices that were not offset by the weaker dollar in the month. Some of
the biggest month-on-month price gains came directly from commodities: a 23
per cent jump in coffee prices, 5.5 per cent in fruit prices, 4.4 per cent
in pigs for slaughter, and 3 per cent in grains.
Switzerland's industrial production in the first quarter rose 7 per cent
from the same period in 1993, the government statistics office announced
yesterday. Incoming orders rose 10 per cent in the same period, with
business from abroad up 13 per cent and orders from domestic customers up 6
per cent.
The official Swedish unemployment rate decreased to 7.1 per cent in May from
7.4 per cent in April and was down from 7.5 per cent in May 1993, according
to official figures.
Norway's trade surplus in May fell to NKr4.88bn (Pounds 448m) compared with
NKr6.78bn (Pounds 622m) the same month a year earlier, according to the
country's statistical agency. Austrian building output rose nearly a fifth
in the first quarter, increasing 19.6 per cent to Sh21bn (Pounds 1.9bn) the
central statistics office said.

Negotiations on a treaty to open up the former Soviet energy sector to

main aim is to provide better investment protection. The treaty gives legal
force to the political declaration signed by heads of government three years
ago. The agreement follows several months of argument over how far CIS
countries would be prepared to guarantee equal treatment for western and
national companies wanting to invest in their energy sector. The text of the
treaty will next be submitted to governments for approval, with a view to
signing it in September or October. Emma Tucker, Brussels

The UN yesterday condemned Sunday's rocket attack on a Serb-held town of
Brcko in northern Bosnia where several civilians were wounded. In a separate
incident at the weekend, British troops came under mortar and small-arms
fire in central Bosnia. However, UN officials said the country-wide truce
agreed last week appeared to be holding. Commander Eric Chaperon, the UN
Protection Force spokesman in Sarajevo, said fighting continued to decrease
substantially over the weekend, 'indicating continuing compliance with at
least a spirit of the cessation of hostilities agreements'. The UN's special
envoy to the former Yugoslavia, Yasushi Akashi, described the firing of
rockets at Serb-held Brcko as 'reprehensible'. A statement released from UN
headquarters in Zagreb said the rockets were fired from the nearby Orasje
pocket, where Bosnian, Croat and Moslem units are deployed. The Bosnian Serb
commander, General Ratko Mldic, warned of retaliation if the attacks
continued.

Romania's main opposition party yesterday started unprecedented moves to
impeach President Ion Iliescu for violating the country's constitution. The
National Peasants Party said it had begun to collect signatures needed for a
motion in parliament to impeach the president on the grounds that he tried
to pervert the course of justice and to undermine the independence of the
judiciary. The party is basing its case on statements Mr Iliescu made last
month in which he urged local courts not to return property nationalised
under the Communist regime to former owners. Parliament, which is dominated
by Mr Iliescu's supporters, is not expected to approve the motion, the first
of its kind in post-Communist Romania. The move coincides with
anti-government demonstrations planned today by leading trade unions calling
for higher pay and faster reform.

<TEXT>
Creditors of the Jurgen Schneider property group can expect their first
payment since the group went bankrupt in April, the Frankfurt state
prosecutors' office said yesterday. The German officials said that on a
visit to Geneva last week they had found documentary proof that DM245m
(Pounds 98m) of the property group's funds had been moved by Mr Jurgen
Schneider and his wife Claudia. They said the money had been transferred in
late March to Switzerland via London and the Bahamas shortly before the
couple's disappearance triggered Germany's biggest property crash in
decades. Of the DM245m, all but DM15m was likely to be made available to
meet creditors' claims, the Frankfurt officials said yesterday. The DM230m
has been frozen by the Geneva prosecutors' office for some weeks pending an
inquiry into possible money-laundering offences. The DM15m was transferred
out of the Geneva accounts in late March and has not yet been traced.
It is thought likely that Mr Schneider managed to transfer other cash,
perhaps as much as DM750m in total, from Germany in March before he went on
the holiday to Tuscany from which he never returned. A warrant has been
issued for his arrest on fraud charges but his whereabouts are still
unknown, although the mass circulation Bild newspaper suggested yesterday
that he is living in a villa in the Iranian city of Isfahan. The newspaper
claimed that Mr Schneider bought a DM14m villa there last year in
association with Mr Mehdi Djawadi, an Iranian friend and business associate
arrested earlier this month on suspicion of helping him transfer funds
abroad ahead of his flight.

FT  14 JUN 94 / Hopes rise for EU-Russia pact
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LUXEMBOURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Hopes of wrapping up a new political and trade agreement between the
European Union and Russia rose last night after European foreign ministers
came within an ace of resolving the remaining obstacles.
Barring last-minute reservations from the Netherlands, ministers rallied
round an agreed text which keeps alive Greek plans to host President Boris
Yeltsin at next week's European summit in Corfu.
At the Luxembourg meeting, ministers were seeking to respond positively to a
Franco-German call for the EU to agree on measures to reform Ukraine's
nuclear industry and meet part of the cost of shutting the Chernobyl
reactor.
President Leonid Kravchuk is expected to sign a new partnership agreement
with the EU in Luxembourg tomorrow, a sign of a more even-handed EU strategy
toward Ukraine and Russia.
The EU-Russia pact has been beset with difficulties, but divisions have
narrowed to Russia's treatment of foreign banks and how the EU handles
Moscow's exports of enriched uranium.
Equally sensitive is Mr Yeltsin's demands that he personally sign the
agreement. He has refused to initial it, even though Brussels has warned it
may be hard to translate the texts into the requisite 10 languages in time
for Corfu.
On foreign banking, Mr Yeltsin announced a new decree last Friday which
appeared to ease fears that western banks would be subject to strict new
capital requirements. The Dutch, with two banks in Russia, want to see proof
in writing and have therefore reserved approval of the final treaty text.
The picture on uranium exports improved after France obtained safeguards to
protect its position as a leading supplier to the rest of the Union.
Yesterday, the European Commission was able to satisfy reservations by
Portugal which has a small uranium industry.
Nuclear safety in Ukraine will be high on the agenda of the Group of Seven
industrialised nations in Naples next month. As the international outcry
over Chernobyl has mounted, Ukraine raised its price for shutting it from
Dollars 2bn to Dollars 14bn.
A Commission official said the EU was seeking to balance its interest in
promoting Ukraine's policy toward energy self-sufficiency - which includes
building five new nuclear reactors - with the need to shut down Chernobyl.

FT  14 JUN 94 / Split over MEP role in Maastricht review: Corfu summit may
have to settle the issue after foreign ministers fail to agree
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LUXEMBOURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
European Union foreign ministers were split yesterday on how closely to
involve members of the European Parliament in the 1996 constitutional review
of the Maastricht treaty. As a result, next week's summit of the 12 heads of
government in Corfu will probably have to deal with the issue.
In May, the parliament demanded a voice at least equal to that of the
European Commission in the 1996 inter-governmental conference as the price
of ratifying the accession treaties for Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway.
The MEPs won promises from Germany, the Benelux countries, the Commission
and the current Greek presidency of the EU, that they would be closely
involved in the 'committee of experts' which is due to start work in middle
of next year to prepare the review.
Yesterday, however, the UK and France stuck to the formula foreign ministers
agreed in April at Ioannina, Greece, where they also agreed a compromise on
the EU voting rights dispute, over which parliament had threatened to reject
enlargement and which will be at the heart of the 1996 review.
Under this formula, MEPs' constitutional experts would be associated with
and could contribute to the group, made up of foreign ministers'
representatives, but not be an organic part of it.
'A majority of member states would prefer association,' claimed Mr Alain
Juppe, French foreign minister, in order to retain their 'freedom of
manoeuvre'.
But relegation to second-class status is certain to infuriate most MEPs when
the newly-elected parliament assembles in Strasbourg next month.
Of the near record 468 MEPs present at May's enlargement vote, 150 voted to
postpone ratification until parliament received cast-iron guarantees on the
constitutional review. When the ratification vote was taken, 60 die-hards
abstained, although they backed EU expansion in principle.
But they were joined afterwards by many other leading MEPs, who warned that
parliament could use its powers to hold up other EU external treaties in the
future unless it was fully involved in preparing the EU's constitutional
arrangements.

<TEXT>
The return of British Airways yesterday to Orly airport after a 20-year
absence was marred by noisy and at times violent protest demonstrations,
writes Paul Betts at Orly Airport. Some 200 employees of the small French
independent carrier Air Liberte tried to stop passengers from checking in on
flights operated by BA and its French affiliate TAT, leading to scuffles and
three arrests.
The protesters failed to stop the four BA and TAT services, although the
flights suffered delays and passengers were forced to check in inside the
terminal departure lounge.
Although restricted to only four return flights a day, BA in partnership
with TAT is seeking to operate up to 11 daily return flights from Orly to
Heathrow starting in October. Air Liberte's chief executive, said yesterday
was the beginning of an airport landing and take-off slots 'war'.

FT  14 JUN 94 / Obituary: Jan Tinbergen, a father of econometrics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Jan Tinbergen, the distinguished Dutch mathematical economist, socialist and
pacifist, has died at the age of 91. Tinbergen won the first Nobel memorial
prize in economics in 1969, jointly with the Norwegian Ragnar Frisch,
principally for his seminal work on the application of statistics to
economics. His work in this area, for the League of Nations between 1936 and
1938 and published in 1939, marked the birth of modern econometrics.
Tinbergen brought three fundamental attributes to his work in economics and
economic policy: his training as a mathematical physicist at Leiden
University, his social idealism, and his conviction that a better world
could be created by applying reason to the operations of government. Of his
intellectual power, personal benevolence and moral rectitude there was never
the slightest doubt. But his faith in the capacity and benevolence of the
state now looks a little naive.
Even econometrics, in whose early development Tinbergen played so great a
part, was (and, to an extent, still is) controversial. The first of his two
volumes for the League of Nations, on fluctuations in investment, was
reviewed quite critically by the British economist John Maynard Keynes. But
Tinbergen had the last laugh. His second volume presented an economy-wide
model of business cycles in the US. Models of this kind were the vehicle
through which Keynesian economics was subsequently implemented.
Today's economic forecasting industry owes its existence to Tinbergen's
pioneering work. But he also made substantial contributions to the modelling
of economic growth and to theories of policy formation, economic development
and personal income distribution.
His most important contribution, after that to econometrics, was the
demonstration that, in general, the achievement of a given number of policy
objectives requires as many independent policy instruments. This conclusion
was reached in parallel by the British economist (and Nobel-laureate) James
Meade.
Tinbergen was born in The Hague on April 12, 1903, into a remarkable family
of scholars. One of his brothers, Nikolaas (Niko), won the Nobel Prize for
biology in 1973; another became a professor of zoology.
Tinbergen refused compulsory military service in 1927 and was sent to work
for almost a year as a prison administrator and research assistant at the
official statistics bureau, the CBS. After gaining his doctorate in physics
from Leiden in 1929, he went back to work at the CBS, where he started
research into economic dynamics and statistical modelling of economies.
After leaving the League of Nations, he returned to the Netherlands, staying
with the CBS until the end of the second world war.
Then, he was appointed head of the newly-established Dutch planning and
economic advisory body, the CPB. He resigned from the CPB in 1955, to become
a full-time professor at the University of Rotterdam (where he had been
part-time between 1933 and 1955). In 1973 he moved to the University of
Leiden, before retiring in 1975. He served as an adviser to the World Bank,
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, and UN bodies.

FT  14 JUN 94 / Italy faces Pounds 13.3bn extra pension bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM and ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME, MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Berlusconi government is studying ways to respond to a constitutional
court decision that would add L30,000bn (Pounds 13.4bn)to this year's
spending on pensions.
The estimate by Mr Clementi Mastella, the Labour Minister, follows a
decision to repay some arrears back to 1983. The announcement led to an
immediate fall in Italian government bond prices.
If the amount has to be paid in full, it would have a serious effect on
public finances and undermine calculations both about the need for a
pre-summer mini-budget and for the preparation of the 1995 budget.
Last Friday the constitutional court ruled on a long-standing case brought
by pensioners who claimed to have been denied proper state pensions dating
back to 1983. In that year, the government sought to reduce the benefits
available to people who had been able to obtain full pensions, even though
they had not made the necessary financial contributions.
The court ruling obliges the government to make good the difference between
the reduced benefits and the full pension entitlement denied as of 1983. As
many as 600,000 people could be involved.
Initially it was thought the one-off cost of funding arrears would be
L6,000bn. But over the weekend the estimates were revised sharply upwards.
It is also thought the additional annual burden after the payment of arrears
would be more than L600bn.
The court's decision is a further example of how over recent years the
courts have given favourable interpretations to actions brought in defence
of pensions, so helping to make Italy's state-run system the most costly and
deficit-ridden in Europe. The government will find it difficult to
circumvent the ruling.
The decision comes as economy ministers are weighing the need for a
mini-budget before the summer recess to hold the public sector deficit to
about L154,000bn. This compares with the original estimate of L145,000bn,
equivalent to 8.7 percent of GDP.
The previous Ciampi government had indicated a mini-budget was needed to
find some L7,000bn to L10,000bn in a combination of spending cuts and extra
revenues. However, Mr Giancarlo Pagliarini, the budget minister, said
yesterday he believed the mini-budget need raise no more than L5,000bn. But
there are those within the cabinet who want to avoid a mini-budget
altogether, to encourage the timid recovery and concentrate efforts on the
1995 budget.
If the government has to pay the pension arrears, then a mini-budget would
be inevitable. Given prime minister Silvio Berlusconi's aversion to raising
taxes, he would rely mainly on spending cuts. The court ruling has
highlighted once again the need for Italy to curb the mounting deficit in
its generous state pensions scheme and to shift the burden on to pension
funds.

FT  14 JUN 94 / Nordic No camp put on defensive

<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The strong anti-European Union campaigns in Finland, Norway and Sweden have
been put on the defensive by the decisive vote in Austria on Sunday in
favour of EU membership.
'The result took them by surprise,' said Mr Arve Thorvik, leader of a group
of former prominent anti-EU campaigners in Norway who now support entry. 'A
No vote in Austria would definitely have had an impact, strengthening the No
campaign here. But the two-thirds majority for the Yes side is a vitamin
shot for us. It shows opinion can be turned around.'
Although the No side trails in Finland, where a referendum will be held in
October, in Sweden and Norway the Yes campaign has a long way to go to
overturn EU opponents before both countries vote in November. By then, the
Austrian result will be a distant memory.
Mr Kristen Nygaard, leader of Norway's No to the EU organisation, admitted
the Austrian result deprived his campaign of a boost. But he insisted: 'I
don't believe that the referendum in Austria will have any effect on the
Norwegian EU debate.'
Ms Eva-Britt Svensson, co-leader of the Swedish 'No to the EU' campaign,
said that in Austria the No side lacked a strong organisation, unlike in
Sweden where her organisation acts as a national umbrella for a broad range
of political opinion united by hostility to the EU. She also said extreme
right-wing attempts to scare voters in Austria into voting against
membership had alienated many people.
In Iceland, meanwhile, Mr Jon Baldvin Hannibalsson, foreign minister and
Social Democratic party leader, said Reykjavik might apply for EU membership
by the end of the year. Iceland has hitherto declined to seek EU membership
because of reluctance to open its fishing grounds to Union fishermen.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Leaders of the reformed communist Party of Democratic Socialism believe
their big gains in Sunday's local government elections in eastern Germany
are more than a mere blip in the party's fortunes.
'We have shown we are a force to be reckoned with at local level in the
east,' said Mr Lothar Bisky, chairman, after the party pushed ahead of the
opposition Social Democrats in urban areas.
In the northern state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the PDS won 25 per cent, 6
percentage points more than in 1990; in Saxony-Anhalt, which will hold its
first state elections on June 26, it increased its share by 7.3 percentage
points to 20.2 per cent; in Saxony, the party's tally went up 5 points to
16.7 per cent; and in the southern state of Thuringia, it gained 4.5
percentage points to 15 per cent.
Three factors account for the party's electoral success. First, it inherited
the local grassroots organisation of the former East German Communist party
which, before unification, had 2.3m members. With 131,000 of them in the PDS
today, including 10 per cent who never belonged to the old apparatus, it has
remained active at the local level. 'That is our great strength,' said Mr
Bisky. 'The established west German parties never developed a proper
grassroots network in eastern Germany.'
Second, for easterners, the PDS is seen as a viable social democratic party,
as Mr Rudolf Scharping, head of the Social Democrats, has failed to convince
them that he has policies which are ideologically distinguishable from
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's governing Christian Democrats.
'The PDS will simply drain votes away from us,' said Ms Dagmar Szabados, SDP
deputy mayor of Halle, who was running third behind the PDS, while the CDU
mayor, Mr Klaus Rauen, was set for re-election.
Third, the PDS is seen as unsere, or 'our' party, as PDS voters repeatedly
explained on Sunday. 'We are not commies. We are not hardliners. We are east
German democratic socialists, despite what the wessi (west German)
politicians say,' said Mr Bisky.
These factors make life difficult for the SPD. Although it increased its
share of the vote in the east, it will only be able to dislodge four of the
five CDU-dominated state governments with the help of a coalition with the
Greens and the PDS.
'We cannot join with the PDS. It would be unacceptable,' said Ms Szabados.
'The only solution is that Scharping gets his act together.'
The SPD has less than two weeks to turn the tables in Saxony-Anhalt, and
four months in the other states. The recent confidence boost for the PDS
will make their struggle even harder.

FT  14 JUN 94 / Major plans cabinet reshuffle: Labour celebrates best
national election performance since 1960s
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major signalled plans last night for a wide-ranging cabinet
reshuffle next month to provide a fresh start for the government after its
European elections defeat.
As the Labour party celebrated its best performance in a national election
since the 1960s, the prime minister said he was determined to fight off any
challenge to his leadership.
Amid bright sunshine in the garden of 10 Downing Street, Mr Major underlined
a commitment to stick with his present policies in spite of what he
acknowledged had been a 'very poor' set of results.
But, acknowledging the need for new blood in the senior ranks of the
government, he gave a clear hint that a reshuffle before the summer
parliamentary recess would be more radical than hitherto imagined.
He also, in an apparent rebuke to rightwing cabinet ministers, said everyone
in the government would now abide by an agreed neutral line on UK
participation in any single European currency.
Ministers said they did not expect a 'night of the long knives' in mid July.
But Mr Major may replace four or five of his present cabinet team, leading
to large-scale changes lower down the ministerial scale.
The prime minister faced renewed pressure from friends to persuade Mr
Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, to take over as
Conservative party chairman.
Insisting that strengthening economic recovery was taking the government
above the low point in its fortunes, Mr Major dismissed any threat to his
position. Pressed on whether he might face a challenge in the autumn, he
replied: 'I don't expect one. I will be here waiting for it if there is one.
I will beat it and I will be here through the general election.'
His press conference among the rose bushes of Downing Street's garden came
amid jubilant Labour claims that the victory in the European poll marked a
'watershed' in its long march since 1979 back to electoral respectability.
Mrs Margaret Beckett, the interim Labour leader, said sweeping gains in
southern England demonstrated that Labour had won the 'mantle of trust' from
the Conservatives.
Despite winning its first seats in the Strasbourg parliament, Mr Paddy
Ashdown's Liberal Democrats saw their vote fall sharply in response to the
Labour surge. An estimated 45 per cent share of the vote gave Labour 62
seats; the Conservatives held 18 seats with 28 per cent; and the Liberal
Democrats two with 16 per cent. The Scottish Nationalists won Scotland North
East from Labour to give it two seats.
Mr Major joined Mrs Beckett in agreeing that the outcome marked a return to
'two-party' politics. With Labour almost certain to elect Mr Tony Blair as
its next leader, the Liberal Democrats face the threat of more defections to
the rival opposition party.
Mr Major faced an uncertain mood on the Tory back benches amid renewed
indications of sharp divisions over economic policy and over Europe.
Ministerial hints that the Treasury should have room before the general
election to cut taxes fuelled demands from rightwing MPs for Mr Kenneth
Clarke, the chancellor, to scrap some of the increases already pending.
Among those likely to stand down or face dismissal in the reshuffle,
ministers last night singled out Sir Norman Fowler, the party chairman, Mr
Peter Brooke, the heritage secretary, Mr John Patten, the education
secretary, and Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary. Allies of Mr
Major also want him to sack one the cabinet's right-wing Eurosceptics in
order to reassert his authority.

FT  14 JUN 94 / Rail strike is set for tomorrow as signalmen reject offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's railway signalmen are set to strike for 24 hours from midnight
tonight, in a move which threatens to paralyse the railway network.
Talks between the RMT rail union and Railtrack, the company administering
the network, broke up yesterday after half an hour when the union
negotiators walked out.
The 4,600 signalmen had been offered a pay rise of 2.5 per cent, plus a
package of measures to be negotiated, involving job evaluation, a new salary
structure and the introduction of flexible working arrangements.
Mr Jimmy Knapp, the RMT's union's general secretary, said that Railtrack's
behaviour had been 'absolutely reprehensible'.
'I have never known anything like it in my 30 years of experience in the
rail industry,' he added. 'The Railtrack board has destroyed what integrity
there was in the negotiating procedures, which are now in tatters. We have
no faith in them.'
Mr Robert Horton, Railtrack's chairman, said that he hoped that 'the union
will recognise the only realistic way forward is to sit down and start
talking'.
'Railtrack is a new company. Our most important commercial relationship is
that with our customers. That is why it is vital that we make the changes
necessary to deliver to them the level of service they require.'
The signalmen are demanding an 11 per cent interim pay rise as the condition
for entering talks on pay restructuring.
They voted decisively earlier this month to support industrial action over
their pay grievances, which have rumbled on for seven years. They say pay
relativities had been severely eroded while they had co-operated with the
introduction of new technology and a cut of nearly a third in their numbers
since 1980.
The strike is expected to shut down the entire rail network, but London
Underground services will not be affected. There may also be delays on
Thursday as many trains will be out of position. A further 24-hour stoppage
has been set for June 22.

FT  14 JUN 94 / Pay policy frozen out at leading US ice-cream maker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The cold reality that top US executives demand high salary cheques has
triumphed over pay policy idealism at Ben &amp; Jerry's Homemade, the small
Vermont company which has grown into a leading ice-cream manufacturer thanks
to its delicious, offbeat frozen concoctions and socially-conscious image.
The company, which created premium ice creams with names such as Wavy Gravy,
Chunky Monkey and Cherry Garcia, said yesterday it was discontinuing a
policy that its highest paid employee could not be paid more than seven
times the amount of its lowest paid employee.
But the company is hardly abandoning its alternative image. Launching a
search for a chief executive to aid its expansion, it said that applicants
must explain in 100 words 'Why I would be a Great CEO for Ben &amp; Jerry's'.
The contest, according to Mr Ben Cohen, the chairman who is giving up the
chief executive post, will uncover candidates who have 'both the broad
experience and gentleness of spirit necessary to guard and grow the
company's unique, community-focused culture.'
Ben &amp; Jerry's, which recently launched its ice-creams in Britain, was
founded in 1977 with a single ice-cream parlour, based in a converted petrol
station, by Mr Cohen and Mr Jerry Greenfield, its vice-chairman.
From the start they adopted a socially conscious approach to business and a
personal style reminiscent of the 1960s hippie movement.
The company donates 7.5 per cent of its pre-tax profits to a foundation
which supports non-profit organisations and charities. It also buys some of
its ice-cream ingredients from socially disadvantaged groups.
The pay ratio limit (originally set at five-to-one but changed to
seven-to-one in 1991) was designed to make employees feel they were working
as part of a team.
The company said yesterday the ratio had served it well when it was younger
and smaller but it had become a barrier to recruiting experienced people.
Ben &amp; Jerry's had net income last year of Dollars 7.2m on revenues of
Dollars 140m but Mr Chuck Lacy, its president and top paid executive, earned
only Dollars 150,000 (Pounds 99,000), less than many senior executives at
businesses of this size.

FT  14 JUN 94 / Amstrad to pay Pounds 60m for direct sales PC company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Amstrad, the consumer electronics group run by Mr Alan Sugar, yesterday
agreed to pay around Pounds 60m in cash to acquire Viglen, a private company
which builds and sells personal computers directly to its customers.
The deal marks a significant change in direction for Amstrad which has seen
its own PC sales and profits tumble in the face of growing competition in
the high street market.
Mr Sugar, Amstrad's chairman and founder, said the acquisition would add 'an
exciting new dimension' to the group's existing business. Amstrad's shares
closed up  1/4 p at 31 3/4 p.
Viglen ranks about third in UK direct PC sales with about a 7 per cent share
of the market. Direct sales last year accounted for about one-third of all
PCs sold. Last year the group posted pre-tax profits before directors'
emoluments and exceptional items of Pounds 9m in the year to March 31 on
turnover of Pounds 72m, up 33 per cent over sales a year earlier.
Mr Sugar said gross margins at Viglen were around 25 per cent. Amstrad is
acquiring assets worth Pounds 13.6m. 'The acquisition provides Amstrad with
the opportunity to purchase a fast-growing business which both complements
and strengthens Amstrad's existing business,' he said.
Viglen will continue to operate as 'an autonomous unit' within the group and
will maintain its current management structure, selling methods, products
and customer service. The senior management team is being 'locked in' with
new service contracts for a minimum of 42 months.
Under the terms of the deal, which is subject to Amstrad shareholder
approval, the group will pay the vendors Pounds 30m in cash initially and a
further Pounds 30m over the next three years, subject to Viglen's
profitability.
If Viglen's profits exceed Pounds 27m in the first three years the vendors -
five key members of Viglen's management team - will receive a share of the
additional profits.
Amstrad will finance the acquisition using part of its cash reserves which
were Pounds 135m last month, but which total around Pounds 150m on a
normalised basis.
Mr Sugar said the Viglen acquisition was being made in order to provide a
new source of profits and growth for the group and that the price
represented a price/earnings multiple of 10.

FT  14 JUN 94 / Fears raised over splits in EU parliament
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH and LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, LUXEMBOURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Governments across Europe yesterday expressed concern about the
fragmentation of the European parliament after elections that saw a strong
shift to the right on the Continent offset by Labour's sweeping victory in
the UK.
In the immediate aftermath of the results, Mr Achille Occhetto resigned as
leader of the Democratic Party of the Left, the main Italian opposition
party. And Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, signalled a
possibly more nationalist stance by his government.
Polling last Thursday and on Sunday was dominated by a mixture of protest
voting and apathy in many EU member states.
The new 567-member parliament, in which Socialist and allied parties look
likely to form the largest grouping with an estimated 213 seats, will have
increased powers.
But the record low turnout across Europe - down to 56.5 per cent from 58.5
per cent in the last election in 1989 - may constrain the parliament's
abilty to play a fuller role as the EU's sole directly-elected institution.
In spite of the strong showing by conservatives in Germany, Italy, Spain,
Netherlands and Denmark, co-operation among rightwing MEPs in the new
parliament is likely to be hampered by bickering over the composition of the
European People's party group, traditionally dominated by Christian
Democrats.
Fragmentation of the rightwing presence has been increased by the strong
showing of Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia movement,
which won 30.6 per cent of the votes, up nearly 10 points from the general
elections in March.
Mr Leo Tindemans, a former Belgian premier and leader of the EPP in
Strasbourg, insisted yesterday that his grouping did not want to work with
Forza Italia on account of the latter's coalition alliance with
neo-fascists.
Meanwhile, senior German officials expressed concern about the risk of
unpredictable factions in the parliament disrupting Bonn's plan to work
closely with the newly-elected assembly.
They drew attention to the election of maverick French and Italian MEPs from
the right which could leave between 80 and 100 MEPs unattached to formal
left or rightwing party groupings at Strasbourg.
Bonn's worries about co-operation with the parliament when Germany takes
over the six-monthly EU presidency next month took some gloss off the
surprise victory by Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats in Sunday's
poll. A confident Mr Kohl predicted yesterday he would win the country's
general election in October .
In France, Mr Balladur voicedconcern about the diversity of policies and
parties represented in Strasbourg. 'Fragmentation among too many lists
threatens to weaken France at a European level,' he said. He added that the
poll, which resulted in a sharp swing to left and rightwing French dissident
parties, had shown that voters wanted French interests to be better
represented in Europe.
Elsewhere, ministers and officials warned about the twin dangers of voter
indifference and the swing to anti-Maastricht parties.
Mr Niels Helveg Petersen, the Danish foreign minister, said the low turnout
was 'really disappointing', while Mr Hans Van den Broek, the Brussels
commissioner for external political affairs, said: 'The credibility of the
European union and our institutions are at stake.'
It also emerged yesterday that Mr Kohl is playing a crucial role in trying
to achieve a compromise over the succession to Mr Jacques Delors as
president of the European Commission.
Mr Berlusconi is to meet Mr Kohl in Bonn on Thursday in the Italian leader's
first high-level European diplomatic meeting since assuming office a month
ago.
Italy is being courted furiously by the contenders for the presidency job,
including Sir Leon Brittan, chief EU trade negotiator, Mr Ruud Lubbers,
prime minister of the Netherlands, and Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian
premier, who is being backed by France and Germany.

Germany

Correction (published 15th June 1994) appended to this article.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl could not disguise his glee, nor wipe the smile from
his face, when he appeared on German television close to midnight on Sunday.
His Christian Democratic Union had confounded the opinion polls and the
pundits, and emerged from the European elections stronger than in 1989. The
party saw an increase of 2.5 percentage points in its support, in spite of a
sharp economic recession and record unemployment levels in both halves of
the country.
He saw it, justifiably, as vindication for his absolute self-confidence, and
a refusal to bow to apparent unpopularity in the polls. In particular, he
forced his party to fight the campaign on a platform of firm commitment to
European integration, in spite of signs that the policy could be unpopular.
Mr Rudolf Scharping, leader of the Social Democratic party (SPD) and his
challenger for the chancellorship next October, looked bemused: his party,
only four weeks ago enjoying a clear lead in public favour, had lost more
than 5 percentage points, and recorded its worst result in a European
election since they began in 1979.
The expectations had been for a strong protest vote and a low turnout.
Everyone cautioned against reading too much into the result to predict what
will happen in October. But the protest turned out to be against the main
party of opposition, and the turnout was respectable at nearly 60 per cent.
It was a day of unlikely bedfellows: a good day for Mr Kohl and for the
Greens, who also improved their 1989 showing by a couple of percentage
points. Mr Kohl's Bavarian allies, the Christian Social Union (CSU), lost a
little support, but still emerged handsome victors in their home state -
with easily enough backing to win seats in the parliament. And the Party of
Democratic Socialism, the former East German communist party, almost made it
to Strasbourg, thanks to a strong vote in the five eastern Lander.
On the other hand, it was not only a severe setback for Mr Scharping and his
party.
It was a bad day for Mr Kohl's junior partners in the coalition, the Free
Democratic party (FDP), which failed to get the 5 per cent support necessary
for seats in parliament.
It was also a bad day for the far-right Republicans, down from 7.1 per cent
in 1989 to 3.9 per cent.
Last of all it was a bad day for the anti-Maastricht campaigners, such as Mr
Manfred Brunner's Free Citizens' Alliance, which just managed 1.1 per cent
support.
On the whole, the German electorate was conservative with a small c,
sticking to the devils they knew: Mr Kohl in the west, the CSU in Bavaria,
and the old communists in the east, along with the CDU.
In spite of the surprising changes, the outlook for October remains too
close to call. On each side of the political divide, neither combined left
nor combined right can command a clear coalition majority on the basis of
these figures.
The FDP, on past experience, must be expected to squeak back over the 5 per
cent hurdle for the national election in October. The PDS can be expected to
do the same. The Republicans, for the time being, appear to be finished. If
neither the SPD nor the CDU can break out of support at around one-third of
the electorate, they may be condemned to form a grand coalition.

CORRECTION
Owing to a transmission fault, yesterday's edition carried a list of German
Free Democratic Party MEPs elected to the European parliament. Because the
FDP scored less than 5 per cent of the vote in the elections in Germany, no
MEPs from this party will sit in the new parliament.

FT  14 JUN 94 / Right gains in Germany and Spain: Kohl's party scores
surprising win in Euro poll - Gonzalez's Socialists defeated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats scored a surprising victory in
the German leg of yesterday's European parliament elections.
In Spain, the Socialist party of Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez suffered
defeat at the hands of the opposition conservative Popular party.
In preliminary results among the other six countries that went to the polls
yesterday, governing parties suffered setbacks in Portugal but maintained
their positions in Greece, Belgium and Luxembourg.
In the UK, where voting took place on Thursday, sharp divisions in the
ruling Conservative party over Europe and Mr John Major's leadership emerged
again last night as the government prepared to face its worst defeat in a
national election since the second world war.
Amid predictions that the Conservatives would hold on to at most half of
their 32 seats in the European parliament, Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign
secretary, signalled the start of a concerted cabinet operation to shore up
Mr Major's premiership.
The shift to the right in Germany and Spain was expected to be offset by
gains by leftwing parties elsewhere in the European Union, leading to a
small overall increase in the Socialist representation in the 567-seat,
12-nation parliament in Strasbourg.
The combined total of Mr Kohl's Christian Democrats and its Bavarian sister
party, the Christian Social Union, was forecast to rise to 40.5 per cent
from 37.7 per cent in the previous Euro election of 1989, according to an
exit poll carried out for the ZDF television station.
In contrast, the opposition Sociali Democratic (SPD) party was projected to
slump to its worst result since direct European elections began, down from
37.3 in 1989 to just 33 per cent.
The ZDF forecast that the CDU/CSU could take 48 of Germany's 99 seats in the
Strasbourg parliament, against 39 for the SPD and 12 for the Greens.
The liberal Free Democratic party, junior partner in Mr Kohl's coalition
government in Bonn, looked set to lose its place in Strasbourg, along with
the far-right Republicans.
The Republicans, the feared bogeymen of Germany's far right, also seemed to
have suffered a dramatic setback. The poll suggested a halving of support
from 7.1 per cent in 1989 to 3.5 per cent.
In Spain, exit polls put the Popular party's result at between 38-40 per
cent and 40 per cent of the vote, giving it between 26 and 28 of Spain's 64
seats. Mr Gonzalez' Socialists were projected as gaining only 29-31 per cent
of the vote.
Polls also predicted that Spain's Socialists would lose their absolute
majority in the regional parliament in Andalusia in elections held in
parallel with the European poll.
In Portugal, the opposition Socialists appeared to be heading for victory
with 35-39 per cent. But Greece's governing Socialist Panhellenic Socialist
Movement looked set to win that country's vote, with exit polls giving it
38-42 per cent of the vote.
Early projections put the Socialist grouping's strength in the new
Strasbourg assembly at 203 plus a further nine allies from France, compared
with 197 in the old parliament. Rightwing parties' showing in the parliament
was expected to be more fragmented compared with 1989.

FT  14 JUN 94 / Amstrad enters direct PC sales with Pounds 60m purchase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Amstrad, the UK-based consumer electronics group run by Mr Alan Sugar, has
agreed to pay around Pounds 60m (Dollars 91m) in cash to acquire Viglen, a
private company which builds and sells personal computers directly to its
customers.
The deal marks a change in direction for Amstrad which has seen its own PC
sales and profits tumble in the face of growing competition.
Mr Sugar, Amstrad's chairman and founder, said the acquisition would add 'an
exciting new dimension' to the group's businesses. Amstrad's shares closed
up 1/4p at 31 3/4p.
Viglen ranks about third in the UK direct PC sales arena with about 7 per
cent of a market which last year accounted for about one third of all PC
sales. The group posted pre-tax profits before directors' emoluments and
exceptional items of Pounds 9m in the year to March 31, from Pounds 7.9m, on
turnover of Pounds 72m, up 33 per cent.
Mr Sugar said gross margins at Viglen were around 25 per cent. Amstrad is
acquiring assets worth Pounds 13.6m. Under the terms of the deal, which is
subject to Amstrad shareholder approval, the group will pay Pounds 30m in
cash initially and a further Pounds 30m over the next three years subject to
Viglen's profitability.
If Viglen's profits exceed Pounds 27m over the first three years the vendors
 -five members of Viglen's management team - will receive a share of the
additional profits.
Amstrad will finance the acquisition using part of its cash reserves.
Mr Sugar said Viglen will continue to operate as 'an autonomous unit' within
his group and will maintain its management structure, selling methods,
products and customer service. The senior management team is being 'locked
in' with new contracts for a minimum of 42 months.
Mr Sugar said the Viglen acquisition would provide a new source of profits
and growth for the group and the price represented a price/earnings multiple
of 10. 'The acquisition provides Amstrad with the opportunity to purchase a
fast-growing business which both complements and strengthen's Amstrad's
existing business,' he said.
Mr Sugar originally ap-proached Viglen in October and shareholders had been
persuaded that a sale to Amstrad was a better alternative to a flotation. Mr
Sugar said the sale would enable Viglen to expand its production facilities
and accelerate order delivery schedules.

FT  14 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Uruguay Round talks 'still far from
complete'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The achievement of the Uruguay Round of global trade talks 'is still far
from complete' and European Union leaders must treat its ratification with
urgency, Mr Peter Sutherland, director-general of the General Agreement on
Trade and Tariffs, said in Dublin yesterday.
Addressing a meeting of the EU economic and social committee, he said Europe
had 'a responsibility to give leadership on ratification' by the 125 states
that signed the Gatt agreements in Marrakesh in April.
This had to be given as much priority 'and political energy and commitment'
as the conclusion of the negotiations themselves.
The World Trade Organisation (WTO) which will replace Gatt, is due to be
established by January 1, 1995 under the auspices of the Uruguay Round
agreement, and will have stronger powers and procedures than Gatt to enforce
the liberalised trade arrangements which now extend to agriculture,
services, textiles and intellectual property rights.
Implementation of the Uruguay Round agreements 'will reward those who have
embraced competition as an ally with improved opportunities to compete in
the fastest-growing markets in the world - the upper-income developing
countries'.
He said a larger share of EU exports to third countries went to developing
countries 'than to North America and Japan put together', and that these had
the fastest-growing economies 'and the greatest reserves of unfulfilled
demand'.
The Uruguay Round would not only make these markets more accessible, but
greater access to EU markets for developing countries' products would in
turn further drive a growth in demand for EU goods and services.
He stressed that exporters would be better able to protect their brand name
and image under the new rules on intellectual property rights. Better
protection would enable them to develop new markets 'with more confidence
that they are not just offering counterfeiters and pirates a free ride'.

<TEXT>
US preoccupation with export expansion in Asia-Pacific should not detract
from efforts to make new ties with Europe, which shares most strongly US
views of the future of the world economy, a new report says.
'If the US is to influence significantly the rapidly emerging new global
economy, it will need allies,' say Mr Clyde Prestowitz, a former US trade
negotiator, and Mr Robin Gaster, a prominent trade consultant, in 'Shrinking
the Atlantic: Europe and the American Economy.
While Asia has become the biggest US gross export market, the content of the
trade is still a concern. Unlike trade with Europe, the US tends to exchange
raw materials for high technology goods from Asia.
'Despite transatlantic trade rows in telecommunications, aircraft and
computers, Europe remains a prime export market in each industry; the US
trade balance with Europe is strongly positive in each,' the report said.
After Britain, Japan is the second largest investor in the US, but its
investment is slowing 'drastically' while European investment is expected to
increase.
Many more European companies manufacture in the US than do Japanese.
European companies paid Dollars 7bn in corporate income taxes in 1990; Asian
companies paid only Dollars 100m.
European companies invest about Dollars 7bn in research and development in
the US, compared to Dollars 500m for Asian companies.
The report calls on North America and Europe to open exploratory talks about
broadening and deepening their relationship, resolving their differences on
such issues as labour policy, competition policy and regulation.

FT  14 JUN 94 / Nordic No camp on defensive: Strength of Austrian vote to
join EU takes 'antis' by surprise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The strong anti-European Union campaigns in Finland, Norway and Sweden have
been put on the defensive by the decisive vote in Austria on Sunday in
favour of EU membership.
'The result took them by surprise,' said Mr Arve Thorvik, leader of a group
of former prominent anti-EU campaigners in Norway who now support entry.
'A No vote in Austria would definitely have had an impact, strengthening the
No campaign here. But the two-thirds majority for the Yes side is a vitamin
shot for us. It shows opinion can be turned around.'
Although the No side trails in Finland, where a referendum will be held in
October, in Sweden and Norway the Yes campaign has a long way to go to
overturn EU opponents before both countries vote in November. By then, the
Austrian result will be little more than a distant memory.
But since Sunday night, No campaigners have found themselves in the
unaccustomed position of having to explain a defeat, rather than pursuing
their hitherto vigorous attacks on the EU and the threats they say it poses
to national independence and democracy.
Mr Kristen Nygaard, leader of Norway's 'No to the EU' organisation, admitted
the Austrian result deprived his campaign of a boost. But he insisted: 'I
don't believe that the referendum in Austria will have any effect on the
Norwegian EU debate.'
Ms Eva-Britt Svensson, co-leader of the Swedish 'No to the EU' campaign,
said that in Austria the No side lacked a strong organisation, unlike in
Sweden where her organisation acts as a national umbrella for a broad range
of political opinion united by hostility to the EU.
She also claimed that extreme right-wing attempts to scare voters in Austria
into voting against membership had alienated many people.
'Here in Sweden we will drive the debate in a different way, with factual
arguments,' she said. 'Every country makes its own choice.' In Iceland,
meanwhile, Mr Jon Baldvin Hannibalsson, foreign minister and Social
Democratic party leader, said Reykjavik might apply for EU membership by the
end of the year.
Such a move would likely be determined by whether Finland, Sweden and Norway
 -with Austria, fellow members of the European Free Trade Association -
decided to join. Iceland, also part of the European Economic Area open
markets agreement with the EU, has hitherto declined to seek membership
because of reluctance to open its fishing grounds to Union fishermen.

the share had been tipped for a strong opening - its pre-listing statement,
forecasting earnings of 72 cents a share for the next financial year up from
a pro-forma 64 cents in the year to March, was well received by the market -
its prospects have been overshadowed by a wage dispute with journalists in
the group's newspapers. Although a threatened strike by the two major press
unions appears to have been averted pending the outcome of mediation on
Tuesday, pickets are still planned outside the stock exchange this morning,
and the continued threat of industrial action is likely to deter several
prospective purchasers.

FT  13 JUN 94 / Company News (This Week): Mediobanca rights set for approval
 -Other companies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shareholders in Mediobanca, the powerful Milan merchant bank, should approve
a L1,500bn (Dollars 939.8m) rights issue at their meeting in Milan today,
although the exact price of the shares to be issued will not be set until
next week. The shareholder assembly comes exactly two weeks after Ravenna
magistrates warned top bank executives that they were under investigation
for their role as advisers to the Ferruzzi-Montedison industrial group last
year.
Mediobanca has said it is 'bitter' about the allegations that directors
conspired to issue false accounts. However, in line with its reputation for
the utmost discretion, the bank is unlikely to comment further on the affair
today.

Northern Yemeni forces pushed to within 20 miles of the southern Yemeni city
of Mukalla yesterday but were ordered not to shell it, Reuter reports from
Maifa, Yemen.
In the city, southern Yemenis welcomed UN peace envoy Lakhdar Brahimi, who
is expected to meet Ali Salem al-Baidh, president of the southern state
which seceded from a four-year union with the north on May 21.
Mr Brahimi, a former Algerian foreign minister, is trying to arrange a
ceasefire between Sanaa and Aden. He met Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh
in Sanaa last week.
Deputy prime minister Abdul-Qader Bagammal told a news conference in Sanaa
that northern troops were under orders to keep their artillery just out of
range of Mukalla, which contains many historic buildings, an airbase and an
oil export terminal.
Meanwhile northern forces have taken control of a huge central chunk of what
was, before unification in 1990, South Yemen.

FT  13 JUN 94 / US university moves to cut grade expectations: Students may
fail again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEREMY KAHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
From the autumn of 1995, a student at Stanford University in California may
actually fail a course for the first time in 24 years.
The faculty senate at Stanford, consistently ranked one of the top five
universities in the US, voted this month to reinstate the grade Fail, though
it will be called, euphemistically, 'NP' (not pass). Failing marks were
eliminated in the late 1960s in the belief that they discouraged students
from academic experimentation.
Stanford also voted that transcripts, which record course-by-course academic
performance, should more accurately reflect students' academic history.
Previously, students could drop a course up to the day before the final exam
and repeat a course as many times as they wanted, without this being
recorded on their transcripts.
Stanford is the latest battleground in the war against 'grade inflation',
the term coined to describe the noticeable rise in the average grades being
given out at colleges and universities across the US over the last 30 years.
The phenomenon, which has left some experts asking if degrees and
transcripts are worth more than the paper they are printed on, has received
widespread attention in academic circles and has even been mocked in the
popular cartoon strip Doonesbury.
Anyone who thought Doonesbury's creator Garry Trudeau was exaggerating need
look no further than Stanford, where the mean grade is A minus and 93 per
cent of the grades given out are As or Bs.
'Most of your prestigious universities have grade inflation,' says Mr Martin
Anderson, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford. 'When you
get to the point where Stanford is, I call that hyperinflation or phoney
grades.'
Mr Anderson believes even the best universities have become 'diploma mills'
churning out devalued degrees that tell little about actual academic
achievement. He warns all prospective employers and graduate schools to look
at more than transcripts and grade point averages in assessing potential.
Mr Thurston Smith, Harvard's associate registrar, disagrees. He contends
high admission standards at top schools such as his mean any graduate will
be bright and have enormous potential.
Even so, Mr Smith admits average grades at Harvard have been creeping up for
the past 20 years. 'We've done some studies on it and we know it is
happening here,' Mr Smith says. 'We don't have A-plus at Harvard so we may
have to add it. We need a grade higher than A'
It is a rare college that has escaped the phenomenon. Two of the best that
have, according to Mr Anderson, are the science-oriented Massachusetts
Institute of Technology and the University of Chicago, where Mr John Boyer,
dean of the college, says the average grade is B-minus.
While Mr Smith says grade inflation affects all academic disciplines
equally, Mr John Wakeman-Linn, a former economics professor now at the
International Monetary Fund, found in a study that it is worse in the
humanities and social sciences, where grading is more subjective.
Mr Wakeman-Linn says the promise of higher grades in these subjects is
luring students away from the so-called 'hard sciences' such as physics and
maths.
The roots of grade inflation are complex. Some experts believe it began as
an attempt by professors in the late 1960s to keep more students in college
and out of the Vietnam war. Others blame a general relaxing of conventional
academic standards in the late 1960s and early 1970s or university budgeting
that allocated money to departments based on their enrolments, encouraging
professors to inflate their grades to attract more students and thus
resources.

FT  13 JUN 94 / European Elections: SNP describe themselves as 'big winners'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Scotland looked likely to provide the Labour party with its only loss in the
European elections even though the party took half the votes north of the
border.
The Scottish National party was predicted to take the North-East Scotland
seat where the result is due to be declared later today.
A BBC projection on the basis of the six Scottish results declared overnight
put Labour at 50 per cent of the vote, the SNP at 26 per cent, the Tories at
14 per cent and the Liberal Democrats at 6 per cent.
The two remaining seats - Highlands and Islands, which the SNP is expected
to hold, and North-East Scotland - are not counted until the daytime.
The Tories, who held no Scottish seats in the previous European parliament,
saw their share of the vote slump to 14 per cent, down from 20 per cent in
1989. The nationalists claimed they would reach the crucial 30 per cent mark
beyond which they could expect huge gains in a Westminster election.
'This is a watershed moment in Scottish politics; a breakthrough in the
campaign for Scottish independence,' said Mr Alex Salmond, SNP leader. 'In
this campaign we won the argument; now we are emerging as the big winners at
the ballot box.'
Mr George Robertson, shadow Scottish secretary, described the night as a
'humiliation for the government and a triumph for Labour'.
Plaid Cymru, the Welsh nationalists, moved into second place in the
Labour-held seat of North Wales.
Among the other parties, the Greens saw the greatest loss of support, down
from the 15 per cent they achieved in the 1989 European elections to about 3
per cent.

FT  13 JUN 94 / European Elections: Bad turnout in Britain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUTLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This has been an exciting and unexpected night, David Butler writes. Britain
stays at the the bottom of the turnout league - though the 33 per cent
participation, a repeat of 1989, was matched this time by the Netherlands.
If the Liberal Democrats now appear a regional party confined to the
south-west, the Conservatives are now a party of the non-London south.
Eight recounts make a record - there have never been anything like so many
in a Euro election.
The Conservative wipe-out suggested by the Eastleigh by-election result has
not materialised, but with 27 per cent of the vote the Tories have polled 8
per cent below their previous lowest national vote this century. They have
lost to Labour every seat that they could have lost to them - and for Labour
to take Suffolk and push the Conservatives to a recount in Sussex South and
Crawley is beyond any expectation.
The Tories' comfort lies in the failure of the Liberal Democrats to break
through. Victories in the Cotswolds, in Oxfordshire and Wiltshire must
delight them.
The Conservatives have been lucky in several marginal seats but it is still
startling that with 27 per cent of the vote they are expected to get only 18
of the 87 UK seats. The electoral system, which has been so kind at
Westminster, has turned against them with a vengeance.
Labour has eliminated every Conservative north of a line from Colchester to
the Severn (except for North Yorkshire). The swing nationally was about 14
per cent, but in the London area it was 16 per cent.
David Butler is a fellow of Nuffield College, Oxford.

FT  13 JUN 94 / European Elections: Tories face defeat - but not disaster
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and DAVID BUTLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the Conservatives, it was a defeat, but not a disaster. By 2.15am, with
67 results declared, the Tories looked likely to hold 16 of their 32 seats -
much less than party strategists had hoped, but many more than they feared.
With about 27 per cent of the vote, Conservative support was running 8
percentage points behind the party's worst ever performance in a nationwide
poll.
The good news for the Tories was that the Liberal Democrat upsurge was less
dramatic than many pundits had forecast, mainly because the Labour vote held
up more strongly than expected.
Tactical voting appeared to have been confined largely to Liberal Democrat
supporters, who switched to Labour in large numbers in an attempt to kick
out Tory MEPs. Labour voters stayed largely loyal.
Among results declared, Labour had won 52 seats, the Conservatives 13, and
the Liberal Democrats 2.
The BBC forecast the final result as Labour 63 seats (up 18 on the last
election in 1989), Conservatives 18 (down 16) and Liberal Democrats two.
The BBC forecast that Labour would take 47 per cent of the final vote, up 7
percentage points on 1989, the Conservatives 27 per cent (down 8 percentage
points), the Liberal Democrats 16 per cent (up 10 percentage points), and
the Greens 5 per cent (down 10 percentage points).
Among Labour gains were Essex South, Essex West and Hertfordshire East,
Leicester, Norfolk, Northants and Blaby, London SE, London NW, Suffolk and
SW Norfolk - all from the Conservatives.
Sir Christopher Prout, the leader of the Conservative MEPs, lost to Labour
by 2,000 votes after a recount in Hereford and Shropshire.
It was a mixed night for the Liberal Democrats. The party took Somerset and
Devon North, and Cornwall, but failed to gain Wight and Hampshire South,
where the Conservatives held on narrowly.
The Conservatives also held Buckinghamshire and Oxford East, Cambridgeshire,
Essex North and Suffolk South, Hampshire North and Oxford, London South and
Surrey East, Surrey, Wight and Hampshire South, Wiltshire North, The
Cotswolds, and Thames Valley after a recount.
The Liberal Democrats were making much of having won their first seats in
Strasbourg. The party's failure to come near to victory in Surrey, and its
defeat in Wight and Hampshire South - one of their best hopes - was a
serious blow.
The party was also disappointed by its fading performance in The Cotswolds,
held by Lord Plumb, a former leader of the Conservative MEPs. However, it
came close to victory in Wiltshire North and Bath.
The enormous swings that gave Labour victory in Norfolk and Essex South
appeared to represent a consolidation of the anti-Tory vote. But Labour was
the real victor. The party gained every seat it could reasonably have hoped
for.
There was a 16 per cent swing to Labour in London, and the party forced
recounts in Thames Valley, the Conservatives fourth safest seat, Sussex
South and Crawley (9th), Kent East (11th safest), and Worcester and
Warwickshire South (19th). The Liberal Democrats forced recounts in Dorset
(24th), Hereford and Shropshire (21st) Devon and Plymouth W (30th).
The Scottish National party was on course to win Scotland North East, in
addition to the Highlands and Islands seat held since 1979 by Mrs Winnie
Ewing. Votes in both seats will be counted today. The SNP appeared to have
taken 31 per cent of the vote in Scotland, the party's best ever performance
in a UK-wide election. It was running second in a number of seats, including
Lothians and South of Scotland.
There was also good news for Plaid Cymru in North Wales, where Mr Dafydd
Wigley, the party leader, jumped into second place, raising the party's vote
from 13 per cent to 33 per cent. Plaid also took second place in mid-Wales,
but both seats were retained by Labour.
In South Wales East, Mrs Glenys Kinnock, wife of the former Labour leader,
was elected to the European parliament with a majority of more than 100,000.
Contrary to early forecasts that the turnout would collapse, 35 per cent of
the electorate turned out to vote, the same proportion that voted in 1989,
and 2 percentage points ahead of the turnout in 1984.
The Liberal Democrats appeared to have suffered from candidates standing for
the continuing Liberal party - composed of members who refused to join the
merger with the Social democrats.
'Other' candidates were taking around 11 per cent overall. The Green and UK
Independence parties seemed unlikely to win any seats, but the parties'
candidates came close in several seats to winning the 5 per cent of the vote
necessary to save their deposits.

FT  13 JUN 94 / European Elections: Major's reprieve is nothing to cheer
about
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major may have been granted a reprieve. But the prime minister and
his party have nothing to cheer. The voters of southern England are no
longer afraid of Labour.
It is a measure of the dramatic decline in the Tories' fortunes that Sir
Norman Fowler, the party chairman, could hail such results as an
achievement.
Before this summer the Conservatives had never scored below 30 per cent of
the vote in a nationwide poll. In the past two months it has done so twice -
first in the local polls and now in the European elections.
But the party started last night fearing even worse - that it would be
pushed into third place behind the Liberal Democrats and its representation
in the European parliament would be reduced to single figures. It did better
than that. Just.
To the extent one can judge the success of a brief election campaign, Mr
Major's decision to give a sceptical edge to his party's message was the
right one. On the doorstep, Tory candidates found that the voters held the
government in contempt. But there was no enthusiasm for Brussels.
There were other straws to clutch. Once again Labour's share of the vote
nationwide - estimated at 47 per cent - fell below its recent opinion poll
ratings of 50 per cent and more.
The Tories suffered from what the psephologists call differential turnout -
in other words many of their disgruntled supporters felt safe with the idea
of staying at home. Who after all cares about Europe? In a general election
many of these traditional Tories would return to the fold.
But Mr Major and his ministers should not kid themselves. This was an
extremely bad result, far worse than could be brushed off as the inevitable
protest by the electorate during a bout of mid-term blues.
It was bad not just because the Tory share of the vote was so low. Much more
importantly for the future shape of British politics was the fact that
Labour demonstrated for the first time since 1979 that it was capable of
winning votes and seats in southern England.
Look at some of the Euro-seats it has now won: Essex South, London South
East, and London North West. These are places where the Conservatives have
been entrenched for 15 years, where Labour barely existed a few years ago.
Since 1992 the voters in the south have punished the government by voting
Liberal Democrat. Mr Paddy Ashdown's party has claimed spectacular
by-election victories in Newbury, Christchurch and, most recently,
Eastleigh.
Last night it entrenched its position in its west country power base by
winning its first ever seats in the European parliament.
But for as long as the principal threat came from the Liberal Democrats,
Tory MPs could persuade themselves that it would be entirely possible to
rescue the position at a general election.
It is after all one of the great traditions of British politics that the
third party wins seats from the Conservatives during the lifetime of a
parliament and then hands them back at the following general election.
The picture has now changed. Labour is now the real challenger across a
swathe of southern England. It can win in places such as Norfolk, where
seven out of eight of the parliamentary seats are Tory-held.
John Smith's legacy has made itself felt. Mr Tony Blair, almost certain to
succeed him as Labour leader, is likely to be more, not less reassuring to
those among the middle- and skilled working classes who think Labour once
again is a party fit to vote for. There is not necessarily a correlation
between the results of a European election and the outcome of the subsequent
general election. But this time there might be.

FT  13 JUN 94 / European Elections: Beckett jubilant at string of victories
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Senior Labour politicians claimed last night that their European election
gains had exceeded the party's wildest expectations and amounted to a
crushing defeat for the Conservatives.
However, Tory party managers, while acknowledging that they had endured
heavy losses, were relieved that their party had not suffered the electoral
'meltdown' that was feared.
Instead, Labour and Tory politicians were quick to claim that the Liberal
Democrats had been the main losers on the night, amid signs that Mr Paddy
Ashdown's party would not gain many of its target seats.
Mrs Margaret Beckett, the acting Labour leader, described her party's gains
as 'absolutely wonderful'. Throughout the campaign, Labour had feared that
the party would find it hard to improve on its performance in the last
European elections. But, as a string of Labour victories was announced, Mrs
Beckett said that the Conservatives had been 'overtaken by a political
earthquake'.
She said of the Tory leadership: 'In 1989 they thought they were down to
their irreducible minimum, down to their core vote. Now we are eating into
that core vote.'
Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, said the Tories had endured their
worst result for 100 years. 'Labour has broken through in areas like Essex
and Norfolk which we haven't won since 1945 and 1966. The Conservative
government is living on borrowed time. The betrayals have now caught up with
them.'
Mrs Pauline Green, the leader of the Labour group in the European
parliament, said that Tory divisions over Europe had been the main reason
for the party's defeat. 'This election has been about the Europe people want
to see,' she said. 'The Tories are clearly riven top-to-bottom over Europe
while the Labour party is united in its approach.'
The mood at Conservative Central Office was gloomy, but tinged with relief
that the number of Tory seats would end up in double figures.
Sir Norman Fowler, the Conservative party chairman, regretted that his party
had lost so many seats, but said that it had performed much better than most
forecasters thought.
He went on to claim that yesterday's defeat could even be the low point in
the party's recent run of ill fortune. 'It marks what could be the start of
recovery as far as the Conservative party is concerned,' he said.
According to Mr David Hunt, the employment secretary, the party could still
make a comeback at the next election 'provided we listen to the message of
the voters in this election'.
However, some of the sitting Tory MEPs who lost their seats last night could
not refrain from criticising the government for helping to bring about their
defeats.
After losing his London North West seat, Lord Bethell, the longest-serving
English MEP to stand in the election, said that the Tory party 'should pull
its socks up'.
He said: 'There was a feeling amongst the people that they wanted to punish
the government, give it a kick, and I'm one of the victims.'
Mrs Teresa Gorman was one of a number of anti-European Tory MPs to claim
that the low turnout underlined that people wanted Britain to reduce its
commitments in Europe.
'Seventy per cent of the British people have turned their backs on Europe,
and that is the most important thing in this election,' she said.
The Liberal Democrats were initially jubilant at winning their first seat.
But Mrs Beckett claimed that the Liberal Democrats' performance showed they
were not a viable alternative to Labour as an opposition party.
'People are seeing right across Britain that if they want to get rid of this
government they have to go for a real alternative and that is Labour.'

FT  13 JUN 94 / European Elections: Labour finds way round the pickets -
Campaign Diary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour is unrepentant about barring party officials, MPs and candidates from
the BBC during the strike-hit election coverage on Thursday. The decision,
taken by acting leader Margaret Beckett, left BBC journalists trying to put
the Labour viewpoint during studio discussions.
A few made it on to the screens anyway - taking part in artificial press
conferences attended only by BBC journalists. 'OK, it was a device, but it
meant we didn't break the rules,' said an official.
                         *      *      *
Tony Blair's success in collecting the nominations of 136 Labour MPs caused
some confusion among the Sunday newspapers, which were unsure how many
Labour MPs there are, and how many sit in the shadow cabinet.
The papers split equally between 268 and 269 MPs, but The Observer plumped
for 21 shadow ministers, and The Independent for 19.
In fact, there are 270 Labour MPs, with one Labour-held seat vacant
following the death of John Smith. Two MPs - speaker Betty Boothroyd and
deputy speaker Geoffrey Lofthouse - do not vote on party matters, leaving
268 free to nominate candidates.
There are 18 elected members of the shadow cabinet, plus the leader and
deputy leader, the chief whip, the leader and chief whip in the Lords -
although neither peer has an automatic vote - and the party chairman if he
is not already a member. That makes a potential total of 24.
Since the leader's seat is vacant, and David Blunkett, the party chairman,
sits as an elected member, the correct total is 22. But it falls to 20 if
the two peers are excluded, or 19 if you exclude Blunkett, who has said he
will take no part in the election to protect the neutrality of the chair.
Why is nothing ever easy in the Labour party?
Alec Kellaway, the Newham Liberal Democrat candidate who defected to Labour
a day before last week's by-election, will forever be known at Westminster
as Which Way Kellaway. But he has also made a lasting contribution to the
political argot: Kellaway - one who flits from from party to party, usually
embarrassing both.
                         *      *      *
Lots of politicians have problems with grammar. Margaret Thatcher, who had a
habit of omitting definite and indefinite articles, was a particular
offender. But John Prescott takes the biscuit, as anyone who heard his
virtually incomprehensible speech on voting systems at last year's Labour
conference will know.
Reporters usually clean up Prescott's prose, as they did Thatcher's. But as
the Labour leadership campaign gets under way, here is a sample of unedited
Prescott talking during a BBC interview yesterday about the Beveridge
Commission's 1944 definition of full employment as an unemployment rate of
2.5 per cent of the workforce: 'Two and a half million is the level that is
set by the government on claimants. There is something like about 4 to 5m
people available for work according to the ILO in Britain. Because we fiddle
the figures we don't know. So if you ask me about the 2 1/2 per cent, 2 1/2
per cent of 2 1/2 m is a different kind of definition to that of 4 or 5m.'
I don't know what it means either. Prescott added: 'There is no intelligent
debate about these matters. I want to re-introduce intelligent debate.'
                         *      *      *
The City seems unsure whether to take the European elections seriously. Some
currency and bond dealers remember with trepidation the millions of pounds
made and lost after the Danish 'No' to the Maastricht treaty in June 1992,
and the narrow French 'Yes' a few months later.
Steve Hannah, head of research at Japanese investment bank IBJ
International, points to the increased power of the European parliament, the
implications of a poor showing for interest rates and the Tory leadership.
But others think the City will greet the results with a yawn. David Cocker,
chief economist at Chemical Bank, said: 'The apathetic attitude of the
British electorate is likely to be reflected in the apathetic response of
the markets.'

FT  13 JUN 94 / European Elections: Computer leaves Ashdown smiling through
gritted teeth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At the Liberal Democrats' Westminster headquarters in Cowley Street a huge
crowd of mainly young party activists had gathered from early yesterday
evening for what they expected would be a celebration over bottles of wine
and Coca-Cola.
But as the evening wore on - showing the party failing to make the big gains
in the south that some opinion polls had predicted - the mood became more
subdued.
The switch from euphoria to silence had its most dramatic and poignant
moment just after midnight. The live television coverage reported a Liberal
Democrat gain in Surrey. A huge cheer broke out and Mr Paddy Ashdown and his
campaign manager Mr Matthew Taylor embraced in front of the cameras.
Then while Mr Ashdown was in full flow, expressing his delight at the result
and predicting the beginning of the end of a long struggle to wrench control
of the south from the Conservative party, the television commentator
corrected the result to a Conservative win, and apologised for a computer
error.
With that announcement Cowley Street fell temporarily silent and Mr Ashdown,
visibly shaken, walked from the room, leaving Mr Taylor to rationalise the
result.
Mr Taylor blamed Labour for allowing Mr Major to do better than expected
against the Liberal Democrats. 'What we are seeing is the Labour party doing
well enough in the south and south-west at our expense and making it
possible for the Conservatives to hang on. John Major may well end up
thanking the Labour party for allowing him to hang on to his job for another
term and saving his bacon.'
By 12.45am some spirits at Liberal Democrat headquarters were again elated
by the news that after their second gain there were two further seats where
recounts were taking place.
Mr Ashdown was back in front of the television cameras wearing a huge grin.
He predicted that the party would still emerge from the night better than
anyone could have predicted a year ago. Even after the earlier
disappointment of Surrey, Liberal Democrat activists took heart from the
election of their first Euro MP. One party worker, Mr David Charlesworth,
said: 'For us to get even one Euro MP is a breakthrough. Any more will be
the cream on top of the cake.' Another worker, Mr David Cloke, said: 'Any
gain is good news for us and we'll be happy if we end up with two.'

FT  13 JUN 94 / European Elections: Confusion over candidates in Devon and
East Plymouth
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A Literal Democrat candidate polled 10,000 votes in the Devon and East
Plymouth constituency, which the Liberal Democrats had hoped to win.
The Liberal Democrats had regarded the Literal Democrat candidature as a
spoiling action. The party protested and went to the High Court, but was
told that a challenge would result in a delayed election. The party decided
that could be counter-productive.
On polling day, the Liberal Democrat HQ received many telephone calls from
confused voters. Candidates are listed on the ballot paper in alphabetical
order and the party's candidate, Mr Adrian Sanders, came at the bottom.
Above him on the ballot paper were the Literal Democrat candidate and a
Liberal candidate. Some callers said they realised they had voted for the
wrong candidate by mistake.

FT  13 JUN 94 / European Elections: Lib Dem wins fail to live up to party's
private hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Liberal Democrats showed delight last night at winning their first seats
in the European parliament. But they failed to make as many gains in the
south and south-west as they had privately hoped.
The party had sought to play down media predictions, based on opinion polls,
that they could win a swathe of Tory-held seats in the south-west and south.
It did achieve victory in its two prime targets, Somerset and North Devon,
where it had a majority of 22,000 over the Conservatives, and Cornwall and
West Plymouth, with a majority of 29,000.
'It is the breakthrough we have been looking forward to for a very long
time,' said Mr Paddy Ashdown, the party leader, speaking in his constituency
of Yeovil in Somerset.
While it was a breakthrough for the party into the European parliament, it
did not presage a break-out from south-west England, where his party has had
sweeping gains in council elections. Although the party benefited from a
sharp fall in the share of the Green vote, compared with 1989, Liberal
Democrats spoke last night of votes for Labour having saved Mr John Major's
bacon.
An early disappointment for the Liberal Democrats came when they failed to
win Wight and Hampshire South, where the Tories had a majority of 5,000.
They also failed to capture Hampshire North and Oxford. Although these seats
were not their best targets, their hopes had been boosted by their
parliamentary by-election at Eastleigh in Hampshire on Thursday.
A further disappointment for the Liberal Democrats came with the failure to
win the North Wiltshire and Bath seat. Because boundary changes had brought
into the constituency the city of Bath, where the party won the
parliamentary seat in 1992 and controls the council, it believed it had a
chance to win.
Another outside chance was the Cotswolds seat, held by Lord Plumb for the
Tories. There the party was pushed into third place by Labour, which in a
strong performance slashed Lord Plumb's majority to 4,000.
In Cornwall and West Plymouth, Mr Robin Teverson, the Liberal Democrat
candidate, defeated Mr Christopher Beazley, who had held the seat for the
Conservatives for 10 years and had a majority of nearly 20,000 in 1989.
In Somerset and North Devon, the Liberal Democrats only managed fourth place
behind the Greens and Labour in 1989. Since then, they have won control of
the county council and, in this election, were helped by boundary changes.
After an active campaign, the turnout was 47 per cent, 7 per cent up on the
previous election. Labour, in third place, saw its share of the poll fall
slightly and the Greens' vote, as expected, dropped sharply.
Mr Graham Watson, the new MEP for Somerset and North Devon, said: 'There is
a tide of liberalism sweeping the west country. It has not yet reached its
peak, and I believe it will sweep this current government from office.'
He added: 'I have found that on this constituency it has been fought largely
on European issues. I've certainly been asked many times about my policies
on the social chapter, and things like this, and I think the public have
rejected what the Tories are doing in Europe.'
The defeated Tory, Mrs Margaret Daly, had held the seat for 10 years with a
majority of 40,000 in 1989. She said many people had told her they would
vote Liberal Democrat as a protest. But she added: 'I hope the prime
minister sticks to his guns. I think the thing the Conservative party wants
like a hole in the head is a leadership challenge.'
Sir Robert Wall, head of the Conservative group on Bristol city council,
said: 'I can't see what advantage there would be in changing the leader.'

FT  13 JUN 94 / European Elections: Tension to the end for headmaster
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The swing to Labour in London North West, a seat the party should have won
easily, was less than 3 per cent. The party's candidate, Mr Robert Evans, a
local headmaster, was tense right up to the count.
He paced up and down the vast gym at the Harrow leisure centre where the
count for the was being held, and said: 'I am cautiously optimistic.'
It was only towards midnight, when the boxes piled up on the right of the
table clearly showed that Mr Evans had made it, that he began to relax.
Lord Bethell, the longest-serving English MEP to stand in the election,
blamed mid-term blues for the loss of the seat.
'There was a feeling amongst the people that they wanted to punish the
government, give it a kick, and I'm one of the victims.'

FT  13 JUN 94 / European Elections: Champagne corks pop in Walworth Rd
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There was elation at Labour's headquarters in London's Walworth Road early
this morning. Volunteers uncorked champagne bottles as they analysed the
results.
Mr Larry Whitty, general secretary, said the results showed Labour doing
'substantially better than any of us expected'. Mr Whitty revealed that the
party's eve-of-poll internal soundings had been showing Labour gaining a
maximum of 50 to 55 seats. By early morning it was looking as if the party
would go beyond 60.
Mr Whitty had more than that to celebrate. He pointed to Labour victories
right across the country, a virtual 'wipeout' of the Tory vote in London -
and perhaps the most applauded result in the headquarters all evening - the
capture of Essex Man deep in the Tory heartlands.
Among those milling around Walworth Road was the shadow secretary to the
Treasury, Ms Harriet Harman, anxious to make sure that her comments for the
evening would be overheard by the Financial Times: 'What the people of Essex
have said is that they don't believe that the Tories represent the party of
low tax any more. Now Essex Man and Woman have turned to Labour.'
Among the many results striking a particularly poignant note for the
gathered party activists was the election of Mr Neil Kinnock's wife Glenys
as a Euro MP. Her celebration speech was a striking contrast to the Glenys
Kinnock who stood outside the same building during the last general election
tearfully recording the national humiliation of her husband.
It was left to Mr Frank Dobson, transport spokesman, to contribute his joke
for the evening amidst the euphoria. Gleefully watching the Conservative
rout on the television, Mr Dobson said: 'It is a real record-breaking night
for John Major. In fact it is like Brian Lara in reverse - he is breaking so
many records.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Monday: A busy week for UK economic statistics kicks off with May producer
prices. Annual rates of growth have been subdued but there were signs in
April that the surge in world commodity prices was showing up in
manufacturers' costs.
Tuesday: The Confederation of British Industry's distributive trades survey
will give the week's first clue to the strength of the retail sector in May.
Analysts will be looking to see if April's tax rises have affected consumer
behaviour.
Wednesday: A cornucopia of economic information. Inflation in May is
expected to be subdued, with the underlying annual rate stuck at 2.3 per
cent and the headline rate set to fall slighly to 2.5 per cent. Analysts
think unemployment will fall by a further 25,000 in May. But a key focus for
the markets will be average earnings, the annual growth rate of which has
recently accelerated from 3 to 4 per cent.
Thursday: Official retail sales figures for May are expected to show a small
increase in the annual rate of growth, from 4.4 to 4.5 per cent. May's
public sector borrowing requirement is forecast to have been Pounds 4.1bn.

MONDAY Euro-election results
Governments and voters throughout Europe digest the results of the weekend
elections for the 567-member European parliament and the referendum on EU
membership in Austria.
The big question now for the Strasbourg political groupings is whether the
parliament's increased powers can be translated into positive action - to
improve parliamentary supervision of the Commission and Council of
Ministers, and to increase the cohesiveness of legislation affecting the
269m-strong EU electorate.
OAU: the Organisation of African Unity holds its annual summit in Tunis (to
June 15). South Africa will participate for the first time.
Bankers meeting: World central bankers assemble in Basle, Switzerland, for
the annual meeting of the Bank of International Settlements. Topics for
discussion include the recent turmoil in the bond markets; the growth of
derivatives trading and the potential need for regulation; and the explosion
in cross-border capital flows.
Counties review: Today is 'Big Bang' in the local government review of
England. The Local Government Commission, chaired by Sir John Banham,
announces plans to restructure five counties, in which the local authorities
strongly disagree - Cambridgeshire, Cheshire, Cumbria, Kent and Oxfordshire.
Hampshire, Lancashire and Berkshire (where the local councils, unusually,
agree) follow tomorrow, with Buckinghamshire on Wednesday and Bedfordshire
on Friday.
Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko of Japan are in Washington (to June 25).
Today they attend a White House dinner hosted by President Clinton.
Korean crisis: A small group of opposition Japanese MPs leaves for North
Korea in an effort to find a solution to the nuclear row. Former US
president Jimmy Carter is also in North Korea this week.
Orly flights: British Airways is to introduce four daily round trip services
from London's Heathrow airport to Orly in Paris following the French
government's decision to open up the Parisian airport to more competition.
Opec oil ministers hold mid-year conference in Vienna on pricing and
production strategy.
Acid rain: Environment ministers from Europe and North America are expected
to sign a deal cutting emissions of sulphur dioxide, a main component of
acid rain (to June 14).
Cartagena: Ibero-American heads of state meet in Colombia to discuss
integration and co-operation.

Holidays: Australia, Hong Kong, Portugal (Lisbon only). Taiwan.
14 TUESDAY BCCI verdicts due
Court verdicts on 13 former senior executives of the collapsed Bank of
Credit and Commerce International who were tried in Abu Dhabi are expected
today. Charges include dissipating funds, forging documents, concealing
deficits and approving false loans.
One of those accused, Mr Swaleh Naqvi, BCCI's former chief executive, was
last month extradited to the US. If found guilty, Mr Naqvi would be returned
to Abu Dhabi but only after standing trial in the US and serving any
sentence received there.
EU foreign ministers conclude a two-day meeting in Luxembourg to prepare for
the European summit in Corfu on June 24-25. The EU may finally wrap up a
political and trade agreement with Russia, so that President Boris Yeltsin
can attend a high-profile signing ceremony in Corfu.
Meantime, President Leonid Kravchuk of Ukraine is due in Luxembourg today to
sign an accord with the EU promising closer economic and political ties.
Ukraine will be the first ex-Soviet state to form an official relationship
with the EU. The accord opens the door for Ukraine to join the European free
trade area as early as 1998.
Royal Ascot starts today with the St James's Palace Stakes, which promises
to be the highlight of the meeting. The racing continues until Friday, with
Ladies Day on Thursday.
DGB meeting: Germany's Trade Union Federation, the DGB, under which the
country's 16 industrial trade unions are grouped, starts a special three-day
congress to elect a successor to Mr Heinz-Werner Meyer who died last month.
The congress will be attended by Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
Also today, Romania's leading trade unions hold a mass rally in Bucharest to
protest against low pay and the government's failure to stem the country's
four-year recession.
Transport: EU transport ministers finish a two-day meeting in Luxembourg.
They are expected to endorse an action programme to consolidate deregulation
of Europe's airline industry. But controversy could arise over the French
government's plan to inject FFr20bn (USDollars 3.5bn) into Air France.
Westminster: MPs return to Parliament after Whitsun recess. Prime minister's
question time is likely to be dominated by the European election.
FT Survey: Nottinghamshire: Regeneration of the Coalfields.
Holidays: Hong Kong.
15 WEDNESDAY Clarke speaks to City
Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor (left), gives the annual 'Mansion House'
speech to the City of London. Traditionally an occasion for expounding
monetary policy, it is expected that Mr Clarke will also cover broader
issues such as education and training in describing how the government plans
to nurture economic recovery without reigniting inflation.
Finnish no-confidence vote:
Prime Minister Esko Aho's centre-right coalition faces a parliamentary vote
of no confidence amidst squabbling within the government over the country's
intention to join the European Union on January 1 next year.
Hosokawa loan: Masatoshi Miyama, the ex-secretary of former prime minister
Morihiro Hosokawa, is to testify in Japan's lower house on Y100m (Pounds
636,900) which Hosokawa borrowed from a scandal-tainted trucking company and
allegedly used for a personal political campaign.
Also in Tokyo this week, first-quarter GDP figures will be announced.
Cambodia's Khmer Rouge guerrilla faction is sending six senior officials to
peace talks starting today in Phnom Penh. The group's nominal leader, Khieu
Samphan, will not attend.
City elections: Smithfield meat market traders have been exploiting a
medieval electoral system in their dispute with the Corporation of London
over market rents. The traders have tried to pack the electoral rolls with
their supporters ahead of the Corporation's elections due in December. Today
is the final day for registration.
Nuclear plants: A conference of the International Atomic Energy Agency in
Vienna this week aims to set international safety standards for land-based
civil nuclear power plants (to June 17).
Queen Margrethe of Denmark visits Iceland (to June 19).
Rail strike:
Britain's railway network is threatened with a shut-down today when
signalmen are expected to strike in support of an 11 per cent pay claim.
FT Survey: Telecommunications in Business.
16 THURSDAY
Labour trio share platform
As nominations close for the Labour leadership contest, candidates Tony
Blair, John Prescott and Margaret Beckett, will today take part in a debate
sponsored by the Transport and General Workers Union. The debate rounds off
a busy week for the trio which starts with each of them addressing the GMB
general union conference on Monday in Blackpool.
Bosnia: Senior officials from the 'contact' group, comprising the US,
Russia, the European Union and the United Nations, are expected to meet in
London today to discuss moves towards a broad political settlement in the
former Yugoslavia. Last week the warring parties agreed a month-long truce,
which may create the conditions for negotiations on territorial division.
The contact group had earlier proposed a four-month ceasefire.
Also today, leaders of the warring Bosnian factions are due to meet in
Sarajevo for talks with UN special envoy Yasushi Akashi and General Sir
Michael Rose, the UN commander in Bosnia.
Berlusconi in Bonn: Italian premier Silvio Berlusconi meets Chancellor
Helmut Kohl in Bonn in his first top level European diplomatic meeting since
assuming office a month ago. Italy has been traditionally close to Germany
but the new Italian government is wary of a strong Franco- German axis.
Top of the agenda will be the forthcoming EU summit in Corfu (including the
question of who will be the next European Commission president), and the
German EU presidency.
Single market: EU ministers meet in Luxembourg today to review the progress
of the single market, 18 months since its inception. On the agenda will be
proposals for a new system of administrative co-operation between member
states, which should allow faster problem-solving related to the free
circulation of goods.
Gatt director general, Peter Sutherland, delivers the third annual Hayek
Memorial Lecture in London.
Dalai Lama visits Rome (to June 17).
Fine wine: One of the finest private wine cellars to come on the market is
to be sold at Christie's in London today. Some 18,000 bottles from the
world's greatest wine estates, which have been assembled over 30 years by a
private collector, are expected to fetch more than Pounds 1m.
Golf: US Open championship in Oakmont, Pennsylvania (to June 19).
Cricket: England play New Zealand in second test at Lords (to June 20).
17 FRIDAY
Scandinavia debates EU
Finland's Centre party, Norway's governing Labour party and Sweden's
opposition Social Democratic party open special party conferences called to
decide official party policy towards membership of the European Union.
Support from all three is seen as vital to winning a Yes vote in referendums
due in their respective countries in October and November, but each is
deeply split on the issue.
The pro-EU leaderships of the three are expected to prevail, but not without
agonised debate.
Aids researchers, representatives from international organisations and more
than 40 health ministers meet in Paris today. They are preparing for a
summit conference in the French capital in December when government heads
will discuss new ways to fight the disease (to June 18).
Soccer: The World Cup starts today with Germany playing Bolivia, and Spain
taking on South Korea. During the next four weeks, nine US cities will host
52 matches played by 24 national teams across four time zones.
FT Guide: World Cup Football.
18-19 WEEKEND Colombia votes again
A close finish is expected in the second round of Colombia's presidential
elections on Sunday. Liberal Party candidate Ernesto Samper had an advantage
of only 0.3 per cent over Conservative Andres Pastrana in the first round on
May 29.
Voter abstention in the first round reached 66 per cent, and is expected to
be worse on Sunday because of the soccer World Cup.
Berlin parade: Allied forces hold a farewell parade on Saturday in Berlin.
US, British and French troops will march close to the Brandenburg Gate,
which divided the city until November 1989. Russian troops have been
excluded by the city authorities.

politicians with their most serious test since last autumn's parliamentary
elections. Poles will be voting nationwide for 52,173 councillors.
Le Mans: 24 hour race on Saturday.
Holidays: Bahrain (Saturday).

FT  13 JUN 94 / Analysts fear fresh bout of turbulence - New York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street has been very quiet over the past month, perhaps a little too
quiet. The even tempo of trading may have come as a relief after this
spring's impassioned sell-off. But with the period of relative restraint and
stability now extending into its fourth week, some analysts fear the market
is poised for a fresh bout of turbulence.
'The longer volume stays low, and the longer the market just inches along,
the better the odds of an exaggerated move,' says Mr Gregory Nie, technical
analyst at Kemper Securities in Chicago.
Since the immediate reaction to the Federal Reserve's fourth move to higher
interest rates in mid-May petered out, the bear market has seemed more like
a snail market.
Excluding last week's closing session, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average
gained 20 points, the blue-chip index has shifted 10 points higher or lower
only four times since May 23.
In most sessions, the Dow has stalled within a point or two of its opening
level. For the most part, activity has remained sluggish.
Even last Friday, trading was restricted to 222m shares. However, investors
may look back on the session as a turning point of sorts. This week, the
potential for faster-paced activity and sharp price movements looms larger.
First, political instability is a wild card which could come into play, with
the US attempting to formulate a response to North Korea's intransigence
over nuclear inspections. US trade talks with Japan, and their impact on the
dollar's value against the yen, also represent a threat to confidence.
The issue of market timing will also re-emerge this week. On Friday, Wall
Street faces the 'triple-witching' expiration of futures and options on
stock indices, and options on individual issues. The consequent unwinding of
investment positions is sure to exaggerate any underlying trend, especially
in view of the thin level of trading recently. 'The risks for speculators is
going to go up a notch,' says Mr Nie.
This week also marks the beginning of the quarterly 'window-dressing'
period, when activity traditionally accelerates. As the month draws to an
end, portfolio managers will either add to their winning positions, or
unload their losers, in the hope of casting their second-quarter
performances in the most favourable light.
Mr Nie is one of several analysts who believe most windows will be undressed
in the final days of June, setting the stage for a big downturn.
A brief spurt higher is certainly possible this week. The Kemper analyst
points out that cash reserves remain low, even though stocks have now moved
into a 'oversold' position. As a result, the market 'feels like it wants to
move up'.
'But somewhere in here we are going to get a selling wave,' Mr Nie argues,
pointing out that a hefty decline would help build up cash reserves. 'Until
that issue is addressed, I have a hard time believing that we are going to
get a sustained rally.'

FT  13 JUN 94 / Equity Markets: Search is on for a better way to evaluate
exposure - Risk and Reward
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The current debate over the dangers inherent in the derivatives market has
led to a more detailed analysis of the different types of risk involved, and
greater attention to the best way to quantify risk.
Traditionally, the growth of the over-the-counter derivatives market has
been tracked according to the notional principal amount of swaps outstanding
 -that is, the notional amount on which payments under each swap agreement
are calculated. The notional amount, in most swap agreements, is not
actually exchanged.
However, many derivatives dealers have argued, not surprisingly, that while
this measure of derivatives volume may reflect the size of the market, it
does not reflect the amount of risk involved. Instead, they argue, it makes
more sense to measure the replacement values of swaps transactions, which
reflects the current credit exposures of outstanding derivatives
transactions.
Such a measure has much in its favour. First, because dealers manage risk by
marking the value of transactions 'to market' - up or down in line with
market fluctuations, a measure of current replacement value is more in
keeping with market practice. Second, the measure reflects credit risk, one
of the main types of risk identified by bankers and regulators as a source
of concern in the derivatives market. It can then be more reasonably
compared with credit risk in other markets.
'Modern risk management allows us to disaggregate and isolate different
elements of risk, against which one can set appropriate amounts of capital
internally,' said Ms Gay Evans, chairman of the International Swaps and
Derivatives Association (ISDA).
To prove the point, ISDA, the OTC derivatives trade association, last week
announced the results of a pilot survey on derivatives replacement values.
The survey of 14 leading dealers around the world found that the gross
replacement value of swaps outstanding at the end of 1993 was Dollars
178.4bn, or 2.15 per cent of their notional amount of Dollars 7,600bn.
However, the net replacement value - once all agreements between individual
counterparties have been netted off - is even lower at Dollars 101.3bn or
1.22 per cent of their notional amount.
The smaller figure assumes netting is legally enforceable, which remains
unclear in some jurisdictions. However, the Basle Committee of central
bankers is believed to be close to making a fresh statement on the issue.
In future, ISDA will conduct a survey of net replacement value alongside its
regular survey of notional principal amounts. Its most recent survey of the
notional principal amounts, for the end of 1992, produced an estimate of
Dollars 4,500bn. The latest survey of just 14 participants, showing their
notional amount at Dollars 7.6bn at the end of 1993, suggests the market's
expansion has accelerated still further.
The survey also showed that the credit exposure of participating firms in
derivatives was significantly less than in other activities. For example,
the 10 banks and two of the four broker-dealer affiliates surveyed held net
loans and letters of credit totalling Dollars 1,686bn, and the 14 firms had
a total of Dollars 442bn of securities in investment or trading accounts -
compared with net replacement value, or credit risk, of just over Dollars
100bn.
The move away from notional amounts was recognised in the recent report by
the US General Accounting Office. In its own survey of 14 US participants,
the notional amount at the end of 1992 was Dollars 6,500bn, with gross
credit risk of only Dollars 114bn and net credit risk of Dollars 68bn - much
smaller than for loans.

FT  13 JUN 94 / Equity Markets: A whiff of short-term optimism - London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The division between optimists and pessimists among UK stock market analysts
is now more sharply divided than before. On the one hand, the FT-SE 100
index starts the week solidly above the 3,000 mark which has tormented the
chartists since the middle of last month. On the other, the bond markets
retain their capacity to rattle equities and reverse stock market trends
within minutes.
For those strategists focusing on the strength of underlying equity
valuations and on the evidence of economic recovery in the UK, last week
brought valuable support in the powerful rise in UK industrial output
reported for April. The 1.6 per cent monthly gain was well above
expectations and put teeth into those equity market valuations which stand
accused of over-valuation.
Strauss Turnbull believes the recent business recession brought sharper
falls in earnings than in the past, and the way is now open for earnings
growth of 40 per cent in the next two years without generating the high
inflation which lies at the heart of the bond market's worries.
The most significant response to the industrial output data may prove to be
the emergence of signs that equities have at least begun to shake off the
influence of the gilt-edged market. Although gilts continued to unsettle
shares within a narrow range, they did not seriously hinder the near 2 per
cent recovery in the FT-SE index.
Indeed, base rate fears are not what they were. S. G. Warburg has upgraded
its base rate forecasts in the light of last week's economic data, and now
looks for a rise of a full point to 6.25 per cent by this time next year.
However, such expectations, once alarming, now ring no tocsins in the City
of London, or at least not in the stock market, which has decided to live
with them.
The prime minster also did his best for the market by assuring newspaper
readers that 'dividend control is a non-starter,' even if he did leave
obscure the wider question of dividend taxation, which is the market's real
worry.
The government's political problems, including the by-elections and the
European elections, have all been so widely rehearsed in the financial
markets that it is difficult to see what further damage can follow.
The economic side of the optimistic argument will be well tested this week.
If the Footsie continues to progress against a backcloth of statistics on
producer and retail prices, the retail price index and other data, then 'the
equity market will have more room to manoeuvre,' as Mr Richard Jeffrey of
Charterhouse Tilney puts it.
But those still unwilling to take such a positive view will want to see more
evidence that equities have indeed shaken off bond market influence - it was
still gilts leading equities ahead at the end of the week. Prominent among
them is Mr Nicholas Knight of Nomura Research, the noted bear of the London
market, who was reported to be cutting his mid-year forecast for the Footsie
Index. This week could be the week to watch.

AMSTERDAM
Trading in KPN, the Dutch telecommunications and postal company, begins on
the stock exchange today. Allocation of the shares was determined over the
weekend after strong demand for domestic and foreign investors resulted in
applications for about 390m shares, compared with the 138.15m on offer.
Ahold reports first-quarter figures on Thursday. The food retailer has
already forecast an improvement in first-quarter net profits compared with
last year's result, after figures last month showed that sales, excluding
value added tax, rose by 8 per cent in the first 16 weeks of the year.
MILAN
Ifil, the Agnelli family holding company, launches its complicated capital
increase on Thursday, the start of the July trading account, which aims to
bring in a total of about L802bn.
Friday brings the close of the institutional offering for shares in Finanza
&amp; Futuro, one of Italy's leading mutual fund management groups. About 24m
shares are being sold by Cofide, the holding company of Mr Carlo De
Benedetti, which is seeking to raise Dollars 100m through the sale.
STOCKHOLM
Six-month figures come from Hennes &amp; Mauritz on Thursday. UBS, which expects
a 40 per cent increase in net profit, notes that the retailer has already
indicated that first-quarter sales were 20 per cent ahead of the previous
year and that profits also grew strongly.
HELSINKI
The busy results schedule continues this week with four-month figures today
from Kemira and Kone. Metra, Rautaruukki and Valmet report tomorrow,
Metsa-Serla and Skopbank on Wednesday, while Nokia, Finvest, and Okobank
announce figures on Thursday.
TOKYO
Investors are expected to make a more measured response to Friday's tankan
survey of business confidence from the Bank of Japan. The immediate response
to the report, which while positive was not as strong as some had expected,
left shares off the two-year highs seen on Wednesday and Thursday. Investors
will also be awaiting first-quarter GDP figures, due on Thursday.

The tentative optimism evident in the bund market towards the end of last
week may be sustained in the next few days.
'The tone to the market is much better than it has been for weeks now,'
Yamaichi International says. 'With yields close to 7 per cent and in a
noticeably more stable environment, institutional domestic investors are
beginning to return.'
Investors are likely to focus on the Bundesbank's repurchase agreement on
Wednesday. The 'repo' rate has dropped by 25 basis points since the last
discount rate cut and now stands at 5.10 per cent. If the repo continues to
fall at 5 basis points a week, the stage may well be set for another cut in
the discount rate as early as July.
This could counteract the pessimism among investors about the direction of
German monetary policy.
'The likelihood is still that the Bundesbank drags its heels on the repo to
avoid being boxed into a discount rate cut, but the prospects of a pleasant
surprise in July are clearly improving,' says Ms Allison Cottrell at Midland
Global Markets.
On the other hand, the European parliamentary elections could dampen
investor interest in bunds if the results suggest a poor outcome for
Chancellor Helmut Kohl and his ruling coalition in the national elections
later this year.

Japanese government bond prices soared following Friday's release of the
tankan quarterly survey of business sentiment. The benchmark 10-year bond
yield fell to 4.130 per cent, 10 basis points below the previous Friday's
close.
On Friday morning, before the release of the tankan, bond prices fell on the
belief that the report would paint a bright picture that would rule out
interest rates falling much lower. But when the report, released that
afternoon, showed that business expectations were improved but still weak,
dealers swung back on the buy side, sending bond prices higher to the close.
Bonds started the week with prices continuing to slide, following the
previous week's falls in world markets. On Tuesday, Mr Masaru Hayami, who
heads the Japan Association of Corporate Executives, said the economy would
improve by autumn without any need for fiscal measures. This triggered an
avalanche of selling, but on Wednesday, a rise in the yen triggered by US
threats of trade sanctions caused bonds to rebound after eight days of
declines.
The market's renewed strength is tempered by the increasingly worrisome
North Korea nuclear stalemate. On Thursday, prices fell on reports that the
North had been testing a 1,000km range missile, but regained ground near the
close.

There will be plenty of information for the gilts market to get its teeth
into this week, with the normal mid-month flurry of economic statistics.
While the retail prices index and the unemployment numbers represent the
'heavyweight' economic figures, the gilts market may be even more interested
in the average earnings number. The relentless rise in the underlying annual
rate of growth, to 4 per cent from 3 per cent, has been seen as a precursor
of future inflationary pressures.
'The market will want to see at least an unchanged annual average earnings
rate,' says Mr Sanjay Joshi, head of bond research at Daiwa Europe. 'The
worst-case scenario would be a movement up to 4 1/4 per cent.'
The chancellor of the exchequer's Mansion House speech is a chance for Mr
Kenneth Clarke to reassure the markets about the government's economic
policies. He has previously appeared much more willing to cut interest rates
than the governor of the Bank of England. 'What the market will not want to
see is an open dispute between the chancellor and Eddie George,' says Mr
Joshi.
Nevertheless, UK economic fundamentals have not always been the primary
factor in determining the direction of gilts in recent weeks.

FT  13 JUN 94 / World Bond Markets: End of the bloodletting in emerging
markets - Capital and Credit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The bloodletting in emerging bond markets has finally stopped, but it may
take some time before investors regain some of the confidence that pushed
prices to dizzying heights last year.
Although cautious investor buying in recent weeks has bolstered prices and
helped yield spreads over US Treasuries tighten, observers warn that the
markets remain vulnerable to further upward lurches in US interest rates and
political surprises. This may keep a lid on activity, both in the new issues
sector and the secondary market.
'Given the political uncertainties, and the unfavourable recent capital
market developments, I would not be surprised to see a slowdown in
investments in the region this year,' Mr Onno van den Broek, general manager
at ING Bank, said at an emerging markets conference in London last week.
After a raging bull-run pushed emerging market bonds sharply higher in 1993,
a dramatic turnround, triggered by the Federal Reserve's tightening and
political and economic shocks in Latin America, sent prices into free-fall.
JP Morgan's emerging markets bond index posted a total return of 44.17 per
cent in 1993, before falling by as much as 22 per cent to its low on April
4. Since then it has recovered slightly, but is still down 13.3 per cent in
the year to date.
Since the correction, 'people have become more risk-averse - investors are
gaining a bit of confidence, but the market will be slow to regain its
composure,' says Mr Brian Lazell of JP Morgan in London.
However, he and others say they have seen new investors entering the market.
'All the large customers who were in the market in the third quarter of 1993
are still invested, and there have been new investors coming in.' says Mr
Stephen Dizard of Salomon Brothers in New York.
'We've seen new people enter the market who felt it was oversold and saw
this as a buying opportunity,' echoes Mr Lawrence Brainard of Chase
Securities in New York.
However, 'the threat of higher US interest rates is still overhanging the
market,' warns Mr Peter West of West Merchant Bank in London, although he
says 'there may be room for further recovery' if the yield on the US long
bond continues trading in a 7.2 to 7.5 per cent range.
Latin American elections will also keep investors on their toes. While
Mexico's PRI party is expected to remain in government after the August
elections, the outcome of Brazil's elections in October is less clear-cut,
with leftist opposition candidate Mr Luis Inacio Lula da Silva currently
leading in the opinion polls.
'Emerging markets are macro-driven, which makes them very sensitive to
politics,' says Salomon's Mr Dizard. 'You can expect to see a lot of
volatility out of Latin America this year.'
But this should not daunt fund managers, he says. 'They just have to manage
their portfolios actively and may want to avoid exposure to certain markets
at certain times. There is enough value in fundamentally sound countries
such as Argentina and Mexico - you don't have to make dicey calls. But
having some exposure to markets like Brazil and Venezuela can help boost
performance.'
Amid this uncertainty, new issuance in the eurobond market has slowed to a
trickle, leaving an estimated Dollars 2bn - Dollars 3bn of new issue
mandates piling up in underwriters' desk drawers as borrowers await more
favourable conditions.
In the year to date, Latin American borrowers have raised the equivalent of
Dollars 7.6bn in eurobonds, compared with last year's Dollars 25.3bn total,
according to IFR Securities Data. ,
Eurobond yield spreads over the underlying government bonds widened sharply
during the sell-off, making emerging market borrowers more reluctant to tap
the market. 'For any size, deals will have to err on the generous side, and
that's holding issuers back,' said a syndicate official in London.
Still, several Argentinian borrowers are expected to emerge soon, including
the Province of Buenos Aires, Sodigas and Banco del Sud. The Republic of
Argentina is expected to raise between DM400m and DM500m in short-dated
bonds this week.
Elsewhere, the government-owned Industrial Development Bank of India is
poised to issue the first straight eurobond by an Indian borrower in four
years. Market talk is of Dollars 100m of five-year floating-rate notes with
a put option after three years, rumoured to be led by JP Morgan.
One syndicate manager says he hopes eurobond investors 'learnt an important
lesson' from the recent carnage, namely that they should pay more attention
to credit considerations and fundamental factors, and less to the high
returns some bonds may offer.
Moreover, he says, they should ensure that the lead managers of new issues
are committed to making a liquid secondary market in the paper. Lastly, he
said 'issuers and underwriters need to have a responsible attitude to ensure
issues are appropriately priced, get placed and don't weigh on the market'.

US credit markets face a heavy flow of economic statistics this week, which
could unsettle a market which has already lost the momentum from a two-week
rally.
The benchmark 30-year Treasury issue fell  3/8 on Friday, with its yield
dropping to 7.31 per cent from 7.27 per cent after the release of May
producer prices figures.
These showed a drop of 0.1 per cent, but this was due to large falls in
volatile food and energy prices. The core rate of inflation rose by a larger
than expected 0.4 per cent, raising concern that inflation is gathering
speed, and that this will prompt the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary
policy again.
The market's more cautious tone will be tested tomorrow with the release of
May's consumer price index. Analysts are forecasting an increase of 0.3 per
cent, compared with a 0.1 per cent rise in April, with core prices up 0.3
per cent, against 0.2 per cent.
Figures for May industrial production, due on Wednesday, are expected to
show a rise of just 0.1 per cent, down from 0.3 per cent in April, partly
because of a decline in output from vehicle manufacturers. Operating rates
were probably around 83.5 per cent, compared with 83.6 per cent in April.
Retail sales, also due tomorrow, appear to have been uninspiring in May,
with sagging sales at car dealerships and chain stores.

FT  13 JUN 94 / World Bond Markets: Hopes raised for return to stability -
International
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Signs that, at long last, investors are prepared to take their chances on
new issues which they believe to be attractively priced have raised hopes
that after several difficult months, some degree of stability has returned
to the eurobond market.
Among last week's issues, the three deals which appeared to have worked the
best were the Province of Ontario's Dollars 1bn offering of 10-year global
bonds (its first global deal in its new fiscal year), Wal-Mart Stores'
Dollars 250m issue of five-year eurobonds and the Dollars 250m issue of
10-year eurobonds from Unilever.
'When a deal is fairly priced, it is selling well,' says Mr Simon Meadows,
joint head of syndicate at CS First Boston, adding that one month ago this
would not have been the case. However, while there is evidence that the
market has stabilised, it will take a long time for activity to return to
the levels seen at the start of the year, he says.
Closer inspection of these deals suggests that issuers are having to scale
down the size of their offerings and give up several basis points on pricing
in order to encourage investors to buy the bonds.
'Last year, if Ontario's bonds were trading at a yield spread of 64 basis
points over Treasuries in the secondary market, it could raise Dollars 2bn
at 63 over,' says one syndicate manager. 'But this year, Ontario has to make
do with Dollars 1bn at 67 over.'
The market has also been unwilling to believe estimates from the
book-runners that 60 per cent of Ontario's bonds were placed with investors
in North America. Many syndicate managers say that as much as 80 per cent
went to North America, which reflects badly on the level of demand in
Europe, where investors have been badly hurt by the sharp slide in European
government bonds this year.
'The market is still in a sensitive state, and as the Unilever deal shows,
it is still a domain for the tip-top names,' says Mr James Garvin, head of
syndicate at SG Warburg.
Investors who are willing to return to the market are selective about
currencies, although they appear to be more comfortable with longer
maturities than they were only a few weeks ago. Deals denominated in dollars
and yen remain the most attractive, while the recent rush of Canadian dollar
offerings has appealed mainly to retail investors wishing to roll over
expiring Canadian dollar holdings. Redemptions of Canadian dollar eurobonds
are estimated at CDollars 1.9bn this month, CDollars 500m in July and
CDollars 1.9bn in August.
There is some speculation that last week's successful deals will prompt more
dollar offerings this week, including a five-year global issue from a
European sovereign borrower. The market can also expect the first global
offering from Freddie Mac, the US government agency, to emerge in the next
three weeks. The mandate for the issue, which is likely to raise Dollars 1bn
and have a maturity of five years, has been awarded to Goldman Sachs and
Salomon Brothers.
By contrast, deals denominated in sterling, French francs and D-Marks are
having a rougher ride, mainly due to continuing interest rate uncertainty in
the underlying bond markets, though structured deals denominated in Italian
lire have been popular. Many issuers who want to access these sectors of the
eurobond market are waiting for the results of the European parliamentary
elections, since a large protest vote could unleash a fresh bout of
volatility in government bond markets.
Argentina is also expected to show some flexibility on pricing when it
braves the D-Mark sector this week. It is expected to raise between DM400m
and DM500m through an issue of short-dated eurobonds, via Deutsche Bank. The
three-year bonds are likely to be priced to yield between 220 and 240 basis
points over the corresponding German government notes, which compares with a
secondary market yield spread of 200 basis points on Argentina's outstanding
five-year bonds.

THAILAND
The stock exchange of Thailand has agreed to lower the entry fee for new
brokerage seats from the original asking price of Bt350m (Dollars 14m) to
Bt300m staggered over five years, following complaints from Thailand's 37
sub-brokers and the securities and exchange commission, writes William
Barnes in Bangkok.
The fees, previously revised from Bt350m to Bt305m, are still above the
SEC's suggested Bt200m. Nevertheless the commission has indicated it will
allow this revised price to stand.
The 40 full members of the exchange have at least responded to the request
of Mr Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda, the finance minister, for an explicit and more
open policy on admitting new members. Subject to certain minimum
qualifications all sub-brokers, many of whom have foreign joint venture
partners, will be allowed full membership of the exchange, perhaps within
two or three years.
New brokers will pay Bt200m upfront and then pay 10 per cent of their
trading commissions to the exchange for five years or until that total
reaches Bt100m, whichever is the sooner.
BEIRUT
The foundation for a revived Beirut stock exchange will be laid on June 23,
when secondary trading opens in Solidere, the Dollars 1.8bn property
development company created earlier this year in one of the Middle East's
biggest flotations, writes Mark Nicholson in Cairo.
The secondary market in Solidere's 1.8m shares will, said Mr Nasr Chamaa,
managing director, as with its launch subscription, be open only to Arab
investors. A grey market in the Dollars 100 par issue has already seen
shares change hands at a 20 per cent premium, bankers say.
Formal over the counter trading will open under the auspices of the Societe
Financiere du Liban, which is jointly owned by Lebanese commercial banks.
The trading floor, which will at the same time become the market for
Lebanese Pound treasury bills, will at first have seats for about 30
members, the majority being local commercial banks.

FT  13 JUN 94 / Emerging Markets: Markets watch Euro election results -
Currency Markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Foreign exchange traders will start the week by trying to assess the impact
of the European elections held yesterday and last Thursday.
The countries they will be watching most closely are the UK and Spain where
the ruling parties are weak and vulnerable to an electoral setback.
Last Friday sterling shrugged off a dismal, but widely expected, set of
by-election results for the Tory party. Another setback in the European
poll, however, would inevitably reopen speculation about the political
future of Mr John Major, the prime minister.
He has vowed that he will not be driven out of office, but the political
uncertainty preceding a leadership challenge in the autumn could weigh on
sterling. Some observers argue that a change in Tory leadership could be
well received by the market.
Others maintain that the possibility of a Labour government is not in the
market, and political developments which increase this prospect may well
undermine sterling.
Sterling watchers will also have a barrage of economic data on which to
feed.
The retail sales and average earnings figures will be closely watched. An
expected rise in the latter will encourage the Bank of England to argue for
a tightening of monetary policy.
Markets will also keep a close eye on the Mansion House speech of Mr Kenneth
Clark, the chancellor. The speech is traditionally a monetary policy
set-piece and will be combed for any hints on the future passage of interest
rates.
In Spain the European elections coincide with regional elections in
Andalucia, the stronghold of the socialist government. A setback there will
arguably be as damaging as the predicted defeat at the hand of the
conservative Popular party in the European poll.
The risk is that if the Socialists do very badly, they will lose the backing
of their Catalan allies, which would precipitate an election. This
uncertainty would undermine Spanish financial markets and the peseta.
The US also faces a heavy week of financial data which should give analysts
a better picture of second quarter growth and the likelihood of another
near-term tightening of monetary policy by the Fed.
The May consumer price index is released on Tuesday, but other indicators
include the Atlanta and Philadelphia Fed indices, retail sales, housing
starts, industrial output and capacity utilisation for May.
Analysts believe the data should be good for the bond market, which, if
recent performance is anything to go by, will help the dollar.

FT  13 JUN 94 / Emerging Markets: Tel Aviv declines against a rosy
background - The Emerging Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID HOROVITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The figures make depressing reading.
The Tel Aviv stock exchange has been declining steadily for the past five
months and at the end of last week the general share index stood at 185.45 -
a slight improvement on the previous week's 20-month trough of 176.21, but
still far from its mid-January height of 258.36.
The index yesterday closed at 189.21.
In May alone, the average investor lost 27 per cent on share dealings and,
that same month, companies traded on the exchange lost Shk37bn (about
Dollars 12bn) in paper value.
Although most of the day to day falls have been minor, the cumulative effect
has analysts comparing the decline to crashes in years past.
Particular comparisons are drawn with October 1983, when revelations of an
illegal bank share manipulation sent shares into free fall, losing by as
much as 90 per cent of their value.
Yet the spring and early summer of 1994 have seen no hint of any similar
widespread stock market scandal. And, in contrast to other past rapid market
declines, the economy is generally in buoyant shape.
Prof Jacob Frenkel, the governor of the Bank of Israel, has predicted 5 per
cent growth in the economy this year, with 8 per cent growth in exports and
unemployment levels falling from 10 per cent to 8.5 per cent.
So with such an apparently rosy economic background, why is the stock market
plunging?
And why is investor confidence so low when the exchange has attracted an
estimated Dollars 2.5bn in foreign investment, which increased tenfold
between 1988 and 1993, and rose 25.5 per cent in 1993?
A group of economists on the Knesset Finance Committee Capital Markets
Subcommittee has attempted to find explanations.
Mr Sam Bronfeld, the director of the Tel Aviv stock exchange, asserted that
the non-appearance of an anticipated 'peace dividend' following the
Israeli-PLO agreement on limited autonomy for the Gaza Strip and the Jericho
area of the West Bank was a significant factor.
The market had risen on hopes of accelerated growth and massive new
investment following last September's White House signing of the framework
peace accords. But it was now falling amid realisation that such investment
was slow in coming.
Analysts have also pinned some blame on the crisis surrounding Kupat Holim
Clalit, Israel's largest health insurance fund, now on the brink of collapse
with debts of Shk1.2bn.
Only a few large pharmaceutical companies have so far been directly
affected. But hundreds of private companies that supply the health fund are
now braced for a blow, and the economy as a whole will be asked to share the
burden.
While these factors may have played some part perhaps a more significant
cause has been the disappointing first quarter results reported by many
companies.
Dozens of companies held back from issuing their results until the final
deadline two weeks ago, and almost across the board there were reports of
falling turnovers and declining profits.
Excuses were many and various. They included falling prices worldwide (in
the case of the giant Israel Chemicals concern, for example); on increased
competition (which hit the Tempo beer and soft drinks company, marketer of
Pepsi in Israel); on shekel-dollar exchange rate fluctuations unfavourable
to exporters; on staff salary increases stemming from good company
performances last year; and on the falls on the stock exchange itself, where
many companies had invested surplus funds.
Mr Yair Sidel, who reports on the Tel Aviv stock exchange for Israel Radio,
said that the instability of the market had now reduced foreign investment
to a minimum and led to the scuppering of plans by a leading French bank to
set up a multi-million dollar fund to invest in the exchange.
The Israeli bond market has escaped the worst of the falls, with the big
Israeli banks among the chief purchasers.
But the stock exchange malaise has now spread to the New York exchange,
where about 50 Israeli companies are traded.
The New York-traded Israeli shares began slipping after the Hebron mosque
massacre on February 25, said Mr Howard Sterling, managing director of
Corporate Finance at Oscar Gruss investment brokers in Tel Aviv.
'Seeing the falls in Tel Aviv, the Americans simply followed suit,' he said.
But, he added, the 'selling frenzy' has eased off a little in the past three
weeks.
'Share values have fallen to the point where people are starting to buy
again,' he said, 'and the forecasts are good. The fundamentals are positive.
Israel's high-tech prospects are as good as Silicon Valley's were in the
1970s.'
Analysts are hoping that the Tel Aviv exchange will now follow that faint
lead from New York.
The Bank of Israel is also trying to restore stability with new regulations
limiting how much credit banks may offer customers to finance stock market
investment.
Mr Moshe Mandelbaum, the former Bank of Israel governor, asserted on June 8
that the market had probably now reached its lowest point.
And, said Mr Amiram Sivan, chief executive officer of Bank Hapoalim,
Israel's biggest bank, 'there is no economic reason for the falling share
prices.'
But unless there is a sustained rally, said Mr Yerah Nissan, deputy managing
director of Bank Hamizrahi, a real crisis of faith could develop, bringing
panic selling.
That kind of crisis would have deep implications for the government's
already slow-moving privatisation programme.
Indeed, when only last week the government announced plans to sell 51 per
cent of its holding in El Al, the national airline, the first question
analysts asked was whether the offer would find subscribers in the declining
Israeli market.
Most analysts are agreed on one thing: the market and the economic
atmosphere overall could benefit from a firmer display of financial
management by Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and his government.
Mr Avraham Shochat, the finance minister, and Mr Benjamin Ben-Eliezer, the
housing minister, are widely criticised for their failure to halt the
soaring house prices which are fuelling inflation.
In a week that included an Israeli air strike against Hizbollah guerrillas
in Lebanon and numerous crises stemming from the Palestinian autonomy
accord, Israel's newspapers consistently featured the stock market falls as
front page news.
Yet when Mr Shochat was asked to comment on the market slump he merely
replied that, yes, 'there is a crisis on the stock exchange. But the economy
is really moving, and eventually the stock exchange will adjust itself to
the economy, not the other way around.'

FT  13 JUN 94 / The Markets: Opec needs to tread carefully - Commodities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With oil prices having enjoyed a modest but, to producers, welcome rally
over the past month or two, one of the main tasks of delegates at the Vienna
meeting this week of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries will
be to avoid damaging the market's new-found buoyancy.
The scope for influencing the market positively seems very limited, but from
the opening of the meeting on Wednesday traders will be watching for signs
of a weakening in members resolve to maintain a reasonable degree of
discipline on export quotas.
Prices are about Dollars 3 higher than they were when the Opec ministers
last met in March and agreed to keep the overall output ceiling at 24.52m
barrels a day for the rest of year. Output has remained closer to 25m b/d
but that has not deterred buyers, many of whom see demand for Opec oil
growing to about 26m b/d by the final quarter.
Traders warn, however, that any talk of quota reductions, most likely from
Iran, the chief price 'hawk', could backfire if the cuts failed to
material-ise.
Iran could also pose a threat to the cartels' perceived solidarity through
its persistence in maintaining the candidacy of Mr Kazempour Adebili, its
ambassador to Japan and representative on the Opec board of governors, for
the Opec secretary-generalship in place of Dr Subroto of Indonesia.
'All of the rest of Opec, including Saudi Arabia, is in favour of
(ex-Venezuelan oil minister Alirio) Parra simply on his merit alone, but it
must be a unanimous decision,' one of the Gulf Arab delegates told the
Reuter news agency on Friday.
Other events this week include a three-day International Precious Metals
Institute conference starting in Vancouver today and, from tomorrow for four
days, a European Metals conference in Freiburg, Germany, at which Mr Philip
Crowson, chief economist of RTZ Corporation, will be among the speakers.

FT  13 JUN 94 / The Markets: Employment challenge - Economics Notebook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Globalisation is one of those ugly words impossible to avoid when discussing
the world economy. It is defined by the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development as a widening and deepening of companies'
operations across borders to produce and sell goods and services in more
markets. It involves international investment, trade and collaboration for
the purpose of product development, production and sourcing, and marketing.
Last week, in its Jobs Study, the Paris-based OECD cleared globalisation of
contributing significantly to the sharp rise of unemployment in the
industrialised countries to about 35m today.
Although the OECD said international economic integration had produced more
intense competition and a greater need for economic adjustment among its
member countries, it claimed that it had also yielded increased efficiency
and welfare.
Globalisation has, however, produced sweeping changes in recent years. The
chart shows how strongly world wide outflows of foreign direct investment
grew in the 1980s. The average annual increase was 29 per cent between 1983
and 1989, nearly three times faster than trade and almost four times faster
than world economic growth.
The annual number of international collaboration agreements among companies
doubled during the 1980s. In manufacturing, international sourcing of
components and intermediate goods used to make finished products grew faster
than domestic sourcing and now accounts for at least half of imports by the
big industrial countries.
Behind these broad figures, there was, the OECD says, 'a turbulent process
of birth and death of firms, the rise and fall of whole sectors of activity
and the reallocation of production within, as well as between, regions and
countries'. This resulted in the wholesale destruction of many jobs, perhaps
one in 10 a year, but the creation of a similar number of new ones.
However, these manifestations of globalisation were largely concentrated in
the industrialised countries.
In their recent study, Europe in 1998*, economists from the Ereco consortium
of European economic institutes described the 1980s 'as a lost decade for
developing nations'.
The OECD calculates that exports from low-wage countries account for only
1.5 per cent of overall spending on goods and services in its member
countries. On present evidence, it concluded, the impact of imports from low
wage countries was 'too small to account for a significant part of either
current unemployment or falling relative wages of the low skilled' in the
industrialised world.
This analysis, however, was based on conditions in a world that no longer
exists. It is debatable whether globalisation will remain such an intra-OECD
phenomenon following the collapse of communism.
At a seminar organised by the Guardian newspaper last week, Prof Fritz
Scharpf of Germany's Max Planck Institute pointed out that the end of the
Soviet Empire had made it safe for companies to invest in low cost countries
without fear of expropriation.
In a paper prepared for ministers at its annual meeting last week, the OECD
acknowledged that globalisation was rapidly involving China and the fast
growing Asian economies as well as parts of Latin America and eastern
Europe.
Ereco expects that the recession-induced slowdown in foreign direct
investment in the early 1990s, shown in the chart, will be followed by an
increase of about 50 per cent in the world stock of such investment by 1998.
The consortium has forecast a doubling to Dollars 80bn in the annual flow of
foreign direct investment to the developing world between 1992 and 1998.
That would lift the developing countries' share of the world stock of
foreign direct investment from the present 20 per cent to 25 per cent.
Globalisation could therefore have a far more pronounced impact on
employment in the industrialised nations in the years ahead.
The good news is that markets in developing countries will be growing fast.
But so will be their skills. As Ms DeAnne Julius, the chief economist of
British Airways, and Mr Richard Brown, a UK economic consultant, point out
in the London Business School's latest International Economic Outlook**,
South Korea had more 20 to 24 year olds in education as a proportion of the
population than either France or Germany in the late 1980s.
The lesson drawn by both Ereco and Brown and Julius is that the OECD
countries must focus more on the provision and international trade of
services. Brown and Julius warn that manufacturing jobs will become
increasingly low paid in the mature economies.
According to Ereco, the future will see an increasing hybridisation of
manufacturing and service activities at intra and inter-company levels. The
consortium cites a Swedish study, showing that already as little as a fifth
of labour costs in manufacturing companies goes towards the actual process
of manufacturing and assembly. New technologies and materials require more
complex distribution networks so that marketing, distribution and after
sales service will be of more importance in employment terms.
The OECD is commonly described as the club of the world's leading
industrialised countries. If these predictions prove true, a new definition
will be needed very soon.

FT  13 JUN 94 / The Markets: California dreaming of recovery - Global
Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US is not so much a single economy but an agglomeration of regional ones
with their own, varied business cycles, and for the past three years
California, the biggest single state economy, has been sunk in recession,
badly trailing the national recovery in business activity.
Now, however, California is showing the first glimmerings of an economic
upturn, with a fragile recovery in housing and a modest increase in
employment from the trough of late 1993. Is the 'golden state,' which lost
its image of boundless opportunity during the recession, about to regain it
once more ? And if so, how can investors benefit?
A report out this week from a well known research group, the cumbrously
named Center for the Continuing Study of the California Economy (CCSCE),
points out that venture capital fundings in Silicon Valley reached record
levels in 1993 and the first quarter of this year: evidence, it says, that
the state's recession was not caused by a broad based, permanent loss of
strength.
California, it argues, still has strong long-term growth potential -
provided the politicians are prepared to put money into critical investments
in education and infrastructure.
The group points to the strength of the state's high technology industries,
its excellent position for trading with the fast-growing nations of Latin
America and the Pacific Rim, and its strong population growth. This, it
predicts, will produce a 27 per cent increase in employment between 1993 and
2005, well ahead of a 17.5 per cent national average.
Long-term, this argument looks plausible. But it should not not obscure the
short-term problems which suggest that California's economic recovery will
be a slow one.
Two factors have made the recession here particularly long-lasting: the
bursting of a property bubble, and a sharp drop in both US defence spending
and the global civil aerospace business.
Both are heavily concentrated in the south of the state, and, indeed, it is
probably more correct to call the recession a Southern California
phenomenon. More than 70 per cent of the state's job losses have occurred in
one southern county - Los Angeles. The north of the state, led by a buoyant
Silicon Valley, has largely tracked the national recovery.
In the south, however, the contraction of the defence industry is permanent,
and may yet have some way to go, while the civilian aerospace side is barely
out of its cyclical trough.
It remains uncertain that commercial real estate values have touched bottom.
Some large Japanese corporate investors, who bought at the top of the cycle,
are rumoured to be on the point of selling.
The area also faces formidable problems of traffic congestion, crime,
environmental degradation, and racial tension, as well as the aftermath of
January's earthquake.
Nor do the obvious stock market plays on a Californian recovery look
particularly generously priced. Among the banks, BankAmerica, with flat
earnings for the past 13 quarters, has a price/earnings ratio broadly in
line with the super-regional universe, while Wells Fargo, which has enjoyed
a surprisingly strong share price over the past two years, is discounting a
fair amount of good news.
In telecommunications, Pacific Telesis, the state's phone company, faces
increasing competition from newcomers wanting to break its monopoly and
large capital outlays.
It recently spun off its fast growing wireless business into a newly quoted
company known as AirTouch. This has a strong spread of cellular and paging
interests not just in California, but in other parts of the US and Europe.
It has a good track record and more than Dollars 1.5bn of flotation cash in
its pocket. The shares are not cheap, but they represent a means of riding
recovery on both the West Coast and in Europe, as well as a stake in the
explosive worldwide growth of wireless communications.
Fed policy
Global markets are likely to be influenced strongly this week by a cluster
of US economic statistics which could significantly affect the timing of the
next tightening by the Federal Reserve.
For much of the past month US bond prices have rallied on the hope that the
Fed's half a point tightening in May will be sufficient to slow the US
growth rate and thus the threat of inflation.
But growing doubts about this optimistic picture emerged last week, with
statistics suggesting that the loss in momentum might not be as great as
Wall Street is hoping, and a continuing surge in the price of industrial
commodities.
Last week's statistics were relatively minor, but those due out this week
are not. And any that emerge worse than the Wall Street consensus could
knock bonds hard, since that would increase raise the prospect of further
tightening by the Fed at its policy making meeting on July 5-6 .
That still seems unlikely. Various Fed governors have been quoted over the
past week as saying that inflation is under control. Even Mr Alan Greenspan,
the Fed chairman, said at a London conference that price data had been
'clearly restrained,' though he added the rider that this was historical
data.
Yet as Mr Lawrence Lindsey, another Fed governor, points out, the Fed funds
rate is still only about 1 1/2 percentage points above inflation, compared
to an historical average closer to 2. A truly neutral Fed policy implies
more tightening before the year is out, and there is a distinct possibility
of a summer move - the FOMC also meets on August 16 - if growth remains
robust. The rally of the past fortnight may be no more than a bounce in a
bear market.

Apple Computer announced that Mr Paul Stern had resigned from its board of
directors, just six months after joining, 'to avoid any perception of
conflict of interest'.
Mr Stern, a former chief executive of Northern Telecom, the Canadian
telecoms group, is now a limited partner with Forstmann Little, a private
investment firm.
He is also a member of the board of directors of General Instruments, an
electronics manufacturer active in the market for cable television set-top
boxes.
Apple plans to enter that market through an alliance, announced last month,
with IBM and Scientific Atlantic, one of GI's main competitors.

FT  13 JUN 94 / International Company News: Trizec lifts offer to creditors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Trizec, the Calgary-based property developer, is poised to finalise its debt
restructuring after improving its offer to creditors with the help of a
CDollars 300m (USDollars 218m) injection from an investment group led by New
York financier Mr Gerald O'Connor.
A committee of senior debenture holders, who have held out for better terms
since Trizec launched its recapitalisation almost a year ago, has urged its
members to approve the proposals. Information meetings for debenture
holders, many of which are European institutions, will be held in Zurich,
Toronto and New York over the next fortnight.
The injection by the US investment fund, known as Argo Partnership, brings
the Trizec rescue package to more than CDollars 1bn. Horsham, the holding
company controlled by Canadian entrepreneur Mr Peter Munk, earlier agreed to
put up as much as CDollars 717m.
Under the latest plan, Horsham will have a maximum equity stake of 44 per
cent in Trizec. Argo will own 24 per cent, leaving outside shareholders with
31.5 per cent. Trizec, which is North America's biggest publicly-traded real
estate developer, is presently controlled by Toronto's Bronfman family.
The main change in the latest offer is a CDollars 300m increase in the
amount of cash available to securities holders, as an alternative to the
common shares to be issued under the plan. The cash amount available to
senior debenture holders has risen from 55 per cent of the value of their
loans to 76 per cent, or a total of CDollars 917m.
Mr Kevin Benson, Trizec's chairman, said that besides improving the chances
of the debt restructuring going through, the sweetened 'liquidity offer'
should have a stabilising effect on Trizec's share price once the plan is
implemented. It hopes to implement the debt-restructuring towards the end of
July.

FT  13 JUN 94 / International Company News: Ice-cream retail war hots up in
China - Western entrants have the locals licked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the Great Australian Ice Creamery opened its first retail outlet in
China last week, it marked the latest shot in one of China's hottest retail
wars.
While the Australian company may not be a household name internationally,
some of its competitors are - notably Walls of the UK, which began producing
its best-known brands in Beijing this month.
Walls is investing USDollars 50m in a Beijing factory and retail outlets in
its efforts to capture a share of the China market, which is only now being
introduced to western-style ice-cream.
Mr Bob Smith, general manager of Walls (Beijing), said that by any standards
China, with its 300m urban dwellers, was a huge market - bigger, in fact,
than continental Europe, where Walls is the dominant brand.
'All the indications are that Chinese people like eating ice-cream and
eating food out-of-doors,' he said.
Western ice-cream companies entering China have been flying by the seats of
their pants, in the sense that they have concluded that researching the
market would be futile.
'To be absolutely honest, we did very little research,' said Mr Smith. 'We
decided the best way to find out was to come here and get established.''
Walls, which is part of the Anglo-Dutch Unilever group, signed a joint
venture agreement in 1992 with a Chinese company called Sumstar, an offshoot
of the old ministry of light industry. Under the agreement Walls is an 85
per cent shareholder with Sumstar a 15 per cent partner.
Walls' main competitor at this stage is Bud's Ice Cream of San Francisco,
which in 1991 began producing ice-cream at a factory in Beijing. Its output
has reached 1.5m gallons annually, using local milk and cream. Investment in
its Beijing venture is Dollars 1.6m, with a further Dollars 1m planned.
Ms Alice Chiu, marketing manager of Bud's, said the company did not worry
too much about the competition. 'The market is simply so huge,' she says.
The Chinese market is crowded with local producers. In Beijing alone there
are some 600, but they are hardly competitors to foreign entrants since
their products, sold for a few cents, consist mostly of flavoured ice.
Apart from Walls and Bud's, other foreign manufacturers in the field include
Kraft General Foods, which recently launched a small range of 'cup' products
under its Kibon brand name used in Brazil, where it is market leader.
But in light of Unilever's recent takeover of Kraft's US ice-cream making
arm, it is not clear whether the US company will continue its fairly small
operation in Beijing. Kraft's representative in Beijing declined to comment
on its ice-cream plans in China.
Nestle, the Swiss company, is also pushing into the China market with its
Dairy Farm brand. It has begun producing in southern China and plans a joint
venture in Beijing. Other joint ventures include Meadow Gold, linked with
Malaysian interests, and Louis D'or, launched with Taiwanese capital.
Companies like the Great Australian Ice Creamery and Baskin Robbins of the
US differ from other producers in that they are establishing boutiques
selling 'scooping ice-cream'. The Australian company opened its first near
Beijing zoo and has plans for two others, one near the Great Wall.
Mr Smith said Walls would concentrate its efforts initially in the Beijing
area, where it had already established 500 outlets with 3,000 planned by the
end of the month in shops and hotels.
'It's early days but things have been going exceptionally well. People
appear prepared to pay for quality,' he said.
Walls is able to secure 70 to 80 per cent of raw materials in the local
market, the exceptions being high-quality chocolate and flavourings. It
imports about half the materials required for packaging but hopes that in
time it will be able to source most of its product and packaging locally.
A Walls Cornetto sells for Yn3.50, which is about 40 US cents, or much the
same price as a can of Coca-Cola in China. With urban incomes rising, this
is well within reach of an increasing number of Chinese who would not be
seen dead eating a locally-produced bing gur, or flavoured ice.

FT  13 JUN 94 / International Company News: Court ruling hits Baby Bell
competitors
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in several upstart North American telephone companies fell sharply
late on Friday after a court overturned new regulations meant to help them
compete against the established Baby Bell US local telephone monopolies. The
Bell companies hailed the ruling as a significant victory.
A federal appeals court in Washington overturned a 1992 ruling by the
Federal Communications Commission, the government agency which oversees the
telephone industry, which required local monopolies to set aside space in
their central offices for competitors to place equipment allowing them to
inter-connect lines with the monopolies' networks.
The Bell companies say such 'physical co-location' of equipment is not
necessary to promote competition and prefer to have 'virtual co-location',
with competitors' lines connected from locations near, but outside, their
central offices.
The court said the FCC had overstepped its legal authority and ordered it to
re-examine its decision.
The ruling is not expected to prevent competition coming to the local
telephone market, but it could slow its progress. The uncertainty created by
the court's ruling could make state telecommunications regulators more wary
about forcefully backing new rivals to the Bells.
Shares hit by the ruling included Omaha-based MFS Communications, which
serves corporate customers in more than a dozen cities and fell Dollars 3
3/4 to Dollars 24 7/8 at Friday's close.

FT  13 JUN 94 / International Company News: Outokumpu in FM1.2bn share offer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Outokumpu, the Finnish mining and metals group, has launched a FM1.2bn
(Dollars 217m) international share offer on the back of a sharp improvement
in profits in the first four months.
The Finnish state is also selling part of its stake in the company to raise
FM400m. The moves give further impetus to the Finnish privatisation
programme and will reduce state ownership in Outokumpu to as little as 38.2
per cent from 50.1 per cent.
Outokumpu and the state will offer 18m A shares, increasing to 21.3m shares
if there is strong demand. All shares will carry warrants, giving
subscribers the right to acquire one additional share for every six warrants
before June 28 1996.
The offer is mainly aimed at international institutions, although there will
also be a Finnish retail tranche. Proceeds will be used to strengthen
Outokumpu's balance sheet, lifting its equity-to-assets ratio towards a
targeted 40 per cent from 28.7 per cent at the end of April. It will also
help finance investments in the group's base metals and stainless steel
businesses.
The offer will be marketed in the second half of June, and pricing fixed in
early July. Global co-ordinator is S. G. Warburg Securities. Kleinwort
Benson Securities, Merrill Lynch International and
Prospectus/Kansallis-Banking-Group are co-lead managers.
This will be Outokumpu's third share issue in little more than a year and
comes on the back of a strengthening financial performance and rising metals
prices.
The group lifted pre-tax profits to FM304m from FM21m in the first four
months of 1994, despite a 4.8 per cent fall in net sales to FM5.51bn.
Improving market conditions, rationalisation and reduced debt are expected
to maintain the better trend over the rest of the year.
Outokumpu's shares fell FM6.60 to FM85.20 on Friday.

FT  13 JUN 94 / International Company News: Intel and Hewlett-Packard seek
best of both worlds / A look at the implications of a new power axis in the
computer industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Intel's alliance with Hewlett-Packard to develop a new generation of
microprocessor chips could, if it lives up to the companies' expectations,
become the most important computer industry partnership of the decade,
defining the direction of computer technology for years to come.
The Intel-HP partnership links the world's largest semiconductor
manufacturer and dominant supplier of microprocessor chips with the
second-largest US computer company, creating a new power axis in the
computer industry.
Intel plans to collaborate with HP in a broad joint research and development
project 'aimed at providing advanced technologies for end of the decade
computers'. The companies will together design 64-bit microprocessors,
related semiconductor production technology and software.
For both companies, microprocessors are a critical technology. The chips are
the 'brains' of computers and determine, to a significant degree, the speed
and power of a computer and what types of software it will run. The new
partnership could, therefore, prove to be a decisive factor in the success
of both companies.
For Intel, the HP technology alliance signals a shift of loyalties. Since
the late 1970s, Intel has been closely linked to IBM, still its largest
customer, as the developer and supplier of microprocessor chips for IBM and
IBM-compatible personal computers.
Intel's relationship with IBM has been frayed, however, by IBM's adoption of
PowerPC, a new microprocessor architecture jointly developed by IBM,
Motorola and Apple Computer, as the foundation for many of its future
products.
IBM and Motorola are promoting the microprocessor as an alternative to Intel
chips in PCs. Apple has launched several Macintosh PCs based on the PowerPC
chip and IBM is expected to introduce its first PowerPC 'personal systems'
in a few months.
By working with HP, Intel aims to expand its market into microprocessors for
use in higher performance computers such as workstations, network servers
and mainframes, while also defending its leadership in microprocessors for
PCs.
HP brings several strengths to the partnership. The computer company has its
own microprocessor architecture, called PA-Risc, which has helped to make it
a leader in the market for computers that are linked by networks. HP is also
an expert in 'open systems' software, which has become an important standard
for distributed computing.
Unlike IBM and Digital Equipment, HP is flourishing. Its sales rose 24 per
cent last year to Dollars 20.3bn, overtaking Digital to become the
second-largest US computer company.
HP and Intel aim to combine the 'best of both worlds'. Their jointly
developed chips will draw on Intel's expertise in high volume chip
manufacturing and its dominant role in the PC arena and HP's experience in
very high-performance Risc (reduced instruction set computing)
microprocessors and its understanding of the 'open systems' field.
The HP-Intel chips will run both PC software and open systems software
without modification, the companies said. If they can achieve this without
sacrificing the performance of existing software, Intel and HP will have a
clear advantage over all competitors.
However, HP and Intel do not expect to see the first fruits of their
collaboration until late in the decade, giving PowerPC and other rival
microprocessor architectures such as Digital Equipment's Alpha time to
consolidate their positions. Competitors characterised the alliance as an
attempt to catch up with their technology.
'We have a six-year lead on them,' said Mr Willie Shih, vice-president of
Digital Equipment. 'Intel and HP are endorsing our technology direction by
developing 64-bit microprocessors, but we have already sold Dollars 1bn
worth of computers based on our Alpha microprocessor.'
IBM similarly maintains that Intel's plans are a defensive move. 'This
(partnership) affirms our view that Risc is the current and future answer
for high performance microprocessors,' IBM said. 'While HP and Intel are
entering the research phase we already have chips and products on the
market.'
However, by merging their long-term research and development efforts, HP and
Intel will bring huge resources to their efforts to create a new generation
of microprocessors that, they say, will leap-frog their competitors
products. Although the companies declined to discuss financial arrangements,
they indicated that both expect to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on
the effort.
Such resources can only be matched, at present, by the IBM, Motorola, Apple
Computer PowerPC team. This raises questions about the future of rival
microprocessor standards from Digital Equipment, Sun Micro-systems and
others.
Analysts have long predicted that only two or three microprocessor
architectures will have a significant role beyond the end of the decade. Now
it appears that consolidation may be under way.
Still, Intel and HP face significant technological and management
challenges. Their partnership holds great promise but - like many other
alliances in the computer and semiconductor industries - it could prove
barren unless both sides prove willing and able to collaborate fully.

FT  13 JUN 94 / International Company News: Ford aims to increase car sales
in Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ford, the US motor vehicle manufacturer, has launched an aggressive strategy
to gain a bigger share of the Japanese new car market.
It has begun to export right-hand drive cars to Japan for the first time
from the US and from Europe, and has also set prices in Japan which undercut
many rival import models.
The group, the world's second largest manufacturer of cars, has benefited
from the strong appreciation of the yen, and claims that in some cases its
products are now priced below similar models from domestic Japanese
competitors.
Ford has already increased its holding in Autorama, its Japanese
distribution channel, to 45.1 per cent to give it parity with Mazda, its
24.5 per cent-owned Japanese affiliate.
Ford's trademark is replacing the Autorama name on Ford dealers' signs
throughout Japan, and it has begun to expand dealer outlets through other
channels with the opening of the first three Nissan/Ford dual dealers.
Previously, most of the cars sold under the Ford marque in Japan have been
rebadged Mazda products.
But the US company has now launched a strategy to give equal importance to
the sale of imported cars in the Japanese market.
It has set itself a target of selling around 200,000 cars a year in Japan by
the year 2000, of which half would be imports (chiefly from Ford plants in
North America and in Europe) and half would be rebadged Mazdas.
Last year, it sold 39,753 rebadged Mazdas, such as the Ford Telstar (Mazda
626) and the Ford Laser (Mazda Familia/323), in Japan, while sales of Ford
cars imported from the US totalled only 5,111.
This month, Ford has launched in Japan right-hand drive versions of its
European-built Mondeo, which is produced at its plant at Genk, Belgium, and
has begun to sell right-hand drive versions of its Probe coupe, which is
built at AutoAlliance, its 50:50 joint venture plant with Mazda, in the US.

FT  13 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Harrods claims damages
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Harrods, Britain's most famous department store, has put in a counter-claim
for damages amounting to hundreds of thousands of pounds against a former
employee who is suing the Knightsbridge store for Pounds 23,000 in severance
pay.
Harrods said it would vigorously defend the High Court action brought by Mr
Nicholas Whalley who had been taken on to modernise the store's distribution
systems.
'Mr Whalley had been given an important job to do but he abdicated that
responsibility and allowed the situation to continue for six months,' it
said.
Mr Whalley was dismissed in March for failing in his duties and for failing
to safeguard the interests of Harrods, the company added. The store's claim
for damages is with respect to contracts for new equipment entered into by a
man Harrods claims was not qualified to do so.
This situation had also cost Mr Stephen Taylor, Harrods' personnel director,
his job. These departures come in the wake of the highly-publicised
resignation in April of the store's former managing director, Mr Peter
Bolliger. Earlier this month, Harrods said all differences had been resolved
amicably.
Harrods has appointed a successor to Mr Whalley but declined to reveal his
identity.

FT  13 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Notices could assist French Eurotunnel
share investigation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The routine issuing of Section 212 notices by Eurotunnel, the Channel tunnel
operator, following its Pounds 858.3m rights issue, could provide important
information for the Commission des Operations de Bourse, the French stock
market regulator which is investigating French claims that Eurotunnel shares
were manipulated ahead of the rights issue.
After big share offerings or rights issues, it is standard procedure for
companies in the UK to send out these notices which oblige investors to
provide details of their shareholdings. A by-product of these notices is
that the company can also find out who has bought or sold its shares.
Last month, Mr Christian Cambier, head of a French association for
Eurotunnel shareholders, wrote to the COB calling for an inquiry into the
movement of shares in Eurotunnel ahead of the announcement of its rights
issue.
'It seems that massive selling may have deliberately weighed on the share
price since the beginning of May and that curiously shares in Eurotunnel may
have been lent between institutions during the same period,' he said in the
letter.
Although selling 'short' is legal in the UK and regularly occurs ahead of a
rights issue, the exercise could benefit large institutions at the expense
of small shareholders.
Eurotunnel said it would co-operate fully with the COB.

FT  13 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Further hurdle for C&amp;G offer - Ruling may
bar payments to mortgage borrowers say advisers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society said yesterday that it believed
that it had been barred from making payments to its 370,000 mortgage
borrowers as part of its proposed Pounds 1.8bn acquisition by Lloyds Bank.
The society's legal advisers have said that last week's court ruling
prohibited payments to its borrowers as well as its investing shareholders
of under two years' standing.
The interpretation erects a second hurdle to Lloyds' acquisition because,
under the 1986 Building Societies Act, borrowing members must pass a
separate vote in favour of the transfer to another company.
The society said that the interpretation was one reason why it expected to
take several weeks to devise a new scheme to comply with the judgment made
by Sir Donald Nicholls, the Vice Chancellor, last week.
Although it has estimated that 27 per cent of its 825,000 shareholders, or
some 220,000, would be unable to vote under the ruling, it is expected to
re-examine its records to check whether this figure is correct.
C&amp;G has already closed investing accounts to new members temporarily to
prevent inflows of funds.
The requirements for the borrowing members' vote are less onerous than for
the vote among investing shareholders because the borrowers' resolution
needs only to be passed by a majority of those voting.
That is in contrast to the shareholders' vote, which must be passed both by
a majority of those eligible to vote, and a 75 per cent majority of those
actually voting, a figure made hard to achieve by the court ruling.
The society has ruled out paying members in preference shares rather than
cash. Among options it is considering is persuading shareholders of less
than 2 years standing to transfer to non-voting deposit accounts.
Although the judge ruled that it was allowed to make payments to depositors
who are ineligible to vote it would risk being taken back to court by the
Building Societies Commission if it paid shareholders cash to give up voting
rights.
The longer the society delays devising a new scheme, the more of its
investing members will qualify for payments. However, Lloyds could come
under pressure from the stock exchange to clarify its intentions publicly.

FT  13 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Quiligotti calls for Pounds 1.5m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Quiligotti, the USM-quoted tiles and flooring group, has launched a 1-for-3
rights issue at 15p to raise about Pounds 1.5m net in order to restore its
resources following the acquisition of Cristofoli in April.
The group also announced reduced pre-tax losses of Pounds 2.53m (Pounds
3.3m) for the year to March 31, and that it had applied for admission to the
Official List.
In addition, Quiligotti has disposed of its Irish subsidiary, Quiligotti
Ireland, to its management for Pounds 1 plus the payment of some
intercompany debt.
Quiligotti Ireland, which is involved in the contract laying of hard
flooring systems, will be appointed as the group's distributor in Ireland.
Group turnover for the 12 months amounted to Pounds 12.9m (Pounds 15.2m)
including Pounds 1m from acquisitions and Pounds 824,000 (Pounds 1.22m) from
discontinued activities. The pre-tax result was after restructuring costs of
Pounds 1.03m. Losses per share came through at 1.22p (4.4p).
Irrevocable undertakings have already been received to take up 46.6 per cent
of the underwritten rights issue of 11.22m new ordinary shares.
As anticipated last October, the company intends to consolidate its shares
on the basis of one 5p share for every 10 existing 0.5p ordinary shares.
Mr Campbell Allan is stepping down as chairman with effect from July 4. He
will be succeeded as chairman by Mr Kenneth Hodgson.

FT  13 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Pillar Properties sets up joint venture
fund
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pillar Properties, the UK investment company due to float later this week,
has formed a Pounds 250m joint venture investment fund to buy retail
property in the UK.
The venture has been set up with part of Canada's largest public pension
fund manager, Caisse de depot et placement du Quebec, which controls about
Dollars 33bn (Pounds 22bn) of assets.
It shows the resurgence of confidence in the UK property market since the
launch of another joint venture fund by Mr George Soros and British Land a
year ago which has invested more than Pounds 500m.
The latest investment company, which will be managed by Pillar, will focus
on shopping centres, with an average purchase price of about Pounds 30m.
The fund will buy properties which require active management, including
refurbishment, and it intends to be fully invested within two years. Profits
will be split between the two partners, but Pillar will receive an
additional carried interest, to reflect its management role.
Pillar and its partner, Societe Immobiliere Trans-Quebec, will initially
inject Pounds 30m each, and acquisitions will be funded by a combination of
equity and non-recourse debt.
The company has built up assets of Pounds 330.4m. It is managed by Mr
Raymond Mould and Mr Patrick Vaughan, founders of BAe's property arm,
Arlington Securities.

FT  13 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Ennemix cuts float price by up to 30%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ennemix, an east Midlands aggregates company, has been forced to cut its
flotation price by more than a quarter after institutions failed to back its
original proposal.
This unusual plan involved raising almost Pounds 9m from a rights issue
offered to existing shareholders of Anglesey Mining, a quoted north Wales
mining group.
Mr Christopher Stainforth of merchant bank Guinness Mahon, which is advising
both companies, said that institutions had used the deal's complexity as an
excuse for not backing it. He said there were signs that the new issue
market was recovering but because Ennemix needed new funding to complete an
acquisition it could not wait.
It is therefore going ahead with an orthodox flotation but the price has
been cut by '25-30 per cent'.
Faced with the lower price, Nash Sells, the venture capital company, has
decided not to sell any of its 23 per cent stake.
Mr Stainforth said the amount raised for Ennemix would be the same as under
the former plan though the total raised would be between Pounds 6m and
Pounds 7m.
The original proposal would have seen Ennemix inject a much needed Pounds
600,000 into Anglesey in return for a 15 per cent stake.
Anglesey believes its creditors will continue to support it for the time
being and it has been given assurance from Imperial Metals Corporation, its
largest creditor which owns 41 per cent of its shares.

Forecasts for Unigate suggest a rise of about Pounds 10m from the Pounds

reflection of Unigate's greater recovery from a lower base and the
restructuring of activities it has been pursuing since the arrival of Mr

FT  13 JUN 94 / Bond weakness slows property upswing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The sharp upswing in commercial property values over the past year has been
brought to a halt as a result of weakness in the bond market and a lack of
growth of property rents.
Total returns from the property investment market for the year to May were
29 per cent, down on April's figure of 29.3 per cent, according to a monthly
index published by Richard Ellis, chartered surveyors.
'Capital growth due to significant movements in investment yields have
temporarily come to an end, yet the anticipated rental growth has not yet
started to appear,' according to Richard Ellis.
Most participants in the property market expect the setback to property
prices to be slight. Mr John Ritblat, chairman of British Land, said the
market's cooling was a symptom of balance emerging between numbers of buyers
and sellers. 'The froth has blown off the market,' he said. Hillier Parker,
chartered surveyors, believes that average property yields, the ratio of
income to capital, have been stable over the last month at 7.2 per cent. Mr
Greg Nicholson of Hillier Parker believes they are likely to edge up by one
percentage point over the coming month.
The principal reason for the slight setback to the commercial property
market is the behaviour of the bond market. The movements in bond prices had
a heavy influence on property value last year since - in the absence of
rental growth - property's long-term, secure income stream tends to be
valued like a bond. This year, the link between property and bonds has
loosened, as investors have become more optimistic about prospects for
rental growth. A few months ago, property yields fell below gilt yields as
investors became convinced that rental growth would soon re-emerge. The gap
between property and gilts yields is now more than one percentage point.
Some investors are nervous about the size of this reverse yield gap until
bond yields settle down or there is firm evidence of rental growth. 'There
is great uncertainty in the market as to what is happening', in the view of
Mr Marc Gilbard of Goldman Sachs. If gilt yields were to move out to say, 9
per cent, he would expect property values to fall in the short term.
Investors' nerves are also being tested by the paucity of evidence of rising
rents, except in a few markets such as prime Central London office space.
Richard Ellis reports that rents fell in May, after stabilising in previous
months. Mr Andrew Walker of Institutional Property Forecasting Services, a
subsidiary of Erdman Lewis, has cut its estimate of total returns for this
year from 18.3 per cent to 10.7 per cent as a result of downgrading rental
forecasts.
Properties most affected by the weakness of the bond market are those let at
above-market rents and so have the least prospect of rental growth. Agents
estimate that around Pounds 800m-Pounds 900m of over-rented property for
sale in the City is having difficulty in attracting buyers. However, demand
is still strong for certain parts of the market, particularly shopping
centres and prime high street shops. Agents believe that several billion
pounds of institutional funds are allocated to the property sector. In
particular, unit trust managers have raised significant sums to invest in
property.

FT  13 JUN 94 / Not divorce but a partial separation: John Griffiths talks
to Honda about its European strategy after BMW bought Rover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the immediate aftermath of the decision by British Aerospace to sell
Rover Group to BMW, Honda appeared bent on filing for a bitter divorce from
the UK car company which had been its partner for 14 years. Tempers have now
cooled; pragmatism has set in.
Honda and Rover have still undergone a partial separation, in that their
cross-shareholdings have just been unwound.
But their collaboration on specific projects will continue, and possibly be
renewed, for as long as there is considered to be mutual advantage.
Honda meanwhile considers itself free to form as many liaisons with other
European partners as it might choose, according to the Japanese carmaker's
president, Mr Nobuhiko Kawamoto. And while mention of BAe still provokes
frowns of disapproval among Honda executives - who maintain that BAe should
have let Rover remain independent and British - it is a measure of how much
the atmosphere has lightened that even BMW is not excluded as a potential
project partner. This flexibility in attitude towards partners present and
potential is one of several key elements in a long-term strategy for Europe
just drawn up by Honda, and which has what Mr Kawamoto describes as a
'mid-term' goal of almost doubling Honda's car sales in the region by the
year 2000.
What the long-term goal might be, Mr Kawamoto is not yet willing to say. But
it almost certainly will involve a further expansion of Honda's car making
facilities at Swindon in south-west England beyond even the 50 per cent
increases in capacity, to 150,000 cars a year, announced in Tokyo last week
and to come on stream in 1998.
The capacity increases, together with the installation of a Pounds 30m body
pressings plant, form another element in the strategy. They will provide
Swindon with stand-alone capability and viability, says Mr Kazue Ito,
currently executive vice-president of Honda Motor Europe, and who is to
succeed Mr Miyake as president of UK-based HME on June 29.
They would allow Honda to 'strongly accelerate the self-reliant strategy
which we have been pursuing' since the Rover takeover, says Mr Kawamoto. The
unspoken message was clear: Honda may form other project partnerships in
Europe, but never again will it willingly make itself vulnerable within a
long-term, strategic alliance.
Even ignoring the reasonable assumption that Honda's long-term goal is to
lift its European sales higher than the 300,000 (2 per cent of the total
market) projected for the year 2000, the expanded Swindon capacity is
inadequate on the basis of Honda's own numbers.
According to Honda's strategy presentation last week, 150,000 of those sales
will be provided by cars built at Swindon.
Yet Swindon is also to supply cars to the Middle East and Africa, regions
for which HME and Mr Ito are also taking over responsibility. Honda already
sells 50,000 cars in these markets and in the longer term they could take up
to 10,000 from Swindon, according to Mr Ito.
Other elements in the new European strategy should help Honda achieve its
goals, most notably the addition of more than 500 dealers to the European
network, bringing the total to 2,300, by the end of the decade.
The strategy needs to work. The new investment at Swindon, including a new
model to be developed for the end of the 1990s at a cost of Pounds 240m,
will total Pounds 330m.
Given that the spending will be phased over several years, it is a
relatively small amount for a group with consolidated net sales and other
revenues last year of Y3,862.7bn (Pounds 24.6bn). Even so, Honda's profits
have come under increasing pressure. Three weeks ago it disclosed a further
36 per cent fall in net profits for its financial year to March 31, to
Y23.6bn, following four straight years of profits decline from nearly Y100bn
in 1989-90.
Mr Kawamoto insists, however, that Honda has turned the corner and that
efficiency improvements and market recovery in North America and Europe
should see profits more than double in the current year.
The new European strategy is not confined to cars, and itself forms only
part of a wider set of policies through which Honda will try to ensure its
long-term presence in a globalised auto industry.
Honda also produces motorcycles, car engines for itself and Rover, lawn
mowers, generators and a variety of other power products in Europe.
From now on the development, manufacture and sales of all of these are to be
integrated and co-ordinated by HME.
Altogether, says Mr Ito: 'Honda has 800,000 customers a year in Europe.'
Many car buyers, he points out, are also natural purchasers of other Honda
products like lawn-mowers and there is a logic in multi-product showrooms.
The same integration will go on throughout the four global regions into
which Honda has split its operating activities: the Americas, Asia/ Oceania,
Japan and the new Europe/Middle East/Africa grouping.

FT  13 JUN 94 / UK shares fall out of favour with funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK fund managers' enthusiasm for buying British equities has waned further,
according to the latest monthly poll of investment intentions from Smith New
Court and Gallup.
The balance of bulls over bears of UK shares has fallen from 20 per cent in
April to 8 per cent in the June poll, carried out early last week. This is
in spite of a balance of 28 per cent of respondents, up from 17 per cent in
May, expecting the FT-SE 100 index to rise over the next three months, and
81 per cent (74 per cent) bullish on the index over the next 12 months.
Fund managers have become more bullish about gilts, however, with the
balance of those planning to buy over those expecting to sell rising from 2
per cent to 16 per cent between May and June.
A desire to reduce cash balances, currently 3 per cent of pension funds'
money, is persisting and fund managers' favourite target market is the
Japanese equity market, with Smith New Court saying investors were
'rampantly bullish' about the outlook for this market. The balance of buyers
over sellers was 47 per cent in the June poll although the market has
already risen significantly this year.
Among other European markets, fund managers favour France, Germany and Spain
at the expense mainly of Italy. The US market is expected to show the lower
growth over the next 12 months than the UK, Japan or Europe.

FT  13 JUN 94 / Company News (This Week): Trading under way in privatisation
shares - Koninklijke PTT Nederland
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Trading gets under way today in shares of Koninklijke PTT Nederland, the
Dutch telecommunications and postal operator which is being partially
privatised in the biggest share launch in the history of the Amsterdam stock
exchange.
The 138.15m shares were priced at Fl 49.75 with private investors given a
discount of Fl 2.50 per share up to a maximum of 75 shares. The price was at
the high end of expectations but the offer was nearly three times
oversubscribed.
The Dutch state, which is raising nearly Fl 7bn (Pounds 2.5bn) through the
sale of a 30 per cent stake in the company, is eager for trading to go well
to pave the way for a second tranche by late 1997.
It will also be watching to see how many private investors cash in their
shares immediately to realise the difference between the price they paid and
the price fixed for institutional investors. This is the first Dutch
privatisation in which small shareholders have been given a financial
incentive to take part.
With a total market capitalisation of Fl 22.9bn, KPN will be the third
largest company listed on the Amsterdam bourse, behind the exchange's two
Anglo-Dutch giants, Royal Dutch/Shell and Unilever. It will account for more
than 7 per cent of the market's total capitalisation.

FT  13 JUN 94 / Company News (This Week): Recovery may prove a moving
experience - NFC
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
NFC's performance is viewed as a bellwether indicator of economic activity,
so the transport and logistics group's interim results due out on Wednesday
will be carefully scrutinised.
In March the group, which reports its results on a quarterly basis, reported
an 11 per cent increase in underlying growth. At that stage the company,
which derives around two thirds of its revenues from the UK, said the
domestic economic recovery remained variable, and noted there were no signs
of recovery in continental Europe.
The second quarter is traditionally the weakest for NFC and year-on-year
comparisons this time around will be particularly onerous because the
year-ago figures were flattered by the Pounds 50m profit on the sale of the
group's waste management arm.
Reflecting this, first half pre-tax profits on an FRS3 basis are likely to
fall from Pounds 86.6m to Pounds 53m. However they should show healthy
growth from Pounds 37.5m to about Pounds 49m on a normalised basis as the
recovery in the US and UK economies begins to pull more consumer goods
through the distribution pipeline serviced by NFC's logistic operations.
Meanwhile the upturn in the housing markets should help Pickfords moving
services but investors will also be looking for further clarification on the
future of Lynx, the loss-making parcels business.
Earnings growth will continue to be held back by the dilutive effects of the
Pounds 263m rights issue completed in January which has nevertheless removed
balance sheet pressures and provided additional flexibility to expand the
distribution and removal businesses internationally.
NFC has already used some of the resulting Pounds 89.4m net cash to fund a
handful of modest-sized acquisitions including several overseas.

FT  13 JUN 94 / Brussels rethink over steel plan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The European Commission will this week reconsider its rescue plan for the
steel industry amid renewed warnings from Mr Karel Van Miert, European Union
competition commissioner, that he will walk away from it unless he wins
support for a flexible interpretation of rules on state aid.
Mr Van Miert's stand puts him on a collision course with Sir Leon Brittan,
chief EU trade negotiator. Sir Leon is unhappy about the planned grant of
Ecu415m (Pounds 319.55m) in Italian state aid in exchange for the closure of
steelmaking in Brescia, northern Italy. Sir Leon fears that this would
undermine efforts to reach a steel agreement with the US.
Mr Van Miert said the Brescia cuts were crucial for the Commission to reach
its target of reducing steelmaking capacity in the EU by 19m tonnes by
September. Some bending of the rules was necessary if the targets were to be
met, he added.
In Brussels, Mr Van Miert's allies hope Sir Leon will soften his position to
win the backing of the Italian government for his bid to succeed Mr Jacques
Delors as president of the European Commission. A spokesman for Sir Leon
said the two issues were separate. Mr Van Miert's decision to distance
himself from the steel rescue plan means that the slim chances of a revival
lie with Germany's Mr Martin Bangemann, EU industry commissioner.
Mr Bangemann, co-architect of the plan, wants a generous interpretation of
the rules to take account of the complicated cross-ownership of the Brescia
mini-mills. The web of company shareholdings means not all companies linked
to steelmaking would close, raising the legal question of whether state aid
can be used for 'partial closures'.
Last month, Mr Van Miert suffered a defeat after Sir Leon argued in favour
of a rigorous interpretation of the steel code on state subsidies.
Mr Van Miert said he was relaxed about a possible collapse of the steel
plan.
'I was simply trying to do what I had been asked, but if the conclusion is
we can't go ahead, that is no problem,' he said.
Mr Van Miert said he had opposed proposals to adopt an interventionist steel
policy based on production quotas that would have resulted only in freezing
capacity. German steel producers are believed to have favoured such a
'crisis cartel' approach.

approach, combining support measures in exchange for capacity cuts.
Unless the deadlock can be resolved, the Commission will put an end in
September to the flanking financial aid measures currently available for the
decommissioning of capacity.

Rising bond yields, a weak dollar and anxiety about inflation look like a
sure-fire recipe for a rising gold price. Yet bullion has been stuck around
Dollars 380 an ounce since the turn of the year. Part of the reason may be
that the speculative funds which fuelled the gold rally in 1993 have
switched into other commodities, notably base metals. Neither are the
fundamentals of supply and demand as compelling as last year.
The discretionary buying which buoyed gold in the early months of last year
has fallen away. Purchases by Indian, Chinese and Middle Eastern buyers were
all lower in the first quarter. The relatively smooth transition to
democracy in South Africa - which still accounts for around one third of
world gold production - has also reduced the risk of disruption to supply.
Central banks have not been selling bullion on the same scale as last year,
when between 500 and 1,000 tonnes were released. With around 35,000 tonnes
in their vaults, though, the threat of liquidation is never far away when
the gold price rises towards Dollars 400.
Yet the biggest dampener on bullion is the rising trend in US interest
rates, which has increased the cost of holding a non-yielding asset. If
rising rates reflect real inflationary pressure that drag could soon be
outweighed by other factors. The worst of all possible worlds for bullion
would be if the US Federal Reserve has timed its monetary tightening just
right. Rising real interest rates combined with relatively low inflation
would be a powerful argument for lower gold.

Judging by its buoyant equity market, there is a mood of optimism in Japan.
Yet Tokyo's strength is partly a function of weakness elsewhere. With other
markets upset by US rate rises, international investors have had to scratch
around to find a suitable home for their money. The question is whether they
are right to conclude Japan is the place. The dollar's modest recovery
against the yen helps, but it is hard to argue that the earnings outlook is
really bright enough to allow the bull run to go for much longer. The Bank
of Japan's latest Tankan survey of business confidence shows more corporate
restructuring coming, despite the improvement in sentiment.
The Nikkei 225 average is currently on a multiple of 89 times prospective
earnings for the year to next March. That is demanding when the average
company is expecting an increase of only around 8 per cent in pre-tax
profits. Measured in relation to cash flow the market is on a more
reasonable multiple of around 13, a reflection of the size of depreciation
charges following the late 1980s surge in capital investment.
But it looks as though the sheer weight of cash is the main factor. Domestic
investors may be driven just as much by fear of missing out on a bull run so
far fuelled mainly by foreign institutions. Liquidity also propelled the
market before its spectacular collapse in 1990. That lesson is engraved deep
on the heart of the Bank of Japan. It may not now want to risk another
bubble by dropping the official discount rate.

The European Commission will try to breathe life into its moribund steel
plan this week. Wednesday's meeting will focus on whether Italian state
subsidies can be provided to close 6m tonnes of capacity in the Brescia. The
original scheme, promoted by Mr Karel Van Miert, the competition
commissioner, was shot down on the grounds that such aid was legally
dubious. His fellow industry commissioner, Mr Martin Bangemann, is
attempting to revive the Brescia scheme so that the overall plan of cutting
19m tonnes of capacity can be salvaged.
What happens in Brescia is of little relevance to British Steel, which does
not produce steel rods, the speciality of the Bresciani companies. Brescia
cuts are more relevant to direct rivals such as ASW. But even it would have
derived few benefits from the original Brescia scheme. Though some capacity
would have been cut, the Bresciani producers would have been able to
continue producing at similar rates and would have been financially stronger
as a result of the subsidies.
More important for British Steel is whether the European steel industry has
seen its last round of state aid. The Commission would do better to ensure
this is genuinely the last round rather than seeking further capacity cuts.
Not only does it look odd to be demanding plant closures at a time when the
European economy is picking up. A firm line on subsidies would provide the
best guarantee that overcapacity does not become a problem in the next
recession. Steel makers would then know they could not rely on their
governments to bail them out.

five minutes before closing time, he obviously knew what he was looking for.
Hamish McRae's The World in 2020, about 'power, culture and prosperity - a
vision of the future', is typical presidential reading material. David
Selbourne's The Principles of Duty, billed as a 'powerful criticism of the
corrupted liberal order', sounds equally worthy. But wasn't Selbourne the
maverick left-wing don who upset the left by writing for The Times when the
unions were up in arms against Rupert Murdoch's plans for the paper? He was
so hated that he was drummed out of Oxford.
Peter Arnett's memoirs of a hack who has covered every recent war from
Vietnam to Kuwait also looks a bit of an odd choice. Could Clinton be
planning how to survive a siege conducted by liberals who fear a sell-out?

Last week's gathering of two thirds of the world's central bank bosses, on
the occasion of the Bank of England's tercentenary, was such a rare event
that it deserves a collective noun. Charles Goodhart of the London School of
Economics has suggested a 'discretion' of central bankers, but Observer is
open to better suggestions.

They take Latin seriously in Toledo, Ohio. Richard Ehret, a classics master,
recently got into trouble with an over-enthusiastic attempt to infuse life
into the tongue of Catullus, a Roman poet.
Ehret's offence was to introduce into the classroom phrases like 'in
dentibus anticis frustum magnum spinaciae habes' and 'braccae tuae
aperiuntur', which loosely translate as 'you have a big piece of spinach on
your front teeth' and 'your fly is open'.
'Totally inappropriate,' said school superintendent Kenneth Bishop. Ehret,
who claims he was trying to make his classes interesting and merely took
examples from the textbook Latin for all occasions, was suspended without
pay for 10 days.

FT  13 JUN 94 / Observer: Merck's odd injection
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Merck chairman Roy Vagelos is one of the most brilliant US scientists of his
generation and has made Merck one the most admired companies in the
pharmaceuticals business. But in one respect Vagelos has failed.
He has not been able to groom an internal successor and has had to hand over
the chairmanship of one of America's top ten companies to a virtual unknown.
It is hard to imagine other US blue chips like Exxon, General Electric or
Coca-Cola prepared to take such a risk. Merck is not another IBM. It is not
short of good managers. So why has it turned to Raymond Gilmartin, 53, boss
of Becton Dickinson, a much smaller medical supplies company?
Gilmartin, who has spent 18 years with his firm, has no big drug company
experience and is not the sort of corporate super-star to stir Wall Street.
Admittedly, he has done the sorts of things on a small scale that Merck will
need to do if it is to prosper over the coming decade. Becton Dickinson
relentlessly cut costs during the mid-1980s and Gilmartin also boosted the
company's research and development budget to take it into more profitable
areas, such as diagnostic equipment.
The hope is that Gilmartin can work the same sort of magic at Merck. But
despite the best efforts of Merck's PR machine, Wall Street's initial
verdict is that he's a high-risk choice. Gilmartin will be in charge of a
Dollars 1.3bn R&amp;D budget, yet he has no background at all in the discovery
and development of new drugs. He joined Becton Dickinson after an electrical
engineering degree, an MBA from Harvard, and a stint as an Arthur D Little
consultant.
He's said to be charismatic and a hands-on manager, like Vagelos, whom he
succeeds on Thursday. Even so, the management succession at one of the
world's most admired companies looks like a botched job. Vagelos's abrupt
exit at Merck has given the impression that it's a one-man show, which it is
not.

FT  13 JUN 94 / Leading Article: Europe slips to the east
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Union looks better from outside than from inside, to judge by
the events of the last week.
Inside, the fourth direct election of a European parliament stirred little
positive enthusiasm, and was treated in most countries as a chance to
protest against incumbent governments. One might think that a visiting US
president, coming from a world power whose economy is growing strongly, with
much lower unemployment in spite of steadily increasing productivity, would
find little in the EU to admire or encourage. And one might think that a
small European country like Austria - which as a member of the European
Economic Area already enjoys access to the single market and has weathered
the recession better than most - would think twice about choosing this
moment to sign up for full membership.
Yet Mr Clinton used his trip to give the EU a ringing endorsement, even in
the field of defence from which his predecessors had been anxious to exclude
it; and the endorsement given by two-thirds of the Austrian voters perhaps
counts for even more, since they have to put their money where their
ballot-paper is. If anything should jolt the EU out of its recent
despondency it is that, for the first time in 20 years, a country with a
higher standard of living than its existing average, and one which will be a
net contributor to its budget, has actually decided to join, ignoring
attempts to scare it with a veritable barrage of Euro-nightmares from
drained reservoirs to floods of poisoned yoghurt. Should the Austrian
example be followed by Nordic countries later in the year, January 1 1995
will indeed mark a hopeful new beginning.
Austria's vote
By their vote, the Austrians have already moved the EU in a direction Mr
Clinton was urging it to go, namely eastward. In a literal sense, they have
moved its eastern frontier from the 15th to the 17th meridian, while waiting
for Finland to take it to the 31st. More significantly, while Finland (and
indeed Norway) would give it a common border with Russia, Austria gives it
one with Slovakia, Hungary, and Slovenia, and brings it within 20 km of
Croatia. Austria, even more than Germany and Italy, has felt itself involved
in the Yugoslav tragedy, and in proportion to its population has absorbed
larger numbers of refugees. Historically, its links are with the Magyars and
Slavs of the former Habsburg empire. It will use its membership, without
doubt, to incite the EU to play a bigger and more creative role in eastern
and south-eastern Europe.
Open markets
That is also where Mr Clinton put his emphasis. In his speech to the French
national assembly last Monday he said nothing about the single currency or
the single market. Instead he dwelt on 'the development of a European
defence identity', and on the importance of 'a broader Europe', open to the
east. He mentioned with particular pleasure that 'Nato recently approved an
American proposal to allow its assets to be used by the Western European
Union' (the EU's 'defence component'), and reiterated his call, uttered in
Prague last January, for western markets to be open to goods from eastern
Europe.
The Austrians would surely agree with the latter point. They may have
reservations about the former one. Neutrality, originally imposed on them in
1955 as the price of Soviet withdrawal, has become since the 1970s an
important element in their national identity, and their government felt
obliged to reassure them, during the referendum campaign, that this status
would not be affected. It would have been more honest to say frankly that
with the end of the cold war this concept has become an anachronism, that
Austria was proposing to join a union with a developing defence identity,
and that as the member-state closest to an unstable and war-ravaged part of
Europe it would have a stronger interest in that development than any other.
At least the Austrian chancellor, Mr Franz Vranitzky, has said that he
contemplates joining the WEU in due course. The next step, not only for
Austria but for its new partners, should be to weigh Mr Clinton's words
carefully. He is offering to stand by Europe, but only if Europe stands
militarily on its own feet.

FT  13 JUN 94 / Herculean task for UK defenders: The US-European contest to
supply the RAF's new generation of transport aircraft
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the UK defence secretary, is to make one of his most
painful public announcements next month when he outlines to parliament the
latest series of cuts in the armed forces. The ministry's review of defence
spending, code-named Front-Line First, will probably conclude that bases
should be closed, services privatised, and about 20,000 jobs lost, many from
RAF support staff.
To sweeten the pill Mr Rifkind can announce some new military equipment
orders. The Army may get up to 250 Challenger II tanks, the Navy its latest
batch of three Type 23 frigates and the Royal Air Force a substantial
updating of its Tornado aircraft.
But the result of one procurement decision is unlikely to be welcomed by all
sides of the UK defence industry. The race to replace half of the RAF's
ageing fleet of 60 Hercules transport aircraft is being run between US and
European competitors. Both sides have British partners, both badly want to
win.
Lockheed, the US manufacturer of the Hercules, is vying with a European
group, which will operate under the aegis of the Airbus consortium and
includes British Aerospace, to supply the new generation of transport
aircraft. Lockheed says it can provide the RAF with a first batch of 30 of
the latest generation of Hercules, called the C130J, at an attractive price.
Starting in 1996 the C130J will be available 'off-the-shelf'. Lockheed says
it will have none of the unexpected development costs and uncertainties
which often dog new aircraft.
British engineering companies such as Dowty and Lucas have won 12 per cent
of the work on the C130J in open competition against US competitors.
According to General Al Hansen, vice-president of Lockheed's air transport
programmes: 'The C130J is worth Pounds 2.2bn to British industry and will
secure 3,500 jobs in the UK if we sell 700 aircraft worldwide. Because the
RAF is a world-class air force we regard it as very important to secure them
as a launch customer for this new generation of Hercules.'
Lockheed is trying to make it worthwhile for the RAF to order the C130J. It
has offered a discount of about 10 per cent of the Pounds 750m-Pounds 850m
cost of the first 30 aircraft if the RAF is the launch customer. In an
unprecedented move, it will take the RAF's old aircraft in part-exchange,
provided they can still fly.
While the deal is financially attractive to the RAF, it is not critical to
UK participation in the C130J worldwide. Mr Frank Turner, the managing
director of Lucas Aerospace, says: 'We support the C130J to replace the
Hercules. But Lucas was chosen by Lockheed, regardless of UK interest, as
the global leader in our field, and we expect to keep our share of the work
whatever the UK decides.'
British Aerospace acknowledges that its own contender, rather prosaically
called the Future Large Aircraft, will not be available until at least 2000.
The development costs of the FLA, estimated by BAe at more than Pounds 2bn
for the consortium as a whole and Pounds 500m for the UK, will also need to
be met by the purchasing governments.
BAe argues that the FLA will be bigger, faster and more flexible than the
C130J. It will be able to transport helicopters, armoured personnel carriers
and field guns which the Lockheed aircraft is too small to handle. And while
each FLA will cost between Pounds 40m and Pounds 45m (including development
costs) compared with Pounds 25m for the C130J, its increased capacity,
flexibility and advanced technology will make the total lifetime costs of
its fleet lower than Lockheed's equivalent. Mr Dick Evans, BAe's chief
executive, says: 'The FLA would bring work to the UK worth between Pounds
5.5bn and Pounds 12bn and secure 7,500 aerospace jobs at the peak of
production.'
The argument over which aircraft the MoD should choose goes wider than the
technical merits of the two transporters. Mr Evans insists that the
aircraft's importance to the UK aerospace industry means that 'this decision
is just too important to be left to the Ministry of Defence'. BAe says that
if the government opts for the US aircraft, Britain will be forced to
withdraw from the FLA programme altogether.
This is because the share of work allocated on European collaborative
programmes has depended traditionally on how many aircraft each country
decides to buy. Between 250 and 300 FLA are expected to be ordered by the
consortium's European partners. But if the UK replaces the first half of its
Hercules fleet with the C130J, it will not need the 50 FLA which would
ensure Britain a 20 per cent stake in the project.
Decisions are to be made next year on how many FLA each European partner
wants. In continental Europe, enthusiasm seems to be running high. Both
President Francois Mitterrand and Chancellor Helmut Kohl stressed their
commitment to the FLA at the recent Franco-German summit.
Gaining a UK commitment to a 20 per cent share of the aircraft is regarded
as important by British Aerospace because that is approximately the amount
of work which goes into the aircraft's wings. BAe fears that if it does not
build the wings the German aerospace company Dasa will usurp its position.
Once Dasa is established as a wing-maker, BAe fears that it will not be able
to win its place back in future civil Airbus programmes.
BAe may be over-emphasising its dilemma: the total size of the FLA programme
is not yet clear and work-sharing arrangements may be flexible. On the
Eurofighter programme, for example, Germany looks likely to order fewer than
a quarter of all aircraft, but is trying to hang on to a third of the work.
However, an early decision to buy the new Hercules would be damaging to BAe
 -and the company has a case for arguing that a decision is being rushed.
The MoD has put up a strong fight for an early resolution of the debate: it
says the existing Hercules fleet is almost 30 years old and, according to a
House of Commons defence committee report, the Hercules' wings, tails, fuel
systems and flight deck will all need refurbishment in the next few years if
they are to remain in service.
Ageing is also reducing reliability, says the Ministry of Defence, and
pushing up maintenance costs. The ministry says each Hercules is only
available for 55 per cent of the time now, compared with 65 per cent in
1986. Worse is to come. The MoD estimates that the annual support costs of
the fleet will treble by 1998 without a programme of large-scale
refurbishment. Thus, for the Ministry of Defence, Lockheed's offer to begin
early deliveries has attractions.
But there are doubts about how urgently the aircraft need to be replaced.
The House of Commons select committee noted 'allegations' that the RAF may
be exaggerating the urgency of its requirements; the RAF sees an opportunity
to get new aircraft while there is still money available in its equipment
budget.
Similarly, the MoD and the Treasury have motives for a quick decision: the
ministry is anxious to announce equipment orders to counter the bad
publicity over job cuts, and the Treasury regards the C130J as the less
expensive option and is attracted by the good terms currently on offer from
Lockheed.
To counter such views and participate fully in the FLA programme, BAe must
persuade the government to implement its preferred strategy: a minimum
refurbishment on the existing Hercules fleet while waiting for the FLA to
become available. However that route was described by the House of Commons
defence committee as, 'prima facie an unattractive option' and it is clear
that BAe faces considerable hurdles: it would have to overcome doubts about
the cost of refurbishing the current fleet and squeeze a cheque for Pounds
500m to cover the UK's contribution to FLA development funds from a
cash-strapped MoD.
At present, BAe is simply arguing for more time to develop and present its
case, since the FLA will only complete its feasibility study at the end of
the year. It has used newspaper advertisements to raise public interest in
the issue and pressure the MoD to postpone a decision. One option it is
considering is an offer to maintain the Hercules fleet at a fixed price
until the FLA is available.
For BAe, a request for a delay does not seem unreasonable given the
importance of the decision to the UK aerospace industry. As one defence
industry observer puts it: 'Lockheed is not going to go away and this is a
decision the UK will be stuck with for 40 years. It will have knock-on
consequences throughout the civil and military aerospace sector. It may just
be worth taking another six months to make sure we get it right.'

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'The art of economics consists in looking not merely at the immediate but at
the longer effects of any act or policy; it consists in tracing the
consequences of that policy not merely for one group but for all groups.'
This is such a wise saying that it might have been coined by Adam Smith or
one of the great classical economists. It actually flowed from the pen of
Henry Hazlitt, the distinguished US economic journalist and author who died
last year aged 98. Hazlitt wrote superbly and deserves immense credit for
keeping his head during the middle decades of the century, when nearly all
his contemporaries were seduced by socialist ideas and Keynesian economics.
Indeed, in his analysis of economic and social problems, he was often
decades ahead of his time.
A self-taught polymath, he wrote or edited some 18 books*. But he is
probably best known for his short classic, Economics in One Lesson, which he
wrote in 1946, during time off from his job as economics leader writer for
The New York Times.
Many economists would dismiss it as a primitive effort. There are no
equations or graphs. There is no macroeconomics, because Hazlitt despised
'en bloc thinking that assumes away the individual differences that make up
reality'. There is nothing about demand management, because he believed in
'Say's Law' - the proposition that in a flexible market economy, supply will
create its own demand.
Seemingly anachronistic in its day, the book now looks prescient. Hazlitt
grasped the destructive power of special interest groups long before the
academic community. The difficulties inherent in economics, he wrote, were
'multiplied a thousandfold by a factor that is insignificant in, say,
physics, mathematics or medicine - the special pleading of selfish
interests.' He saw that such pleading was a natural result of the division
of labour: as individuals we specialise more as producers than consumers.
A steelworker, for example, may benefit from special government concessions
for his industry even if these make everybody else poorer. But he will be
hurt by every concession granted to other industries. It follows that the
only policy that is in everybody's interests is the apparently hard-nosed
doctrine of zero protection in trade and zero subsidies in domestic markets.
How much anguish might have been avoided in the postwar years if Hazlitt's
lesson had been thoroughly learned.
The second point he stressed is the need to pay attention to all the
consequences of a given policy, especially the long-term consequences.
Hazlitt understood the short-run attractions of deficit spending and public
works. He knew why decent people favoured minimum wages, rent controls,
union privileges and so forth. But he patiently analysed the long-term
results of these interventions, showing that they were almost certain to do
more harm than good. He worried about incentives, for work, saving and
investment, when leading Keynesians dismissed such talk as 19th century
claptrap.
Economics in One Lesson was an introductory text. If you want to see Hazlitt
at full throttle, read The Failure of the New Economics (Van Nostrand,
1959), a withering line-by-line critique of John Maynard Keynes's General
Theory. Hazlitt is wickedly irreverent, noting at one point: 'It is amazing
how many fallacies and inversions Keynes can pack in a small space, and
especially how many fallacies, like a set of Chinese boxes, he can pack
inside other fallacies'. He concludes that none of Keynes's significant
doctrines was both original and true. This will seem a cheap shot only to
those who have not sampled Hazlitt's scholarship.
He sometimes went too far - at least for colleagues. In 1944, Arthur
Sulzberger, then running The New York Times, lost patience with Hazlitt's
opposition to the Bretton Woods agreement. 'Now, Henry, when 43 governments
sign an agreement, I don't see how The Times can any longer combat this.'
Rather than compromise, Hazlitt stopped writing editorials on the subject
and later moved to Newsweek as a columnist. Hazlitt regarded the proposed
system of fixed but adjustable exchange rates, with only a partial tie to
gold via the dollar, as logically flawed and bound, eventually, to collapse
in a global inflation. History proved him right, although the Bretton Woods
system provided a stable monetary framework for longer than he expected.
He was prescient on numerous other issues. He anticipated Charles Murray's
critique of the US welfare system by more than a decade. He was an early
critic of postwar foreign aid, seeing from the start that trade and
investment were the keys to third world development.
Hazlitt was worldly enough to recognise that true believers in free markets
and minimal government would always be heavily outnumbered by activists
proffering instant 'solutions' to every social problem. Speaking shortly
after Barry Goldwater's crushing defeat in the 1964 presidential race, he
urged yet greater efforts, arguing that members of the libertarian minority
'can't afford to be just as good as the individuals in the majority. If they
hope to convert the majority they have to be much better; and the smaller
the minority, the better they have to be. They have to think better. They
have to know more. They have to write better.' Nobody could have set a
better example.

FT  13 JUN 94 / Leading Article: Mr Blair looks for renewal
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tony Blair is the likely winner of the Labour leadership contest. He is
also the most suited to the task. Five candidates have presented themselves.
It is striking that four of them, all improbable victors, are from the left
of the party. Mr Denzil Davies and Mr Ken Livingstone are mavericks. The
weightier pair, Mrs Margaret Beckett and Mr John Prescott, have put
themselves down for deputy as well as leader, a prudent insurance against
losing the real prize, since neither is possessed of the leadership
qualities the party needs. Mrs Beckett has proved her credentials as a
competent administrator, a reliable second-in-command, but that may be all
she has to offer. Mr Prescott is the voice of Labour's past.
It is therefore hardly surprising that half the parliamentary party and the
overwhelming majority of the shadow cabinet have declared their support for
Mr Blair. The two other thirds of the party's internal electorate - its
members in trade unions and its members at large - have yet to be consulted,
but the general expectation is that they will follow the pattern set by
their elected representatives. They will vote for Mr Blair if they want
Labour to win.
Some will do so with misgivings. At 41 his inexperience will be called in
evidence against him, but his very newness is also an asset. As he showed in
his interview with the Financial Times on Saturday, he has mastered a
coherent set of generalisations within which a credible Labour policy might
be developed. He has given the pro-market thinking of the 1980s an overlay
of social responsibility, affirming that the individual and community
strengthen one another. He has captured the theme of family values from the
Conservatives. To call this 'renewal' may strike a chord with the
electorate.
Freedom to reposition
This gives Mr Blair a freedom to reposition his party that his predecessors
lacked. 'It is positively in the public interest to have a dynamic market
economy,' he told the FT. Echoing President Clinton, he tackled another
logjam of left-wing thinking with: 'We want a nation at work and not a
nation on benefit.' As to state ownership, he said that 'most people would
not regard it as a sensible expenditure of money . . . that you
renationalise the water industry'. He defined full employment in the careful
words of the 1944 white paper.
Radical moderniser
Astutely put as they are, such statements merely set a tone; there is room
within them for Mr Blair to be the radical moderniser Labour needs, but
there is also room for fudge and muddle. Mr Blair evokes a sense of mission,
but he cannot rest on that. Before long he will have to provide specific
answers to questions about Labour policy. Having grown up during the
Thatcher ascendancy, Mr Blair is aware that the greatest British politician
of his own lifetime approached her first election victory, in 1979, in
comparable political circumstances. Mrs Thatcher resolutely avoided specific
commitments, preferring to speak about values and principles. In present
circumstances, Mr Blair would be unwise to regard this as a sufficient
approach.
The late Mr John Smith believed in keeping quiet while the Conservatives
tore themselves apart; had he lived he would have focused on policy at the
October 1995 party conference, in readiness for an election the following
year. Mr Blair should begin to fill in the blanks well before that, between
now and this year's conference. The list of gaps is large: strategic clarity
on Europe, a sense of what he means by modernising the welfare state, an
indication of where Labour proposes to draw the boundaries between public
and private enterprise. His declaration of support for a dynamic market
economy is meaningless unless he shows that he knows what it would take to
sustain it.
Leadership may be about broad perspectives and aspirations. Mr Blair is
showing himself skilled at offering them. But in the post-Communist world
there are no single ideological solutions. Specific, often technical,
policies are required. The new Labour leader must use the crest of the wave
on which he is now riding to drive his party's thinking forward. He must
show soon that his leadership will involve believable social, economic and
fiscal strategies. Without them the present expectant mood could quickly
change.

FT  13 JUN 94 / Mid-life change for insurers: Recent takeovers show how the
European industry is preparing for liberalisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Casual observers might get the impression that European insurers are in the
grip of takeover fever. Commercial Union's announcement last week that it is
poised to buy France's sixth biggest life insurer, Groupe Victoire, for some
FFr12.5bn (Pounds 1.45bn), is the latest in a recent flurry of deals. It is
also a further example of consolidation as the industry prepares to adapt to
a new and more liberal regulatory regime.
By the beginning of next month, European Union member states must implement
new legislation which completes the deregulation of their markets. And as
Europe emerges from recession, insurers appear to be becoming increasingly
acquisitive as they prepare for the competition which will result.
In January, Switzerland's Winterthur bought one of Germany's biggest
insurers, DBV, for an estimated DM900m (Pounds 360m). Last autumn,
Victoire's owners, Compagnie de Suez, the French financial conglomerate,
sold off Victoire's Germany subsidiary in a deal worth about FFr20bn to
France's Union des Assurances de Paris.
And in March 1993, Sun Alliance, one of Commercial Union's UK rivals, became
the biggest insurer in Denmark when it paid Kr1.27bn (Pounds 129m) to buy
the business of Hafnia, a company pushed into receivership after an
unsuccessful effort to expand.
Commercial Union's foray, to be financed through a mixture of debt, cash and
equity, is the most significant European acquisition by a UK insurer for 20
years and one of the biggest acquisitions of a French company by any UK
business.
Commercial Union has long harboured European ambitions - it acquired its
Dutch subsidiary in 1973. But for the UK insurance industry as a whole -
which has traditionally focused overseas activities in the United States and
other English-speaking territories - the deal marks a change in direction.
'Europe is our home market from which we seek to expand,' explains Mr Tony
Wyand, Commercial Union's finance director. 'A lot of people at the
political level approach Europe with ingrained suspicion. But more and more
business people regard the Continent as a significant opportunity to
increase profitability.'
Although the acquisition will leapfrog Commercial Union into the European
industry's 'premier league', Mr Wyand suggests that many of the benefits
stemming from economies of scale will emerge only in the longer term.
To a degree its timing - just three weeks before the 1 July deadline - is
coincidental and Commercial Union's approach to the deal, painstakingly
negotiated over the last three to four months, reflects the adoption of a
more realistic attitude to European expansion by many companies.
First, it is becoming clear that despite the achievement of a liberal market
framework the development of a genuine single European insurance market
could be a slow process.
By July 1 European Union member states must implement new rules which allow
insurers licensed in any state to trade throughout the union. Price control
and rules giving local regulators control over the types of insurance
policies available must be abolished.
But in practice most European markets are already liberalised in these
respects. Price control, effectively limited to motor liability insurance,
has disappeared in most EU countries - except Germany, Italy and some
smaller markets. Across the Continent, in line with long-established UK
practice, the focus of regulation is on ensuring the financial health or
solvency of insurance companies.
At the same time the EU directives will have no impact on a range of other
factors which are likely to restrict cross-border competition, especially
insofar as the needs of individual consumers - rather than corporate buyers
 -are concerned.
Europe's biggest insurers, such as Italy's Generali, Germany's Allianz and
France's UAP, dominate their local markets partially because the agents who
sell their products exclusively tend to enjoy high degrees of customer
loyalty.
Tax rules vary sharply between different states and are unaffected by the
new legislation. Differences in tax treatment have a crucial impact on the
life insurance market, where sales are often driven by tax advantages.
Although British life insurance policies frequently produce better returns
for policyholders, this is sometimes at the expense of higher risk and
volatility to which consumers in France and Germany have proved to be
averse.
In addition, local regulators will continue to enjoy some power, and could
restrict the extent to which overseas companies can compete. In particular,
they can limit the freedoms of companies whose policies are deemed to
conflict with a legal principle known as the 'general good'.
There are fears, for example, that some regulators could limit insurers'
ability to vary the premium rates charged to customers on the grounds that
such moves would be discriminatory, for groups such as ethnic minorities.
Second, it is partially the problems created by an over-hasty approach to
European expansion which have given Commercial Union its current opportunity
to expand. Many observers believe companies - such as Suez  - paid too much
to build their European operations in the late 1980s, in preparation for the
first phase of single market regulation. Rules lifting restrictions on
cross-border trade in large commercial risks - the so-called second non-life
directive - were implemented by member states in 1990.
Suez itself was unable to sustain its aggressive European strategy after
acquiring the Victoire group in a takeover valued at FFr27.4bn in 1989.
Denmark's Hafnia was pushed into receivership and Norway's Uni Storebrand
forced to restructure after launching a joint plan to take over Sweden's
Skandia, with the goal of creating a Scandinavian insurance giant capable of
competing with its larger European rivals.
A number of other companies made smaller, less ambitious, acquisitions in a
bid to establish a toehold. But few of these deals brought lasting benefits
and some, such as Guardian Royal Exchange's acquisition of an Italian motor
insurance company, left buyers with heavy losses.
'A decade ago the major companies were desperate to establish their toehold
in Europe. This quest typically resulted in making an exorbitantly priced,
though not necessarily large, acquisition in one of the fast-growing
southern European markets,' says Mr Michael Huttner, analyst with BZW, the
securities house.
'Over the last few years there has been a definite change in approach,' says
Mr Huttner, who believes insurers are much more likely to consider
alternatives to acquisition. The success of direct telephone sales in the UK
has spurred a number of companies to set up new operations in other EU
states as an alternative to purchase.
Winterthur, which owns the second biggest telephone insurer in the UK,
Churchill, recently set up another operation in Denmark, for example, while
its Swiss rival, Zurich Insurance, announced its intention earlier this
month to set up a new telephone insurer in Switzerland, which it intends to
extend throughout Europe.
Mr Wyand, who is part of the management team which has led Commercial
Union's recovery since its disastrous US losses in the early and mid-1980s,
is anxious to downplay any accusations of hubris.
'This is a strategic decision taken without regard to premium volume,' he
explains. Five years ago, companies typically paid prices equal to twice the
annual premium income of the businesses they acquired.
By contrast, Commercial Union has a bargain paying Suez a price equal to
about half Victoire's annual premiums. 'Size is the consequence of success
not the cause. We have obtained critical mass at a price we believe is
economic,' Mr Wyand insists.

   From Mr ROGER WOOLFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Robert Bischof's Euro-centric view misses the point (Personal View,
June 10). Yes, the UK 'is so often in a minority of one in Europe'. But
Britain's economic and social policies are not out of line with those of
North America, and not far different from the industrialised countries of
Asia Pacific. That is where the action and the growth is taking place, Mr
Bischof, not Europe. Britain's attitude is not a sign of being wrong. It is
a sign of being right.

FT  13 JUN 94 / Beware Ivy League, central bankers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last week's central banking symposium organised by the Bank of England was
attended by central bankers from 128 countries. The overt themes of the
conference were central bank independence, low or zero inflation and how to
achieve it. But there was a subtext, which reflected more nearly the main
concerns of the most important bankers present, but which was almost
entirely absent from the conference papers. This was whether it was enough
just to concentrate on restraining consumer prices, or whether the bubbles
which rise up and burst in the capital markets also need attention.
There was a justified scepticism about returning to capital market controls.
Direct intervention in markets for long-term assets obviously did not appeal
either. This left open only one option within the prevailing framework. This
was to take into account in monetary policy decisions, not only consumer or
product prices, but bond prices and even equities and real estate as well.
What would be the purpose of the whole operation? One justification might be
that large surges in asset prices will ultimately destabilise product prices
if allowed to go too far. But the real reason that central bankers lose
sleep is different. It is a fear that a slump in asset markets will one day
threaten the solvency of large banks whom they will have to bail out as a
result, as in the case of Continental Illinois.
There are also grounds for anxiety about the way in which central bankers
have become dependent on academic economists of the mainstream US Ivy League
variety.
An example occurred in the conference paper, Modern Central Banking, by
Professor Stanley Fischer of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who
is soon to become an assistant managing director of the International
Monetary Fund. I refer to his strong preference for a target for inflation
over a target for the price level.
An inflation target means that any upward overshoot in inflation above the
target range is not corrected. Bygones are treated as bygones and the price
level base from which future inflation is estimated drifts upwards. The
difference between the two is shown in the chart. With an inflation
objective, a series of modest unavoidable errors pushes the price level up
over some decades to a level four or five times as high as at the starting
point.
Fischer admits that with his preferred inflation objective, the price level
would not be predictable over generations. So Alan Greenspan's definition of
stable prices as a state in which inflation did not enter significantly into
business decisions would be violated.
Fischer's reason for accepting this fault is his extreme fear of the
deflationary episodes that would be required to correct overshooting, if a
target for prices, rather than their rate of change, was adopted. Assuming
that central bankers tried to correct half of any error in the ensuing year
output and employment could fluctuate violently.
This interpretation is a travesty of what price stability meant when we had
it. The author himself mentions that the same level of prices prevailed in
Britain in 1844, in 1881 and in 1914 under the gold standard. But that
standard did not mean that the Bank of England had to reverse any rise in
prices over the horizon of a short-term forecasting model.
There were several years at a time in which prices rose or fell; and over
the century as a whole, prices ranged between 70 and 130 (taking 100 as a
price index for the years just mentioned). Price stability meant that
looking ahead prices were as likely to fall as rise; and that the best bet
in long-term planning was that a pound in 30 years' time would be the same
kind of measure as a pound today.
The result was due to a policy regime, based on the ultimate convertibility
of notes and deposits into gold. It did not depend on having and
manipulating a model purporting to show how to manage output and prices over
the next few quarters.
What is the moral? Economics as taught in the US East Coast universities of
the United States is not to be written off as necessarily wrong or bogus.
But it does need to be treated with scepticism.
Mainstream North American economics is more like the speculations of
physicists on the origins of the universe or the nature of time than the
kind of physics used in splitting atoms or launching rockets.

FT  13 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Denmark more than just an 'ally' in
fight against EU fraud
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From MARIANNE JELVED
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I was pleased that the FT showed interest in the serious problem that
fraudulent use of Community funds constitutes with your article, 'A
labyrinth of loopholes' (May 19). As more and more resources are being
administered through the Community budget, the potential scale of the fraud
increases. The removal of internal frontiers with the creation of the Single
Market also poses new challenges in the fight against fraud.
However, the article needs some correction. It says concern about fraud is
most strongly felt in Germany, which has found allies in the Netherlands,
Denmark and the UK.
In my opinion Denmark has been more than just an ally. Denmark has played a
very active role in enhancing the focus on the war against EU fraud. The
protection of the financial interests of the Community was spelled out by
the Copenhagen European Council in June 1993 when it asked the Commission to
present a strategic programme for reinforcing the fight against fraud by
March 1994.
In addition, the Danish government published a note, 'The Community Budget
and Fraud', before the Ecofin council meeting in May this year. In this note
we suggest important additional elements to the Commission's anti-fraud
strategy. The note proposed speeding up member states' reaction to the
Commission's requests for control visits; the use of as precise and targeted
instruments as possible; and the development of systems to analyse the
results of various anti-fraud activities.
In addition, the note proposed more publicity to fight against fraud; and
use by member states of more common standards of control. The Commission's
control and auditing teams should to a larger extent be able to draw on
national audits in connection with EU control visits in member states. And
it is necessary also to focus on the problem that the country where the
fraud is committed is often not the same as the country of which the
swindler is a resident.
The Danish attitude is not only governed by economic interest. Misuse of
public funds runs counter to vital principles of openness and democratic
control. The fight against fraud is thus of utmost importance for the image
of the Community with our populations.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From R K ESSEX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, 'Europe looms small in UK voters' eyes' (June 8) is a worthy article
headline but I really must take issue with some of the rhetoric used.
'Mr Major's dismal domestic record', 'a painfully slow economic recovery'
and 'the largest tax increases in recent memory' are more in tune with the
Daily Mirror. Since the first comment is non-specific one should concentrate
on the latter two.
Over the past 18 months all successive forecasts of economic growth have
been revised upwards and the latest industrial output data, released on June
8, indicate something akin to a boom.
Unemployment has been falling for most of the past 15 months and nobody
predicted that. Not, I would respectfully suggest, circumstances synonymous
with painfully slow economic growth.
On personal taxation, fiscal policy has indeed been unexpectedly tightened
and the media has certainly concentrated the public's minds on that.
But why no mention of the monetary loosening and who at the time of the last
election would have predicted base rates at 5.25 per cent two years hence? A
little more objective reporting, please.

FT  13 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: R&amp;D: the crucial distinction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID DAMANT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Dr Mulvey of The Save British Science Society (Letters, June 9) and
others concerned with the question of the financing of research and
development, must make a crucial distinction: between the views taken by
investors through the pricing of shares on the stock exchange, and what
company managements believe the views of investors to be and what the stock
exchange does.
Many company directors are convinced that the stock exchange takes
short-term views. They may therefore take actions on that assumption, for
example to restrict R&amp;D expenditure, which can lead to unfortunate
consequences for the UK. But evidence on the stock exchange itself is that
long-term prospects, and the virtues of R&amp;D expenditure (when properly
explained, which is an important point), are in fact compounded in stock
exchange pricing mechanisms; the evidence is very much in that direction,
although not completely so. Anyway, the stock exchange is a rational place.
The solution to this problem is not for the government to act on false
assumptions by taking (almost by definition) inappropriate actions. The
correct response is to educate management and others in the efficient market
theory. But how can this be done?
The academic work on this subject is vast, based on papers which have won a
Nobel Prize. Yet, for example, the Commons trade and industry committee
concluded that 'research indicates that the stock market undervalues
long-term investment' on the basis of one academic paper alone. How many
parties to this debate can articulate the possible defects in the capital
asset pricing model?
This is a difficult and in some ways a non-intuitive subject. But it is
irresponsible to come to conclusions without reading and discussing the
great mass of statistical and logical evidence.
There may, of course, be macro-economic reasons why industrial investment
should be planned on a short-term basis and high dividends paid out. That
may be an even more important subject for discussion.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The true moral of the QWERTY keyboard is rather different from that
supposed by Michael Prowse (Book Review, June 9). The QWERTY keyboard and
its equivalents in other languages were carefully contrived to minimise
key-jamming on early mechanical typewriters, both by slowing typists down
and by avoiding the need to use neighbouring keys consecutively. The QWERTY
keyboard did not therefore arise by chance. It is an example of the way
solutions tend to outlive problems they were devised to overcome, thereby
becoming problems themselves.

FT  13 JUN 94 / Arts: Britain's lost ballerinas - Anachronistic teaching
threatens our classical dance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Many are called but few are chosen. Children take up ballet, thrilled by
what they may have seen in theatre or on television: in its day, The Red
Shoes did more to inspire young dancers than anything since Anna Pavlova's
world tours. And ballet-training is fine for the young, encouraging a
physical co-ordination which can promote a mental discipline no less
beneficial.
But a career as a dancer in a classical ballet company is vastly different.
The combined rigours of a religious order and Olympic training are
comparable: I do not suppose that either contains quite such obsessive
concern with the minutiae of means, nor such chance of failure.
And yet, despite the implicit hardships, young people decide to try for that
short - often over by the thirties - and far from heady life in ballet. A
recent audition for English National Ballet attracted 500, mostly British,
aspirants. After a first weeding-out, just over 100 remained, and of these
Derek Deane, ENB's artistic director, and his panel of teachers, found not
one dancer suitable for the demands of a company that gives 200 performances
a year. Shock Horror, of course, because Deane has made public issue of a
matter which he believes to have serious implications for his company and
hence for the future of ballet in Britain.
He has been obliged to look to artists in Italy, France and America for the
forthcoming London seasons at the Coliseum and Royal Festival Hall. Deane's
argument, which has caused some much-needed flutterings in ballet's dovecots
where the birds seem unwilling to stretch their wings, concerns a lack of
serious grounding, even of a will to compete in classic ballet.
Technical standards are higher today and, as Deane notes, 'British teachers
don't always take this into account. Dancers are athletes - aesthetic
athletes, maybe, but athletes nonetheless - and training must always bear
this in mind. About half the dancers I took into the company last year
needed re-training so that they did not become injured. With our heavy
work-load, we must have dancers whose physique and abilities can sustain a
very demanding schedule of performance.'
The other problem is psychological rather than physiological. 'Apprentice
dancers in this country also seem shy of ambition, of drive. These are not
qualities of the British temperament. But look at the dancers of the Paris
Opera Ballet, sustained by the brilliance of their technical training, or
consider the American attitude towards dancing with its 'make or break'
belief that one must use one's abilities to the best, or quit.'
Ballet training responds to a national ideal. In the Soviet Union, dance
reflected the demands of the new socialist aesthetic, it was powerful and
yea-saying yet with enormous respect for the great classical past. American
ballet mirrored a faster, more acute and energetic culture. By contrast,
ballet in Britain now seems underpowered.
Over the past decades I have reported with unfailing admiration on the Paris
Opera troupe - the evenings given by Jeunes Danseurs, the Opera School
performances, pinpoint those qualities of professional gloss and security
Deane seeks. In America, New York City Ballet and its School of American
Ballet are the exemplars of brightest skill. Balanchine once said that he
might be 'remembered as a teacher'. The training he initiated and supervised
sought (and found) ideals of clarity, speed, musical acuity, which are as
much part of his genius as his choreography. To dancers in class who were
not driving themselves hard, he would say: 'What are you saving yourself
for?'
Deane has noted a weakness of the 'English' style in ballet nowadays. The
former virtues of classic harmony, ease, have waned. The English manner was
formed under the guidance of Dame Ninette de Valois, whose school and
company were the mainspring of British ballet from the 1930s onwards. She
fostered a style that was elegant, modest and expressive. But it has not
grown with recent years. British dancers now acquire a mixed baggage of
influences from teachers of different schools. Identity seems unclear.
Internationally, there is now a greater emphasis on physical brilliance in
ballet. The arrival of the Bolshoi Ballet in 1955 opened our eyes to a more
exultant way of dancing. Developments since then have encouraged audiences
to ask for greater and more extreme muscular expression from dancers. Some
choreographers make much more searchingly physical, and perhaps athletic,
demands on their interpreters than in the past. Virtuousity is something
audiences always adore and it is not always provided by British dancers.
Comparison with Russia suggests how vital is a coherent system of training.
The schooling shaped by Agrippina Vaganova, the accepted means for ballet
training since Soviet times, from earliest steps to last professional days,
endows the body with exceptional wisdom as well as dignity and physical
power. It explains every movement, justifies every step. A Russian
ballerina, working with ENB a few years ago, said to me: 'Vaganova taught us
how to dance. The girls I see here in class have to learn for themselves.'
Deane's associated concern is with the absence of sufficient financial
support - through grants, funding - for dance training. For a child seeking
a professional dance career, expense can be prohibitive if grants are not
available. A two year course at the ENB's own recently established school,
for example, costs Pounds 30,000. At the Royal Ballet School, our leading
school of classical ballet training, a two year course costs Pounds 16,446.
Inevitably many promising pupils are lost at the financial hurdle.
But, Deane insists, problems really begin at the start of a professional
career 'It is a completely different way of life. You are on your own, and
if you don't have a solid basis of serious work in your body, then you are
in deep trouble.'
'Is dancing difficult?' I once asked Natalya Makarova. 'Oh yes. Very
difficult indeed', was the answer. If it is to be any good, it must be
difficult, as every dancer knows. Not to provide classical dancers -
extraordinary, dedicated beings - with the best skills, and the ability to
use them, is to diminish them, and the art they serve. Deane's comments must
be heeded.
English National Ballet will be appearing at the Coliseum from July 25; and
at the Royal Festival Hall from August 2
Ballet teaching reflects a national ideal. Have we got the classical dance
we deserve? The film that launched a thousand plies: Moira Shearer (far
left) and Ludmilla Tcherina in The Red Shoes (1948). Today, outmoded
teaching, a failure of will and lack of subsidy means British dancers are
losing out, says Derek Deane (left) artistic director of English National
Ballet

FT  13 JUN 94 / Arts: The rivalry that stimulates - Aldeburgh Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Although they were two of the leading composers of their day, Britten and
Stravinsky only exchanged passing glances. A degree of rivalry is evident on
both sides, culminating in Stravinsky's comment about Britten's War Requiem
that he could hardly hear the music for the 'Battle of Britten' chorus of
applause from British critics.
The Aldeburgh Festival has chosen Britten and Stravinsky as this year's
theme. Besides featuring major 20th-century figures who draw audiences, the
pairing affords intellectual stimulation. The post-war period found the two
composers responding to musical trends in very different ways and yet they
so often trod the same ground. Stravinsky himself commented grudgingly, 'I
seem to have shared too many titles and subjects with Mr Britten.'
At Friday's opening concert both composers had to be featured. As the
Stravinsky item Aldeburgh chose The Flood, one of the larger scores from the
composer's neglected later years. This is one of the subjects where the
composers overlap, although the concert (perhaps wisely) did not allow a
direct comparison: Britten's Noye's Fludde is scheduled to be heard later in
the festival.
The Stravinsky has generally been thought a lapse from his usual rigorously
high standards. It was written for television, and a desire for popular
approval (something he envied Britten) may have led to a softening of his
gritty intellect. The story of the flood and Noah's ark - taken in part,
like Britten's, from a Chester miracle play - is told in fast narrative
style, with some wit and copious knowledgeable references for the observant,
yet these favourite Stravinsky traits have been reduced to a lowest common
denominator appeal.
The Flood is difficult to classify. It was staged during Stravinsky's
lifetime (as part opera, part ballet, part play with music) but at Aldeburgh
was given simply as a concert performance. Oliver Knussen conducted the BBC
Symphony Orchestra, crucially making sure all the words could be heard, both
from the soloists and the chorus. The story flashes past as though in a
strip cartoon. One wonders how there would be time to take in visual
distractions as well.
On either side we had two pieces of music for the dead: Mahler's Todtenfeier
(the first version of the opening movement of his Second Symphony) and
Britten's Sinfonia da Requiem - another clever pairing which threw up other
connections, other resonances. The festival promises more
imaginatively-planned concerts in the same vein.

FT  13 JUN 94 / People: Shaky first steps of black empowerment - Nthato
Motlana tells Patti Waldmeir about the challenges facing black business in
the new South Africa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nthato Motlana is South Africa's most prominent black businessmen - and that
is a revealing commentary on the state of black business in the
post-apartheid era.
Motlana is a medical doctor, a decent soul, a man of the best intentions.
But his record as a businessman can scarcely explain the large infusions of
corporate power which he has recently received from white business, eager to
divest itself of peripheral assets in the name of black economic
empowerment.
The recipients have been Motlana and a handful of other black leaders with
the right political connections, but often only a passing experience of
business.
Perhaps they are best seen as caretakers for the new generation of black
businessmen growing up freely in a world without apartheid. But in the
meantime they control several billion rands worth of assets; and at least as
far as Motlana is concerned, his plans for managing the assets remain
difficult to discern.
Motlana is understandably pleased with the recent election of his lifelong
friend and patient, Nelson Mandela (he is Mandela's personal physician) to
the Presidency of the new South Africa.
When I arrived to interview him in the coffee shop of a Johannesburg hotel -
on a public holiday, he has no free time on any other day - Motlana proudly
announces that there is only one member of the new cabinet whom he does not
know well.
His pride would be touching, if that fact were not so much part of the
problem: the suspicion that political expedience prompted his elevation,
that he and other black South Africans (deprived by apartheid of capital,
skills, education and opportunity) could be tempted to peddle political
influence to gain economic power.
Motlana, 69, who has had a long and respected career as a community leader,
has no time for this argument. 'I've been criticised as one of those who is
going to get rich as a result of so-called black economic empowerment.
'My answer to such critics is that I got involved in business in the late
1960s when the (ruling) National Party took a resolution that 'elke kaffir
moet 'n baas he' (every black must have a boss) and that's where we begin.'
Far from accepting that a black man could never be boss, Motlana formed a
series of companies over the past 25 years, yet he does not try to hide the
fact that almost all of these businesses failed. His first company, formed
to manufacture school uniforms, went under because the managing director
stole company funds; the next, a manufacturing firm producing hair products,
detergents and car wash liquid, failed because of lack of management skills.
A venture in chicken farming proved no more successful. 'You have no idea
how much money i've lost,' Motlana concludes.
His only notable success has been the Lesedi Clinic, South Africa's first
private black hospital - and even that had to be bailed out by a white
shareholder, Afrox, which recently took 10 per cent of the equity and a
management contract to prevent its collapse.
This is not to deny the formidable, perhaps insuperable, obstacles which
apartheid put in Motlana's way. 'Everything we did was illegal. Black
business in this country has always had to break the law,' he points out,
reminding the listener that until the 1980s it was virtually impossible for
blacks to obtain property for business use. Banks would not lend in the
absence of collateral - and this was unavailable because under apartheid
blacks were not allowed to own the freehold of their homes.
He is understandably proud of his achievement in conducting any business at
all under those circumstances. 'I hate people who say to me, you are
empowered by politics, because I'm not] I battled at the coal face when it
was almost impossible to do so.
'So don't talk to me about black economic empowerment because I don't come
from that bloody genre, I come from a time when it was impossible and I did
it] That's where I come from, not from some bloody political patronage]'
But the challenges facing Motlana now are of a wholly different order. Last
year he became chairman of Methold, a black-owned holding company.
The Afrikaans insurance giant Sanlam recently granted Methold a controlling
stake in Metropolitan Life, an insurance company which targets mainly
blacks. It was one of the first major corporate deals to empower black South
Africans.
As part of the deal, Sanlam ceded control to Methold, which borrowed R137m
from the state's Industrial Development Corporation to finance the purchase
of 10 per cent of MetLife shares. But Methold is struggling to place the
shares with black shareholders, who lack the capital or inclination for
share purchases.
Motlana is also chairman of Corporate Africa, his chief investment vehicle.
It controls the largest black newspaper, the Sowetan, after Anglo American
Corp, which previously controlled the Sowetan indirectly, ceded a majority
stake to Motlana and other black leaders.
The deal was financed via Corporate Africa's stake in the cellular telephone
network MTN, which it gained in turn through political pressure.
All these deals have been criticised for empowering the black elite far more
than the man in the Soweto black taxi, whom Motlana claims to represent.
An amiable man clearly unused to tough questioning, Motlana becomes
increasingly strident when confronted with this charge; but he lacks a
convincing defence.
'You can ask, what value does Motlana add to any of these businesses,' says
a local businessman involved in one of the deals. 'The answer is not a lot.
But then you have to ask: who else is there?' Apartheid not only stifled
black business, it prevented the emergence of natural leaders.
And that is precisely what Motlana wants to rectify. 'We're interested not
in some token director like Motlana who sits on the board, but in seeing
upward mobility of blacks within organisations, that's where the real power
is,' says Motlana.
'Sometimes we speak of black economic empowerment and we demand total
control . . .that is unrealistic. We lack the financial muscle . . .the
management skills . . .all manner of things we have been denied for many
years. I'm looking forward to companies where we have a van der Merwe and a
Khumalo (typical Afrikaner and African names).
'You can call it tokenism if you like, but it's going to be the story of
South Africa: van der Merwe and Khumalo. The Afrikaners did the same thing;
when the National Party took over in 1948, it was Levine and Kruger. The
banks in South Africa were all run by English men; today most of the major
banks are run by Afrikaners.'
Motlana's vision of a South Africa run by Africans is scarcely consoling to
whites: 'For the first time we blacks are going to sit back and employ
whites and see them sweat on our behalf' - hardly a sentiment which his
patron, Nelson Mandela, would endorse.
But whatever Motlana's other shortcomings, he can boast perhaps the most
essential quality of a successful businessmen: the desire to get rich. He
quotes Chinese leader Deng Xiao Ping approvingly: 'It is glorious to be
rich. That's my favourite quotation.
'I'm looking forward to the creation of black Donny Gordons (founder
chairman of the highly successful Liberty Life, the South African insurer).'
If Motlana can foster the creation of younger versions of the rich and
flamboyant tycoon, he will have done his bit for the new South Africa.

FT  13 JUN 94 / Business Travel: Travel at your own risk in China
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The strains of travel in China have become a rich source of anecdotes, and
more than a few apocryphal tales are exchanged by jaded businessmen.
Among the more recent 'horror' stories was one involving a McDonnell Douglas
MD82 on a flight from Hong Kong to Qingdao on the coast south-east of
Beijing. Passengers were alarmed when the pilot of the Eastern Airlines
aircraft tilted the wings from one side to the other in an apparent attempt
to get fuel running smoothly to the engines.
Travellers in China become used to delays in an overloaded network, but they
also require nerves of steel. A New Zealand businessman reported that an
aircraft in which he was travelling earlier this year made four abortive
attempts to take off, before giving up.
Passengers are also obliged to endure faulty landings and other mishaps that
would be rare in the west. A Chinese safety study found that in the first
five months of this year there were 17 such mishaps, including wings
scraping the ground on landing.
Hijackings are another problem: travellers over China's southern coastal
regions stand a fair chance of making an unscheduled detour to Taiwan. Last
year, there were no fewer than 10 hijackings to Taiwan.

FT  13 JUN 94 / Business Travel: Vision of winged giants - Plans for
600-seater superjumbos
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The world's two biggest commercial aircraft manufacturers, Boeing of the US
and the European Airbus consortium, are stepping up studies to develop a
generation of superjumbos, capable of seating 600 or more passengers.
Mr Jean Pierson, Airbus chief executive, confirmed this month that the
European group would soon start marketing a 600-seat aircraft - the A3XX -
to a selected group of international airlines.
This new project would challenge Boeing's dominance of the large aircraft
market with its 747-400 jumbo, which can already seat 450 to 500. But Boeing
is also at an advanced stage of studies to build an even larger jumbo:
either a new aircraft or a bigger derivative of the 747.
At the same time, Boeing and Airbus are jointly studying the development of
an even larger aircraft seating more than 800, in the so-called Very Large
Capacity Transport (VLCT) project.
Although the airline industry has yet to recover its financial health, the
manufacturers believe there will be demand for a large aircraft by the turn
of the century. 'By around 2002, airlines will have to consider replacing
their existing 747-400 fleets,' says Mr Pierson. More significantly, a big
aircraft will also be necessary to cope with air traffic growth and
increasing congestion at busy airports.
'Already only 33 airports account for 50 per cent of world air traffic,'
explains Mr Claude Terrazzoni, the head of the commercial aircraft division
of Aerospatiale, the French aerospace group with a 37.9 per cent stake in
Airbus.
So far only two big airlines have expressed strong interest in acquiring
superjumbos. 'We would be willing to go forward with an aircraft of 600
seats offering the same long range but also 20 per cent lower operating
costs than the 747-400,' says Sir Colin Marshall, British Airways chairman.
A superjumbo would help BA tackle some of the growing runway congestion
problems at its London base of Heathrow. But it would also give the UK
carrier the opportunity to offer more facilities for both business and
economy passengers.
BA has already made its own design studies for the configuration of such an
aircraft, including the introduction of inflight business offices equipped
with faxes, telephones and personal computers, a cinema-style inflight
entertainment room, and even a work-out section for fitness addicts.
'We see the use for such an aircraft on Far East routes, Australasia
services and across the Atlantic,' Sir Colin explains.
Singapore Airlines has also expressed strong interest. Mr J Y Pillay, the
Singapore Airline Group chairman, recently said his carrier would initially
buy five superjumbos to serve routes to the UK and continental Europe as
well as trans-Pacific routes and - if it secured the necessary rights -
across the Atlantic from London.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
An explosion on Saturday caused a serious fire in a rail tunnel being built
under the Great Belt waterway between Denmark's main islands at the mouth of
the Baltic.
Storebaelt A/S (Great Belt), the construction group responsible for the
project, said the fire lasted eight hours before being brought under
control.
The tunnel is part of a 20bn crown (Dollars 3bn) road/rail/tunnel/bridge
link between Zealand island and the European mainland, via Funen.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Signalling staff employed by Railtrack, the body which runs the
infrastructure of the British railway system, are threatening a strike for
this Wednesday.
RMT, the union which represents the staff involved in the pay dispute, said
further talks were due to be held today. However, union officials said much
of the goodwill built up in recent talks had been squandered.
The signalling staff voted for 24-hour strikes on June 15 and June 22.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
President Clinton has cut off US commercial air traffic to Haiti and imposed
a ban on financial transactions in a bid to further isolate Haiti's military
rulers and force them to step down.
Canada also said that it would halt commercial flights to Haiti on the same
day the US does: June 25. France, the Dominican Republic, Panama and the
Netherlands also have flights to Port-au-Prince.
In retaliation Haiti's military-backed government said it would close the
country's airport to all flights five days before the ban goes into effect.

FT  13 JUN 94 / Business Travel: How to stay as safe and secure as you can -
Tony Walker offers guidelines for a trip to China
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Travel in China these days is not a tea party, as late Chairman Mao Zedong
said of the revolution. The crash last week near the historic city of Xian
of a Russian-built Tupolev-154, killing all 160 passengers, did nothing for
already shaky confidence in China's air safety.
Visitors to China might follow some fairly basic guidelines to improve the
odds of surviving their expedition. The first is to avoid Russian-built
planes, which comprise about 10-15 per cent of China's domestic fleet of
some 350 aircraft, spread among 30 or so airlines.
Mr David Mahon of Mahon and Associates, a China business consultancy, says
that in scheduling flights for clients he avoids Russian Antonovs, Ilyushins
and Tupolevs. On the occasions when a passenger finds that a Russian-built
aircraft has been substituted for a Boeing or an Airbus, Mr Mahon's advice
is to walk away, await another flight or seek alternative means of travel.
To prepare for last-minute changes of plan, travel light: in other words,
try to restrict luggage to 'carry-on' items.
Risks of travel in China, where more than 500 have died in some half dozen
crashes since 1992, mean that help on the ground is virtually a necessity.
Agents abroad might lack expertise in local conditions. Ticket confirmation
is also difficult to arrange at a distance, given the chaotic Chinese
aircraft booking systems.
China consultants are also recommending these days that their clients travel
first class, since escape may be easier from the less crowded forward
compartment. In selecting regional airlines, choose carriers with
established reputations, such as China Eastern from Shanghai and China
Southern from Guangzhou. Airlines based in remote regions should be avoided
where possible.
Western aviation experts attribute China's bad air safety record to the
increase in airlines: there are not enough experienced pilots and
maintenance staff to go round. Air traffic guidance systems are also
inadequate.
In addition, many airports have not been designed to receive jets which
require greater length of runway than propeller-drive aircraft. Pilots come
into land hard and fast, as if they want to get the process over and done
with.
Travellers to China have a range of options other than air travel. But again
arrangements are hard to make at a distance.
Ferries are a reasonably pleasant and secure means of travel between coastal
cities, such as Shanghai and Ningbo in the south, or Dalian to Tianjin or
Qingdao in the north - provided you can secure first or second-class
accommodation. 'Soft sleeper' or 'soft seat' - as opposed to 'hard' - rail
travel is another method of getting around China, although the process is
slow.
Road travel is another option; but because of congested roads - there are
few expressways - and anarchic driving, it can be nerve-wracking. Hotels
will assist in choosing a car and driver.
No means of Chinese travel these days is especially appealing, and is
unlikely to be so for years to come. In China, business is not easy, and
neither is getting from A to B.

FT  13 JUN 94 / People (Names in the News): Skinner on brink of huge power
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pacific Gas and Electric's carefully laid plans for management succession
called for Stanley Skinner, president and chief operating officer, to take
over as chief executive a year from now, writes Louise Kehoe. Instead,
Skinner will move into the top job at America's biggest power utility next
month.
By accelerating its plans, PG&amp;E aims to give its new chief executive a head
start on what may be one of the most difficult periods in the history of the
company as California moves to deregulate its electricity supply industry.
Skinner, 56, will succeed Richard Clarke, 64, who will remain chairman of
the board.
'The next few years will produce greater change than we have seen in the
last 10 or 15 years combined,' says Clarke.
A recent proposal by the independent California Public Utilities Commission
aims to reduce electricity prices by creating a competitive market. The plan
calls for all electricity users in the state, including residential
customers, to be allowed to buy electricity from the supplier of their
choice by the year 2002. It also establishes a streamlined,
performance-based rate-setting system.
PG&amp;E, which has long operated its electricity supply operations as a
regulated monopoly in many parts of California, is about to go through the
same kind of upheaval that has reshaped the US telecommunications industry
over the past decade.
Skinner will play a pioneering role in managing the transition to
deregulation in the US electricity industry. California's plans for
deregulation of energy utilities are advanced, and other states are expected
to follow its lead.

FT  13 JUN 94 / People (Names in the News): Ponzellini moves to EIB
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM HALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Jacques de Larosiere's European Bank for Reconstruction and Development has
been raided for a second time, writes William Hall. Less than three months
after Mario Sarcinelli, number three in the EBRD, left to head Banca
Nazionale del Lavoro, the European Investment Bank has poached another EBRD
high flier.
Massimo Ponzellini, 43, who helped set up the EBRD and heads its tourism and
real estate department, is the youngest of three new recruits to the EIB's
top management committee. The others are Luis Marti, 57, an adviser to
Spain's ministry of economy and finance, and Panagiotis-Loukas Gennimatas,
45, a senior adviser in the Bank of Greece.
The EIB lends roughly ten times as much as the EBRD and Ponzellini will be
one of the six vice-presidents reporting to Sir Brian Unwin, the EIB's new
president. The intention is that the EIB's vice-presidents will have an
increased hands-on role.
Ponzellini is a former personal assistant to Romano Prodi, a fellow Bolognan
who has just handed in his notice as chairman of IRI, Italy's huge
debt-ridden state holding company. Much of Ponzellini's early career was
spent in various parts of IRI but at the EBRD he has made his mark by
pioneering project-related lending and taking equity stakes.
'The challenge at the EIB will be to get closer to the private sector,' says
Ponzellini, who hopes that as one of the few bankers at the top of the
organisation, he can help revitalise an institution which in terms of
balance sheet size is bigger than the World Bank.

FT  13 JUN 94 / People (Names in the News): 'English' Frenchman to head
Unice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Francois Perigot is the first Frenchman to take over the presidency of the
increasingly important European employers' body Unice. writes David
Goodhart. Unice has a vital lobbying role in Brussels and in areas like the
European social dimension it even has a formal negotiating status.
As these responsibilities have grown so has the potential for tension within
Unice between the business cultures of different European countries,
especially between the aggressive tone of Britain's employers and the
consensual manners of much of continental Europe.
Domestically, Perigot is regarded as a liberal and was roundly condemned,
even by other businessman, for suggesting that a GATT agreement might be
good for French business. 'That earned him his spurs and really clinched the
Unice job,' says one senior Unice member.
He is also happy to take a tough line against the European Commission on
issues like the imposition of European works councils in multinational
companies. And having spent 15 years of his working life at Unilever -
running both the Spanish and French subsidiaries - he is more than familiar
with British business culture. 'He is virtually an English Frenchman,' says
his friend Howard Davies, head of the Confederation of British Industry.
But the golf-playing Perigot may not always see eye-to-eye with the CBI.
Last week he was quoted in the French business daily Les Echos as saying
that the European social dimension 'is both substantial and positive' - a
sentiment to which few British business leaders would put their names.
In any case, Perigot is well versed in the politics of employers'
organisations; since 1986 he has been president of the main French
employers' body CNPF, a job he is not expected to continue for long.

FT  13 JUN 94 / Survey of Design in Europe (13): Kompan's playgrounds in
demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hans Mogens Frederiksen and Tom Lindhardt Wils were men with a mission when
they founded Kompan in Denmark in 1970. Rejecting the concrete bleakness of
the 1960s children's outdoor playground, they demanded colour, excitement
and play value.
They were clearly on to something. Kompan is now the world's leading
producer of playground equipment with an annual turnover of DKr500m, 90 per
cent of which is exported through sales to 40 countries. Strong bright
colours and bold clear shapes make its equipment instantly recognisable. And
the accolades have come flooding in, culminating in one of the 1994 EC
Design Prizes.
Flemming Aggergaard, managing director of Kompan International, emphasises
that design has been 'fundamental' to the company's success. He says the
challenge is to link the aesthetic and fun with the stimulating and
educational - while ensuring that 'look' is never promoted above safety.
Safety, play value and quality are the watchwords.
Kompan looks at the world with a child's eye. 'We try to understand what
happens when children play. We work to find products which further their
intellectual and social needs,' says Aggergaard. Child education experts
have been involved in product development from the start. The emphasis is on
primary colours and organic shapes. Much of the equipment is spring-loaded
and as much as possible is made from wood.
But he is conscious of the competitive threats - manufacturing barriers to
entry are low and the group's products are expensive. Hence the stress on
'concept' as much as 'product' and the attention given to the whole chain of
activity from planning to after-sales service. The group even helps to
arrange insurance - a big item in markets such as the US.
Kompan has done more than simply transform the look of playgrounds and shift
emphasis from physical prowess to social interaction. Aggergaard notes
approvingly the subtle shift in customers' attitudes from 'what can we get
for the kids' to 'what would be good for the kids.'
Kompan's important selling tools are its child development seminars. The
aim, says Aggergaard, is to 'explain to customers why we are doing things as
we are.'

<TEXT>
There was a time when the only real attraction for architecture enthusiasts
visiting the Basle region was Le Corbusier's Chapelle Notre-Dame-du-Haut at
Ronchamp.
These days there is another: the extraordinary collection of contemporary
architecture commissioned by Vitra, the Swiss office furniture company, at
its production plant in Weil-am-Rhein across the German border, for which it
has been awarded one of this year's EC Design Prizes.
The Weil site - which includes factories by Nicholas Grimshaw and Alvaro
Siza, the museum designed by Frank Gehry, Tadao Ando's conference centre and
the expressionistic flurry of Zaha Hadid's fire station - attracts 40,000
visitors a year, many of whom make a special trip to see it.
Vitra opened yet another landmark building last month when it moved into its
new headquarters designed by Frank Gehry in a Basle suburb.
There is a commercial sub-text to Vitra's architectural passion. The
company, which was founded as a shopfitter in the 1930s, was the European
manufacturer for Hermann Miller, the US furniture group, until 1984.
It has since made its own way in the office furniture field by working with
freelance designers such as Mario Bellini, Philippe Starck and Jasper
Morrison.
The publicity generated by its buildings, together with the fact that many
of the people trooping around the Weil site are architects who could
eventually become customers, has undoubtedly helped Vitra to establish
itself as an independent entity. Rolf Fehlbaum, the chairman, who initiated
the construction programme after the old factory was damaged by fire in
1981, is convinced that Vitra's employees have also benefited - not only
from working in a visually stimulating environment, but from liaising with
different architects.
He sees the collaborative experience as a valuable complement to Vitra's
'trial and error' approach to working with its own designers.
'A project like this isn't a folly or fantasy, it's part of the company's
culture,' he says. 'It's a financially feasible project with practical
benefits that also send a clear message to our customers.'
The company's financial figures corroborate his analysis.
Since the break with Hermann Miller the company has quadrupled its turnover
from SFr56m in 1984 to SFr210m last year. Its success in this year's
European Union Design Prize is indicative of its status in the design
sphere.
Vitra is now moving in a new direction, developing new office systems to
take account of the technological changes which are transforming working
patterns. It has also called a halt to its architectural schemes.
'We don't need any more buildings,' says Rolf Fehlbaum. 'Not now, at least.'

FT  13 JUN 94 / Survey of Design in Europe (14): 'We shall act as the glue'
 -Changes in design policy in several EU member states
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the UK government last autumn announced a radical reform for the Design
Council it marked the end of an era for British design policy.
It also heralded the beginning of a dynamic, new design initiative which, so
the government hopes, will meet the needs of UK industry into the next
century.
The UK is not the only European country to have implemented sweeping changes
in design policy. The Dutch government last year launched a new Netherlands
Design Institute. The French system is in a state of flux as the Agence pour
la Promotion de la Creation Industrielle (APCI) attempts to redefine its
role following the withdrawal of the state's support. Even the European
Commission is considering ways of modernising its design strategy.
Each country - or institution, in the EC's case - has tailored its approach
according to its own needs, but it is possible to identify common strands in
the new public sector design policies of the 1990s.
The old design promotion organisations were, typically for the post-war
period, vertically-integrated bodies with large staffs and an
interventionist style. The new breed tend to favour a more flexible approach
by operating on a small scale as catalysts between the design community and
other areas of the economy.
They also tend to be more tightly focused towards industry than their
predecessors, which also often had the philanthropic aim of raising design
awareness among the public.
'Our aim is to create an inspirational organisation,' says John Sorrell,
chairman of Newell &amp; Sorrell, the corporate identity design consultancy, who
has orchestrated the reform of the UK's Design Council as its chairman.
'We're going to act as the glue between the UK's designers, its design
infrastructure and industry.'
The creation of the new Design Council has been a complex and painful
process - although it is indicative of the depth of the government's
commitment to the project that it allowed John Sorrell to map out a
blueprint for a new body rather than simply abolishing the old one. The old
Design Council, which employed 250 people with activities ranging from
conference management to magazine publishing, is now being pared down to a
new body with a staff of 50, Many of the old activities will be
sub-contracted to external specialists.
Mr Sorrell, who is determined that the new Design Council will be 'faster on
its feet and more visible' than its predecessor, also plans to co-opt
'guerrilla groups' of designers and industrialists for specific projects. He
has started with a series of research initiatives  - including an analysis
of design's effectiveness in industry and an overview of the government's
use of design - which will mark the launch later this year of the new Design
Council on the 50th anniversary of the original body.
The new Netherlands Design Institute has also cast itself in a catalytic
role. It was founded 18 months ago as part of an overhaul of Dutch arts
strategy which also led to the foundation of similar organisations in
parallel fields including photography.
John Thackara, the institute's director, sees the organisation as a
'facilitator' to build bridges between the Dutch design community and other
fields, notably industry and the arts. He and his team have already liaised
with external consultants to identity centres of excellence in Dutch design,
such as graphics and typography. They are now initiating projects, again in
liaison with external specialists, to facilitate the future development of
those areas particularly in the fields of new technology and multi-media.
While the UK and the Netherlands stride forward into the future, the French
are still trying to find a new direction for design policy. Until recently
the Association pour la Promotion de la Creation Industrielle, a public
sector body funded by the culture ministry, was the linchpin of design
promotion in France. Its most notable recent project was last summer's
controversial Design: Mirror of the Century exhibition of 20th century
design at the Grand Palais in Paris.
However, the APCI's influence was steadily eroded in the late 1980s, as the
then socialist government set up a series of regional design centres linked
to local business bodies such as chambers of commerce. These new centres are
more concerned with the business community than the APCI which, under the
influence of the culture ministry, tended to concentrate on artistic
initiatives aimed at the public, rather than industry.
The current conservative government withdrew its funding from the APCI
earlier this year, which was then threatened with closure. The association
has since managed to secure the support of the Paris Chamber of Commerce and
is now assessing its future under its new, more commercially-minded patron.
Meanwhile the European Commission is revising its design policy to ensure
that it plays a complementary role to the raft of national and regional
bodies. Its design activities come under the aegis of Sprint - alias the
Strategic Programme for Innovation and Technology Transfer - within DG13,
the part of the commission which is responsible for innovation and
telecommunications.
The focus of the EC's design activities has since the late 1980s been the
European Community Design Prize, which is intended to encourage small and
medium-sized companies to make the most of design as a competitive tool. The
prize was introduced in 1988 and is awarded every two years. The latest
prizes were awarded last Friday at a ceremony in Amsterdam to Kompan, the
Danish children's playground equipment manufacturer, Luceplan, the Italian
lighting company, and Vitra, the Swiss office furniture group which has its
main manufacturing base in Germany.
The aim of the prize, according to Antonio Doronzo, head of Sprint's design
projects, is to reward small and medium-sized companies for achieving
'all-round excellence in design'. The winners must demonstrate that they
have reached the highest possible standards of design in their products,
communications activities and the environment of their operations. These
companies can then be used by the Sprint team as role models for others to
follow.
Mr Doronzo is now looking at ways of expanding the European Commission's
design activities. He envisages the prize continuing to be the focus of its
design promotion effort for the foreseeable future, although he is
interested in broadening its ambit possibly to include young companies that
are using design as catalysts for growth.
'We have been considering lots of different roles for the commission in
design promotion as we do think we could make more effort in this area,'
says Doronzo. 'But design is a complex subject. We're well aware of that and
are very anxious not to impose a single view across the European Union when
design can mean very different things in different countries.'

FT  13 JUN 94 / Survey of Design in Europe (12): Luceplan's designs stand
the test of time
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Family has long loomed large in Italian industry, but it played a very
special part in the creation of Luceplan during the late 1970s.
The three founders - Riccardo Sarfatti, Sandra Severi Cristalli and Paolo
Rizzatto - met while studying architecture at university. They went on to
work together at Arteluce, a lighting company owned by Sarfatti's father,
until it was bought by Flos, the bastion of Italian lighting. They stayed
there for a while before leaving to start on their own.
Luceplan is now Italy's third largest lighting company. Its annual turnover
is almost L20bn (70 per cent of which is exported) and it has 55 employees
at its Milan factory. Yet the three founders and Alberto Meda, the fourth
partner, think their real achievement is that all the 20 lights they have
produced since the 1970s are still on the market - proof of a commitment to
design that has earned one of this year's EC Design Prizes.
It can seem cliched when companies wax lyrical about design being an
integral part of their business, but it happens to be true for Luceplan.
Where other Italian lighting companies work with external designers - as
Flos does, for example, with Achille Castiglioni, Philippe Starck and Marc
Newson - the Luceplan partners stick to the Bauhaus model of designing all
their own products alongside their factory production team.
'We don't believe it is possible to have a design studio in one place and a
factory in another,' says Paulo Rizzatto. 'We are dealing with very complex
products which require a high level of technical expertise. It is essential
that the design and production process is homogeneous.'
This commitment to homogeneity is best exemplified by Luceplan's
headquarters: a complex of five early 20th century warehouses, specially
converted to accommodate product development, manufacturing and
distribution.
The partners also co-ordinate the design of all Luceplan's packaging and
publicity material to ensure that it conveys the correct image.
Until recently the company concentrated on domestic lighting, but its latest
venture marks a new departure into heavy duty lights for public spaces such
as apartment blocks. The catalyst, Riccardo Sarfatti says, was the
realisation that existing products in that market were not only of low
quality, but also had failed to take advantage of the development of
technically advanced light bulbs.
Luceplan's response was to devote 30 months - and a tenth of its turnover -
to developing the Metrop. After a year on the market it has already sold
20,000 units and recouped the investment.

FT  13 JUN 94 / Survey of Design in Europe (7): The family dog goes out of
fashion - John Ridding finds renewed competitiveness and flair in European
car design
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Mr Patrick Le Quement, head of design at Renault, sought to persuade
the company chairman to go ahead with the Twingo, he told him that he
planned to develop a car which would 'put the family dog out of fashion.'
One year after the launch of the quirky mini-car, 200,000 of man's best
friends may be wondering whether to seek a new kennel.
The commercial success of the Twingo is evidence of a renaissance of
innovation, and a degree of risk-taking, at the French state-owned car
group. But it also stands as a symbol of a renewed competitiveness of
European car design after a period of assault by international rivals.
'There are some very attractive products at the moment,' says Mr Le Quement,
citing the Opel Corsa, the curvy small car which is devoid of straight
lines. For Professor Dan Jones at the University of Cardiff business school,
the Vauxhall Calibra is another triumph. 'It got them away from the sales
rep image,' he says. 'They have got an awful lot of mileage from the car.'
Mr Roy Axe, managing director of Design Research Associates, the independent
consultancy group, commends Rover, with its emphasis on British
characteristics, BMW, and Mercedes.
For many in the industry, the emergence of products such as the Twingo and
the new Rover range marks a welcome response to the threat of international
competitors - particularly from the Japanese constructors - and the end of a
period of self doubt in European car design.
'Europe held the leadership in auto design until the 1980s, and then in the
late 1980s the Japanese seized it by being more adventurous,' says Professor
Jones. Mr Le Quement concurs. 'The Japanese took over and captivated the
interest of the whole industry. The Europeans went through a patch of
desperation and many felt they would never see better days,' he says,
referring to the succession of concept cars developed by the Japanese in the
1980s and their success in penetrating traditional strongholds of European
design, such as the sports car segment.
That, however, was then. 'Today the situation has changed significantly,'
says the Renault design chief. 'We feel that we have not been beaten by
psychological warfare.'
The reversal of fortunes is partly explained through the adoption of lessons
learned from the Japanese themselves. In particular, European manufacturers
have implemented team-based design techniques, resulting in increased
efficiency and reduced costs through the combination of styling and
engineering processes in the development of new models. The Europeans have
still not caught up with their eastern rivals in this area, but the gap has
narrowed, allowing broader ranges of vehicles and greater responsiveness to
customer tastes.
The increased design competitiveness of many European manufacturers also
reflects their adoption of a strategy of emphasising the distinctiveness of
their particular products, rather than attempting to appeal to the broadest
possible number of consumers. As the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
warned in its book The Future of the Automobile: 'It is clear that product
distinctiveness is the major competitive advantage of the European
producers, and they will lose it only at great risk.'
This thinking is clear in the case of the Twingo. 'It is better to adopt a
strategy of pleasing wholeheartedly a smaller number of people than to try
and avoid displeasing everyone,' says Mr Le Quement, dismissing the idea of
a world car which can suit all tastes. 'That is a myth, like Euro-camembert
or Euro beer,' he says.
Part of this strategy involves an emphasis on nationalism in design. Rover's
renewed success, for example, is partly the result of an emphasis on its
Britishness, from the wooden dashboards to the regal grille on the front of
its more recent cars. The quirkiness of the Twingo also harks back to a
tradition of French innovation, from the Renault 16 - the first car to have
a modular interior - to the Citroen DS, the shark-like saloon with
swivelling headlights, hydraulic suspension and steering.
'We took the approach of re-establishing our design as a French manufacturer
rather than a Euro manufacturer,' says Mr Le Quement. 'We believe the
richness of the culture is what makes Europe and we reject the idea of
trying to do the best average.'
Not all constructors agree. Ford of the US, for example, is a strong
advocate of the world car, designed to appeal to a mass international market
and achieve huge economies of production. 'If the Ford approach works then
it is frightening,' says Mr Le Quement.
Notwithstanding this challenge, however, the increased diversity of European
design deprives international rivals of a unified target. 'In the 1980s
Europe was drawn towards a standardised product line, off which were
developed different versions. The result was that cars became similar and
boring and presented an easy opportunity for the Japanese', says Professor
Jones. The Miata MX5 sports car, and the Toyota Lexus, aimed to compete with
Mercedes and BMWs, came as a 'profound shock' to the European producers, he
says.
But if the Europeans have been strengthened by a more adventurous approach
to design, the battle is not yet won. The Americans, and Chrysler in
particular, are becoming increasingly competitive. 'The Japanese reached a
kind of a plateau,' says Mr Axe of DRA. 'They need to find a focus again,
and I am sure they will.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Hotel New York, a new hotel which opened last summer in the 19th century
headquarters of the Holland-America shipping company on a stunning waterside
site in Rotterdam harbour, is the choice of Stefano Marzano, design director
of Philips, the Dutch electronics group.
'It's completely different from any other luxury hotel,' he says. 'It's
impossible to go there without thinking of the history of the
Holland-America line and of all the people who left their homes in Europe
from there to go to a new life in America. You can almost hear their voices
in the rooms.
'It's also important because it's the centre of the redevelopment of the Kop
Van Zuid area, so it's a real link between Rotterdam's past and its future.'

The prototype for the iconoclastic MuZ Skorpion motorbike, developed for MuZ
of eastern Germany by Seymour Powell, the London-based product designers,
was chosen by Paul Smith, the British fashion designer.
'I love the utilitarian feeling about the bike,' he says. 'It's amazing that
MuZ, an eastern German company previously looked upon as the Lada of the
bike world, could have come up with such a revolutionary design. It weighs
less at 500cc than most Japanese 250cc bikes.
'It's glued together, not welded, and has 30 per cent fewer parts than
equivalent Japanese bikes. It was the star of the last Bike show in

FT  13 JUN 94 / Survey of Design in Europe (6): Industry prepares to enter a
new phase - Alice Rawsthorn finds cautious confidence among design
consultants in the aftermath of recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is a modest, though unmistakable air of optimism among Europe's design
consultancies as the industry slowly but steadily emerges from recession.
Design - the business which expanded so rapidly in the 1980s, has had a
gruelling time in the early 1990s. Some of the industry's best known names
have disappeared in a maelstrom of takeovers, receiverships and
redundancies. But the economic tide is now turning. The design business in
most European countries is coming out of the doldrums and is poised for
recovery.
'We've been through a hellish period,' says Martin Beck, chairman of Fitch,
the London-based retail design business which was forced to mount an
emergency financial restructuring in 1992. 'But the worst is over. Business
is more buoyant and there is so much pent-up demand in the European design
market that the long term prospects are excellent.'
As the industry prepares to enter a new phase in its fortunes, the critical
questions are whether the recession has wrought long term changes in its
structure, and which type of consultancies will be best placed to benefit
from the expansion of the European design market in the future.
Perhaps the most accurate illustration of the scale of the changes within
the industry is the annual league table compiled by Design Week magazine in
the UK (arguably Europe's most mature design market, but also the base for
most of the consultancies operating on a European basis.) Design Week
recorded a steady decline in the fee income of the 100 largest consultancies
in 1990, 1991 and 1992 until 1993, when it registered a 2 per cent increase
to Pounds 307m.
Yet last year's increase means that the 100 largest consultancies are still
earning considerably less than in the peak year of 1989, when their combined
fee income totalled Pounds 429m.
Furthermore, the Design Week survey suggests that the bigger businesses have
borne the brunt of the recession. The number of companies employing over 100
designers has fallen from 19 in 1991 to eight today. The fastest growing
consultancies are those employing 25 to 49 people.
At first glance, the contraction of the big design groups appears to reverse
one of the key themes of the industry during the 1980s - the transformation
of strong, local design consultancies into European networks working in
different countries across the continent.
In the past, international design projects tended to be the province of high
profile individuals who had formed close personal relationships with their
clients. The new breed of retail, packaging and corporate identity
consultancies were working on a larger scale. They mimicked the advertising
industry by opening offices and studios to sell their services and implement
projects across Europe. The leading US consultancies such as Landor, part of
the Young &amp; Rubicam marketing group, and Siegel &amp; Gale, a Saatchi &amp; Saatchi
subsidiary, also expanded their European operations.
The rigours of the recession forced some companies to freeze their European
expansion plans; others closed their new offices and studios. The
multinational marketing services groups, such as Euro-RSCG of France and the
UK's WPP, streamlined their design interests by merging some of their
subsidiaries.
The industry now faces the dilemma of deciding how to service its
international clients in the future. The market for multinational projects
remained reasonably buoyant throughout the recession: indeed, some UK
consultancies could not have survived otherwise. The market also has
considerable long term growth potential as the activities of the design
industry's clients become increasingly international.
'We have no choice but to be a European business,' says Brian Boylan, deputy
chairman of Woolf Olins, the London-based corporate identity consultancy.
'It isn't simply a question of picking up new jobs outside the UK. Our UK
clients are nearly all international companies and we can't do our work for
them properly unless we operate in a European context.'
Perhaps the most useful lesson of the recession was that the industry's
finances are too fragile to support advertising agency-style networks of
offices and studios. It is instructive that one of the few large London
consultancies to have expanded steadily during the recession is Pentagram,
which has always stuck stubbornly to its original concept of operating as a
co-operative of individual designers. 'It's no secret how we've done it,'
says John McConnell, a partner. 'It's because we stuck to our guns and
resisted the temptation to expand in the 1980s.'
The new consultancies which have sprung up in the early 1990s have adopted a
similarly prudent policy. One new area of design to have emerged in the
recession is branding, or brand development, which has grown out of the
packaging design business and spawned dynamic young consultancies such as
Scott Libby Heming and Wickens Tutt Southgate, both of which are based in
London but are already executing European projects.
'We saw what happened to the design groups which expanded aggressively in
the 1980s,' says Mark Wickens, a founder of Wickens Tutt Southgate. 'We're
absolutely committed to expansion in Europe but we'll do it in a much more
focused way.'
Meanwhile, the established consultancies have pared down their operations
and are now operating in Europe on a more flexible basis. 'It's horses for
courses,' says Brian Boylan of Wolff Olins. 'We've thought long and hard
about how to handle international projects. The fact is, we don't have
stereotypical clients, so we can't offer them standard solutions. We've got
to be flexible.'
Woolf Olins still has an office in Spain and has formed associations with
local companies in Italy and Portugal. But it services its German and
Scandinavian clients from its London headquarters. Similarly, Landor Europe
operates across the continent from full-scale offices in London and Paris,
with satellite operations in Madrid and Milan.
This flexible approach to European design projects may last longer than the
industry expected. This is partly because of the changes in the industry's
relationship with its clients. The financial pressures of recession, coupled
with the changes within mass-marketing, have prompted many large
multinational companies to reassess the way they work with external
suppliers, including design consultancies.
Some companies have set up internal design departments to co-ordinate their
design activities. These departments often handle the implementational side
of projects, leaving external consultancies to concentrate on the conceptual
and advisory side of design and thereby reducing the need for large local
teams of people working on the ground with clients.
Similarly, advances in technology have reduced the cost and complexity of
orchestrating cross-border projects from different countries. Fitch uses
video conferencing and modems to link its US and European offices. Its
employees also use the Internet to communicate among themselves and with
their clients. Fitch is putting its own experience with new technology into
practise by diversifying into new multi-media fields such as home shopping
systems.
'Technology will play a central role in the future of the design industry,'
says Martin Beck. 'In some respects the newer firms have an advantage over
the older companies because they are starting fresh with technology at the
core of their business.'

FT  13 JUN 94 / Survey of Design in Europe (8): The brightest and best stand
up to be counted - Alice Rawsthorn asks some influential designers to choose
one item each from the galaxy of products
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Despite all the warnings about maturing markets and sated consumers, each
year thousands of new products are still launched. Some will last. Others
will not. The FT asked some of the most influential figures in European
design to choose one example of imaginative and intelligent design which is
already - or is about to be - available in Europe.
Philippe Starck, the French architect and designer, plumps for Concept 1,
the car Volkswagen of Germany is considering for a launch in the mid-1990s
as a successor to the old Beetle. 'It's something really extraordinary -
warm and friendly,' says Starck. 'Design today isn't about making something
that people gasp at and say 'Ah] How beautiful.' It's about creating a
product which will please people and that they need, without using
unnecessary materials. The new Volkswagen is intelligent and cute. It's like
looking at a baby. A baby needn't be beautiful to make you smile.'
'My vote goes to the Caddie, a shopping trolley designed by Raul Barbieri
for Magis, the Italian manufacturer,' says Jasper Morrison, the British
product designer. 'It's a genuine reinterpretation of an essential product
which, until now, no one had thought of re-evaluating. It consists of a
lightweight aluminium frame on which is hung an expanding woven nylon sack.
It folds away to insignificance. It also offers an element of road safety -
a reflector built on to the side of the wheel. Beautifully engineered,
faultlessly practical.'
The TGV, or Train de Grande Vitesse, the high speed French train, is the
choice of Gert Dumbar, the Dutch graphic designer. 'It's innovative,
aesthetic, functional, comfortable, safe, silent and looks stunningly
beautiful crossing the European landscape,' he says. If the TGV was to adopt
a frequent flyer system like the airlines, I'd never again take a plane to a
TGV destination.'
Giorgio Armani, the Italian fashion dsigner, opts for the lamps of Giorgio
Sabattini, a young Italian designer making intricate lights in a
contemporary vein. 'I particularly like Giorgio Sabattini's work because it
is both exotic and modern,' says Armani. 'His lamps can look both like
objects from outer space or old Moroccan lights.'
'I admire Renault for having the guts to bring out a bold piece of design in
the Twingo,' says Sir Terence Conran, chairman of the Design Museum in
London. 'It's easy to drive and it's affordable. The Twingo is also an
exciting, modern design that has captured the imagination of the mass
market. The Renault Twingo is like other classic designs such as the
Concorde, which seemed absolutely extraordinary when it was first launched,
but is still remarkable years later.'
Jil Sander, the German fashion designer, selects an established design
classic: the Serie 7 chair designed in 1969 by Arne Jacobsen, the Danish
architect. 'Jacobsen's work succeeds in creating a context not only between
space and facade, but between space and design,' she says. 'A good example
is the Serie 7 chair which has lost none of its modernity or clarity of
style over the years.'
The Italian designer and architect, Ettore Sottsass, also picks a classic:
the Leica M6, a range finder camera introduced in 1984 by the eastern German
camera-maker as a direct descendant of its first-ever, the Leica 1 which was
brought out in 1914. Sottsass, a compulsive photographer, likes the camera
because it is 'small, well balanced and very well-made, although it's
expensive.' He also likes the Leica M6's reflex shutter. 'I have other
cameras that are easier to use, like my Olympus. But the reflex shutter
makes such a difference. It's almost a sexual pleasure every time I push the
button.'
James Dyson, the British inventor and engineer, chooses the new Spear &amp;
Jackson anvil large garden shears. 'When I first saw these shears I assumed
they'd be very expensive products from Sweden or Switzerland,' he says. 'It
was terrific to realise that they'd been made by Spear &amp; Jackson in
Sheffield. For years the only large shears on the market have been enlarged
pairs of scissors that are foul to use, particularly when you're hacking
away at really tough things. These new shears have a clever mechanism on the
end which gives them an anvil action that is much more effective. They're a
joy to use and they do look rather stylish.'
'If I could choose any product it would have to be the Thonet bentwood
chair, because it is a perfect combination of technical and aesthetic
innovation,' says Michele de Lucchi, design director of Olivetti, the
Italian electronics group. 'But the most interesting contemporary phenomena
are not products but events.' He cites Oz, the Dutch collective of ecology
activists who stage events to raise awareness of environmental issues among
other designers.

When the officials of Danish Post started to trawl around for a graphic
designer to devise a new corporate identity to pave the way towards
privatisation, one of their first stops was at Studio Dumbar in The Hague.
The Danes had admired the bold and, in some of its wilder manifestations,
avant garde corporate identity that the PTT - the Dutch post office and
telecommunications authority - had adopted in 1989. So much so, indeed, that
they asked their Dutch colleagues at the PTT to advise on the creation of
Danish Post's own new identity. The Dutch urged the Danes to seek the help
of Studio Dumbar, the Dutch designers behind their own instant design
classic.
The Danes hedged their bet. To ensure that Studio Dumbar's unpredictable
ideas were translated into something that would make sense to the Danish
public, the designers were teamed with Kontrapunkt, a Copenhagen-based
consultancy which has worked with Danish Post for 15 years. 'Kontrapunkt is
very good on solid, classic design,' says Gert Dumbar, the charismatic front
man of Studio Dumbar. 'We're the opposite  - coming up with new ideas and
shocking the client.'
An important part of the clever new Danish Post identity is the way it has
been designed to cope with a number of possible futures. 'We don't know
today whether the Post will continue as a state company or as a privatised
company,' says Aksal Lessmann, head of communications. (This will not be
decided until after the next Danish election this autumn.) 'But we do know
that we have to compete. We have to modernise and show the public that we
are not so old-fashioned.' Post offices will sell a much wider range of
services and the company will compete more aggressively abroad.
The new identity was launched in March at six post offices - three of these
in Copenhagen. Two more sites have been added since.
The design preserves important elements of the original 1939 identity and
its 1982 revision, the coach horn and the royal crown; but their colour has
been changed from red to yellow and they have been set more forcefully in a
red, round-ended box.
The 'S' in Post is given a memorable - but also traditional - twist of the
tail. Two new colours, green and blue, have been added to 'signal the new
business activities which are coming,' says Kim Meyer Anderson, the
Kontrapunkt team leader.
For the first time, the Danish Post has an identity which banishes confusion
with its private post competitors. The inherent flexibility of the logo -
the basis for a full corporate identity now in development - allows for
later subdivision of the company along the lines of the Dutch PTT.
And in a country where the bright red postboxes are regarded by the public
as 'almost holy,' the identity of Denmark itself is subtly strengthened.

FT  13 JUN 94 / Survey of Design in Europe (4): Leap to an interactive
future - John Thackara analyses the technological challenge for design
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THACKARA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The development of interactive information and communications systems is the
greatest challenge and opportunity for design since industrialisation.
The opportunity for design lies in developing products, or 'content', to
match the scale of the investments being made in the infrastructure: as much
money will be spent on networks between now and 2000 as was spent on all
telephone systems and equipment since Alexander Graham Bell invented them.
Penetrating this gigantic new market, however, will require a cultural shift
within the design business; much of the industry still suffers from a
tendency to operate in relative isolation from its clients, and believes
that a 'design' is a finished product or environment or piece of print - not
something intangible such as an interactivity programme.
Some designers are adapting faster than others to a new business environment
transformed by new technology and process re-engineering. Architects seem to
have accepted that the market for lofty, disengaged aesthetes has been
superseded in a world of smart buildings regarded by their owners not as
large objects but as information systems. Architects have espied a niche for
an expert in the building team who represents the building's final user -
who has the added ability to orchestrate coherence and quality in the
finished building.
Industrial designers in manufacturing face even more dramatic changes as the
distance between the producers of products, and their users, shrinks.
Sophisticated distribution and logistics systems, computer integrated
manufacturing and design technologies, new materials, and direct marketing,
have changed fundamentally what it means to 'design' a product.
The heroic industrial designer of legend, epitomised by Raymond Loewy, was
trained with a basically linear model of manufacturing in mind: he (rarely
she) inputted a 'concept', and various engineers and marketing types
produced and sold the product.
Today, multi-disciplinary, process re-engineered teams juggle multiple
inputs from consumers, widely distributed production facilities, and
intelligent distribution and retailing systems. Competitiveness is based on
the effectiveness of the innovation process as a whole. The product designer
 -like the architect - can no longer deliver competitive products from the
splendid isolation of the atelier.
The idea of collaborative innovation, and shared creativity, with users,
designers and producers creating new products together, is the most exciting
feature of what pundits are calling the New Economy - and potentially the
most profitable.
At the moment, less than 5 per cent of the Dollars 60bn a year spent by its
580,000 researchers on R&amp;D in Europe makes it to the market in the form of a
product or service which someone can buy. (And less than 1 per cent of that
Dollars 60bn is spent learning how to spend it.)
But economists have discovered that commercial performance is determined
more by the quality of interaction between research scientist users - and
this does not mean passive customers stuck behind one-way mirrors to 'try
things out'.
Such one-sided relationships between a company and its clients - the user
reacts, he or she does not propose - are being superseded by 'envisioning
laboratories' - environments in which users can play with new technologies
before an application has been packaged as a finished product. Companies
such as Xerox are designing research centres with multi-media capabilities
in which customers, supported by advanced programming tools, can quickly
model the consequence of re-configuring products and systems.
Mr John Seeley Brown, Xerox's research chief, explains: 'It is not enough
just to tell people about some new insights from the lab. You have to get
them to experience it in a way which evokes its power and possibility. Put
another way, we are trying to prototype a use before we prototype a system.'
Pre-prototyping user needs has obvious benefits even in traditional 'hard'
product development, where design decisions tend to be irrevocable once
tooling and production investments are specified. When the whole
technological environment is novel - as it is with interactive computers and
communications - the ability to involve users in the design and simulation
of new applications is even more valuable.
Nicholas Negroponte, director of the Media Lab at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology (MIT) points out: 'At the beginning of the century,
people who invented new media were the users: photography was invented by
photographers, cinema by film makers. This intimate coupling of the inventor
and the creative user only disappeared with the invention of television and,
later, computers. Its disappearance was needless.'
Today, even the most gung-ho of the American telephone companies and media
giants agree that unless more content, or 'programming', is developed for
their much-hyped infobahnen - highways of the mind - they will not go very
far as a business. All that is on offer so far is video-on-demand and
tele-shopping - decidedly banal electronic versions of existing human
activities; hardly the stuff of which new civilisations are made.
So where are ideas for new needs to come from? However well envisioning labs
engage with groups of users, someone has to provide an aesthetic stimulus -
throw ideas into the ring - to provoke genuinely fresh thinking. This is
where design can provide a cultural function as a bridge between industry
and artists who are interested in technology but suspicious of big business.
Intellectuals and artists have been preoccupied by the implication of
information technology for some time. For avant garde media artists in
particular, the notion of the interface has replaced the finished artwork as
the main object of enquiry, but few computer scientists (or even marketers)
have the faintest idea how exciting (and even marketable) some of these
ideas can be.
Design can be a useful mediator in breaking down the isolation from each
other of artists, computer scientists and users, and in promoting the
fruitful interaction between them which may just yield the new concepts and
applications needed to fulfil the promise of the new technologies.
The need for such bridge-building between industry and artists is not new.
It was the main mission of the Bauhaus 70 years ago. The original Bauhaus
foundered on the rock of elitism and exclusivity: the news media - inclusive
of users as well as designers - may mean that a design-based Electronic
Bauhaus becomes Europe's secret weapon.

FT  13 JUN 94 / Survey of Design in Europe (3): Identities have to endure -
Graphic designers work across national borders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICK POYNOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For graphic designers who believe they have a vital message for business,
the early 1990s is a period of both modest progress and - at times -
frustrating retrenchment.
On the one hand, clients left reeling by designers making a hit-and-run dash
for the fast buck in the 1980s are now understandably shy of sweeping
invitations to throw out perfectly servicable identities and start all over
again.
On the other hand, the future of almost any ambitious European business will
lie as much outside its national borders as within them, and there is an all
the more pressing need for design as a way of differentiating yourself.
'I don't think there's less work,' says Chris Ludlow, a partner in Henrion,
Ludlow &amp; Schmidt, corporate identity specialists in London. 'But there is
more nervousness about making visual changes. People want to maintain or
adapt or service their existing identities, but also to see them in the
context of the total organisation. You can't always demand a clean sheet of
paper'.
Designers, like their clients, must increasingly think European if they are
to thrive. A German partner helps to give Henrion, Ludlow &amp; Schmidt a close
understanding of the German mentality and market place. Clients include
Beiersdorf (cosmetics and pharmaceuticals,) Krups and Volkswagen. Lloyd
Northover Citigate, a 35-strong consultancy, numbers Banco Santander,
Madrid, Intrum Justitia and Amsterdam among its clients.
But what makes a German manufacturer turn to a British consultancy? The
answer lies in what Ludlow guardedly calls the 'myth, or fact, of British
creativity.' The humour element,' he adds, ' is very much appreciated.' At
the same time, the very fact that design is so well integrated into German
companies (there are fewer external consultancies; designers work in-house)
means they often feel a need to go outside in search of a strategic
overview. 'A lot of the work they do on the continent is much more more
formal - systems - less emotional and imaginative,' says John Lloyd of Lloyd
Northover Citigate. 'Our style in the UK is closer to the US style.'
That may be so, but the designer working across national borders faces some
obvious pitfalls. Is it possible to reconcile and satisfy the tastes of so
many different markets without reducing the individuality of a country's
graphics to an inoffensive but bland and flavourless Eurostyle, which ends
up making everywhere look the same? As Lloyd himself concedes: 'There is a
danger that you try to please everybody and end up pleasing no one.'
Lloyd Northover Citigate's railway identity and livery for European Night
Services recently received approval from the Dutch, Belgium, French, German
and British partners in the cross-Channel project. 'It really is a
pan-European brand,' says Lloyd. 'It's more to do with the benefits of the
service than any of the destinations.'
The other important changes in European graphics are being driven by
technology. In design studios Apple Mackintosh's domination is now complete.
Neville Brody, the 'bad boy' of 1980s design who became an international
star, believes that the computer will force change at all levels of the
design business. 'The annual report still needs laying out,' he says, 'but
more and more companies have gone in-house with their design because they
can - it makes financial sense, it makes manpower sense. The outside
designer's role is to come up with a structure, a language, and probably a
series of digital templates. The age of the corporate design manual is
completely finished.'
Not quite finished, perhaps, but certainly evolving fast. CD-Rom-based
identity management systems are already replacing cumbersome paper manuals.
Electronic multimedia annual reports will soon be commonplace. The big
studios may be slower to retool for change, but they can see it coming.
Lloyd Northover Citigate has recently established a 'new media group' to
explore these issues.
But there is a larger problem. Whatever the merits of the identity
specialists' strategic thinking, the design outcome is often disappointing.
Since the 1980s, the gap between the larger, business-conscious
consultancies and smaller creative teams has widened.
Ironically, the reason Neville Brody has been visible in the 1990s is
because, like his larger rivals, he has been working on the continent - in
France, Germany and Spain. His most elaborate commission, an ingenious
indentity for Osterreichischer Rundfunk, the Austrian state broadcasting
company (ORF), based on structure and graphic relationships rather than a
simple inflexible logo, suggests that a reassessment is in order - not only
of Brody himself, but of the way corporations commission their graphics.

FT  13 JUN 94 / Survey of Design in Europe (2): Skin-deep styling is not
enough / Assessing industrial design's commercial clout over the past 15
years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
From Olivetti to Fiat, Braun to Citroen, the commercial power of industrial
design in Europe's mass markets - not merely the elite niches occupied by
the likes of BMW and Bang &amp; Olufsen - has been evident for decades to any
manager who cared to look.
During the past 15 years, under a variety of influences (notably the
exemplary effect of Sony and other Japanese imports), the proportion of
companies which exploit industrial design to its full creative potential,
rather than simply treating it as skin-deep styling, has started to soar.
Converts since the late 1970s include Philips, Volkswagen and Ford of Europe
 -whose commitment paved the way for its US parent company's conversion.
The remarkable success of the Ford Taurus, launched in 1985 and last year
still the best-selling car in the US, has not only changed the face, but
also the character, of American cars. And, more than any other single
exemplar, it has fired a new commitment to design among a wide range of
other US companies: for example, its arch-rival General Motors, Apple, Black
&amp; Decker, and Rubbermaid. (The last four companies all won gold awards in
this year's US Industrial Design Excellence Awards, announced last month.)
The new-found pre-eminence of design in these companies' priorities is not
merely a matter of copying the actions of successful rivals. It is also the
result of careful strategic analysis.
This shows that, with technology, quality, low-cost manufacturing and
high-class service all becoming competitive commodities as industries
mature, a product's shape, feel and character - together with, wherever
possible, some unique functional features - are some of the few ways in
which a company can now differentiate itself from the competition.
Yet behind the new organisational awakening of design lies a set of
paradoxes. If its commercial power has been manifest since at least the
1930s, why do so many managements still fail to recognise it?
Why, when they do, have so many failed to give it sufficient weight within
their organisation?
Why, in spite of repeated design-led successes in the marketplace, have many
of the design pioneers allowed their commitment to design to decay?
The problem is not merely the generic tendency of any established
organisational philosophy or practice to erode over time - much as marketing
has shrunk in many consumer goods companies from an imaginative,
broad-lensed way of thinking to a narrow set of processes and procedures.
Design's problem is much greater for several reasons:
It tends to be overlooked in the strategic concepts which most managers use.
Academics and consultants have failed to develop a powerful typology of the
various constituents of design - the equivalent of marketing's 'four P's'.
Design's historically junior position within the corporate hierarchy, buried
deep beneath marketing or engineering, makes it hard for management to give
it sufficient weight alongside other functions. This is true even in the
rapidly growing number of companies where product development has been
reorganised from a traditionally sequential set of department-by-department
activities, into a parallel process in which specialists of all kinds work
together in integrated teams.
Even in companies where design is at last being taken seriously, it tends
still to be seen only as a 'soft', lightweight, right-brained activity by
managers whose education has been largely left-brained, verbal, linear and
analytical. Various 'harder' aspects of design need to be recognised.
In countries - unlike Italy and Japan - where right-brained, visual,
synthesising skills carry a lower social status than left-brained,
analytical ones, designers are seldom taken seriously by the organisations
for which they work. They tend to be seen as third class citizens, rated
even more lowly than the engineers.
Even when top management recognises the potential power of design and the
versatility of designers, and tries to unleash their hidden potential, the
way is often barred by turf warfare with engineers and/or marketing
specialists.
Even among the corporate design pioneers, these inhibiting factors tend to
assert themselves as the years pass, especially when the original top
management gives way to a new generation. This is true of Olivetti, Braun
and IBM.
For all these reasons, most companies need to undertake a voyage of
'executive discovery' - or rediscovery - about design's potential role in
strategy.
Under Mr Don Petersen, its former chairman, Ford undertook that voyage
successfully, at least in the US. In Europe its commitment faltered a decade
ago after launching its avant-garde Sierra, partly because of the car's
early commercial problems but also because the company's long-standing power
barons (its departmental heads) fought against the introduction of an
effective cross-departmental system of 'programme management.'
Only when this was finally given its head, in the European-US Mondeo
development project, could the European designers again pull their full
weight as equal members of the product development team, along with
engineering, production, marketing and so forth.
Ford's start-stop-start use of industrial design in Europe holds any number
of lessons for companies which have yet to embark on their own voyage of
executive discovery about the commercial power of design - or need to take a
revision course.
The themes in this article will be explored in greater depth in Developing
Strategic Thinking, a book edited by R. Garratt which will be published by
McGraw Hill in the autumn.

FT  13 JUN 94 / Survey of Design in Europe (1): Talent needs intelligence
too - In the competitive international markets of the 1990s, design is more
important than ever. European companies must use it more imaginatively if
they are to prosper
</HEADLINE>

Locked in a secret room in the labyrinthine headquarters of Thomson Consumer
Electronics in Paris are a dozen or so television sets which, or so the
company hopes, will bring it back into the black after years of losses and
spark a revolution in the recession-scarred European electronics industry.
The televisions, which will remain shrouded in secrecy until their launch
this September, are the legacy of Thomson's liaison with Philippe Starck,
the superstar French designer who became its artistic director last year.
Most 'new' electronic products look like updated versions of their
predecessors - or competitors, but these designs ooze lateral thinking. They
seem so fresh and so different from anything else on the market that it
looks as though Starck must have started from scratch by dreaming up the
type of television the company's customers would like to own.
Thomson knows that the iconoclastic designs are a gamble. Yet it is
convinced that European consumers are so bored by what Starck calls the grey
boxes now on the market that they are ready for something new. 'For years
companies have been trying to sell new products with a new techno-this, or
new techno-that,' says Starck. 'People take technology for granted these
days. What they want are warm, friendly products - something to seduce
them.'
Thomson is not the only European company to have come to the conclusion
that, after a frustrating decade of losing market share to the Japanese and
Americans, it could regain a competitive advantage by adopting a more
imaginative approach to design.
Olivetti, the Italian information technology group, is revising its design
strategy as part of its corporate overhaul. Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz,
the German car companies, are taking a fresh look at their new models for
the mid-1990s following Renault's success with the Twingo, its funkily
futuristic new city car.
The concept of design as a competitive tool has been conventional wisdom
since the early 1900s, when Peter Behrens, a German architect, transformed
the fortunes of AEG's industrial empire with a crack team of designers
including Walter Gropius and Ludwig Mies Van Der Rohe, the founding fathers
of the Bauhaus. Iconoclastic design has since been central to other European
successes - from Flaminio Bertoni's 1955 Citroen DS19, to Ettore Sottsass's
1969 Olivetti Valentino typewriter.
Europe still has an abundance of design talent. Gert Dumbar, Fabien Baron
and Neville Brody are among the world's most influential graphic designers,
as are Philippe Starck, Jasper Morrison and Marc Newson in furniture; and
John Galliano, Vivienne Westwood and Martin Margiela in fashion. Some
companies have exploited their skills, such as Vitra of Switzerland, which
has become a world leader in office furniture (and last week won one of this
year's EC Design Prizes), thanks partly to its liaison with designers such
as Starck and Morrison.
Yet successes are still outnumbered by failures. There is still a dearth of
European companies which have made the most of design on a large scale. The
excuses are legion: everything from failure of nerve and the lowly status of
designers in the corporate hierarchy to disillusion with the superficial use
of design as a styling tool in the 1980s. Is it realistic to expect European
companies to adopt a more intelligent approach in the future?
The blunt answer is that they do not have a choice. It cannot be a
coincidence that some of the new converts to design, notably Thomson
Consumer Electronics and Renault, are in dire financial straits.
Volkswagen's decision to unveil Concept 1, the acclaimed new Beetle
prototype, at this year's Detroit Motor Show was interpreted as an attempt
to distract attention from its industrial espionage row with GM and
atrocious US sales figures.
There are also positive reasons why European industry might re-assess its
approach to design. One is the significant shift in consumer attitudes. The
increase in prosperity from the 1950s onwards encouraged consumers to
purchase a range of new gadgets such as refrigerators, freezers, colour
televisions and video recorders. Today's consumers are less impressionable,
more discerning, aware that unnecessary expenditure is bad for their
ecological consciences, as well as their bank balances.
This means that manufacturers must work harder to attract consumers by
adopting more imaginative strategies. Design can play an important part in
that process, providing it is properly integrated with other areas such as
production planning and communications.
'Public perceptions are shifting from quantity to quality,' says Stefano
Marzano, design director of Philips, the Dutch electronics group. 'New
technology dominated product development in the 1980s, but it's not an end
in itself. Why redesign a washing machine with 15 programmes so it has 20 or
25, when you know the consumer only uses six?'
At the same time, consumers do seem to be responsive to genuinely innovative
products, which are visually stimulating as well as efficient. Renault
almost lost its nerve when the Twingo's pre-launch research showed that 40
per cent of the market 'actively disliked it'. The launch went ahead after
Patrick Le Quement, design director, argued that '10 per cent would fall in
love with it'. The Twingo is now France's second best-selling car.
Consumer pressure for innovation comes at a time when many industries are
accelerating product development plans in anticipation of enforced
structural changes in their markets. The car industry is accelerating the
development of micro-compact and electric cars to accommodate tighter
environmental controls. The new multimedia industry will create new areas of
design such as interfaces for home shopping and information systems. It
should also fuel demand for new products in sectors such as office
electronics and even furniture for those who want to work from home via
modems.
Olivetti, which has used design successfully during past periods of
transition, hopes to do so again as its old information technology
activities are subsumed into the multi-media industry. 'We know there'll be
deep changes in the structure of our industry, but we don't know exactly
what they'll be,' says Michele de Lucchi, design director. 'What we can do
is use design as a tool to guide us - and our customers.'
In practical terms this means that Olivetti is developing new products,
notably multi-function machines such as combined fax and photocopiers. De
Lucchi is also refining its styling by using bright colours and tactile
materials so the sophisticated new machines appear accessible and easy to
use.
This new era of product development coincides with structural changes within
industry which are eradicating one of the old deficiencies of European
design management: the failure to integrate design with other activities.
Manufacturing systems are now so complex that it is increasingly difficult
to separate different functions and to relegate design to the role of a
superficial styling tool. The Twingo's development was facilitated by
Renault's adoption of a Japanese team-based product development system.
Such changes create new opportunities, but they also pose huge challenges.
European companies are under pressure to invest more intellectual energy in
design - and to take adventurous decisions - at a time when confidence is
still depressed by recession.
But the time is ripe for change. The defeats of the early 1990s must surely
have shattered any lingering illusions about the play-it-safe policy of
producing yet more over-programmed washing machines. The Twingo's triumph
suggests there is an appetite for inventive European design. Thomson
Consumer Electronics hopes to prove that when it unlocks the secret room
containing Philippe Starck's television sets.

FT  13 JUN 94 / Media Futures: Haldeman - a new insight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The diaries of the late H R Haldeman, written every night while he served as
President Richard Nixon's chief of staff and closest confidante, have been
published in the US in two formats - as a conventional book (G P Putnam, New
York, Dollars 27.50) and on CD-ROM (Sony Electronic Publishing Co, Santa
Monica, California, Dollars 69.95) as the Complete Multimedia Edition. In
his introduction, Stephen E Ambrose, author of the well-received three
volume life of Nixon, states he would welcome the opportunity to write an
entire book based on what is revealed in the diaries.
The printed version has instantly soared to near the top of the US
best-seller lists. Newspaper articles, analyses by columnists and lengthy
letters to the editor from Henry Kissinger have generated controversy. Was
Nixon anti-black and anti-semitic? Haldeman recounts Nixon's complaint to
the Rev Billy Graham about 'the total Jewish domination of the media', a
view previously confined to the lunatic fringe. Did Nixon and Kissinger
consider postponing an end to US participation in the Vietnam War in order
to increase Nixon's prospects for re-election? The diaries strongly suggest
an affirmative answer.
Can there be many better arguments against limiting a president to two terms
than Nixon, who violated constitutional norms in so many ways during his
first term, telling his subordinates that in planning for his second term
they should recognise that 'we will have awesome power with no discipline,
that there won't be another election coming up to discipline us?'
The Haldeman diaries are indispensable to any serious work on the Nixon
presidency or on Henry Kissinger. But the epoch marking fact is that real
research will require review of the CD-ROM.
As the book indicates in a preface, presumably to be read after purchase, it
is a condensed version of the diaries. The full text, which is available
only on disc, contains at least two and half times the words in the book.
The book has an inadequate name index, with, for example, well over 100
references to Kissinger without any indication of the subject discussed. It
is impossible to use the index for a subject such as wiretaps or Vietnam.
The disc, however, permits the reader to enter any word, or combination of
words, and move to the relevant passage with the selected keywords
highlighted on the screen.
Another useful feature of the disc is the ability to obtain instant
identification of any individuals mentioned in the text. If, for example, a
reference to a 'dragon lady' is obscure, a click of the mouse will produce a
short biographical sketch of Anna Chenault. The user of the disc can split
the monitor screen, with the diary entry on one side and the presidential
log book and newspaper headlines on the other.
Some of the remaining space on the disc is occupied by 700 still
photographs, 45 minutes of amateur movies taken by Haldeman, and a 120-page
unsent letter from Haldeman, then in prison, to James Neal, the prosecutor,
asserting Haldeman's innocence and giving his version of Watergate.
Research may never be the same again.

Patronage is the key to good architecture. When a top British company has
the courage and skill to commission a leading architect to design one of its
major buildings the result can be inspiring, both for British business and
the architectural profession. The new residential training college for Cable
and Wireless at Coventry shines like a beacon of encouragement in a world
where good architecture is badly held back by both the recession and client
timidity.
Quite simply it is one of the best and most thoughtful new buildings to have
been built in England for some time.
When it came to its search for an architect for a new college on a rural
site near Coventry, Cable and Wireless was wise enough to follow the route
of a private competition by interviewing a shortlist of potential
candidates.
The company's choice of Richard MacCormac's firm of MacCormac, Jamieson and
Prichard was made for two reasons. First, it appreciated the experience of
the firm in the building of academic and residential buildings. Second,
Cable and Wireless recognised the firm's distinction: Richard MacCormac had
made it to the top of the architectural tree as president of the RIBA.
Before choosing, the selectors took a tour of MacCormac's existing
buildings, such as the waterside, residential Sainsbury Building at
Worcester College, Oxford, the New Court at Fitzwilliam College and the more
recent chapel at the same college in Cambridge. These showed the clear
aesthetic and practical development of the practice over the last decade.
MacCormac's most recent building in Oxford is the Garden Quadrangle for St.
John's College; and his competition winning scheme for Balliol is awaited
with interest.
Cable and Wireless is relatively unusual for a British company (although one
that is global in its activities), in wanting to build a residential
training centre from scratch on a virgin site. Many British companies find
it almost irresistible to acquire a old country house, preferably in a
stately park.
The site outside Coventry is close to the University of Warwick and shortly
to be bordered by a new business park. It is perfectly placed and designed
with assurance and imagination. MacCormac has rare gifts. He is fascinating
to talk to and refreshingly flexible in his approach to architectural
debate. His quiet thoughtfulness shows at every point in the Cable and
Wireless College.
The company wanted somewhere that immediately gave a sense of a special
place of learning; a place where residential life is made dignified and
enjoyable by the surroundings. You sense its special qualities the moment
you arrive, driving past the water and scrunching on the gravel as you reach
the gently modulated steps beneath the wave-like curves of the roofs.
A parallel series of single-storey teaching studios stretch out on each side
of the main entrance. As you pass through you reach the central space of the
college - an oval court that is partly sheltered and partly open to the sky.
This is the heart of the college: in a traditional way the refectory,
library and common rooms gather here. The college garden separates you from
the residential buildings. At one end of the long garden court is the
leisure and fitness centre.
Water plays an important part in the overall layout - a long rill running
through the garden culminating in a waterfall beneath the leisure centre.
The firm of Colvin and Moggridge were the landscape architects and they seem
to have understood the sense of almost oriental simplicity of the
architecture. The gardens, water, trees and varied surfaces underfoot all
unify the whole site and create a rare feeling of another world.
The atmosphere of calm is as much to do with the choice of materials as it
is with the sense of enclosure. The specially made green ceramic tiles on
the wave-like roofs have an extraordinary capacity to reflect the changing
light in the sky. The stone and concrete is everywhere finely finished; the
palette of colour inside and outside is natural and elegant.
There is no sense of pretension or contrivance about this building. It is a
place which is respected and liked by those who work there. Prof David
Ashton, the college's chief executive, explained how well the traditional
collegiate qualities of the design help to cement working relationships on
his courses on advanced communications technology.
The architect and the client had to marry the everyday world of human
relationships, laboratory and classroom teaching with a mass of high-tech
equipment and its necessary services. This is where the students learn. They
do so in a new building that, by its beauty and careful planning,
demonstrates that good architecture can inspire and humanise the most arcane
technology.
