FT  13 JUN 94 / Media Futures: Japan plays catch-up with US - At first sight
advanced information networks might seem like another instance of Japan
stealing a march on its competitors in a key new technology. The truth is
rather different

<TEXT>
The dull, grey halls of Japan's Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications
seem an unlikely cradle for inspired visions of the country's high-tech
future.
But for several months these shadowy corridors have been abuzz with
activity, as bureaucrats have raced against time to come up with a credible
blueprint for Japan's information superhighway.
The speed and enthusiasm with which the MPT has moved has been startling.
Last month, in a report by the Telecommunications Council, it made public
its vision of Japan's advanced information network. The report will form the
basis for the ministry's policy-making.
It said Japan should be well on the way to an advanced information society
by the turn of the century, with 20 per cent of the population connected by
fibre-optic cable that will allow speedy, two-way transmission of vast
amounts of information. By 2010, such cables should criss-cross the nation
in a network that would provide the entire population with access to the
information superhighway.
At first sight it might seem like another instance of Japan stealing a march
on its competitors with an ambitious long-term plan to give it a lead in a
key new technology. The truth is rather different. Japan is behind the US in
plans for an information superhighway and there is little detail on how the
ministry's report might become reality.
By the MPT's own estimate, the programme would cost between Y33tn and Y55tn,
with an additional Y42tn needed if the cable is to be installed underground.
As yet there is no indication where funds on that scale would come from.
Yet the bureaucrats are in a hurry for a number of reasons. They are under
pressure to catch up with the US which, when it comes to multimedia, is
several years ahead of Japan. The MPT estimates that by the year 2010, the
information and communication industries could be generating between 5 and 6
per cent of gross domestic product, or Y123tn. The number of new jobs
created could come to 2.4m, or more than the number employed in the Japanese
automobile industry today.
Japan is searching for a new engine for economic growth. The post-war growth
of the Japanese economy was fuelled first by heavy industry and then in turn
by automobiles and consumer electronics. With international competition in
both industries mounting, and after a long and bruising recession, economic
strategists are searching for competitive advantage in higher value added
fields. Multimedia is an obvious candidate.
The telecommunications ministry is not alone in mapping out a multimedia
future for Japan. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry last
month published its own report on an advanced information programme. As the
past architect of Japan's industrial future, Miti is increasingly convinced
that added value in economic activity will come not from manufacturing but
from intellectual activity, such as software. A sophisticated information
infrastructure is crucial in fostering such intellectual activity.
According to the MPT's vision, Japan's advanced information infrastructure
should be rolled out in three stages over a period of 17 years.
The first stage would be to connect the largest cities, prefectural
government offices and public facilities, such as hospitals, libraries and
schools, with fibre-optic cable. This would link 20 per cent of the
population.
The target for the second stage, would be to link cities with a population
of over 100,000 and give coverage to 60 per cent of the population. The
final stage would aim for nationwide linkage by 2010.
Plans for financing all this, however, are vague. The job of building the
superhighway should be left to the private sector, the government argues,
and the MPT believes government's role should be to provide interest-free or
low-interest loans and tax incentives. There could also be spending to
promote the use of information superhighway services, especially among
public institutions. This could start as early as next spring.
The authorities' approach to regulation could be equally important. Tight
regulations and lack of competition have kept the prices of many services
very high in Japan. Without greater competition in providing multimedia
services, prices could be so high as to discourage many consumers. There are
some signs that Japanese ministries recognise that the multimedia market
will only take off with a plurality of service providers offering a wide
range of services.
The only private company capable of building a fibre-optic cable network of
any scale is NTT, the telecommunications group. It has drawn up plans for
laying fibre-optic cable throughout the country by 2015.
Yet by relaxing many of the rules that separate the broadcasting and
telecommunications industries - which have hindered the growth of cable TV
operators - the MPT is attempting to foster competition against NTT. Rules
on foreign ownership of broadcasting companies have been relaxed and the
ministry is considering a plan to enable the country's small, independent
cable TV operators to link up using the infrastructure of the relatively new
telecommunications companies known as new common carriers. While the
authorities labour over the regulatory issues, a swarm of private projects
are under way to test the practicalities of advanced two-way communications
and the services they might offer.
The National Children's Hospital and Tokyo Teishin Hospital are carrying out
an experiment linking some of their patients to the hospital through digital
networks. A colour videophone is place in the patient's house to enable
doctors to conduct simple examinations of their patients. Data on blood
pressure, urine samples and from cardiograms can also be sent through the
digital phone lines.
Secom, a security systems company, and a hospital in Tokyo have started a
service to provide support in analysing computed tomography and MRI images.
Hospitals and clinics which sign up for the service send in CT and MRI
images through integrated services digital networks for analysis by
specialist doctors. The analysis is then sent back by fax. But in future
Secom aims to conduct the services on interactive networks.
Sega, the video games maker, has started providing cable TV subscribers with
games-on-demand. And trading houses, such as Sumitomo and C Itoh, have tied
up with US companies to develop home shopping.
Okazaki, a city in central Japan, has been designated by the MPT as a model
city for multimedia networks. Students will be able to access educational
information collected by the city using existing cable TV networks, and
teleconferencing will be used for major school events, such as student board
meetings.
As projects multiply, the practical benefits of advanced communications
networks will become clearer to a still mystified public.

Remote medical services:
The National Children's Hospital and the Teishin Hospital in Tokyo have
linked up with some of their patients in an experiment to provide remote
medical services.
Secom and the Kugayama Hospital in Tokyo are providing a service to
hospitals and clinics which enables them to send medical images, such as
those obtained in computer tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, over
advanced telecommunications lines to a central station, which then
retransmits specialist analyses.
Nikon, Fujitsu, Kyoto University and Osaka University are conducting
experiments in telemedicine, such as the transfer of X-ray photographs and
other medical data from one hospital to another across telephone
lines.
Cable TV experiments:
Sega has started providing video games on demand for subscribers to two
cable TV networks in Japan.
In the spring of 1995, NTT plans to test the combined utilisation of cable
for CATV video transmission, video-on-demand, telephone and other services
through optical subscriber systems.
General experiments:
NTT is developing applications for multimedia in the office, using
high-speed, broad-band backbone networks operating at the gigabit level,
using a combination of a synchronous transfer mode and optical fibre
technologies.
Next spring NTT will be conducting experiments in high-performance
electronic mail, electronic newspapers and other database services for
private use.
Public experiments:
The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications is promoting a programme in the
Kansai Science City with the private sector to conduct multimedia
experiments ranging from video-on-demand and TV shopping to personal
handyphones, home reservation systems and video conferencing.
Okazaki, a city in central Japan, is being designated a multimedia model
city by the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications. Educational photos and
video are being digitised and the database will be linked by optical fibre
to schools in the area, so that students can call up the data whenever they
need it. An interactive conferencing system is also being considered for
schools.
The Ministry of Education is setting up a multimedia promotion group to lay
the groundwork for the use of multimedia in education.
Tokyo metropolitan government will conduct multimedia experiments in TV
shopping, remote education services and video on demand.

FT  13 JUN 94 / Working Life: Binoculars: one man's view - Style
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES JENNINGS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is hard to get by at Epsom, Ascot or a Test match without them. But
binoculars are a bit like fire extinguishers - you only use them rarely and
then in something of a hurry. And like fire extinguishers if they don't work
immediately you won't get a second chance to deal with the matter in hand -
whether it's picking out your horse, glimpsing a migratory Redwing, or
identifying a yacht off Cowes.
So binoculars must be sensible and easy to use. This automatically rules out
some of the smaller pocket binoculars, made by Nikkon or Pentax and
available in many high street shops; however cute and stylish they look
they're too fiddly to adjust and too uncomfortable to hold for any length of
time.
This also goes for the Zeiss ladies binoculars, which look terrific but are
awkward to use and cost over Pounds 300 (Zeiss' larger offerings are handier
but come in at over Pounds 700). At the opposite end of the scale there is
the Russian-made Helios range at less then Pounds 50 for an honest pair of
binoculars. These are cheap but they're not the best optically and they're
distinctly old-fashioned in use.
The serious binocular user will probably go for something like a Viking or a
Bresser - both of which despite their names are essentially Japanese. And
this is the important part - provided that the optical equipment inside your
binoculars is Japanese there's little difference in image quality between
most makers, only one of price and usability.
The Viking Firefly for instance, is a compact ladies binocular offering 10x
magnification, a 24mm lens, anti-glare coating and a moulded grip. It is
easy to use and highly effective. The larger Viking model, with 10x
magnification but a 42mm lens (for a bigger, brighter view) costs around
Pounds 200. It fits the palm nicely and can be adjusted for focus and eye
postion almost without thinking.
Bresser binoculars are of German design but Japanese manufacture. Its 7x50
Action model is tough and workmanlike at Pounds 128; while the heavy
traditional 12x50 Corvette design costs Pounds 244 and will give a fine
image, but at the expense of a little more shake. Indeed, a magnification of
anything over 12x is likely to be unhelpful, since the bigger the
magnification the more shake is transmitted. Officials at Cowes use vast
binoculars with 20x magnification but they have to rest them on tripods to
keep them still. Zoom binoculars offering variable magnification from 8x to
20x are fun, but (quite apart from shake) the extra lenses inside reduce
image quality and the size of the field of view.
Whatever you choose make sure you give it a reasonable trial first. Look for
any curvature of straight lines in the field of view; and watch for
imperfect colour correction - do whites come out yellow or bluish rather
than white? You'll need a decent photographic shop or optical equipment
specialist if you want to do it properly. Somewhere like Broadhurst,
Clarkson and Fuller in Farringdon Road, London, is a good bet.

FT  13 JUN 94 / Working Life: Euro - Buzzword
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European elections with their 'Euro-candidates', 'Euro-sceptics' and
'Euro-enthusiasts' are the latest confirmation 'Euro-' has become the most
highly charged of political terms. A decade ago it sent us to sleep. But its
meaning depends on who is using it.
In Australia it has a double life as the name for a kangaroo, according to
Webster's dictionary. In Europe, the prefix is as old as the continent.
'Euro' comes from 'Europa' (Greek: Europe), the Phoenician princess abducted
by the Greek god Zeus who appeared in the form of a white bull. The noun and
adjective 'European' have spawned the inevitable 'Europeanise' and
'Europeanisation'.
In 1949 George Orwell spun 'Eurasian' (combining Empire and India, meaning
an Anglo-Saxon who spent a lifetime in India) into the power block 'Eurasia'
for '1984'. Then in 1963, investment banks Hambros and Warburgs created
'Eurodollars' and 'Eurobonds'. Since then, with the UK's impending
membership of the European Community in the 1960s and the money market
expansion in the 1980s, 'Euro' has enjoyed two periods of popularity.
During the 1960s when the pejorative 'Eurocrat' and 'Eurospeak' nodded
towards Orwell's faceless state, the political foundations of the word, with
an anti-European leaning, were laid. There was an inundation of consumer
'Eurobabble' in the 1970s as UK membership began to affect shoppers and
suppliers, while economists warned of growing 'Eurosclerosis'.
In the 1980s, 'Euro' arrived as shortspeak for Eurodollar Futures in Chicago
and New York. And the mid-1980s saw 'Euros', meaning people from Europe,
used by Americans as in: 'there are Euros on holiday . . . and 'Miami Vice'
clones' (Newsday 1989); and by the British in 'why didn't we assert British
Rule and make the Euros change to furlongs and chains . . .?' (The Listener
1986). America today uses 'Eurotrash' for Europeans in New York, dark of
suit and thick of accent in Soho or the Village.
In the UK, the word pulls in two directions. In British politics, 'Euro-'
evokes its antithesis, not Asia- or America- but a feeling of Britishness.
Politicians starting life as Members of the European Parliament became
'Euro-MPs', a Brussels copy of Westminster. But in business, 'Euro-' is a
positive and unequivocal form: 'Euro-' spellsmultinational, culturally
adjusted. 'Dun &amp; Bradstreet's Key British Enterprises' has 171 of the
largest companies bearing the 'Euro-' prefix, like Eurobake, Eurohire,
Eurotec and Eurotunnel.
The greatest 'Euro-' remains the evergreen 'Eurovision Song Contest'. The
patron saint of television, St Clair of Assisi, could not have wished for
better 'Euroconvergence'.

FT  13 JUN 94 / Working Life: Tax-free benefits for those made redundant -
Finance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Few employees like to consider the possibility of redundancy. But if you are
faced with the prospect of being 'surplus to requirements', you should at
least be able to get benefits, such as redundancy counselling from your
employer, without being taxed for them.
Usually, benefits provided by an employer are subject to income tax. But
David Harris, barrister at Prince Henry's Chambers, London, says benefits
provided with the sole or main purpose of helping the employee adjust to the
end of his employment, and/or enabling him to find other gainful employment,
are tax-exempt.
'Gainful' employment can include self-employment and even positions which
carrying an honorarium, such as a job with a charity, although the position
must involve payment other than expenses.
As long as this condition is fulfilled, the employer can provide advice and
guidance. This can take the form of the services of an out-placement
counsellor, professional preparation of a curriculum vitae; training or
re-training; the use of office equipment or even the services of a
secretary.
The exemption also extends to travelling expenses met by the employer as
long as they are in connection with the tax-exempt benefits. So they can
include travelling from the employee's place of work to a counsellor, a
training centre or an interview and even visits to prospective clients, if
you are thinking of self-employment. It is highly unlikely though that
reimbursement for travel expenses from the employee's home will be
tax-exempt.
Harris says that although the employer cannot restrict the benefit to any
particular type of employee (such as directors), it can be limited to a
particular class so that an employer can require his staff to have had five
years' service before giving them this benefit.
Relief is not available for services performed outside the UK, so an
overseas employee who is made redundant cannot benefit from the exemption
unless he returns to seek 'gainful employment' in Britain. If he has been
working abroad for a long time, he may not be liable to pay UK tax, anyway.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
There are few things the French like better than techno-toys. Only a few
years ago they were extolling the virtues of Minitel, the interactive
information system that might be more of a bumpy B-road than an information
superhighway, but is now a fixture of Gallic life. However, the techno-toy
of the moment is the Bi-Bop, the portable phone launched last year by France
Telecom. So far the Bi-Bop is only available in Paris and Strasbourg. But
the cafe terraces and garden squares of those cities are already peppered
with phoneaholic Bi-Bop owners chattering into their natty black plastic
phones.
The Bi-Bop has its drawbacks. It is not, after all, truly portable. It can
only be used within reach of a borne, one of the transmission boxes that
France Telecom has fitted to the Paris and Strasbourg lamp-posts. That said,
so many bornes have been installed that there are few places in Paris or
Strasbourg where you cannot use a Bi-Bop, and it can receive calls from -
and make them to - anywhere in the world.
Also, the Bi-Bop does have its advantages. One is its price. It only costs
FFr990.00 (around Pounds 100) to buy the phone itself - plus FFr54.50 for
monthly rental and FFr29.00 a month for access to an ansamachine - which
makes it much, much cheaper than a conventional portable phone.
The Bi-Bop also has the benefit of good design. It is small enough to be
popped into a pocket: but not so small that the user risks falling into the
trap of looking as though they are conducting a love affair - or clinching a
business deal - by mumbling into the palm of their hand.

FT  13 JUN 94 / Sport: No question for courts to tackle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two sportsmen sit in a court of law. A judge decides, if, during the course
of a game, one of them was guilty of inflicting intentional injury upon the
other. It is a strange scenario. It seems inappropriate, almost to the point
of absurdity, that the elephantine weight of the judicial process should be
brought to bear upon that fleeting rush of blood, that momentary loss of
control, that ridiculous clash of wills; that it should be brought to bear
upon a 'tackle'.
Surely the person who inflicts intentional injury is the thug with the
jagged bottle? There might be a few such people on the terraces; but on the
pitch? How can the two arenas be in any way compared? Does not the question
of guilt or innocence, so clear-cut in the case of the football hooligan,
become amorphous and - again - inappropriate when applied to the essentially
unreal world of the game?
Yet the question has been raised over the past few weeks. Ex-Chelsea player
Paul Elliott had his knee and his career wrecked in a tackle by Dean
Saunders (then of Liverpool, now of Aston Villa), and took Saunders to court
for compensation. In order to receive any money, Elliott had to establish
that Saunders' tackle was reckless or dangerous; that he had been going for
the man and not the ball. This question, one of the most commonplace in
football and snap-judged by referees perhaps every week in the season, had,
through the severity of Elliott's injury, become a different question;
whether Saunders was guilty or innocent.
Yet it is hard to believe that anyone in the case thought of it in that way.
Surely Elliott didn't really believe that Saunders was 'guilty' of anything?
Surely there was some deliberate, if necessary, obfuscation of the issue;
Elliott wanted money, rather than the condemnation of Saunders, but he could
not get the first without the second?
It was an absurd situation; not because of the claim itself, which Elliott
had every right to make, but because of the way in which he had to make it.
It wasn't even as if the question of guilt or innocence was easy to judge.
Certainly the effects of the tackle were horrific, but one might see any
number that look more obviously reckless. This added another level of
absurdity to proceedings, as a parade of witnesses passed solemnly thought
the court to tell it whether or not they thought Saunders had been going for
the ball. The final absurdity came when Mr Justice Drake, having listened to
this minutely observed evidence, decided he would, after all and
nonetheless, abide by the instant judgment of the match officials. At the
time of the collision, the referee had awarded the free kick to Liverpool;
and the referee is always right.
It is interesting to imagine what would have happened had the tackle been
completely indefensible. In the Elliott case, the question of whether or not
a sportsman can be adjudged guilty in a court of law, for a misdemeanour
committed on a playing field, was obscured by the attention given to whether
or not Dean Saunders was guilty of 'anything'. Everybody was absorbed in the
little intricacies of what had happened two years ago. Nobody had to address
the larger muddle that is happening now. Sport was let off the hook by the
fact that Elliott's case rested more on the dreadful effects of the tackle
than on the tackle itself. What might happen if a clearer case was brought,
in which no evidence could be given in favour of the sportsman who inflicted
the injury?
Another question would still remain; that of intent. It is hard enough to
say what motivates any sudden assault, and it would be almost impossible to
prove what lay within the impassioned convulsions that shake team sport.
Even that of Van der Bergh, the South African rugby player whose studs
ripped Jon Callard's head to shreds, could probably defend himself by saying
that in the heat of the moment he lost all consciousness of the fact that he
was walking around somebody's eye.
And Dean Saunders: even if his tackle on Paul Elliott had looked as wild as
the one in which Paul Gascoigne wrecked his own knee, who could ever prove
that there was intent behind it to harm another player? It is an accusation
which, again, is inappropriate. That is where guilt in the law court and
guilt on the playing field become two different things.
Sportsmen want to win; that desire can lead them to do things which are
sometimes stupid, and sometimes that stupidity can have serious
consequences. But the intention behind a sportsmen's actions is so confused
by aggression - the dangerous commodity with which he is always dealing -
that he himself would scarcely be able to analyse it. If the aggression is
badly directed, then he is playing bad sport. If it is directed to a more
deliberate, more sinister purpose, then he is not playing sport at all.

<TEXT>
It is called Mrs Ascher's Steamed Vegetable Torte and it tends to turn heads
when served in New York's Park Avenue Cafe, consisting as it does of a
brightly coloured tower of layered peppers, squashes, zuchinis, spinach,
cauliflower and broccoli, topped with a puree of eggplant, potato and leek.
The dish typifies the exuberant style of resident chef David Burke, one of
Manhattan's best known exponents of New American cuisine, who imaginatively
mixes traditional staples of US cooking with more exotic ingredients and
presents the dishes in dramatic fashion. Other examples of his art include
chilled lobster salad with toasted saffron, couscous, endive and candied
lemon; or carpaccio of marinated tuna and seaweed wrapped noodles.
The Park Avenue Cafe is a relative newcomer to New York's rich choice of top
quality restaurants. But over the past two years it has become a fashionable
alternative to Mid-town Manhattan's leading established exponents of
contemporary American cooking, namely Aureole, Arcadia, the Quilted Giraffe
and the Sign of the Dove.
The food is exciting (though some critics complain it is a little too
contrived), the wine list is strong, and the service is attentive, without
the American waiter's irritating tendency to over-familiarity.
It is a good place for business discussions because its tables tend to be
well spaced apart - unlike some of its cramped rivals, where you may find
yourself sharing your confidential negotiations with the next tables, or
your attention wandering to the much more fascinating details of a
neighbouring diner's love life.
The decor is conducive to both types of conversation, blending romantic
American country folk art with a dash of hard-edged city sophistication.
In short, it has the class one would hope for from a Park Avenue address,
without any of the stuffiness that often accompanies it.
A meal for two, including a decent bottle of wine, tax and a 20 per cent
tip, will cost Dollars 180 to Dollars 200.

FT  13 JUN 94 / Working Life: Dirty laundry - Reading Matter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sticking a real US dollar bill on the front cover of a book is almost
guaranteed to get an author noticed; unfortunately it is equally likely to
mean the book itself is so bad it needs that kind of hype to get anyone
interested.
The Laundrymen purports to tell the inside story of 'the world's third
largest business'; hyping bad books certainly looks like becoming the
world's second largest business. It does nothing of the sort. The Dollars 1
on the front cover is said to have a high statistical chance of containing
traces of cocaine; on that basis you would need about 500 copies of this
book to be able to conclude 'gee, that was a wow of a read'.
Sure, laundering money is a hugely-troubling phenomenon, destructive of
lives, economies, nations. And an authoritative book on the subject would be
a major event.
So what is the problem with this one? Leaving aside some of the more
egregious factual errors - I would relish the chance of flying in a
'Leerjet' (page 61), for example - its central flaw is, ironically, in
keeping with the subject matter.
For Jeffrey Robinson - or his publisher - encourages readers to think they
are getting something new, insightful and challenging. Whereas what is
actually on offer is a rather shoddily-written cuttings' job. Robinson knows
his way round the world's databases; he has sifted them all, it feels, in
the effort to track down established, already written-up, cases of clearly
proved money-laundering. For anyone interested in the subject, there is
nothing here which has not already been thoroughly cooked up elsewhere.
Robinson holds up for display - not contempt, exactly - a global rogue's
gallery of convicted criminals. But throughout I found myself asking: where
are the footnotes? That is not pedantry; in a book of this sort, we need to
be convinced that all the stuff which does not come from cuttings is
credible. Of course, Robinson can - and does - fall back on the defence of
confidentiality, though I did not have confidence in his deserving my trust.
One example from many possibilities, Robinson writes that 'apparently he's
(Fidel Castro) also approached the Chinese and the North Koreans, proposing
to help them develop their nuclear capacity in exchange for oil.' That
apparently speaks worrying volumes.
Most peculiarly of all, Robinson's style and tone clearly indicates that he
is half in love with the fast car, rich lifestyle, globe-trotting image of
the unsavoury characters he writes about. Imagine Hello magazine doing a
photo-spread on a Colombian drug baron; if that's your idea of a good read,
buy this book instantly.

FT  13 JUN 94 / Management: Yve Newbold - Desert Island Manager
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Yve Newbold is looking forward to her stay on a desert island. A whirlwind
of efficiency in her job as company secretary at Hanson, the Anglo-US
conglomerate, she would quickly have the island organised to her liking. Her
only worry is that she would settle in so well that she would find herself
composing a resignation letter to her boss, Lord Hanson, on some of the
electronic equipment she plans to take with her.
What would you need to carry on your business apart from a fax and a phone?
'A videophone. I could call up my kids and the bank manager, or see what the
traffic was like in downtown Naples. I like to be able to see people's
expressions.'
How would you keep your sanity?
'I would keep fit. I'd do water aerobics and wear those repulsive great big
arm bands and plastic dumb-bells and swing them through the water. I'd also
jog in the evening after the sun goes down.'
How would you busy yourself?
'I'm assuming my brain will soften a bit. So I would do computer games. It
would be better than taking back editions of the Times crosswords, which
would seem totally meaningless on a desert island.'
Who would accompany you?
'I have no doubt about that: I'd take my mother. She's Irish, very funny, a
great mimic, and she's my best friend. She is a most superb
conversationalist, we never run out of things to say. She'd be much better
than taking a partner. Imagine the frigid silences you'd have over who
finished the sun cream.'
What would you take for food and drink?
'I could not live without my plug-in filter coffee maker. Alternatively I'd
take Diet Coke. To eat I'd have something completely wicked and forbidden
like bacon sandwiches. I could easily eat those every day.'
Which book would you take?
'I'd have to look after my spiritual side, so it would be The Prophet by
Kahlil Gibran. It's a philosophical tract: a bit Zen, although Gibran is an
Arab.'
And which film?
'I'm very, very fond of horses, and as I couldn't have horses on the desert
island, I'd take instead National Velvet with Elizabeth Taylor. I could
watch it again and again, and sob every time.'
How well would you adapt?
'Quite well, I think. If I were allowed a pen knife I'd make myself a house.
If birds can do it with their beaks, I could certainly do it with my two
hands. I'd like the chance to develop a sense of perspective away from the
mad daily rush of London life.'
What would you most dislike?
'I hate blistering sun, so I'd need to take my factor 25.'
What message would you send back?
'It would be to my children saying - I know this sounds mawkish and
sentimental - remember I love you and I hope you are behaving yourself.'

FT  13 JUN 94 / Management: Quitting to pursue other euphemisms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Let me take this chance to wish John Precious, the outgoing finance director
at Wellcome, every success in pursuing his other opportunities. I am,
however, curious to know what they are. They must be pretty special to have
persuaded him to quit a prestigious job with a salary of Pounds 200,000 or
more.
I would like to know, and I think shareholders have a right to know, a
little more about why he is leaving. When a director quits his post suddenly
it is not good enough for a company to offer a limp cliche by way of
explanation. I'm sure there is nothing untoward about Precious's departure -
especially as he has kindly agreed to stay put until a replacement can be
found - it is just a shame that Wellcome chose to explain his departure in
woolly terms guaranteed to raise the suspicions of sceptics.
'Pursuing other opportunities' or 'interests' can mean that the guy was no
good and has been fired; that he disagrees with the company's policy; that
he cannot get on with his colleagues; that he has had a better job offer; or
that he has had a mid-life crisis and wants to generate his own electricity
on a farm.
The phrase is just one in a collection wheeled out for senior resignations
and sackings. Some directors who depart in a hurry cite a desire to 'spend
more time with the family', while others refer to 'clash of management
styles'. This last one is less opaque, as it usually means there has been a
mighty row.
The reluctance to explain is regrettable. It is also understandable. Celsis,
a biotechnology company, recently fired its chief executive claiming that
his performance had been wanting. Now the company is being sued both for
unfair dismissal and defamation.
It is a pity that the law encourages companies to mince their words.
Directors are paid a great deal of money, and if they do not deliver the
goods they deserve to be sacked, and shareholders deserve to be told about
it. If truth were the norm, there would be no niggling suspicions when a
director genuinely found that the pull of those other interests was
irresistible.
I was intrigued to read that the president of the Board of Trade is
considering an investigation into the affairs of Impregnators Ltd. It seems
there was an ugly scene at the company's agm, with shareholders making
allegations and directors stonewalling.
What surprised me about this snippet was that it appeared in the June 7 1944
edition of the Financial Times reprinted last week. According to the rest of
the media's D-Day extravaganza the world has changed beyond recognition in
50 years, but the old copy of the FT proves that, in business, matters are
much the same. In addition to the thoroughly modern tale of corporate
corruption, the news of 1944 included familiar sounding payoffs to directors
losing their jobs.
The stories may be the same, but the way we tell them is not. In those days
there was no need to present events as exciting, nor to explain them.
Neither was there a market for clever comment. Autolycus, the Lex of the
time, spent D-Day explaining that J. and J. Coleman was shortly to go
ex-dividend, and forecast that the share price then would be the same as
today, minus the dividend - unless there was any 'change in the meantime'.
I'm not sure if today's ultra-discerning readers would feel happy paying 65p
for that insight.
Over breakfast the other day I found myself having a row with my husband
over the unlikely issue of absenteeism. The discussion was amiable enough
until he declared that women were off sick more than men.
To prove him wrong, I phoned the people who research this sort of thing,
like the Confederation of British Industry and the Institute of Personnel
Management, to find they had no relevant figures. That didn't stop them
speculating: some said it was the men, others that it was the women who were
the skivers.
Finally, I tracked down an unpublished study at the Equal Opportunities
Commission showing that women are off sick 5 per cent of the time, while men
are only off 4 per cent. I would have let the matter drop quietly had it not
been for the explanation. The difference is entirely due to women staying at
home to look after sick children. 'Just what I thought,' said my husband,
when I triumphantly presented the evidence. I wonder how many men take time
off having been assaulted by their wives?
Still on the subject of the sexes, the Equal Opportunities Unit in Brussels
takes a novel approach to the differences between them. Prospective
employees must complete a form that asks them their sex, giving them the
option of m or f. The corresponding footnote explains: 'Indicate your
choice'.
This is the last week for nominations for the FT Mean Boss Award. The
winners will be announced on June 20.

FT  13 JUN 94 / Management: Boardroom imports down under - A wave of
American executive appointments in Australia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Australia has often been called the 51st state - a lighthearted reference to
the proliferation of Hollywood films, fast-food restaurants and baseball
caps. But now, at a rather more fundamental level, is American management
culture infiltrating Australian boardrooms?
The thought has been prompted by a spate of top executive appointments at
some of Australia's biggest companies. Last month, for example, the
Australian Mutual Provident, the nation's largest life insurer and a pillar
of its institutional investment community, named George Trumbull as its new
chief executive. Trumbull comes to the AMP from Cigna, the giant
Philadelphia-based insurer, where he was president of the individual
financial services division and former investment chief.
Last year Bob Joss, a former Wells Fargo executive, was appointed to head
Westpac, the oldest of Australia's 'big four' commercial banks. In 1992,
Telecom, the large state-owned telecommunications company, recruited Frank
Blount from AT&amp;T, the US telecoms group, as chief executive.
This importation has seeped down to lower management levels, too. Last
month, for example, Coles Myer, one of Australia's biggest retailers,
appointed Dennis Eck to run its supermarkets division. Eck is a former
executive vice-president of American Stores and, more recently, worked for
California-based Vons Supermarkets.
But despite these eye-catching moves, executive search firms and management
consultants remain divided about how pervasive the importation of US talent
actually is. Geoff Morgan, at Morgan &amp; Banks, the executive recruitment
specialist, describes the development as 'a definite trend', pointing out
that the Trumbull/Joss/Blount appointments were all the results of
full-blown searches conducted outside Australia.
He thinks the pattern stems partly from a desire for the general management
skills and objectivity which US executives can offer, and partly from the
need for sector-specific experience. The latter element, he predicts, will
mean that the influx continues, especially in service industries where
'Australian companies don't have a great reputation', and in high-tech
fields.
This view seems well supported by Coles: it lists four specific skills where
it reckoned Eck had an edge, ranging from inventory management to
technological expertise, especially in supplier relationships. The
Australian retailer notes, too, that it has a major refurbishment programme
getting under way, and that Eck has handled more than 1,000 store overhauls.
But David Benn, managing director of consultants Korn/Ferry in Sydney -
whose strong American accent belies 20 years in Australia - reckons that the
development 'is not nearly as pervasive as the headline-grabbing stuff
suggests'.
For the most part, he suggests, US executives are being used as
trouble-shooters. 'I don't think anyone has had the brief: 'Go find an
American'. It (such appointments) tends to happen in situations where there
is a well-defined problem, and all other bets are off,' he says.
Telecom, he points out, was (and is) facing the loss of its protected
monopoly position. Westpac, having called itself Australia's world bank, had
strayed badly at home and shareholder disgruntlement was swelling.
Australia's insurance sector faces major issues like the merits of
demutualisation and increased competition.
But at least some board directors, who have the formal say over such
appointments, seem to have been wooed by the promise of broad management
objectivity. One AMP director notes that the insurer did first consider an
internal promotion, but eventually shortlisted two candidates from outside
Australia. 'We decided it was better to select someone who was unencumbered
by AMP baggage', he says.
So if these are the expectations, are they realistic? Where US executives
have already been installed, there are some clear signs that international
perspective has quickly come into play.
Most of the recent US appointments, for example, have put a major emphasis
on raising service levels. Joss wants the bank to take McDonald's as its
management model, and emulate the US hamburger chain's route to consistent
quality. Reaching such a target, he has acknowledged, implies a strong
training focus. He has also stressed the need for a more targeted rewarding
of performance.
Meanwhile, Telecom, which remains state-owned and therefore hugely
political, says that greater use is now being made of techniques like
international 'benchmarking', especially in finance.
But there also are some signs that cultural differences - notably,
Australia's strong egalitarian beliefs - may not make for the easiest
transition of ideas. Already, executive remuneration is in the spotlight,
and the packages offered to the new breed of executives - whether
home-grown, like Tony Berg at Boral, or imported, like Joss - have been
much-debated.
On the plus side, institutional shareholders, anxious to lift their profile
in the wake of the 1980s 'entrepreneurial' excesses, say they are
supportive, provided the structure of an option package is 'appropriate'.
The Australian Investment Managers Group is currently drawing up guidelines
on the subject and on corporate governance matters generally.
The throwaway remark of one mining industry manager, asked about a recent
non-Australian appointment in his own company, seems to summarise the
attitudes which the stepped-up executive culture has yet to alter. 'We
haven't caught the Bob Joss syndrome if that's what you mean,' he comments.
'My family has been shareholders of Westpac for years and all I can say is
he'd better be worth it.'

FT  13 JUN 94 / Management: Shortage of top talent willing to move
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A recent international survey* conducted by two Harvard University
professors found that fewer than half the corporate participants were
training their executives for international assignments, even though 94 per
cent said such expertise would be of vital importance to the company in the
future. Instead, they relied heavily on recruitment from outside for
vacancies abroad.
That and similar trends revealed in the research mean the 'global executive'
should be able to name his price. The survey for Amrop Partners, the
international executive recruitment firm, was based on interviews with 1,000
senior executives in 30 countries, including Australia, and conducted by
Robin Ely at John F. Kennedy School of Government and Janice McCormick at
Harvard Business School.
It found that in general there is an acute shortage of
internationally-mobile managers, and that the problem is most severe for
multinationals attempting to operate in fast-developing regions such as
south-east Asia or eastern Europe.
Only 35 per cent of respondents said their companies offered access to
international management courses, while fewer than half provided
opportunities to develop language skills. Half those surveyed said fear of
losing touch with the company's central activities made them reluctant to go
abroad.
Financial considerations seem to be the strongest motivator for people to
work abroad. The three top 'strategic inducements' were relocation
assistance, a comparable benefits package and an attractive expatriate
financial package.
Australia was the only area in which the success rate in attracting
international executives outstripped the perceived need by a very wide
margin (over 20 percentage points) - perhaps because of the sandy beaches
and sunny climate.

FT  13 JUN 94 / Sale of BBC transmitters considered
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is exploring ways of trying to introduce private money and
expertise into the management of BBC transmitters.
Ministers hope to decide on the future of the BBC transmitters in the next
few weeks, but it is clear that the status quo - a wholly-owned BBC
transmitter system - is no longer an option. Full privatisation is also
unlikely, although it has not been formally ruled out.
The search for a preferred option on transmitters is the issue that has
delayed publication of the white paper on the future of the BBC.
A possible compromise revolves around a number of options ranging from
trying to bring in large outside commercial shareholders, or private
investment, to a form of management buy-out. In both cases the BBC would
retain a large - possibly even a majority - stake.
Outright privatisation was all but rejected months ago because of the
practical difficulties involved. In most cases the BBC and NTL, the
privatised arm of the old Independent Broadcasting Authority transmitter and
engineering division, share sites and maintenance.
The BBC showed that privatisation could cost the organisation as much as
Pounds 30m to Pounds 35m a year more than the present system. The issue has
recently been revived mainly, it appears, because of the political need to
be seen to be changing the structure of the BBC.
In the white paper, which may not emerge until next month, the intention is
to set out a preferred option on the future of transmitters.
The government is apparently trying to balance the need to retain the
advantages of co-operation provided by the existing system with creating
some competition for NTL in new business development.
There is the danger that the issue will be linked with the introduction of
digital television in the UK on existing terrestrial transmitters - a pet
scheme of the Department of Trade and Industry.
The BBC believes that the introduction of digital television, which could
provide many extra channels, would cost hundreds of millions of pounds.
The BBC has been surprised by the sudden change in the government's attitude
to transmitters and is still working through its position on the issue.
It hopes that the government will simply set out a range of options on the
future of its transmitters in the white paper, particularly if the complex
issue of digital television is linked with it in any way.

FT  13 JUN 94 / Developer faces writ for Pounds 16m transfer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Broome, the property developer behind Battersea Leisure, the scheme
that failed to redevelop the Battersea Power Station, is the subject of a
High Court writ concerning an unexplained cash transfer.
The writ, which was issued by the liquidator of Battersea Leisure on May 27,
concerns the transfer six years ago of Pounds 16m from Battersea Leisure to
Alton Towers, the Staffordshire theme park formerly run by Mr Broome.
Mr Alan Lewis of Arthur Andersen, accountants, liquidator of Battersea
Leisure, is seeking the return of the money. The protective writ was issued
just before the six-year time limit for bringing legal action ran out.
The proceedings were described as 'preposterous' by a spokesman for the
Broome Group. 'The Broome Group strenuously denies that the directors have
executed their responsibilities in any way other than with total correctness
concerning all financial arrangements in the group,' the spokesman said.
He added: 'It is understood that Arthur Andersen had not contacted the
company's accountants Touche Ross, due to time constraints, in order to
acquaint themselves with the relevant facts prior to issuing a protective
writ - which has not been served.'
Mr Broome's plans to redevelop Battersea Power station started in 1987 when
his company Battersea Group, formerly Alton Towers, acquired 85 per cent of
the Battersea site for Pounds 18m. But plans to turn it into a leisure
complex were halted in 1990, after the scheme ran out of funds. Battersea
Leisure eventually went into liquidation. Control of the site passed to
Parkview, a company owned by the Hwang Brothers of Hong Kong, which intends
to develop a hotel, office complex and leisure scheme.
In 1987, at the same time as Mr Broome's company bought its 85 per cent
stake of the Battersea site, Mr Broome bought 15 per cent of the site for
his own account. He then sold this minority stake at a sharply increased
price of Pounds 16.5m in 1988 to Alton Towers. Mr Broome was paid Pounds 11m
of the proceeds in the form of shares in Alton Towers, while he received the
remaining Pounds 5.5m in cash.
Mr Broome sold Alton Towers, the Staffordshire theme park, to Pearson, the
group that publishes the Financial Times, for Pounds 60m in March 1990.
The writ has been issued against ATB (Staffs) Ltd which is Mr Broome's
company, Mr Broome, his wife and two other directors of ATB (Staff) Ltd.

FT  13 JUN 94 / Tecs urge 'value for money' audits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Employer-led Training and Enterprise Councils have called for the Audit
Commission to conduct 'value for money' studies into them, in a move to fend
off criticisms that they have wasted Pounds 250m a year of public funds.
Tecs, which are responsible for administering government programmes worth
more than Pounds 2bn a year, are routinely audited by the National Audit
Office.
Two leading Tec chief executives, Mr Richard Guy and Mr John Howells,
recommend much wider studies into Tecs by the Audit Commission in a report
published today by the Policy Studies Institute.
The recommendations form part of their defence against criticism in a recent
study by Professor Robert Bennett of the London School of Economics, which
said that Tecs had failed to make efficiency savings worth Pounds 255m a
year and that only a handful of Tecs had radically reformed their structure
and operations.
Mr Guy and Mr Howells, chief executives of South and East Cheshire Tec and
Teesside Tec respectively, accept some of Prof Bennett's more general
comments about Tecs but say that his financial claims 'do not stand up', and
that the calculations rest 'on a succession of unsound comparisons'.
They say, however, that the Audit Commission has the resources, the
experience and expertise to apply consultancy-based methods as well as
carrying out normal financial audit.
They say: 'Tecs would benefit from the sort of cost-cutting studies which
the commission has carried out across local government and the health
service.'

FT  13 JUN 94 / Tunnel freight service to Milan starts tonight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Channel tunnel is to start a freight container service to Italy tonight.
Until now the UK rail network has provided few routes long enough to make
freight transport economic. The tunnel provides fast direct links to
Continental destinations.
The container service is being run by Combined Transport (CTL), a joint
venture owned by European haulage companies and British Rail's freight
division.
The first long-distance freight train carrying containers will leave
Wembley, west London, tonight and arrive in Milan early on Wednesday. Its
load will consist of containers and 'swapbodies' - bodies which can be
detached from a lorry chassis.
The inaugural train will carry 20 to 22 containers or swapbodies, each
holding a cargo weighing up to 50 tonnes. The through-tunnel train will
consist of loads from Glasgow, Manchester and Birmingham.
The service will initially consist of two or three trains a day to and from
France, Switzerland, Luxembourg and Italy. From September the service will
extend to destinations in Austria and Spain. Mr Francois Leclercq, CTL
managing director, said Germany might be added but it was proving difficult
to obtain attractive rates for German destinations.
Journey times should be about half those by road and much less than the time
taken by rail and ferry. Glasgow to Paris is expected to take 21 hours,
Manchester to Milan 33 hours and London to Madrid 36 hours.
An evacuation rehearsal of a Channel Tunnel passenger train was marred on
Saturday by a power failure that stalled the train in the tunnel with 800
people on it. The incident was caused by a short-circuit, and the train was
towed to England by a conventional diesel engine.
Passenger services are scheduled to start next month.

FT  13 JUN 94 / Cages 'cause extreme suffering' to battery hens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Battery cages cause extreme suffering to egg-laying hens, a government
adviser on animal health has found after a wide-ranging review of scientific
evidence.
Mr Mike Baxter, director of Brunel University's Design Centre, concluded
that hens suffer in a number of ways by not being able to perform natural
functions in very small cages. His report, published today, is likely to add
to pressure on the government to restrict battery farming.
Groups such as the animal welfare society the RSPCA have long campaigned for
battery farming to be banned. About 85 per cent - or 40m - of Britain's
egg-laying hens are kept in battery cages. Last month the Commons
agriculture committee in a report on the poultry industry concluded that a
ban on battery cages would not be a realistic propo-sition.
The committee said: 'Non-cage systems have their own welfare drawbacks and
any wholesale switch to alternative systems would not necessarily enhance
the overall welfare of laying hens.'
The government says it is pushing Brussels to review European Union rules on
battery hens. New regulations come into force in January, increasing the
amount of space each hen must have from 450 sq cm to 600 sq cm.
The egg industry has said that the costs of any further changes in the
regulations would be too great a burden.
Mr Baxter, who sits on the government's Farm Animal Welfare Council, says in
his report in The Veterinary Record that hens are unable to perform natural
nesting functions in a wire mesh cage. There is nowhere for them to perch,
they cannot indulge in dust-bathing or foraging and their bones are weakened
by lack of movement.
The Farm Animal Welfare Council was set up by the government in 1979 as an
independent body to advise on legislation. The council has not yet made any
official recommendations on battery hens.

FT  13 JUN 94 / Councils divided on local government review
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Councils in several counties are bitterly divided over the local government
review on the eve of the announcement of the first final proposals from the
Local Government Commission.
Proposals to reorganise councils in Cambridgeshire, Cheshire, Cumbria, Kent
and Oxfordshire will be announced today with Bedfordshire, Berkshire,
Buckinghamshire, Hampshire and Lancashire following by the end of the week.
The commission will then launch a public consultation in an attempt to find
consensus on whether boundaries should be redrawn and on whether the current
two-tier system of counties and districts should be replaced by all-purpose
'unitary' authorities. But councils in several of the counties affected are
bitterly divided over the review while the commission appears to be at
loggerheads with the government.
Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, has said he wants unitary solutions
to emerge in most cases, but the commission is expected to recommend keeping
two tiers for most of Hampshire and Kent. In all the other counties involved
the commission will recommend unitary authorities to be created by merging
existing district councils. Sir John Banham, commission chairman, said last
week that the level of support for unitary councils in the shires was 'very
low indeed', and said he did not want to see a 'Balkanisation of local
government'.
Backbench Conservative MPs from Kent and Hampshire have announced support
for the two-tier status quo, while Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary,
has said that he prefers the status quo in his home county of Oxfordshire.
All proposals to reorganise counties must be passed by parliament.
Lobbyists for county councils believe their best chance to force concessions
from the government comes this month, after it has been weakened by results
in parliamentary by-elections and the European elections.

FT  13 JUN 94 / Both sides upbeat in BBC dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Both sides in the industrial dispute at the BBC yesterday appeared
optimistic that talks today at Acas, the conciliation service, could lead to
a settlement of the action which has already halted programmes for two
24-hour periods, Diane Summers writes.
Bectu, the main technical union, and the NUJ journalists' union called off
action planned for yesterday and dropped plans for a stoppage tomorrow.
The dispute is about the implementation of performance pay and the
decentralisation to individual BBC directorates of negotiations on some
terms of employment.
BBC management said it hoped that once certain reassurances and
clarifications had been given at Acas the unions would 'feel free to put the
matter to a ballot of their members with a recommendation to accept' the
package. The corporation emphasised that it was 'not in a position to move
any further' on the substance of the offer.

FT  13 JUN 94 / Building material deficit declines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's trade deficit in building materials fell 16.7 per cent last year
to Pounds 1.44bn - the lowest since 1986.
The improvement was led by a 15 per cent rise in the value of exports, which
increased from Pounds 2.3bn to Pounds 2.6bn, figures published by the
Department of the Environment show.
There is concern, however, that the deficit might rise again when material
bottlenecks start to emerge as the construction industry recovers. The
prices of a number of British-produced materials and components have risen
sharply this year.
Sales abroad by British companies have been boosted by the 1992 devaluation
of sterling and by large productivity gains.
Last year's improvement in exports is encouraging because continental
Europe, the main overseas market for British building materials, was itself
in deep recession.
British steel suppliers and fabricators have been particularly successful in
breaking into Continental markets. The trade surplus in structural steel,
for example, rose last year from Pounds 65.3m to Pounds 179.9m.
The surplus in steel reinforcing bars for concrete doubled from Pounds 39.3m
to Pounds 80.9m, while the surplus on steel tubes and pipes increased 46 per
cent to Pounds 65.78m.
British manufacturers of other building products also saw substantial gains
last year, with the trade surplus on wallpaper rising 43 per cent to Pounds
141.9m.
Imports of building materials rose only 1.5 per cent to Pounds 4.1bn. Of
this, more than Pounds 1bn was due to the importation of raw and
semi-finished timber. Much of this is hardwood which Britain is unable to
produce.
Ministers have repeatedly criticised the construction industry for the high
level of imports, which peaked at Pounds 4.7bn in 1989, causing a record
deficit of Pounds 2.8bn. There will be continuing concern about the high
level of imports of some manufactured products, even though the overall
total has reduced substantially.
Decorative glazed ceramic tiles, for example, incurred a trade deficit of
Pounds 79.6m last year, although this was less than the previous year's
Pounds 102.5m. Builders' ironmongery, such as doorknobs and other small
items, had a trade deficit of Pounds 195.3m last year, only slightly down on
the previous year's Pounds 197.87m.

FT  13 JUN 94 / PM deals blow to Post Office sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The prime minister has ordered Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry
secretary, to redraft plans for privatisation of the Post Office. The move
is another setback for politicians and industrialists who want to see the
organisation sold.
Whitehall officials say Mr John Major has rejected an early draft of a green
paper by the Department of Trade and Industry on the privatisation of Royal
Mail and Parcelforce, the parcels arm.
The draft, which was due to be published in the next few weeks, is
understood to have leaned heavily in favour of Mr Heseltine's plans to
privatise 51 per cent of the Post Office, leaving the remainder of the stock
in government hands.
But, according to one Whitehall official, Mr Major has told Mr Heseltine
that the document does not give sufficient weight to the option of leaving
the Post Office completely in the public domain - an option backed by many
Tory backbenchers.
A Whitehall official said yesterday: 'The hope is that that the green paper
would have something in it other than the privatisation option. A green
paper is a broad-ranging document and needs to look at absolutely
everything.'
The setback to Mr Heseltine's plans comes amid growing uncertainty among
Tory MPs about whether the Post Office should be sold.
A number of Conservative MPs believe the organisation has a crucial social
function and that its privatisation would be highly unpopular with the
public.
But rightwing MPs - who are backed on this issue by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the
chancellor - are urging the government to press ahead with privatisation.
Government business managers have warned ministers that as a result of these
differences it may be difficult to guarantee the passage of a privatisation
bill through the next session of parliament.
Mr Major's decision to block the green paper is the latest blow to Mr
Heseltine's plans for the Post Office.
Originally, Mr Heseltine had wanted to privatise the entire Royal Mail and
Parcelforce but was urged to accept only a partial sell-off.
Mr Heseltine has since made a range of concessions to backbench MPs,
including a commitment to universal tariffs and the exemption of stamps from
value added tax.

FT  13 JUN 94 / Idyllic fortress ready to lower drawbridge: Tiny Alderney is
a victim of its own success
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JENNY LUESBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Alderney in the Channel Islands has run out of money, which is no mean feat
for an island where Lloyd's Names make up nearly 2 per cent of the
population and almost half the residents are independently wealthy.
For decades the island has thrived as the fulfilment of an idyll. Alderney
has its own parliament, civil service, airport, hospital, golf course,
sailing club, newspaper and banks - and fewer than 2,400 residents. All the
inhabitants and institutions are squeezed into an island just 3 1/2 miles
long by 1 1/2 miles wide without damaging the rhythm of rural life.
But the island's very success in selling itself as a haven from the 20th
century has been its undoing.
Residents who have chosen to live in Alderney because of its peace and
seclusion have fought to preserve it from change, just as others have sought
to increase their prosperity and comfort through further development.
This conflict of interest came to a head five years ago when
conservationists united against a local entrepreneur's proposal to reopen a
granite quarry.
The dispute was bitter for an island renowned for its friendliness and
goodwill, spilling over into demonstrations and boycotts. But the campaign
was successful and the quarry scheme was cancelled.
This success boosted the preservation lobby and was rapidly followed by
measures to slow the property market, which had continued to flourish as
that of the UK declined. The island's States, or parliament, introduced a
100 per cent property tax on profits made by selling a house within five
years of its purchase.
Investors stopped buying houses on Alderney, and so did many people looking
for second homes or towards a future retirement on the island. In just two
years, the revenue from the local property transaction tax, known as conge,
was halved.
More measures followed. Legislation was adopted to prevent the sale of new
houses to settlers. And the more outspoken conservationists started pushing
to turn the island's village centre, St Anne, into a conservation area.
The effect of pulling up the drawbridge against future settlers and of
limiting change and development on the island was to tie Alderney's fortunes
inextricably to those of its existing settlers.
Last year the combined effect of the Lloyd's syndicates' losses and falling
interest rates saw Alderney's income-tax revenue fall 18 per cent. The
deficit ate much of the island's capital reserve account, built up from past
surpluses. This year's projected deficit seems set to finish the job,
forcing Alderney to turn to Guernsey to make up the shortfall.
Since 1948 Guernsey has provided Alderney's core services under a deal
designed to help the islanders on their return to an island devastated
during the second world war. Alderney levies its taxes at Guernsey rates and
passes the revenue to Guernsey, which charges for the services it provides
before allowing Alderney to manage the surplus.
Alderney, like the other Channel Islands, is not constitutionally part of
the UK. It is part of the bailiwick of Guernsey, which is itself a Crown
possession. The governor of Guernsey is also governor of Alderney, but
Alderney's parliament petitions directly to the Privy Council.
Alderney and Guernsey also levy the same taxes, and Alderney passes its tax
revenue to Guernsey in return for the provision of core services. Because of
this agreement, two members of the States of Alderney represent the island
in the Guernsey States of Deliberation, or parliament.
Alderney's external affairs and treaties come under the jurisdiction of the
British parliament and are handled by the UK's Foreign Office.
Alderney is bound by EU external trade arrangements and agricultural
policies. But it is not affected by EU taxation, employment or any other
policy area.
A clause in the 1948 deal between Alderney and Guernsey, all but forgotten
until this year's financial crisis, obliges Guernsey to cover a deficit from
its own funds when Alderney cannot meet its expenses. Nevertheless, Alderney
cannot rely on Guernsey to go on subsidising it.
As Mr George Baron, Alderney's president, points out, no agreement is
binding for ever, and there is every chance that Guernsey and Alderney would
be forced to consider an alternative arrangement if the deficit continued.
Meanwhile, Alderney cannot raise its income tax rate from Guernsey's 20 per
cent, and if it cuts its services it may deter the present and future
settlers on whom it depends for its revenue. In 1992 income tax accounted
for more than two-thirds of Alderney's revenue. With preservation so
recently the order of the day, Alderney has been left with only one choice,
and that is to develop the island to increase its income.
Mr Baron said: 'Either we accept change, or we lose our autonomy.' And
Alderney has started to accept change. Six months ago the elections for the
presidency and four seats on the 12-member States swept away the
conservationist majority. The property tax law was promptly overturned, and
recent months have seen a flurry of development schemes.
The island has long been deadlocked over whether it should build a marina
which would provide protection from the north and north-easterly winds that
the natural harbour lacks. A consensus is forming in favour of this.
The States has launched a competitive tender for the Pounds 8m redevelopment
of one of the Victorian forts that ring the island - and it is no longer
confining its possible uses to activities as low-key as, perhaps, a study
centre. It might be a hotel. It might even house a casino.
And the mood is for more houses that can be sold to settlers or islanders,
on an island which is changing and developing in an effort to balance its
need for conservation against its need for revenue.

The 'brain drain' of scientists continues unabated, with one in five of the
UK's recently qualified PhD scientists going overseas for further study or
employment, the Institute of Manpower Studies says today.
The IMS found, however, that UK industry is suffering no shortage of
high-quality scientists, while unemployment levels for recently qualified
PhDs are only about 3 per cent.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Neil Kinnock, the former Labour leader, has said that he would have
devalued sterling in the exchange rate mechanism had his party won the last
general election.
In an interview for Channel 4, to be broadcast on Wednesday, Mr Kinnock says
Labour had to maintain 'an impression' during the 1992 campaign that it
would not devalue. But it would have abandoned the commitment because of the
need to pull Britain out of recession, he says.

FT  13 JUN 94 / Row over oil tax set to widen
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A tax dispute between the Inland Revenue and some UK oil companies could
widen this week as additional companies review whether to join Elf
Enterprise and Lasmo in issuing writs against the Revenue.
The dispute is over interpretations of provisions in the 1990 Finance Act on
interest payments on tax rebates in previous years.
The Revenue said the act capped the amount of release a company could offset
against past profits. The heart of the dispute is the Revenue's claim that
total relief should not exceed a company's current loss.
Lasmo, the independent explorer, issued a writ on Friday for Pounds 33m.
Earlier Elf Enterprise, the joint venture between Elf Acquitaine of France
and Enterprise Oil, the UK's largest independent, issued one for Pounds 70m.

Lucas Industries, a leading automotive components manufacturer, is to
announce today that is to build a plant at Houghton-Le-Spring, Tyne and
Wear, where it will create about 650 jobs in the next 18 months, Kevin Done
writes.
The plant will be built by Lucas SEI Wiring Systems, a joint venture formed
in 1990 between the UK group and Sumitomo Electric Industries of Japan.
The plant will make wiring harnesses and will help to meet growing demand
from Lucas' biggest wiring systems customers - Honda, Rover, Toyota and
Jaguar.
Production at the plant is expected to start early next year and investment
in the project is likely to total between Pounds 15m and Pounds 20m.

FT  13 JUN 94 / Closure of insolvency files sparks fraud fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Official files on thousands of liquidations and bankruptcies are to be
earmarked for rapid closure in a move that will raise fears that they will
escape adequate investigation for potential fraud.
Staff at the government's Insolvency Service are under instructions to
identify at least 11,000 cases to be closed without detailed examination
between today and July 8, according to an internal memo obtained by the
Financial Times.
That target is more than half the number of cases completed by the service
last year, and comes in response to ministerial pressure to reduce a backlog
of files as rapidly as possible.
The memo, written earlier this month by Mr Michael Osborne, the senior
official receiver, warns that the number of investigative reports carried
out by the agency will be cut below its plans.
An attached guidance note says: 'You will need to review the file
thoroughly, but not in depth. Do not spend time on . . . potential offences
or possible areas of investigation. It is anticipated that on average it
will not be necessary to spend more than an hour on each review.'
The drive to close more files follows the National Audit Office's criticisms
of the Insolvency Service for failing to seek disqualification of a greater
proportion of company directors who have broken the law.
Mr Keith Ellis, chairman of the insolvency-service branch of the Institute
of Professional and Managerial Staffs, the civil-service union, said: 'It
would appear that cases will be swept under the carpet because of these
instructions.
'If the Insolvency Service is there to investigate offences the government
should give us more resources.'
He said he believed the action was being taken as part of a move to speed up
the privatisation of the service. A large backlog of cases would make it
less attractive and more costly for potential private-sector providers.
But the Department of Trade and Industry said: 'These are old cases that
have already been examined, but the department did not have the resources to
see fully through to the end. When vetting takes place it is not going to be
a rubber stamp. There are going to be safeguards in place.'
Existing staff at Official Receivers' offices around the country are being
asked during the next month to identify the extra files to be closed from
cases of bankruptcy and company failure that are more than six months old.
These case files will then be forwarded to a special office in Manchester
for formal 'closure', which will be mainly conducted by junior casual
employees drafted in for the purpose.
The total completed last year was 21,126 against a target of 24,000.

FT  13 JUN 94 / Nadir chase leads to dark side of Cyprus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In a week when much of the Turkish press has been following Mrs Aysegul
Nadir and her alleged connections with antiques racketeers and shadowy
Moslem terrorists, her former husband, the founder and former head of Polly
Peck International, has gone largely unnoticed.
But the administrators trying to gain control of Polly Peck International,
the collapsed fruit-to-electronics group, believe Mr Asil Nadir has been far
from idle. They suspect the fugitive tycoon, who jumped bail in the UK where
he faces theft and false accounting charges, has been trying to obstruct
them.
That is how they see the mugging in Istanbul last week of their man on the
spot. Mr Christopher Howel, a Coopers &amp; Lybrand accountant, was left with a
head wound that needed six stitches. The attack might have been far worse
but for the intervention of Mr Howel's concierge.
In Cyprus business has long had its dark side and in such a close-knit
community anyone who has co-operated with the UK investigators has been a
potential target. Voodoo-style warnings - using headless chickens and dead
cats - have been used to frighten off the local officials who have
co-operated with the administrators and the car of the administrators' local
lawyer was blown up - without injuring any-one.
If the latest incident is connected to this intimidation it would suggest
the campaign is being taken to the mainland.
What exactly is at stake in the battle for Polly Peck's assets is hard to
judge. In PPI's 1989 accounts the 'near and Middle East' companies accounted
for profits of Pounds 107m out of a group total of Pounds 161m. The
administrators have been unable lay their hands on the Turkish and Cypriot
assets. As a result the value of the assets - and the likely remuneration
for PPI's 20,000 creditors - has remained a mystery.
Some progress is being made. This month, after 23 different injunctions
preventing their access to the local companies, a Cypriot court found in
favour of the administrators and prevented Mr Nadir from disposing of the
Crystal Cove Hotel, a former Greek property which PPI leased from the
Saudi-based Dar al Maal al Islamia foundation.
The Cypriot assets comprise a packaging business, a fruit trader and three
hotels. However, the lease for the Crystal Cove - unlike the other PPI
assets on the island which are owned through local companies - is held
directly by PPI. The hotel remains half-built after suffering bomb damage
during the Turkish invasion in 1974. The court action means that Mr Nadir's
plans to obtain a casino licence for the property, which would provide the
money for new owners to be able to rebuild, have been blocked.
And earlier this month the appeal court in Ankara allowed the administrators
to take control of printers AN Graphics, worth several million pounds.
Bribery allegations against the administrators issued by Mr Nadir's lawyers
have been thrown out by the courts. Mr Nadir's legal efforts are not
exhausted, however. The administrators now face criminal charges, after an
investigation by the Istanbul public prosecutor into the sale of Media
Print, an Istanbul publisher.
The case still stands after a hearing last week demanded that the
administrators give evidence. Because of the attack on one of their
officials the administrators are unlikely to want to appear in Turkey in
person, instead they will use sworn depositions.
Their hope is that the attack will refocus the attention of Turkish and
Cypriot authorities on the unco-operative behaviour of a man whom one senior
Turkish official described as the Robin Hood of the eastern Mediterranean.

FT  13 JUN 94 / Job prospects 'best for four years'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The most optimistic outlook for job prospects for four years is reported
today in the latest survey by Manpower UK, the recruitment organisation.
No region is forecasting job cuts in the three months to September, with the
east Midlands remaining the most positive for the second successive quarter.
London continues to show a marked improvement in job prospects - last year
it was the most pessimistic. Only the north-west and Scotland are
forecasting a worse position than in the same period last year.
The survey, which is based on responses from 2,165 employers, showed 26 per
cent of employers forecasting job increases and 11 per cent forecasting job
losses, resulting in a positive net balance of 15 per cent.
The manufacturing sector is the most optimistic about job prospects.
Significant jobs growth is also forecast in the building sector, with the
private building sector forecasting the greatest increase in jobs over any
industry covered by the survey. The public sector remains the weakest, with
local government still affected by the large increase in contracted out
services.
Ms Lilian Bennett, head of Manpower UK, said: 'There is still a sharp focus
by managers on increased productivity, improvement of quality standards and
greater flexibility of labour, which augurs well for the fourth quarter.'

FT  13 JUN 94 / Merseyside companies increase turnover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Research into the performance of privately-owned, medium-sized companies in
the recession has uncovered unexpected resilience, with turnover and profits
growing steadily and the number of employees increasing.
The work has been done on Merseyside, one of Britain's most
economically-distressed areas, which is getting more than Pounds 600m of EU
special funding in the next six years to try to catch up with average
European performance.
The Liverpool office of KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy firm, has
analysed the filed results of 993 unquoted independent companies in
Merseyside and the local contributions of 551 subsidiaries of national or
international companies.
A majority - 852 independents and 340 subsidiaries - are small, with sales
of less than Pounds 5m a year each. Most sales were generated by the 141
independents and 211 subsidiaries turning over more than Pounds 5m each.
Their combined sales figures totalled Pounds 10.85bn in 1992-93, compared
with Pounds 9.17bn two years earlier.
Among the 141 medium-sized and large independents aggregate turnover rose
nearly 18 per cent over three years - from nearly Pounds 2.1bn in 1990-91 to
nearly Pounds 2.5bn in 1992-93. Profits grew 57 per cent over the three
years - from Pounds 54m in 1990-91 to Pounds 85m in 1992-93.
Shareholders' funds rose 29 per cent to Pounds 488m, so corporate net worth
improved. So did the number of jobs, with the 141 independent companies
employing 21,997 in 1992-93 compared with 20,951 in 1990-91.
Mr Tim Beer, who is setting up a north-west regional unit for KPMG dealing
only with owner-managed businesses, said yesterday: 'Medium-sized companies
based on Merseyside have been able to weather the storm of the recession,
possibly better than other sectors or areas of the UK.

FT  13 JUN 94 / Two banks expect rates to stay down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The assumption that UK interest rates will rise to 6 per cent before the end
of the year has been challenged by two leading City banks.
A report today by Midland Global Markets, the foreign exchange wing of
Midland Bank, forecasts interest rates will fall by the end of the year to 5
per cent from the current 5.25 per cent.
And a Lloyds Bank report says the world has entered a period of low
inflation and low interest rates and it expects no rise in UK rates this
year.
These predictions run against the grain of the sterling futures markets,
where dealers are predicting base rates will rise to 6 per cent at the end
of the year as the Bank of England seeks to counter inflationary pressures.
A Gallup survey found that growing concern about inflation was prompting
most City fund managers to revise interest rate expectations upwards.
Midland Global markets says these fears are overstated, and the output gap
will be sufficient to stave off any inflation threat for at least two years.

FT  13 JUN 94 / Plants from Argentina rescue home-grown crop
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
English strawberries are as much an essential part of the British summer as
the Wimbledon tennis tournament and racing at Ascot, but this year's crop
could well come from plants shipped from Argentina last year.
Britain's Pounds 80m strawberry industry - the bulk of it is concentrated in
England - has managed to manipulate the growing season for its crop to such
an extent that it can ensure a steady flow of strawberries from April until
early October.
In the face of rising demand English fruit farmers have extended the
boundaries of the traditional three-week season.
Plants from typical English varieties are cultivated in Argentina and
shipped to Britain while still dormant from the southern winter. They start
to produce fruit much later in the season.
Other plants will have spent the past few months in the deep freeze, which
means they can be planted out later in June and July to produce fruit in
early September.
Discerning customers are so eager for English fruit that in the early
season, when fruit is grown under glass, they are prepared to pay almost
twice as much as for Spanish and US strawberries.
Mr Simon Brice, who has 1m plants in his cold store at Mockbeggar Farm near
Higham, Kent, said: 'We've always grown a few late berries but now there's
such huge demand for English strawberries. The supermarkets are not
interested in anyone who has a three-week season for anything.'
Mr Brice, who sells 500 tonnes of strawberries a year, said that about half
of the nation's strawberries are now eaten outside the traditional season,
compared with about 30 per cent 10 years ago.
He said: 'For every three strawberries we sell in Wimbledon fortnight, we
want one in August and half of one in September.'
Mr Richard Harnden, managing director at Commercial Fruit Plants on Romney
Marsh, Kent, has pioneered the growing of plants in Argentina. These plants
are being frozen for the trip back to Britain, where they are planted in
greenhouses in late July. They produce their first crop in September and
early October and manage to fruit again in April the following year.
Mr Harnden's initial trials with relatively small numbers of plants have
been so successful that he is hoping to expand significantly next year.
Young British-grown plants go into cold store in January and February, but
by the time they are planted out in July they are beginning to exhaust their
reserves of starch, making them weaker and more vulnerable than their
southern-hemisphere counterparts.
Mr Brice said the young plants had to be mollycoddled to protect them from
disease and dehydration. 'Once they are planted out, the fight is on for the
plant to grow an adequate root system to support its flowers,' he said.
The fields at Mockbeggar Farm are regularly sprinkled by automatically
activated irrigation sprays to reduce stress on the plants. But more often
than not Mr Brice is struggling to harvest his fruit in the drizzly
conditions of a typical British summer.

FT  13 JUN 94 / Blair and Prescott in clash over jobs targets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Full employment emerged as the central issue in Labour's leadership election
yesterday as Mr John Prescott and Mr Tony Blair clashed over whether a
Labour government should set targets for cuts in unemployment.
As Mr Ken Livingstone joined four other candidates seeking to succeed the
late John Smith, a poll for Granada Television confirmed that Mr Blair,
shadow home secretary, is the most popular candidate among voters.
The poll, which was not restricted to Labour members, gave Mr Blair 42 per
cent support. Mr Prescott, shadow employment secretary, won 30 per cent, Mrs
Margaret Beckett, acting leader, 23 per cent, and Mr Denzil Davies, a former
treasury minister, 5 per cent.
Mr Blair, the candidate of Labour's dominant modernist wing, warned on BBC
Breakfast with Frost that Labour should avoid setting unemployment targets
it might not be able to keep.
'What we are about is not remaining a party of opposition but moving to be a
party of government,' he said.
Mr Prescott, whose support is mainly on the party's traditional socialist
wing, said a Labour government would have to set targets to retain
credibility with the electorate.
He said: 'I believe we will have to set ourselves a target . . . because I
don't think the people in this country are going to be satisfied with
rhetoric. Let the politicians be judged on how many people they get back to
work.'
Mr Prescott, who called for a 'crusade' to put unemployment at the top of
the political agenda, declined to define full employment or indicate what
targets a Labour government should set.
But he said big cuts in unemployment could be financed by raising taxes on
the better off, making joint venture infrastructure projects easier, and
allowing local councils to spend Pounds 6bn of accumulated capital receipts.
Mr Prescott also injected a note of controversy by combining his blunt
rejection of Mr Blair's cautious approach to full employment with an attack
on Labour's 'tendency to avoid difficult questions' in favour of 'easy
answers' and 'warm language'.
Mr Livingstone, the MP for Brent East, said he was prepared to stand as the
candidate of the leftwing Campaign group of MPs. Mr Jeremy Corbyn, MP for
Islington North, will seek election as deputy leader.
Mr Livingstone, who unsuccessfully sought nominations for the leadership in
1992, said he planned to write to Labour MPs today 'saying the views of the
left are views that should be heard in this election'.

FT  13 JUN 94 / Tory MPs call for cuts in spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rightwing Tory MPs are calling on the prime minister to carry out sweeping
reductions in public expenditure next year, saying that this is the only
means by which the government can cut taxes and regain popularity before the
next general election.
As the Conservative party comes to terms with poor results in the European
elections, Tory rightwingers are pressing the prime minister to cut public
expenditure at once and set a strategy leading to tax reductions over the
next two or three years.
In 10 days' time the cabinet will hold its first discussion on this year's
public spending round. The meeting will discuss in broad terms where
departmental budgets could be cut, setting the tone for discussions on the
issue right up to this winter's Budget.
The Treasury has already said that last year's Budget saw significant cuts
in expenditure, lopping about Pounds 15bn off spending over the three years
to 1996. But some Tory backbenchers said yesterday the government must go a
good deal further than this if it is to regain its tax-cutting credentials
before the next election.
Yesterday Mr John Townend, one of the most prominent Tory rightwingers,
called on the prime minister to carry out drastic reductions in the number
of people working in the civil service. He said: 'He has to cut the head
count in the public sector.'
Sir Norman Fowler, the Tory party chairman, also signalled that, in the wake
of the Euro-election defeat, tax cuts were now the key to Tory recovery. He
said: 'I think over the next two or three years the opportunity of the
chancellor of the Exchequer is much greater in terms of tax reductions.'
Many rightwing Tories were yesterday also calling on Mr Major to carry out
an extensive cabinet reshuffle, dropping Mr Douglas Hurd as foreign
secretary and consolidating the more sceptical line on Europe that the prime
minister has taken in recent weeks.

Delegates at the GMB general union conference yesterday passed an emergency

The vote was a blow to the TUC policy under Mr John Monks, general

FT  13 JUN 94 / GMB to state choice of Labour leader
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The GMB general union, the second-largest affiliated union to the Labour
party, is likely this week to endorse one of the party leadership
candidates.
The three leading candidates are to speak today at the union's conference in
Blackpool. Mrs Margaret Beckett, acting leader, will address the conference,
and Mr Tony Blair and Mr John Prescott will speak at a rally for delegates.
Mr John Edmonds, general secretary, said that the union's choice would be
decided in time to meet the party's deadline of midnight on Thursday.
The GMB has 836,000 members of whom 749,000 pay the political levy and thus
can vote in the party leadership ballot.
Papers sent to members in the union's postal ballot - conducted by the
Electoral Reform Society - will be accompanied by a separate document
stating the GMB's choice for leader.
The union's ballot papers will be distributed by post on June 27 and the
ballot will close on July 18.
Mr Edmonds said creating full employment should be the issue that decided
Labour's leadership election.
'Jobs and how to create them is the common platform of a candidate for
Labour's leader, making full employment the vision of the next Labour
government', he said.
Mr Edmonds at a press conference issued evidence from a MORI poll for the
union that found 66 per cent of voters who had switched their party
allegiance since the 1992 general election said policies on creating jobs
and reducing unemployment were important in them making this decision.
He added the poll had also found that two-thirds of respondents backed a
national minimum wage and 57 per cent wanted Britain to sign the social
chapter of the European Union's Maastricht treaty.
Mr Edmonds also said that the cause of full employment rated more highly
with the voters than health, education, or taxation.

FT  13 JUN 94 / Benefit rules 'hit job take-up'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The rules and administration of the social security system discourage
unemployed people from taking up part-time, casual and low-paid jobs, a
study from the Commission on Social Justice says today.
The commission, set up by the Labour party to review the welfare state,
attacks claims that over-generous benefits discourage the unemployed from
taking jobs. It says that it is the inflexibility of the benefit system
which 'locks' thousands of people out of an increasingly flexible labour
market.
Unemployed people who accept a low-paid job lose income support and must
wait several weeks before they can receive family credit, the means-tested
benefit for low-income families. The risk that the benefit might be refused
or withdrawn creates insecurity about re-entering the labour market.
The study also says that the partners of unemployed and low-paid men are
discouraged from seeking work by the rules for paying benefits. The extra
earnings of the wife reduce the amount of benefits the husband receives and
can leave the family worse off after paying for travel to work and any
childcare costs.
As a result, the majority of wives of unemployed men do not work and
unemployed men try to find jobs that pay enough to keep the whole family,
since they cannot afford to accept lower-paid jobs.
The study says that most unemployed people want work, but are looking for an
income that will meet their household needs.
The study offers a series of policy options to encourage people to take any
form of paid work by ensuring that this leads to higher incomes.
These include extending housing benefit to low-paid people with mortgages
and changes to the benefit rules to encourage wives to go out to work.

Delegates at the GMB general union conference yesterday passed an emergency

The vote was a blow to the TUC policy under Mr John Monks, general

Mr John Edmonds, GMB general secretary, said: 'There is a feeling in our

'Delegates have made a tactical decision. Why should we offer resuscitation

Mr David Hunt, employment secretary, is expected to address a TUC full
employment conference in July. Mr Steven Dorrell, financial secretary to the
Treasury, spoke three months ago to a TUC public services conference.
The GMB's decision follows last Thursday's move by the TGWU general union to
boycott the TUC's employment conference in July in pro-test at Mr Hunt's
presence as well as that of Mr Howard Davis, the director-general of
Confederation of British Industry.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China yesterday made its strongest plea yet for renewed diplomatic efforts
to resolve the argument over North Korea's reluctance to open its nuclear
sites to inspection. Mr Qian Qichen, China's foreign minister, reflecting
Beijing's growing alarm on the possibility of United Nations sanctions on
Pyongyang, urged the international community to refrain from 'closing the
door'.
Sanctions, Mr Qian told the visiting Japanese foreign minister, Mr Koji
Kakizawa, could only intensify the 'contradictions' and even lead to results
that all parties would not like to see.
However, in Seoul, the US, Japan and South Korea, after holding discussions
in the South Korean capital at the weekend, reaffirmed their determination
to push for the phased introduction of UN sanctions against North Korea
unless Pyongyang accepts international nuclear inspections.
Russia also indicated its willingness to support sanctions after the US
endorsed a Moscow-sponsored international conference that would attempt to
resolve the North Korean nuclear issue.
Invited participants to the conference would include North and South Korea,
the US, Russia, Japan, China, the UN and the International Atomic Energy
Agency, the UN's nuclear watchdog.
Mr Qian's statement reflected Beijing's fears that a sanctions process
backed by the US and its western allies might develop a life of its own and
lead eventually to a dangerous confrontation with North Korea.
'We appeal to the parties concerned to make efforts to open dialogue and
seek a way of settling the problem step by step,' said Mr Qian.
Beijing is now at the centre of intense international efforts to defuse the
Korean crisis, recently receiving foreign ministers of both South Korea and
Japan as well as the chief of staff of the North Korean armed forces.
Mr Qian appeared to foreclose the possibility of early Chinese support of
sanctions. The US and its allies may proceed as early as this week before
the UN Security Council to put forward a resolution calling for phased
sanctions.
The IAEA has warned that the opportunity may have passed to verify whether
North Korea has diverted weapons-grade plutonium from spent fuel rods at a
reactor near Pyongyang.
On Friday, the IAEA voted to suspend technical assistance to North Korea in
protest at its refusal to open its nuclear sites to inspection. China's IAEA
delegate abstained.
Meanwhile, former US president Jimmy Carter will arrive in Seoul tomorrow on
his way to Pyongyang, where he will meet North Korean president Kim Il-sung
in what is described as a private initiative to maintain dialogue between
North Korea and the US on the nuclear issue.

FT  13 JUN 94 / The worst in Japan is over, survey suggests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A faint economic dawn is beginning to dispel Japan's longest recession in
post-war years, yet the rising sun looks anaemic.
The latest survey of business confidence ('Tankan') by the Bank of Japan
last Friday, showing the first upturn in sentiment for five years, was the
latest in a series of indicators that not only is the worst over but an
upturn has tentatively begun.
The publication this week of gross domestic product figures for the first
quarter to March is expected to confirm this. Several forecasters expect a
small rise from the previous three months, perhaps a fraction of a
percentage point, with a decline of a similar order from the same period
last year.
Few in Tokyo now doubt that the recession is past or at least near the
bottom. The main evidence includes a rise in industrial production from the
final quarter of last year to the first three months of this, plus increases
in imports, household spending, construction contracts and an acceleration
in the rate of growth in housing starts over the same period.
At the same time, the rate of decline has slowed in supermarket and
department store sales, car registrations and machinery orders.
The big question now is in what kind of shape Japan's economy will emerge
from the recession. Is it really anaemic, or leaner and meaner than in the
fast-growth late 1980s?
In the short term, at least, the latest economic statistics suggest a weaker
recovery than from the previous two downturns, in the early and mid-1980s.
For one thing, the Tankan shows that Japan's corporate restructuring, so far
gentle by US and European standards, still has some way to go - not a
problem in the previous upturns.
The gap between output and demand is still high, though declining. This is
shown in the Tankan by a decline in the percentage balance between companies
reporting excess and insufficient supply from 55 in the previous survey in
February to 50 in May.
One consequence is that companies, in particular those in manufacturing,
plan to cut their workforces by about 1 per cent, a further drag on consumer
spending. Another is that they plan to reduce capital investment - by 3.7
per cent, for the third year running - so hitting suppliers of capital
equipment.
The general tone of the Tankan was, however, strong enough to give the Bank
of Japan an argument not to cut its 1.75 per cent official discount rate
(ODR), at which it supplies funds to commercial banks. The BoJ has guided
overnight market rates - at which commercial banks lend to one another - to
a record low of just over 2 per cent, very close to the ODR. Another drop is
seen by many as a vitally-needed step to stimulate the fragile recovery.
Yet central bank officials have talked in recent weeks of controlling the
risks of recovery, rather than easing credit further, a sign that the lesson
of the late 1980s' liquidity-fuelled explosion in asset prices is still
etched deep in their minds.
All this is worrying for those who fear that tight credit could throttle the
recovery. For despite the central bank's strategy of driving down overnight
rates, bank lending remains weak. There was a 1 per cent annualised decline
in new loans by the 11 city banks last month, the Federation of Bankers'
Associations says.
All this indicates that the after-effects of the recession might take a year
or two to evaporate. Many economists in Tokyo assume that Japan has lost one
or two points from the average 4.5 per cent GDP growth rate it experienced
in the 1980s.
Of course, they could be too pessimistic, an over-reaction to the false
economic dawn that appeared in spring last year. Corporate Japan could yet
surprise the world with its hidden strength, as it has done before.
The latest forecasts of Japanese companies' pre-tax profits by four Tokyo
economic research groups range widely, from a 2.7 per cent decline by Nomura
Research Institute to a 7.4 per cent increase by Nikko Research Centre. But
the four, who published their forecasts late on Friday, expect corporate
Japan to show profits growth of between 20 per cent and 25 per cent the
following year.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
China will crack down on black-market gold trading from the end of this
month, in an effort to re-establish the state monopoly over the buying and
selling of the precious metal.
The authorities also said at the weekend that futures trading in gold would
be banned.
The People's Bank, China's central bank, which is responsible for gold
acquisition, reported that in the first four months of this year gold
purchases were down by 35 per cent on the same period in 1992. China's
central bank purchases of gold last year plummeted 32 per cent from 1992.
This followed growth of a rampant black market.
A circular issued by the State Council, China's cabinet, said officials who
allowed a black market in gold to continue after July 1 would be 'charged
and punished'. Mines that failed to sell their gold output to the state
would be denied government loans and tax breaks.
The circular also urged the People's Bank to increase the gold price to
international levels. China last September doubled the gold acquisition
price to Yn2,986 (Pounds 229) a troy ounce, about 10 per cent below the
world market. China produced 100 tonnes of gold last year and imported 150
tonnes. Most of this was used to make jewellery. China is the fourth biggest
gold consumer after India, the US and Saudi Arabia.
Reuter adds from Beijing: China, blaming blind speculation on international
futures exchanges for big foreign exchange losses, said it would allow
Chinese brokerages to place orders only on domestic exchanges. 'The state
will strictly control futures trading outside the borders,' the official
People's Daily said.

Delicate relations between Beijing and Taipei reached their lowest ebb after
the attack, but bilateral relations appeared to improve after China arrested
the three men in April.
Taiwan plans to hold a new round of high-level talks with the mainland
Chinese government in Taipei in August, according to a Taiwanese newspaper.
The Straits Exchange Foundation plans to invite Mr Tang Shubei,
secretary-general of China's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Strait, to travel to Taipei in August for talks on how to expand contacts
between the two bodies, the China Times reported.

Mr Askar Akayev, the reformist president of the poor and remote republic of
Kyrgyzstan, was quoted at the weekend as saying that his country was doomed
by its backwardness to return to Russia's economic orbit, Leyla Boulton
reports. According to the Russian Information Agency, President Akayev, in a
surprisingly frank description of his nation's prospects, said its industry
could not attract 'serious' foreign investment and would remain 'on the
sidelines of economic progress' for at least 10 to 15 years.

Mr Yegor Gaidar, former deputy prime minister and engineer of Russia's

which he promised would be the most disciplined of liberal parties to
compete in elections scheduled for 1996, Leyla Boulton writes from Moscow.
The party is being built on the rump of last December's ill-fated electoral
alliance known as Russia's Choice, which united a variety of anti-Communist
parties and movements but did badly in the elections despite support from
the state-owned media. Mr Gaidar said the party, which would guarantee
market reforms, would have to be disciplined 'otherwise our struggle with
conservative forces will recall a battle between cavalry and an armoured
division'.

New York's city council has approved a plan to bring back the trams or

Tomkins writes from New York. A vote in the council at the end of last week
will allow officials to seek bidders for a Dollars 135m (Pounds 90m) project
to build a 2.2m tramway running the length of 42nd Street from one side of
Manhattan to the other.
The project is intended to cut traffic, pollution and noise, speed up travel
across midtown Manhattan and help bring about the regeneration of 42nd
Street. Years ago the street was famous for its night-life, but much of it
is now rundown and sleazy.

FT  13 JUN 94 / Fall in world CFC output a 'green' victory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Global production of chlorofluorocarbon gases, which scientists say are
responsible for holes in the earth's ozone layer, has plummeted since 1988,
according to a US report.
The fall is the most striking success to date of the worldwide campaign by
environmentalists against the use of CFCs.
The report, Vital Signs 1994, by the Washington-based Worldwatch Institute,
a private think-tank, says CFC production fell 20 per cent last year, and is
60 per cent down from its peak in 1988.
Mr Lester Brown, head of the institute, said: 'We are now headed in the
right direction. If we continue on this phase-out path, eventually the ozone
layer will heal. But that is several decades down the road.'
Concern about the ozone layer dates back to 1974 when two atmospheric
scientists at the University of California warned that CFCs could deplete
the ozone layer which protects the earth from ultraviolet radiation.
Governments began to take the threat seriously when a team led by Mr Joseph
Farman of the British Antarctic Survey reported a recurring hole in the
ozone layer over Antarctica.
Subsequent investigations found a thinning of the ozone in other regions of
the world. In 1987, governments signed the Montreal Protocol, promising to
halve CFC production over the next decade. Later agreements in London in
1990 and Copenhagen in 1992 pledged many industrial countries to phase out
production of CFCs and other ozone-depleting substances. CFC production is
due to stop in industrialised countries by the end of this year.
Vital Signs, an annual exercise in 'taking the planet's pulse', found the
environmental movement making important gains. Use of wind power rose 13 per
cent last year, with most of the growth in northern Europe. Nuclear
generating capacity grew by nearly 3 per cent, but the number of plants
under construction fell and closures increased. Capacity is expected to peak
before the year 2000.
Natural-gas production expanded to record levels and now provides 21 per
cent of the world's primary energy as coal use declined. Sales of compact
fluorescent lamps - efficient substitutes for incandescent bulbs - have
quadrupled over the last five years.
Carbon emissions - believed to produce global warming - fell slightly, but
that was attributed to recession in the industrialised countries and the
economic contraction in the former Soviet Union. Emissions are soaring in
Asia.
As is usual, there is bad news aplenty. The 1993 grain harvest dropped by
nearly 5 per cent, the report says, one of the largest declines on record.
Some 70 per cent of the world's 6,600 bird species are declining; 1,000 are
in danger of extinction.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk is expected to sign a 'partnership'
agreement with the European Union in Luxembourg tomorrow , the first sign of
a more even-handed EU strategy toward Ukraine and neighbouring Russia.
Mr Kravchuk will draw satisfaction from the fact that a similar partnership
agreement between the EU and Russia remains unfinished, though Brussels
hopes to wrap up the accord in time for the European summit in Corfu next
week.
Ukraine's collapsing economy and nuclear arsenal make it the regional danger
spot, but the EU's new policy of engagement is being hobbled by a row over a
European Commission plan to send emergency food aid.
Britain, among others, opposes the provision of farm credit guarantees
amounting to Ecu100m (Pounds 77m) so Kiev can buy western fertilisers with
scarce hard currency. The UK believes that reports of food shortages are
exaggerated, and that the Commission's move is a short-term palliative.
Winter crops in Ukraine failed and had to be replanted. Many spring crops
were planted without fertilisers, making them vulnerable. Kiev's powerful
agricultural lobby, trying to restore traditionally high subsidies, has
warned of pending disaster, but western diplomats believe large-scale
humanitarian aid is 'premature'.
Though choice is limited, food stores are stocked. Many warehouses are
watching their potatoes rot because demand has dropped on the retail market.
The explanation is that self-sufficient Ukrainians with access to garden
plots have been planting their own.
'Ukraine doesn't need food,' said one diplomat. 'They need much more
sophisticated help' - such as market incentives to produce, a competitive
distribution system and better storage facilities.
Nuclear safety in Ukraine will feature high on the agenda of the Group of
Seven industrialised nations in Naples next month. Brussels estimates
suggest that the dismantling of the Chernobyl plant could cost Ecu300m-500m.
Ukraine is trying to make a goldmine out of the international outcry to
close Chernobyl, raising its asking price to shut the station down from
Dollars 2bn to Dollars 14bn. With Ukraine's future government still up in
the air, it will be tricky to secure a deal with the executive branch
without the danger of it back-firing in Ukraine's parliament.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Haiti's army-backed government has declared a state of emergency after the
tightening of economic sanctions against the Caribbean nation and amid
intensified rumours of impending foreign military intervention to remove the
military and reinstate Mr Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the exiled president.
The announcement of the emergency by Mr Emile Jonassaint, recently appointed
head of the government by the army, coincided with an attempt by several
thousand Haitians and hundreds of foreigners to leave the country before the
termination of commercial flights, one of several new sanctions against
Haiti, takes effect.
The US and Canada say they will end commercial flights to Haiti on June 25
to increase pressure on the military rulers who took power in a coup 30
months ago. France is also expected to end commercial flights, but it is not
yet known whether other countries which have air links to Haiti, including
the Netherlands, Panama and the Dominican Republic, will do the same.
In a further show of defiance, the Haitian military said it would close the
country's main airport in Port au Prince, the capital, and several smaller
airfields, five days before the new sanctions takes effect.
Foreigners have been told by their governments to leave Haiti quickly, and
several governments are also evacuating family members of their diplomatic
staff. Most of the Haitians who have been purchasing tickets to leave the
country are children and women who are being sent abroad as the tighter
sanctions take effect.
Concerns about public safety increased over the weekend after the military
seized guns from several US marines entering the country. US officials said
the marines were assigned to duties at the US embassy in Port au Prince, as
part of a normal rotation of guards.
The imposition of a state of emergency will not change the situation in the
country. The military and its police arm have been exercising powers in a
virtual state of siege since economic sanctions were put into effect soon
after the coup.
Diplomats in Port au Prince said yesterday the declaration of the emergency,
and decision to close airports before the June 25 deadline, were part of the
military government's display of defiance of efforts to have Mr Aristide
returned.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin has issued a long-awaited decree banning
dishonest advertising, which has enabled crooked financiers to make fortunes
at the expense of gullible investors.
The Russian Information Agency said a decree at the weekend, aimed primarily
at extravagant promises made in TV and newspaper advertisements, prohibits
companies from promising specific levels of future dividend payments or
guarantees of the future performance of a given investment. Some observers
believe that after seven decades of communist propaganda TV viewers in
Russia's newly-developing market economy have proven vulnerable to
perceiving advertising as fact.
One investment fund which promised to turn citizens' privatisation vouchers
into 'gold' was recently found to have defrauded investors of millions of
dollars. Another suggested to investors they might make enough on a
Rbs10,000 (Pounds 3.30) privatisation voucher to buy a house in Paris. Many
small banks have attracted small savers with promises of astronomically high
interest rates. But authorities say they have been powerless to stop
television stations and newspapers from carrying advertising even months
after it has been officially denounced as fraudulent.
From now on, businesses can only advertise actual dividend and interest
rates they have paid in the past. The decree, to be enforced by Russia's
anti-monopoly committee, obliges advertisers to withdraw within three days
any advertising found to violate the decree.

FT  13 JUN 94 / Investors need not fear instability, says Bhutto / Interview
with Pakistan's prime minister
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL and FARHAN BOKHARI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ms Benazir Bhutto, Pakistan's prime minister, said yesterday the country was
now free of the political instability that had plagued it in the last five
years and urged foreign companies to invest.
'Pakistan today has real democracy and real stability,' Ms Bhutto said in an
interview yesterday. 'People have begun to realise that Pakistan has
returned to full democracy.'
She dismissed suggestions that the military, which ruled Pakistan until the
death of the dictator General Zia ul-Haq in 1988, was still active in
politics. She said the army leadership was now 'neutral', siding neither
with Ms Bhutto nor with Mr Nawaz Sharif, the main opposition leader and
former prime minister. Mr Sharif's government collapsed last year amid
arguments with the army and with the president. Months of political turmoil
culminated in a general election and Ms Bhutto's return to power.
Speaking a few days after the government announced its budget last Thursday
for the year starting in July, Ms Bhutto said she was trying to make
Pakistan an 'investor-friendly country'.
Building on the steps taken by Mr Sharif and his temporary successor Mr
Moeen Qureshi to liberalise the economy, the budget includes cuts in import
duties and the introduction of full convertibility of the rupee on the
current account. The government also plans to keep a tight rein on borrowing
 -after cutting the fiscal deficit from 8 per cent of GDP at the end of Mr
Sharif's rule to 5.4 per cent now, ministers intend further cuts to 4 per
cent in 1994-95.
Ms Bhutto said foreign investment could play a leading role in Pakistan.
'Some Pakistanis are very sceptical about foreign investment in Pakistan but
I think it is because they are not aware that the world has changed so
dramatically, and in the 21st century we are going to be witnessing a global
economy. We have to try to prepare Pakistan to compete with that global
economy and integrate with that global economy.'
Ms Bhutto said she was very encouraged by the response from foreign
companies. Last week, ICI Pakistan, the 61 per cent-owned affiliate of ICI,
the British chemical group, announced plans for a Dollars 350m (Pounds 233m)
plant to produce pure terephthalic acid, a raw material for making synthetic
fibres. The plant, to be funded by a rights issue and loans, will be one of
Pakistan's largest industrial investments.
Also, international bankers and fund managers are close to giving final
approval to a Dollars 2bn oil-fired power station to be built on the Hub
river, which is being financed by a combination of public and private
finance. Officials said yesterday the scheme's promoters, including the
World Bank, hopes to secure financial commitments by the end of July or
early August at the latest. Equity investors, which are putting up Dollars
320m, include National Power, the British generating company, which last
week agreed to raise its stake from Dollars 40m to Dollars 90m and assume
management control from a consortium which has run the project until now.
Ms Bhutto said that with the help of the Hub river project and other
schemes, the government planned to increase electricity output by 50 per
cent in five years from about 10,000MW in 1993-94. 'Ridding the country of
power cuts is the major concern.'
The government expects the economy to grow by 4 per cent in 1993-94 after
2.9 per cent last year when agriculture suffered from drought and a pest
attack on cotton, a principal export. The government predicts a 1994-95
recovery to 7 per cent. Ms Bhutto said: 'Much depends on weather and crops
but given good weather and good crops I think Pakistan will be in a good
position by next year. So if within 18 months we can bring real economic
stability we would feel proud of that achievement.'

<TEXT>
Argentina's foreign minister, Mr Guido di Tella, has said he would consider
paying the Falkland Islands' 2,000 inhabitants to accept Argentine
sovereignty.
In an interview, Mr Di Tella said: 'We would be willing to pay some kind of
compensation in exchange for Argentine sovereignty, but we do not want them
to be paid to get out of the islands.'
Mr Di Tella did not mention a figure, but implied it could be substantial.
He said former UK government adviser Alan Walters had proposed a similar
solution to the dispute over the islands, which led in 1982 to a 74-day
conflict between the two countries.
Mr Di Tella reiterated President Carlos Menem's claim that the islands would
'revert' to Argentina by the year 2000 through peaceful diplomacy and by
convincing the islanders to accept Argentine rule.
However, Mrs Sharon Halford, a Falklands councillor, said: 'I don't think
this would be viewed very favourably. Money is not everything. If they
bought someone out, where would they go?'
Mr Di Tella denied that payments would be made to encourage people to leave
the Falklands and settle elsewhere. He said, 'We want to be very respectful
of these 2,000 people. They have lived there for a long time and have a
special way of life, and if necessary we are ready to consider monetary
compensation for the psychological disturbance' of ceding sovereignty.

<TEXT>
The Czech Republic's privatisation programme is excepted to be speeded with
the appointment on Friday of Mr Roman Ceska as chairman of the Czech
National Property Fund, the state holding company responsible for
privatisation. Mr Ceska replaces Mr Tomas Jezek, who resigned after charges
that the agency was selling state assets on the cheap.
Mr Ceska said he would put proposals before the board of the NPS this month:
'I want to speed up the privatisation process.'
The official reason for Mr Jezek's resignation was a potential conflict of
interests between his position at the NPF and his imminent chairmanship of a
parliamentary budget committee. But he said he had stepped down because of
'continuous attacks' on him in recent weeks.
Fierce rivalry between the NPF and the Privatisation Ministry has been a
feature of the Czech privatisation process. Politicians have accused the NPF
of acting independently of the government and of reaching agreement with
investors without seeking approval from parliament.
Tension increased after several high-profile sell-offs, including the sale
of a stake in Czechoslovak Airlines to Air France and after a DM3.5bn
(Pounds 1.4m) investment in the car maker Skoda by Volkswagen, Europe's
biggest car maker, turned sour.
Mr Jezek accused the board, headed by Mr Jiri Skalicky, privatisation
minister, of disrupting the NPF's operations and trying to undermine his
position. Mr Skalicky said the board asked Mr Jezek to resign because it was
'dissatisfied with the pace of realisation of privatisation projects'.
The NPF is responsible for selling stakes in state companies to domestic and
foreign investors and is a shareholder in much of Czech industry.

FT  13 JUN 94 / Nigerian presidential poll winner eludes capture

<TEXT>
The Nigerian military, getting tougher on the anniversary of the election it
nullified, offered a reward yesterday for the capture of Mr Moshood Abiola,
a fugitive tycoon who tried to claim his mandate by declaring himself
president, AP reports from Lagos.
General Sani Abacha, The military ruler, marked the annulment of the
presidential election a year ago with a nationwide television address during
which he threatened to punish opponents of his rule.
'. . . Choosing the path of confrontation and subversion at this time of our
national history would not be tolerated. Such acts would be sternly
punished,' Gen Abacha said.
He also promised to return Nigeria to 'genuine democracy', but like previous
military dictators who have ruled Africa's most populous nation, he gave no
timetable for this.
Mr Abiola gained the most votes in the election when the ruler at the time,
Gen Ibrahim Babangida, suddenly voided the ballots, triggering riots that
killed an estimated 200 people over three days.
Gen Babangida resigned last August, naming a civilian supporter in his
stead. Gen Abacha forced his way into power in November and dismantled the
nation's elected Senate, lower house, 30 state governments and more than 500
local legislatures.
He has made it a treasonable offence to criticise his government, and on
Saturday ordered the arrest of Mr Abiola after the businessman declared
himself president.
State media said a reward of 50,000 naira (Pounds 1,515), at the official
rate, was being offered for information leading to the capture of Mr Abiola.
Mr Isiaka Adeleke, former governor of Osun state, who lost office when Gen
Abacha dissolved all civilian political posts, said Mr Abiola was safe at a
secret location in Lagos.
He said Mr Abiola travelled on Saturday evening to a city park for a
ceremony in which he was sworn in as president. Mr Adeleke said between
2,000 and 4,000 people were present at the largely symbolic ceremony.
Gen Abacha yesterday also banned all private aircraft from leaving the
country. Mr Abiola in the past has fled to London aboard his private jet
during the year-long political turmoil in Nigeria.
Police were posted near Mr Abiola's home and office complex in Lagos and
searched the premises yesterday morning, but did not find him.

Rebels in Mexico's southern state of Chiapas rejected the government's peace
offer, saying their local demands were met only partially and that permanent
peace could only be achieved via a nationwide democratic transition, Ted
Bardacke reports from Mexico City. They also pledged to maintain the
ceasefire that has held since mid-January. The peace offer, which emerged
from negotiations in the Chiapas city of San Cristobal de las Casas in
March, was rejected by 97.88 per cent of the rebel forces and their
supporters in voting held over the past month, according to a rebel

FT  13 JUN 94 / EU divided over accord with Ukraine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER and JILL BARSHAY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS, KIEV
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk is expected to sign a 'partnership'
agreement with the European Union in Luxembourg tomorrow , the first sign of
a more even-handed EU strategy toward Ukraine and neighbouring Russia.
Mr Kravchuk will draw satisfaction from the fact that a similar partnership
agreement between the EU and Russia remains unfinished, though Brussels
hopes to wrap up the accord in time for the European summit in Corfu next
week.
Ukraine's collapsing economy and nuclear arsenal make it the regional danger
spot, but the EU's new policy of engagement is being hobbled by a row over a
European Commission plan to send emergency food aid.
Britain, among others, opposes the provision of farm credit guarantees
amounting to Ecu100m (Pounds 77m) so Kiev can buy western fertilisers with
scarce hard currency. The UK believes that reports of food shortages are
exaggerated, and that the Commission's move is a short-term palliative.
Winter crops in Ukraine failed and had to be replanted. Many spring crops
were planted without fertilisers, making them vulnerable. Kiev's powerful
agricultural lobby, trying to restore traditionally high subsidies, has
warned of pending disaster, but western diplomats believe large-scale
humanitarian aid is 'premature'.
Though choice is limited, food stores are stocked. Many warehouses are
watching their potatoes rot because demand has dropped on the retail market.
The explanation is that self-sufficient Ukrainians with access to garden
plots have been planting their own.
'Ukraine doesn't need food,' said one diplomat. 'They need much more
sophisticated help' - such as market incentives to produce, a competitive
distribution system and better storage facilities.
Mr Kravchuk, fighting a tough campaign for re-election this month, can
expect a warm reception in Luxembourg. But privately he will be warned that
future aid is linked to closing unsafe nuclear reactors such as Chernobyl,
and ratification of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
Nuclear safety in Ukraine will feature high on the agenda of the Group of
Seven industrialised nations in Naples next month. Brussels estimates
suggest that the dismantling of the Chernobyl plant could cost Ecu300m-500m.
Ukraine is trying to make a goldmine out of the international outcry to
close Chernobyl, raising its asking price to shut the station down from
Dollars 2bn to Dollars 14bn. With Ukraine's future government still up in
the air, it will be tricky to secure a deal with the executive branch
without the danger of it back-firing in Ukraine's parliament.
A second complication is that the EU's pressure for accelerating closure of
Chernobyl is tempered by the desire to avoid being stuck with the whole
clean-up bill.

FT  13 JUN 94 / Delors jobs plan wins backing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Plans to promote flexibility in European labour markets which fall well
short of UK-style deregulation are spelt out in a European Commission
progress report on last December's white paper on employment and
competitiveness by Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, writes David
Goodhart, Labour Editor.
The report was warmly welcomed at a meeting of the Commission last week and
will form the basis of Mr Delors' contribution to the European Council
meeting in Corfu this month.
The report, written by the employment task force at the Commission's
directorate general for social affairs, says the white paper has been judged
useful in all member states but 'a fragmentary approach is still noticeable'
and the need for 'collective action' has not yet been realised.
It also argues the white paper strategy is a medium-term one and that
progress at this stage must be judged in terms of 'trends and changes in
political positions'.
The paper is vague on the appropriate role for Brussels in promoting the
goals of the white paper. Reflecting the more cautious approach to
European-level employment legislation spelt out recently by Mr Padraig
Flynn, the social affairs commissioner, the report says Brussels should
encourage countries to 'pick and mix' elements of policy from different
national systems.
The paper welcomes progress made on the white paper recommendation to reduce
non-wage labour costs and approves of the steps being taken in countries
such as Spain to liberalise redundancy and dismissal legislation.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Two by-elections and 80 local council elections in Ireland held the same day
as the European election last Thursday have badly shaken the coalition
government.
Fianna Fail, the senior coalition partner, has lost the two seats it was
defending in the Dail (Irish parliament). One of them - a marginal seat in
Dublin - has gone to the Democratic Left party.
Of much greater concern for Fianna Fail, however, is the loss of what was
believed to be a secure seat in the west of Ireland formerly held by Mr
Padraig Flynn, Ireland's member of the European Commission, which was being
defended by his daughter, Ms Beverly Cooper Flynn. The seat went to the
conservative opposition candidate, Mr Michael Ring of Fine Gael.
In the local elections, the Labour party, the junior coalition partner, has
seen its vote slump to 11 per cent from the 19.5 per cent it obtained in the
1992 general election.

FT  13 JUN 94 / W Europe new car sales up 13% in May
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
West European new car sales rose by 13.4 per cent to an estimated 1.099m
last month, the biggest monthly increase this year and the strongest
indication to date that demand is recovering from last year's deep
recession.
Sales have been higher than a year ago in four of the last five months, and
in May alone demand rose year-on-year in 16 of 17 markets in west Europe. In
the first five months of 1994 new car demand was higher than a year ago in
11 of the 17 markets.
According to industry estimates, new car sales in the first five months have
risen by 5.5 per cent to 5.4m from 5.14m in the corresponding period a year
ago.
Sales in the whole of 1993 fell by 15.2 per cent to 11.45m, the steepest
decline since the war.
The recovery during the first five months has been led by the UK, France and
Spain and by sharply rising sales in several smaller markets including the
Netherlands, Scandinavia and Ireland.
Sales were still lower than a year ago in Germany, Italy, Austria,
Switzerland, Greece and Portugal, but with the exception of Austria sales
also began to recover in these markets in May.
In Germany, the biggest single market in Europe, new car sales are estimated
to have risen in May by 6.5 per cent year-on-year to 300,000, while new car
sales in Italy increased by 7.5 per cent to 179,000.
New car sales in France and Spain, where demand has been stimulated by
government financial incentives to encourage the scrapping of cars 10 or
more years old, rose sharply year-on-year in May by 26.2 and 31.6 per cent
respectively.
The rate of growth in the UK, which slowed in April under the impact of tax
increases, recovered in May with a rise year-on-year of 10 per cent.
Japanese carmakers, struggling to maintain competitive prices under the
impact of the strong appreciation of the yen, have failed so far to take
part in the recovery and have suffered an estimated 6.5 per cent decline in
sales during the first five months to 596,000.
The share taken by Japanese car producers has fallen to 11 per cent from
12.4 per cent in the same period a year ago.
Only Honda among eight Japanese carmakers in the west European market has
managed to increase its sales this year, and the producers hardest hit are
those without mainstream car production in west Europe, such as Mazda,
Mitsubishi and Daihatsu. Suzuki's four-wheel-drive vehicle plant in Spain
has been closed for much of this year by industrial conflict.
Among the big six volume carmakers in west Europe, the Volkswagen and Fiat
groups have continued to lose ground. The German group's leading brands,
Volkswagen and Audi, have seen sales volume fall this year, offset by sharp
rises at Seat and Skoda, its Spanish and Czech subsidiaries.
The Fiat group, which has been hit in particular by the recession in the
Italian market, is being undermined by the weakness of its Lancia and Alfa
Romeo brands, where sales have declined by 6 and 12 per cent respectively.

FT  13 JUN 94 / German Economy: Bundesbank warns over falling demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Falling private demand poses the biggest threat to Germany's economic
recovery, according to a senior Bundesbank official.
Arguing that no fresh stimulus could be expected from lower interest rates,
Mr Otmar Issing warned the government against any further tax increases.
Mr Issing, the German central bank's chief economist and a member of its
directorate, said state burdens on private incomes were already at record
levels.
'No economy has ever delivered the growth rates we need with such high
contribution rates,' he added in a weekend newspaper interview.
Disposable incomes had fallen in real terms this year, and the prospects for
next were not exactly rosy, he added.
Mr Issing was referring to a 7.5 per cent income tax surcharge to be imposed
next January.
The main purpose of this levy is to finance continuing heavy transfers to
aid economic reconstruction in eastern Germany.
The interview also reflected the bank's concern that recent signs of
recovery might encourage inflationary expectations in the 1994 pay round
starting this autumn.
This year's real wage cuts were insufficient to solve the problems piled up
during the unification boom, he said.
The popular mood was lifted last week by west German growth figures for the
first quarter which showed gross domestic product expanding at more than 2
per cent year on year.
Although exports are continuing to grow strongly, the early surge in private
consumption which contributed to the good first-quarter result is already
showing signs of evaporating.
Mr Issing also confirmed that the bank felt its interest rate policy had
been relaxed as far as possible for the time being.
'We are of the opinion that we have now reached a level . . . appropriate to
the current economic situation and our outstanding problems,' he said.
Despite ballooning monetary growth, the bank continued its rates reduction
policy up to the middle of last month. Since then, Bundesbankers have made
plain that a pause is necessary.
'We must keep our nerve and trust, in spite of all the undeniable
difficulties, that we are on the right course,' Mr. Issing said.
Steering monetary policy would be even more difficult if government failed
to continue reining in state spending.
In the meantime, the excess liquidity bloating the country's M3 measure of
money supply had to be released - 'but not through inflationary spending,
rather in long-term investments.'

FT  13 JUN 94 / Socialist redoubles efforts on behalf of free market: Paul
Betts talks to competition commissioner Karel Van Miert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The fiasco over the European Commission's rescue plan for the steel industry
has left Mr Karel Van Miert, the normally genial European competition
commissioner, in an angry and combative mood. It also seems to have stirred
the Flemish socialist to pursue even more vigorously than his free-market
conservative predecessor, Sir Leon Brittan, competition abuses in the single
market.
Mr Van Miert feels he has been let down by governments which had originally
asked him to draw up with Mr Martin Bangemann, the industry commissioner, a
plan to cut European steel capacity. 'I was asked to put together a steel
plan but I was never 'demandeur' (originator). If the feeling is that we
should put an end to it, I'm prepared to do so,' he said defiantly in an
interview with the Financial Times.
Although governments are now scrambling to salvage the plan, Mr Van Miert
suggested the moves were unlikely to succeed but designed rather to give the
whole affair 'a decent burial'.
For Mr Van Miert, the steel affair reflects the contradictory and often
hypocritical position of governments that ultimately undermines the entire
European Union process. 'It's very frustrating when you have to discuss with
governments about capacity cuts, about state aid, when they all have a veto.
It doesn't work. I mean, it's like a referee in a football game where he has
to ask the player if he please may give him a yellow or a red card. That's
the position the Commission has been facing on steel,' he said.
And then governments, not least the UK, adopt completely contradictory
positions. 'We will be told we are well paid, which is true, perhaps even
over-paid Eurocrats, and not politically responsible, and things like that.
But the British government will ask Mr Bangemann and me officially and
formally to use Article 90 to liberalise the telecommunications sector
without parliament, without the Council of Ministers. Isn't that a very
strange attitude?' he asks, referring to Article 90 of the Treaty of Rome,
known as the nuclear option, a rarely used provision which gives the
Commission the power to break up public monopolies on competition grounds.
In some more liberal quarters, Mr Van Miert's appointment 18 months ago
raised fears he would take a soft approach to competition issues. Instead he
is confounding his doubters by initiating a broad series of competition
cases involving everything from mergers and state aid to price fixing in
sectors as varied as consumer goods, cement production, carton board,
telecommunications and banking.
He is proposing to block a controversial takeover of a German feminine
hygiene products company by Procter &amp; Gamble of the US: only the second deal
to be blocked by the Commission since it was given wider powers to vet large
mergers more than two years ago.
Mr Van Miert, a former transport commissioner who engineered European air
transport liberalisation, is also planning to attack ground handling
monopolies at European airports. He is keeping an eye on the French
government's proposed FFr20bn (Pounds 2.3bn) capital injection into Air
France, the troubled French national carrier, and is pursuing a complaint by
the small Irish carrier, Ryanair, against Aer Lingus, the Irish state flag
carrier, of predatory pricing.
Mr Van Miert is extremely concerned by the French government's plan to
inject FFr4.9bn of capital into Credit Lyonnais, one of Europe's biggest
banks, and writing off FFr40bn of bad debts. In a novel approach to EU
competition investigations, he is planning to appoint a panel of eminent
independent bankers to advise him on the case.
From the beginning, Mr Van Miert has adopted a pragmatic approach to
competition issues. Just as he felt that the only way forward for the steel
industry was a flexible plan linking state aid to the decommissioning of
capacity, even though this might have been in a strict legal sense
questionable, he believes the state has a role to play in areas, including
big infrastructure programmes, where private investors do not want to
invest.
But he is also convinced that the cause of liberalisation in Europe has been
won, even in his own country of Belgium. Under the Commission's state aid
policy for flag carriers, state-owned airlines have been allowed one last
injection of state funds to help them adapt to the new liberalised aviation
market and restructure their operations.
'Sabena (the Belgian national carrier) made losses for many, many years. Now
they have had to adapt in a dramatic way to new circumstances. So we thought
it was fair enough to give carriers a new chance. But just once.'
Privatisation is also the only way ahead for large sectors of previously
state-owned industries, including steel, telecommunications, airlines, among
many others. 'There is no reason why they should be state-owned,' Mr Van
Miert said.
'It is utterly unfair if in a given member state companies not receiving
state aid are being put to the wall by those continuing to produce quite
happily although in trouble because of state support,' he said, adding that
national bankruptcy laws also risked further distorting the market.
For all these reasons, it was important to give the Commission the necessary
instruments to monitor competition. 'If we are not equipped we must admit
that we are unable to do so and then leave it to the gods,' he said. 'Once
you go for liberalisation, you need a strong central authority to make the
rules, implement them and respect them.'
Equally, it was important to take a long-term view of competition and
overall industrial policy, added Mr Van Miert, a close friend of Mr Jacques
Delors, the Commission president. 'I believe you have to remain far-sighted.
One of the great strengths of Jacques Delors is that he senses perhaps much
more than many other people what will or might be needed in years to come. I
believe very much that the next president of the Commission should be that
kind of guy.' Mr Van Miert recalled how Mr Delors asked him to draw up a new
transport infrastructure network for Europe when he first took over the
transport portfolio. 'I still keep the map he gave me on which he drew
various lines and at least one tunnel.'

FT  13 JUN 94 / Scandinavians relieved as Austrians vote Yes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Austria's unequivocal vote to join the European Union brought a big sigh of
relief above all among the leaders of fellow EU applicants Finland, Norway
and Sweden.
All three Nordic governments face deep scepticism or, in the case of Norway,
outright hostility to the proposal to accompany Austria into the union from
January 1 next year.
Signs last week that opposition to membership was mounting in Austria had
raised fears that a No vote would further entrench opposition in the north.
But there was also a hope last night that the wide margin of the Austrian
Yes vote would give a long-awaited lift to Nordic EU supporters, who have
struggled to impart any momentum so far to their campaigns for similar
referendums which are to be held in Finland in October and in Sweden and
Norway in November.
Mr Pertti Salolainen, Finland's foreign trade minister, said the outcome
could help push Finnish voters towards the Yes campaign. 'This piece of news
is very positive and I am very happy about it. . . I'm a believer in the
so-called domino theory.'
Mr Carl Bildt, the Swedish prime minister, said the Austrian result was an
'important signal' for Sweden's referendum.
He said the outcome showed that the argument he had made strongly - that
Sweden must be inside the EU to exert any influence over the future
political and economic development of Europe - was decisive.
He was able to say with genuine conviction that 'country after country' now
sought to participate in European co-operation.
Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland, the Norwegian prime minister facing a No campaign
with well over 50 per cent support in the opinion polls, made much the same
point. She also said Austrian entry to the EU strengthened the opportunity
to build bridges between western and eastern Europe. The Norwegian No
campaign has argued that the EU will shut out poorer former eastern bloc
countries.
The Austrian yes vote comes just before three important party congresses on
the EU issue in Finland, Norway and Sweden next weekend.
In Finland, Mr Esko Aho, prime minister, must overcome deep concern about
the effect of membership on the country's heavily-subsidised farmers when he
seeks the formal backing of his rurally-based Centre party for joining the
EU.
It should also stiffen the ranks of his coalition government in a difficult
parliamentary no-confidence vote due on Wednesday.
The Austrian result will reinforce, too, the leaderships of Mrs Brundtland's
Labour party and the Swedish opposition Social Democratic party as they hold
special conferences to fix party policy on the EU issue. Both are expected
to win party support despite heavy internal opposition.

FT  13 JUN 94 / EU backers shrug off Haider: Opponent's scare campaign fails
in membership referendum battle

Whatever the meaning of other messages that arrived in Brussels yesterday
from around Europe, those coming from Austria were unequivocally positive.
Even the most optimistic pro-European Austrians never dreamed that 66.4 per
cent of voters participating in yesterday's referendum would put their
support behind joining the EU.
An examination of the final days of the referendum campaign suggests that
the vote reflected a solid vote of confidence in the EU as an institution.
A week ago, opinion polls indicated a very close result, and a scare
campaign mounted by the anti-EU camp appeared to be eroding pro-EU
sentiment. But by the end of the week, the tide was running heavily in the
EU's favour. What happened in between was that the anti-EU forces went too
far, and the government was able to undermine their credibility.
On Wednesday, Mr Jorg Haider, the populist right-wing leader, held up a
container of Spanish yoghurt during a television debate, claiming that it
contained a dangerous colouring agent and that Austrians would be obliged to
eat it.
Mr Haider also intensified his complaints about the intensity of the
government's pro-EU campaign, urging resentful voters to use the referendum
to teach it a lesson.
On Friday, Mr Alois Mock, the foreign minister who has campaigned tirelessly
for the EU cause in spite of a severe illness, struck back angrily. 'Anyone
who thinks this vote is about teaching the government a lesson is behaving
on the very edge of what is democratically acceptable,' he said.
Then in a moving nationwide address on Friday night, Mr Thomas Klestil, the
Austrian president, emphasised what he thought the vote was about. The EU,
he said, was an organisation which, for all its faults, had already proved
itself as the best and only hope for preventing war again in western Europe.
At a time when Austria has watched war ravage much of its southern
neighbour, the former Yugoslavia, this message had real meaning. Even in
Tyrol, where the problem of lorry transit traffic has made the EU very
unpopular, a convincing 58.5 per cent voted in favour of joining.
The result should have immediate consequences both inside and outside
Austria.
Mr Wolfgang Wolte, head of EU affairs in the foreign ministry, said
yesterday he was convinced that it would have a positive influence on voters
in Norway, Sweden and Finland. They face EU entry referendums in the autumn.
In Austria itself, the main impact will be on the political scene, possibly
contributing to a realignment among parties after national elections which
are due in October.
Mr Haider appears to be the big loser from the referendum outcome. Heading
into the campaign, his popularity was already at a low ebb following
unimpressive showings in provincial elections, the rejection last year of
his petition to outlaw immigration and defections of leading parliamentary
colleagues.
A sometime supporter of EU membership, he decided halfway through the
campaign to oppose it, initially claiming that the entry terms that the
government had negotiated were unsatisfactory. But he gradually took up any
argument he could find. Austria would be overwhelmed by immigrants,
unemployment would soar and unsafe food would be allowed in the country, he
claimed.
Now he could again face calls for his resignation and further defections
from among his party's parliamentarians.
The ruling socialist-conservative coalition, which presented a unified
pro-EU stand throughout the campaign, emerges with its credibility enhanced.
It came together in 1986 with the main aim of taking Austria into the EU.
Now that goal has been achieved, however, it may well need to redefine
itself.

FT  13 JUN 94 / CDU defies polls in east German vote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's governing Christian Democrats, struggling for
months in the opinion polls, yesterday looked set to defy the pollsters by
doing far better than expected in eastern Germany's local government
elections.
Despite substantial gains by the opposition Social Democrats and the Party
of Democratic Socialism, the successor to the former east German Communist
party, their support appears insufficient to dislodge the CDU from power in
four of the five eastern German states, when state elections are held in
June and October.
Indeed, yesterday's rise in support for the PDS shows voters shifting their
allegiance away from the SPD, as east Germans become sceptical that Mr
Rudolf Scharping, head of the SPD, can offer viable alternative policies to
Mr Kohl's.
In exit polls published last night by the Infas pollsters for ARD
television, the SPD's share of the vote in Saxony-Anhalt, considered a test
case for Mr Kohl's CDU since it will be the first to hold state elections on
June 26, increased from 22.8 per cent in 1990 to 29 per cent, while support
for the PDS rose sharply from 12.7 per cent to 20 per cent.
More surprisingly, support for the CDU fell less than three points to 33 per
cent despite recent corruption scandals, mostly in the Free Democratic
party, the junior partner in the CDU-led coalition in the state.
The FDP'S share of the vote fell from 10 to about 6 per cent. These
provisional results mean the CDU will have to increase its support to hold
on to power.
Even in the northern state of Mecklenberg-Vorpommern, where thousands of
shipyard workers have lost their jobs as a result of closures or
privatisation, the electorate swung behind the chancellor, with support for
the CDU increasing from 27.8 to 33 per cent.
The SPD, for its part, increased its share of the vote from 20 per cent in
1990 to over 27 per cent. But the PDS eroded possible greater gains for the
SPD, as its support rose from 19 per cent to 25 per cent.
In Saxony, CDU remains the largest party, although its support fell from 44
to about 39 per cent. The SPD's share rose from 14 to 22 per cent. Support
for the PDS rose from 11.7 per cent to 16.5 per cent. The FDP slipped below
6 per cent, with its votes shifting to the Greens.
In Thuringia, where a wave of strike by potash miners last year appeared to
to undermine the support for the governing CDU/FDP coalition under Mr
Bernhard Vogel, the CDU's share of the vote only fell from 41.9 to 39 per
cent.
In the western German state of Saarland, which is governed by the SPD, the
CDU made gains, with its provisional vote rising from 35.3 per cent in 1989
to 36.9 per cent.

FT  13 JUN 94 / Unisor to raise Ilva steels bid
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Usinor Sacilor, the French steelmaker, said at the weekend it would table a
new increased bid for 100 per cent of the special steels division of Ilva,
Italy's state-owned steelmaker, Andrew Hill reports from Milan.
The French company also threatened to complain to the European Commission if
Iri, Italy's state holding company, sold the division to a competing
Italo-German consortium, on the grounds of the dominant position that would
be achieved.
The privatisation of Ilva was a central plank of the Commission's steel
plan, aimed at reducing capacity and state subsidies. Ugine, the special
steels subsidiary of Usinor, said it would probably submit its new bid for
an unspecified sum today.
Iri favours the rival bid from a consortium led by Krupp and Thyssen of
Germany, and including Riva and Falck of Italy. Usinor said the Italo-German
bid 'poses problems regarding European competition law'.

FT  13 JUN 94 / Unflappable Kohl sees the tide turn in his favour: Both the
European and local elections have brought welcome news for the chancellor

<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The first big test of Germany's 1994 election marathon yesterday left
Chancellor Helmut Kohl the clear victor, confirming a dramatic reversal of
the trend in public popularity and opinion polls for the past two years.
The combination of European elections nationwide and local elections in
seven of Germany's 16 federal states saw the unflappable chancellor emerge
yet again as the dominant force in German politics. He shrugged off personal
unpopularity in the polls, and last year's drastic slump in the economy, to
prove the forecasters wrong.
The key appears to have been a sharp reversal in public pessimism over the
state of the economy and the nation, with growing confidence that recovery
is well under way. Mr Kohl has caught that turn in mood and exploited it to
the full.
The chancellor's Christian Democratic Union managed to improve its position
in the European poll by around three percentage points and remain the
strongest single party in local elections in east Germany, against virtually
all forecasts there.
The results amount to a resounding endorsement of the chancellor's strategy
of selling himself as the one stable, reliable, internationally trusted and
thoroughly pro-European figure in the German political establishment.
For Mr Rudolf Scharping and the opposition Social Democratic party (SPD),
which has been in front in the polls until the past few weeks, the day
demonstrated a clear failure to make a breakthrough against the ruling CDU,
in spite of rising unemployment and the economic recession.
The uncharismatic Mr Scharping now faces an uphill struggle. And yet the
outcome in October is by no means clear, not least because the liberal Free
Democratic party, the preferred coalition partner for both Mr Kohl and Mr
Scharping, remains desperately weak. If that party cannot recover from
yesterday's debacle, when it failed to gain the minimum 5 per cent support
needed to win seats in the European parliament, the two big parties may yet
be condemned to a grand coalition.
The other joker in the pack is the performance of the Party of Democratic
Socialism (PDS), the former Communist party in eastern Germany, which has
shown that it can still command solid minority support - and will very
probably win its way back into the Bundestag.
The far-right Republicans fared miserably in the polls, seeing a halving in
their support from 1989, in spite of the fact that everyone saw the European
election as a classic opportunity for protest voting.
In stark contrast to the SPD's showing, the day was a big success for the
Greens and their eastern allies, Alliance-90: they look set to win more than
10 per cent in the European poll, in apparent justification of an
unashamedly radical platform of environmental reform and pacifism.
Yesterday's outcome is likely to polarise the political debate far more than
before.
Mr Scharping's strategy has been primarily to prove that his party was
'capable of government'. He admitted last night it had 'lost the first
round. We have failed to persuade the working people of the need for a clear
policy of job creation and social justice.'
Yet the polls last night suggested a crucial failing in SPD policy: since
January, when a majority saw the party as more economically competent than
Mr Kohl's coalition, the tables have been turned. In June, according to a
poll for ZDF television, only 18 per cent still thought so.
Mr Scharping may have failed to get his message across. Many in his party
will now accuse him of having been too desperate to move into the political
centre, stealing the clothes of the CDU.
The real victor, however, is Mr Kohl himself. He has repeatedly rejected the
forecasts of the polls, demonstrating an absolute belief in himself, in the
success of the process of German unification, in the recovery of the German
economy, and in the absence of any realistic alternative to his
conservative-liberal coalition.
He has tirelessly toured from sports hall to beer tent, showing an
inexhaustible enthusiasm for electioneering which his rivals cannot match.
The perception of gathering economic recovery is a crucial factor behind the
revival of his party's fortunes but the secret of his success is what they
call the 'Kanzlerfrage' - the question of the chancellor. He knows he looks
like a chancellor, and Mr Scharping does not. And he is exploiting it quite
mercilessly.

FT  13 JUN 94 / Swiss say No to UN force role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Swiss have once again shown their aversion to foreign involvement, with
57.3 per cent of voters rejecting in a referendum a government proposal that
they provide troops for United Nations peacekeeping operations.
Only 42.7 per cent, or 898,925 people, were in favour - a much lower number
than expected.
Yesterday's vote comes after referendum decisions in 1986 to avoid UN
membership and in 1992 to stay out of the European Economic Area. Earlier
this year, Swiss voters irritated neighbouring European governments by
voting to prohibit transit lorries from their alpine passes from 2004.
The overwhelming rejection of involvement in UN peacekeeping therefore
marked the third time in eight years that the Swiss had turned their backs
on the rest of the world and opted to continue what one television
commentator described as 'splendid isolation'.
There had been signs in the run-up to yesterday's vote that European
countries were no longer willing to accept Switzerland's lack of
international solidarity passively.
Last week, Mr Matthias Wissmann, the German transport minister, acknowledged
that the referendum had no direct relation to European transport
discussions, which have been jolted by the decision in February to ban lorry
transit traffic from the Alps.
The connection was 'more atmospheric', Mr Wissmann said. With a Yes vote,
Switzerland would signal it sought not only to win advantages from
international relations but also to carry the burdens.
The proposal to create a troop of 600 volunteer blue helmet troops was
rejected in all but the French-speaking cantons of Vaud, Neuchatel, Geneva
and Jura, opening the potential for a renewal of tensions between
French-speaking Swiss and the others.
The four-party coalition government and parliament last year agreed to amend
the constitution to allow for the dispatch of peacekeepers.
Opponents claimed that Switzerland's neutrality would be compromised by
participation in peacekeeping and that blue helmet troops were ineffective
and a waste of money. The cost of the peacekeeping contribution was
estimated at SFr100m (Pounds 47m) per year.
In another referendum vote yesterday, the Swiss rejected a proposal to make
it easier for children of immigrants to become citizens.

FT  13 JUN 94 / Delors jobs plan wins backing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Plans to promote flexibility in European labour markets which fall well
short of British-style deregulation are spelt out in an internal European
Commission progress report on last December's white paper on employment and
competitiveness by Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president.
The report was warmly welcomed at a meeting of the Commission last week and
will form the basis of Mr Delors' contribution to the European Council
meeting in Corfu this month.
The report, written by the employment task force at the Commission's
directorate general for social affairs, says the white paper has been judged
useful in all member states but 'a fragmentary approach is still noticeable'
and the need for 'collective action' has not yet been realised.
It also argues the white paper strategy is a medium-term one and that
progress at this stage must be judged in terms of 'trends and changes in
political positions'.
The paper is vague on the appropriate role for Brussels in promoting the
goals of the white paper. Reflecting the more cautious approach to
European-level employment legislation spelt out recently by Mr Padraig
Flynn, the social affairs commissioner, the report says Brussels should
encourage countries to 'pick and mix' elements of policy from different
national systems.
The paper welcomes progress made on the white paper recommendation to reduce
non-wage labour costs and approves of the steps being taken in countries
such as Spain to liberalise redundancy and dismissal legislation.
But it stresses that labour market efficiency is to be sought not through a
'dilution' of the European model of social protection, but 'through the
adaptation, rationalisation, and simplification of regulations, to establish
a better balance between social protection, competitiveness and employment
creation'.
The paper says deregulation means different things in different countries.
And in a coded dig at the British government, it says the burden of change
should not be borne by the weakest in society, which is 'the easiest, but
least acceptable, way of increasing access to jobs'.
A similar tone is adopted in a discussion paper on European employment
issues from the German government, which takes over the European Union
presidency next month. The Germans stress the importance of greater
flexibility in working hours but at the same time welcome the EU
working-time directive - bitterly fought by Britain - as an 'important
framework'.
The German government, like the British, wants to promote part-time work,
but the Germans' first priority in the employment field is to establish a
European directive laying down minimum standards for part-timers. Germany
has, however, failed to persuade the British government of the need for a
directive which ensures that pay and conditions must be the same, pro rata,
as that for full-timers.
The European Commission progress report concludes by warning about a return
to complacency on unemployment as economic growth picks up. It also chides
member states for failing to come up with more local level job creation
ideas and for failing to develop forms of 'top-up' state support which
encourage people to take low-paid work.

FT  13 JUN 94 / 'Slim' chance of 1997 currency merger
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The chances of a majority of European Union countries being able to merge
their currencies in 1997 are at best slim, Mr Henning Christophersen,
European economics commissioner, said yesterday, report Lionel Barber in
Brussels and Reuter in Basle.
Mr Christophersen said that the early target date for monetary union by 1997
would be 'very difficult'. There was a general consensus that 'it would be
better to wait until 1999'.
Mr Christophersen was speaking on the eve of the annual meeting in Basle of
the Bank for International Settlements, the central bankers' central bank.
His cautious pessimism contrasted with his usual upbeat assessments of the
prospects for an early move to Emu. The Danish commissioner may also have
had an eye on his audience. A new central bankers' report expresses concern
about the size of budget deficits in member states.
Last week, Mr Gunter Rexrodt, German economics minister, appeared to cast
doubt on the Maastricht treaty timetable for Emu by saying that a single
European currency might take until 2001 to realise.
Mr Rexrodt stressed that meeting the Maastricht criteria on inflation,
currency stability and government debts and deficits was far more important
than meeting the Maastricht dates.
Asked whether he agreed with the German assessment, Mr Christophersen
conceded: 'Unless we get 3 per cent (economic) growth in 1996 and more in
1997, it (Emu) will be impossible.'
Despite his cautious line, Mr Christophersen said that he did not want to
rule out 1997 altogether because that could prompt countries to scale down
their efforts to meet the Maastricht treaty targets. 'I don't want to
discourage everyone from trying to get there,' he said.

FT  13 JUN 94 / Lille's public transport sets an example for Europe: As
others lobby for a single line, this French city is extending its network
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first stop for many travellers through the Channel tunnel will be the
French city of Lille, a former textile and mining centre which has been
given new life by the creation of France's network of trains a grande
vitesse.
Strategically placed at a junction of the high-speed lines between London,
Paris and Brussels, Lille recently completed a new TGV station as part of a
FFr5.3bn (Pounds 625m) office development.
But civic pride in the TGV connection is matched by Lille's commitment to an
integrated public transport system for the city and the neighbouring towns.
Lille's approach to running its transport network provides some interesting
lessons parallels for local authorities elsewhere in Europe.
While on the British side of the Channel, Birmingham, the UK's second
largest conurbation, lobbies desperately for government funding for a single
high-speed rail line, Lille, a city of 1.1m people, is busily extending its
existing underground network, having just completed a FFr1.3bn upgrade of
its tram system.
It has financed its impressively modern infrastructure with the help of
government grants which meet 20 per cent of its investment costs and 25-year
to 30-year loans which cover 80 per cent. The loans are repaid in part by a
tax on local businesses.
Companies which employ more than nine people pay 1.6 per cent of their
payroll costs towards the municipality's transport bill. In return, their
employees travel for free on public network.
Proposals in the UK for a proportion of the business rate paid by London
companies to go towards funding the CrossRail project, an underground link
between the east and west ends of the capital, found little favour with the
Treasury.
Central to Lille's public transport network is its underground, the first
line of which was built to link central Lille with a new university suburb,
Villeneuve d'Ascq. Three years before London's Docklands opened its
overground automatic rail system in 1987, Lille began operating its own
underground driverless trains.
It currently has two lines in operation covering a total of 15 miles and is
extending the network to the neighbouring towns of Roubaix, Tourcoing and
ultimately the Belgian border, says Mr Bernard Guilleminot, director of
operations.
Safety on the underground platforms is enhanced by platform barriers which
open only when the train is in the station. Stations on London's Jubilee
Line extension in 1998 will have a similar feature.
The low operating costs of the underground system mean that revenues exceed
costs by 10 per cent (including interest charges) though the more
labour-intensive bus and tram networks cover only half of their costs.
Overall the entire transport network earned revenues of FFr380m against
costs of FFr530m in 1993. This deficit is met from city funds with no
contribution from the government to operating costs.
The creation of a high-tech underground system made Lille's 80-year old tram
network look inadequate, so in 1989 a decision was taken to replace track,
signals and the trams themselves. Some stations were put underground to
smooth traffic flows; station platforms were raised to align themselves with
the Italian-built trams, which run at speeds of up to 70kph.
To simplify journeys, Lille has introduced a travelcard similar to those in
use in London and other large British cities. This allows travellers to
switch between metro, trams and buses. But Lille has gone further by
extending the availability of its tickets to taxis. This allows travellers
from outlying suburbs to take a cab to reach their local underground
terminus. This taxi service requires two of the standard FFr7.50 travel
cards.
As part of its efforts to drive down costs, Socialist-run Lille - its mayor
is Pierre Mauroy, a former prime minister - has delegated the management of
its transport network to a private company, Transpole, part of the Via GTI
group, which runs the public transport systems of several other French
cities. Transpole won a five-year contract in a tender competition held in
1993.
If the cost of running the system is higher than expected Transpole's
profits suffer. But if receipts are greater than forecast, the agreement is
re-negotiated to reduce the windfall profit.
In many European cities improving public transport has been accompanied by
with tough restrictions on the use of the private car. But the new Euralille
office and retail complex arising alongside the TGV station and the nearby
metro station will provide no fewer than 6,000 car parking spaces.
Improvements to Lille's metro and trams have limited the increase in the
number of cars driving into the city centre but the city says there has been
no overt discrimination against cars.

FT  13 JUN 94 / Battle against terrorism is now MI5 main role, says
Rimington
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Three quarters of the work of MI5, the British security service, is now
focused on fighting terrorism, particularly in Northern Ireland, rather than
the infiltration of 'subversive' political groups or the type of
counter-espionage portrayed in spy novels.
The picture of the modern, post-cold war MI5 was drawn last night by Mrs
Stella Rimington, director-general of the security service, in an
unprecedented speech on television by the head of a secret service.
Since the collapse of Soviet communism, the threats to national security had
been transformed, Mrs Rimington said.
'Countering espionage now takes up less than a quarter of our resources;
half what it was three years ago, and a far cry from the position at the
height of the cold war,' she said, delivering the 1994 Richard Dimbleby
Lecture on BBC1.
The threat from subversion had also subsided, taking up less than 5 per cent
of MI5's time. In the past, activities of Communist party members in Britain
were the 'legitimate subject of attention' because of their 'subversive'
intent. Now, part of the little time devoted to countering subversion was
spent on extreme rightwing groups 'who are seeking to undermine democracy
through the exploitation of racial hatred and xenophobia'.
The service's overwhelming focus today was fighting terrorism, originating
both from within the UK and abroad, she said.
MI5's most important task was mounting intelligence operations to counter
the threat from Irish terrorism. 'The Provisional IRA, in particular, is a
sophisticated and ruthless terrorist organisation, and poses the most
serious threat to our national security.'
Until 1992, the Metropolitan Police special branch co-ordinated intelligence
work against all Republican terrorism, but the transfer of that function to
MI5 had meant 'a sharper focus, as well as a greater concentration of
resources'. Mrs Rimington said the security service was 'an important plank
in the defence of a free society and of its civil liberties'. However, it
was important that it was accountable and ensured 'the most intrusive
techniques' were used only 'to counter the most serious threat'.
The modern MI5 was composed of 'people from a variety of backgrounds About
half are female and half are under 40,' she said.

FT  13 JUN 94 / Tories humiliated in Euro-poll: Labour vote surges but Lib
Dems fail to match local election result
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European elections dealt another humiliating blow to Mr John Major's
government early today as the Labour party broke out of its traditional
regional heartlands to score heavy gains in London and southern England.
The Labour surge, which gave the party its highest share of the vote for 30
years, marked the first nationwide election since 1979 in which it had
effectively challenged the Conservatives on their own ground.
Sir Christopher Prout, leader of the Conservative group in the European
parliament, was a victim, losing his Herefordshire and Shropshire seat to
Labour.
The overall outcome, which saw heavy government losses in terms of seats in
Strasbourg juxtaposed against a high-than-expected Tory share of the vote,
appeared just enough to head off an immediate crisis for Mr Major's
premiership.
But as renewed Conservative divisions over Europe and over his leadership
emerged even before the votes were counted, a second bad showing - following
last week's five by-election defeats - left in place the question mark over
his longer-term future.
As results poured in, the Liberal Democrats won their first seats in the
Strasbourg assembly, taking two from the government. But outside its West
Country heartlands, Mr Paddy Ashdown's party saw its vote slump in a mirror
image of Labour's rise.
With results in three-quarters of the 84 mainland seats declared,
projections suggested the Conservatives' representation in the parliament
would fall to about 18 seats, around half the number won in 1989. Massive
abstentions by traditional Tory voters were reflected in the estimated
turnout of 35 per cent.
Among spectacular Labour gains were victories in Essex South, which includes
the symbolically important Westminster constituency of Basildon, and in
London South East, which covers a swathe of middle-class Tory parliamentary
seats in areas such as Bromley and Bexley.
Mrs Margaret Beckett, Labour's interim leader, said the results had
demonstrated unequivocally that Labour had established itself as an
alternative government.
But the divided opposition to the Tories in the south appeared to have saved
the government from the electoral 'melt-down' predicted in some opinion
polls. Mr Ashdown acknowledged the shift to the rival opposition party with
the comment that 'Labour has saved the Tories' bacon'.
Despite their victories in the south west, the Liberal Democrats' share of
the vote fell substantially from the 27 per cent recorded at last month's
local elections. The party failed to win target seats such as Hampshire
North &amp; Oxford and Wight &amp; Hampshire South as a result of the Labour
revival.
On the basis of BBC projections after most of the results, the Conservatives
would have 27 per cent of the vote, Labour 47 per cent and the Liberal
Democrats only 16 per cent. Labour, confident of winning more than
two-thirds of the 84 British seats in the Strasbourg assembly, claimed the
election outcome marked the beginning of the end of the Conservatives'
15-year grip on power at Westminster. The Conservatives lost seats to Labour
in East Anglia and the Midlands. Leicester, Norfolk and Northants &amp; Blaby
all fell early, followed by Lincolnshire &amp; Humberside South. Formerly safe
constituencies such as Thames Valley and Cotswolds were only narrowly held,
with large swings against the Tories.
Labour victories in Essex South, Essex West &amp; Herts East and Suffolk &amp; South
West Norfolk emphasised the opposition's resurgence in the south outside
London. London South East and London North West fell to Labour giving the
party all nine constituencies in the capital.
The Conservatives were left penned within a narrow band of southern English
constituencies like Surrey and Buckinghamshire where they managed to beat
off the opposition threat. The party now holds only one European
parliamentary seat north of the Wash, in North Yorkshire.
Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, signalled the start of a cabinet
operation to shore up Mr Major's premiership. Mr Hurd, who defended Mr
Major's strategy in the European campaign, said it would be 'absolutely
crazy' for the Conservatives to think about changing leader for the second
time in four years.
But hopes that the party's warring factions would maintain the fragile truce
which held during the European campaign were shattered by outspoken
criticism of Mr Major from both the right and left.

FT  13 JUN 94 / Right makes strong gains on Continent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Conservative parties in Germany, Italy and Spain swept to victory in
yesterday's European parliament elections, although the rightwing
government's score in France was badly dented by strong support for
anti-Maastricht dissidents.
Across the 12 European Union nations that voted in the elections for the
567-member assembly yesterday and on June 9, rightwing gains on the
Continent were offset by Labour's landslide win in the UK.
As a result, the relative strengths of the parties in the enlarged
Strasbourg assembly appear likely to be little changed compared with the old
518-seat parliament.
In the eight countries that voted for the parliament yesterday, Mr Helmut
Kohl, the German chancellor, emerged as the main victor, according to
computer projections. These indicated an unexpected triumph for Mr Kohl's
Christian Democratic Union and a considerable setback for the opposition
Social Democratic party, in what was virtually a dress rehearsal of
Germany's general election in October.
Computer projections on Germany's two main public television channels showed
the CDU and its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union, gaining
support in the European poll to almost 40 per cent, compared with 37.7 per
cent in the previous poll five years ago.
In contrast, the SPD, which was ahead in opinion polls until only weeks ago,
looked set to suffer its worst result since the first direct elections to
the European parliament in 1979.
General solid support for Christian Democrat parties on the Continent hit
socialist hopes of sweeping gains in the parliament in Strasbourg.
According to projections early this morning, based on provisional results
from all 12 EU nations, the Socialist group and likely allies at Strasbourg
assembly will have 213 seats compared with 197 in the outgoing parliament.
The Christian Democratic group and its allies will have 178 seats against
the previous 162.
Far-right parties did well in Italy and Belgium, while political
fragmentation was evident above all in France, where both left and rightwing
parties suffered from a sharp swing to two maverick groupings.
France's anti-Maastricht Another Europe list, led by renegade conservative
Mr Philippe de Villiers and Sir James Goldsmith, the Anglo-French tycoon,
won more than 12 per cent of the vote, according to Interior Ministry
figures.
The Radical Energy group led by Mr Bernard Tapie, the controversial football
boss, also took about 12 per cent, drawing away support from the opposition
Socialist party, which saw its share fall to 15 per cent from 23.6 per cent
in 1989.
In Italy, computer projections indicated sharp gains for prime minister
Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia party, projected to score more than 30 per
cent, up 9 percentage points from the March general election.
Italy's neo-fascist MSI-National Alliance achieved about 12.5 per cent,
compared with 13.5 per cent in the March general election.
Governing Christian Democrat parties achieved stronger than expected scores
in Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. The party's resilient showing in
those countries and in Germany may strengthen support for European
integration among EU 'core' members.
On the other hand, support for parties that oppose or are sceptical about
Maastricht in France and Italy, two traditional supporters of European
unity, underlined the confusion about the future of European co-operation.
In Ireland, the Greens won their first European parliament seat and were
poised to snatch a second, although the main victor was prime minister
Albert Reynolds's Fianna Fail.
The left suffered a drubbing in Spain, where the Socialist party of prime
minister Felipe Gonzalez lost ground heavily to the opposition conservative
Popular party. The Spanish Socialists' vote fell to its lowest point since
they came to power in 1982.
The governing centre-right PDS party of prime minister Anibal Cavaco Silva
was dealt a setback in Portugal, while Greece's governing Socialist
Panhellenic Socialist Movement looked set to win that country's vote.
In Belgium, the party of prime minister Jean-Luc Dehaene looked set to
remain the leading political group.
Early results in Luxembourg's general election, which was also held
yesterday, pointed to prime minister Jacques Santer's Social Christian party
remaining the biggest in parliament.

FT  13 JUN 94 / Major attacked as Tory campaign truce ends
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sharp divisions in the Conservative party over Europe and Mr John Major's
leadership re-emerged last night as the government braced itself for its
worst defeat in a nationwide election since the second world war.
Amid predictions that the Conservatives would hold on to at most half of its
32 seats in the European parliament, Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary,
signalled the start of a concerted cabinet operation to shore up Mr Major's
premiership.
The Labour party, confident of winning more than two-thirds of the 84
British seats in the Strasbourg assembly, claimed that the election outcome
marked the beginning of the end of the Conservatives' 15-year grip on power.
Mr Paddy Ashdown's Liberal Democrats predicted they would win their first
seats ever in the parliament, but opinion polls suggested that the surge in
support for the party earlier this year had been checked by a rise in the
Labour vote.
Mr Hurd, who strongly defended Mr Major's strategy in the European campaign,
said it would be 'absolutely crazy' for the Conservatives to think about
changing leader for the second time in four years. He told BBC Radio: 'We
have someone whom I believe to be an excellent prime minister.'
That view was echoed by Sir Norman Fowler, the party chairman, and Mrs
Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, as the cabinet prepared for a
backlash from disgruntled MPs when they return to Westminster tomorrow after
the Whitsun recess.
Characterising the European elections as the low point in the government's
fortunes, Sir Norman held out the prospect that strengthening economic
recovery would pave the way for tax cuts well before the general election
due by mid-1997.
But hopes that the party's warring factions would maintain the fragile truce
which held during the European campaign were shattered by outspoken
criticism of Mr Major from both the right and left.
From the right the prime minister faced calls for a radical reshaping of the
government's domestic policies combined with a toughening of the sceptical
approach to Europe which featured in the campaign.
Rightwing members of the executive of the backbench 1922 committee called
for another round of deep cuts during this summer's public spending
negotiations to open the possibility of tax cuts in the November Budget.
Leading Euro-sceptics echoed a weekend call from Mr Norman Lamont, the
former chancellor, for Mr Major to give a firm commitment that a
Conservative government would not participate in a single European currency.
But ministers on the centre-left of the party privately echoed sharp
criticism of the prime minister from its pro-European wing. In a warning
that Mr Major would depend crucially on their support if he was challenged
for the leadership, the pro-Europeans warned he must stop 'appeasing' the
Tory Euro-sceptics.

FT  13 JUN 94 / Austria links its future to Union in strong turnout: 66.4%
Yes vote in referendum gives big boost to EU confidence
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Austrians yesterday gave the European Union its first big vote of confidence
in several years, with 66.4 per cent voting in a national referendum in
favour of joining the Union.
The turnout for the referendum, 81 per cent, was equally impressive, in
contrast to the low participation in European parliamentary elections in
many countries yesterday.
Late in the afternoon, when the scale of the result became known,
enthusiastic crowds waving EU flags gathered at main political party
headquarters in Vienna and in front of the federal chancellery shouting, 'We
are the champions'.
Mr Alois Mock, the Austrian foreign minister, said: 'It proves that
Austrians are determined to play their part in building the new Europe.'
It is also a boost for pro-EU forces in Norway, Sweden and Finland where EU
entry referendums are due in the autumn. The wide margin of victory of the
Austrian Yes vote brought hope of a long-awaited lift to Nordic EU
supporters who have struggled to impart any momentum so far to their
campaigns.
More immediately, the Austrian Yes vote comes before three important party
congresses on the EU issue in Finland, Norway and Sweden next weekend, and a
parliamentary no-confidence vote due on Wednesday in Finland.
Mr Carl Bildt, the Swedish prime minister, welcomed the Austrian decision
last night as 'an important signal' to Swedes. 'That the result was so
strong was based upon the wish to influence the development of Europe. The
argument for influence won, and won big,' Mr Bildt said.
Only in Finland, where fear of neighbouring Russia is a major factor, is the
Yes campaign leading the referendum race in the opinion polls. In Sweden and
especially in Norway, the No campaigns hold a strong lead.
Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland, the Norwegian prime minister facing a No campaign
with well over 50 per cent support in the opinion polls, said Austrian entry
to the EU strengthened the opportunity to build bridges between western and
eastern Europe. The Norwegian No campaign had argued that the EU would shut
out poorer former eastern bloc countries.
The Austrian vote will be well received by the country's central European
neighbours. The Czech republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Poland and Slovenia all
hope that their interest in joining the EU will be taken up by Brussels soon
after the current applicants become members.
Respectable majorities in every province in Austria backed EU entry. Even in
Tyrol, where resentment over pollution from alpine lorry transit has
provoked strong anti-EU sentiment, the majority Yes vote was 56.4 per cent.
The handsome scale of the national majority raises questions about the
accuracy of opinion polls in the past week, which indicated a very close
race.
Government officials said yesterday their own polls showed many people were
shaken by scare stories put out late in the campaign by the anti-EU camp. It
was claimed, for example, that Austria, once it joined the EU, would have to
supply water to Spain and could be forced to build nuclear power stations.
Anti-EU campaigners, led by Mr Jorg Haider, the populist rightwing leader of
the Austrian Freedom party, combined these stories with posters recommending
that if people had any doubts they should vote No.
But late last week, the pro-EU camp responded strongly, dismissing the scare
stories and emphasising the importance of the vote for the country's future
security and prosperity.
Austrian leaders plan to sign their accession treaty at the EU summit in
Corfu on June 24. The country then becomes an official observer of EU
institutions from July 1 until its official entry on January 1 1995.

FT  13 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Securicor
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Cellnet has consistently underperformed Vodafone in market share, profits
and cash flow since both won their licences in the mid 1980s. But it is hard
to believe that Cellnet is worth only 45 per cent as much as its stronger
rival. Yet that is the implication from the way the market values Securicor
and Security Services, which together own 40 per cent of Cellnet.
Securicor, which owns 13 per cent of Cellnet plus 51 per cent of Security
Services, is valued at Pounds 830m. The 49 per cent of Security Services not
owned by Securicor is valued at Pounds 380m. That gives a grand total of
Pounds 1.21bn. On top of their stakes in Cellnet, the two companies have a
range of other businesses worth perhaps Pounds 270m. So the implied market
value of their 40 per cent Cellnet stakes is Pounds 940m, giving a value of
Pounds 2.35bn for the whole company. Vodafone's market capitalisation is
Pounds 5.2bn.
These relative values seem misjudged not merely because Cellnet's cash flow
is currently half Vodafone's and looks likely to rise faster. The
probability that BT, which owns 60 per cent of Cellnet, will eventually want
to take full control further enhances its value. Though BT is currently
prevented from doing so by regulation, little political capital has been
invested in maintaining the ban. And if BT were able to buy Cellnet, the
chances are that it would pay a premium because of the benefits from
integrating mobile services with its fixed network. All this leaves open the
question of whether Securicor is undervalued or Vodafone overvalued.
Investors could play safe by buying the former and selling the latter.

FT  13 JUN 94 / International Press Review: Indonesia - Jitters over foreign
investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MANUELA SARAGOSA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The widely-used derogatory Indonesian term for westerners is bule - which
translates as albino - and over the past week, the prospect of bule capital
entering Indonesia's media sector has been a hotly-debated topic in the
national press.
It was sparked off by a foreign investment deregulation package from the
government which promised to abolish restrictions on foreign equity and open
up sectors such as media, seaports, telecommunications, nuclear power,
railways and civil aviation, all of which had previously been barred to
foreign ownership.
Most newspaper editorials have indicated that, while they can tolerate
foreign ownership in most sectors, the media are off limits. Television
stations and newspapers, they argue, are the 'tools of national struggle'.
Leading that line of argument are the dailies Republika and Kompas, widely
regarded as pro-establishment newspapers. 'If foreign capital is allowed to
enter the press world in Indonesia many things can happen,' warned an
editorial in Republika last week. 'The spirit of nationalism may be given
second class status by the capital owners.'
In a country where political labels such as 'nationalist' or 'reformist' are
more appropriate than left-wing or right-wing, foreign investment
deregulation treads on sensitive ground. Nationalists argue that keeping the
national spirit alive and well is paramount because Indonesia's 180m people
are made up of hundreds of ethnic groupings.
Ironically, foreign investors have expressed little interest in placing
money in the Indonesian media because of the arbitrary restrictions imposed
on public debate. An editorial in the widely-read English language daily,
the Jakarta Post, which usually takes a reformist line, asked, 'Which
foreign media baron would be willing to invest millions of dollars in a
business that runs the risk of having its licence revoked at any moment for
publishing the wrong kind of information?'
In fact, deregulation of the media sector flies in the face of a law dating
from 1982 which stipulates that foreigners are not allowed to own newspapers
or broadcasting stations. Newspapers and government ministers fighting the
new regulation have not failed to point this out. But in a country where the
rule of law has yet to find its grip, all that has resulted is confusion.
The deregulation package appears to have been slapped together in a hurry in
order to counter falling foreign investment at a time when other Asian
countries are attracting strong inflows.
This point was not lost on the weekly Economic &amp; Business Review Indonesia,
which noted that because of the rush 'the impression that has been created -
intentionally or otherwise - is that there was a lack of co-ordination among
government agencies whose domains were to be reformed.'
The likelihood is that ministries did not bother to consult one another at
all. Foreign investors, used to this state of affairs, barely raised an
eyebrow when President Suharto was reported to have said that the media
would remain closed to foreigners only four days after the deregulation
package was announced by senior ministers.
Mr Suharto reacted to pressure from Mr Harmoko, information minister, who
teamed up with local journalists and publishers, arguing that foreign
capital in the media sector threatened Indonesia's national integrity and
exposed it to foreign influence.
It was a humiliation for the cabinet's economic team. Mr Sanyoto
Sastrowardoyo, chairman of the Investment Co-ordinating Board, was quick to
tell local reporters that people should give the reform team enough time to
review the whole package.
Attempts are being made to boost the role of parliament in policy formation,
instead of ministerial decree, but no one yet really knows how to go about
implementing new policies. 'There has yet to be a method of establishing
such vital policies as economic reforms which are then willingly accepted by
parliament, the executive branch of government and the people in general,'
said Business &amp; Economic Review Indonesia.
The latest foreign investment deregulation package differs from other
deregulation measures in that it introduces drastic changes in one go.
As a result, even the most reformist of newspapers have joined up with the
more nationalist ones in calling for caution from the government. 'A note of
caution is still in order,' an editorial in the Jakarta Post said. 'Extra
care is needed because the government should see to it that the entry of
foreign ventures will not harm the public interest.'
Phrases such as 'national interest' and 'public interest' have been used
repeatedly in discussing the deregulation package, although few editorials
have ventured to define them. Only Kompas tried to be more precise by
commenting that 'the government must remain in control of the economy so
that economic activities are truly aimed at bringing about prosperity for
the people as a whole.'
Although the government has become more tolerant of criticism over the last
year, perusing Indonesian newspapers is often an exercise in reading between
the lines. Kompas' comment on government control of the economy may have
been made with reference to foreign ownership of businesses but it is also a
reflection of growing concern throughout the country that gradual
deregulation of the economy over the past 25 years has done little to
improve the distribution of wealth.

FT  11 JUN 94 / Accountancy rules attacked
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Leading accountants yesterday criticised regulations published by the
government as part of its pledge to reduce the audit requirements for
smaller limited companies.
The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales attacked the
government for failing to consult adequately before issuing draft guidelines
which it said had resulted in 'bizarre transitional arrangements'.
Its financial reporting and accounting group said the regulations were
silent on the appointment, removal or resignation of the 'reporting
accountant' who would take the place of the auditor.
Touche Ross, the accountancy firm, has also written to the DTI saying the
regulations would require the reporting accountant to perform detailed work
which would all but nullify any attempts to reduce the regulatory burden.

FT  11 JUN 94 / Clinton tightens screw on Haiti
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Images of war cemeteries, military bands and proud old veterans have
surrounded President Bill Clinton for the last week, but they have done
little to change the unfriendly landscape that awaited him on his return
from Europe to Washington.
Yesterday Mr Clinton announced tighter sanctions against Haiti - an end to
all commercial flights and a ban on private financial transactions - but
foreign policy difficulties in Haiti still fester as in North Korea and
Bosnia.
In a Gallup poll conducted for CNN and USA Today, only 49 per cent of those
questioned found Mr Clinton honest and trustworthy, although 78 per cent
thought him 'a nice guy.'
As he approaches three crucial weeks before the July 4 congressional recess
candidates from his own Democratic party continue to distance themselves
from him, and even the Democratic National Committee's political director
acknowledged 'there are clearly some areas of the country where it's not
going to benefit a candidate to associate himself with Bill Clinton' - a
remark swiftly repudiated by the White House.
Next week, the president is expected to unveil his proposals for 'ending
welfare as we know it,' a plan built around limiting benefits from the Aid
to Families with Dependent Children programme, the cornerstone of the US
social safety net, to two years.
But the ambitious reform programme is probably stalled until next year as it
must take second place on the legislative agenda to health care reform,
making only slow progress. Mr Clinton faces a decision on how soon to
involve himself in the struggle. Until now, the White House has left the
Congress to fight over the details.
The battle of health care has not been made any easier by the indictment of
Congressman Dan Rostenkowski, formerly chairman of the ways and means
committee, on charges of fraud and embezzlement. He was arraigned in court
yesterday, and pleaded not guilty.
Mr Clinton's own legal travails have not gone away. He will soon have to
respond to the charges of sexual harassment filed against him by a former
Arkansas state employee. Congressional hearings on his investment in the
Whitewater property venture are also expected next month.

FT  11 JUN 94 / Lara's theme becomes a symphony: Dominic Lawson describes
how he learned - the hard way - to judge fine cricket talent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was January 1991. We were on holiday in the West Indies. I discovered
that, on a day too hot for sunbathing, a West Indian under-21 team was
playing a three-day cricket match against a touring Australian XI on the
island of St Vincent.
I persuaded my wife that we should take the little boat across to watch the
game: the locals said we really should go, if only to see a youth called
Brian Lara, whom they considered to be their most promising player since the
young Gary Sobers.
The ground on the tiny island was so primitive that there were not even
turnstiles or tickets. A man would simply stamp a 'pass' mark on the wrists
of those who paid to enter. While we were there, Lara scratched around for
20 or so runs before being caught in the covers.
I turned to my wife, and said, with all the authority of half-an-hour's
knowledge: 'I don't think this man Lara's all he's cracked up to be.'
Don't forget: you read it here first.
We are still in danger of underestimating the achievements of Brian Lara, in
the week that the little man has scored 501 not out, in a single innings
over a day and a bit, setting a record which, unless we return to timeless
Test matches, is unlikely ever to be broken.
The skill and strength involved in taking 390 runs off a first-class bowling
attack in a single day is almost unimaginable, and because of that, not
properly appreciated.
To the wider public it resembles a party trick, a magician's sleight of
hand. It needs to be put in the context of the game as a whole, rather than
a few other freakish achievements by Don Bradman or Gary Sobers.
If you play club or village cricket you will understand what I mean. The
best batsman in that game is, in that context, an impressive sight. He will
hit the ball ferociously, and probably score 100 runs against club players
you thought were rather good. The chances are that he once played for a
county second XI, when he was in his prime. But he was not good enough to be
a professional, let alone command a regular place in an English county's
first XI.
Imagine what a regular county player would do to your club's bowlers. But
even that player does not register more than a couple of points on the
cricketing Richter scale. Compared to a player selected for the England team
he is a plodding trundler, non-descript, untalented even. Then, imagine the
speed of co-ordination of the best batsmen in the England team, and attempt
to realise that, on a purely statistical calculation, they are several times
less good than Brian Lara.
Television is the medium through which the public appreciates the skills of
the first-class cricketer, the medium through which most people will witness
the genius of Lara.
But television hopelessly underestimates that genius. There is no sense,
through the foreshortened picture from the camera at the end of the ground,
of the fantastic speed of the ball, as it travels towards - and sometimes
away from - the batsman.
From the armchair sportsman's perspective, the batsman edging a ball into
the slips looks almost deliberately incompetent and the slip fielder who
drops the catch, sluggish beyond belief.
The same perspective, to a lesser extent, is shared by the man in the
stands, say 200 yards from the action; hence my fatuous remarks about Brian
Lara, when I watched him play more than three years ago in St Vincent.
But not much more than a year ago, I learned my lesson. I found myself
playing cricket in a testimonial match for the West Indian fast bowler
Courtney Walsh. By some strange chance I got him out.
When it was my turn to bat, Courtney grabbed the ball. Three times he
bowled, and three times I saw nothing. I just heard a percussive thump as
the ball hit the pitch and another thump as, a split second later, the ball
had travelled a further 20 yards into the wicket-keeper's gloves.
Courtney was not bowling his fastest, of course not, he did not want to hurt
me. He was probably bowling at the sort of pace which Brian Lara can hit at
a rate of almost 400 runs a day.

FT  11 JUN 94 / Private View: The real woman who plays a man's game -
Giselle Prangnell might have been a ballet dancer. But rugby hooked her and
now she lines up for England
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Her name is Giselle and she plays rugby for England. Not, to be sure, for
the side that hammered South Africa last Saturday but for the distaff side
that beat the US to win the women's world rugby championship last month.
At 5ft 6in and a little over 9 stone, Giselle Prangnell might easily have
become the ballet dancer her mother once dreamt of. Instead, she is playing
the scarcely less demanding role of fly-half for the women's team at London
club Wasps, and inside centre for England: her running, thinking, kicking
and tackling have earned her 14 caps and two tries.
OK. So there are girls who play football and girls who row. There are even
some who box to keep in shape. But rugby? That's a real man's game.
No longer. There are more than 300 women's clubs in Britain, some able to
field several teams, and the number continues to grow.
Giselle, 28, took up the game eight years ago at the suggestion of a
boyfriend because she was bored with netball and hockey. She was at Exeter
University and commuted to London every Sunday to play for the
quaintly-named Antlers Club.
'I'd got six phone calls from six different women I'd never heard of
before,' she said. 'So I said, 'All right, I'll be there, I'll be there.' I
went down the following Tuesday and I've never enjoyed myself so much.'
Didn't you find it a bit physical?
'Um. Initially, I think so. Sometimes when I watch men's rugby, or even
ours, and see the contact that goes on, it looks like madness.' She laughed,
happily.
'But when you're actually involved in the game, when you're hit, you're not
thinking that. You're thinking about what you've got to do with the ball
next, where you've got to be next. There are very few occasions where I've
felt the contact was a problem - and I'm quite quite small in comparison to
some.'
Yes, I said, ungallantly, I think I might get past you.
'It's not about size and weight,' she rebuked me. To illustrate, she
described making the 'fatal mistake' of once watching opponents, the French
national team, in training. Her opposite number was huge, and a crash
tackler.
'But on the first contact we had I just went really low, took her down, and
that was it. If anything, she had more trouble with me and Jackie (the
outside centre) than we had with her. It's all in the mind.'
What does rugby do for a girl that hockey doesn't?
'I find it the most complete sport I've ever come across. Because you have
to be there physically, you've got to be really fit - at the top level,
we're all athletes in one form or another - and you've got to be mentally
tuned. And you've got to have a really good knowledge of the game. It's very
tactical.'
I suppose you can drink 20 pints in a session as well?
'Oh my God, no]' she giggled. 'No, I couldn't, not by a long chalk.'
I imagine that some men come to your games hoping to see women wrestling in
mud.
'Some may come with that attitude, but they don't leave with it.'
The women's game has had favourable reviews from the commentators. It is
different, however: there is less kicking (good kickers are rare), more
running, and many more tries. But Giselle disagrees with those who have
compared the national team to a good schoolboy side. Technically, she said,
the women probably were better; they learned later in life and had developed
fewer bad habits.
Women have more fat on their bodies than men and cannot develop the same
muscle tone, however hard they train. Some, like Giselle, may bruise easily.
But there were few broken bones. One team-mate, a fierce tackler, had broken
her collarbone - but not on the field: she was flattened in the street by a
fleeing shoplifter.
'If people say you can't play rugby because it's physical contact, our
simple answer is: why not?'
Because you could damage yourselves, I said.
'All our reproductive organs, everything, is internal. It's all protected.
But, for a man, it's out there for all and sundry to kick and stamp over.
So, from the physiological point of view, a female's body is better
protected.' Nor, she said, were breasts particularly vulnerable. 'Men have
this idea that it's a massive problem for us. And it's just not.'
We associate girls with gentleness, consideration, deference. Are they like
that on the field?
'No,' she said, briskly.
Alternatively, we are told that when a woman is ruthless, she is more
ruthless than a man.
Giselle seemed to like the sound of that. 'We're very committed when we're
out there. We're there to win it. It's not like: 'All right, you got there
first, you have the ball.' We mean business as much as anybody else.'
Is there bad behaviour in the rucks?
'It's creeping in. But it's different to the men's game. You'll see very few
incidents. For instance, a lot will step over you if you pop out the wrong
side of the scrum. It depends how important the game is.'
But, I protested, isn't there something very unladylike about it all?
'Um. Yeah. I mean, I hardly think we look particularly feminine when we're
all covered in mud from head to foot. In some games, I'm sure you couldn't
tell when we leave the field whether we were a bunch of girls or guys.'
Even on the field, it is sometimes hard to tell from the beefy legs of the
scrummaging forwards - and some of these women weigh 13 stone - the cropped
hair-styles and quick running of the backs.
Was it part of the fun to defy the girly stereotype?
'No,' she said, firmly. 'There are misconceptions. I don't play sport to be
feminine or masculine. I play sport because it's an emotional release. I
always feel tremendous after I've exercised. It's a feeling of physical
well-being. I play rugby because I really enjoy it. I've always been sporty.
I come back into the rest of my life a more relaxed, a calmer, person.'
It is no secret that some women rugby players are lesbians. Giselle, who is
not, says sexual preferences have no more relevance in rugby than in tennis,
golf, athletics or any other sport. 'In men's rugby you've got giants, squat
ones, pretty boys in the backs,' she said. 'If someone looks butch or hasn't
got a pretty face, they get stereotyped.
'I couldn't care less what people do behind closed doors. My sport has
nothing to do with my sex life, with my relationships, with anything. It's a
completely separate part of my life, as is my work (she is a a physical
education teacher at Sheen Comprehensive in south-west London). What other
people do with their lives is their business.'
She agreed that women's rugby was a 'massive challenge' to men's ideas about
what women could or couldn't, should or shouldn't, do. Yet many little girls
 -'the tiniest, most feminine and pretty' - were keen to take it up.
'You don't have to be a certain type of woman to play. I still enjoy cooking
supper. I love being with kids. I want kids and all the rest of it, and plan
to do that. I never wear make-up to play my sport. I run out, play my sport,
am totally committed when I'm on the field. I then go in, have my shower,
put my make-up on, dry my hair. And I'm out and ready to be back into what
society expects of a female.'
If women's rugby got more of an airing on television, she said, finally, the
players would be seen for what they were: normal human beings, not freaks.
Nor was there any reason why women's rugby should not become an established
sport. 'To be honest, such limitations as there are - like we can't kick so
far - is what's now making it more attractive than men's. If ever we
overcome all that, maybe then we would just become a slower version of the
men's game. But, no, I can't see anything that would stop it, apart from
people's attitudes.'
So you expect to see a women's international played at Twickenham (the
headquarters of English rugby) one day?
'It's one of my ambitions. I'd love to.'
Giselle sprang from the sofa to show me the video of herself and her
team-mates in action in their world cup final. 'You should come and see a
game yourself one day,' she said.
I will, I replied. And I shall.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
A silly old baggage, or a fragrant and saintly woman? Deciding which of
those descriptions best fitted millionaire author Shirley Conran proved a
close call this week, after I had read, in OK] Magazine, that she was
shucking off the trappings of wealth and getting back to basics.
Who is Shirley Conran? I shall tell you. She used to be married to some
designer. Then she wasn't. Instead, she turned to book-writing - mainly
bodice-rippers - and made a fortune.
'But happiness for me now,' she told OK] Magazine, 'is the simple things:
sunshine, reading, writing, flowers, swimming, being with people I love.
I've had my fill of material possessions.'
So now she is discarding them. They include a property in New York, another
in Monte Carlo, her chateau, her Jag, most of her paintings, two secretaries
and Pounds 150,000 worth of jewellery, which she has given to 'five dear
people'.
To judge from her remarks, she will soon be a more modest and fetching
creature than the one displayed, garishly, across six pages of OK] Magazine.
One of the photographs shows her in the kitchen of her chateau wearing a
peony-coloured robe with matching Yves St Laurent pumps.
I believe she is on to something. So impressed am I by her return to basics
that I plan to follow her example. Starting today, I shall give away large
quantities of furniture, paintings, drawings, watercolours, sculpture,
jewels, musical and scientific instruments, books, manuscripts, radios,
televisions, clothes, cars, stocks, bonds and financial derivatives. As I
told Miss Lee, my executive assistant, the other evening, we only need one
Lawrence Alma-Tadema per room.
I shall urge the British government to do likewise by reviving John Major's
suggestion of a back-to-basics campaign waged by the entire population. John
Major is prime minister of Britain. But he is not blessed by luck. He has
the authority and the charisma of a paper cup.
So when, last year, he suggested that we re-address ourselves to basic
values - law and order, hard work, respect for our elders, family life  - it
was no surprise that his campaign was overwhelmed, almost at once, by a
cascade of scandals and sex frolics from within his own party.
But Major had a point, just as Conran has a point. We should get back to
basics. Life has become too complicated, thanks to the demented speed with
which we are pursuing the scientific and technological revolution. We are
over-reaching ourselves.
It is monstrous that the western democracies tolerate, within their borders,
any form of human wretchedness or hopelessness. Apparently, we cannot yet
feed, clothe, house, educate or care for ourselves properly.
More astoundingly, while millions of people live below the poverty line, we
are spending billions on arcane scientific research.
Some weeks ago Steve Jones, who is professor of genetics at the Galton
Laboratory of University College, London, told me that he was alarmed at
'the way people blame science and scientists for bad news of all kinds . . .
even ostensibly well-educated people hold science accountable for the things
it discovers'.
My objection is more sophisticated. I am not remotely anti-science. But I
sometimes wonder, while sat at home at night, waiting for Miss Lee to finish
dusting the Alma-Tademas, why we are spending so many man-hours on
scientific exotica when we have not yet scraped together the cash to house
and care for ourselves.
Why are we bothered, for now, with the origin of the universe? Or with
building high-energy accelerators to search for increasingly foppish
particles of matter? Or with attempting to understand the mysteries of human
consciousness?
For 300 years, the number of scientists has doubled every 15 years or so.
Things are getting messy. We should declare a 50-year interregnum in
scientific programmes that are not directly related to eradicating poverty
and hopelessness. While we are about it, we might as well wage war on all
causes of crime and disaffection.
Make a start today. Along with Shirley Conran, give away your wealth,
eliminate excess, cast aside vulgarity - and burn, if you have any, your
peony Yves St Laurent pumps.
Suddenly you will be feeling a much better woman.

FT  11 JUN 94 / Britannia struggles to stay afloat: Why the royal yacht
could be heading for stormy waters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEITH WHEATLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The elegant shape of the royal yacht Britannia has been highly visible at
the D-Day anniversary commemorations. Whether reviewing the fleet at
Spithead or anchored off Omaha Beach, Normandy, it has provided the Queen
with a floating palace.
But behind the scenes, a confidential civil service review body has been
putting the finishing touches to a report that could scupper the Britannia.
Both its running costs and low level of use have been under scrutiny.
'The president of the USA doesn't feel the need for a yacht,' says Welsh
Labour MP Alan Williams. 'It's shades of the British empire and the last
days of the Raj when the natives would be impressed by this great big boat
sailing in to their harbour. The Britannia is a throwback to a bygone age.'
At 408ft overall, the Britannia is not the biggest private vessel afloat.
That distinction belongs to the Abdul Aziz, owned by the Saudi royal family
and fitted out with gold taps and surface-to-air missiles - work done amid
great secrecy by the British firm Vospers. But it seldom leaves its home
port of Jeddah and creates nothing like the world-wide attention focused on
Britannia.
Earlier this year, the British vessel notched up its millionth sea mile. In
1993, it spent 157 days at sea. And this is the heart of its problem. In
motoring terms, the 40-year-old ship is an elderly Rolls-Royce with too many
miles on the clock.
Unlike classic cars, which can be kept safely in a garage until required, an
ocean-going ship must be able to tackle the worst weather imaginable in
total safety - especially if the head of state is aboard.
Britannia last had a thorough re-fit - upgrading its engines and other
systems - in 1987. This cost Pounds 17m. The next such overhaul is due in
three years and might easily cost three times as much. Whether to accept
this bill, or take a more radical route, is the choice facing the review
committee.
The Queen launched the vessel at John Brown's yard on the Clyde, near
Glasgow, in 1953 - the first year of her reign. The ship was very special to
the young monarch for reasons explained by her consort, Prince Philip, once
a Royal Navy career officer who commanded a frigate.
'Almost every previous sovereign has been responsible for building a church,
a castle, a palace, or just a house,' he said. 'The only comparable
structure built in the present reign is the Britannia.'
There was another, more poignant aspect. Victoria &amp; Albert, the previous
royal yacht, was a steam-powered relic of the 19th century, and was
unseaworthy. Doctors to the Queen's ailing father, King George VI, said his
failing health might be restored if he could undertake sea voyages.
But George VI died four months before the keel of Britannia was laid.
In the austerity of post-war Britain, economy was a watchword at the
shipyard. The lines for the new yacht were taken from two newly-built North
Sea ferries.
'Our brief was to build a robust structure with an ocean-going capacity. It
was also to be an advert for British shipbuilding at its best,' said Dr John
Brown, the yard's chief naval architect.
With such humble beginnings, it is a wonder that Britannia emerged for its
maiden voyage in 1954 with the classic elegance of line which can thrill
even its financial detractors. 'Its looks seem to improve with age,'
remarked Sir Hugh Casson, who designed many of the interiors in the onboard
royal apartments.
The trick is in the detail. The almost unnatural smoothness of the hull is a
result of Brown going back to Victorian shipbuilding techniques. Instead of
using rivets on the plating, internal butt straps joined the steel without a
mark or blemish on the outside.
Britannia's reputation became blemished, however, during the Falkland
Islands conflict in 1982. According to the Ministry of Defence, Britannia
was to have a front-line role as a hospital ship in wartime. Wards for 200
patients could be installed in the royal apartments, with operating theatre
and laboratory facilities in the bowels of the ship.
Yet when the time came, Britannia proved useless. It could not be sent to
the South Atlantic because it used heavy fuel oil and every other Royal Navy
ship used diesel. The SS Uganda, a cruise liner, was chartered instead and
Britannia sank a little in British public esteem.
The royal yacht has become a cuckoo-in-the-nest for the Navy. At the time of
its launch, the white ensign flew all around the world, fluttering above an
organisation possessing enormous manpower and equivalent budgets. Now, the
rear-admiral commanding Britannia and the 228 officers and men who serve
with him, take resources from a much smaller pool.
Conservative MP Julian Brazie said: 'At a time when the defence budget is
being stretched beyond belief and we have the smallest fleet since the 17th
century, I don't think funding of the yacht can be justified. Britannia has
no military capability whatsoever. It's as simple as that.'
In 1991/92, the last year for which official figures are available, the
personnel cost to the Royal Navy of manning Britannia was Pounds 4m. And the
financial compensations are few, with the main one being the promotion of
Britain's exports to hard-headed business leaders who still find an
invitation to spend a day on the Queen of England's yacht irresistible.
Even so, the royal family makes more use of the yacht: in 1992 the royals
spent 27 days aboard, while the commercial world spent only three.
It has been argued that if commercial use of Britannia was increased, the
Pounds 12m-a-year running costs could be transferred to a government
department such as the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI). Opponents,
however, argue that the yacht would then be turned into a mid-range
executive hotel, wiping out its royal cachet.
Within months, the review body will issue its recommendations on the yacht's
future. The options range from the scrapyard, to increases in funding.
The most radical step would be to sell Britannia and build a new yacht -
smaller, modern and much cheaper to run - with costs met by the Ministry of
Defence, the DTI or even the royal household itself.
If the 5,769-ton yacht, with one careful owner, went on sale, there would be
potential buyers. 'I think Britannia would be sold instantly,' said Jonathan
Beckett, a partner in yacht brokers Nigel Burgess Ltd. 'It would be the
kudos, not the boat. And it would have to be a fairly substantial owner to
afford the running costs. There are one or two Japanese institutions who
would find it intriguing to own that kind of yacht.'
Beckett believes Britannia is either worth a lot or very little: 'No
second-hand yacht has ever changed hands for more Dollars 30m, although that
ceiling is going to be broken very soon.'
Shipbuilding sources say that if Britannia were to be built today the
ex-yard cost would be close to Dollars 150m. However, as ship costs increase
exponentially with displacement, a 200ft yacht might cost only a quarter of
that figure, which might make a new royal yacht acceptable.
Rumours abound - but the small close-knit, super-yacht industry believes
that Britannia's days as the royal yacht are numbered.
There is nothing new in this debate, of course: the decision to build
Britannia was taken by the Neville Chamberlain's government in 1938,
although construction was delayed by the second world war.
Cabinet minutes state: 'In the course of the discussion, the importance was
emphasised of avoiding any possibility that the king might be exposed to
criticism by building the yacht.
'The kind of argument that might be used for political discussion was that
money was not available for the unemployed but could be . . . found for a
new yacht.'

FT  11 JUN 94 / As They Say in Europe: Improvements on Adolf and Uncle Joe -
How the press viewed the anniversary of the D-Day landings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Does this passage ring a bell? 'At the academy, we were woken in the middle
of the night to be given the news that another old boy had won the Knights'
Cross, with Oak Leaves. And an entire street would celebrate when a boy or
girl from it gained entrance to the Gymnasium.' This passage leads up to a
complaint that the German empire was lost without the consent of the German
people.
Well, it comes from Deutschland, Erwache ('Wake up, Germany'), which rather
gives the game away. In fact, all the above is taken from last week's
off-putting review in these pages of a new book by Paul Johnson called Wake
up, Britain, and has been transposed into German, as it were. Pretty
disagreeable it is, too, in this week of all weeks.
You might argue that this is a cheap point - but then, cheap points are the
specialites de la maison of this column. Clearly, British nationalism is
much less unpleasant than the German variety, and little that Johnson writes
would be out of place in a golf, or working men's, club.
In Germany, the expression of similar views would lead to public
condemnation. So it was that the press there treated the D-Day celebrations
as part of the continued 'burden of being German', as a book title of some
years ago had it.
The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung said it was right that the Germans
received no invitation to the Normandy beaches. 'On the contrary: it is
justified in historical terms, understandable in human terms, and
considerate even in German terms. It is worth taking another look at the end
of the Hitler dictatorship and the darkest chapter in our history. And the
clear dividing line between the National Socialist regime and the democratic
present of close partnership is to be welcomed.'
Die Welt asked, shrewdly, where Chancellor Kohl would have stood had he been
there: 'In the bow of Queen Elizabeth's yacht, on the bridge of the US
aircraft carrier George Washington steering towards the one-time German
positions, or perhaps standing in the ruins?'
On television, a presenter in Bonn asked his reporter on the beaches what
they were saying about Germany. 'In talking about the invasion, nobody
mentions Germany,' the reporter said. 'Nor does one hear the words Wehrmacht
or Nazi. It is all very diplomatic.' Only the Queen subsequently let the
dreaded N-word pass her lips.
The other absent friend was Russia. The government daily, Rossiiskaya
Gazeta, wrote: 'It is only the two major foes in that war - Germany and
Russia - who are not invited. One can understand why Germany will not be
present . . . The reason for not inviting Russia also seems clear: it would
be hard for the participants in the festivities to praise their own feats in
battle in the presence of those who made the major contribution to the
victory over Hitler's Germany.'
The paper concluded that the allies had postponed the landings deliberately
for two years after the original date in 1942 and preferred to 'snap off
pieces of the Wehrmacht in Africa or peripheral areas'. It continued: 'The
second front was opened just in time for the division of the spoils of war.'
Russia has, perhaps, not changed that much since the collapse of communism.
There were comments from elsewhere that might have jolted Anglo-Saxon
celebrants had they read them. In Paris, Le Figaro wrote on Monday: 'Without
De Gaulle, France would have been liberated by Anglo-Americans anyway . . .
(but) Paris would not have been liberated by its people and the second
armoured division.'
It concluded that there was an historical lesson here: 'History is made by
gambles, by appeals, by answers and silences, by will and inertia. Men . . .
are not mere cogs, they are the players.' History is made by myths, too.
Few in France, however, look back to the good old days of comradeship and
patriotism. This week, there was instead a certain desire to wrap together
the anniversary of D-Day and the European elections.
As one paper in the Pyrenees put it, western Europe today is much better
than other places, in spite of its faults. It added: 'The politics of the
middle way, which has eliminated extremes and whose programmes resemble each
other, is terribly lacking in conviction, as is shown daily by the
pusillanimity of pro-European discourse in this electoral campaign.'
Outside Britain, most people are quite glad that there are no Victoria
Crosses being handed out and that the empires have disappeared. Few
elsewhere lament that the political figures who led the invasion of Normandy
last week are not the giants of 50 years ago.
Others are more likely to be encouraged by the fact that Messrs Kohl and
Yeltsin represent a substantial improvement on theirs. But without Adolf and
Uncle Joe, Britain can hardly be expected to wake up.

FT  11 JUN 94 / Lunch with the FT: The billionaire grocer - Michael
Thompson-Noel raises the subject of money with David Sainsbury
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the richest people in Britain is sitting opposite me and has just
started his main course: piccatas of veal with courgettes, tomatoes and
olives. The British, he says, do not appreciate veal sufficiently.
For his starter, my billionaire guest had chicken and goat's cheese mousse.
And in a little while - no pudding - he will drink a single cup of filter
coffee before saying goodbye and going to look for his driver.
We are enjoying our chat, although I have not yet raised the subject of
money. I have held myself back - anxious, I suppose, to demonstrate
sensitivity for someone whose wealth is so ginormous that the noughts on the
end of it swirl round and round our heads.
This is David Sainsbury, 53, chairman and chief executive of J. Sainsbury,
Britain's leading grocery chain. In the 1994 edition of The Sunday Times
survey of Britain's richest residents, he and other family members were said
to be worth a combined Pounds 2.7bn - less than Gad and Hans Rausing, the
TetraPak brothers (Pounds 5.2bn), or Queen Elizabeth II (Pounds 5bn), but
comfortably ahead of John and Peter Moores (Pounds 1.7bn), John Paul Getty
II (Pounds 1.65bn), Garfield Weston (Pounds 1.6bn) and the Duke of
Westminster (Pounds 1.5bn).
I have no idea how accurate these estimates are; nor does The Sunday Times.
And I am not about to ask David Sainsbury if he knows, because I am sure he
doesn't. But the subject must be broached, even if obliquely, in the middle
of the piccatas.
'Is it true,' I ask, 'that you personally own 18 per cent of Sainsbury's
shares?' In spite of the recent stock market shake-out, Sainsbury's is still
capitalised at a squeak under Pounds 7bn.
'I think,' he says quietly, 'that it's 17 per cent.'
'Are you aware of your wealth - of how much money there is behind you and
around you?'
He does not mind the question. I have realised, already, that David
Sainsbury, for all his modesty and thoughtfulness, is a master of
directness. Nothing seems to throw him. It is clear, moreover, that he has
come here to talk. He speaks lucidly and treats all questions with
indulgence: a five-star interviewee, though he would be surprised to be told
so.
He has neatly-cropped hair and lightly-framed spectacles, and has been
described, quite accurately, as resembling an Israeli general in mufti.
'The enjoyable thing to do with wealth,' he says, 'is to achieve change.
Awareness of wealth depends on how you are brought up. In those days' - his
childhood - 'Sainsbury's wasn't a public company, so there weren't any
shares. Anyway, my parents taught me that if you had money, you used it for
good purposes. There was never any question about your not working. I am
sure that my upbringing is the reason why I enjoy using my money in
constructive ways.'
He joined the family firm in 1963 and held a succession of posts, including
that of finance director for 17 years to 1990. Then he became deputy
chairman and took over as chairman from his cousin, Lord Sainsbury, late in
1992.
When he became chairman, he told the FT: 'Food retailing is a very dynamic
and a very competitive business. It is a market of changing fortunes. We are
leaders now and it is absolutely my intention to have a bigger lead when I
cease to be chairman. But we will only do so by changing our business. I am
certain we will be a very different business in 10 years' time.'
He lives modestly and is not at all interested in the trappings of wealth.
In January 1993 he donated Pounds 200m worth of Sainsbury's shares to his
philanthropic vehicle, the Gatsby Charitable Foundation, a grant-making
trust which he established and has funded since 1967. The donation was
easily the biggest of its kind in living memory. The trust's activities
include technical education, African development programmes, economic and
business research, support for disadvantaged children, health care and plant
science.
We met at the Kensington Place restaurant in Notting Hill, west London. It
is bright, noisy, hip and crucial - renowned for serving a mixture of modern
brasserie food and more classical dishes cooked with immense flair. You can
have a set three-course lunch for Pounds 13.50: probably the best-value
lunch in town.
The Sainsbury's chairman told me that he used to be a regular at Kensington
Place a couple of years ago. 'Then I stopped, and then I started again,
about a month ago, and remembered how much I enjoyed it.'
If he had not been born a Sainsbury, what would he have become?
'Well,' he said, 'I studied history first, at Cambridge, and then
psychology, and there was a time when I thought I'd do research in
psychology: brain studies, perception, that sort of thing. Then I decided
that I'd make a much better businessman. But science, especially cognitive
neuro-science, has become so remarkably interesting . . .'
'You're not religious?'
'No.'
'So you're not worried about looking for the soul?'
'No. But that is not to say that human consciousness is not still totally
mysterious. And there is still, for me, a distinction to be drawn between
human consciousness and computer intelligence.'
After a few years' work for the family firm, he studied for an MBA at
Columbia University, New York, and then threw himself once more into
high-powered grocery retailing.
'The great attraction of business - particularly of retailing - is that
there is a very clear relationship between what you do and the end product.
It's very hands-on. You get instant feed-back. With politics, in contrast,
it is very unclear what actually results from what you do.
'I get real pleasure from visiting our stores. I could also get real
pleasure from running a factory.'
'A factory? Really? I detest them.'
'It's the challenge of integrating people and product flows so as to achieve
something worthwhile that fascinates me.'
I said: 'Could I go out there this afternoon' - I pointed to the high street
 -'and lay down the foundations of a retail chain that would eventually grow
as large as your great-grandfather's business has become today? Could I do
that?'
'Yes,' said the billionaire grocer, 'though you couldn't just launch a chain
of supermarkets. People seldom realise how complicated our business has
become. That is its challenge: to bring an enormous range of products from
all over the world into a specific place and to sell them so as to meet
predicted demand at a particular price.
'For example, we are bringing in skate from the US. Americans don't like
skate. They throw it in the harbour. But we are using new-technology packs
that enable us to bring this skate into Britain.'
Does he like food? 'Yes. It has always been a passion for the whole family.
You should only work in businesses where you have great regard for the
product. Play-back is essential. I was finance director for all those years,
yet you can only get so far on the figures or, indeed, on market research.'
'Do you cook?'
'Only bachelor cooking.'
'I was surprised,' I said, 'at Sainsbury's recent contretemps with Coca-Cola
caused by your selling a look-alike own-label cola that Coke claimed
resembled, in the appearance of its packaging, its own product far too
closely. One thinks of Sainsbury's as excessively well behaved. Why did you
get into such a scrape?'
The billionaire did not flinch. He said: 'Fifty-five per cent of our
(packaged grocery) sales are own-label. We have always been in the business
of finding better-value products than the branded ones. For the first time,
a cola has been found that is as good as Coca-Cola. This is a new situation
for Coke. The issue of the tin is, frankly, rather irrelevant.'
'But what about your behaviour? Suppose someone came along and helped
themselves to a bit of Sainsbury's glamour, or Sainsbury's expertise -
something established over a great many years - and stuck it on to their
product. Would you be happy?'
'They've done that,' said the chairman. 'Sainsbury's own-label wine
products, for example, have been copied by other people. In the end, the
consumer will decide. Instead of taking a year for everyone to try our cola,
it's taken about two weeks.
'The affair was portrayed as branded product versus own-label. But if you
look just at the branded sector for a moment, you will see that there are
things that designers do all around the world, in terms of packaging.
'One of their design conventions is that red is the colour people associate
with cola tins, so it is hardly surprising that our cola tin resembled
Coke's.
'Anyway,' he said happily, draining his coffee, 'our cola is selling
unbelievably well.'
He smiled. And then he stood - leaving me to reflect that billionaire-style
grocery must be an amusing thing to be in.

FT  11 JUN 94 / Travel: An unforgettable night in a room in Mandalay - After
a Chinese meal with a German doctor, Mark Hodson extricates himself from a
tricky situation at the Hotel Venus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK HODSON

<TEXT>
Burma is not famous for its nightlife, and with just cause. At 9pm the one
TV channel closes down after showing exactly three hours of state propaganda
and marching band music - after which you can wander out and find all the
restaurants shut.
It was a Saturday night in Mandalay, city of kings and Rudyard Kipling. I
was sharing a room at the Hotel Venus with a German doctor and we had eaten
Chinese at Min Min Restaurant followed by strawberries and vanilla scoops at
the Nylon Ice Cream Bar. We would have gone to a bar but there are none.
We returned to the room to find that the air-conditioning had packed up and
the boy downstairs was playing old Rod Stewart videos over the hotel cable
system. We were resigned to another game of chess when there was a knock on
the door and two young Burmese men, grinning and stripped to the waist,
asked if we would like to come next door for a drink. It sounded rather
dubious, so we thought it best to decline.
'We do have some cold beer in the fridge,' one said.
Inside, their room looked like a battle-ground. It was strewn with every
possible discarded bottle and food carton. On each of the two beds sat a
girl in T-shirt, shorts and high heels, both about 17 years old, wearing
gormless grins.
The boys cleared a space for us on one of the beds by sweeping some rubbish
on to the floor. They poured some beer and told us their names, ignoring the
girls, who just giggled. Clearly they had not been invited for their
dazzling conversation.
The boys told us they were in Mandalay to sell rubies. They lived in Mogok,
a mining village in the mountains to the north, an area off-limits to
foreigners. Business, said one, raising a glass, was very good.
I had seen something of the ruby trade at a place called Taung-gyi, about
eight hours out of Mandalay. The gem market on the edge of town was a
raucous den of sharks and smugglers: hill-tribe men, Bangladeshis, Indians
and Chinese.
As I dodged between the tightly-packed stalls where crowds huddled over
piles of uncut stones, I found myself instinctively clutching my money belt.
But in a country so poor and almost entirely deprived of western goods, I
had never seen such ostentatious wealth: chunky gold necklaces, designer
labels, fistfuls of dollars.
As one of the boys topped up my glass the door opened and in walked two
Indian men. One was tall, a little awkward, the other short and powerful,
about 45, with piercing eyes and a face as hard as any I have seen. A
striped green shirt strained to contain his thick arms, and around his neck
hung a thick gold chain. He took us in with a glance, then fired some
questions at the boys in a language I did not recognise. Then he turned to
us with a cruel smile.
'Like these girls?' he asked.
'Very nice,' I said diplomatically. In fact they were quite ugly. Despite
their puppy fat, they looked as though they had worked more nights in seedy
hotel rooms than they had eaten hot dinners. And they were becoming a
nuisance. One had moved behind Axel, the German, and was trying to massage
his shoulders; the other sat beside me with one hand across my leg.
One of the boys asked me: 'Have you used a Burmese lady yet?' I said no. He
asked why not.
'Er, perhaps I haven't met the right girl yet,' I said. I was thinking this
would be a good time to leave when the door opened again and in walked two
more men, a tall bearded Indian and a Burmese boy of about 14 with a shaved
head. It was getting to be quite a party.
The newcomers stood admiring their unexpected guests as we made polite
conversation about the ruby business while I kept one eye on my drink. I was
wondering whether it was spiked, and was keeping a hand on my leg to ward
off the prostitute.
Suddenly, Axel leapt up from the bed as if he had sat on a cattle prod. 'OK,
where is it?' he yelled.
There was silence, and a little nervous fidgeting. 'Someone has got my
wallet. I felt it taken out of my pocket. Now where is it?' Axel was
furious, his voice rising and his German accent thickening.
I thought: I should have seen this coming. Our hosts looked stunned and
indignant, spluttering denials.
Axel moved towards the door, saying: 'No one leaves here until I get it
back.'
I drained the last of my beer and held on to the glass. I knew what had to
be done. I had seen enough movies. I would break the end off the glass and
thrust it into the tough guy's face. What would happen then I had no idea.
Slowly I stood, not scared, just disappointed that an interesting evening
had to end like this. The Burmese boys remained slouched on the other bed,
their grins barely flickering. The hookers seemed to notice nothing amiss.
The three Indians regrouped slightly in the middle of the room and the
skin-head made a dash for the door where Axel stopped him.
Axel was still ranting, the Indians insisting on their innocence. Things
seemed to be coming to a head. I suggested a compromise: Axel would go next
door for two minutes while they had a last look around for the wallet. If it
turned up we would all be friends again, no questions asked.
They agreed. Axel left, while I stood by the door feeling foolish and trying
to act as if this sort of thing happened all the time.
Suddenly, Axel reappeared clutching his wallet. 'So sorry] It was in the
room all along,' he announced with a big smile.
The Indians were furious and the little tough guy ran at us shouting and
swearing in Hindi and English. How dare we insult him, did we not know he
was a very, very rich man?
'Look at this ring,' he said, shaking a fat fist in front of our faces. On
one finger was a band of huge rubies set in gold. My heart sank. I was
filled with shame.
Axel seemed too delighted at recovering his wallet to notice danger. He even
suggested another drink. I tried to cool the situation, explaining that we
were stupid tourists, a little drunk maybe. It had been a long day.
The tough guy was bouncing up and down with rage, veins bulging on his face.
Above all he seemed upset at the implication that he was down on his luck
and needed the money. As Axel grinned, I carried on grovelling.
The tall bearded Indian calmed things down by clutching his chest, saying:
'Oh my God, I was so scared, my heart was going boom, boom, boom. But you
must understand this cheating is not the Burmese way. In India someone will
rob you. In London too. But in Burma - never.'
I knew he was right. The Burmese people were just too sweet-natured. This
was the country where village children blew kisses at tourists instead of
asking for money, and waiters in restaurants used the menus to fan diners as
they ate.
Finally we left, backing out with our tails between our legs, shaking hands
with everyone twice and then a third time. As we fumbled with the door key
the tough guy followed us into the corridor and for a second, fear once
again gripped my stomach.
But his face cracked open with a smile: 'Are you quite sure you don't want
to borrow the girls tonight?'
Return flights to the Burmese capital, Rangoon, from Bangkok cost around
Pounds 150 and it is now possible to fly direct from Chiang Mai in northern
Thailand to Mandalay.
The government of Burma, now renamed Myanmar, has recently been issuing
four-week visas which take two working days to process in Bangkok.
On arrival, foreigners must change Dollars 300 into non-refundable foreign
exchange certificates. However, their value on the black market is almost
the same as cash: around 100 kyats to the dollar, against the official
exchange rate of six.
Burmese hotel standards are acceptable, although most are expensive by Asian
standards.

FT  11 JUN 94 / Travel: Do not miss Marple, an old Spaghetti Junction - The
Manchester canal network is a cascade of inventiveness on a scale not seen
in Britain since the Romans left
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Had Steven Spielberg lived in England 200 years ago, he might have been a
canal builder. These people used wit, technology and imagination to build
transport systems that - judged by what had gone before - must have seemed
out of this world.
The thought hits you as you stroll along a remarkable stretch of inland
waterway near Marple, a small town on the south-eastern edge of Manchester's
urban sprawl, sited just as the land climbs towards the Pennines.
There is nothing elegant or notable about Marple, the birthplace of
dramatist Christopher Isherwood. Or so you think until you encounter, near
an undistinguished shopping centre, the meeting place, 500ft above sea
level, of three important lengths of canal constructed during the industrial
revolution.
Curving south-east from Marple is the upper branch of the Peak Forest Canal
connecting with the limestone quarries near Buxworth, Derbyshire, four miles
away. The second length is the lower branch of the same canal stretching
north through the Manchester conurbation, while leading off to the
south-west is the Macclesfield Canal linking, eventually, with
Stoke-on-Trent and the Midlands.
In the early 19th century, when the canal system was at its busiest, Marple
must have taken on the character of a watery Spaghetti Junction. Today, with
holiday barges constituting the main traffic, the town's canal area is
quietly picturesque.
From Marple, an attractive walk runs along the towpath of the northern
branch of the Peak Forest canal, past an impressive sequence of 16 locks
that brings the water down 200ft through a horizontal distance of about a
mile. A little after this is the famous Marple aqueduct, built, like the
rest of the Peak Forest system, by Benjamin Outram, who also operated an
ironworks in Derbyshire.
The aqueduct is a test for anyone with vertigo. It takes the canal and
towpath across three arches spanning a gorge above the River Goyt 100ft
below. Notable features are the three circular 'shoulders' pierced above
each arch which reduce the weight of the structure and add decoration. A
similarly pleasant touch is the use of two different colours of gritstone,
yellow and pink, in the upper part of the aqueduct.
After the aqueduct, the route takes you past the occasional mill building
through a wooded, semi-rural setting before the canal hits Romily. Here,
next to the watercourse, you can buy a home-cooked hot meal amazingly
cheaply at the unpretentious Bridge Cafe.
Marple is one stop on a 100-mile network of canals around Manchester mainly
built in the late 18th and early 19th centuries in a cascade of
inventiveness that ended a 1,500-year blight in transport planning. With
railways only a gleam in the eye and most roads little better than dirt
tracks, nothing like the canals had been seen since the Romans left.
The canal building, which reached a peak in the 1790s, was driven by a
strong economic imperative: the need for reliable transport systems to ferry
the goods turned out by the world's first large-scale factories.
Today, the Manchester network, known as the 'Cheshire ring', is largely
intact. It sketches out a rough triangle, linking Manchester in the north,
Hardings Wood near Congleton in the south, and Runcorn in the west. In
hillier parts of the region, the watercourses reduce the need for locks by
following contours, so that on maps they are barely distinguishable from
rivers.
While canal aficionados might insist on hiring a boat to explore the system,
most people will probably not want to go to this trouble. Anyhow, walking
along discrete parts of the network gives you a better idea as to how the
canals fit into their localities.
Anyone interested in the ring will probably want to spend some time in the
centre of Manchester, where public and private money has financed the
cleaning of a large section of waterway, including parts of the Bridgewater,
Rochdale and Ashton canals.
The remains of the Castlefields Roman fort near the new G-Mex exhibition
centre may look a little spoiled - and are very hard to make sense of - but
on the whole the area adds up to an impressive example of urban
regeneration.
Particularly recommended is a one-mile walk along the Rochdale canal through
central Manchester. Taking in a sequence of warehouses and lock keepers'
cottages, it gives an inside-out view to the city which cannot have changed
much over two centuries.
Slightly further to the west is Britain's first length of modern man-made
waterway. A section of the Bridgewater canal, it was opened in 1761 and
connected the coal mines at Worsley, owned by the young Duke of Bridgewater,
to Manchester's city centre. The construction expertise came from the
engineer James Brindley and the surveyor John Gilbert.
Anyone wanting something more rural will probably head for the 20-mile
section of the Bridgewater canal further south, including the route through
pleasant countryside around Dunham and Lymm. Ancient Lymm, virtually sliced
in half by the canal, which cuts through the town square, is especially
worth a visit. Pleasant modern houses have their gardens gently extending to
the canal bank, and some old canal buildings have been converted to a
cruising club.
A little further to the west, the late 20th century intrudes. A massive
bridge takes the M6 motorway over the Bridgewater canal, the River Mersey,
the Manchester ship canal and the A56 road. Unless you are really interested
in concrete technology, you will turn around and head for home.

FT  11 JUN 94 / Travel: Wealdway's hike through English history -
Christopher McCooey describes a walk through vineyards, hop gardens, Saxon
hamlets and Norman churches in south-east England
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER MCCOOEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
You do not have to go to the ends of the earth to 'travel'. You can make a
journey through a locality or follow a river or path that is on your
doorstep.
After 30 years of travel - not non-stop, but certainly extensive - that has
taken me throughout south-east Asia and the far east, to Pacific islands, to
north America and northern Europe, I have discovered that it is just as
pleasurable to travel in my own locality.
Every day, either walking my children to the village school or exercising
the dog, I see distinctive black-on-yellow 'WW' tags - for Wealdway - on
stiles or gateposts, which explains why I found myself at Gravesend, Kent,
recently.
The Wealdway starts at the River Thames and ends on the chalk cliffs of
Beachy Head overlooking the Channel at Eastbourne. In between you have 80
miles, mostly on public footpaths, of some of England's most varied scenery
 -wind-swept heathered heath, lush meadows beside meandering rivers, mature
oak and beech woodland, and grasslands. And a history and land-use of equal
variety.
The Wealdway takes you past neolithic burial chambers, through vineyards and
hop gardens and pick-your-own fields of strawberries and runner beans, at
times following a Roman road, to Saxon hamlets and Norman churches.
It crosses farmland with serried fruit trees carefully tended or paddocks
where racehorses stand at stud, skirting Elizabethan iron foundries and
Georgian homes. Eventually it leads to the sea, where you may look out over
one of the world's busiest shipping lanes towards France, just over the
horizon.
This corner of the British isles, pointing to Europe and, only 8,000 years
ago, joined to it, has been the entrance-way through which passed the main
peoples and armies and trade that have shaped Britain over the centuries.
From Europe came hunters and farmers who could work bronze and iron. They
were followed by the legions of Rome, the Jutes under Hengist and Horsa, the
Angles and Saxons. Then came the Norman knights led by William who landed at
Pevensey, just east of Eastbourne, and later the Flemish weavers. The
Wealdway is a hike through history with surprises along the way.
One of the first is the memorial to Princess Pocohontas Rebecca Rolfe in St
George's church, overlooking the grey Thames at Gravesend. Daughter of the
Algonquin Indian chief Powhatan, she was taken hostage in 1612 by the
English settlers who had founded the colony of South Virginia. They hoped to
ransom her in exchange for eight settlers held by Powhatan.
Her gentle disposition endeared her to the colonists. She was taught
English, converted to Christianity and fell in love with a man called John
Rolfe, whom she married in 1614; they sailed for England in 1616.
In the churchyard of St George's is a bronze statue of Pocohontas, a replica
of the one in Jamestown given by the people of Virginia in 1957, the 350th
anniversary of the founding of the colony.
On the outskirts of Gravesend the first of numerous Wealdway signs can be
seen on a stile beside the Tollgate Moat House, just south of the A2 road.
The first few miles are over the North Downs. You are on chalk. The fields
are wide and the soils light with pieces of flint. A hard stone, it was
indispensable to the earliest settlers of this upland area. If the land has
been recently ploughed, you will have no problem finding flint, a lump of
which makes an unusual paperweight.
Soon you descend the scarp of the downs. Impenetrable blackthorn keeps you
on the steep track. At the foot of the slope are the Coldrum Stones; they
are what is left of a 90ft-long burial chamber, thought to be the family
vault of a chieftain who lived in the New Stone Age (2,500BC-3,000BC). It is
similar to tombs in Germany and Holland and could have been erected by
invaders from those areas who followed ancient tracks along, or at the foot
of, the chalk uplands.
Pressing on towards the River Medway, you enter the Garden of England - acre
after acre of apple, pear, plum and cherry trees. Richard Harrys, 'fruiter'
to Henry VIII, was the yeoman who first established the growing of fruit in
Kent. In 1533 he bought a farm and 'with great care and no small labour
brought from beyond the seas the sweet cherry, the temperate pippin and the
golden reinette'.
Continuing through Tonbridge, Bidborough and Speldhurst, the Wealdway leaves
behind the busy, intensively-farmed land on the clay soils. Gaining height
by undulations, passing through much more woodland with outcrops of
sandstone, you approach Ashdown forest, at 732ft the highest point on the
Wealdway.
This is all that remains of the great forest that the Romans called Sylva
Anderida, which formerly covered much of the Weald. With its obstinate clay,
general dampness and thick forest, Anderida might have been skirted by the
practical Romans. But they hacked a highway through the middle of the Weald
 -there is a section of it still to be seen beside the Wealdway at Camp Hill
in Ashdown forest - because they wanted the iron ore which was found there
in abundance.
The Weald iron smelting industry went into decline after the Romans left
Britain, but was revived in Elizabethan times. At Buxted, on the Wealdway,
an ironmaster named Ralph Hogg cast the first English cannon in one piece in
1543. Weald cannons blasted the armada of Spanish galleons that came up the
Channel in 1588.
Some of the fine houses you see along this section of the Wealdway (Hendall
Manor, Hogg House, Tickerage Mill) were built with the profits from iron,
and many of the ponds are 'hammer ponds', streams dammed to turn
water-wheels which drove huge bellows and hammers that smelted and forged
the ore into iron.
At the southern end of the Wealdway you come once again to chalk downland.
The trail goes right up to the feet of the Long Man of Wilmington, a huge
figure - at 230ft the largest in Europe - human but sexless, cut into the
north-facing scarp, 'looking naked towards the shires'. Its origins remain a
mystery. An Iron Age fertility god? The work of the monks from the nearby
priory in medieval times? An 18th century squire playing a joke on the
archaeologists? It is just one more surprise on the Wealdway.
The Wealdway is marked with distinctive tags on gates, stiles and posts. It
can be walked in all seasons although Ashdown forest can be bleak in winter.
It is probably best in spring and early summer when the flowers are at their
best, or in October and November, when the colours can be spectacular.
After rain, sections of it can get very sticky. Light-weight hiking boots
with good ankle support are recommended, and it is a good idea to take a
small back-pack for snacks, a change of clothes and rain-gear.
There are a number of guides to the Wealdway. Constable publishes A Guide to
the Wealdway by John Mason (Pounds 6.95). It includes much useful
information such as opening times for shops, castles and museums, early
closing days (usually Wednesdays and Saturdays) for post offices, pubs that
offer accommodation and/or food, and details of public transport.
The Ramblers' Association, Kent and Sussex area (11 Old London Road,
Brighton, Sussex BN1 8XR, tel: 0273-883306) publishes a slimmer guide which
you can slip into your pocket when walking (Pounds 3.50) and a list of
Wealdway accommodation and transport services which it updates periodically
(Pounds 1).
Both guides have their own long-distance footpath maps drawn in sections,
but the Ordnance Survey Landranger 1:50,000 maps are recommended to place
the Wealdway in relation to surrounding countryside, and to enable you to
pre-plan detours to historic sites or villages. The Wealdway is marked on
the OS maps; you will need sheet numbers 177, 188, 198 and 199, obtainable
from Stanfords, Map Centre, 12-14 Long Acre, London WC2.
The easiest way to get to Gravesend from London is to take one of the
frequent British Rail trains from Charing Cross. From Eastbourne, there are
hourly trains back to London. If you do not want to walk the whole distance,
the Wealdway is never far from a bus stop or train station that will get you
back to civilisation. Allow at least four days to walk the Wealdway
non-stop, or else plan to do the hike over a number of weekends.

FT  11 JUN 94 / Property: How to salvage a living - Clive Fewins meets a duo
determined to save architectural antiques
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE FEWINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Thornton Kay and Hazel Matravers reckon that 25,000 tons of reusable
building materials are buried in landfill sites in the UK every working day
 -and that there is money in telling people about the fact.
The money has been minimal and hard-won. But 2 1/2 years into their venture
the couple still voice their feelings with a passion.
'Many of these discarded building materials are architectural antiques more
than 100 years old. It is difficult to comprehend the continuing scale of
loss of our architectural heritage unless you are daily being asked to buy
or rescue it,' said Kay.
Today Kay, 43, does little buying or selling. But rescuing items of
architectural merit is his life's mission. In the 1970s, he was one of the
pioneers of the movement to salvage old building materials, and for 14 years
was a partner in a large Bath-based architectural antiques business.
Now he confines his activities to the two-person enterprise he calls Salvo]
As a publisher, a polemicist and a publicist for the recycling of old
building materials he works a minimum 80-hour week, which usually includes
an all-night session at his desktop publishing system.
Kay and Matravers produce a weekly bulletin called SalvoNews, a monthly,
Salvo, which takes an in-depth look at the world of architectural antiques
and reclaimed building materials, and an annual Salvo directory, which sells
to architects, conservation officers, designers and home handymen.
It is an exhausting exercise. Kay is frequently away researching and writing
articles in Scotland, Ireland and occasionally in Europe, all of which
feature in his publications. Matravers mans the phone, deals with
advertisers, scans numerous publications for news items for the publications
and looks after Sophie, the couple's three-year-old daughter. And it all
takes place from the couple's sparsely-furnished, two-bedroomed top-floor
flat in a listed Georgian terrace in the heart of Bath.
The Salvo directory, now in its second edition, sells at Pounds 5 and Kay
and Matravers make a gross profit of Pounds 3.75 on each. This year they
printed 5,000 and so far 3,500 have been sold, including 200 on the Salvo
stand at an exhibition in London's Olympia.
The subscription for the Salvo weekly and monthly is Pounds 50 a year, or
Pounds 20 for the monthly alone. Kay will not divulge the circulations which
he describes as 'very small'. 'However we mail to five countries and the
following seems to be growing,' he said.
'One of the problems is that architects are used to getting something for
nothing. It is hard attracting regular subscribers, so the number we print
each month varies, depending on whom we choose to send it to. Salvo monthly
is not likely to become a news-stand publication, but, given time, it has a
lot going for it. It covers many conservation issues and is the only real
alternative building magazine.
'We do not actively sell advertising space. We feel it would detract from
what we are trying to do,' Matravers said. 'But the advertising has grown
because people send us advertisements with cheques up front, and it is
growing.'
Kay's hope is that eventually all the 2,000 architectural antiques
businesses listed in the directory will pay for an entry. Enterprises listed
include ones in Jersey, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy, and a
handful in Australia. The directory also includes articles on leading
conservation organisations and a free listing of architectural thefts.
'Our objective is for around 5 per cent of building materials to be
reclaimed,' he said. 'At present in the UK the figure is less than 1 per
cent. If we could hit the 5 per cent figure I reckon it would create 50,000
permanent low-skilled jobs and 50,000 permanent jobs in highly-skilled
restoration work. This would be in addition to saving millions of perfectly
good bricks and countless miles of good quality pine flooring that is thrown
away daily.' In its first year Salvo made a loss of Pounds 3,000, in spite
of sales of Pounds 9,100 on the directory and SalvoNews. In its second year
the loss was reduced to Pounds 400, but Kay does not believe the company
will move into profit with the publication of the third edition of the Salvo
directory at the end of this year.
He and Matravers are living on savings. Kay is against borrowing, except for
a Pounds 50,000 mortgage on the flat. He has yet to take any money out of
Salvo and Matravers draws Pounds 3,200 a year, all of which goes on daytime
care for Sophie.
'The way things are going I'll probably drop dead after SalvoNews number
100,' Kay said. 'That gives me 19 issues to go. At that stage, if I'm still
alive, I shall have to take on some other work, or reduce the amount of
effort going into Salvo.
'But really I am confident we are doing the right thing - that somehow Salvo
will provide a living - even though at present I don't quite know how.' He
is working on an image database aimed at providing information to
architects, design and build companies and other interested parties on
buildings about to be demolished.
Kay added: 'If Salvo is successful in this we could become the Reuters, as
well as the unofficial mouthpiece, of the reclaimed building materials
industry.
'But to achieve this we need help. We need a philanthropist to back us
because we are not going to make any money in the foreseeable future.'

FT  11 JUN 94 / Property: A snip at Pounds 25m - in Chelsea - Cadogan's
Place
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Yours, reader, for Pounds 25m. That is the guide price for the Old Rectory
(56 Old Church Street) in Chelsea, London SW3, now coming to market. No
other house for sale in London matches this private palace in its own garden
of more than two acres.
A 1725 building with later additions, it had been sold by the Diocese of
London for redevelopment, but this only came to fruition when the property
was bought in 1990 by developer TMC, under its Japanese chairman Norikazu
Nemoto. Anthony Collett, managing director of TMC, and Andrzej Zarycki, both
architects, prepared new plans which needed listed building consent, and
which tripled the size of the house.
A classical treat is the result. I particularly liked the tall pavilion-like
drawing room, belle epoque at its most belle. Windows down to the floor lead
into the garden and across to a columned conservatory that houses a swimming
pool that recalls the emperor Hadrian's villa near Tivoli.
Detailing is immaculate, from the parquet floors to the cedar of Lebanon in
the clothes cupboards (to deter moths and make the clothes smell nice). An
oculus-window in the gym looks into the pool. The kitchen is of burnished
steel, and the machines in the basement are a handyman's heaven. The garden
even has a borehole and irrigation.
The agent is Knight Frank &amp; Rutley (071-629 8171). The house is for sale
leasehold, with 113 years to run, and a ground rent of Pounds 500 which
qualifies a private buyer to enfranchise the property (acquire the
freehold). Otherwise, the Old Rectory will revert to the Church of England's
London Diocesan Fund in the 22nd century.
*****
Elsewhere in the housing market, Nationwide building society reports a
slight rise in property prices in May and Halifax a slight fall. New
mortgages were down in April from March, as were both agreed sales and
completed sales as monitored by the Corporate Estate Agents Property Index.
Yolande Barnes, of Savills Residential Research, who in December forecast a
25 per cent rise in prime central London property by the end of 1994 - and
19 per cent elsewhere - says building society figures tend to reflect the
cheaper end of the market.
In the first quarter of the year prime values rose by 5 per cent in central
London and this has rippled on to outer London and the home counties. There
are no similar increases elsewhere in the UK and some asking prices are
still coming down.
*****
Around 6,000 buildings have a Grade I listing, which puts their owners in a
good position to receive English Heritage or local authority grants. Six
Grade I houses on sale are:
The Abbey at Swaffham Bulbeck near Newmarket, a Georgian house built over a
medieval undercroft from the previous Benedictine nunnery, for around Pounds
350,000 from Redmayne Arnold &amp; Harris (0223-323130).
Bishops Court near Exeter, now Victorian High Gothic, but once the main
country residence of the Bishops of Exeter, Pounds 1.2m for four lots from
Jackson-Stops (0392-214222).
The 17th/18th century Callaly Castle in Northumberland on the border with
Scotland, where the Library House is a four-bedroom unit, for offers over
Pounds 200,000 from John Sale (0289- 306411).
Hardham Priory near Pulborough in West Sussex, which includes a 13th century
chapter house (also Grade I), on the market for the first time in 130 years,
for offers over Pounds 500,000 from Burford Jordan (0903-742535) or Strutt &amp;
Parker (0273-475411).
The Old Manor at Kingston Maurward near Dorchester, a sturdy E-plan house
built in 1591, for around Pounds 500,000 from Jackson-Stops (0305-262123) or
Michael de Pelet in association with Knight Frank &amp; Rutley (0935-812 236).
Poundisford Park near Taunton, a Tudor house in 67 acres with an avenue of
trees in the park, for offers over Pounds 600,000 from Strutt &amp; Parker
(0392-215 631).
A Grade I house that Knight Frank &amp; Rutley sold recently, with a guide price
in excess of Pounds 1.45m, is: The Pavilion at Hampton Court, the only one
to survive of four pavilions that Wren built for William III in 1700. They
were originally small banqueting houses - or places for a discreet
rendezvous.
*****
Merton College, Oxford, is selling the 1,2080-acre Radstone estate near
Brackley in Northamptonshire, which it bought in 1868. Interest has been
intense. Agent Cluttons (0865-246 611), requesting best offers by June 22,
has despatched more than 400 particulars.
Estates bursar Robert Hodgson says that Merton, now more than 700 years old,
will still own 14,000 acres.
The guide prices is Pounds 2.46m. A possible bonne bouche for a churchgoing
purchaser of the estate, is the chance to receive the advowson, the right to
present the rector. As a Merton man, I hope that the best price is realised.

FT  11 JUN 94 / Property: Life on the open water - Considering living
afloat? James Fisher looks at London's range of moorings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Life on the open water is an attractive and romantic notion - and there are
places in London where it can be achieved. Splice the mainbrace, cast off,
catch the tide and sail off into the sunset.
Well, not quite: most houseboats no longer have engines, and the emphasis is
definitely on the 'house' rather than the 'boat' - although the latter is
needed to keep it afloat.
There are roughly 200 moorings for houseboats on the tidal river, usually in
small enclaves at places such as Chiswick, Twickenham, Isleworth and Kew.
The largest of these is also the most familiar - off Cheyne Walk, in
Chelsea, there are 58 moorings. Boats are often sold privately, by word of
mouth or through specialist publications. The market is thus fairly
restricted.
Ship brokers are more likely than estate agents to act for vendors. However,
the Chelsea Yacht &amp; Boat Company, which owns and maintains the Cheyne Walk
moorings, sells through estate agents Browett Taylor &amp; Co.
There are up to half-a-dozen houseboats for sale at any one time in this
narrow market.
Michael Woolf, a partner at Browett Taylor, estimates that two or three are
sold at Cheyne Walk every year. Woolf reckons that houseboats traditionally
perform ahead of inflation, but they did not achieve the same dramatic price
rises as properties on dry land. Equally, they have not been so adversely
affected by the recession. Prices range from Pounds 60,000 to Pounds
200,000.
The larger houseboats, 85ft long or more, are spacious, well-appointed craft
with three or four cabins, reception and dining room, kitchen and bathrooms.
On the larger boats, a master cabin and a double bedroom with shower room
are usually found aft. In the forward section there are often three
bedrooms, a bathroom, reception room and kitchen/dining space.
Currently, Browett's has the boat Broedertrouw II on the market at Pounds
75,000. Maintenance charges cost about Pounds 20 per foot per year. For
this, the Chelsea Yacht &amp; Boat Company provides all the mains services,
along with mail facilities, refuse collection and general maintenance of
pontoons and moorings. The company will also carry out repairs.
To live in a houseboat, you need a mooring licence, which can be bought
annually, subject to agreement, or for nine years at Pounds 100 per foot, or
18 years at Pounds 150 per foot.
And there are other overheads to take into account. The Chelsea Yacht &amp; Boat
Company requires each boat to have a full marine survey in a dry dock every
three years.
Like any other domestic property, houseboats are subject to council tax, and
are banded according to value. However, unlike other domestic property, it
is not always possible to raise a mortgage on a houseboat.
If the right property cannot be found in the chosen location, new moorings
can be established. The Port of London Authority will usually grant
permission for moorings in suitable sites.
However, in the main, local authorities are not co-operative and,
unfortunately, they hold sway over the River Works Licence, which is
required to institute a development.
The London Tideway Harbour Company is actively seeking locations for more
moorings, but progress is slow, and success has been limited. British
Waterways, the government agency, owns the water, and manages the sites for
canals in and around London, including Little Venice.
Pat Murray, customer services manager for British Waterways, was not
prepared to talk about prices or fees, insisting that this was a private
matter, but did say that there was a waiting list for moorings managed by
the agency.

FT  11 JUN 94 / Motoring: Seat Cordoba
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The new Seat Cordoba (above) - a booted, four-door saloon version of the
Toledo hatchback - is in British showrooms now at fiercely competitive
prices. It starts at Pounds 9,095 for the 1.6 CLX (pictured) and goes up to
Pounds 12,595 for the 2.0 GT E, which has anti-lock brakes and electronic
traction control.
Other models are a 1.8-litre GLX (Pounds 10,895), 2.0 GT (Pounds 11,995),
and two diesels: the 1.9 D CLX (Pounds 9,395) and the 1.9 turbo-diesel GLX
(Pounds 11,195).
Every Cordoba has power steering, a glass tilt/slide sun-roof, 60:40 split
rear seat, six-speaker RDS radio, and tinted glass all round. A driver-side
air bag is a Pounds 350 optional extra.
The boot is enormous: a little bigger even than that of a Ford Granada and
much larger than a Bentley Turbo R. Its volume is 16.1 cubic feet (456
litres) with seats up, extending to 27 cu ft (765 litres) when seats are
folded forward.
Seat is owned by Volkswagen and the Cordoba's engines, five-speed gearboxes,
and many of the other mechanical components under its Spanish-styled body
are what you would find in VW Golfs. In length (13 feet 6 inches/4.109
metres), it falls between the Golf hatchback (13ft 2in/4.02m) and its saloon
version, the Vento (14ft 4in/4.38m).
The Cordoba passed all Volkswagen's safety tests, most of which are carried
out at higher speeds than the 30mph (50kph) demanded by EU regulations.
Clearly, the British insurance industry was impressed, because its ratings
(from group seven for 1.6 CLX and 1.9 D CLX to group 11 for the 2.0 GT) are
below those of its competitors.
Average fuel consumptions should range from about 46 miles per gallon (6.14
l/100 km) for the turbo-diesel to 35mpg (8.07 l/100 km) for the 2.0 GT.
Seat's value for money has been recognised by the Automobile Association. It
now runs a fleet of 130 Toledos, most of them diesels or turbo-diesels.

FT  11 JUN 94 / Gardening: Miracles on view at visiting time
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Whatever the state of your own garden, you can now go and visit someone
else's. This weekend and the next three, thousands of gardeners will
circulate between each other on the roads of England and Wales; four golden
weekends of garden-watching stretch ahead, helping to take the strain off
weekend guests, in-laws and, with luck, the dog.
There are more than 3,500 possible visits, most of which are listed in the
National Garden Scheme's indispensable yellow book. Priced at Pounds 3, this
year's edition is in the shops and belongs on every car dashboard - your
guide to other people's miracles and muddles, some excellent teas and, last
year, a contribution to charity which reached Pounds 1.5m.
Although most of us keep our houses firmly shut, we open gardens. The
Englishman's home is still a castle but the Englishwoman's rose garden
strives to be shown off on Sundays to anyone who will pay Pounds 2. It even
seems to be selfish nowadays to keep a garden secret; people behave as if
your hard work was also their heritage and the question is when can we come,
not whether.
Visiting raises our ideas of the possible; until you have seen the best, you
cannot set your own standards. It is also a test of the visitors, quite
apart from the rascals who steal plants.
Ever more visitors are shoppers, looking piecemeal with themselves in mind.
What is it, where do I buy it, where can we put it, why cannot we have a
laburnum walk?
Self-centred visiting is not very restful and obscures the whole for the
sake of the details. It is not the best way of improving your own design.
Remember that other people's soils and sites are not yours and that some of
the best gardens are those which you cannot imitate.
Even if you dislike them, ask yourself how you would have done it
differently in the particular setting; experiments widen our range and stop
a visit from being a waste of time. The mistake is to travel around
intending to copy and transplant every good idea on to your own site,
whether or not it belongs there.
Which of all those gardens are on my short list for mid-summer visiting? Of
those operated by the National Trust, the tops have to be Powis Castle on
the Welsh borders, at its best in late July; and Sissinghurst in Kent, at
its best in the rose season of late June.
The weather is still playing marvellous havoc with past planning and
groupings of colour. The sequence of mild winters and unusual summers
continues to bring out flowers at unexpected moments; this year's climbing
roses began early, whereas the peonies have held back and the catmint has
jumped ahead by a fortnight. If a garden's borders look unbalanced, blame
the season.
Everyone knows their own area best, but I would begin with advice for the
north and south-west. The huge gardens at Newby Hall, near Ripon, are worth
anyone's money on their daily openings (except Mondays).
In Somerset, the wonderful sight of Hadspen, near Castle Cary, has continued
to be upgraded with particular magic in the last five years; it is open from
Thursday to Sunday and could be combined on July 2 and 3 with Kingsdon, near
Somerton, another mecca for plant-lovers with a tantalising nursery.
Between north and south, I see most clearly as far west as the area around
Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire. The Priory, Kemerton, is open tomorrow and
every Thursday until late September, whereas the Old Manor House at Twyning
is open on Monday afternoons, not Sundays, throughout the flowering year.
The Priory raises all our ideas of colour and grouping in a long border; the
Old Manor combines the skills of a great grower of small, hardy plants with
walls, fruit trees and an artistic eye.
Gardens which have run in families have the particular attraction of
maturity and continuity. Two of my favourites are Hodges Barn, Shipton
Moyne, Gloucestershire which Mr and Mrs CN Hornby are opening on Mondays,
Tuesdays and Thursdays with a special Sunday on July 3.
On the way, you can combine it with the glorious garden at Kiftsgate Court,
just below Hidcote near Chipping Camden. It is now in its third generation
of family management, female-driven, and right at the top of my personal
sources of pleasure and understanding.
Other gardens are ageing with their famous owners and need special attention
because time might be running out.
Tomorrow is your chance to see the backbone and plantings at Haseley Court,
in south Oxfordshire, made famous by Mrs CG Lancaster for a generation of
gardeners since the 1960s.
I would also use the last Wednesday in June to visit the fine garden at the
Old Rectory, Burghfield, near Reading. Its sense of style and formal
informality have changed the horizons of so many of us. On June 12 and 22,
you can prepare at Towersey Manor, Oxfordshire, where wonders have been
worked since 1974 on clay and a flat site.
On June 26, another Old Rectory at Farnborough, on the Berkshire downs, will
be showing off the roses, deutzias and clematis under Mrs Michael
Todd-Hunter's artistic management.
Tomorrow and on July 3, connoisseurs will have marked down the Old Rectory
Cottage, Tidmarsh, also in Berkshire, where Mr and Mrs AWA Baker have
collected, raised and grown such a fascinating range of unfamiliar hardy
plants.
When rectors leave rectories, gardeners move in and resurrect them. Off the
Old Rectory circuit, there is plenty to see in the manors and main houses of
Hampshire and Sussex villages.
On June 19, Bramdean House, near Alresford off the A272 in Hampshire, is
open. Nearby Hinton Ampner House, now under the National Trust's management,
is another favourite and is opening specially on Sunday June 26. Further
south at Boldre, near Lymington, Peter Chappell's garden and nursery at
Spinners open Wednesday through Sunday from July 1 onwards and remain an
important source of unusual and desirable plants.
Christopher Lloyd is one of the few gardening writers to risk visits from
his public and Great Dixter, at Northiam in East Sussex, is open
particularly on Sundays in July and August for charity.
From 40-acre parks to town gardens as small as Mrs A. Dexter's masterpiece
at 23 Beech Croft Road in Oxford (open only by appointment), there are sites
of all scales and styles which confirm that at least a fraction of the
British really are gardeners in the way the rest of the world pre-supposes.
Go and look - but do not go only to imitate.

FT  11 JUN 94 / Outdoors: Ferrari's need to win - A look at the profile of a
legendary company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN JACQUES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is a magic about Ferrari. Although the company only races 16 times a
season, and makes a paltry 3,000 road cars annually, virtually everyone has
heard of it. It is estimated that one-third of the spectators who attend
grand prix come just to watch the red cars bearing the prancing horse
emblem. In Italy, Ferrari is one of the few sources of national identity.
British teams such as Williams and McLaren have enjoyed far more success
than Ferrari over the last decade but they have failed to stir the emotions
of the public - this has been left to the drivers, notably Nigel Mansell.
In Italy it is the other way round. The fans, the famous tifosi, go in their
tens of thousands to watch their beloved Ferrari: support for Italian
drivers is an afterthought.
Two years ago at the San Marino Grand Prix, held at Imola, not too far from
the Ferrari factory at Maranello, both Ferraris retired soon after the
start. The tifosi, for whom the race had simply lost its point, immediately
left in droves, leaving great empty spaces around the track.
Ferrari worship is, not surprisingly, at its most devout at Maranello, a
small nondescript town of 15,000 near Bologna, the heart of red Italy. When
the new Ferrari Formula One car made its first appearance in February at the
team's test circuit next to the factory, more than 1,000 people turned up to
watch.
The magic of Ferrari is the product of many ingredients. Ferrari is the only
team to have entered every grand prix since the world championship was
inaugurated in 1950 and for many years it has been the only team which has
made both the car and the engine. And unlike every other team, Ferrari has
resisted the demands of the sponsors and insisted on its cars being painted
red.
Up until the early 1970s, Ferrari entered sports car events as well as grand
prix, winning at Le Mans many times, and until McLaren's recent involvement,
Ferrari was the only team to make production cars as well as racing cars.
Enzo Ferrari, the larger than life founder of the firm who died in 1988, was
one of the most famous men in Italy, receiving visits from both the Pope and
the Italian president.
The explanation for the magic of the Prancing Horse is not Ferrari's record
on the track. It is true that, until last season when it was passed by
McLaren, Ferrari had won more grand prix than any other team. But that is
hardly surprising as it has entered far more than anyone else.
But since the centre of gravity of the international motor racing industry
began to shift to the UK at the end of the 1950s, Ferrari victories have
been the exception rather than the rule. The team has not won the world
drivers' championship since 1979 and its last grand prix victory was nearly
four years ago.
Britain's rise as the centre of the motor racing community reflected a
deeper shift in the nature of the industry. Motor racing had always been a
child of the car industry, with the engine regarded as the heart of any
racing car. This remains the Italian tradition.
But from the early 1960s, the influence of the motor industry was replaced
by aerospace, the engine by aerodynamics and roadholding. With the
precipitous decline of a large domestic aerospace industry, the fledgling UK
racing companies were well-placed to take advantage of the new synergy: a
sophisticated and increasingly international motor racing intelligentsia
took root around the M25 corridor around London.
Ferrari had no such luck. There was little in the way of an Italian aircraft
industry. Ferrari remained rooted in a mechanical culture, assimilating
rather than pioneering the latest innovations.
When the engines were placed behind rather than in front of the drivers,
Ferrari was one of the last to follow suit. When carbon fibre became de
rigueur for the construction of the monocoque, Ferrari was obliged in 1981
to appoint a British designer, Harvey Postlethwaite, to introduce the new
technology.
Even now, when it is clear that the best configuration for a grand prix
engine is probably a V10, Ferrari, for reasons of tradition and sentiment,
is sticking steadfastly to its beloved V12.
Ferrari's fierce sense of tradition has been a formidable handicap in the
way of its adaptation to the demands of an enormously competitive and
innovative industry. An obvious example is Ferrari's commitment to make both
car and engine. The last team to do this was Renault in the early 1980s. It
never won the world championship. The technical, logistical and financial
strains of doing both are huge.
Whatever the disadvantages though, it is impossible to conceive of a Ferrari
without a Ferrari engine. As Giancarlo Baccini, Ferrari's press chief put
it: 'The engine is where the Ferrari heart beats.'
Tradition is also a mixed blessing when it comes to the Ferrari workforce.
There has been a long history of employing non-Italians, notably British. It
started with Ferrari drivers in the 1950s and slowly spread into the
technical areas.
Postlethwaite's appointment in 1981 was an important moment, as was John
Barnard's as technical director in 1988. They represented a grudging and
belated recognition by Ferrari that the epicentre of motor racing lay
elsewhere.
Nonetheless, the team and its methods remained thoroughly Italian. The
opportunity provided by Barnard's appointment - the best designer in Formula
One - was ultimately squandered by poor management, and he left.
Ferrari's difficulties were compounded by the death of Enzo Ferrari in 1988.
Some thought that without the quirks and idiosyncracies of the commendatore,
Ferrari could be reborn.
But all modern racing teams require a highly skilled, compact and mobile
workforce exercising autonomy and initiative - the classic flat structure -
combined with a strong figure who provides leadership, focus and discipline.
Ron Dennis at McLaren and Frank Williams at Williams are the outstanding
examples.
With the death of Enzo Ferrari, Fiat acquired 90 per cent control of Ferrari
and the team began to lose both direction and personality. After a couple of
relatively successful seasons with Barnard as designer, the team went to
pot.
Slowly, however, Ferrari has been putting together a new team. At its head
is Luca di Montezemolo, who was in charge of the Ferrari racing team during
the 1970s, when Niki Lauda won two world championships for them.
Last July, the Frenchman Jean Todt, who had previously been the successful
director of Peugeot Sport, was appointed to head the racing team. Todt, a
small man, slightly overweight and with a face a bit like a pumpkin, is
under no illusions about the task he faces. He intones that there are no
short-term solutions.
When asked why Ferrari had failed to deliver the goods, he replied: 'There
was a lack of professionalism, an underestimation of what was needed to
succeed in Formula One in the present era, a tendency to be too short-term.'
Todt is the first non-Italian to head the Ferrari team, a brave decision. He
is joined by Englishman John Barnard, the awkward genius who pioneered the
use of carbon fibre and semi-automatic gearbox and the most important
designer in F1 since Colin Chapman at Lotus, back again as chief designer
and based in Shalford, Surrey, where all Ferrari's design work on the car is
now done.
A few months ago, Ferrari also appointed the Japanese engineer Osamu Goto,
who was responsible for the all-conquering Honda V10 of the late 1980s, to
take responsibility for research and development in the engine department.
And an Austrian, Gustav Brunner, now occupies a senior position on the car
side.
Ferrari, that most Italian of institutions, has gone international. Todt
admitted that in the past Ferrari had been 'too nationally minded'. 'The
English teams,' he added, 'are no good at speaking foreign languages, but
they are very good at using foreigners and their expertise.'
Ferrari is attempting to join them. But whether its international team can
be blended to produce success is another matter. Todt recognises that there
can be no overnight miracle. 'This season, I just want to win a race,' he
said.
Ferrari's latest F1 car, a work of great beauty and the most advanced on the
starting grid - as befits a Barnard creation - could certainly do that.

FT  11 JUN 94 / Motoring: How to deal with a dirty dog
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dripping labradors and golf bags attached to trolleys have one thing in
common; they are not car-friendly. When we had a much loved black labrador,
she travelled in the back of the family Renault 4, separated from the metal
floor by a couple of flour sacks.
Labradors cannot stay out of scummy ponds and are prone to roll in
unmentionable things. After months of wondering about the source of the
over-ripe pong, I realised it was the sacks.
When I threw them out the car smelled sweeter and, from then on, the dog
travelled on old towels and bits of blanket that were thrown out as they
became too gamey.
There is now a much better option; a Quiltie from a small company in
Oxfordshire called Over The Top Textiles (tel: 0608-676625). This is a
triple-layered fabric mat with a non-slip base that stops dogs from sliding
around when they leap aboard or if the car is cornered too quickly.
The top layer, which looks like tweed, is non-absorbent. The essence of wet
dog passes through to the absorbent wadding that is the meat in the Quiltie
sandwich. As the mud on the top layer turns to dust, it can be vacuumed
away. In any case, the whole thing is machine washable.
Quilties come in standard sizes or are tailored to particular cars. My
daughter's two labradors now travel in style on one fitted to the load space
of what has become a surprisingly fragrant Citroen XM estate. Prices range
from Pounds 63.95 (tailored to estates and 4x4s) or Pounds 13.95 upward in
standard sizes. Curtains to protect load space sides are also available.
Two sets of golf clubs in trolleys are almost as awkward as a bicycle to fit
into cars. Even in those with as much apparent space as a Range Rover, they
leave little room for holiday luggage, which overflows on to the back seats.
Two-up, that is no problem. But when four people are travelling, the best
solution is a moulded plastic roof box. This motoring equivalent of a home
extension fixes on a pair of bars - or, better still, the cross members of
an estate car's roof rack.
Halfords has a wide range costing between Pounds 180 to Pounds 420
(including roof bars and fitting kit). A Pounds 249.97 Swedish-made Thule
box I tried looked neat atop a Citroen Xantia, held two golf bags and
trolleys plus several soft bags, and had little effect on fuel consumption
at moderate speeds.
It proved watertight in a downpour. The main snags are that, with the box
on, a sun-roof becomes pointless. And even when the box is removed, the
supporting bars create quite a lot of wind noise.

FT  11 JUN 94 / Sport: Sailing is the life of Riley - Yachting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEITH WHEATLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Here is a prediction. Dawn Riley will do for women in sailing what Nick
Faldo has done for British golf.
This brawny, humorous American blonde skippering an all-woman crew has just
brought a clapped-out W60 named Heineken home 8th in the Whitbread
round-the-world race. No big deal, you might say. Women first did the race
four years ago on Maiden (where Riley, 29, was a watch leader under skipper
Tracy Edwards). Eighth is hardly world-shaking. Only the
technically-deficient Russian and Ukrainian boats finished behind Heineken.
More to the point was the inspirational style of Riley's leadership under
testing circumstances. Heineken was the first W60 built and it had too many
miles on the clock even before leaving. During the race, sails ripped so
often that the crew renamed themselves the Sewing Circle. The most recent
mishap left them drifting rudder-less in a force 9 gale west of the Scilly
Isles.
Riley's despatch from last Monday read: 'It took a minute before we could
see that the shaft between the rudder and the tiller was broken at the
bottom weld.' She tried to fix it by going over the side into the big seas
with a small electric drill.
'Our drill wasn't up to the task,' she continued. 'I then spent 1 1/2 hours
in the water tying ropes to the rudder blade so we could steer it. We're now
doing five knots but I'm not sure it will hold for long.'
Four hundred miles from the finish at Southampton, there were other
problems. 'We need to get (there) soon because we have enough propane gas
for one more meal.
'Looking on the bright side, we'll all be skinny when we get to Ocean
Village (the race base).'
Riley's own future looks even brighter. When she returns to the US, she will
join the all-women crew who will race America3, the defending champion, in
next year's America's Cup trials. It will be the first all-female crew in
the cup's long history but sponsor Bill Koch, a mid-west billionaire, is
confident about their chances.
'We are not sending a bunch of bunny girls out there to look good,' said
Koch who, during the 1992 cup races, turned himself from a rabbit helmsman
into a class act. 'These women are great sailors and really determined
people.'
Some 650 women applied to join the cup programme for 1995 and 23 have been
chosen already. The smart money says Riley will soon be named as America3's
skipper.
Her first piece of good fortune was to be raised in Detroit, Michigan,
rather than on the east coast where a woman's role on a boat is to gaze
admiringly at her Ivy League husband. They do things differently in the home
of Henry Ford and Tamla Motown.
Her fiance is New Zealand sailor Barry McKay, who was on the catamaran Enza
when it set a 75-day round-the-world record earlier this year.
Riley has sailed since her schooldays, honing her skills in the tricky winds
and waves of America's Great Lakes. At 13, she took a year off school to
sail with her parents on their 36ft cutter around the east coast of the
Caribbean.
When she joined Maiden five years ago, it was a turning point for Riley and
women sailors. The Maiden campaign had to punch through both the strength
barrier and the notion that women did not have the stamina, drive and skills
to tackle the 32,000 gruelling miles of the Whitbread. And it did so
famously, winning two of the six legs in its class, triumphing in the media,
and was greeted on returning to Southampton by cheering, flag-waving
supporters.
Heineken's welcome early on Thursday was more subdued. But unlike Edwards,
Riley is not heading for the Welsh hills to breed horses. The best of her
racing is yet to come.

FT  11 JUN 94 / Sport: Keen Kiwis look to the future - Cricket
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERESA MCLEAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The globe may be warming, but this year's English cricketing summer has
settled for erratic rain and winds to unsettle the visiting New Zealanders.
By the time the tourists reached Trent Bridge, they were upset, not just by
the wet and cold but, also by the bewildering speed with which wet and dry,
cold and hot were succeeding each other this summer.
At Chelmsford, before the Trent Bridge Test, New Zealand rejoiced in a rare
chance to try out for their players, although only the last day in Essex
brought out ice-creams and New Zealand flags, to celebrate a good practice
and a draw.
Watching Matthew Hart bat with distinction at number nine, one of several
young tourists who can bat as well as bowl - Shane Thomson is another - it
seemed as if New Zealand had almost too many of the all-rounders England are
always seeking.
New Zealand suits all-rounders and Sir Richard Hadlee is their national
hero. He is pleased with the individual confidence of Hart and Thomson and
also of wicket-keeper Adam Parore, who bats beautifully, with occasional
lapses into one-day swiping.
New Zealand's hope for the future is that this team will be able to come
back in a few years with their skills refined and beat those who are giving
them a hard time now. The key question is: can they do it?
Matthew Hart reckons all he has to do is go on improving - as he has done
since he was in England last with a representative side, in 1992. He was
only 20 then and flourishing in a hot, humid summer. The weather is less
friendly this time and, as he glared grimly at the rain clouds, he said:
'It's easier to stay fit in warm weather. This cold and wet weather makes
people break down.'
An eye for the elements has led Hart into his present role as a bowler of
slow, flighted balls, including leg spinners, an old-fashioned kind of
bowling, good fun to watch.
He started his cricket as a batsman, which is easy to believe, then shifted
the emphasis to bowling because he found it easy to get people out with his
seamers.
So why leg spin? 'Injuries,' was his reply. 'When I was about 15 I changed
from seamers to spin because I got fed up with pulling muscles and injuring
things all the time.' A sentiment that will be welcomed by cricket lovers,
who seem to be presented with a barrage of injuries as soon as bowlers start
bowling.
While I was talking to Hart, Chris Pringle, who did well with his seamers at
Edgbaston, burst in and declared that his reason for bowling fast-medium was
the back-yard challenge of it all. He was looking for the physiotherapist at
the time, but when I asked him how his strained back was, he said he was not
giving anything away.
Injuries have joined weather as strategic weapons. Newspaper speculation
helps produce that attitude. 'In New Zealand the papers report matches,'
said Hart, very much the child from far away. 'Here they sensationalise
things, not least injuries. And they put great pressure on individual
players, like Craig White. How can he play his normal game when he's had
such a lot of build-up about coming into Test cricket?'
White's cause is helped by the miserable time Darren Gough is having with
his pre-Test side strain. Next, we know, there will be a side-strain society
for bowlers, crossing the barriers of race and pace. White and Gough will
have to learn early to be players with reserves of calm in the face of media
pressure.
Knowing their selection is for at least a season, not a single game as in
the do-or-die style of the previous regime, would surely be a help. Danny
Morrison has been New Zealand's main strike bowler since Hadlee's
retirement. At 28 he is a veritable antique and, indeed, he limped off the
field at Edgbaston, in pain from a groin strain. Groin strains are a
recurring menace to faster bowlers involved in long stints of bowling, but
Morrison hopes to be fit by the Lord's Test, bringing with him stability and
experience.
It is a difficult problem for New Zealand. The worst mistake would be to
bring Morrison back too soon, aggravating the injury and depressing Heath
Davis, the big, enthusiastic young risk in this New Zealand party. He was
nicely described in the official programme for the one-day game that never
happened at Lord's on May 21 as one of the visitors' 'Young Guns . . . the
trouble is that he is never sure where the bullets are going.'
There will be time for target practice because Davis is only 23 and
extremely keen. Last summer he played for Sussex Second XI; last winter he
took lots of wickets in New Zealand. If he can do well again this winter, it
will raise his morale. At least he has some speed, which is what England's
would-be pace bowlers constantly seek.
At Chelmsford I watched Essex's new signing from the outback, Michael
Kasprowicz, bowling far too loosely in an attempt to bowl more speedily.
This was just what Devon Malcolm did at Trent Bridge, when a few yorkers
would have been much more efficient.
Short bowling at tail-enders is not often worth it; against experienced
batsmen such as Martin Crowe it is a waste of time. The New Zealanders are
better than the English at knowing their limitations and playing
accordingly.
This important cricketing skill needs nourishing in their new young batting
star, Stephen Fleming. He is a stylish left-hander, particularly strong on
the leg side, but at only 21 years old he may soon get tired of being
compared to Crowe. His height sometimes rescues him from the comparison by
giving the impression that he is too big for the crease. He uses a crouched
stance but I reckon that increases the risk of lbw. However, he did well in
getting 54 in the first innings at Trent Bridge and I look forward to
watching him again.
Fleming is one of many young players on this tour who will go back with his
cricket enriched, if captain Ken Rutherford can keep up spirits.
Looking for Hart, I walked straight past a doorman at the Chelmsford
pavilion, but when I reached the balcony I was stopped while someone went to
get Rutherford and Crowe. When I said it was Hart I wanted, there was
general amusement, especially on the part of Crowe, but he was glad to be
spared another interview.
Rutherford was already at one, while everyone waited for the rain to fade.
They are the leading lights of a friendly team with its focus on the future,
made up largely of young players, such as Hart and Fleming, who have not yet
learnt to be world-weary.
It is a pleasant change to see umpires give decisions in good humour,
exchanging smiles with New Zealanders who are not exciting but are working
sensibly and cheerfully.
Some of South Africa's young batsmen, by contrast, are said to be very
exciting and they have novelty value on their side. Or perhaps one should
say refreshment; South Africa have not been in England since the abandoned
tour of 1968. Either way, I am sure it is good for cricket to have South
Africa back on the international circuit. Apart from all the worthier
reasons, it makes a change.

FT  11 JUN 94 / Sport: In pursuit of perfection - Golf
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEREK LAWRENSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
You would have thought that Jose-Maria Olazabal would have been happy with
his lot after reducing one of Britain's most difficult tests of golf to just
65 shots to win the recent Volvo PGA Championship at Wentworth. He was not.
The Masters champion had said before the event that he was struggling with
his swing and nothing had happened over the 72 holes to persuade him to
change his mind.
Golfers are notorious perfectionists, rarely acknowledging that everything
has gone right.
Colin Montgomerie tells of the lengths to which the perfectionists will go.
He was partnering Bernhard Langer in a foursomes match in the 1991 Ryder
Cup, and the Scot's drive had finished in the middle of the fairway. 'How
far to the flag?' Langer had asked Montgomerie. 'It is 172 yards from the
sprinkler head,' he replied, to which Langer said, in all seriousness: 'Is
that measurement from the front of the sprinkler head or the back?'
Perhaps the most public acknowledgement of perfection came in the 1980 Open
at Royal Lytham and St Annes when the winner Severiano Ballesteros, shot 65
in the final round to win by a stroke from Nick Price. 'Only once every 25
or 30 years does a player get to play that well,' Ballesteros said
afterwards, and much of his form since has borne out that statement.
There are, however, two rounds of golf broadly considered to be on the
highest plane. Both were played in major championships and both were played
on courses that will be hosting majors this year. One was Greg Norman's 63
at Turnberry in the 1986 Open, which is where the event will return next
month. The other was Johnny Miller's 63 in the final round of the 1973 US
Open at Oakmont, which will host next week's US Open.
Oakmont is a typical US Open course - and then some. The fairways are
narrow, the rough is long and the greens are small and ridiculously quick.
'Three putting isn't a possibility there, it's an achievement,' one player
wryly recalled.
Oakmont is made for perfectionists, because if it is so hard on the players
then it follows that it must suit those who are most hard on themselves.
This year, the United States Golf Association has finally recognised that
the world is a large place, and there will be 16 Europeans taking part.
Contrast that with the miserly half dozen who received invitations as
recently as five years ago.
Nobody from Europe has won this title since Tony Jacklin crossed the
Atlantic as the sole representative from the continent in 1970 and completed
a rare double, the Open and the US Open in a 12-month span.
If a European is to win this year, it will be a familiar name: look to
Langer, Olazabal, Montgomerie, but most of all to Nick Faldo, who now
regards this championship as his number one priority.
He is at Oakmont already: most of the players will not arrive there until
Tuesday, five days later. But a perfectionist can never be too early.

FT  11 JUN 94 / Sport: A surprise for the wildlife - FT Ski Expedition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARNIE WILSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Arnie Wilson and Lucy Dicker are trying to ski every day of 1994 on a
round-the-world expedition. This week they have been in Europe.
We scattered marmots as we trudged up towards Mont Gele. They are not used
to skiers at this time of the year. After a winter hibernating, they
normally find the slopes empty until summer skiing begins at the end of
June.
What the marmots did not know was that our presence was part of a rescue act
following the sudden closure of the cable cars due to take us to the
Diablerets Glacier across the valley.
At noon, when the high winds and sleet ruled the glacier out of contention
for our daily ski outing, Anita, the receptionist at the Eurotel hotel,
telephoned two other Swiss summer skiing areas - Saas-Fee and Zermatt. To
our alarm, they were closed too.
There was only one thing for it: a telephone call to Patrick Messeiller,
Verbier's tourist director, interrupting his Sunday lunch. It produced the
promise of a jeep.
Francois-Xavier, our driver, would take us as high as possible up a mountain
track. From here we could walk for half an hour or so, giving us a mile's
skiing - our minimum requirement in an emergency. Once again, for about the
tenth time this year, our bacon had been saved.
Before the bad weather, we had been enjoying the skiing at Diablerets, even
though we had to share it with 500 guides holding their annual ski races.
One run was the most beautifully-groomed piste I had ever encountered. You
only had to think a turn and it happened.
Another run, Audon, was almost four miles long and full of challenges - the
longest, most exhilarating descent we had experienced for weeks.
Earlier, we had enjoyed extensive skiing in fresh snow on Austrian glaciers
at Stubai and Solden, with the wildest and most picturesque at Pitztal and
Kaunertal, where we were again in illustrious company, sharing the slopes
with the Austrian and Swiss national ski teams.
We then faced a 450-mile drive in heavy rain from Austria, across
Switzerland and into France, where we slept at Chamonix, before skiing above
Courmayeur on the Italian side of Mont Blanc. It's all go, this search for
snow.

FT  11 JUN 94 / Arts: Slow revolution at La Scala - Andrew Clark reviews
'Rigoletto' and 'Elektra' and finds Riccardo Muti hard at work trying to
change corrupt 19th century traditions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While Milan's investigating magistrates have led the drive to clean up
Italian public life, Riccardo Muti has been campaigning to rid La Scala of
corrupt performing practices. As music director of his country's leading
opera house, Muti is finding that traditions in 19th century repertoire are
as ingrained as corruption in politics. Change requires a minor revolution.
The operas of Verdi's middle period form the crux of the battle - works
which course through La Scala's blood, arousing intense audience passions.
No one anticipates the high notes at the end of an aria more eagerly than
the Milanese; none is more ready to applaud the final flourish. Taking his
cue from recent Verdi scholarship (which Italian theatres have been
notoriously slow to acknowledge), Muti has been reminding his compatriots
that most of these display notes were not written by the composer. He also
argues that to interrupt with frequent bursts of applause is to
misunderstand Verdi's quest for dramma in musica.
Muti fired his first tentative shot four years ago when he performed La
traviata without the traditional cuts. But the educative process has only
taken wing in the past month with Rigoletto - the first time this popular
work has been performed at La Scala for 23 years. The display notes were
dropped. The performance followed the New Critical Edition to the letter.
And to propagate his ideas before the premiere, Muti held a televised
masterclass at the Milan Conservatory, during which he quoted Verdi's
letters, gave musical illustrations and explained why he did not want
interruptions for applause.
The fact that the first-night audience respected Muti's wishes is a measure
of his authority. At later performances (I attended the fourth), the
loggionisti were quick to silence any spontaneous applause. Muti wants other
Italian theatres to follow suit, and he will take his own campaign a stage
further in 1996 with Il trovatore. It may not please 'the lovers of vocal
mania', to use Muti's words, but it should lead to a 'less veristic, more
civilised' style of Verdi singing, one which accords with the current
emphasis on historical performance.
My initial reaction to Rigoletto was to regret the absence of those very
practices which lend a unique sense of theatre to Verdi performances at La
Scala. Nevertheless, the potential for a Rigoletto of clean dramatic sweep
was there. The fact that it did not materialise was due to other factors.
Two Wagnerian-length intervals sabotaged the evening's flow: one half-hour
break after the first act should be enough. And if Muti wants dramma in
musica rather than melodramma, he needs a more imaginative, less pictorial
staging.
The period settings of Ezio Frigerio and Franca Squarciapino were
Zeffirellian in scale - a gold baroque interior at the start, stained-glass
windows for the second act and a brick facade for the finale, which had the
Duke waltzing along what looked like the top floor of a derelict warehouse.
The producer, Gilbert Deflo, told the story clearly but all too
conventionally.
The singing was good if unexceptional. Roberto Alagna was the handsome young
Duke, throwing off his top notes with ease but delivering his love song to
Gilda in an unremitting forte, essaying a nice trill at the end of 'Parmi
veder' but scarcely caressing the words. There was little sign of Bellinian
grace, Gigli-like charm - or the swagger of a natural libertine.
Hobbling around like a club-footed Punch, Leo Nucci's Rigoletto captured the
public poison and private soul of the court jester, but the vocal acting
lacked distinction. The young Hungarian soprano Andrea Rost made an ideal
Gilda - innocent, pretty and musical, with a silvery voice reminiscent of
Reri Grist. Dimitri Kavrakos was the innocuous Sparafucile, Mariana
Pentcheva an unsubtle Maddalena. Despite some breathless accompaniments,
Muti's conducting bristled with grandezza and tenderness.
The other late-season production has been Elektra. La Scala always used to
import its Strauss from Germany, making sure Wolfgang Sawallisch was
available to guarantee the musical quality. This time it entrusted a new
staging to Italians. Giuseppe Sinopoli conducted - lumpily, sluggishly. Luca
Ronconi and his designers, Gae Aulenti and Giovanna Buzzi, seemed unsure
what to do with the piece. Mycenae had the trappings of a modern abattoir.
Chrysothemis and Klytemnestra wore bare-breasted feather gowns. Elektra was
reduced to a war of the bitches.
Hanna Schwarz's Klytemnestra made every word count, but was too svelte and
noble for the guilt-ridden queen. As Chrysothemis, Sabine Hass shrieked
round the stage like a hysterical bird. Gabriele Schnaut's Elektra was tame
and prosaic. The whole performance lacked tension, menace and momentum.

'Thyestes'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY

<TEXT>
Attack me with whips and snakes. The zodiac's falling. My hair's standing on
end with horror. The stars have all run away.
No, these melodramatic flights come not from some Elizabethan, Jacobean or
Romantic melodrama, but from the Roman playwright Seneca. And they come from
him by way of, of all people, Caryl Churchill, whose translation of his
Thyestes has just arrived at the Royal Court's Theatre Upstairs after its
debut last week in Manchester.
Seneca's plays are an odd mix: overblown rhetoric, lurid descriptions of
gore, and - so surprising - some remarkably acute psychological strokes. The
average Senecan speech builds one massive blockbuster effect on another,
piling Pelion on Ossa, and so it is astonishing when one character suddenly
says 'I know not what, but it is something'. Yes, it sounds like Lear. And
the gore recalls Titus Andronicus. To Seneca, however, it probably closer to
home - he had lived through the reigns of Tiberius, Caligula, and Claudius.
Thyestes re-tells the most appalling crime in all Greek mythology. Atreus
(papa to Agamemnon) kills the children of his brother Thyestes and, in a
banquet, has him (unwitting) feed on their flesh and drink their blood. The
killing and eating occur offstage, the blood-drinking onstage. Why has
Churchill turned to this gruesome tale? Partly, I guess, because it
continues the macabre studies she entered in Lives of the Great Poisoners.
Partly because Seneca had such an influence on English drama. And partly
because Seneca probably did not write for the stage and because (again, I'm
guessing) Churchill is interested in subjects that elude conventional drama.
It would help, mind you, if she did more in the play's early stages to show
who is who. Which brother are we hearing talking about the other brother? It
takes too long to discover. But Churchill's translation skilfully points up
all the play's influence on Elizabethan drama, while investing it with some
welcome modernity of utterance. Listening to her text has its rewards for
the student of Seneca, of Churchill, and Eng. lit. Most of it, however, is
dull for the theatregoer.
It might be more gripping if James Macdonald had directed the play with more
variety of inflection. The style of acting is low-key. The intention may be
to put a layer of ice over the fire in these people's guts, but the effect
is mere tepidity. Accents come from all over the British Isles. (Thyestes
and Atreus - Ewan Stewart and Kevin McMonagle  - both sound Glaswegian.)
Videos show images of events offstage; we don't see Thyestes scoffing his
kids but we do see him in post-prandial plenitude. The tone is flat,
avoiding suspense.
The result only underlines how poor Seneca was at sustaining psychological
or dramatic interest on a moment-by-moment basis. It is amazing how he kept
all the feeblest features of Greek drama while ditching or muddling all the
best. Worst, I think, are the numerous crummy fortune-cookie utterances. 'No
luck lasts. Pain and delight take it in turns.' And - my nomination for
naffest sentiment - 'You'd have to be really greedy for life if you didn't
want to die when the whole world's dying with you.' Which may be true to
think, but, in mid-drama, is mighty silly to say.

FT  11 JUN 94 / Arts: A flush of new London galleries - Some art dealers now
consider the capital to be the greatest bazaar of the world
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At a time when art dealers are tending to give up their galleries in favour
of dealing privately from home, or by appointment from an office, London is
host to an unexpected flush of new galleries.
Tuesday evening saw the leading Italian auctioneers Finarte SA open new
London premises with an exhibition of 34 works by Giorgio de Chirico.
Finarte, which has operations in Milan, Rome and Lugano, has acquired the
Matthiesen building in Mason's Yard, off Duke Street, St James's. While Old
Master dealer Patrick Matthiesen retains the building's two upper floors,
Finarte takes on the street level gallery.
It seems that the Italian auction house, which has 40-50 per cent of the
local market but, like everyone else, had a poor year in 1993, has larger
designs on the international art market. Alessandro Porro, whose grandfather
founded the business in Milan in 1959, intends to use the London space to
stage exhibitions of Italian art; to preview works of art in forthcoming
Finarte auctions; and to begin trading in the Italian paintings that the
firm has accumulated over the last 30 years - and buying more. The Finarte
pictures range from 14th century Old Masters to modern masters like de
Chirico.
Betraying the Muse: De Chirico and the Surrealists, a slightly smaller
version of a revealing polemical exhibition staged at the Paolo Balducci
Gallery in New York last month, continues at 7/8 Mason's Yard, SW1, until
July 8. A show of Italian views by Edward Lear is planned for October.
On Wednesday, Oriental art dealer Nicholas Grindley opened the doors of his
new gallery at 13 Old Burlington Street, W1. Grindley, a private dealer who
acquired the long-established Barling of Mount Street in 1989 and fell
victim to the recession two years ago, resurfaces in his original guise of
Nicholas Grindley Ltd. His inaugural show of 16th-19th century Chinese
furniture continues until June 17. And on Thursday, the well-known Milanese
dealer Johnny Eskenazi celebrated his move to London and the opening of a
gallery at 15 Old Bond Street.
Eskenazi's Milan gallery, founded by father Victor in 1925, recently moved
to smaller premises at Via Borgonuovo 5 where it will continue to deal in
collector's rugs, textiles and Oriental art, to stage scholarly exhibitions,
and to offer its textile conservation services. In London, the emphasis will
be on the sculpture of the Buddhist world, ranging from Afghanistan to
China.
'I have come to the point where I buy 100 per cent of my stock and sell most
of my best things outside Italy,' explains Eskenazi. 'London is the great
bazaar of the world. It has the largest concentration of knowledgeable and
ethical dealers, museums, scholars, auction houses, framers, shippers,
runners . . . It's the perfect machine. It is also a civilised and
culturally stimulating city.'
Perhaps most remarkable of all are the plans for the old Heim Gallery in
Jermyn Street. Daniel Katz, one of the world's few serious European
sculpture dealers, is opening that even rarer phenomenon: a substantial
sculpture gallery that also embraces other works of art - maiolica, ivories,
enamels, furniture - and Old Master paintings.
It is appropriate that he should claim the Heim space. There, in the 1960s
and '70s, Andrew Ciechanowiecki effectively re-introduced Baroque sculpture
to the shopping lists of the American museums and encouraged a new
generation of sculpture collectors. It was Katz, however, who by selling
Giambologna's marble 'Bathsheba' to the Getty in 1982 for seven-figure sum,
was responsible for partially redressing the huge imbalance between the
market value of sculpture and painting. Nevertheless, he is one of the few
dealers who probably derives as much pleasure selling something for Pounds
5,000 as a few million.
For Katz, a private dealer for over 20 years, the gallery is a challenge and
something of a mission. He hopes to communicate his passion for works of art
to as wide an audience as possible. The gallery, scheduled to open in
September, will also be used for loan exhibitions, seminars and concerts.

FT  11 JUN 94 / Arts: Pianists of distinction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN ALLISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Murray Perahia was greeted by a packed Royal Festival Hall on Wednesday for
his first solo recital there since his enforced two-year absence from the
concert platform, the result of a thumb injury complicated by infection. His
return is a cause for rejoicing - musicianship of his calibre is all too
rare today.
Some lapses in the opening Bach Partita No. 2 did not lessen the
characteristic Perahia poise. His interpretation was refreshingly free from
mannerism - thoughtful rather than 'profound' - but it remained
unpersuasive. Perahia was happier with the Classical elegance of Beethoven's
first Sonata in F minor Op. 2 No. 1, and he also caught the forward-looking
storminess of the finale in a performance full of interest.
Perahia's two Brahms pieces had warmth and subtlety, but he was on best form
for the evening's second, all-Chopin half. His manifold strengths intersect
in this repertory: the three Mazurkas danced infectiously, the Berceuse in D
flat was delicate, and the two contrasting Op. 10 Etudes had poetry (No. 3
in E) and fire (No. 4 in C sharp minor). The Ballades (Nos 1 and 3) balanced
grace and grandeur. In sum, a catalogue of Perahia's qualities.
The following evening at the Wigmore Hall, Marc-Andre Hamelin's utterly
different but no less rewarding brand of pianism was heard in an exotic
programme. The young Canadian has carved a name for himself playing music of
sensational virtuosity - though his approach is unshowy - and exploring the
byways of the repertory; this recital, entitled 'The Concert Room' was the
first of three in his 'Virtuoso Romantics' series. Devised for him by Ates
Orga, the programmes - which would have been unfashionable and even
Pianistically Incorrect a few years ago - celebrate the Golden Age of piano
playing.
Four of the five works were super-Romantic transcriptions, but Hamelin
opened with Godowsky's 1927 Passacaglia in B minor on Schubert's Unfinished
Symphony, 44 variations of mostly staggering difficulty; this was only its
third London performance. Hamelin's wizardry defies the laws of nature, but
it is a mark of his seriousness that he used it only to illuminate the
composer's musical intentions. An aura similar to the one that surrounds
Godowsky attached itself to Alkan - the only pianist Liszt is said to have
feared - whose transcription of the first movement of Beethoven's Piano
Concerto No. 3 came next. Hamelin set up an impressive dialogue between
'piano' and 'orchestra', and took the notorious Alkan cadenza in his stride.
In the second half, the sheer brilliance of a Paganini-Liszt Etude was
tempered by a dreamy performance of Balakirev's arrangement of the Romanza
from Chopin's first Piano Concerto. More familiar territory was reached in
Liszt's glorious transcription of the Tannhauser Overture, dazzling and
delicate by turns.
Hamelin's 'Virtuoso Romantics' continue of June 16 ('Grand Opera and Song')
and June 30 ('The Salon').

FT  11 JUN 94 / Arts: Romantics from the north - Reinhart Foundation
exhibition at the National Gallery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Romanticism is one of those useful terms of critical labelling that means
just what we choose it to mean. It may be no more than a mood or attitude -
a long cloak, a wide hat and a dark look. Precisely applied, it invokes the
refinement and self-conscious celebration of sensibility that found
particular expression from the 1770s on, the age of Goethe, Byron,
Beethoven, Gericault, Delacroix, Turner . . .
In taking us from Friedrich to Hodler and into the 20th century, A Romantic
Tradition at the National Gallery seems to want it both ways. At the start,
with Wolf we have the celebration of nature and the sublime, with Friedrich
himself the yearning melancholy of heightened feeling, with Fuseli all the
melodrama of sturm und drang. At the end, with Bocklin and Hodler, we have
sexual symbolism and incipient expressionism. And in between we have a lot
of interesting, unfamiliar and lovely works that are Romantic only if we say
they are. To trace the evolution of early 19th-century Romanticism into
fin-de-siecle symbolism would be as good a peg as any on which to hang an
exhibition, but it would require either a broader international scope than
this admits, or a sharper critical focus.
As it is, the exhibition is limited to the northern European schools,
principally German and Swiss with the odd Dane and Norwegian, by the very
nature of the Reinhart collections. Its positive virtue - and it is indeed a
lovely exhibition - lies rather, and paradoxically, in its uncritical
miscellaneity. We are in this country grievously unfamiliar with the later
northern European schools. The National Gallery has long recognised the
deficiency in its own collections and has begun to repair it - but only
begun: the constraints of our funding policies are ever to be endured. The
chance to see this range of work, to recognise masters hitherto unknown to
us, to take them as they come and to draw fresh comparisons is most welcome.
Friedrich himself is now familiar enough, but his works here are especially
fine and, beside his usual images of setting suns and distant towers,
fraught with the religious symbolism of our path through life, includes more
straight-forward and cheerful landscapes, most remarkable the vertiginous
view down the chalk cliffs at Rugen, which he and his wife visited on their
honeymoon in 1818. No less remarkable, and rather more to the point, are the
looming mountains and glaciers of the 18th century painter, Caspar Wolf, all
painted in the 1770s, the decade of Friedrich's birth.
The Swiss, Jacques-Laurent Agasse, who studied with David in Paris in the
1780s and spent much of his career in England - the Tate rescued him from
our ignorance a year or two ago - features prominently. His affinity with
Stubbs in particular, that famous Romantic, and English sporting and genre
Realism in general, is manifest. It is Agasse who establishes the thread of
Realism that runs through the show, and bourgeois or Biedermeier Realism at
that. The connection with Victorian anecdotal painting, the pre-Raphaelites
and later Social Realism throughout Europe - Ring, Guthrie, Bastien-Lepage -
is easy to sustain.
There are 'The Village Politicians' of Wilhelm Liebel (1877); the portraits
and domestic groups of Albert Anker, notably the large and delightful Creche
(1890), in which a host of children is given soup by a young and beautifully
serious deaconess; the mid-century landscapes of Zund, Koller and Calame;
the looser proto-expressionist studies of Carl Blechen in the 1820s and 30s.
Most remarkable and beautiful of all is the Dane, Christen Kobke's view of a
sailing party just returned (1839), the sail furled, the wind dropped and
the evening coming on, and all so still and febrile in its clarity.
There is much else to recommend, and the works on paper, shown separately in
the Sunley Room, are not to be missed, most especially the pastels and
gouaches of Adolph von Menzel. A fine woman sits with her arms folded, her
eyes shaded by her straw hat, a strong image beautifully realised. It was
made up from a note taken on a boat-trip. The sketchbook source, we are
told, shows that the poor woman, shortly before, had been violently sick.
There is Romantic for you.
Caspar David Friedrich to Ferdinand Hodler: A Romantic Tradition - 19th
century paintings and drawings from the Oskar Reinhart Foundation,
Winterthur; the National Gallery, Trafalgar Square WC2, until September 4,
then on to Geneva.

FT  11 JUN 94 / Arts: Dazzled by identity crises - Video

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   A Professor of Aesthetics I once knew
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
white-haired and Russian-accented, like the old psychiatrist in Hitchcock's
Spellbound - told me that there are two kinds of movie experience.
One is like falling asleep and entering the dream state: films touched with
the surreal or fantastic like Fassbinder's Querelle (Artificial Eye) or
Nicolas Roeg's Eureka (MGM/UA), both new out on video. The other kind is
like getting up in the morning. You draw the curtain and reality's light
dazzles you, routing the goblins of the night. Finest example
cassette-released this month: Ken Loach's Raining Stones (Ist Independent),
the brightest movie in years from British realism's brightest modern
exponent.
The Professor refused to accept that there was any kind of film other than
these two. I suspect he is mostly right. A mighty chasm separates the poetic
impulses of, say, Fassbinder's Genet fantasia, filmed amid glowing painted
sets, or Roeg's fable-like film about a Kane-ish millionaire journeying to
self-destruction (powerhouse acting by Gene Hackman) and the beautiful human
pulse of Loach's picture of an 'ordinary' Northern family, as clinkingly
familiar as the milk bottles outside the front door.
Yet there are truancies and exceptions to the Professor's rule. Some
film-makers love to fool us into thinking they are making a dream-movie when
they are making a realistic one and vice versa. Alex van Warmerdam's The
Northerners (Curzon) is a Dutch fantasy that behaves for a long time like
the primmest suburban soap or sitcom. You think you have parted the curtains
for a morning's snooping on the neighbours: the married woman sneaking off
to the butcher's shop out of hours, the postman who peeks at people's
letters, the boy who peers through windows.
But then you realise the story is spiralling into poetic dementia. Soon
there are wild animals, ghostly bodies in the nearby forest pool, a sense of
history and barbarism creeping in from the town's edges. Strange and
marvellous.
Then there is Rising Sun (Fox), written and directed by Philip Kaufman from
the novel by Michael 'Jurassic Park' Crichton. Ah] we cry at first. A
techno-fantasy about Them (Japs) versus Us (the West). But allowing for a
little generation-gap formalism in the casting - Sean Connery for the WASPS
and wrinklies, Wesley Snipes for the young and ethnic - little in this film
is fantastical or improbable at all.
America is indeed riven with anxiety about a new Pearl Harbor in the
boardroom. And the 'preposterous' subplot, in which a murder is covered up
by some outlandish video-tampering, is technically wholly plausible. This
film seems a piece of midnight mind-sorcery but is really more an
open-the-morning-curtains movie.
Then there is the kind of film that does not seem itself to know what it is.
Olivier's enduringly majestic Richard III (Video Collection) thinks that it
is turning from poetry to realism, from the hieratic to the
documentary-historical, when it debouches from those painted sets into a
'real' Battle of Bosworth. But the real trees and bushes only set off more
the inspired stylisations of Olivier's acting, twitching like Nijinsky even
in his al fresco death throes.
The Professor could say that these films prove his point: after a little
initial teasing they fall into place on the side of the real or poetic. But
some good movies, pace the Prof, defy the most determined viewer to place
them in either category. Jane Campion's The Piano (Entertainment In Video)
swept across festivals and film award nights last year, stealing every prize
in sight including two acting Oscars. One was for Holly Hunter as the mute
Scottish heroine thrown into wildest New Zealand in the mid-19th century.
There she tests the mettle of her 'civilised' values on missionary Sam Neill
and brutish foreman Harvey Keitel.
The other Oscar was for Anna Paquin as her daughter. Miss P was mute only on
Oscars night, when she opened and shut her mouth like a goldfish in shock.
But then that is the viewer's reaction to this astonishing tale of violence,
sex and emotional rite-of-passage, set in a world as starkly real as it is
hauntingly oneiric.

FT  11 JUN 94 / Arts: Brecht par excellence - A look at a new, exciting
'Threepenny Opera'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JACKIE WULLSCHLAGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Play it as cabaret, and it swoons with ragtime nostalgia. As theatre, it is
sharp, anti-bourgeois satire. As a musical, it is easy escapism. It can be
sentimental, witty or a critique on German society: for all these reasons
Brecht's Threepenny Opera is the most popular piece in the German repertory.
The latest staging from the Dresden State Theatre is the most thrilling I
have seen. Its genius is to harness Weill's music to a vivid and original
psychological reading of the play. This adds a new satiric edge to both
songs and drama and pulls them together in tight artistic cohesion.
Given life and form by impeccable ensemble playing and a set which is pure
theatrical magic, it is vintage Brecht and proof that the Brechtian
traditions which inspired East German theatre for decades are still
thriving.
What a revelation to see Brecht's characters taken beyond the usual
stereotypes - the whore, Jenny, the criminal, Mack the Knife, the innocent
girl, Polly - into rounded, changing people whose relationships drive the
action. Best is Polly, played with every nerve and muscle by Anna-Katherina
Muck. At first, she is a God-fearing girl hardly able to breathe for the
ecstasy of marrying in a (stolen) white open-top Trabby, decked-out with
plastic flowers.
During her wedding night, saxophones and trumpets ominously whirr and
wind-down as if their batteries had run out; the next day, Mack flees. In a
snatch at worldly wisdom, Polly sings one of Jenny's songs; the orchestral
accompaniment - jazzy, up-beat, naive for Polly, languorous and resentful
for Jenny - plays out the mocking contrast.
Back home, her toddler-tantrum - chubby legs flying, stockings falling down
 -as she boasts to her parents of her husband's underworld connections, is
the spur for the Peachums to get Mack hanged. The emotional point is that
she has married her father. Peachum, the Beggar King (Hans Jorn Weber) and
Mack the Knife (Michael Neuenschwander) are both giant, charismatic figures,
slick dressers and smooth talkers, one controlling his crooks, the other his
paupers, with the same menacing flick-of-the-wrist or twist-of-the-head. The
political point, that both are profiteers in collusion with the state, is
here a sub-text.
Against a stunning tower-block set, the power game works as a formally
choreographed dance. A siren shriek and a dozen secret brick-doors burst
open to reveal Mack's criminals, pants down, each hiding in a urinal.
Seconds later, the doors shut and fly open again, each showing a beggar with
his props of wooden legs and eye-patches.
Bathed in purple light, the cubicles next become a brothel which Peachum and
Mack fight to control. Mack sings the Procurer's Ballad pulling up
half-dressed whores from the floor, thrusting at them and then letting them
fall. When one of them sings back in the throaty bass of the Streetsinger,
there is a whiff of real 1920s decadence.
Like the themes of Klaus Dieter Kirst's production, the set keeps opening
out on to new levels. A slice of brickwork vanishes and a beggars' chorus
appears on a neon ramp. Then, a flood of light, the Peachum apartment
shining through a high window and the action leaps to the roof of the stage.
In the finale, beggars, tarts, thugs and policemen, all draped in
fluorescent grey raincoats and carrying umbrellas and wreaths, snake their
way from top to bottom of the set to watch Mack hang. There is the lightest
flurry of snow, then the Streetsinger, wearing archangel wings, arrives by
bicycle to deliver a happy ending. This brought a standing ovation from the
audience at the Brussels Saxony Festival, where I caught this production.
Here is a Threepenny Opera, as Brecht hoped it would be, 'so splendid that
only beggars can imagine it.' Let us hope it visits Britain soon. The
production continues at the Staatschauspiel, Dresden. The Brussels Saxony
Festival runs through June.

FT  11 JUN 94 / Arts: A demonic 'Don'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Since the bicentenary year the most exciting performances of Mozart's operas
in London have not been in an opera-house. This irony is thanks to John
Eliot Gardiner, whose enormously successful series of the major operas is
presumably nearing completion.
Like so many important musical projects, Gardiner's Mozart operas have been
undertaken with an eye on recordings. The live performances which have been
scheduled alongside have toured Europe, sometimes in fully-staged
productions, but in London only as semi-staged concert performances at the
Queen Elizabeth Hall. That was, at least, until this week's Don Giovanni,
when the stage action grew to engulf the entire hall.
Of the three Mozart/Da Ponte comedies, Don Giovanni is surely the one most
suited to Gardiner's gifts. There is nothing warm or relaxed about his
Mozart, nothing soft-centred. His intellectual background comes across as
rigorous clarity of thought in performance, driven along by the energy that
has taken him to the top of his profession. Nobody in the English Baroque
Soloists or Monteverdi Choir is slack with Gardiner as conductor.
From the opening chords of the Overture their playing made the spine tingle.
The drama was brutally intense, the comedy hard-driven, as though the music
was constantly poised on a knife edge between violence and laughter. Rodney
Gilfry's Don Giovanni personified this dual character, always larking about,
a young man who had gone off the rails and was now wholly irresponsible,
ruining lives half for fun, half for sadistic delight. He had plenty of
charisma.
For Cos fan tutte, his previous opera in the series, Gardiner chose young
singers who could be moulded in his image, more notable for their blend as
an ensemble than any individuality. This time he went to the opposite
extreme and we had a diverse international cast with as many styles and
personalities as there were singers.
It is always a bonus to have an Italian as Leporello and Ildebrando
D'Arcangelo was one of the best; young, humorous, every word clear. The
words came and went in Luba Orgonasova's self-consciously artful singing as
Donna Anna, but she rose to the classical poise of her second-act aria. It
might have been better if she had exchanged roles with Charlotte Margiono's
outgoing Donna Elvira. Eirian James sang with warm beauty of tone as
Zerlina, but her Masetto, Julian Clarkson, was a bit of a character.
Christoph Pregardien made a forthright Don Ottavio, denied his second aria.
As ever challenging accepted ideas, Gardiner performed the later, Vienna
version of the opera - an interesting change to the usual, but not an
improvement.
In the final scene Andrea Silvestrelli's Commendatore, as huge of voice as
he is of person, descended menacingly from the back of the hall, while
Gilfry's insolent Giovanni strutted back and forth in impatience. As the
demons surrounded the audience, Gardiner unleashed the music as if all hell
had been let loose. It is a long time since London saw a Don Giovanni to
touch this.

Ludwigsburg

ATHENS ON TRIAL by Jennifer Tolbert Roberts Princeton University Press
Pounds 25, 391 pages
RECASTING CONSERVATISM by Robert Devigne Yale University Press Pounds 20,
268 pages
When Chinese students occupied Tiananmen Square in 1989, they raised a
statue they called 'the Goddess of Democracy'. In 1979 their older siblings
turned a length of Peking brick into 'Democracy Wall', where freedom of
expression briefly flourished. In both cases the name and spirit of
democracy were summoned to oppose the geriatric tyrants in the Forbidden
City.
China still waits for democracy, but Tiananmen Square did much to make
possible the 1989 revolutions in Eastern Europe. The crowds there likewise
invoked democracy, and we here applauded. 'Democracy' is a feel-good word;
it is what the west officially stands for and defends. Who would now dream
of saying that oligarchy or plutocracy or dictatorship is preferable?
It was by no means ever thus. In her absorbing book Jennifer Tolbert Roberts
traces the history of anti-democratic sentiment in western civilisation from
classical Athens to today. It is a chastening tale. Until recently,
democracy was vilified as the despotism of poor, ignorant majorities over
better-off and better educated minorities. Since most of those able to
record their opinions belonged to the latter class, history resounds with
their condemnation of any political arrangement that allows the Great
Unwashed a say in affairs of state.
Athens in the fifth and fourth centuries BC was not a perfect democracy.
Women, slaves and aliens had no say, and men only reached adulthood at 30.
But at its height under Pericles the Athenian democracy produced art,
architecture, drama and philosophy of such power and excellence that they
continue to shape western civilisation. Yet even then democracy had its
opponents. The aristocratic Plato attacked it for putting management of the
state into the hands of ignoramuses. He blamed it for making the citizenry
'idle, cowardly, loquacious and greedy' and for devouring those - Pericles,
Miltiades, Themistocles - who had promoted it in the first place.
With the philosophers of Athens against it, democracy had little chance
among later thinkers. Renaissance writers were convinced it meant constant
tumult. Enlightenment moralists saw it as a threat to virtue. America's
founding fathers believed it led to the equalisation of property. And when
the grudging shift to something approaching democracy happened in Britain
between 1830 and 1930, its opponents claimed they were being sold to the
rabble.
What has lately made democracy not just respectable but something to die
for? Roberts answer is: 19th century historians, who rescued Athenian
democracy from the opprobrium of earlier historians. In associating
democratic ideals with the glories of Periclean Athens the theory of
democracy was at last made respectable. But for how long?
In his scholarly book about recent conservatism in Britain and America
Robert Devigne says something of more than merely theoretical importance:
that whereas conservative theory and practice in America has resulted in
devolution of political authority, British conservatism has effected a rapid
centralisation of power.
Devigne sees Britain's swing to right-wing authoritarianism as the alarmed
reaction to perceived national decline. British political institutions have
always been carefully arranged to dissipate the effects of democracy, a fact
as welcomed by Labour politicians when in office as by Conservative
politicians at all times. But if Devigne is right about the contemporary
British Conservative Party, it would seem that it is less than ever disposed
to keep private its hostility to democratic ideas.
Roberts shows how ideas have their day. When time next brings in its
revenges, what kind of -ocracy or -archy will be the flavour of the epoch?
And how shall we like being even less in control of affairs than we now are?

FT  11 JUN 94 / Books: Intoxicated angel of US letters - A look at a new
biography of Scott Fitzgerald
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JDF JONES

<TEXT>
SCOTT FITZGERALD by Jeffrey Meyers Macmillan Pounds 17.99, 400 pages
Literary biography is an impossible art. You can detail the life of the
writer, but how can you ever begin to understand what happens when he sits
down at his solitary desk? We know, for instance, from so many biographies,
of the events that made up Joseph Conrad's life - the Polish uncle, ships in
the South China Sea, - but we can never hope to be present at that moment
when he turns to his manuscript of Heart of Darkness.
Scott Fitzgerald presents another, rather different example. From his CV,
from the notebooks, from the memoirs of friends, we know he was an appalling
species of a young American. He was callow, arrogant, snobbish,
self-absorbed, irresponsible, hedonistic and - most important of all - he
was a drunk. Yet - and yet] - he was one of the most wonderful writers of
this century. So how does one understand those hung-over mornings when he
staggered back to the draft of The Great Gatsby? Let alone those doomed,
liver-dead days in Hollywood 15 years later as he struggled, and failed, to
finish The Last Tycoon? We can never know what happened inside his head, and
he, like most writers, was not able to tell us.
Jeffrey Meyers is an American academic and an extremely prolific biographer
of 20th-century novelists: he knocks off these books with near-annual
enthusiasm, and sometimes it shows. With Scott Fitzgerald he has taken on a
subject as difficult as any: there is a classic biography by Arthur Mizener
dating back 40 years (The Far Side of Paradise) and various later efforts
including the purple and indulgent but very detailed Some Sort of Epic
Grandeur by Fitzgerald's academic guardian, Matthew Bruccoli. Do we need
another?
The answer, I'm afraid, must be negative. This one is supposed to be 'more
analytic and interpretive', but the story is more or less the same (except
for new light on one of the less important mistresses) and the discussion of
the books is pedestrian and unilluminating: to mention just one example, the
comparison with, and influence of, Conrad needs much more attack and
development to be worthwhile.
There is less sympathy than in earlier biographies for Fitzgerald's
all-too-evident shortcomings. We get the drinking and the hooliganism, the
nightmare of a wife called Zelda, the bluffer and failure as student,
sportsman, soldier, the limitations of writing that was based on personal
experience.
But the remaining and unexplained mystery is that Fitzgerald produced such
wonderful fiction and wrote like an angel. In 1919 he retreated to St Paul
and, by dint of hard work, turned himself that summer from Princeton poseur
into a professional writer, able from then on to spin highly paid
short-stories as well as the real stuff, so that by 1920 he was famous for
This Side of Paradise. In the middle of the sophomoric nonsense on the
Riviera in 1924, and despite Zelda, he managed to write The Great Gatsby.
In those years the tragic pattern was established: he churned out stories
for the Saturday Evening Post to support his extravagant life style while
always understanding that he ought to be devoting himself to the novels: 'I
now get Dollars 2000 a story,' he wrote to a friend, 'and they get worse and
worse, and my ambition is to get where I need write no more but only novels
. . .' Gatsby made no money.
Meyers is so stern on his subject that, beyond admitting the man had
'charm', he understates the sheer hard slog, the professionalism, the
perseverance-beyond-the-bottle, which made Fitzgerald so much more than a
handsome lush. And of course, Meyers cannot explain the gift.
The relationship with Hemingway will always fascinate, and Meyers, who is
also a biographer of Hemingway, should be qualified to discuss what was both
friendship and rivalry. Fitzgerald, wrote Hemingway early on, 'had a
marvellous talent and the thing is to use it - not whine in public'. In a
later memoir by his son, he was reported as saying, 'Scott's writing got
better and better, but no-one realised it, not even Scott. Despite his
rummyhood and perhaps because of Zelda, who really made him the box with the
handles, he got better and better. The stuff he was writing at the end was
the best of all. Poor bastard.'
So Papa got it right. As did Scott himself, when he wrote, to his wife, 'I
think everyone . . . guessed at your almost megalomaniacal selfishness and
my insane indulgence to drink . . .'
That was one part of the truth: at another level, his Princeton friend and
later editor Edmund Wilson wrote: 'He has been given imagination without
intellectual control of it; he has been given the desire for beauty without
an aesthetic ideal; and he has been given a gift for expression without very
many ideas to express'.
Some friend] Was Wilson right? The only response is to go back to the books.
Go back, also, to The Crack-up, that extraordinarily brave self-analysis,
and the Notebooks, where you will read his sad epitaph: 'Then I was drunk
for many years, and then I died'.

THE FOLDING STAR by Alan Hollinghurst Chatto &amp; Windus Pounds 15.99, 422
pages
Imagine a gay erotic fantasy offered on video. Could it not convincingly run
like this? Thirty three year old Edward Manners may wear spectacles and be
more than a touch overweight, but when it comes to sex the hottest guys just
cannot keep their hands off him. No wonder that when he arrives in an
ancient Flemish city to teach 17-year-old, big-bottomed blond Luc, who has
just been expelled from school after being found drinking with sailors,
Edward's thoughts soon stray from strict tutorial matters. Of course it is
not that long before he is regularly stealing Luc's Y-fronts and wearing
them as his own. And when the long delayed climax comes, his pupil gladly
ends up giving into Edward's wild desires.
This may seem a disgracefully prejudiced form of reductionism. Madame Bovary
or Anthony and Cleopatra, if stripped to their bare sexual essentials, might
be similarly made to seem derisorily crude. But Alan Hollinghurst's most
disturbing second novel, following on six years after his historic debut
with the impressive The Swimming Pool Library, seems morally vacuous in
comparison.
Its account of an obsessive, mainly unspoken passion, as filtered through
the first person narrative of Edward's highly intelligent and eloquent mind,
discloses a disquieting gulf between adult responsibility and erotic
reverie. It is as if Edward reduces people to the status of cherishable
sexual objects.
This may of course be precisely Hollinghurst's point, but in The Swimming
Pool Library its hero, the rich hedonistic lay about and lay-anything-sexy
hero, Will Beckwith is subjected to a devastating comeupence. In the novel's
process Hollinghurst sets gay English life in an early and mid-20th century
context of persecution, ostracism and furtive enjoyment and he contrasts
these periods with the early 1980s pursuit of sexual plenty, seeing it as a
joyful response to earlier repressions.
But times have horribly changed since 1983, the date in which the romping
pleasures of The Swimming Pool Library were placed. And yesterday's
freelance sexual opportunism has been qualified by Aids. Yet Hollinghurst's
hero, apart from a glancing reference to his HIV negative status and the
death of an earlier lover who had Aids, apparently inhabitants a condomless
world, the virus out of sight and mind.
Edward would justify his prying, spying obsession with Luc as the symptoms
for his love. The cliched expression of his longings indicate, however, a
considerable unease over such desires.
Nothing in the tone of the narrator's pedantic and pomped-up voice suggests
more than the spur of thoroughgoing lust in pursuit of its objects.
Buildings and places, to which Edward's roving eye are constantly drawn,
seem far more compassionately viewed.
Hollinghurst's thematic business, despatched in what could be termed a
cliff-hanger, is not just concerned with the nuances of obsession. His
concern is with the exploration of what lies concealed or buried behind
human and pictorial facades. Edward's search for the real Luc - though that
seems pretty clear, sexually speaking - runs in parallel to his
investigation of the dead symbolist painter Edgard Orst, and a case of
homosexual concealment and betrayal when the Nazis were barbarically rampant
in Europe.
You may appreciate and succumb to Hollinghurst's artful and most eloquent
composition of a triptych of passionate concealment and secret distresses,
and the impact of revelation but I doubt that the relationship between the
parts is that luminous or significant, for at the heart of the novel with
its chilly elusive core is a strange sense of homosexuals, whether today or
in the earlier 20th century, as men in whom conscience or morality looms
small.
The first person narrative can be a form in which the author veils his own
motives and beliefs. So I cannot therefore directly accuse Hollinghurst's
novel of indicting or impugning homosexuals. But I am mightily suspicious
that he makes just such a partial and sweeping case.

IN SEARCH OF CHURCHILL by Martin Gilbert HarperCollins Pounds 20, 338 pages
After all the heavy stuff on Churchill, here is some light relief. Martin
Gilbert has come out with the Agatha Christie side of the historian's art.
Gilbert was a young Oxford history graduate when in 1962 he was reluctantly
roped in as a researcher on what was to become Churchill's official
biography. Since then he has devoted most of his working life to the
subject. What may well be the longest biography ever written (eight volumes)
was completed in 1988. A large, single volume life of Churchill by Gilbert
appeared in 1991. And still the work on the accompanying Churchill documents
goes on: there may be another five volumes of these to come, making a total
of 15.
Don't be deterred by the statistics. In Search of Churchill is largely fun.
It tells the tale of how Gilbert became involved in the first place, then
how he set about his continuing task.
There are three key figures: Winston Churchill; his son, Randolph, and
(modestly) Gilbert himself who took charge of the project when Randolph died
in 1968. The book is phenomenally, sentimentally pro practically everything
to do with the Churchill family, but not much the worse for that.
In some ways the hero is Randolph, the wild journalist/politician who never
seemed quite to pull anything off. He succeeded, however, in putting
together a team to write his father's life. He also installed a journalistic
discipline: go on looking for sources and, when you have found them, check
them and look for more.
When Gilbert first arrived at East Bergholt as a potential recruit, he was
met by what he took to be an ordinary driver. The man turned out to be
Michael Wolff, who was already the director of research and subsequently
political adviser to Edward Heath.
Wolff, like Randolph, died early. After an argument with Lord Hartwell of
the Daily Telegraph, who thought his paper had proprietary rights to appoint
the new Churchill biographer, it was left to Gilbert to complete the job.
Gilbert abandoned a commission to write the official life of Sir Stafford
Cripps and, apart from a brief fling with Harold Wilson, has been with
Churchill ever since.
He set to work like a detective. Apart from the official records, there was
always the question of who said/wrote what to whom, and in what tone of
voice, let alone what was unrecorded. Gilbert spoke to everyone he could
find: secretaries, civil servants, old military men, anyone who had come
across Churchill. When Churchill left Downing Street as prime minister for
the last time, the press simply reported that he did so with 'an unknown
woman'. Gilbert identified her as Elizabeth Gilliatt, a Churchill secretary
since 1945, a useful source on how Churchill worked.
Sometimes Gilbert advertised for material in the newspapers. At others,
sources came to him out of the blue. One such was Judy Montagu, daughter of
Venetia Stanley, who turned up in Oxford with a laundry basket full of
letters written to her mother by prime minister Asquith. The letters
explained a great deal about why Asquith did not push Churchill for much of
a role in the 1916 coalition with Lloyd George: his mind was on other
matters, for the new government was formed on the day that Asquith heard
that Venetia was getting married.
Not all the high level sources were immediately helpful. Sir John Colville,
for years Churchill's private secretary, was initially reticent. Gilbert
thinks that may have been because Colville had previously worked for Neville
Chamberlain. Then it turned out that Colville was ready to publish his own
diaries - almost unprecedented at the time.
Harold Wilson came as a late source. He had praised Churchill greatly on his
death and Gilbert asked him why. It was partly because Churchill had so very
kind to him when Wilson resigned from the Attlee government in 1951. Gilbert
then helped with Wilson's book on 1964-70. He found Wilson questioning him
about Churchill's later years in Downing Street. 'I do not want to decline
in office,' Wilson said.
There are also anecdotes and historical insights: Churchill in old age
watching the film of Wuthering Heights and finally commenting, 'What
terrible weather they have in Yorkshire'. The origins of Churchill's Battle
of Britain tribute seems to have been a speech on the launching of the Queen
Mary in 1935: 'Never in the history of transatlantic travel has so much been
done for those who travel tourist.' Best of all is Gilbert's warning as a
historian: 'Never fully trust any recollection. Beware of memory, even one's
own]'
Although perhaps unduly protective of the Churchill reputation, the book
nevertheless is immensely enjoyable.

FT  11 JUN 94 / Books: Alliance of spiritual and secular gain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CRISTINA ODONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WE BELIEVE by Monsignor Gilbey Bellew Publishing Pounds 14.94, 260 pages
It is one of the best-known, most often-quoted tenets of the New Testament:
it is impossible to serve both God and Mammon. For millennia, that
scriptural dictum has spurred God-fearing money men to fill Church coffers
and cough up charitable donations - convinced, all the while, that their
burgeoning bank accounts barred access to the moral high ground. How
gratifying, then, for these proverbial camels seeking to pass through the
eye of a needle, to witness the alliance of spiritual and secular gain in
the one-man publishing phenomenon that is Mgr Gilbey.
The frock-coated monsignor, scion of the gin-producing Gilbeys and, at 93,
still a passionate beagler, has been a cult figure among young fogeys
(disciples include chief secretary of the Treasury Michael Portillo) since
his days as Catholic chaplain at Cambridge. His vision of a tradition-bound
Church and society wherein the ancient hierarchical code is respected, and
indeed enforced, by men and women committed to a definable and transcendent
authority, has struck a chord in those who bemoan the present moral and
social confusion. While politicians pay lip service to the ethical until
their peccadilloes are uncovered; and the chattering classes try to
marginalise the moral in a collective rush for the fool's gold of relative
values, Gilbey has raised a lone voice in our moral wilderness. He calls for
a top-to-bottom revisionism and his views are enthusing a growing number of
men and women disenchanted with the status quo.
His increasing popularity has been the happy discovery of the publisher who
has collected, genie-in-the-bottle style, Mgr Gilbey's pronouncements - on
everything from favourite authors to sins of the flesh.
Journalist-turned-publisher Glenys Roberts knows she is on to a good thing
with the traditionalist monsignor: first with the Commonplace Book and now
with We Believe - the hard-back re-issuing of Gilbey's ABCs of the Catholic
faith - Roberts has watched her cleric's groupies turn his books into cult
classics. The Commonplace Book is now in its third reprint, and advance
orders for We Believe look set to compete with the first.
Timing, of course, is of the essence. Mgr Gilbey's philosophy of life -
based on a revulsion at egalitarianism as the enemy of promise, and at
collectivism as the foe of individual achievement - makes a great deal of
sense in a society that, having renounced hierarchy as an oppressive force,
finds itself drowning in mediocrity. For Gilbey, a dramatic renewal could
take place if everyone - Catholic and non-Catholic alike - were to pledge
allegiance to a well-defined authority and accept a place within the
structure that bolstered it; this, in the Gilbey cosmology, finds
socio-political translation in a nostalgia for the ancien regime.
Both roots and reins are necessary to our sense of well-being, argues
Gilbey, echoing Thomas Aquinas. But where the good Doctor of the Church
limited himself to the spiritual realm, Mgr Gilbey stretches his argument to
cover our secular world: a pecking order that pigeonholes us provides an
important sense of identity; a check-list of civic dos and don'ts must
accompany the spiritual guidelines set out in the Commandments and detailed
in the catechism (Mgr Gilbey does a line by line exegesis of the traditional
catechism; the latest version, out last month, will probably warrant a new
appendix). In essence, for our collective welfare we must harness the
nation's energy to reinstate the trinity of religion, authority and
tradition.
Unlike the great majority of his fellow Christian clerics, Mgr Gilbey does
not regard capitalism as the seedbed of social evil. Liberation theology,
the preferential option for the poor, and the Christian Socialism preached
by the late Labour leader John Smith and his probable successor Tony Blair -
all receive the thumbs down from the well-bred Mgr. When Christ enjoined the
young man to give up all his belongings and follow him, he was not issuing a
commandment but a counsel - setting up a goal which we should only strive
for if we want to be ideal Christians. For those of us who are content to be
merely good Christians, there is no need to forgo worldly goods. Phew.
What Mgr Gilbey campaigns for is a society built upon a firm and clearly
defined structure and bleached of political correctness and wishy-washy
liberalism. He teaches that spiritual and civic rules are necessary and
should not be breached, for they establish a context within which we can
operate and, hopefully, flourish. To some this will sound like the
fist-thumping speech of a tooth-brush moustacheoed spiritual dictator, whose
loyal followers will goose-step behind him towards the City of God. But for
many, Mgr Gilbey has called our 20th century bluff and points to a golden
future based on an idyllic past.

FT  11 JUN 94 / Minding Your Own Business: These willows are not for weeping
 -A look at an agricultural enterprise involving rapid growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE FEWINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lionel Hill was within four days of installing Pounds 4,000-worth of straw
burning equipment, plus associated pipework, to heat his 12 roomed Victorian
brick farmhouse when he heard about willow.
Not the ornamental sort, nor the type cultivated for cricket bats, but
biomass varieties - clones specially developed for their fast-growing
qualities and ability to provide timber for burning.
'What on earth is biomass?' he asked engineer David Wilks, the old friend
who introduced him to the idea. Wilks explained the principle of wood grown
specifically for burning and put him in touch with the Long Ashton Research
Station near Bristol, whose willow expert, Ken Stott, visited him.
As a result, Hill threw out the straw boiler idea and opted instead for a
Pounds 5,000 Scandinavian woodchip boiler. And in the last eight years, he
has become one of the small but increasing number of farmers growing biomass
material on their land, on his 72-acre farm at Feckenham near Redditch.
'Ken initially drove up from Bristol because he wanted to find a quarter of
an acre on a site well away from Long Ashton where he could plant a number
of willow clones for trial purposes,' said Hill.
'I agreed and allowed him the use of a quarter acre of rather poor land
above an old tip. Ken persuaded me to spray and plough it in the winter of
1986 and I knew I was getting interested when he came a few months later
with boxes of cuttings for planting and persuaded me to let him use two of
my men for three days for marking out the plots and planting.
Not only was all this free, but Ken also managed to extract money from me
for the specimens we planted - 26 different clones of willow and eight
clones of poplar. The total cost to me was Pounds 1,225.'
Before long, Hill was putting more money into the enterprise - planting,
spraying against weeds, and buying and maintaining machinery. He reckons
work on the trial plots alone - initially it started as a spare-time
activity - cost him Pounds 3,200.
'I was at first happy to regard it as a pastime, subsidised by the farm and
the plant hire business I had started in Bromsgrove 23 years previously and
which had been highly profitable in the early years,' said Hill.
'My initial interest, if I am honest, was as much in providing cover for the
birds that seemed to be disappearing at an alarming rate, as in serious
experimentation. By the time I was hooked on willow growing I had outlayed
well over Pounds 10,000 and seen virtually nothing back.
'I knew that arable coppice, as it is correctly called, was an uncertain
enterprise but my wife Helen and I both found it fascinating.'
The numbers of farmers following Hill's lead are still small.
'However I know they must be growing as our sales of biomass material have
risen from Pounds 7,650 in 1991-92, when we started in earnest, to Pounds
9,500 in 1992-93, to Pounds 22,500 in 1993-94. This year we sold materials
to the value of Pounds 19,000 in our first three months.'
'Materials' include cuttings ('sticks') for planting; long willow wands,
which they sell at Pounds 125 a ton for the stabilisation of motorway
embankments and other forms of bio-engineering; and chippings for burning.
In 1990 the Hills had to buy in wood to burn for heating the farm (their
uprated burner is now a 150kW model and heats the outbuildings as well as
the farmhouse) but the tree growth has been so fast that by next year they
reckon they will have to seek new outlets for woodchips. 'I anticipate
selling woodchips to the garden trade for use as a mulch,' Hill said.
Cropping is on a one, two or three year rotational basis - the whole process
is known as SRC - short rotational cropping. A big expenditure last year was
on a Pounds 7,500 prototype automated cutting machine. 'It is perfect for
cutting straight into a large stand of young willows and removing long rods,
but it is tractor-drawn and we may have to spend more to adapt it to be
self-propelled, mounted on tracks,' Hill said.
Another expenditure was the cold store needed for cuttings taken in the
winter dormant period that might be sold at any time during the following
year.
Helen Hill, who looks after the books, reckons that after eight years they
are just at break-even point with the willows.
'We would not even have got this far if it had not been for grants of Pounds
550 an acre in 1991, 92 and 93 from the government's Farm Woodland Grant
Scheme,' she said.
'The grants almost covered the cost of planting,' said Lionel Hill. 'But up
until this year we have not been too bothered about cost as it started as a
hobby. Really we didn't even imagine it would grow into a business, but once
we started taking it seriously we knew it would be a few years before
business built up.
'However, if we carry on as we have been doing so far this year we shall
turn over about Pounds 45,000 by our year-end next January and that will
easily exceed the turnover of the farm.
'If we continue at the present rate I shall reduce the acreage given over to
stock - at present it is Charolais cattle and Suffolk sheep and a little
feed - and increase the biomass land. We are already going to plant another
15 acres of willow and poplar this year.
'From the business point of view the next five years will be the most
important for the biomass crops. We have to be careful not to rest on our
laurels. The game now is to keep finding sources of new clones - currently
we have 60 clones of willow and 27 of poplar - to buy in and experiment
with.
'Speed of tree growth is all-important in this business. I am predicting
that other growers will catch up with us after five years, so we must make
the most of our lead now by selling all we can. When the big companies start
buying into set-aside land for growing biomass, or some of the big farmers
get going, we shall not be able to compete. So we must now go flat out to
develop our market.
'My guess is that as growers we shall be out of it in five years. I shall be
62 by then and I will probably finish up as a consultant. But it's going to
be a very interesting five years.'
By 1992 the Hills had built up 20 outlets for sales of mainly unrooted
cuttings and rods. The current number of outlets is 80.
'It's all happening with willow - and its all so new,' Hill said. 'Who
knows, the way things are going there might be whole buildings constructed
from willow, in which case I reckon I shall still be in a growth market.'

FT  11 JUN 94 / Computing: Win control of accounts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN BROOKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Research carried out by a leading bank last year showed that about half of
Britain's small businesses had a computer. Though no figures are available,
from my own experiences, many businesses use computers only for word
processing.
Recently, one business delayed my appointment by two days because the owner
and his secretary needed the time to complete the VAT returns.
What a waste of resources. There are hundreds of computer accounting
packages available today. Each targets a specific market. They range from
multi-user, multi-module offerings that run on mainframe computers down to
simple budgeting software written for a wide variety of home computers.
I asked myself: 'Why didn't they use a computer and accounts software?'
The opening sentence of one book on the subject suggests that 'making good
use of accountancy software within your business is not difficult as long as
you have good software and a reasonable understanding of accountancy
practice'.
Today, many new enterprises are started by people made redundant by large
companies cutting back on their workforce. Their understanding of
accountancy practice consists of a smart-suited accountant arriving in a
large car and accompanied by a fat fee.
The trend in accounts software is to make them simple. Software developers
are stripping away the accountancy jargon and referring to items in everyday
terms.
The advertising for the latest contender to enter the PC accounts market,
Visual Accounts, sums it up: 'No ledgers, no journals, no postings, no
problems]'
Money Manager has been the front-runner in simple accounts software, with
thousands of copies sold to small businesses and home users. It is often
castigated by reviewers in the computer press for being too simple.
But Money Manager works under MS-Dos and today appears old-fashioned. I
believe that Visual Accounts will take over a portion of Money Manager's
market because it runs under Windows.
Entering data into Visual Accounts takes no more time than writing the same
details into a cash analysis book. The benefits include the ability to print
an invoice by pressing a couple of keys, and the dreaded quarterly VAT
return will take only a few minutes.
The owner also gains instant access to more information about his business;
income and expenditure for the past month, quarter, or year; instant
balances in different accounts and aged debtors and creditors.
Money Manager and Visual Accounts are not the strongest accounts packages
for the PC but they are the simplest to use, with Visual Accounts possibly
having the edge. Neither package has facilities for stock control. Neither
would be suitable for a business with a substantial annual turnover.
Nevertheless, they would help many owners gain control of their business
rather than the business running their lives.

FT  11 JUN 94 / Food and Drink: A hearty start to the day - Great British
Eating / Nicholas Lander enjoys a filling and traditional breakfast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An American businessman asked a London taxi driver to take him to
Charterhouse Street in the City. Trying to engage his fare in conversation,
the cabbie asked how long the man was staying. 'Not long,' came the reply
'in fact I have just come for breakfast at the Fox &amp; Anchor.'
For the past 100 years the Fox &amp; Anchor has enjoyed a thriving breakfast
trade because of its proximity to early-opening Smithfield meat market. With
a market trading licence, which allows it to sell alcohol outside normal
licensing hours, the pub has been able to serve pints of beer alongside
breakfasts big enough to satisfy the beefiest meat porter.
Smithfield's decline has led to a change in demand. Instead of serving
breakfast at 4am the Fox &amp; Anchor now opens at 7am to serve breakfast and
lunch to those who carry nothing heavier than a briefcase and word
processor. It still serves pints of beer, of course. As we breakfasted, five
young City slickers were meeting in the pub's back room for their 'power
breakfast' and a pint of Guinness.
It seems ironic that demand for the great British breakfast - bacon,
sausage, black pudding, mushrooms, tomatoes and eggs any way you like them -
should prosper because we have now imported the breakfast meeting. Ironic
and slightly comical because nothing could be more difficult than eating
such food - trying to ensure that the fried egg does not drip down your
shirt front - while discussing the finer points of a complicated contract.
Although it is now much easier to buy top quality ingredients for the great
British breakfast (see the accompanying panel), and not suffer watery bacon
or fatty sausage, the meal itself is no less difficult to prepare. Nothing
can be cooked in advance - and no ingredient should be cooked for long.
Getting the timing of these items right is difficult - particularly if you
like your toast hot. Ask any father who, on Mother's Day, has offered to
take over in the kitchen.
I was consoled, therefore, when I turned to the gurus of the great British
breakfast, Francis Coulson and Brian Sack, of Sharrow Bay Hotel in Cumbria,
to hear that, even after 40 years of preparing and supervising breakfast,
the meal is not as simple as it looks.
What makes Sharrow Bay's breakfasts memorable - and two years ago it was
voted the best in the Francophile Relais &amp; Chateaux group - is a combination
of the best ingredients and attention to detail. Coulson's initial advice
was not strictly for the amateur cook: preparing the breakfast at Sharrow
Bay is not deemed a job for trainee chefs. There is always a head chef at
the stove, a commis to assist and a third on either toast and marmalade duty
 -the kitchen makes 1,500lbs of jam and marmalade a year.
Apart from natural pride in the quality of Cumberland sausage and local
black pudding, Coulson also insists on local grilled bacon, or Danish half
back, croutons fried in bacon fat and a fried apple ring as an essential
accompaniment to bacon and sausage.
But cooking all these ingredients to perfection is, according to Coulson,
only a part of the challenge in serving breakfast. Gauging the mood of your
customers is almost as difficult.
There are those who want to be greeted warmly, engaged in conversation about
the weather and plans for the day and those who want to be merely shown to a
table and left alone until the third cup of black coffee. Separating the
chatty from the grumpy is a sensitive task for the waiting staff.
Today, the great British breakfast may have become something of an
anachronism for several reasons including health ones. But, if it is cooked
well and served promptly, it can still be a great meal, the ideal
preparation for a strenuous day out - and excellent value too. My breakfast
at the Fox &amp; Anchor - bacon, tomatoes, egg, black pudding, sausages, fried
bread (only spoilt by some distinctly unBritish baked beans) cost Pounds
6.50 and was so filling that I happily skipped lunch.

FT  11 JUN 94 / Food and Drink: Tastes of paradise: smells of hell - Kieran
Cooke samples a fruit with all the aroma of cleaning-out time at a chicken
shed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE

<TEXT>
Hurley dug his way round Britain. One evening in the dim recesses of a
Norwich pub I am sure I saw him strike a match on the palm of his sandpaper
hand.
Hurley and durians belong to each other. The durian is the king of
south-east Asia's fruits. It is big, spiky and ugly. Inside its thick skin
the flesh round the seeds - the edible part of the fruit - tastes like
Camembert with sunstroke.
But it is the smell that distinguishes the durian from any other living
thing - except Hurley.
Hurley, who spent the main part of the day up to his haunches in
water-filled ditches, had terrible problems with his socks. No washing
machine could keep his feet in decent order.
One day Hurley thought he had found the solution to his problems. A local
store advertised indestructible socks - expensive items but guaranteed to
withstand all manner of abuse.
Down went Hurley and bought a pair. He gave them an exhaustive road test,
wearing them for a week, day and night.
On the seventh day holes as big as onions appeared in the heels. Hurley and
I went back to the store. 'Put your eyes on them things,' said Hurley,
slapping the socks, now looking like pieces of malnourished seaweed, on the
counter. 'Indestructible you say. I want my money back.'
Whenever I catch the whiff of a durian that moment returns.
The poor salesgirl gagged. Passing shoppers swooned. Feeling nauseous myself
I persuaded Hurley to accept the offer of a silk tie in exchange for his
faulty indestructibles.
The smell of durians is so pungent that hotels, airlines and bus operators
forbid them. Like cheap perfume in a hot dressing room, the smell can linger
for days. It is the odour of over-ripe compost, it is cleaning-out time at
the chicken sheds.
Yet at the mention of durians the eyes of the average resident of south-east
Asia go wild with desire. Lips salivate. There are groans of ecstasy. There
are few more sensual scenes than a party of young and old sitting around
gorging themselves on durians, faces splattered with the fruit's golden
flesh, seeds licked as clean as marbles.
Hew Choy Sam has a durian orchard in the Malaysian state of Perak. A founder
member of Malaysia's first durian growers association, Hew is a self
confessed durian addict.
'There is something very strange about durians. Just put two of them on a
stall by the road and everyone wants to stop and smell and chat. People are
obsessed with them: they search all their lives for the perfect one.'
There are heated arguments over where the best durians come from. Thailand
is the biggest producer. But Malaysians say the Thais have allowed durian
production to become too commercial. Thai durians keep longer because they
are harvested while still hanging on the tree. Hew says durians must be
allowed to drop. Only then is the flesh guaranteed moist and ripe.
'The Thais are even trying to produce an odourless durian so it can be
exported,' says an indignant Hew. 'You can't take the smell out of durians.
For us it is nearly as important as the taste.'
A terrible vision of eating Hurley's socks comes to mind.
Durians are temperamental fruits which are easily infected by pests and
disease. They also command premium prices - a good, highly pungent durian
full of fleshy seeds can fetch up to MDollars 40 (Pounds 10).
There are durian cowboys who sell dud durians to unsuspecting customers.
Durian rustling is common.
During harvesting season Hew, a sprightly 65-year-old, moves his bed out to
his orchard to guard his crop. 'Through the night I count the thuds as
durians hit the ground. It is a lovely sound.'
Hew and his friends think nothing of driving hundreds of miles in search of
the perfect durian. Fruits are tasted with the same diligence as wines are
sipped at a French auction.
The durian has its own mythology. It aids circulation but increases blood
pressure. It is good for the complexion but causes gout. It must never be
eaten with alcohol. It is an aphrodisiac but also creates chronic wind.
When the durian tree has finished dispensing its smelly pleasures to the
world the wood is used for making clogs.
An ideal present for Hurley.

FT  11 JUN 94 / Cookery: Summer treats
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Is it really June? Given the treacherous nature of the weather, wise cooks
will hedge their bets by choosing foods that can be served hot or cold
equally well.
Asparagus, which should be at its best just now, is a prime candidate. It is
quick to cook and can be served straight from the pan, sauced with hot,
melted butter to hearten the chilly. More adventurously, asparagus stalks
can be grilled or roasted and sprinkled with toasted sesame seeds or grated
Parmesan.
If the temperature soars, cool the stalks briefly after cooking and dress
them lightly with a fresh herb vinaigrette instead, or with a parsley and
coriander pesto that has been diluted seriously.
Shrimps and prawns with their summery, seaside connotations are also adept
at beating the weather. Freshly-boiled little brown shrimps are best for
flavour - or is nostalgic memory playing me false?
Easier to track down than fresh shrimps are Baxter's potted variety (to
order direct, tel: 0524-410910). A few tubs stashed in the freezer bring
enormous reassurance. Serve the classic way, with wedges of lemon and lots
of toast.
I also like to spoon a few potted shrimps into the bottom of ramekins for
oeufs en cocottes a la creme; or to stir them into a delicate cream and fish
stock bechamel for a satisfyingly simple shrimp sauce to spoon over fillets
of sole or turbot.
Large cold-water prawns and the tails of Dublin Bay prawns are easier to buy
raw than they were. Like potted shrimps, they are useful to keep in the
freezer. Defrosted, painted with oil and seasoned with sea salt and black
pepper, they take hardly any time to sizzle on a griddle or to stir-fry.
When the shells have turned from blue-grey to pink and the air is tinged
with an agreeable whiff of the sea, add a little chopped garlic, ginger and
spring onions for an oriental finishing touch; or lime and chillies for a
Mexican slant; or a handful of basil or a few seeds of fennel and coriander
for a Mediterranean flavour.
Serve the prawns hot in a nest of noodles or rice, with the pan juices
poured over, or serve them just as they are with plenty of good bread to mop
up the juices.
If the weather plays fair, let the cooked prawns become cold and serve them
on a suitable salad bed with a sesame sauce for dipping; or a spicy tomato
and green coriander salsa; or a bowl of saffron-flavoured mayonnaise.
Uncurling the flesh from the shells is messy but fun, appealing to primitive
picnicker instincts, and sucking the shells at the end is the best part of
all, for the shell is where the sweetest flavour lies. Finger bowls and
large mini tablecloth sized napkins are advisable. Here is a good way to
serve prawns and asparagus in tandem:
ASPARAGUS RICE WITH PRAWNS (serves 6)
I have written this recipe for serving hot. But for hot-weather eating, the
dish can be served cold equally well. In that case, though, I suggest using
olive oil rather than butter to anoint the rice. And instead of Hollandaise
or Bearnaise sauce to partner the dish, I would hand round a bowl of
tarragon-flavoured mayonnaise thinned to the consistency of pouring cream by
beating in yoghurt, fromage frais or soured cream. Another good - and less
rich - sauce is a fresh tomato coulis.
Ingredients:  3/4 lb basmati rice; 1 1/2 lb asparagus; 2 to 3 dozen raw
tails of Dublin Bay prawns; 5 to 6 inches of cucumber; a little butter; a
large pinch of sugar; a splash of tarragon vinegar; 1 or 2 tablespoons of
olive oil; half a lemon.
A 3pt ring mould is needed for this recipe. The rice is moulded in it and
used as a 'vase' to contain a king-size bunch of short lengths of asparagus.
Method: Scrape or peel the asparagus stalks, discarding the woody bases of
the stems. Then cut the stems down to a length suitable for standing upright
in the middle of the ring of rice, and chop the trimmings into pea-size
pieces. These tender trimmings can be used to stud the rice and flavour it
deliciously.
Peel and seed the cucumber. Dice the flesh into pea-size pieces, toss with
the sugar, tarragon vinegar and a pinch of salt and set aside for five
minutes or so.
Drop the cucumber into a large pan of heavily-salted water and boil for a
minute or so. Fish the cucumber out of the pan and pat it dry. Then drop the
diced asparagus trimmings into the same water and cook until just tender.
Remove and pat dry, reserving the cooking liquor.
Let the rice soak in cold salted water while the vegetables are cooking.
Then drain it and boil it in the water in which the cucumber and asparagus
were cooked so that it benefits from the build-up of flavours.
When the rice is just cooked, drain it and refresh it under a cold, running
tap. Drain again, season well, and stir in the chopped and cooked
vegetables. Mix and bind with up to 1oz of cool, melted butter, pack the
mixture into the lightly-buttered ring mould, and cover with buttered foil.
Everything up to this stage can be done well ahead.
To re-heat the rice for serving, stand the mould in a roasting tin
containing enough freshly-boiled water to come halfway up the sides of the
mould, and slip the tin into an oven heated to 375`F/190`C (gas mark 5) for
about 15 minutes until the rice is hot.
Meanwhile, boil or steam the asparagus and prepare the prawns. Season them
with sea salt, pepper and a good squeeze of lemon and toss them in enough
olive oil to make the shells glisten all over. Heat a wok or a large saute
pan thoroughly. Add the prepared prawns and saute or stir-fry, turning them
until the shells are pink and the flesh is hot and cooked right through.
Let the prawns rest in the pan while you un-mould the ring of rice on to a
flat, warmed dish, blot the asparagus dry, and stand it in the ring. Arrange
the prawns all around the rice and pour their pan juices over the rice.
Serve with good bread and the sauce of your choice.

FT  11 JUN 94 / Food and Drink: Good value fizz - Appetisers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANCIS ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Like manufacturing Easter eggs, winemaking is basically a part-time job. A
month of frenetic activity punctuates an otherwise relatively tranquil
existence. Hence flying winemakers who commute between hemispheres to double
their vintage experience, and hence so many winemakers' secret ambitions to
experiment with more demanding wine styles such as fortified and sparkling
wines, writes Jancis Robinson.
It is no surprise, therefore, to come across Maison La Motte, a vivaciously
sparkling version of James Herrick's still Chardonnay from his three
vineyards in the Languedoc, on sale at Pounds 7.99 at Safeway and Victoria
Wine. Given its sparkle in the Loire by the traditional champagne method, it
shows that Limoux does not have the southern French monopoly on good value
fizz.
The Savoie sparkling winemaking business Varichon et Clerc proves the same
point, more clumsily but much more cheaply, with its Sparkling Chardonnay on
sale at Asda for Pounds 4.99. This is also southern French fruit, but given
its sparkle in the Alpine foothills.
Much better buys from Asda, however, come from Limoux but are not Limoux's
most famous product, Blanquette (soon to be Cremant) de Limoux. The
charming, still red Pinot Noir, Vin de Pays 1992 at just Pounds 3.75 is a
steal for a lightly oaked, flattering wine designed to be drunk, not too
warm, this very day.
Also definitively a summer wine is Asda's Blanquette Methode Ancestrale
Pounds 3.99, another true bargain from Limoux. This is the most traditional
form of sparkling wine - despite the EU's insistence that those made by the
champagne method be labelled 'traditional method' - left sweetish and
lightly fizzing with, traditionally, the sediment from the second
fermentation in bottle still lurking in the bottle.
It would be unreasonable to expect a supermarket to live with as
frighteningly natural a thing as sediment, so it has been removed, by
disgorgement a la champenoise, but the wine would make a genuinely
delightful appley aperitif or light pudding wine with something not too
sweet such as strawberries.
English winemakers are also increasingly putting sparkle in their wines,
partly to boost their selling price and partly because the cool summers (and
some soils) of England can be remarkably like those of Champagne. Heritage
English Sparkling from the Thames valley via Safeway and Victoria Wine at
Pounds 7.99 has nice lees-aged aromas, a little bit of bite, and does not
have a great deal of gas.
The process of ageing sparkling wine on its yeast lees to give it that
special character is still far from fully understood, but champagne giants
Moet &amp; Chandon have been working on it. Their most communicative winemaker
Richard Geoffroy was in London this week to divulge the results. Science
backs up our palates in demonstrating that it works best on the classic
Champagne grapes Pinot and Chardonnay, if kept on the lees preferably for at
least five years, and cannot be used to add class to essentially poor wine.
But his real bombshell was the news, after all these years, that champagne
bottles are probably best stored upright rather than horizontal. Champagne
corks are quite different animals, expected to do a quite different job,
from still wine corks, and the less the wine is in contact with them, the
better apparently.
In this new spirit of openness, Moet &amp; Chandon is launching its new
non-vintage Brut Imperial in Britain this month, based on wines from the
superb 1990 crop, with a smart back label spelling out this fact, together
with percentage of reserve wines (17) and the varietal composition of the
blend. Bravo] And the wine itself is a worthy emissary too.
Those looking for a more obscure champagne-with-a-story could do worse than
Gatinois NV, Pounds 181.80 a case or Pounds 16.80 a bottle from Haynes
Hanson &amp; Clark on 071-376 2737. The deputy mayor of Ay sells most of his
grapes to Bollinger but produces wines like this powerfully flavoured, Pinot
Noir-dominated blend with the rest of the produce from his seven hectares of
grand cru vineyards.
J. Sainsbury is doing its bit to drain the European wine lake by launching a
pair of Sicilian wines, on special offer for the next two weeks at Pounds
1.99 (usual price Pounds 2.69). The red is aquiver with acidity and did not
appeal to me as much as the white, a relatively robust, lively blend of
Trebbiano with Italy's most planted grape variety, Catarratto. JR
Wine collectors are spoilt for choice in London next week with sales at
Sotheby's and Christie's. Sotheby's sale on Wednesday includes the cellar
from Boulestin's restaurant. Details and catalogue on 071-408 5051. Jill
James
To clarify last week's item about the private cellar being offered at
Christie's (071-839 9060) in London on Thursday. The 1947 Cheval Blanc,
mentioned as being of special interest, is expected to fetch Pounds 10,000
to Pounds 15,000 per dozen and it is the sale's two super lots which are
estimated at Pounds 200,000 to Pounds 300,000 each. There will be mixed lots
ranging in estimate from as little as Pounds 80.

FT  11 JUN 94 / How To Spend It: Surviving the summer - A look at the ordeal
of outdoor events
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Whatever happened to global warming? I had, rather unsportingly, been
looking forward to it and was even having visions of vineyards and peaches
growing from Land's End to John O'Groats, of suntanned limbs and of wearing
one's favourite summer outfit more than once a year in England.
Last weekend, which saw the opening sallies in the set-piece rituals of the
British summer season, presented a sorrier picture. At Louis Vuitton's
Concours d'Elegance, at Hurlingham, west London, on Saturday night, the
woman from Tatler was wearing a new Karl Lagerfeld jacket. Not that many
noticed since it was hidden under a woolly duffle coat. The Daily
Telegraph's reporter's dress was edged with mud. Icy winds nipped at the
shins and at one (very chic but outdoor) table all the guests had shivered
off by 9.30pm. The jolly parting cry as we all said goodnight was 'See you
in St Thomas's'
At Smith's Lawn, Windsor, Alfred Dunhill gave us lunch in a windproof
marquee and wrapped us in soft navy-blue rugs for polo-watching, while piles
of umbrellas stood at the ready. It is true that none of this is compulsory
 -so why do we do it? It seems almost a badge of nationhood. Forget Norman
Tebbit's cricket test, the real test of nationality is the ability to
survive the British outdoor summer event with aplomb.
As I write, the rain is still pouring, it is neither cold enough for winter
coats nor warm enough for one's gladdest rags - yet most of the season's
rites lie ahead. So for those determined to attend set-piece events, here
are my tips on how to make them bearable . . .
There are some sensitive souls who, it seems, are unable to enjoy themselves
unless their pooch is happy, too. For them, some far-seeing manufacturer in
France has devised the ultimate doggy treat - the canine hamper. There is a
waterproofed blanket to protect delicate bones from damp or chilly grass, a
stainless steel bowl to provide a soothing container for canine nosh, a
brush to shine up the coat and a bone to keep boredom at bay. It costs
Pounds 249 from Asprey 165-169 New Bond Street, London W1.
For timing your laps around the park, or the horses in a race, a stop-watch
is essential. This one is shock resistant, weighs very little (less than
2oz), and, it is claimed, is laser-tuned to make it accurate to 1/100th of a
second. Pounds 23.50 (Pounds 1.50 p+p) from The Conran Shop.
Umbrellas are essential, if only to make sure that it does not rain. At
Ascot, no logos are allowed so keep it plain. Most traditional examples come
from James Smith &amp; Co, 53 New Oxford Street, London WC1 but Liberty has some
stunning ones, with the collection by Siobhan O'Neill deserving special
mention (we featured one with a spectacular see-through perspex handle a few
weeks ago, Pounds 70). Jean-Paul Gaultier has a stunning brolly with a
double layer of printed fabric and netting (Pounds 135). Should the sun
shine and you need more of a parasol than an umbrella, Chantal Thomass
offers one that is very My Fair Lady in white with lots of frills (Pounds
75). If your tastes run more to black and white and the surreal then there
is a Fornasetti version at Pounds 69.
No outdoor sporting event should be embarked upon without a rug. Smartest
(and most expensive) are at Asprey, 165-169 New Bond Street, London W1 where
they come in delicious Paisley patterns and have neat little leather handles
to hold it rolled up (Pounds 210). Cheaper at Brora, 7a Filmer Road Studios,
75 Filmer Road, London SW6, where 6ft x 5ft, 52oz tartan wool rugs sell at
Pounds 55 each or Pounds 99 for a pair. You can find cheaper still at
Evergreen (Dept A/J, Albert Mills, Bradford Road, Batley Carr, Dewsbury,
West Yorkshire) where 72in x 54in fringed rugs made from recycled fibres (95
per cent wool, 5 per cent other fibres) are Pounds 24.99 (p+p Pounds 2.50).
Practical at Flectalon, which has produced a rug which doubles as a picnic
bag - an insulated bag capable of holding 25 litres - can be unzipped to
become a 6ft 6in x 4ft 8in rug, waterproof backed (Pounds 58.75, John Lewis
partnership stores and the General Trading Company, 144 Sloane Street,
London SW1 or tel: 0443-843717 for nearest stockist).
Even on the bleakest of picnics the white wine should be chilled. The Ice
Wrap, a velcro fastened wrap-around pack with a pocket to hold the frozen
gel (which should be kept at the ready in a freezer) will cool a bottle in
under half an hour and keep it that way for up to eight hours. Pounds 7.99
by Flectalon. For stockists, see above.
Binoculars - beg, borrow or buy whether you are going to Wimbledon (lovely
for celebrity spotting and following that forehand), cricket, Henley, Ascot
or Cowes. When buying, remember the best optics these days are very
expensive so there is no substitute for carefully assessing what best suits
your own eyes. Try a grand name (Leitz, Zeiss) first as a benchmark against
which you can test less expensive versions.
Above: keep track of the cricket Test score with a solar-powered radio and
you need never worry about your batteries running low. Do not worry too much
about the 'solar' - it also responds to ordinary daylight and electric
light.
It costs Pounds 18.95 (plus Pounds 1.75 p+p) from The Conran Shop.
Cartier-Bresson would not be excited but the Action Tracker camera is
designed to provide a little fun when outdoors.
It takes four sequential shots which come out on the same print - good for
analysing golf swings, or photographing the finish of a race. It takes a
normal 35mm film but you must remember to ask the developers to print the
whole of the negative.
It costs Pounds 11.50 (p+p Pounds 1.50) from The Conran Shop, 81 Fulham
Road, London SW3 6RD.
Above and left: portable TVs. If you have seats on court number 14 and you
want to follow the action on the centre court or if you are at Henley and
cannot bear to miss the Wimbledon finals, then a portable TV is essential.
Casio offers at least five models, of which the cheapest is the TV-480 which
has a 2.2in screen and auto tuning for Pounds 109.99.
Best of all is the TV-7100 which has a reversible detachable sun hood so you
get a clear picture even when watching out of doors. The colour screen is
3.3ins and it costs Pounds 219.99.
Pictured above is the Hanro vest. There are thermal vests and thermal vests.
The Hanro is the state-of-the-art apogee of the genre - with prices to
match.
There are necklines and sleevelines to accommodate almost every dress that
is decent (V-necked, round-necked, spaghetti-strapped, short-sleeved,
sleeveless and long-sleeved). The finest knitted silk is the warmest. Prices
range from about Pounds 27 to Pounds 37.50, depending upon the style. They
are widely available from good department stores such as Fenwick of Bond
Street.
For a local stockist, tel: 071-245 6231
Calver &amp; Wilson does gorgeous things with velvet, primarily aimed at winter
party goers. Given that outdoors at Hurlingham, Glyndebourne or Clonter
Opera is likely to be a lot colder than anything held indoors in December,
why not order one of their sumptuous velvet capes now? They need two weeks'
notice, most people order them in black with a jewel-colour contrasting
lining, but any other colour is available. They cost Pounds 390 and should
see you glamorously through a life-time of shivering summer evenings. Tel:
071-724 6771.
Toosh, Shahtoosh and Pashmina shawls, made from the finest grades of
cashmere, are investment garments. They are the shawls that slip through a
wedding ring and are so soft, so warm and so light that they are the perfect
evening cover-up. Although they cost a great deal, (prices range from Pounds
500 to more than Pounds 1,000, depending on the grade and the quality) they
are completely understated. The shawls come in three grades with Pashmina
wool - combed from the underbellies of goats that live in the mountains of
Kashmir - being the least expensive. Then comes Shahtoosh, combed from goat
chin and underbelly and, finally, Toosh, the finest quality, combed only
from under the throat of the goat.
All the shawls are in plain colours - soft brown, indigo, dark russet red
and black - but they can be embellished with simple bands of silk
embroidery.
Madeleine Trehearne, an English academic who knows India well, imports the
shawls in small quantities and sells them from her home. Contact her on
071-435 6310.

FT  11 JUN 94 / Fashion: Men who dress to suit - Richard Rawlinson urges
British men to lighten up this summer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD RAWLINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The long-standing reputation of British gents for sartorial elegance is
marred by one thing - they do not seem to distinguish between summer and
winter clothes for the office. Their formal wardrobe is one of the few
remaining parts of their heritage which commands respect from mainland
European and American counterparts.
Those foreigners prone to mocking the fashion sense of British women (along
with the nation's alleged taste for pork scratchings and warm beer) often
wax lyrical about British men's restrained style.
Indeed, Prince Charles often features on the annual best-dressed man list in
France, and many international executives make a bee-line for Savile Row's
tailors when they visit London. Clothing brands such as Burberry, Dunhill
and Aquascutum have thriving export businesses, selling le style anglais
across Europe, the US and Japan.
Overseas social observers, however, have detected one risible flaw in the
way the British gent dresses himself. While they have no quarrel with his
idiosyncratic penchant for mixing pin-stripe suits with loud, stripey shirts
and busy, paisley-patterned ties, they are baffled by his tendency to wear
thick, flannel suits and heavy brogues in temperatures over 70`F.
British men do not seem to acknowledge climatic changes. From June to
August, it is commonplace to see British business executives, in
charcoal-grey worsted wool suits and solid Oxford shoes, wiping sweat from
their brows as soon as they leave their air-conditioned offices. And tweedy
country solicitors, attending drinks parties after work on sticky summer
evenings, look distinctly hot under the collar as they gulp Pimms on garden
terraces.
'Some British men even wear overcoats in summer]' says Roland Klein, a
French designer who has made London his home. He adds: 'The British seem to
think lightweight clothes are too relaxed for the office. Some men are also
probably too economical to justify separate summer and winter wardrobes.'
It does not have to be this way. Technological advances in cloth
manufacturing mean lightweight suits are not necessarily inappropriate for
the office. Gone are the days when a summer suit conjured up images of
shiny, sky blue jacket and trousers or unstructured, unlined, crumpled cream
linen.
Brioni, an Italian menswear company, is regarded as a pioneer of the
lightweight suit. Throughout the 1950s, when most men still settled for
coarsely-woven, bulky, utilitarian demob suits, Brioni offered luxurious
suits in the lightest of wools and with minimum padding.
The Rome-based tailor uses a cloth known as Vaticani, so called because the
Pope's red cassocks are made from it. Graded (in technical parlance) from a
fine 'super 100' to a deluxe and rare 'super 150', the same fabric is also
popular with orchestral conductors who need to remain cool during energetic
performances.
Retail stockists of Brioni include Beale and Inman in London's New Bond
Street, where off-the-peg suits range from Pounds 1,100 to Pounds 1,900 and
custom-made suits from Pounds 3,500 to Pounds 4,000.
The beauty of the tightly-woven merino wool and fine cashmere is that they
are cool in summer, yet warm in winter. Clothes made from them often have
all-year appeal, prompting the term 'trans-seasonal' fashion. The investment
in top-quality fabrics also means the clothes are likely to be thoroughly
comfortable, durable and resistant to creases when in a suitcase.
The Italians have always been ahead of the game when it comes to
understanding the importance of fabric in menswear. Giorgio Armani, Cerruti
and Ermengildo Zegna all are maestros of smooth, textural, trans-seasonal
attire; indeed, it is no coincidence that the latter two began as textile
manufacturers.
Since they emerged on the UK menswear scene in the 1980s, they have had a
profound influence on the way traditional British brands, such as Austin
Reed and Jaeger, use fabric. But while their shift away from heavy cloth has
rubbed off on younger men, the more mature and conservative British gent
remains obstinately loyal to his heavy suit, perhaps equating weight with
quality.
Many UK brands are using a lightweight, supple wool which has been devised
and promoted by the International Wool Secretariat and has the trademark
Cool Wool.
For this spring and summer, Daks Simpson is offering navy and grey
three-button, single-breasted and doubled-breasted suits in cool wool woven
into a super 100 gabardine. Prices range from Pounds 229 to Pounds 375.
Aquascutum has experimented with making sober-coloured cool wool suits. Its
charcoal cloth has a thin gold pin-stripe while the navy fabric has a fine
rust stripe. Its range of shirts often has short sleeves and its silk ties
are brighter than the winter collection.
Burberry presents lightweight, crease-free, wool gabardine suits in navy,
mushroom and khaki, while its shirts come in soft white, cream, lemon, mint
and sky blue.
Dunhill's suits have become increasingly informal in cut and fabrication in
recent seasons and, this summer, it offers wool and linen mixes in light
grey.
Merchandise director Alan Duddle says: 'Men have become used to wearing
comfortable casual wear on weekends, and they are becoming intolerant of
having to wear restrictive suits for work. Menswear is getting more
relaxed.'
All these brands are dabbling, to various degrees, in the crumpled,
earthy-coloured linen garments promoted so strongly on the international
designer catwalks for this season. But they realise also that this extremely
informal look would not be acceptable in many offices.
They are, therefore, combining the comfort of lightweight suits with the
conservative looks of heavier tailoring, to give men the best of both.

FT  11 JUN 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Deductions from a fund
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I have a holding in a Luxembourg-based bond fund. At the beginning of last
year, it introduced a small annual charge which it applied by deducting
units, equivalent to the charge, from my holding.
I have no complaint with this but I wonder how I should deal with it when
calculating my liability to CGT now I have sold the holding.
2. Looking to the future, Crest (the proposed new stock exchange settlement
system) will force most private shareholders to use nominee accounts. If the
annual charges for such accounts are levied directly on shareholders, how
should these charges be dealt with in capital gains tax calculations?
3. Could you recommend a readable book giving information on trusts
established by a will?
First, each deduction of units from the holding is treated as though it were
a sale of the units in question for a consideration equal to the charges
which the deduction covered.
2. They should be ignored.
3. Try the tax and trust books in your local reference library.
Probably all you need bear in mind, however, is that discretionary trusts
tend to carry a higher ultimate tax bill than interest-in-possession trusts,
and that accumulation trusts generally carry the highest tax burden.

FT  11 JUN 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Dividend is missing
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I hold 337 Type 1 shares and 67 Type 2 shares in CESC Ltd, Calcutta, India,
on which a dividend of 20 per cent was declared on September 21 1992.
Despite numerous air mail letters, I have received nothing in respect of
this dividend. It appears that I am unable to sell these shares through a
bank or building society as they do not deal in Indian securities.
Since I am precluded from the receipt of dividends or the sale of the
security, will the Inland Revenue accept this as a capital loss for capital
gains tax purposes?
You should write to your local inspector of taxes at the Inland Revenue to
ask if your holding in CESC is available as a capital loss to offset your
gains elsewhere. (Answer by Murray Johnstone Personal Asset Management).

FT  11 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family: Loans threat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA ELLIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Higher-rate taxpayers should beware of mortgage lenders bearing gifts,
writes Barbara Ellis. A recent Inland Revenue opinion suggests that
fashionable mortgage cashback offers to new borrowers might be subject to
capital gains tax.
Several building societies have been using lump sum cash payments as an
alternative to interest rate discounts to woo new borrowers into signing up
for standard variable-rate mortgages and wean them off fixed-rate loans. But
borrowers inquiring about the tax implications have had little help from
lenders.
Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, for example, just prints a warning which says: 'We
are unable to confirm whether or not a cash gift will be subject to tax. You
should contact your tax office . . .'
Within the past week, however, C&amp;G has had a letter from officials at West
Midlands I tax district. It suggests that, in the Revenue's opinion, the C&amp;G
mortgage cash was a capital sum derived from a contractual right and would,
therefore, be liable to CGT. But C&amp;G intends to argue that the money should
be exempt from tax as a gift.
The biggest problem appears to lie with higher-rate taxpayers, since they
may do better from cash gifts than low borrowing rates. C&amp;G's figures show
that a borrower taking out a Pounds 40,000 mortgage and opting for the gift
would pay interest at 7.64 per cent - Pounds 2,598 in the first year, net of
Pounds 458 mortgage interest relief.
The cash gift of Pounds 1,200 would bring net outgoings on the mortgage loan
to Pounds 1,398. By comparison, a borrower choosing the C&amp;G discounted
interest rate of 4.64 per cent would pay Pounds 1,578 net of mortgage
interest relief.
In absolute terms, the difference is just Pounds 180. But this advantage
could be wiped out if capital gains tax were charged on the gift.

FT  11 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family: Think ahead on gilts - What to do as
redemption time nears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DYSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Most gilt-edged securities have set redemption dates when the government
pays back investors. This week, for instance, Treasury 10 per cent 1994 was
repaid. In August, Pounds 1.24bn of Exchequer 12.5 per cent 1994 (issued in
1977) will be repaid, followed in November by Pounds 1.9bn of Treasury 9 per
cent 1994 (issued in 1969).
If you have either, you should be thinking already of what to do. You can
either hold them to redemption and seek a new home for the money, or sell in
the market now and re-invest while gilt yields are high and prices
depressed.
If you hold to redemption, you will get the Pounds 100 face value of the
stock with no brokerage costs. But if you sell in the market now, you might
well get slightly more; at mid-week, the bid price (what a seller receives)
was Pounds 101.5.
The extra 1.5 per cent should more than compensate for the fact that selling
through the market means investors have to pay a dealing commission.
The table includes some suggestions of stocks which might be suitable
replacements. All have pros and cons.
Gilts normally offer lower yields, as the payments are guaranteed. The stock
suggested here, Treasury 6 per cent 1999, has a relatively low income yield
but the return is good if held to redemption, with the net yields
particularly attractive. The 8 per cent 2003 is a good all-rounder.
The snag with Eurosterling bonds is that dealings are only in bearer form.
Royal offers a good yield if held to maturity. Alliance &amp; Leicester also has
a good yield but can be traded only in multiples of 10,000. The Fleming bond
is particularly suitable for offshore or gross income-seekers.
Permanent interest-bearing shares (Pibs) have one major drawback: they do
not have a redemption date. So, the only way you can get your money back is
by selling in the market, with no assurance of a good price. The yield on
the Britannia Pibs is good, and deals are possible in multiples of Pounds
1,000. Zero dividend preference shares offer no income as such but are
highly tax-efficient, with a good total return.
TR Technology is well covered with less than four years to run, while the
Fleming zero offers an excellent balance of low risk and reasonable reward -
but, of course, only if you hold it to maturity.

FT  11 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family: Down - but not yet out - What next
for C&amp;G and Lloyds?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After euphoria comes disappointment for most Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester
customers, who had been looking forward to generous pay-outs from the
building society's take-over by Lloyds bank.
Lloyds was to have paid C&amp;G Pounds 1.8bn in cash, which the society intended
to distribute among most of its 1.4m customers and staff.
All C&amp;G investing members would have been entitled to a bonus of 10 per cent
of the balance in their accounts once the deal was completed - providing
they had the account at March 31 1994 and held it to completion day. Voting
investors and all borrowers would have been entitled to a Pounds 500 cash
pay-out as well.
The plan was thrown into doubt when Sir Donald Nicholls ruled in the High
Court this week that Lloyds could not make cash payments to members who had
been investors for less than two years before December 31 1993. Investing
members are those with a share account such as Cheltenham Gold, London Share
or Instant 7.
The judgment also suggested that the society's borrowers - around 370,000 of
them - could not be paid at all unless they happened to have a share
account.
C&amp;G had wanted to give generously to its more recent investing members and
to its borrowers to ensure that the deal went through. It needs the
approval, in separate votes, of both types of member but it faces a
potential problem.
Since about 27 per cent of the society's 840,000 voting investors have been
with the society for less than two years, C&amp;G wanted to include them in its
distribution of sweeteners for fear of their scuppering the deal.
Customers of societies taken over by C&amp;G in the past two years - Heart of
England and Mid-Sussex - count as C&amp;G members providing they had been
members of their old societies since December 1991.
So, what should customers of Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester do now?
An FT straw poll in a Birmingham branch of C&amp;G after the judgment found many
disgruntled customers. But anger should not be a reason to consider leaving
the society.
There is no suggestion that the High Court has stopped the merger taking
place - simply that it objects to elements of its structure.
Lloyds says its bid still stands and C&amp;G is trying to come up with a new
structure acceptable both to its voting members and to the Building
Societies Commission. The commission's challenge to C&amp;G's original plan led
to the court hearing.
C&amp;G says it will be several weeks before it will be in a position to say
anything substantive. But it still wants to come up with a deal to benefit
all its members and staff and it might yet decide to appeal against the
ruling.
While C&amp;G is not commenting on the form a restructuring might take, analysts
have suggested:
Offering preference shares to all shareholders and borrowers, or offering
these shares to new members. It is unlikely that C&amp;G would be allowed to
offer shares which could be exchanged easily for cash.
Giving members of less than two years' standing some value for the surrender
of their voting rights.
Closing the society to new members until all had acquired at least two
years' standing.
Halting the growth of the society in this way would be a drastic step,
although C&amp;G has barred new customers from joining as it considers its
options.
It says that it will be closed only for a few days to stop people from
joining in the mistaken belief that they will be able to make money by doing
so.

FT  11 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family: Credit shake-up urged - A look at
OFT proposals to give consumers a better deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
New proposals by the Office of Fair Trading this week aim to simplify the
way that interest rates for credit, including mortgages, are quoted and
advertised. They also aim to give consumers a fairer deal if they repay
loans early.
Sir Bryan Carsberg, the director-general of fair trading, announced a
'spring clean' of the 1974 Consumer Credit Act so as to make consumer
protection rules relevant to present market conditions and get rid of
unnecessarily complicated regulation.
Central to his review was the question of annual percentage rates - APRs -
which are required by law to be shown for any form of credit. The APR
calculation involves such items as the actual interest rate, the way it is
applied, the timing of payments, all charges, and compulsory insurance.
This produces a single figure by which to compare different credit offers.
So, if one type of credit has a relatively high interest rate while another
has lower rates but high fixed charges, consumers can see which one actually
costs them less.
A survey by the OFT found that although few people had a very clear
understanding of what an APR actually was, most of them understood that a
lower APR generally meant a better credit deal.
The review proposed some changes. These are:
The three different methods of calculating APRs, as allowed in the 1980
Consumer Credit Regulations, should be reduced to one in line with an EC
directive on consumer credit.
APRs on all forms of 'running account' credit, such as credit and store
cards, should be based solely on interest rates, with fixed fees listed
separately.
This should reduce the distorting effect of annual fees, which have a
smaller impact the more you spend on a card. It will, however, mean that
comparing the cost of credit cards with other forms of credit will be more
difficult.
Credit card and store card APRs should assume an average outstanding balance
of Pounds 500, rather than Pounds 1,000 as now.
Two APRs should be listed for mortgages with an initial fixed or discounted
rate: one based on the initial rate and one, less prominently, based on the
lender's variable rate, to which the mortgage reverts when the special rate
runs out.
At present, lenders are allowed only to quote an APR based on the initial
rate, which might last for as little as one year.
APRs need not be given for credit deals under Pounds 150, and should be
replaced by precise information on repayments.
The upper limit for credit agreements regulated by the Consumer Credit Act
should be increased to Pounds 25,000 from Pounds 15,000, and the lower limit
should be increased to Pounds 150.
Another important change suggested was that the calculation of early
settlement costs should be made more equitable to borrowers, and it should
be made clear at the outset what the penalties were. An OFT survey found
that many borrowers were not aware there could be substantial penalties for
repaying loans early. Those quizzed felt the level of penalties often was
unjust.
Sir Bryan also called for greater 'transparency and choice' for home-buyers
who often are pushed into packaged mortgages where the loan is tied to an
endowment, sickness and redundancy insurance, or buildings and contents
insurance.
Sir Bryan said: 'There are clearly considerable pressures upon some
consumers to take tied-in services without their being able in practice to
assess the value of those services by shopping around.' He did not rule out
the possibility that some unscrupulous lenders were bamboozling borrowers
deliberately with unnecessarily complicated explanations.
Sir Bryan said lenders should provide clear information at an early stage on
what the mortgage package involved, and what the options were. But the
Consumers' Association pointed out that this would apply to only half the
market: mortgages arranged directly with the lender would be covered, but
not those arranged through intermediaries such as estate agents or mortgage
brokers.
The advertising of credit will also change if the OFT proposals are
implemented. The acres of small print at the bottom of newspaper
advertisements may shrink a little, to be replaced by clear information on
the most important points in readable type.
And we may no longer get the message: 'Your home is at risk if you do not
keep up payments on a mortgage or other loan secured on it' tacked on to the
end of radio advertisements, or running along the bottom of the screen in
tiny print on television advertisements.
Sir Bryan said that awareness of this message and what it meant was,
generally, wide. He felt that the transient nature of broadcast
advertisements made it irrelevant, but that it should stay for printed
advertisements.

FT  11 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family: Life insurance and you - Fifth in
Anthony Bailey's series on the true costs of investing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY BAILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Much publicity about the life insurance industry in recent years has been
for the wrong reasons. In particular, there have been worries that some
endowment policies taken out to pay off mortgages may not provide enough.
Then, too, there is evidence of widespread mis-selling, with many investors
getting very poor returns when they surrender policies before maturity.
Despite this, investment-based life insurance plans continue to be held
widely. Why?
Perhaps there is no mystery. Much of the life insurance industry's malaise
can be put down to the pressure on sales staff to sell their wares,
regardless of suitability or investment potential. For this, they can earn
huge commissions.
A 10-year policy with a monthly premium of Pounds 100 could earn a salesman
Pounds 400, and Pounds 850 on a 25-year policy - possibly a lot more. Yet,
paradoxically, commission is not the way to measure the cost of this form of
investment.
What matters just as much is a policy's overall costs - the money which is
not working for you.
In this context, you need to look at a company's overall expenses (of which
commission might form a part) or tot up specific charges (from which
commission is just one of the expenses paid).
Unit-linked polices
With unit-linked polices, at least charges are stated explicitly. But,
invariably, they are in the small print of the documents you get, and may
require close reading to discover exactly what they mean. Then, too, in
practice there is wide variation.
Here are some of the things to look for
The bid-offer spread is reasonably straightforward. The bid (selling) price
of a unit is usually set at 5 per cent lower than the offer (buying) price.
This is the price of entry into the fund - an initial charge.
The annual charge is also fairly easy on the brain. A percentage of the
value of your fund is deducted throughout the life of the policy. A typical
charge is 1 per cent a year.
The allocation rate complicates things. This shows how much of your money is
used to buy units and might vary during the life of the policy. A rate of
102 per cent sounds like a deft sleight of hand: can a company credit you
with more money than you invest? Not really.
This rate is a way of varying the initial charge implied in the usual 5 per
cent spread. For example, Pounds 100 is used to buy units. An allocation
rate of 102 per cent leaves about Pounds 97 invested. A 95 per cent rate
would leave about Pounds 90 invested.
Not surprisingly, a nil per cent allocation means nil invested. And that is
just what you get with some policies - nil allocation for the first year or
two. Your money is used to pay for setting-up expenses, such as commission.
Capital units are not as capital as they may sound: they cost you more. The
annual charge deducted from those units could be 4 per cent instead of 1.
You could get capital units in the first year or two of a regular premium
policy.
Before your money is used to buy any units at all, there are two other
deductions. First is what might be called policy fee, deducted each month.
Because it is a flat-rate fee, it bites harder on lower premiums. A Pounds 2
fee on a Pounds 50 premium is a not-insignificant 4 per cent.
Then there is a mortality charge, the cost of the investment's life
insurance element. This will vary depending on your age, sex, whether you
smoke, and on the life company running the plan.
With-profits policies
There are no explicit charges on these plans, which makes it impossible to
compare costs with unit-linked policies and other investments. The best you
can do is to find out the reduction in the annual yield. This is an
imprecise figure which can give only an approximate idea of how expenses and
costs may affect your returns.
A reduction of 3 per cent means that a projected annual return of 10 per
cent would fall to 7 per cent because of costs. The reduction in annual
yield excludes the cost of life cover - the mortality charge.
How costs reduce pay-outs
Two well-respected insurance companies provided figures on how costs reduce
returns. Both relate to Pounds 50 monthly premiums for a male aged 30 next
birthday.
Equitable Life quoted for a with-profits policy and an assumed rate of
growth of 8 per cent. A 10-year policy would be worth Pounds 9,048 if all
the premiums were invested, but that drops by about 8 per cent after
expenses to Pounds 8,355. The difference on a 25-year policy is about 11 per
cent: Pounds 40,837 instead of Pounds 45,833.
A Standard Life unit-linked policy with an assumed rate of growth of 7.5 per
cent would be worth Pounds 8,829 without charges, but that falls by 14 per
cent to Pounds 7,544. Over 25 years, a return of Pounds 42,425 falls by 21
per cent to Pounds 33,320.
New rules on
disclosure of costs
From January, life insurance companies and financial advisers will have to
provide much more information. This will show the effect of any costs on
cash pay-outs, both at maturity and if you cash in the policy early.
The result of this new regime could be to force down costs (including
commission) as companies seek ways to become more competitive. It could also
mean that many investors are deterred from buying life insurance-based
investments altogether as they discover more flexible, cost-effective ways
to make their money work for them.
Tax
This is not normally considered an investment cost but it is a factor for
some investors. There is no tax on so-called qualifying policies (but that
is more of interest to higher-rate taxpayers and those who pay capital gains
tax).
Basic-rate tax and some capital gains tax is met by the life company before
an investor is paid out, and cannot be reclaimed.

FT  11 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family: Kleinwort issue goes sour - A look
at the 85,000 investors who face a dilemma
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If you were one of the 85,000 people who subscribed for shares in the
Kleinwort European Privatisation investment trust (Kepit) earlier this year,
you should soon be receiving a demand for the second 50p instalment. The
shares were offered in February on a part-paid basis with half the 100p
share price due then and half on August 1.
Some people seem to have thought this was a good opportunity to subscribe
for shares cheaply, sell them for a profit in the first few weeks of
trading, and never have to stump up the rest of the share price.
Unfortunately, it did not quite work out that way. Unless you were very
quick off the mark, you would never have made a profit.
The performance of Kepit shares has been disappointing. They stand at 30.5p,
an apparent fall of almost 40 per cent since the launch. If you add in the
value of the warrants included as a sweetener, the fall is still steep: a
package of five shares and one warrant, for which investors have so far paid
250p, is now worth 181p - down 27.6 per cent.
Even if you assume that the extra 50p payment will add a full 50p to the
share price, that is still a fall of 13.8 per cent. (The FT-SE 100 has
fallen 11.4 per cent over the same period). The net asset value per 50p
share has fallen to 41p.
Kepit's rival, the Mercury European Privatisation trust, which was
fully-paid from the start, has done marginally better. Five shares and a
warrant cost investors 500p and are now worth 448p, down 10.4 per cent. The
latest net asset value per 100p share is 95.4p, roughly back to where it was
on the first day of trading.
Disgruntled shareholders, who may feel reluctant to part with more for Kepit
shares, have little room for manoeuvre. Their choice is simple: sell before
mid-July (when the shares start trading as fully-paid) and take a loss, or
keep the shares and pay the second instalment in the hope that, by holding
on long enough, the trust will come good. Refusal to pay will lead only to
forfeiting the shares.
Pep investors face an added complication. The first instalment paid in
February counts towards the 1993/4 Pep allowance, but, unless you paid
sufficient cash into your Pep before the tax year-end to cover the second
instalment, the second half will use your 1994/5 Pep allowance, even if you
did not use all of last year's.
Alternatively, to cover the cost of the second instalment on the remaining
shares, you could sell some of the part-paid shares and/or warrants held in
the 1993/4 Pep without eating into this year's Pep allowance. But anyone who
applied for the maximum of 6,000 Pepable shares probably was allocated
1,890. You would have to sell about 1,040, and all 378 warrants attached to
them, to make enough to cover the payment due on the remaining 850 shares.
Losses within Peps cannot be offset against gains elsewhere for tax
purposes.
Industry observers were speculating until recently that Kleinwort might do
better to cancel the cash call and carry on with a more manageable trust of
half the size. But this option was ruled out. The most obvious explanation,
apart from loss of face, is that intermediaries received 3 per cent
commission on the full share price back in February. If the second
instalment were not paid they would, effectively, have received an
unacceptably high 6 per cent commission.

FT  11 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family: Winners and losers in a falling
market - A look at why some shares have been hit hard
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The cold downdraft felt by the stock market since the beginning of February
has turned attention from recovery plays to the more defensive types of
stock which traditionally do well in more difficult times.
Mark Brown, equity strategist at Hoare Govett, says that when the market
started to fall at the beginning of February, there was a classic rotation
of sectors. Those which performed best in the previous 18-month recovery
phase - such as banks and building stocks - were the first to fall in the
shake-out.
At NatWest Securities, Bob Semple says that examining the reasons for the
market's fall - mainly, a fear that inflation was rising again and interest
rates would be increased to control prices - explains the winners and losers
among sectors and stocks.
Bond markets were hit particularly by interest rate worries, so
high-yielding equities such as utilities did badly. That, plus renewed
concerns about regulation for many utilities, explains the poor showing in
the league tables by companies like British Gas and British Telecom, as well
as the water and electricity groups.
Similarly, fears of rising interest rates have hit the building materials
and construction areas, both cyclical sectors which did well when the market
was rising. That explains the presence of stocks like Caradon, Anglian Group
(which warned on profits in March) and George Wimpey.
Conversely, sectors which are seen as benefiting from inflation - whether or
not they do, in fact - have fallen less sharply. That includes
consumer-related sectors such as food retailers and brewers and stocks such
as J. Sainsbury, Tesco and Wm Morrison, and some stores groups.
Warburg Securities suggests that food retailers, which have been
experiencing margin pressure from the various price-cutting campaigns, could
widen their margins again if inflation returns.
Oil has been the best-performing sector since the market peak, but that has
had more to do with a rising oil price, and the bid for Lasmo, than with the
market. Similarly, other commodity prices have been rising, helping the
extractive industries sector and RTZ, in particular.
Banks and financials have been poor performers. Merchant banks were caught
up in the market whirlpool: they make money from a high stock market through
trading securities and acting in bids, rights issues and flotations. Thus,
when the market falls, their shares fall. High in the poor performers' list
are SG Warburg, Hambros and Kleinwort Benson, despite profit growth.
Worst performers in the banking sector among FT-SE 100 stocks have been
Standard Chartered and HSBC. Both were affected by the slide in the Hong
Kong stock market, and the former by concerns that Lloyds Bank would sell
its stake in Standard Chartered after its bid for the Cheltenham &amp;
Gloucester building society. Life insurance groups are still under a cloud
from the row over sales of personal pensions and possible compensation.
Bids (or rumours of them) have been behind some of the strong individual
stock performances. Lasmo and Hogg both received bids, while Portals nearly
did. Meanwhile, companies with well-known problems such as London
International Group and Eurotunnel have seen their shares near the top of
the poor performers' list.
Small companies have, in aggregate, outperformed large ones on the way down,
with the 'small cap' index falling less steeply than the FT-SE 100. This
often happens as fund managers, looking to reduce their exposure to equities
and raise cash, pick the most tradeable stocks where they can deal more
easily.

FT  11 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family: Unigate set to deliver - The week
ahead
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Christian Salvesen reports full-year results on Monday but these are likely
to show only a modest increase on the previous year's pre-tax Pounds 75.9m.
Following a profits warning by the group in January, the shares have
underperformed the market by about 40 per cent, but next week's figures
should prove to be a turning point.
When Unigate reports annual profits on Tuesday, the growth rate is expected
to exceed the modest increase announced last Wednesday by arch-rival
Northern Foods. Forecasts for Unigate suggest a rise of about Pounds 10m
from the Pounds 97.9m, excluding exceptionals, recorded in 1993.
But the gain is more a reflection of Unigate's greater recovery from a lower
base and the restructuring of activities it has been pursuing since the
arrival of Ross Buckland as chief executive in 1990.
Three water companies will be announcing finals next week, with most
analysts expecting a reinforcement of the trends seen so far: steady
progress in the core utility business and further news on cost-cutting.
Severn Trent (Tuesday) is pegged to report profits of between Pounds 280m
and Pounds 285m, and an 8.5 per cent increase in the pay-out to 22.9p.
Thames (Wednesday) is estimated to come in with a 2 per cent decline in
profits to Pounds 245m, and an increase in the dividend of just over 8 per
cent to 22.7p.
Southern Water (Thursday) is forecast to return profits more than 8 per cent
ahead to about Pounds 129m, with an 8.9 per cent dividend rise - at the
higher end of increases seen so far - to 23.2p.
London Electricity is expected to disclose pre-tax profits of about Pounds
185m, compared with Pounds 145.5m, on Wednesday. A rise of around 14 per
cent from last year's 19.5p is on the cards for the dividend.
The following day, South Wales Electricity is expected to announce Pounds
100m pre-tax, against Pounds 87m. The City expects a dividend of about
25.3p, against 22.3p.
The second quarter is traditionally the weakest for NFC, and comparisons
when it reports interim results on Wednesday will be onerous because last
time's figures were flattered by a Pounds 50m profit from the sale of the
group's waste management arm.
Reflecting this, profits on an FRS 3 basis are likely to fall from Pounds
86.6m to Pounds 53m.
They should, however, show healthy growth, from Pounds 37.5m to about Pounds
49m, on a normalised basis as the recovery in the US and UK economies begins
to pull more consumer goods through the distribution pipeline serviced by
NFC's logistics operations.
FKI, the electrical engineering group, is expected to turn in annual pre-tax
profits of at least Pounds 50m on Thursday, up from Pounds 38m in the
preceding year.
The main drive of the increase is expected to come from the materials
handling division, but good growth also is expected from the automotive
division, which has undergone a thorough rationalisation programme in North
America.
The main interest in Berisford International's interim results on Tuesday
will lie in the progress it is making with its acquisition of Magnet. It
paid a knockdown Pounds 56m for the kitchen and joinery company in January,
the first step in its planned transformation from shell company to
conglomerate. Its shares are up from 128p to 212p since the deal but
languish far below their late-1980s levels.

VideoLogic, an electronics company based in Kings Langley, north of London,
is being demerged from its parent Avesco, the quoted broadcast equipment
services group, and will be floated on the stock market through a placing
which will value the company at up to Pounds 83.9m, writes Alan Cane. Some
Pounds 21.5m before expenses is being raised.
The need to demerge the company complicates the issue. Existing Avesco
shareholders will receive one VideoLogic demerger share for each Avesco
share and will have a preferential opportunity to participate in the
placing.
Warburg, which is underwriting the placing, will invite selected brokers and
intermediaries to take up any shortfall.
The share price, being set through a book-building exercise, is expected to
fall between 55p and 70p and applications close at noon on June 30.
VideoLogic is a leader in the design of chips and boards which can be fitted
into personal computers to enable them to display full-motion video,
essential for many multi-media applications.
The demand for its products is expected to be explosive, given the growth of
the personal computer market and accelerating interest in multi-media.
The company is being demerged because its demands for research and
development cash are now beyond Avesco which, in any case, is anxious to
concentrate on its core business.

Danka Business Systems was virtually unknown to UK investors three years
ago. Despite its UK listing, its main business - supplying and servicing
business equipment - was in the US. With a market capitalisation of more
than Pounds 600m, most UK investors are well aware of the company now.
The key directors, chairman Mark Vaughan-Lee, chief executive Dan Doyle and
finance director David Snell, bought a total of 2.1m shares at a price
equivalent to 40p in February 1992. At the start of this year, the shares
peaked at 388p and now we are seeing some serious selling.
Vaughan-Lee disposed of 320,000 at 347p, reducing his holding to 700,000,
while Doyle sold 1.2m at 345p. He also exercised an option over 400,000 more
and sold them, also for 345p, although he retains just under 7m.
Capital &amp; Regional Properties, like many companies in its sector, has
enjoyed spectacular share price performance since the start of 1993. Joint
managing director Roger Boyland sold 221,491 shares at 174p leaving him with
500,000, the third-largest holding on the board.
James Dewhirst, vice-chairman of clothing company Dewhirst Group, has been
in the market adding to his holding. Between May 13 and May 23, he bought
75,000 shares at 118p. Now he has bought a further 105,000 at between 122p
and 123p. Of the three Dewhirst family members on the board, however, his
3.2m shares remain the lowest holding. Dewhirst is one of the larger
suppliers to Marks &amp; Spencer.

FT  11 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family: Calling investors to account - A
look at the ins and outs of the stock exchange's new rolling settlement
system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There are now only 25 working days until the new system of settling payment
for buying and selling shares comes into effect on July 18. Out will go
account periods and in will come phase one: 10-day rolling settlement.
The idea is to establish a quicker payments system by abolishing the
existing account period of two to three weeks. The aim is to move to phase
two - five-day rolling settlement - perhaps some time next year. Investors
who deal only occasionally may find themselves little affected, at least by
phase one, but others may find the transformation difficult.
How will rolling
settlement work?
Unlike the other main financial centres - New York, Tokyo and Frankfurt -
London operates on traded accounts. The stock exchange divides the year into
account periods, usually two weeks. The value of shares which the investor
has bought and sold within any account period is calculated at the end of it
and the investor must then settle up, usually within seven working days. The
day by which he must pay is called account or settlement day.
This system means that those who trade earliest in the account period have
more time to settle than others. Most importantly, investors are able to
settle the net amount. If, for example, you were to buy shares for Pounds
1,000 and sell others for Pounds 600 within an account period, you would pay
out only Pounds 400 (excluding costs) on settlement day.
Rolling settlement will do away with this. Under the new arrangement, known
as T+10, you would need to place Pounds 1,000 of cleared funds with your
broker 10 working days after the day you bought the shares - and you would
receive Pounds 600 10 days after the day you sold them. In effect, every day
will be account day from July 18, with cash delivered for every trade; hence
'rolling' settlement.
The mechanics of trading remain unchanged in that orders are still placed
through a broker who will send out a contract note confirming the
transaction, the settlement date and the amount due. According to the
Securities and Futures Authority (SFA), contract notes will become the
demand for payment. Investors will have to get used to responding quickly
once they receive the contract note. Those who will benefit the most are
sellers, since they will receive their money more quickly than at present.
The new system will, therefore, see the demise of 'account traders'. These
are investors who buy shares they think will go up in a hurry. If the shares
do, the investors sell them within the same account, so earning themselves a
cheque without having had to pay out anything other than sharedealing costs.
Delivery of shares will also be affected. Now, if you sell shares and buy
them back during an account period, you do not have to deliver them. Under
rolling settlement, you will. However, some inter-account trading will still
be possible. By engineering the co-incidence of separate deals on one day,
you would still be able to settle net on that day. So if you sold shares on
a Tuesday on the maximum of T+10, you could buy shares on Wednesday on T+9
and pay only the difference on settlement day - Tuesday week. If the deal is
closed off in this way and you were conducting it to 'bed-and-breakfast'
shares for capital gains tax purposes, the stock would not have to be
delivered.
What about nominees?
Many brokers are encouraging their clients to have stock registered in their
nominee account - the company formed by brokers or fund managers to hold
shares on behalf of their clients - rather than the client's own name.
Nominee accounts ease administration for brokers and reduce their costs. A
broker with 500 clients in a nominee account needs to handle only one
dividend payment instead of 500 dividend cheques.
Investors also face less paperwork because they do not keep share
certificates and do not have to sign transfer deeds to sell shares.
Brokers may charge for holding shares in their nominee company but Geoffrey
Turner, chief executive of the Association of Private Client Stockbrokers
and Investment Managers, says: 'If any client feels that he is being heavily
charged for a nominee service, he should shop around for the many brokers
who won't charge him.'
Investors do not have to go into nominees just yet. Under 10-day rolling
settlement, there will still be enough time to post certificates for a
purchase or sale. But once/if T+5 emerges, this is likely to be
impracticable.
If you are happy to be in a nominee account, it is preferable to choose a
broker who runs a designated, rather than a pooled, nominee. The latter
groups together shareholders and the only name that appears on the register
is that of the nominee company.
Investors lose benefits - such as the company's annual report, access to the
annual general meeting and direct news of a rights issue - unless they have
made special arrangements with the broker.
In a pooled nominee, the broker's name and the client's designation -
usually a number - appear together on the company register and this should
ensure that the investor retains shareholder benefits.
How safe are nominees?
Nominee services are not an authoriseable activity under the Financial
Services Act, which set up the existing system of regulation for financial
services. Technically, therefore, they fall outside the scope of the
investors' compensation scheme which pays out a maximum of Pounds 48,000 to
an investor, comprising 100 per cent of the first Pounds 30,000 lost and 90
per cent of the next Pounds 20,000.
For all practical purposes, however, it is unlikely that investors would
find they were ineligible for compensation were a nominee company to go
under because of the close connection between it and the stockbroker (which
should be authorised by the SFA).
Turner does not doubt that nominees are robust. 'Anyone who has a personal
equity plan is required by law to hold his assets in a nominee,' he points
out. 'Why do we hear no anxieties about this from Pep-holders? Because the
system works well.'
What about payment for shares? Under rolling settlement, the broker must
have cleared funds with which to take delivery of shares on T+10. If the
investor has not managed to get the money across, the broker is faced with
two choices: he can either extend his own credit to settle the agreed share
purchase or fail to complete the trade, leaving the investor without the
shares.
Since brokers would prefer to avoid being put into that situation, many are
encouraging clients to keep an account with them. They can then withdraw
funds for payment of shares and deposit money when shares are sold. Some
brokers offer little or no interest on these accounts, so check that the
rates offered are competitive.
A number of stockbrokers may extend cash to their clients if funds have not
been cleared in time. 'Margin trading' - examined in the Weekend FT by Norma
Cohen two weeks ago - which is common in the US, may take time to reach
private clients in the UK domestic market.

FT  11 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family: Two account periods left
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There are only two complete account periods left until rolling settlement
begins on July 18, writes Scheherazade Daneshkhu. The stock exchange divides
the year up into account periods, named by letters of the alphabet. We are
now in account period L, in which the last day for dealings is June 17.
All trades conducted any time in the account period, which began on June 6,
are totalled and a single bill for the net amount is sent out which has to
be settled on June 27. This allows some investors (ie, those who have dealt
early in the account) up to 15 working days to settle.
The system allowing them to settle the net amount is useful for all
investors. And speculators who aim to buy and sell at a profit within the
same account can, if successful, make money without ever having to put up a
penny.
Account periods will disappear from July 18, although investors who dealt in
the last period - account N - can still settle in the usual way on July 25.
From July 18, the settlement day will be 10 working days after dealing day -
or T+10.

FT  11 JUN 94 / Markets: Stocks plod on past the by-elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Voters went to bury John Major on Thursday not to praise him - yet the
markets blithely ignored the ceremony.
A bad by-election result for the Tories was already in stock prices, market
makers suggested. And anyway any number of things - good or bad  - could
still happen to the government before the general election, including faster
economic growth. There was plenty of time left to factor-in risk premiums to
equities, bonds and sterling.
Thus, with politics despatched, stocks continued their modest recovery. The
FT-SE 100 index climbed back above the 3,000 level from its rout a fortnight
ago and ended the week up a net 58.1 points at 3,055.9.
But trading volumes remained very light, as the accompanying chart shows.
Institutions continue to buy sparingly, confident that equity and gilt
bargains will be around for a while yet. Tuesday was one of the quietest
days in 12 months.
Yet investors might be less sanguine about politics come Monday morning,
after the Euro-elections results are released. If the sharp by-election
swing against the Government is mirrored in European constituencies, the
Tories could end up with no seats in Strasbourg. Then it becomes irrelevant
how many speeds the prime minister's Euro-vehicle has. He will have no
Euro-MPs left to push it.
Third place in the by-elections and 'a disastrous showing' in the European
elections would leave the Conservatives 'reeling from a fatal blow to their
credibility', says Trevor Laugharne, a Kleinwort Benson strategist, with
consequent damage to gilts and sterling.
He identifies two particular political risks that would dog the markets:
that this government would relax monetary and fiscal policy to curry
electoral favour - to the detriment of the inflation rate; and that the next
government would more likely be Labour and more interventionist, to the even
greater detriment of inflation.
The political pressure on markets might not be be so cut and dried, argues
Ifty Islam, a bond analyst with Merrill Lynch, in London. A newly assertive
Bank of England, and the publishing of the minutes of monthly meetings
between the Bank governor and the chancellor, have 'probably reduced the
extent to which politics can influence policy'.
Moreover, with the economy accelerating and three years until the general
election, the Tories for some tax cuts.
He also points out that the electorate thinks Labour could govern better
than the Tories, even on a number of traditional Conservative issues. Voters
expressed greater confidence in Labour on, for example, law and order,
defence, tax cutting and beating inflation, in recent Gallup opinion polls.
However he adds: 'It is pretty hard to see much of a gap between the main
parties on most aspects of economic policy.'
Timing may be the crucial question. With governments only facing the
electorate every four or five years, markets only focus intensely on
politics in bursts before elections. 'Politics are either very, very
important or not very important at all,' says Mark Brown, head of strategy
at Hoare Govett.
A terrific Tory government today might only be worth another 100 points on
the Footsie but, 12 months from now as the next election looms, it could be
worth 300 points, he hazards.
Most analysts consider there is a more imminent risk to the confidence of
foreign investors in UK markets which could exacerbate any selling pressure
in coming days. Less attuned to the reality of British politics, foreigners
could still jump to the conclusion that Labour were socialists intent on
shackling the economy and that the Tories were destined, as ever, on
liberating it.
Yet even domestic investors can find themselves confused. It did not sound
like Tory-talk when Stephen Dorrell, Financial Secretary to the Treasury,
suggested recently that companies might be paying out too much of their
profits in dividends, leaving insufficient money for investment.
The prime minister was quick to point out this week that the government had
no intention of controlling dividends. But he ducked the issue. The
government could still try to raise revenues by reducing institutions'
dividend tax privileges. Suspicious about the government's intentions, City
lobbyists and analysts remain on high alert.
Certainly, companies know how to please the institutions. Hefty dividend
rises this week came from BAA (up 12.5 per cent), Amersham International (up
15 per cent), Vodafone (up 20 per cent) and EMAP (up 12.2 per cent).
Institutional support was also evident for a number of companies. LIG, the
condom maker, launched a one for one rescue rights issue and the new issue
market remains open to those companies willing to accept realistic pricings.
Not all of them can. British Printing Company, for example, pulled its float
on Monday. Its debt load was too great to allow a lower rating.
One notable newcomer to London this week was Service Corporation
International, the world's largest funeral director. Wanting one foot in the
UK market, it launched an Pounds 87.4m hostile bid for Great Southern Group,
the second largest quoted UK funeral director.
Service, which has grown from one funeral home in Texas 32 years ago to 843
worldwide today, under the chairmanship of Robert Waltrip, likes to please.
'As long as its legal and in good taste, we will try to do what the family
wants,' a spokesman said.
Great Southern's controlling family only wants Service to go away. A trust
holding a 56.1 per cent stake has rejected the bid. Perhaps Barry Field, its
chairman, will need another job soon: he is Tory MP for the Isle of Wight.

FT  11 JUN 94 / Markets: Not so much a rally, more an upward drift - Wall
Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As summer rallies go, this one hardly looks electrifying. Talk of a seasonal
take-off for share prices has been commonplace almost since the last snows
melted (such talk reflects in part an effort by brokers to drum up business
 -the volume of trading on Wall Street has sagged in recent months.) But
with humidity beginning to fall like a damp towel across the eastern
seaboard, there is no sign yet of a buying spree.
It has looked more like an upward drift than a rally. Before yesterday
morning, when share prices jumped on technical factors, the Dow Jones
industrial average had gained around 50 points: in the past two or three
weeks, it had edged up only 10.
For brokers seeking buy orders this is not particularly good news. But
investors have little to complain about. 'You can have a perfectly
respectable market without a lot of enthusiasm,' says Dick Hoey, an
economist and fund manager at Dreyfus, the mutual funds group. In fact, a
slow and steady progression, without the fervour of the buying spree which
pushed the Dow to a peak at the end of January, is just the thing to send
investors to the beach happy.
Short of some extraneous event - an international crisis over North Korea's
nuclear intentions, for instance - there seems little to disturb the
market's genial summer drift. The economic data remains satisfyingly mixed:
not too positive - which would set off another sharp decline in the
government bond market - and not too negative - which would hit expectations
of future corporate earnings growth.
Producer price figures for June, released yesterday, continued this
ambiguous trend. The index fell 0.1 per cent, compared with an expected rise
of 0.2 per cent - good news for inflation-watchers. But the core producer
price index, excluding energy and food, rose faster than expected.
There were other indications, last week, that the disinflationary forces
which have prevailed in the US economy so far in the 1990s remain strong. On
Thursday, PepsiCo provided a gloomy outlook for sales of its soft drinks in
the US, and for its restaurant business. The memory of Marlboro Friday still
haunts the stock market: if consumers are turning away from big-brand
cigarettes to cheaper alternatives, why not colas or hamburgers as well?
Pepsi's announcement battered other soft drink and restaurant stocks. It may
not be good news for some consumer goods stocks, but the message it sends
about consumer habits is positive for the stock market as a whole.
Profits warnings like those at Pepsi, are few and far between. Companies
remain in the midst of a strong profits advance, which should flow though in
the form of higher dividends for the remainder of this year.
Abby Cohen, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, expects dividends to grow on
average by 7 per cent this year, compared with just 1 per cent in each of
the last three. Companies have used the extra cash generated as they came
out of recession to pay off debt or invest in renewed growth. Now, says
Cohen, they are ready to give more to shareholders.
That, in turn, will underpin one of the market's most important valuation
criteria, the dividend yield. Even after the fall in share prices this
spring, the dividend yield on the broad-based S&amp;P 500 remains under 3 per
cent (a level last reached in the overheated summer of 1987.) Higher
dividends will help.
Low inflation, though, may remain a more important factor. The rise in bond
yields since last October, reflecting nervousness about inflation, has
already opened a bigger gap between fixed income and equity yields. The
yield on the 30-year benchmark government bond has risen 1.5 percentage
points, to 7.3 per cent, while the dividend yield has hardly budged. The
higher bond yields rise, the more that relationship becomes strained.
Not that all the dividend news has been good. Alexander &amp; Alexander, a big
insurance broker, cut its dividends by 90 per cent last week, to just 2.5
cents a share. What was most notable about this announcement, though, was
its rarity: it looked like a hangover from early 1993 or 1992, rather than a
hint of more widespread earnings pressures.
Another encouraging sign for stock prices has been the continued flow of
cash into mutual funds which invest in equities. The funds attracted Dollars
11.7bn in April, up from Dollars 7.9bn in March and well ahead of gloomy
projections. The April level is close to the average monthly inflow into
mutual funds over the past year or so - a period during which such funds,
which now own around 10 per cent of US shares, have become among the most
important marginal buyers of equities.

FT  11 JUN 94 / Markets: Why property shares are the party poopers - Bottom
Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After the party, the hangover. Property shares, which produced a glittering
return of 89 per cent last year, are now languishing in the doldrums. In the
last six months, the sector has fallen by an average of 14 per cent,
compared with a 4.5 per cent fall in the market as a whole.
At first sight, the reasons for this lacklustre performance are not obvious.
The reporting season for big quoted companies, which ended this week,
reveals some spectacular results.
Land Securities, the sector's largest company, produced a 34 per cent rise
in net asset value over the year to end-March, as it reaped the benefit of
the remarkable recovery in the property market over the past year. British
Land did even better. On Thursday, it announced a 46 per cent rise in its
net asset value for the year to end-March.
Moreover, most analysts are predicting healthy - albeit more modest - rises
in values this year. For instance, British Land's net asset value is tipped
to rise from Pounds 4.23 to as much as Pounds 5 this year.
Indeed, the weakness of property shares is less due to a serious setback in
the sector than from the excessive expectations that had been built into
prices. At the start of the year, hopes of rapidly rising property values
were reflected in the average 20 per cent premium to net asset values on
which shares traded, according to UBS, brokers. Since then, they have sunk
to an 8 per cent discount to assets.
The waning of investors' enthusiasm for property shares is partly because
investors became jaded by a glut of new property companies coming to the
market. A more important reason, however, is that the direct property
investment market has gone off the boil, as a result of the ailing state of
the bond market. Total returns from property actually fell in May, according
to Richard Ellis, chartered surveyors.
Many commentators think that property share prices will not start to rise
again until there is convincing evidence of rental growth in the property
market. If bond values suffer another battering, there is a chance that
property prices - and the share prices of the quoted companies - will suffer
further falls.
But even if the big picture for property shares is uninspiring, investors
could still do well by careful selection of property shares. In the last six
months, some of the best-performing smaller companies have bucked the trend:
Shares in Burford Holdings, which yesterday bought London's Trocadero
Centre, have risen by 27 per cent in the last six months, while Helical Bar,
a developer, has increased by 31 per cent.
'Some of the smaller companies are providing more excitement and interest
than the bigger companies,' says Robert Kynoch, of NatWest Securities,
brokers. He cites Capital and Regional and Helical Bar as examples of
companies with entrepreneurial flair and an ability to ride the cycle.
'If you are a clever entrepreneur, there are very few markets where you
can't find value,' says Marc Gilbard, of Goldman Sachs. Of the sector's
smaller companies, he favours Helical Bar, Burford, Allied London, Asda
Property Holdings, Capital &amp; Regional and Chelsfield. Of the larger
companies, he opts for those with good quality portfolios, namely Land
Securities, British land and Brixton Estate.
In the view of many City analysts, values are likely to drift through this
summer. But once property rents start rising, the sector could get a new
lease of life. David Tunstall, of Smith New Court, broker, argues that there
is plenty of scope for share prices to grow, since the sector is at a
relatively early stage of a cyclical upswing. 'We are in a cycle that will
last three to four years,' he says.

FT  11 JUN 94 / Markets: Building society lottery tickets - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN O'CONNOR, personal finance editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Personal investors are paranoid. But maybe that is because everybody is
trying to get them. Look at the evidence.
Last week Financial Secretary Stephen Dorrell appeared to be threatening
dividends. This week the High Court scotched Lloyds' plans to hand money out
to thousands of happy Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester savers and borrowers. And now
the Inland Revenue has been caught sending incorrect assessments to half a
million taxpayers.
The people who are baying hardest for blood are the 1.4m C &amp; G members who
have seen large cash sweeteners torn from their grasp.
True, the scheme has been scotched not killed. And Lloyds and C &amp; G have
always made it clear that if their original proposal was challenged they
would fight. But the fresh uncertainty is deeply worrying for members,
particularly the newer savers and borrowers, who fear that they may get
squeezed out.
The best advice for C &amp; G savers is as clear as it is unpalatable. Sit
tight. Closing down an existing account endangers any rights you may have to
any future payouts. It is possible but by no means certain that newer savers
may be excluded from any payout. But if there is a chance of sharing in a
handout, it would seem foolish to abandon an opportunity which cost you
nothing.
If the court ruling holds, and a merger is pushed through, it sounds as if
no borrowers will benefit. For existing borrowers that is just tough: you
presumably took out a C &amp; G mortgage because it was the best available.
And C &amp; G is doing its best to find some other way of rewarding you.
Remortgaging purely because you may not get a handout would be as expensive
as it is pettish.
The far smaller number of people who were considering taking out a C &amp; G
mortgage, purely in order to benefit from the proposed Pounds 500 handout to
all borrowers, new and old, are in a trickier position.
It was always hard to believe that new borrowers could sign up for the
sweeteners. Buying a winning lottery ticket before the draw is one thing.
Buying a winning ticket for the same price after the draw seems too good to
be true.
If you are looking for a new mortgage and you believe in fairies, it is
worth chancing your luck by going to C &amp; G. Otherwise get whichever mortgage
looks best on the normal yardsticks and, if the answer to your search
happens to be C &amp; G, drink a toast to Tinkerbell.
All those people who were scouring the streets in order to deposit money
with the next C &amp; G can also take a breather.
The High Court ruling is effectively saying that longer term 'shareholders'
are entitled to share in any bonanzas; short term 'speculators' are not. And
the dividing line between the sheep and goats is put at two years.
This rulebook may be torn up. But if you are happy with your building
society account on fundamental grounds (ie you are getting a good rate of
interest without unacceptable strings), sticking with your existing society
will also consolidate any sitting tenant rights you already have.
Once the dust clears, other short-term strategies may become sensible. It
now rests with C &amp; G to challenge the High Court or come up with a workable
proposal.
But longer term what is needed is a far clearer framework for building
society members to act within. Creeping demutualisation means that people
are sometimes suddenly bounced into quasi-shareholder status, with
unexpected claims on the society's assets.
But most building society members have no idea whether their society has any
spare assets or whether merger plans which will unlock them are pending. No
wonder, then, that many of them are starting to treat building society
membership as a lottery ticket. The fault is not in them but in the
fuzziness of the system (Page VII).
*****
Stockbrokers often recommend a nice portfolio of blue chips as if they were
Ovaltine. Our snapshot of winners and losers during the recent stockmarket
shakeout (page V) provides a salutary reminder that not all blue chips are
equal.
Between the market's February peak and its recent trough, the FT-SE 100
index fell by almost 17 per cent. But the best individual FT-SE 100 shares
managed to hold their own, while the worst lost over 30 per cent. And that
is over a period of just four months.
Similar comparisons over longer periods show a far wider range of rises and
falls.
There are two seemingly contradictory messages for investors there. First,
if even blue chips can be that skittish, investing in individual shares
should be avoided.
Secondly, if investing in individual shares, even blue chips, can be that
profitable, it is well worth the effort. Both messages are right. If you
have both the knowledge and the time to select individual shares, it can be
more lucrative than investing through unit and investment trusts. But that
is a rather demanding 'if'.
*****
The sad thing about the latest exposure of the Revenue's failings is that
few people will be surprised. Many individual tax inspectors try their best
to be helpful as well as accurate. But some remain both uninformed and
unhelpful. No wonder, most people still see them as 'the enemy'.

FT  11 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family: Inland Revenue assessment error - At
a Glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Taxpayers would be well advised to study their assessments closely this year
following a highly critical report released yesterday from the National
Audit Office on the work of the Inland Revenue.
Of the roughly 5m Schedule D (self-employed) and Schedule E
(pay-as-you-earn) taxpayers who currently receive assessments, 3.2m had to
receive at least one revised assessment - in most cases because they had
been asked to pay too much tax.
In the majority of cases, the reasons for the problems were the fault of the
taxpayer: providing wrong information or failing to supply it on time. But
for 500,000 taxpayers, it was the Inland Revenue that was at fault. And
taxpayers or their professional advisers were at least as likely as the
Revenue to notice the error and request adjustments.
In 62 per cent of these cases, the cause was incorrect allowances and
reliefs made by inspectors, and in 22 per cent a failure to use information
already provided. A further 11 per cent was put down to miscalculation of
income and 3 per cent to incorrect deductions.
The Revenue has pledged to tighten checks and improve levels of accuracy, as
well as to publish new quality targets.

At a Glance

Lloyds Bank's share price suffered briefly on news of the high court ruling
which blocked the proposed merger with the Cheltenham and Gloucester
building society (see page VII). The judge ruled that the structure of the
deal, which involved cash bonuses for C &amp; G customers, was illegal. However,
after being marked down sharply on the news, the shares soon recovered, as
the setback was seen as temporary. Lloyds is expected to return with a
restructured bid shortly.

FT  11 JUN 94 / When he dies my dear, all this will be yours: How the life
assurance industry, with such a strong position in society, became accused
of a breach of trust
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH

<TEXT>
Ghayur Butt was told how to stand at a pub bar and knock a pint of beer over
a fellow customer. Profuse apologies were then supposed to be offered and
the victim would be bought another drink.
It is an old salesman's trick: you then chat about the victim's life, hopes,
ambitions and fears. You gain their confidence and then, as a friend, you
let them in on the deal. It was a trick taught to - but not used by - Ghayur
Butt.
But he was not selling amazing cures for baldness, an elixir of youth or
quarter price stereo sets. He was working in a respected financial services
industry, controlling Pounds 400bn of funds.
Butt was one of 200,000 'financial advisers' helping clients to choose
appropriate life assurance and pensions for their security that of their
families. At least, that is what they said they were doing and what an array
of providers such as Cornhill, Legal and General, Scottish Widows, Colonial
Mutual and Guardian Royal Exchange, claim is their mission.
Even life offices with respectable names such as these have been embroiled
in the industry's recent troubles. All five were fined by the industry's
regulator (Lautro) for breaking the rules (though not for practices as
extreme as those described by Butt).
Norwich Union, another household name, was recently forced to suspend its
entire sales force of 800 so that they could be retrained to give proper
financial advice.
Ghayur Butt has left his job with the once high-profile MI (formerly
Merchant Investors) insurance group, for which he worked at around the time
of the industry's frenetic expansion at the end of the 1980s. It was then,
he says, that he was taught the pub sales trick by a colleague. He says
there were other similiar tricks in the industry, for example: 'Some
salesmen sent letters to married women, talking about their company and
appending a blank form with a piece of paper telling the woman: 'This is
what you will get when your husband dies.'
In order to get the job with MI he had to convince his future boss that he
had a voracious appetite for money: 'I told him my ambition was to own six
or seven houses and an aircraft,' Butt says.
He is one of 100,000 salesmen who have left the industry since 1990, around
the peak of the business's prosperity. Hundreds of those who dropped out
have started legal action against their former companies alleging unfair
dismissal and poor business practice.
The charge against the industry is that in far too many cases it has been
filling the pockets of salesmen, senior managers - and in the case of
limited companies, of shareholders - by extracting fat commissions from the
high pressure selling of schemes which customers did not really want or
need. In tens of thousands of cases, policies are thought to have been
against the best interests of customers.
The industry is in a fearful mess, which would have astonished and saddened
the founding fathers of life assurance, who established the first mutual
assurance fund in 1762. This was based on a mathematical theory, which
ensured that the premiums of members would pay the benefits promised by
their policies.
The first prospectus, called A short Account of the Society for Equitable
Assurances on Lives and Survivorships, published in 1764, says: 'These
considerations induced a number of gentlemen . . . to form a design of
establishing a Society for equitable assurances upon lives, with a view to
the sole benefit of the Persons Assured, whose interest hath been all along
considered as wholly distinct from, not to say incompatible with, that of
the Assurers; a society in which the assured being at the same time mutually
assurers one to the other, the interests of the one might be the interest of
both . . . ' *
More than two centuries later, the mutual societies operate in a world in
which these principles of self help and mutual support are mixed in with
modern ideas of marketing and salesmanship. They compete with profit
maximising companies, and have absorbed some of their ethos.
Although many independent advisers ensure that clients get good value for
money from respectable organisations, there are many others who are forced
to sell poor quality products, because they are tied agents trapped in a
commission structure which requires them to sell or starve. And many
policy-holders are left unaware of how much is being deducted from their
premiums.
As Jean Lucas, who sold insurance for the Pegasus investment company in
Plymouth, Devon says: 'You would see that some prospective clients might
have to struggle to pay the premiums, but because your livelihood depended
on it, you would play on their emotions to try to sell them something.'
Later this summer, the Securities and Investments Board, the main government
regulator for financial services, is to publish a report on pension
transfers which may require life companies to pay hundreds of millions of
pounds to consumers found to have lost out because they were sold
inappropriate products.
How could an industry with such a proud history and such a strong position
in British society become accused of such a breach of trust? Nearly 70 per
cent of UK families have some form of life insurance, with the industry
paying out about Pounds 10bn a year in benefits.
One answer is that not nearly as many people would have bought life
assurance if the policies had not been actively sold to them. This is
because the benefits are often paid far in the future and are difficult to
evaluate.
Moreover few consumers have the expertise to compare the benefits and costs
of different policies. 'What the consumer buys is all about who gets to him
first and how persuasive he is,' says Kit Jebens, chief executive of Lautro.
So from the mid-1980s, as the business responded to the surge in interest by
cash-rich consumers in investment products, life companies took on tens of
thousands of new sales agents.
New business was also offered by the government's decision in 1988 to allow
people to switch from occupational pension schemes to individually tailored
pensions offered by the private sector.
These were exciting times. Successful sales people - mainly self-employed -
could earn commissions of Pounds 500,000 a year and the very top ones up to
Pounds 1m.
Few were more successful than Trevor Deaves, the flamboyant founder of
Porchester investment group which reversed into Merchant Investors in 1987
and built up a reputation for highly aggressive selling. Deaves was known
for his stable of Porsches and his love of the big occasion - he once
financed an over-the-top production of Aida in the Earls Court exhibition
hall in London.
Deaves used to invite his 2,000 sales people to the London Palladium to
harangue them, sometimes with colourful language. They called him 'god'.
After leaving his job as chief executive of MI in 1991 following management
disputes, he is now chief operating officer of LifeCo, a US investment group
in Florida.
'Looking back at my time in MI I don't have any regrets,' he says. 'My
supporters think I had a dramatic and productive effect (on the life
industry), while the old fogeys are glad to see the back of me. I know which
side I'm on.'
Deaves adds: 'We had few unhappy customers. We were ahead of our time.'
But Alan Roberts, a former MI director who worked with Deaves, says that the
sales force was 'brainwashed' into maximising sales. 'Trevor could be very
hard on them (the sales force),' he recalls. 'You sometimes had to kick
people to get them off their backsides.'
Although MI would probably carry off the prizes for hard-sell techniques,
Allied Dunbar was also well known for its vigorous approach. Patrick
Bearchell, who worked for the company between 1991 and 1992, remembers
'strong pressure' from managers.
He says: 'We were licensed to give best advice but it wasn't' A superior
product offered by another company would not be mentioned, he says. This is
standard practice: under Lautro rules, direct salesmen need not discuss
competing products.
Stephen Day, who worked for the UK arm of Australian Mutual Provident, says:
'It's a very calculating industry, appealing to people's basic instincts. My
personality was completely changed during the six months I worked in the
business.'
Day was alluding to the system of rewards and punishments which continue to
characterise the industry's sales efforts.
The system was particularly powerful in the 1989-1991 period when the
atmosphere in some sales teams could be best described as Wild West mixed in
with eastern bazaar. Although product sales were still strong, the market
was beginning to become saturated and the first signs of the early 1990s
recession were starting to make selling conditions tougher.
Sales people were put under increasing pressure and encouraged by a range of
incentives, some of them fairly obvious, such as bottles of whisky and
holidays in the Bahamas. But in one life office, the manager would loan his
Rolex watch for a day to the agent who had made the best sale during the
week.
Bizarre punishments were also devised for those who had done badly: at one
branch of a big insurer, the man who was bottom of the sales league over the
previous month would be told to walk round the building for a day dressed in
ladies' underwear. A variation of this would be to make the person at the
bottom of the pile wear an over-sized nappy all day.
This culture was made the more frenetic by a rapid ebb and flow of sales
people. One authoritative estimate puts the annual turnover of sales
representatives in the early 1990s at nearly 60 per cent, compared with 30
to 40 per cent in more normal times.
They included all sorts of people: former airline pilots, computer
programmers, students, wine merchants, lawyers and amusement arcade
operators.
'In many cases people were told to draw up a hit list of family and friends:
after they had sold to them they would often leave to be replaced by
others,' says Ray McKay, a former Merchant Investors' salesman.
Derek Rogers, a director of the UK arm of the US insurer, Lincoln
International and a 30-year veteran of the industry, recalls: 'If you took
on 1,000 people you'd be lucky if 100 were any good. It was the mud on the
wall principle: you'd throw a lot on but a lot would drop off.'
However, he says the industry has changed, with much more attention being
paid to hiring the right people, retaining them for reasonable periods and
making sure that they give appropriate advice.
But can the industry really reform itself in this way? Jebens of Lautro says
a series of 'draconian' measures by the regulator - including tougher rules
on training, supervision of agents and the degree to which representatives
with poor sales records can transfer between companies - has led to much
more ethical sales behaviour.
'I am confident the level of abuses (to the consumer) is now at a more
acceptable level,' says Jebens.
Others from the industry say the criticism has got out of hand.
'The Law Society gets numerous complaints about lawyers but this doesn't get
the same publicity,' complains Mike Wilson, a former Allied Dunbar chief
executive who is now chief executive of the J. Rothschild Assurance company
set up two years ago.
Rogers, the Lincoln director, believes the industry is the subject of a
media vendetta. He says sardonically: 'Perhaps we will soon do away with
insurance companies and leave financial journalists to write about the
products people should have. But then 95 per cent of the population wouldn't
have proper insurance cover.'
But Jon Minchin, head of Pensionline, a company in Cheam, Surrey, which
advises on pension transfers, says: 'For the insurance industry, the rules
haven't changed anything. The commission structure remains, so does the
pressure to sell and the abuses will continue.'
One veteran of the industry, who asked not to be named, says: 'Having
trained a lot of rottweilers they (company managements) are expecting us to
behave like poodles, hoping we won't bite.'

FT  11 JUN 94 / The Long View: Missing the bullseye
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Now you see them, now you don't. This week, British Printing joined the list
of the amazing disappearing new issues. It followed Life Style Care, a
nursing home group, and General Cable and TeleWest, two cable TV operators,
snatched at the last minute off the public offering list. But the season's
biggest flotation, that of the venerable venture capital giant 3i, is still
on schedule for later this month.
Hundreds of companies are reputed to be planning flotations on the London
market but time might be running out. Usually, around 100 companies are
floated each year although, in 1992, the figure dipped to 82 in the economic
recession. Last year, however, new listings soared to 182. As for 1994, the
annualised rate in the first five months of the year has been 280.
The flow of companies to the market is always cyclical, but this time it is
exceptionally so. This is probably because of the large number of management
buy-outs which have been financed riskily through borrowings and venture
capital during the past few years. Such companies have only once chance of
hitting the bullseye and paying back the maximum amount of those liabilities
when they float.
The financial market cycle swings amazingly from one extreme to another:
from cheap money and expensive shares to the reverse. When, at the beginning
of February, base rates dipped to 5 1/4 per cent and the Footsie index was
around 3,500, the timing for issues was perfect. Today's
Johnny-come-latelies may have missed the boat, but some still think it is
worthwhile trying to get through the tunnel.
In America, the new issue cycle has been somewhat ahead of the UK's. Equity
underwritings rocketed from a trough of Dollars 24bn in 1990 to a peak of
Dollars 131bn in 1993, but have been falling back this year.
The key to it all is the turning point for short-term interest rates. This
has been reached in the US although not yet in the UK. But longer-term rates
have jumped already in Britain, leading to the present hiatus in the housing
market where buyers had become hooked on the very low medium-term fixed
rates on offer during the winter but which now have been jacked up from,
say, 6 1/2 to 8 1/2 per cent.
Short-term sterling interest rates have not risen since October 1989 (apart
from the transitory flurry on Black Wednesday) and bank base rates have
actually fallen 15 times in a row. But once these short-term floating rates
begin to climb, the behaviour of savers will change significantly.
Remember that in 1989, when base rates finished at 15 per cent, the personal
sector increased its holdings of bank and building society holdings by
Pounds 39bn while being a net seller of company securities worth Pounds
20.1bn (and gilts worth Pounds 3.3bn). Last year, the corresponding rise in
savings deposits was only Pounds 10.3bn (less than the interest credited)
and the personal sector was a net buyer of company securities and gilts to
the tune of Pounds 1.3bn and Pounds 5.4bn respectively.
The clever new-issue sponsor is the one who catches the precise moment at
which investors feel under maximum pressure to switch into long-term
investments. Perhaps I could single out Kleinwort Benson with its
brilliantly-timed European Privatisation investment trust launched in
January. It collected commitments of Pounds 500m from 85,000 investors - and
that was after sending Pounds 380m back.
Unfortunately, a good time for selling is not likely to be a good time for
buying. The 50p paid shares have tumbled to an effective 36.2p and investors
will soon have to dig into their pockets for the other 50p instalment due in
August. (See page VI).
The new-issue glut has not by itself caused the recent stock market setback
but there is an accumulating burden upon the capacity of both private and
institutional investors, especially for shares in small companies.
In 1990, share issues raised only Pounds 4.4bn; and after a leap to Pounds
11.1bn in 1991, when many big companies patched up the damage of the
recession through rights issues, the total fell back to Pounds 6.4bn in
1992. Last year, however, the figure soared to Pounds 16.3bn and has been
running at an even higher annual rate in 1994.
This supply problem has been aggravated by the low level of company
take-overs. It is all part of the same logic: companies have seen shares as
being expensive and so have preferred to sell them rather than buy. Whereas
in 1989 Pounds 17bn was paid in cash to the shareholders of acquired
companies, providing them with plenty of extra resources for investment
elsewhere, that figure was less than Pounds 2bn in 1993.
Much of the money raised by recent new issues has been used to pay off bank
loans. Last year, for instance, industrial and commercial companies reduced
their bank indebtedness by Pounds 12bn (serving perhaps to explain the
eagerness of the banks to buy their way deeper into the house mortgage
business). Perhaps the banks should watch and wait patiently. After all,
corporate loan demand is reviving again in the US and banks are reported to
be short of loan officers, until recently thought to be a redundant breed.
This mirror-image feast and famine of loans and flotations would be viewed
by Germans as a typical symptom of Anglo-US short-termism. Companies rush
through a 'window' so their backers can find an 'exit'. Next year may be too
late. Ironically, the big market newcomer caught up in this tangle is the
UK's premier venture capital group, 3i, which has itself helped to float
more than 800 companies. But it is hard for a big company with a March
year-end to float any time other than summer.
Fortunately, most investors are ready to make room in their portfolio for a
substantial company with a good name and reputation. For scores of flimsy
minnows still hoping to cash in on the tail end of a boom, the outlook is
much less promising.

FT  11 JUN 94 / Midland Bank stops taking smaller rivals' cash cards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Midland Bank has dealt a blow to some of its smaller competitors in the Visa
credit card market by blocking the use of their customers' cards in its cash
machine network.
None of the issuers affected - Robert Fleming/Save &amp; Prosper, MBNA, and HFC
Bank, which runs the GM Card for Vauxhall - has its own cash machines.
HFC Bank said it had been given some warning that access to cashpoints was
going to be withdrawn, but neither Robert Fleming nor MBNA had been
notified.
Midland said the decision was 'purely commercial'. It had not notified all
the banks affected because they had not formally applied to join the
network. The move could be seen as a direct attack on some of Midland's most
serious rivals in the increasingly competitive UK credit card market. All
three issuers involved have been attracting much new business recently by
offering a range of incentives.
Robert Fleming is the worst affected bank, because the Visa network is used
not only by its credit card holders but also its current-account customers,
who use Visa cards as debit cards to access their accounts.
A Robert Fleming representative said the company was particularly upset that
it had not been informed of the decision, even after it came into effect,
and would be taking the issue up with the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank,
owners of Midland. HFC Bank said it was not unduly concerned at the change
as cash withdrawals were only a peripheral part of its credit card
facilities and not used by the majority of customers.
Visa said that although all banks in the Visa network were obliged to accept
foreign-issued cards in their machines, they were entitled to reject cards
issued by local competitors if they chose, and if this was made clear on the
machines.
Midland has not yet changed the logo on its machines to indicate that not
all Visa cards are accepted.
NatWest has never accepted Visa cards issued by anyone except itself,
Midland, TSB and foreign banks. Lloyds accepts all cards bearing the Visa
logo, and Barclays accepts all cards except the GM Card.

FT  11 JUN 94 / Government backs plan for Hualon Ulster plant: Executives
defend Taiwan group's reputation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL and LAURA TYSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BELFAST, TAIPEI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday fully endorsed the controversial plan by Hualon
Corporation of Taiwan to build a Pounds 160m textile plant outside Belfast,
but emphasised that it might withhold grant aid if the project failed to
match the owner's pledges.
An agreement paving the way for the start of construction in the next three
months was signed in Belfast yesterday between Hualon and the province's
Industrial Development Board. A parallel ceremony was held in Taiwan.
Hualon executives took the opportunity to defend both the company's
reputation and its ambitious plan to build its first manufacturing unit
outside Asia. The plant, which will supply synthetic fibre to low-cost
clothing manufacturers in Europe, is intended to provide products to compete
against imports from the Far East.
Doubts about the 1.5m sq ft plant arose after disclosures of court
proceedings against two Hualon executives over alleged share fraud. Other
textile makers have also queried the company's ability to succeed in a
European market suffering from overcapacity, and challenged Hualon's
forecast of 1,800 new jobs.
In Taiwan, Mr Oung Ta-Ming - the multi-millionaire who controls the Hualon
family empire from behind the scenes - made an unscheduled appearance
half-way through the ceremonies. He referred all business-related inquiries
to company executives, saying: 'I don't know  - you have to ask them. They
tell me what they are doing and I say okay.'
Hualon's president, Mr Liang Ching-hsiung, said the Northern Ireland project
was intended to upgrade product standards and to gain a foothold in Europe.
The investment would be made directly from the parent company in Taiwan, but
the group's unlisted Malaysian arm would play an important role in the
project, as its operations were similar to those planned for Belfast, Mr
Liang said.
In Belfast, Mr Andrew Oung, vice-chairman of Hualon, rejected suggestions
that the company's production and job forecasts were over-ambitious and
insisted that the recent court cases had no bearing on the company's
standing. He said Hualon was 'a decent company' and the allegations against
two of its executives had failed to harm its stock market standing in Asia.
Mr Tim Smith, Northern Ireland industry minister, said he had 'every
confidence' in the project.
He emphasised the phased nature of the nine-year project and said the Pounds
61m grant aid would depend on Hualon's objectives being met at each stage.
About 10 per cent of the total grant aid is related to job creation.

FT  11 JUN 94 / PM under pressure as Tories fear disaster in Euro-poll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major's position as prime minister was under fire again yesterday as
the Conservative party braced itself for a rout in the European elections.
In the wake of Thursday's five by-election defeats and amid fears that
Conservative representation in the European parliament will be reduced to
single figures, cabinet ministers moved quickly to shore up the prime
minister's position.
Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, said Mr Major had 'fought a tremendous
campaign', but 'people wanted to give the government a kick up the bottom'.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said the voters would
eventually give the government credit for taking tough decisions and keeping
its nerve.
However, Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor, said the government was 'deeply
unpopular'. He said he was 'not hopeful about Sunday night', when the
European results will be announced.
Rightwing backbenchers were careful not to criticise the prime minister
publicly ahead of the European election results. But Mr Major is expected to
face blunt criticism over the party's poor electoral performance when the
Commons reassembles on Tuesday.
Rightwing MPs said privately there would be demands for a radical
reappraisal of the government's approach to the European Union.
Sir Teddy Taylor, a leading Euro-sceptic, said the party would 'solve
nothing' by replacing Mr Major. But the voters had 'shown in the
astonishingly low turnout for the Euro polls that they are fed up to the
teeth with Brussels rule'.
Conservative officials said they had not given up hope of retaining more
than 10 of the party's 32 seats in the European parliament.
But Mr David Butler, the leading psephologist and fellow of Nuffield
College, Oxford, said the Conservatives would be left with no seats if the
Eastleigh result was replicated in the 84 mainland European parliament
seats.
Both main opposition parties claimed that the Eastleigh by-election, in
Hampshire, established their position as the main challengers to the
Conservatives in the south of England.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, whose Liberal Democrats overturned a 17,000 majority to
take the seat with a majority of 9,239, said the result was 'a devastating
humiliation for the government'.

FT  11 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Lloyds/C&amp;G
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The resilience of Lloyds Bank's shares since Wednesday's High Court ruling
on its bid for Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester suggests the market still believes
the deal will eventually go ahead. A similar signal comes from the
performance of C&amp;G's permanent interest bearing shares or PIBs. Their yield
premium over 15-year gilts has barely moved since Wednesday night's ruling.
Yet there is much at stake if the judge's negative verdict is upheld. Under
the deal as proposed, PIB holders stand to benefit not only from the bonus
paid to investors in C&amp;G, but also from the relative improvement in the
status of their investment.
Since building societies have no equity shares in issue, their PIBs, which
are irredeemable, stand pretty much at the bottom of the pecking order in
the event of a liquidation. Once ownership of the society is transferred to
a bank with an equity share capital, the relative ranking improves. Moreover
with interest then being paid gross, as is normal on subordinated debt, the
paper would have new appeal to overseas investors. Such thoughts saw the
yield on C&amp;G's PIBs move 40 basis points closer to that on gilts in the
immediate aftermath of the original announcement.
If the deal were blocked that gain would be reversed. Moreover the
repercussions would be felt elsewhere in the PIBs market where spreads,
particularly on issues by smaller societies, have narrowed in anticipation
of a broader industry restructuring. Doubtless there is money waiting to
snap up UK building societies, including some accumulated by Irish societies
anxious to expand in the UK. But it is unlikely to be spent if Lloyds and
C&amp;G cannot find a way round the judge's ruling.

FT  11 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Enterprise/Lasmo
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It would be easy to knock Lasmo's assessment that it is worth at least 180p
a share. Though the figure was produced by consultants DeGoyler and
MacNaughton, the key assumptions were provided by Lasmo itself. The
projected crude price of Dollars 17.50 in real terms is on the generous
side, while the discount rate of 10 to 12 per cent looks low. Use more
realistic assumptions and the net asset value comes tumbling down.
But such calculations of Lasmo's absolute value are of little interest to
the company's shareholders. Much more important is the company's relative
value vis-a-vis Enterprise Oil. Following yesterday's statement that it
would not underwrite a cash offer unless a third party entered the bidding,
the battle is increasingly likely to be decided by the relative value of the
two companies' paper. Altering the assumptions on crude prices or discount
rates makes little difference, as the companies' values would move up or
down in tandem.
Most independent analysts estimate Enterprise's net asset value at one and a
half times Lasmo's, which is exactly how Enterprise's current offer values
Lasmo. That, though, gives Lasmo shareholders no incentive to swap their
shares for Enterprise's. The larger company's problem is that it has little
room to improve its offer. It has failed to demonstrate any significant
value to be created from putting the companies together. A paper offer that
appealed to Lasmo shareholders would probably end up harming its own
investors.

FT  11 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: CU victorious
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A decade ago Commercial Union was down and almost out following its ruinous
attempt to expand in the US. Yet yesterday's agreement to acquire Groupe
Victoire of France for Pounds 1.5bn propels CU beyond any other UK composite
insurer in terms of market value and geographic spread. By buying 5 per cent
of the French life insurance market, and a smaller position in non-life
insurance, CU has staked a claim to sit at the top table in Europe with the
likes of Allianz and Union des Assurances de Paris. The question is whether
such a large acquisition is a stroke of genius or an act of hubris.
The deal has the merit of fitting CU's well established strategy of
expanding its life operations in continental Europe. With around 40 per cent
of premium income coming from the life side after the deal, CU will be a
more balanced insurer than any of its UK peers. If a higher proportion of
income from relatively stable life business improves CU's quality of
earnings, shareholders are unlikely to complain. The group's cost of capital
might also be reduced as a result. CU is not buying Victoire's reinsurance
interests, which provide a volatile return and would have reduced earnings
quality. In the longer term, building a European network should bring
economies of scale, such as cheaper reinsurance and shared development
costs. But a genuine single European insurance market is years away. Much
therefore depends on CU's ability to manage its new business in the short
term. While the French life insurance market is growing fast, Victoire's
network of sales agents will have to be nurtured - and probably expanded -
to keep up with the bancassurance companies. Its salaried sales force will
also have to be kept happy through the change of ownership. Meanwhile,
Victoire's non-life side is fighting from eleventh place in a highly
competitive market.
The record of cross-border European insurance mergers is not altogether
happy. Victoire itself suffered for its efforts to expand into Germany in
the late 1980s. Given its management record in recent years, though, CU has
probably earned the benefit of the doubt. The enlarged group will hardly be
awash with equity, which should keep management focused on the job in hand.
But by partially funding the deal with shares, CU will prevent its balance
sheet from looking over-stretched. It is also comforting that CU has had
every opportunity to examine Victoire's books. There seems little chance of
a nasty shock.
That leaves the question of price. The 30 per cent premium to net assets CU
is paying for Victoire is modest by the standards set a few years ago. After
the recent property shake-out in France, Victoire's stated net assets should
be fairly solid. The early stage of the French underwriting recovery means
the deal will almost certainly dilute earnings for at least the first year.
But any initial drag on earnings is insignificant when judged against the
potential rewards if the combination can be made to work. Should anything go
wrong, modest dilution will be the least of shareholders' worries.

FT  11 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Futures-related programs
boost Dow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
Blue chip stocks were shaken out of the doldrums yesterday despite a softer
tone in bonds, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 20.31 higher at 3,773.45, as
futures-related buy programs sparked the most robust upturn on Wall Street
in nearly a month. But the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 inched
just 0.81 ahead to 458.67.
However, only 222m shares were traded. The lacklustre volume probably
exaggerated the extent of the Dow's advance, which showed signs of flagging
during the afternoon but caught a second wind in the final hour.
In the secondary markets, the American SE composite hardly budged, climbing
a scant 0.66 to 441.84. But the Nasdaq composite jumped 5.37 to 734.25, as a
favourable outlook for semiconductor companies allowed computers stocks to
rebound from this week's sell-off.
The strength of the blue chips, after so many flat sessions, was surprising
in view of the morning's inconclusive economic report. The good news was
that producer prices last month dipped 0.1 per cent, with analysts
forecasting a slight gain. The bad news was that the core index, excluding
food and energy, jumped 0.4 per cent, rather stronger than expected.
The mixed signals on inflation disappointed a bond market in search of fresh
direction. As a result Treasury prices drifted moderately lower, and thus
provided little leverage for stocks. Nevertheless, equities showed
surprising strength, though there was no obvious justification for the
enthusiasm. The big gainers were stocks most likely to benefit from a
buoyant economy, a group which has languished over the past month.
Among the cyclicals, Caterpillar climbed Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 105 1/8
and Cummins Engine added Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 41 7/8 . Steel and
aluminium producers were in demand, partly in response to rising industrial
metal prices in the commodity markets, analysts said. Bethlehem Steel was
marked up Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 21 1/8 , Alcoa pushed Dollars 1 3/4
higher to Dollars 73 and Reynolds added Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 48 1/8 .
Energy stocks were in demand as well, with Mobil appreciating Dollars 1 1/8
to Dollars 82 7/8 and Chevron gaining Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 90 7/8 .
The technology sector benefited from a much needed boost from the
Semiconductor Industry Association's May book-to-bill ratio, which compares
shipments to orders. The keenly watched barometer matched expectations of
continued strength and encouraged investors to shop for bargains.
On the Nasdaq, Cyrix bounced back Dollars 1 to Dollars 27 and Novellus put
on Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 33 1/4 . On the Big Board, Compaq was up Dollars
1 at Dollars 35 3/8 and Texas Instruments Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 77 1/4  .
Meanwhile, PepsiCo was near the top of the NYSE's most active list for the
second day running, though yesterday the share price only dipped Dollars
3/8 to Dollars 31 1/8 . The previous session, the company's profits warning
touched off fears of sustained downturn in soft-drink sales.
Canada
Toronto recorded a small gain in relatively light trading. The TSE-300
composite index was up 13.72 points, or 0.33 per cent, to 4,210.51, for a
loss on the week of about 71 points. Winning issues edged losers by 371 to
358.
In another quiet session, trading volume was up slightly to 45.0m shares
from Thursday's 43.46m, while trading value was CDollars 499.5m compared
with CDollars 516m.
Advances were led by the mining group, which gained 1.81 per cent.
Brazil
Sao Paulo closed up three per cent in light trade after prices rallied for
the third day in a row on portfolio-squaring ahead of the options
settlements and optimism ahead of the adoption of a new currency on July 1.
The Bovespa index of the 56 most-active shares ended up 880 at 30,204
points. Turnover was CR414.4bn (Dollars 195.5).
Telebras TEL. SA, Brazil's most popular blue chip, was very volatile in late
trading. The preferred stock closed up 2.2 percent at CR86.50.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Stocks pulled back from two-year highs on Friday as profit taking closed a
bullish week writes Robert Patton in Tokyo.
The 225 average declined 7.60, after a three-day uphill run, to close at
21,395.18 in volume that soared to 1.1bn shares - the heaviest in 14 months
 -for a 2 per cent gain on the week.
After reaching a high of 21,559.81 shortly before the release of the Bank of
Japan's tankan survey, the index dipped to a low of 21,355.37 before
rebounding on support buying near the close. The tankan, although positive,
was not as strong as some had hoped and provided the reason for a wave of
futures-led profit-taking and closing of dealer positions.
In spite of the decline, gainers still led losers 527 to 508 with 155
unchanged.
The Nikkei 300 index slipped 1.88 to 309.72, while the first-section Topix
index fell 8.36 to 1,700.80.
In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose to 3.13 to 1,404.75.
Large-capital steel companies and shipbuilders continued to lead in volume,
but results were mixed. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries gained only Y1 to Y820
as 30.1m shares changed hands. Kawasaki Heavy Industries lost Y6 to Y482,
while Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries rose Y9 to Y500, both in active
trading.
Oki Electric, after three days of strong gains, gave up Y6 in the day's
third highest volume to close at Y783.
Major brokerage firms were mixed as profit-taking eroded some of the
previous day's gains. Of the Big Four, Nomura Securities slid Y50 to Y2,500
and Nikko Securities dipped Y30 to Y1,410. But Yamaichi Securities added Y4
to Y994 and Daiwa Securities rose Y10 to Y1850.
In Osaka the OSE average gained 16.59 to 23,647.23 in volume of 54m shares.
Roundup
With the exception of a strong performance from Kuala Lumpur the region's
markets were generally mixed yesterday.
KUALA LUMPUR climbed 3.6 per cent as strong demand continued for blue chips,
and the composite index closed up 35.26 at 1016.98, a week's gain of 5.3 per
cent.
Turnover was estimated at MDollars 1.23bn.
Idris Hydraulic was one of the most actively traded stocks, rising 56 cents
to MDollars 4.74, while Tenaga put on 50 cents to MDollars 14.30 and Telekom
90 cents to MDollars 19.90.
HONG KONG eased on rumours regarding the health of Chinese leader Deng
Xiaoping, and technical selling, which left the Hang Seng Index down 79.48
at 9,111.16. The market has fallen 1.3 per cent this week.
During the session the index tumbled through the 9,000 level as rumours
abounded regarding Deng Xiaoping's health, reports which were denied by the
Chinese authorities later in the day.
Bargain hunting in the afternoon helped to lift stocks with Sun Hung Kai
Properties finishing down 50 cents at HKDollars 50.00 and Henderson Land
dropping 25 cents to HKDollars 40.00.
SYDNEY saw early buying fade during the session, leaving the All Ordinaries
index off 7.3 at 2,069.4, a week's fall of 0.5 per cent.
Turnover was ADollars 492.7m.
Coles Meyer, the retailer, gained 9 cents to ADollars 4.36, reversing recent
falls on worries that Kmart Corporation's 20 per cent stake in the company
might be sold.
SEOUL fell broadly on continuing worries over the North Korean nuclear
issue, as further threats were made by the government in Pyongyang against
South Korea. The composite index lost 6.85 to 928.94 on the day and 1.5 per
cent on the wek.
Turnover was Won666.7bn.
TAIPEI rebounded after Thursday's 2.6 per cent fall led by rises in the
electronics sector. The weighted index rose 52.28 to 5,994.66, in modest
turnover of TDollars 52.9bn, for a week's decline of 0.8 per cent.
United Microelectronics ended limit up at TDollars 120.50, while Acer put on
TDollars 2.50 to TDollars 72.50.
BOMBAY rose after suffering some midsession profit-taking and the BSE
30-share index closed up 20.94 at 4,158.64, a week's improvement of 2.5 per
cent.
Associated Cement showed among the day's big gainers, rising Rp150 to
Rp4,015.

FT  11 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris preoccupied with Suez
sale of Victoire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street's morning gains had a limited effect on bourses, writes Our
Markets Staff.
PARIS fell again as investors waited for further developments in the Suez
disposal of its Groupe Victoire unit. After the close, Suez, off FFr8 at
FFr303, announced that it was in advanced negotiations on the sale of the
insurer to Commercial Union of the UK for approximately FFr12.5bn, less than
the market consensus of some FFr15bn.
The immediate reaction from analysts was that the deal was a disappointment
for Suez, which had been virtually backed into concluding the deal yesterday
following the withdrawal of a rival bidder, Generali of Italy, earlier in
the week.
The CAC-40 index ended off 7.67 at 2,020.72, a week's fall of 1 per cent, in
average turnover of FFr3.7bn.
Generale des Eaux remained weak, off FFr39 at FFr2,226 on the day and 7.6
per cent on the week. Rumours abounded and the group said that it had
instructed a stock market supervisor to investigate recent sharp share
movements.
FRANKFURT's carmakers weakened further, but most banks extended their
recovery after Tuesday's fall on loan loss rumours.
The Dax index rose 3.76 to 2,133.08 on the session, 0.7 per cent down on the
week, reviving to close at an Ibis indicated 2,143.58 by the end of the
afternoon. Turnover fell from DM6bn to DM5.3bn.
Volkswagen led carmakers down with a fall of DM7 to DM465.50 and Allianz was
the front running financial, up DM36 at DM2,474. However, lower down the
size scale, Deutsche Verkehrs-Bank dropped DM9.50 to DM210 after it forecast
a large loss on loans to the collapsed sports surfaces company, Balsam.
The big rise on the day came ahead of news. Viag's Klockner &amp; Co, said after
hours that it was taking a majority stake in Computer 2000, Europe's largest
distributor of computer peripherals; Computer 2000 had already risen DM63,
or 9 per cent to DM773.
AMSTERDAM prepared itself for the quotation on Monday of KPN, the post and
telecommunications group, which was partially privatised last week. The AEX
index ended up 1.45 at 406.71, a week's improvement of 1 per cent.
Nedlloyd was again in focus, up Fl 3.70 to Fl 71.20 as the group forecast
good earnings prospects for 1994. Hoare Govett yesterday raised its
recommendation from hold to buy, citing the share's recent underperformance,
low valuation and improved prospects for earnings growth.
Philips put on 60 cents to Fl 53.70 after concluding a Dollars 2.5bn
revolving stand-by credit facility.
ZURICH drifted on profit-taking, the SMI index losing 13.4 to 2,763.8, still
1.3 per cent higher on the week.
Against the trend, Ciba picked up SFr7 to SFr860 as an advisory committee
recommended the US Food and Drug Administration to approve a combination
drug for the treatment of hypertension. Sandoz continued to benefit from
positive comment from analysts earlier in the week, with a SFr6 rise to
SFr751.
MILAN was dominated by technical trading ahead of next week's end of the
monthly account and the real-time Mibtel index added 51 to 12,032 in muted
turnover.
Italcementi fell L176 to L16,095 after it said that its three-for-10 rights
issue would be priced at L7,500 a share.
MADRID followed Wall Street higher, the general index ending 2.22 higher at
325.51, its best of the day if fractionally lower on the week.
Turnover was Pta29.3bn. Banks featured, with Santander up Pta110 at
Pta5,020, but one of the biggest gains of the day came in Cofir, the holding
company, which rose Pta23, or 4.8 per cent to Pta503.
HELSINKI closed a disappointing week with the Hex index down 3.7 per cent,
and 21.9 lower on the day at 1,712.4. Outokumpu, the metals and mining
company, fell FM6.60 to FM85.20 as it added a rights issue to its results.
VIENNA continued to climb in heavy turnover, anticipating a 'yes' vote in
Sunday's EU referendum.
The ATX index closed 16.87 higher at 1,084.52, 6 per cent up on the week,
but traders warned that a 'no' vote could bring a heavy reversal on Monday.

FT  11 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets: Uncertainties on the fringe of
volatility - The Nordic markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With a strong economic recovery under way throughout the region, Nordic
shares should be doing better. But fundamentals have counted for little even
on the periphery of international volatility since US interest rates began
to climb. Nordic bourses have been in thrall to developments in
international bond markets, with equities tending to fall as bond yields
have risen and vice-versa.
Stock markets in Sweden, Finland, Norway and Denmark all reached their year
peak around late January and early February just before the US Federal
Reserve lifted interest rates for the first time. Since then the trend has
been downward, although it has been a modest rather than a dramatic decline.
In Finland and Sweden shares are still up slightly on the year, while the
fall in Denmark and Norway has been correspondingly small.
Nobody was expecting the Nordic stock exchanges to be able to repeat their
exceptional performance in 1993, when Finnish shares rose 91 per cent and
Denmark, the region's worst performer, climbed nearly 40 per cent. However,
most analysts would probably have expected shares to be higher than they are
today. The main problem has been the sharp fall in bond prices, which has
been exaggerated by the risk premiums associated with fringe markets.
The immediate outlook is not particularly encouraging and not just because
of the continuing tumult in the bond markets. Inflation has started to rear
its head again. Political uncertainties are also on the increase. Both
Sweden and Denmark are due to hold elections in the autumn while referendums
on membership of the European Union are scheduled in Sweden, Norway and
Finland for October and November.
Counterbalancing these influences is burgeoning economic recovery. For the
first time since 1990 all four countries will have positive economic growth
in 1994, led by Norway and Denmark where GDP may grow by as much as four per
cent. Company profits are rising strongly in most sectors.
In Finland and Sweden, the recovery is export-led and comes on the back of a
huge surge in corporate earnings. The earnings improvement has been
spectacular, reflecting weaker currencies, extensive cost-cutting, as well
as recovery in key markets.
First quarter figures from Sweden's big multinationals showed clearly how
strong the recovery has been. Many companies upgraded their full-year
forecasts, citing a faster-than-expected recovery in Europe, confirming
earlier expectations that 1994 is going to be one of the corporate sector's
best-ever years.
But Sweden, the biggest Nordic market, has had an uneven development in
1994. January's gains were wiped out by the end of March amid bond market
tumult and a spate of rights issues. A cautious recovery got under way in
April and May, supported by strong earnings reports. In June trading has
again been dominated by the rise in long-term interest rates, dragging
shares lower and leaving them just 3.6 per cent higher than they were at the
start of the year.
It is difficult to see the market making headway in the next few weeks, as
Sweden heads into the summer holidays and awaits six month figures due out
in August. Uncertainty is increasing ahead of the country's September
general election which - the polls suggest - will return a Social Democratic
government. If the victory materialises, it would be bad news for the market
in the short term as the party has promised higher taxes on capital gains
and dividends.
The EU referendums are also weighing on sentiment. With opinion polls
suggesting that both Norway and Sweden will say 'no' to the EU,
international investors, in particular, may be wary.
Denmark, never as volatile as its fellow Nordic markets because it has fewer
cyclical stocks and a smaller influence from foreign investors, will be less
influenced by these pressures. But the Danish market will have its own
uncertainties in the run-up to the general election which has to be held by
the end of the year.
Norway, too, may find it hard to make progress. Shipping markets are
depressed, particularly for very large tankers, and there is little support
from the oil price.
The nervous mood is likely to continue in the Nordic markets in the short
term. 'The worry is interest rates going up and money not coming into the
market on the back of it,' says Mr Peter Lawrence, head of Scandinavian
research at Kleinwort Benson in London.
That applies particularly to foreign buying which has done more than
anything to drive up share prices, particularly in Sweden and Finland, over
the last 18 months.
The short-term bearish mood is echoed by Mr Richard Davidson, European
equities strategist at Morgan Stanley in London. He is underweight on the
region because of the political uncertainties and signs of rising inflation.
He also believes much of the good news is already factored into prices.
In the longer term, the view is more positive, due to economic and earnings
recovery. Mr Klas Andersson at Goldman Sachs, taking a 12-month view,
expects Norway and Finland to rise by up to 20 per cent, and Denmark and
Sweden by 15 to 20 per cent.

FT  11 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: CU retreats
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
News that Commercial Union was to pay Pounds 1.46bn for French insurer
Groupe Victoire came towards the end of the session, although the shares
ticked off rapidly in the trading time left, closing 5 off at 533p. Further
losses in the region of 20 to 25 are likely when the market opens on Monday,
according to sector specialists.
There were no doubts about the strategic value of the deal, which had been
strongly rumoured all week, but the price was a disappointment; although not
excessively expensive, there had been hopes CU would have a free run after
other potential bidders dropped out of the race.
Analysts were also doubtful about the financing - a combination of debt and
around Pounds 500m of equity - particularly after last year's Pounds 430m
rights issue. The comment that there would be a dilutive effect on earnings
in the first full year did not help.
GRE, a possible switch for those looking to move out of CU, was up 8 at
178p.
Smith New Court, the securities house, was responsible for a bought deal in
Royal Bank of Scotland shares, buying 14m shares, 1.9 per cent of the issued
capital, at 402p and placing them with institutions at 406p. RBOS closed a
penny off at 414p with turnover at 28m.
J Sainsbury, Britain's biggest food retailer, at a presentation at
stockbroker SG Warburg, was reportedly giving a reassuring message of
improving margin growth, cost squeezing and signs of food price inflation
creeping back.
Mr Andrew Kasoulis at Warburg said: 'The sector's outperformed since the end
of January and I don't think it will stop here. The big superstore operators
now have a formidable format.' As in recent sessions, there was evidence of
some big institutional buying, with Sainsbury advancing 3 to 395p, Tesco 10
1/2 to 227 1/2 p, Argyll 6 1/2 to 247 1/2 p and Kwik Save 10 to 579p.
Good passenger figures excited interest in BAA and its price improved 21 to
950p.
P&amp;O retreated 6 to 652p as the chairman of Stena described the effect of the
price war between the two ferry operators as 'devastating'.
News that British Land had taken a 6.9 per cent stake in Bredero Properties,
which is the subject of a recommended buy out by its associate company
Slough Estates, sent Bredero shares sharply forward on hopes of a higher
offer being solicited. The shares ended up 2 1/2 at 13p, with British Land
up 2 at 391p and Slough off a penny at 240p.
Indications that there will be an early release for the consultation paper
on the rate of return that British Gas will be allowed to earn from its
transportation assets fuelled activity in the shares. The price moved up 15
to 293 1/2 p with a hefty 17m shares traded.
Demand for Wellcome continued, up 20 1/2 on the day to 594 1/2 p, after
Thursday's 22p rise. Volumes were higher than average at 2.5m, with interest
from the US on the back of recent buy notes.
Granada Group also saw another day's strong performance, bolstered by a buy
note from Smith New Court. The broker said that the 'exceptionally strong
cash generation throughout the group gives substantial scope for further
expansion.' It added that a Pounds 500m valuation of its 13.5 per cent stake
in BSkyB was worth an extra 100p a share. Granada shares gained 9 to 525p.

FT  11 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Cadbury retreats
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The fall-out from the PepsiCo profits warning on Thursday jolted several key
stocks across the food and drinks sectors. The US soft drinks and fast food
group warned that stiff competition in its home market, particularly from
cheaper colas, would keep second-quarter profits flat.
PepsiCo singled out the success of Cott, the Canadian producer of own label
cola for North American retailers, as one of the main reasons behind the
downturn. Cott has recently moved into the UK market, making cola for
Sainsbury, which was embroiled in a big row with Coca-Cola over accusations
of copying the famous Coke label. Worries over Cott's impact on the UK
market hit Coca-Cola's UK joint venture partner Cadbury Schweppes, the
shares sliding 13 to 452p.
Credit Lyonnais Laing took the opportunity to reiterate its sell
recommendation on the stock, arguing that should Cott's penetration in the
UK match that of its home market Canada, Cadbury's profit growth over the
next three years will be wiped out. But Strauss Turnbull, which brought out
a buy note on the stock recently, took a different view, pointing out that
Coca-Cola was matching and even beating Cott-produced cola on price in the
UK to protect its market share.
Also hit by the PepsiCo story was Grand Metropolitan, which runs the Burger
King fast food chain, although the shares managed a rally to close a penny
better at 426p. Bass retreated 5 to 515p on fears that PepsiCo will not now
proceed with the long-rumoured Pounds 400m purchase of Britvic of which the
UK brewer has a share. However, analysts said the fears were unfounded and
that the deal was currently getting Brussels approval.

FT  11 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Talk of fresh bid for Lasmo
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Rumours that a third party is poised to enter the fray of the
Lasmo/Enterprise bid battle added sparks to a hectic day and sent the
turnover of Lasmo shares soaring to 21m.
Marketmakers believed a big buyer moved in after fresh developments
yesterday in the vigorous fight between the two companies. First, Lasmo
issued a defence document which included an independent valuation which set
a net asset value of between 180p-211p - higher than that estimated by
Enterprise in its bid and sending Lasmo shares jumping 7.
Enterprise swiftly hit back saying that it did not intend to include a cash
element in its bid offer. Its shares immediately climbed, with investors
relieved that the bid would not drain Enterprise cash, and Lasmo stock began
to fall back.
But with Lasmo clocking up big volume and the price maintaining a gain of 3,
talk began to circulate in the market that the bid would soon take a further
twist with the arrival of a surprise suitor.
Sector experts await the crunch next week when Enterprise must say whether
or not it will raise the bid described by Lasmo as 'mean'. Lasmo closed up 3
at 142p. Enterprise added 10 to 410p with 2.3m shares traded.

FT  11 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity market responds to good gains
in gilts - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London's equity market moved up strongly yesterday, shrugging off the news
that the Conservative Party had suffered the expected defeats in five
by-elections and ahead of an expected thumping in the European elections.
The latest rise in the FT-SE 100 index, which closed at the day's best level
of 3,055.9, up 27 points on the session left the index up 58.1, or 1.9 per
cent, over the week. The equity market's second-ranked index, the FT-SE Mid
250, settled a more modest 9.2 up at 3,608.5, up 51.2 over the week. Much of
the impetus for the gain on the week came from much better than expected
data on UK manufacturing output released in mid-week.
The main driving force behind the equity market was the good showing by the
gilt-edged market, which was in positive territory all day, despite the poor
showing by the Government in the elections and a lack-lustre performance by
sterling against the D-Mark.
A further boost for the equity market, later in the day was a strong opening
performance by Wall Street in the wake of the US producer price numbers for
May.
Although closing well below the day's best levels the long gilt closed
around  1/4 firmer, having been up over a half-point at mid-session. March
trade data, seen as slightly disappointing by economists, had little impact
on the market.
One of the day's other plus points was the pick up in market activity as the
week drew to a close. Yesterday's turnover of 618.2m shares followed the
683.8m traded on Thursday and was given a substantial boost by a sizeable
bought deal in Royal Bank of Scotland shares, executed by Smith New Court,
the securities house, and a resurgence of trading activity in Lasmo, the
subject of a bid from Enterprise Oil.
Activity in non-FT-SE stocks accounted for 346.3m shares, or 56 per cent of
the day's total.
The session began with the equity market uncertain and down around 7 points
as marketmakers lowered their opening prices to head off any potential
selling from fund managers following the by-election defeats for the Tories.
News that Mr Nick Knight, equity market strategist at Nomura, the
Japanese-owned stockbroker, had lowered his mid-year forecast for the FT-SE
100 index to 2,500 and his end-year number to 3,000, also played a part in
the market's early caution.
The mark down proved only momentary, however, as a firm opening by gilts
triggered good institutional support as the market regained its confidence.
Share prices began to move sharply better towards midday and accelerated
strongly thereafter, eventually closing at the day's high.
The head of marketmaking at one of the leading UK integrated houses
described the days's performance as 'impressive' but emphasised that
sentiment in the equity market, still badly bruised by the recent bond
market sell off, 'will take some time to rebuild'.
The Lasmo defence document, including a higher-than-expected independent net
asset valuation, triggered an early upsurge in Lasmo shares and there was
intense speculation that a third party may be about to enter the arena.
Other oil shares were boosted by US buying.
The much-rumoured bid from Commercial Union for Victoire, the insurance arm
of French financial services group Suez, appeared in the late afternoon but
was too late to have much impact on CU shares.

<TEXT>
Equity derivatives bubbled into life with a rise in volume and a robust
performance by the June FT-SE contract against cash, writes Christine
Buckley.
Open interest - positions in the market - has increased and yesterday one
market specialist said the direction of least resistance had proved upwards.
June closed at a 6 point discount to cash although it had kept closer pace
for most of the session. Volume was a fairly strong 15,181 contracts.
Put buying was said to have been strong in options which indicates dealers
may be preparing for a fall in prices.

FT  11 JUN 94 / Markets Report: Pound stable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sterling yesterday shrugged off the disastrous by-election performance of
the ruling Conservative party to trade within narrow margins, writes Motoko
Rich.
The poor performance was widely expected, while a recent set of robust
economic data has also underpinned the pound. Sterling closed in London at
DM2.5142 against the D-Mark and at Dollars 1.508 against the dollar, from
Thursday's close of DM2.5206 and Dollars 1.5075.
The dollar also held its ground after the release of the US producer price
index, which was slightly above market expectations. The dollar finished at
DM1.6672 against the D-Mark from DM1.6721. Against the yen, it closed at
Y103.915 from Y104.155.
The markets were unmoved by yesterday's Tankan survey, the Bank of Japan's
report of business conditions, which showed a picture of gradual economic
recovery.
Analysts attributed sterling's firm performance to a forward looking market,
which was focusing on next week's retail sales and average earnings figures,
rather than election results. Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank
in London, said the market was expecting average earnings to rise from 4 per
cent to 4 1/4 per cent.
'An increase in average earnings will no doubt persuade the Bank of England
to argue for a tightening of UK monetary policy,' he said.
Higher interest rates, however, may not drive up the pound. 'The upside is
fairly limited for sterling because in the next few months, political
matters will dominate the agenda,' said Mr MacKinnon. 'So that may be a
deterrent for foreign investors.'
Positive headline data and a worse than expected underlying rise in the US
core PPI failed to jolt the dollar. 'The market fell asleep,' said Mr David
Cocker, economist at Chemical Bank.
The US bond market registered little change and Mr Cocker said the dollar
needed bond movement to take the lead.
Mr MacKinnon said the dollar had remained trapped within a tight trading
range ahead of next week's retail sales, CPI, industrial production and
current account figures.
The US currency also ignored more sabre rattling from Mr Mickey Kantor, the
US trade representative, who said the US goal was to open Japan 'one way or
another'.
The D-Mark was mixed in Europe ahead of tomorrow's European elections. The
German currency closed in London at FFr3.402 against the French franc from
FFr3.405 on Thursday. Against the lira, it finished at L965 from L967.5, but
it was stronger against the escudo and the peseta.
In the futures market, the December euromark contract traded 34,000 lots and
settled eleven basis points higher at 94.91. Short sterling volumes were low
at 15,000 and the December contract closed at 93.79, from 93.77.
German call money was quoted in a range of 5.00/5.10 per cent from 4.95/5.05
per cent on Thursday.
In the UK, the Bank of England provided late assistance of Pounds 115m to
the money market. Earlier the Bank had provided 400m liquidity after
forecasting a Pounds 600m shortage.

FT  11 JUN 94 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Copper back on gravy
train
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The copper market was back on the gravy train this week. By Tuesday's close
what remained of the previous Wednesday's shake-out at the London Metal
Exchange had been recouped, and after a Dollars 105 leap on Wednesday the
three months delivery price closed yesterday at Dollars 2,384 a tonne,
Dollars 42 below a fresh 21-month high reached in morning trading but still
Dollars 140.50 up overall.
Yesterday's early strength yesterday had been encouraged by the announcement
of a 12,850-tonne fall in LME warehouse stocks, to 366,200. The figure was
later corrected to 371,200 tonnes, but that still represented a 7,850-tonne
cut - the 24th in succession. Subsequent selling was more influenced by the
appearance of strong resistance above the Dollars 2,400-mark and the failure
of the New York market to maintain the uptrend than by disappointment at the
stocks revision, traders said.
Part of the 40 per cent fall in LME copper stocks since they reached a
16-year peak in February had been due to re-location, industry specialists
Bloomsbury Minerals Economics told the Reuter news agency. But copper demand
would exceed production by about 155,000 tonnes in the first half of 1994.
At the moment the aluminium market lacks such clear justification for its
recent strength, which was resumed this week with a Dollars 51.50 rise to
Dollars 1,406.50 a tonne for three months metal. LME stocks remain close to
their all-time record after registering a modest rise yesterday, instead of
the continued fall that many analysts had expected.
Dealers point out, however, that much of the LME stockpile is unavailable to
the market because it is tied up in long-term financing deals.
At the same time the effects of capacity cuts agreed by producers in the US,
the European Community, Canada, Russia, Norway and Australia are begining to
show through. Provisional figures published yesterday by the International
Primary Aluminium Institute indicate that total stocks of aluminium at
western world smelters, excluding finished end-products, totalled 3.645m
tonnes at the end of April 1994, compared with 3.69m in March.
The examples of copper and aluminium have also been encouraging other LME
markets to look on the bright side. Although additions continued to made to
the exchange's historically-high zinc stockpile, that metal managed an
Dollars 11 rise this week to Dollars 991.50 a tonne for three months
delivery. Meanwhile, in anticipation of stock-building by car battery makers
ahead of the northern hemisphere winter, traders pushed the three months
lead price up Dollars 18.75 to Dollars 540.25 a tonne.
At the London Commodity Exchange the robusta coffee market had another week
of sound and fury, but this time signifying very little. As investment fund
money ebbed and flowed in a basically thin market the September delivery
futures price fluctuated between Dollars 1,985 and Dollars 2,183 a tonne,
before ending Dollars 54 up on balance at Dollars 2,145.
'Many people are just standing aside because of the volatility,' one trader
told Reuter.
At the cocoa market, meanwhile, the September price dipped back below Pounds
1,000 a tonne in lacklustre trading. As the price surrendered Pounds 39 of
its recent rally to end at Pounds 995 a tonne, one dealer commented: 'It
will be hard for cocoa to pick up and it will probably move sideways for a
while. . . Even if it does pick up, there will be origin selling coming in
to put a lid on the market'.

facility

<TEXT>
Philips, the Dutch electronics group, has concluded a Dollars 2.5bn
revolving stand-by credit facility with a consortium of 53 international
banks. The deal, the largest facility arranged for a Dutch borrower, marks a
step forward in the company's efforts to restructure its debt.
The stand-by credit facility, arranged by CS First Boston, is a first for
Philips. It underlines the company's improved position in world capital
markets, after grappling with heavy corporate losses in the early 1990s.
Philips has been pursuing a policy of better asset management. It said
yesterday it would use part of its existing cash surplus to pay off the
remaining Dollars 800m of a Dollars 2bn loan taken out in 1990 to help fund
part of the 'Centurion' package of reforms and restructuring. This money is
expected to be paid back by the end of this month.
News of the credit facility helped Philips' shares to close up Fl 0.60 at Fl
53.70.
The electronics company said it felt able to reduce its cash surplus now
that it knew it could draw on large credit facilities if needed. There were
no specific plans for spending any of the Dollars 2.5bn which the company is
allowed to draw under the facility.
Philips' credit also includes a 'swing-line' facility for 'same-day'
borrowing of Dollars 500m, if necessary. This is usually a prerequisite for
starting a commercial paper programme, but Philips said it had no immediate
plans for such a move.
Philips will pay an annual fee of 0.1875 per cent for the availability of
the stand-by credit.

put up for sale

<TEXT>
Ziff Communications, the world's largest publisher of computer magazines and
a growing participant in the market for electronic information services, has
been put up for sale by the Ziff family.
The privately-held group, which has annual revenues of approximately Dollars
1bn and employs more than 4,300 people, could sell for between Dollars 2bn
and Dollars 3bn, analysts said.
'We don't know what the price will be, but it appears that there will be a
great deal of interest,' said Mr Steven Rattner of Lazard Freres, which has
been engaged to find a buyer.
Telecommunications companies as well as publishing and media companies
interested in the emerging market for electronic information services are
expected to be attracted by Ziff, analysts said.
Ziff Communications includes Ziff-Davis Publishing, publisher of PC Magazine
which has a paid circulation of more than one million. It is the largest
business magazine of any kind and ranks ninth among US magazines in terms of
advertising revenue.
The company also publishes several other magazines, trade newspapers,
newsletters and books relating to the computer industry and runs several
industry trade events and conferences.
The group also includes ZiffNet, an on-line information service about
computers, and Interchange, an electronic publishing venture due to be
launched commercially later this year. Interchange will carry The Washington
Post's new on-line service and electronic versions of several other
publications.
Mr William Ziff Jr, son of the founder of the family business, retired last
year after running the business for 38 years. His three sons, Dirk, Robert
and Daniel Ziff, and related trusts own approximately 90 per cent of the
business, with the remainder held by other family members.
'Publishing has been at the centre of our family's business interests for
two generations,' said Mr Dirk Ziff, co-chairman of Ziff Brothers
Investments.
'But since our father's retirement last fall, Robert and I have realised
that the company is not where we want to spend our careers. After consulting
with our brother Daniel and our father, it was clear that we should focus
where our skills and interests lie, in the investment field.'
Mr Rattner said that the Ziff family wanted to compete the sale with as few
transactions as possible. 'If it can be sold to a single buyer without
sacrificing proceeds - that would be a priority.'
The Ziff brothers said that the company would not be sold 'to just anybody,'
adding that they would not welcome bids from the company's main competitors,
International Data Group and CMP Publications.
K-III Communications, which owns about 50 consumer and trade magazines, said
it was interested in buying some of Ziff's businesses.

MIM Holdings, the Queensland-based metals and mining group, yesterday
announced a ADollars 416.8m (USDollars 306m) placement of new shares - the
first time in six years that the company has raised new capital via an
equity issue.
The shares being placed represent just under 10 per cent of MIM's issued
share capital.
The issue price was pitched at ADollars 2.925, a discount of more than 9 per
cent to Thursday night's closing price of ADollars 3.22. MIM shares fell six
cents, to ADollars 3.16, on news of the placement.
Mr Norm Fussell, MIM's managing director, said the funds would be used 'for
general corporate purposes, including the growth of the group's copper
business'.
The company has two important projects due to come on stream in the mid to
late 1990s: Ernest Henry, the rich copper-gold deposit in Australia, in
which MIM has a 51 per cent interest, and the Bajo de la Alumbrera deposit
in Argentina, in which MIM has a 50 per cent interest.

FT  11 JUN 94 / International Company News: Insurer advances into Europe -
CU reinforces recovery with big purchase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Commercial Union, the UK insurance company which was close to insolvency 10
years ago, yesterday signalled the full extent of its recovery by announcing
its planned acquisition of France's sixth biggest life insurance company,
Groupe Victoire.
The deal, expected to be finalised later this year, puts CU firmly among the
biggest European insurers and leaves it with a solid base in the Dutch,
French and UK markets.
More than any other UK company, CU is well placed to take advantage of the
expected liberalisation of the continent's insurance market, a process which
is expected to gather speed after the implementation of a new regulatory
framework next month.
However, above all the acquisition also marks a decisive turnround in CU's
fortunes since the early 1980s, when a combination of bad luck and bad
management left it with a reputation as the sick man of the insurance
sector.
Following losses of more than Pounds 100m (Dollars 150m) in 1984 and 1985, a
new management spearheaded a strategic shift in the group's business, It
reduced exposure to the loss-making US commercial liability business and
increased the emphasis on Europe, especially in life business, which was
seen as guaranteeing more stable and higher quality earnings.
Between 1990 and 1992, while its UK rivals experienced some of their worst
losses, CU escaped relatively unscathed, posting only one year of losses and
leading the return to profitability in 1992.
The acquisition of Victoire would further increase the proportion of
business represented by life operations, from 32 per cent to 40 per cent,
based on 1993 figures. CU's annual premium income will increase by more than
30 per cent as a result of the deal, confirming its position as the biggest
of the UK composite (general and life) insurance companies.
However, Mr John Carter, who took over as chief executive earlier this year,
said CU was not 'doing the deal just to get bigger but to increase
shareholder value'.
CU will pay FFr12.5bn (Dollars 2.2bn) for a company whose net assets are
valued at FFr9.5bn. The price compares favourably with some made for recent
acquisitions in the sector. The company believes Victoire's growth prospects
are good, especially in the French life market, which should be lifted by
the expected liberalisation of pensions legislation.
Premiums at Abeille Vie, Victoire's life subsidiary, rose 14.5 per cent in
1993, to FFr15.8bn, with about two-thirds of this generated by the rapidly
growing savings club, the Association Francaise d'Epargne et de Retraite.
Abeille Assurances, Victoire's non-life arm, is the 11th biggest non-life
insurer in France, specialising in small-scale commercial and personal
business. The company sells through a network of 1,200 exclusive agents, and
is strong in small provincial towns.
Mr Carter said CU, which will finance the deal through a combination of new
equity, debt and cash, would introduce tighter financial management to
improve returns from Victoire's financial assets.
'We think we can add value by setting the business according to very strict
financial parameters. They wouldn't have run the business on the basis of
shareholder value,' he said,
Additional cost savings could be achieved through linking the Victoire
companies with CU's existing French operations. These include L'Epargne de
France (a life insurance company distributing through a direct sales force),
a long-standing commercial lines business and a recently-formed direct motor
insurer.
At the same time, some central functions, such as investment management,
could be consolidated.
In the longer term, CU believes the size of its operations in Europe - which
already include Delta Lloyd, the Netherlands' fourth biggest insurer - will
also yield a number of advantages.
Mr Carter accepts there is a 'gradual convergence' in the European market,
and says CU is already 'finding more and more examples of ways in which we
can add value today'.
German, French, Italian and UK insurance companies tend to dominate their
national markets.
However, the implementation of new rules by the European Union is expected
to lead to greater competition over the next few years.
Implementation of the new rules will lead to the abolition on July 1 of laws
requiring minimum premium levels for some types of personal insurance. Also
from July 1, insurers will no longer need to submit the wordings of
insurance policies for approval by local regulators.
Similar restrictions on the market for commercial insurance have already
been lifted.

1.3bn

<TEXT>
Falconbridge, the western world's second-biggest nickel producer, has raised
CDollars 1.3bn (USDollars 946m) through an initial public offering and an
equity injection from Noranda, the Canadian resources group, which will
become its biggest single shareholder.
The public issue, which raised CDollars 751m, will be used mainly to reduce
the stake of Trelleborg, the Swedish metals group, to 29 per cent from 50
per cent.
Noranda, Falconbridge's joint owner since 1989, will reduce its interest
slightly, to 47 per cent from 50 per cent.
Trelleborg's and Noranda's stakes will be further diluted, to 28 per cent
and 46 per cent respectively, if the underwriters, led by Wood Gundy,
exercise an option to increase the size of the public offering over the next
month.
Demand for the issue has been strong, and the underwriters are expected to
take up their option. The issue has been priced at CDollars 18.50 per share,
towards the upper end of the range indicated by the underwriters.
Noranda's contribution totalled CDollars 561m. The company earlier this week
raised USDollars 300m in 10-year debentures to help finance its new
investment in Falconbridge.
Falconbridge will use the extra funds to reduce its CDollars 1.9bn debt. The
improved balance sheet will facilitate efforts to increase its one-third
stake in the USDollars 1bn Collahuasi copper project in Chile, and to
finance the proposed Raglan nickel/copper mine in northern Quebec.

Balsam was Procedo's biggest client, and bankers say that up to 75 per cent
of invoices it took as collateral on loans to Balsam may be worthless.
Procedo owes banks more than DM1.5bn (Dollars 899.6m).

FT  11 JUN 94 / International Company News: Cola warriors identify new enemy
 -PepsiCo is being hit by an own-label maker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The expression 'cola wars' has passed into common use to describe the
perennial spats between the world's two leading cola brands, Coca-Cola and
Pepsi-Cola.
However, the phrase took on new meaning on Thursday when PepsiCo, US
manufacturer of Pepsi-Cola, delivered a profits warning to Wall Street.
Second-quarter earnings would be virtually flat, the company said, and one
reason for that was a fall in prices in the US cola market. But it was not
the traditional enemy, Coca-Cola, that was doing the damage. It was
own-label cola supplied by Cott, the Canadian maker of store-branded foods
and drinks.
PepsiCo's share price dropped like a stone on the news: it was off 13 per
cent at one point, before recovering a little to close 9 per cent down. Why?
Because investors were painfully reminded of 'Marlboro Friday' - that day in
April last year when Philip Morris, the US food and tobacco group, had to
slash the price of its best-selling Marlboro cigarettes to win back market
share from cheaper products.
The fear underlying investors' response to price-cutting by big
manufacturers goes further than concern over the immediate impact on
profits.
Developments like these reinforce worries that the worth of famous brands is
declining because consumers are become more concerned about getting good
quality at a low price than about the name on the product.
A powerful example of the trend can be seen in the UK, where cola supplied
by Cott to J. Sainsbury, the UK's biggest food retailer, sells more than
Pepsi-Cola and Coca-Cola combined because it is apparently of comparable
quality, yet retails at virtually half the price.
So could June 9 1994 go down in history as 'Cola Thursday'? One argument
that suggests it might is to look at Cott's rapid expansion. The company has
grown phenomenally by supplying food and drinks to retailers who want to put
their own names on the bottles, packets and cans.
Cott's annual sales have rocketed from CDollars 43m to CDollars 665m
(USDollars 485.4m) in the past five years. Over the same period, its share
of the Canadian take-home soft drinks market has grown to 28 per cent. Now
it is spreading into the US, Australia, South Africa and - after signing a
distribution agreement with Cadbury Schweppes of the UK  - into Europe, too.
Some Wall Street analysts yesterday played down the threat to PepsiCo's US
market. Mr Joseph Doyle at Smith Barney Shearson said comparisons with
'Marlboro Friday' were unjustified, because the circumstances were
different.
US manufacturers of premium brand cigarettes had driven up their prices for
years to deliver earnings growth to shareholders, leaving themselves highly
vulnerable to attack by low-cost rivals. The US soft drinks market, however,
was highly competitive - prices had not changed in 10 years.
Mr Marc Cohen of Goldman Sachs agreed, saying the price differential in the
US between PepsiCo's products and Cott's lines - typically, about 20 cents
on a two-litre bottle of cola - was too narrow to raise fears of a bruising
price war. Although the price differential was greater outside the US, he
said, international soft drink earnings accounted for barely 5 per cent of
PepsiCo's operating income.
Even so, Cott's growth is due not so much to the fact that its products are
cheaper for consumers, but because they are more profitable for retailers.
Unlike Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, it does not spend vast amounts on advertising
and marketing to promote its name, so it can afford to sell its goods to
retailers at a much lower prices.
Mr Gerald Spencer, Cott's chairman and chief executive, said yesterday: 'The
bottom line is that our product sells to retailers at around Dollars 3.25 a
case (of 24 12oz cans) and theirs sells for Dollars 5 a case or more. If the
products are of equal quality, why should retailers pay more?'
PepsiCo was also playing down the threat, saying soft drink prices were down
by only 2 per cent, and that most of the profits shortfall in the second
quarter was due to tough competition in its fast food businesses, Pizza Hut
and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
PepsiCo acknowledged that Cott's product had a price advantage, but said its
research indicated consumers were still prepared to pay a premium for the
assurance of quality that came with a product they knew.
'Consumers still prefer to buy a branded product. They don't want to walk
around with Brand X in their hand,' it said.
Cott's Mr Pencer disagreed. 'Consumers are smarter now than they were 20
years ago,' he says. They were no longer prepared to pay a 'brand tax' - the
extra costs of hiring rock stars and the like to promote and sustain a
brand's image. 'You can only pay so long for an icon.'

computer distributor
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Klockner, a trading subsidiary of Viag, the acquisitive German conglomerate,
is to take control of Computer 2000, one of Europe's leading distributors of
software, hardware and networking components.
Agreement had been reached with a group of shareholders to buy a majority
stake, the bidder said on Friday. Neither company could be reached for
further comment.
Two insurance companies, Nordstern and Colonia, together hold more than 25
per cent of Computer 2000; 21 per cent is held privately by Dr Arend Oetker;
and the management and staff hold a further 10 per cent.
Computer 2000 has been expanding aggressively, but has suffered from sharply
shrinking margins.
Earlier this month it announced plans for a five-for-one rights issue.
Shareholders were told at this month's annual meeting that although turnover
had risen almost 40 per cent to DM1.94bn (Dollars 1.16bn) in the first six
months of the current year, pre-tax profits were up only 7.6 per cent at
DM39.5m.
Analysts have forecast further tightening of gross margins as competition
sharpens.
Klockner, which has a mixed portfolio of businesses, has also had its share
of troubles, stemming mainly from difficulties in the steel business, which
started in 1992 with the near-collapse of Klockner Werke, the diversified
steel group. Trade in machine tools has also generated losses. No recent
results figures are available.
Following a cost-cutting programme which started last spring, the company
has turned to acquisitions. Last autumn, it took a majority stake in Roder,
which claims to be the world's leading manufacturer and hirer of tents and
marquees.
In April, it bought control of Montana, which specialises in metal cladding
for the construction industry.

NKr54m

<TEXT>
Bergesen, Norway's largest shipowner, yesterday reported a steep fall in
pre-tax profits for the first four months, to NKr54m (Dollars 7.5m) from
NKr212m in the same period last year, reflecting weaker markets for tankers
and LPG carriers.
The company was uncertain about the outlook for the rest of the year. 'No
significant change is expected in the tanker market this summer. If break-up
(scrapping) activity continues, there could be an improvement in the
autumn,' it said.
Group operating revenue fell by NKr81m to NKr865m. Operating profit, before
depreciation costs, was reduced by NKr83m to NKr182m.
Taking depreciation costs of NKr212m into account, against NKr191m, Bergesen
fell to a loss of NKr30m at the net operating level, from a profit of
NKr74m.
The result was bolstered by foreign-exchange income of NKr124m against
NKr91m last year.
Tankers suffered an increase in operating losses, to NKr104m from NKr69m,
while LPG carriers saw operating profits cut by more than half to NKr51m
from NKr121.

FT  11 JUN 94 / UK Company News: C&amp;G rules out early statement over court's
ban on Pounds 1.8bn bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society yesterday ruled out making any
announcement for 'several weeks' on its response to a High Court ruling on
Wed-nesday barring the terms of Lloyds Bank's Pounds 1.8bn bid.
The statement appeared to contradict signals from Lloyds that it would like
to be able to say something concrete by the end of next week.
Bankers said Lloyds was confident that it would be able to come up with a
proposal that both satisfied the court and would be true to the spirit of
the original cash offer to the society's members.
Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester ruled out suggestions that it would consider issuing
preference shares to customers in lieu of a cash payment.
However, it refused to speculate on alternative ways of getting around the
judgment, such as providing a payment to customers who agreed to transfer
their savings to non-voting deposit accounts.
In a letter sent to its 1.4m customers yesterday, the society advised that
no-one should close any of their mortgage or investment accounts for fear of
jeopardising a potential payment under a revised offer.
It expressed 'great disappointment' in the judgment and said the ruling came
in spite of 'strong legal advice' that the offer was permitted under the act
from two QCs - Mr Jonathan Sumption and Mr Richard Sykes.
The society stressed that its delay at least into July of an announcement on
any revisions to the Lloyds offer was unrelated to its short-term decision
to prevent any new customers from opening accounts.

FT  11 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Burford pays Pounds 94m for the Trocadero -
Nigel Wray acquires landmark property in London's West End
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Trocadero, the landmark property in London's West End, has been sold to
Burford Holdings for Pounds 94m in the largest property transaction in the
City this year.
It was sold by the receivers to the collapsed Power Corporation.
The building is situated next to Piccadilly Circus on what is supposedly the
busiest walkway in Europe. It has already been through three owners since
its redevelopment in 1984, and at the peak of the property market was worth
about Pounds 250m.
KPMG Peat Marwick, the receiver, put the Trocadero on the market in October
at a target price of Pounds 100m, and received 'half a dozen' firm offers -
primarily from south-east Asian investors. Local interest was limited.
The buyer, Burford, is the rapidly-growing property group which purchased a
Pounds 103m property portfolio from Ladbroke in February. It is run by Mr
Nigel Wray, an entrepreneur who has been involved in companies including
Carlton Communications and The People's Phone, and Mr Nick Leslau, who has
headed the company since its March 1987 flotation.
Burford has considerable expertise in resuscitating distressed properties,
such as Manchester's Piccadilly Plaza, but it has taken an enormous
challenge in trying to convert the Trocadero's visitor throughput into hard
cash.
Success has eluded previous owners. Developed by the electricity industry's
pension fund in 1984, the Trocadero was sold on to Brent Walker and Power
Corporation. It financially crippled the two groups, and their bankers who
lent about Pounds 170m against the development.
Nor was it an easy property to sell. Mr John Stephen, investment partner at
selling agents Jones Lang Wootton, said: 'It is as much an entertainment
business as a real estate investment'. It therefore did not appeal to
institutional investors.
Yet its statistics are extraordinary. The Trocadero attracted about 14m
people last year, of which close to half spent nothing and the average
person just Pounds 5.
It has a number of successful tenants. A 450 sq ft sweet shop is selling
around 3 tons of confectionery a week, while Planet Hollywood is said to be
pushing through 10 covers a day on its 350 tables.
However, it also has 119,000 sq ft of vacant office and retail space, or 29
per cent of its total 411,000 sq ft of lettable space. Mr Nick Leslau,
Burford's chief executive, said: 'We should be able to do better. We have a
lot of experience with buildings that have been badly managed.'
The Trocadero is generating Pounds 8.6m in rental income, representing a
yield of around 9 per cent. Burford plans to invest around Pounds 7m on
restructuring and refurbishing the property.
It will convert the bulk of the building's 115,000 sq ft of office space
into leisure, to emphasise its role as an entertainment centre. The existing
leisure areas are 90 per cent let.
The acquisition increases the value of Burford's gross assets to Pounds
417m. The purchase will be funded through cash and debt, and will increase
Burford's gearing from 37 per cent to 75 per cent. That remains well within
the management's self-imposed 100 per cent limit.

FT  11 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Park Food rises 15% and buys competitor for
Pounds 10m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Park Food Group, which specialises in the sale of Christmas hampers,
yesterday reported record annual profits and announced the acquisition of a
competitor.
For the year ended March 31 pre-tax profits rose by 15 per cent to Pounds
11.8m while sales were more than 18 per cent ahead at Pounds 137.3m (Pounds
116.1m).
Earnings per share increased from 4.43p to 5.04p and a recommended final
dividend of 1.567p makes a 2.4p (2p) total.
The group is paying Pounds 10.5m cash for the hamper business of Heritage
Food Group (UK), a privately owned Middlesbrough company. It is acquiring no
net tangible assets; the consideration represents goodwill in the form of
agent and customer lists, and hamper orders.
Pre-tax profits from the Heritage hamper business, which has 12,000 agents,
were Pounds 500,000 last year. The acquisition takes the total number of
hamper agents at Park to 90,000.
Park claims to have 40 per cent of the hamper business, which supplies boxes
of groceries to lower income groups at Christmas. The average spend per
customer last year was up 11.9 per cent at Pounds 169, and growth is
expected to continue.
Customers start paying for the hampers 45 weeks in advance, giving the group
a strong cashflow and high interest payments. However, lower rates led to a
decline in interest receivable last year from Pounds 2.53m to Pounds 2.02m.
Mr Clifford Finch, operations director, outlined the group's planned move
into high technology food processing, entitled Project Q, on which it spent
Pounds 4m last year.
A factory is being built to apply a new microwave technology to break down
and restructure potatoes without the use of chemicals. This would mean that
natural flavourings could be added. Production from the new plant should
begin early next year.
COMMENT
Park has made an outstanding success of the modern form of the corner shop
Christmas club, which it strengthened further through acquisition yesterday.
There seems plenty of room for more growth. While it sells more than 1m
hampers a year, it estimates there are 13m homes in its target market. A
question mark hangs over the move into potato processing, about which the
company proved reticent yesterday. Pencilled in profits of Pounds 15.5m give
a prospective multiple of more than 20 - a good premium that leaves no room
for error in the mysterious Project Q.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
As indicated in January at the time of its proposed rights issue, share
subscription and capital reorganisation, Carlisle Group, the property
services company, incurred increased pre-tax losses for 1993.
On turnover of Pounds 4.89m (Pounds 5.15m), including Pounds 1.47m (Pounds
1.66m) from discontinued operations, losses amounted to Pounds 2.86m against
Pounds 947,000 in 1992.
Losses per share deepened from 2.8p to 10.5p. The directors said it was a
priority to restore dividend payments as soon as possible.
Mr Nigel Wray, chairman, said the group now had a solid balance sheet with
substantial cash resources and was 'well placed to take advantage of some
very interesting opportunities'. He was optimistic about the next few years.

Turnover of A Cohen &amp; Company was little changed at Pounds 78.2m, against
Pounds 78.4m, but this manufacturer of non-ferrous metal ingots suffered
pre-tax losses of Pounds 522,000 for 1993, compared with profits of Pounds
215,000.
The directors said that the long-awaited revival in the fortunes of
aluminium had eventually arrived and, on the basis of results so far, a
return to profitability was expected for the 1994 first half.
In view of the losses the directors do not recommend any dividend payment
for the year (6.8p). Losses per share were virtually doubled at 61.1p
against 31.7p on a net basis.

FT  11 JUN 94 / UK Company News: British Land takes 7% Bredero stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Land yesterday raised the stakes in Slough Estates' attempt to
privatise Bredero Properties, by acquiring a 7 per cent stake in the
property developer at above the offer price.
Mr John Ritblat, chairman of British Land, said 'the stock become available,
and there was no downside, so we thought we ought to have a look at it'.
British Land bought 2.5m shares, at 11p, from Scottish Amicable. The price
compares with Slough's current cash offer of 10p. Bredero's share price rose
2 1/2 p to 13p yesterday.
Mr Ritblat said his primary interest was in Bredero's Buchanan Centre retail
development site in Glasgow. Bred-ero's other large asset is the site for
Centre West (East) in London's Hammersmith.
A number of private shareholders, controlling around 10 per cent of the
company, have already undertaken to block the bid, which requires approval
from 90 per cent of shareholders.
British Land is also unlikely to accept, and Slough may be forced to either
lower the acceptance threshold, or raise the price, before its offer closes
next Thursday.
Slough would need to acquire at least 75 per cent of Bredero to gain tax
benefits from its losses, which amounted to more than Pounds 100m, over the
past 3 years.
Slough paid Pounds 14.6m for its 49.6 per cent stake in Bredero back in
December 1986.
After asset disposals to cover falling valuations and rising debt, Bredero
now has a net negative value of Pounds 3.4m, and the Slough offer values it
at Pounds 3.75m. This compares with an asset value of almost Pounds 100m, at
the peak of the property market.

FT  11 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Float values VCI at Pounds 58.3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VCI, one of the UK's largest independent publishers of videos and
pre-recorded music, has decided to go ahead with its planned flotation
despite current market uncertainties and less than overwhelming appetite for
new issues.
The issue price of 150p capitalises VCI at about Pounds 58.3m, a shade below
the Pounds 60m value hoped for.
The float, designed to raise a net Pounds 28m for the company, mainly to pay
off debt from a management buy-out in 1989, has been fully underwritten by
Samuel Montagu with James Capel as broker.
VCI, which pioneered the sell-through video market, selling rather than
renting video cassettes, has rights to more than 1,000 titles in both video
and music - including Thomas the Tank Engine, Sooty and Mr Bean. It is also
about to move into personal computer software with games and educational
titles.
In 1993 VCI made operating profits of Pounds 5.9m before exceptional items
on turnover of Pounds 59.8m. In 1992 operating profit fell from Pounds 5.2m
to Pounds 2.3m largely because of problems at Strand Magnetics, its
manufacturing arm now disposed of and write-offs on childrens' programming
following the entry of Disney into the market.
At the issue price the historic price earnings multiple is 13.3 times based
on pro forma earnings per share of 11.3p for 1993. The notional gross
dividend yield at 150p is 4.6 per cent representing a notional dividend
cover of 2.1 times.
Mr Stephen Ayres, chief executive of VCI, said the group's overall share of
the UK video sell-through market was 12.5 per cent for the five months to
end-May.
The decision to go ahead was helped by the fact that most of the significant
video companies are part of large media groups and that the sell-through
video market is continuing to expand.
VCI, as a holder of rights, seems reasonably well poised to be involved
whichever way technology takes the 'multi-media revolution'.
The offer closes on June 17, with dealings due on June 23.

FT  11 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Stagecoach makes Pounds 6m Western Scottish
bid
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Stagecoach, the provider of local bus services, has made a recommended share
offer for Western Scottish, the transport service operator based in
Scotland, valuing the company at some Pounds 6m.
Stagecoach is offering 3.17m shares on the basis of 317 of its own shares
for every 1000 Western. Accepting shareholders may elect to receive up to
36p in cash with the balance in new Stagecoach shares.
Western, which since privatisation in 1991 has traded at a loss - this
amounted to Pounds 372,000 pre-tax for the year ended January 2 1994 -
employs some 830 staff and operates 340 coaches and buses.
Directors said the acquisition would add Pounds 15m to Stagecoach's turnover
and would see the company 'become the largest operator of buses and coaches
in Scotland'.

FT  11 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Riva tumbles into Pounds 2.2m deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REG VAUGHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Following the warning in January of a substantial loss for 1993, Riva Group,
the USM-traded Lancashire-based supplier of electronic point of sale
systems, yesterday announced a pre-tax deficit of Pounds 2.2m, writes Reg
Vaughan.
Mr Peter Giles, chairman, said the loss - which compares with a profit of
Pounds 134,000 - reflected significant trading losses in Spain, Denmark and
France. In view of these the balance sheet was significantly depleted.
The chairman said that trading in continental Europe had been hit by the
continuing recession. However, the UK operations remained profitable. Group
turnover declined from Pounds 59.4m to Pounds 54m.
The chairman said that liquidity remained healthy and although gearing was
high, with the continued support of the banks, the depleted balance sheet
was not expected to affect operations this year.
As losses continued in continental Europe in the first half of the current
year, Mr Giles said he expected 1994 'to be a year of rationalisation and
consolidation.'
In the UK the year had started in line with expectations, with turnover
stable and costs generally under control, but with margin pressure on
hardware sales, Mr Giles said.
Borrowing costs fell to Pounds 695,000 (Pounds 879,000). Losses per share
were 8.6p (0.2p earnings) and there is again no dividend.

FT  11 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Welsh Water to launch cost savings scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Welsh Water is believed to be considering a substantial cost-cutting
programme to be announced after July 28, when it will be allowed to reveal
price increases set by the industry regulator for the next five years.
The group is thought to be examining proposed voluntary job cuts of 10 to 15
per cent in the core utility division. This employs roughly 3,000 people.
The water sector as a whole is expected to come under increasing pressure
for cost savings as part of the current price review. Anglian Water recently
announced plans to cut 900 jobs - or 17 per cent of its utility workforce
over the next two years.
Welsh's record on cost-cutting so far had been solid if undynamic, said one
analyst. 'They would want to announce further controllable cost savings of
at least 10 and possibly 15 per cent as early as possible following the
results of the review,' he said.
The speculation followed Welsh's announcement of a 7 per cent drop in
pre-tax profits to Pounds 144.2m for the year ended March 31, on turnover 34
per cent ahead to Pounds 512.1m.
Profits had been hit by a Pounds 7.5m loss on discontinued operations and a
swing from a Pounds 9m interest gain to a charge of Pounds 2.6m. At the
operating level, Welsh increased profits by 16 per cent - including the hit
on discontinued businesses - to Pounds 146.4m.
The utility increased operating profits by 12 per cent to Pounds 148.8m. Mr
Graham Hawker, chief executive, said measured consumption had held up well.
Operating costs had increased by 3 per cent.
Welsh said that 1993-94 had been a year of restructuring for the unregulated
businesses. The lossmaking pipeline maintenance business had been closed,
and the company said it expected the Pounds 7.5m exceptional charge to cover
all costs.
Acer, the engineering consultant acquired in February 1993, had reduced
costs and been refocused on its main markets. While this had disrupted
business, order books remained strong. Acer contributed operating profits of
Pounds 5.1m on sales of Pounds 130m for the year.
The final dividend was raised by 8 per cent to 8.45p, for a similarly
increased total payout of 25.4p (23.5p). Earnings were 14 per cent lower at
89.2p (104p).
COMMENT
Welsh remains one of the financially strongest of water companies with net
cash of Pounds 55m. While expected to breach the gearing barrier by the end
of this year, it is still likely to stay at the top of the financial league.
Dividend cover is not expected to fall much lower than 3.5 times. There are
still small questions over Acer, however, which is not expected to move
forward this year. In the end, everything now hangs on the current price
review. If it gets even a zero increase, this would be good news. Forecasts
are for Pounds 155m, with a further 8 per cent dividend increase to 27.5p.

FT  11 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Enterprise rules out underwritten cash -
Lasmo's final salvo brings in independent valuation of reserves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Enterprise Oil yesterday ruled out an underwritten cash alternative in its
hostile all-paper bid for rival explorer Lasmo, as the target company sought
to prove that its value was substantially higher than the Pounds 1.3bn on
offer.
The way is still open, however, for Enterprise to repackage the all-paper
offer before the deadline next week on the back of a higher share price, or
introduce a cash sweetener. This latter route appears unlikely, given
concerns over weakening the financial strength of an enlarged group.
Enterprise might also consider increasing the attraction of its bid by
raising the dividend promised to Lasmo shareholders. Currently, they are
offered the equivalent of 1p per Lasmo share for three years against
Enterprise's 16p payment to its own shareholders.
Enterprise has reserved the right to offer cash if there is an alternative
bid.
Whichever route Enterprise chooses, it is restricted by the concerns of its
own shareholders. 'It has limited room for manoeuvre and not much scope to
increase the number of shares,' said one institutional investor.
'If they can attract the other side by a bit of financial engineering then I
am relaxed.'
Enterprise's shares, which jumped by 25p following its announcement, closed
10p higher at 410p. Lasmo finished the day 3p up at 142p.
Enterprise's announcement followed Lasmo's final shot in the war of words.
Under takeover rules, Lasmo cannot release any new information after
yesterday.
Lasmo announced that an independent assessment of its reserves gave a net
asset value per share of between 180p and 211p, against Enterprise's offer
which values them at 132p on last night's close. This was based on a Brent
Oil price projection provided by Lasmo to the US-based petroleum
consultants, DeGoyler and MacNaughton, who carried out the valuation. This
assumed Brent prices of Dollars 15 a barrel in 1994 rising to Dollars 17.50
in 1996, and a nominal discount rate of between 10 and 12 per cent.
Lasmo also showed an upside case, which assumed average oil prices of
Dollars 2 higher. On this basis the valuation range was between 216p and
252p. In late trading yesterday Brent for July delivery was quoted at about
Dollars 16.40.
Mr Joe Darby, Lasmo's chief executive, admitted the price range was high
compared with assumptions in the UK. However, companies such as Shell, and
US analysts in general, were looking for higher price ranges than UK
observers.
The valuation showed proven and probable reserves of oil and oil equivalent
of 1.1bn barrels. The net asset per share valuation also takes account of
possible reserves - considered to be significantly higher risk - of some
262m barrels of oil and oil equivalent. These represented about 8 per cent
of the total valuation, said Mr Darby.
The company sought to crush once and for all allegations that it could not
fund future commitments, by setting out sources and uses of cash to 1996.
This showed Lasmo had a Pounds 435m cushion between its funding and
requirements. The group projected net year-end debt would rise from Pounds
540m in 1994 to Pounds 645m in 1995, falling to Pounds 415m in 1996 - 37 per
cent gearing.
Robert Fleming, Enterprise's adviser, said the valuation figures were
misleading by including possible reserves. 'Every way they go they are
looking for ways to boost their numbers in a desperate attempt to avoid
falling to Enterprise's offer', the merchant bank said.
Mr Rudolph Agnew, Lasmo's chairman, said shareholders had the right to know
about the company's potential. Most of the 'blue sky element', as Mr Agnew
described Lasmo's exploration potential, had not been included in the
valuation. 'We think the valuation is Rolls-Royce', he said.

FT  11 JUN 94 / Homo stingius on the town: Central bankers are at the peak
of their power. But can they stay there
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This has been a banner week for anthropologists. They have been able to
observe a singular concentration and migration of one of mankind's more
influential subspecies: the central bank governor.
The Bank of England's 300th birthday celebrations brought a record 110
serving governors to London for a gala concert on Wednesday and a special
symposium on central banking the following day.
This weekend, the extended posse of central bankers (the Bank is open to
suggestions for a more appropriate collective noun) moves to Basle for
Monday's annual meeting of the Bank for International Settlements in Basle.
If the spotlight is on top central bankers, it is for a good reason. These
guardians of the world's monetary and financial systems have more influence
than for a generation.
This new-found clout will not be immediately apparent this weekend. The
Basle gathering, one of the great annual events of the central banking
world, has echoes of a calmer, bygone age. For once, serious work is put to
one side. Bank governors and their officials, often with spouses in
attendance, glide bonhomously from lunch to cocktails to dinner, perhaps
exchanging the odd word on the need for fiscal austerity and financial
prudence. Many will find that their biggest problem is coping with the
compulsory second helpings so liberally served in the ho-tels clustered
around Basle's main railway station.
On show will be the old clubby, male- dominated world of central banking.
Only Austria, Finland and Poland have women central bank governors. The
guardians of the world's monetary and financial systems are a quietly
spoken, sober-suited bunch, aged mainly between between 50 and 70. They are
gossipy among themselves but cultivate a (frequently false) aura of
discretion towards outsiders.
Contrary to appearances, central bank governors come from varied
professional backgrounds. Until 1990, Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank
president, was a senior Bonn government official who in his youth had
aspired to be a priest. Mr Wim Duisenberg, head of the Netherlands national
bank, is a former socialist finance minister. Mr Donald Brash, the
innovative head of the New Zealand central bank, was once managing director
of the New Zealand Kiwifruit Authority. Others, notably Mr Eddie George of
the Bank of England and Mr Yashusi Mieno, governor of the Bank of Japan,
have been central bankers all their working lives.
They head institutions with very different customs and histories. But once
in harness, they seem to become remarkably like-minded people who are often
more in tune with each other than the politicians and officials of their
national treasuries.
Top central bankers work together closely, meeting every month in Basle.
They are in frequent telephone contact. The 'phone lines between the leading
central banks were humming furiously in February when the bloodbath on the
world bond markets seemed at one moment to threaten the world financial
system.
Although unelected and often paid more than politicians, these many men and
few women are currently going from strength to strength. Their prestige is
unscathed by the existence of 35m unemployed in the industrialised world.
The British government, when faced with the problem of restoring credibility
to economic policy after sterling's unceremonious exit from the European
exchange rate mechanism, found the answer in greater openness, and giving
greater responsibility for monetary policy to the Bank of England. Italy, at
the height of its political crisis, turned to Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, the
Italian central bank governor, to be prime minister.
The increasing complexity of financial markets, characterised by a huge
increase in cross-border capital flows and the increased use of arcane
financial instruments, has put a premium on central bankers' expertise.
The acceptance of the idea that inflation is bad for economic growth and
prosperity and that central banks are primarily responsible for combating it
has helped turn central bank governors into public figures. Mr Tietmeyer
spends much of his life lecturing his countrymen and financial markets on
the Bundesbank's determination to control inflation. Britain's Mr George has
been far more visible than his predecessor, following the government's
decision to involve the Bank more in monetary policy.
The independent Bundesbank's success in combating inflation has prompted
other countries as far afield as New Zealand, Chile, Mexico and France to
give their central banks more independence. Demands for independence or
greater autonomy for other central banks, including the Bank of England,
have grown. But, with the possible exception of the Bundesbank, more
autonomy will invariably mean greater accountability.
Today's central bankers must increasingly come to terms with a world in
which they can no longer operate out of the public eye. Mr George, while
welcoming the recent decision to publish the minutes of his monthly meetings
with the chancellor after about six weeks, observed that his new position
was 'not particularly comfortable'.
He meant that, in future, people would be able to judge whether the Bank's
advice to the government had been good or bad. He and his colleagues
currently stand on the crest of a wave of approbation. But central bank
governors are too realistic to believe this will always be the case. As
their mystique is gradually stripped away, they will doubtless have to
justify themselves and their actions far more in the face of growing
critical scrutiny.

</HEADLINE>

   From Ms EDI SMOKUM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Dunkley's argument is as flawed as the programme he purports to
criticise. He jumps from attacking feminism to justifying (which I trust he
is not really trying to do) making love to children. BBC 1's Inside Story
may be questioned on several fronts, but the testimony of the adult men in
the film should go some way towards proving that 'making love with children
really is the most damaging crime of all'. Quite evidently those interviewed
were very damaged by the adults who were sexually abusing them. And what the
programme had to do with feminism (which is separate from Dunkley's
so-called 'victim culture') is beyond this viewer and reader.
Perhaps Dunkley's column was cut? I trust the Financial Times does not
advocate such a justification of paedophilia.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Many people would no doubt agree with Christopher Dunkley's comment
that 'political correctness seems to have a frightening hold over more and
more BBC journalism' ('Danger of overkill', June 8).
What is disturbing, however, is the hold that pseudo enlightened
'intellectual' journalism has over common sense morality. Political
correctness has much to answer for, not least allowing journalists such as
Mr Dunkley to state that it is only 'fashion (that) dictates making love
with children really is the most damaging crime of all'.
Paedophiles do not 'make love' with children, they violate them physically
and emotionally to satisfy their own perverted requirements.
Better some 'sanctimonious' comment from Dunkley's tabloid colleagues than
the arguments of a moral wolf dressed in intellectual sheep's clothing.

FT  11 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Tonga the featherweight in the
central banking stakes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ADRIAN P HEWITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The Central Bank of the Solomon Islands may be a tiddler, as you report
(Observer, June 9), but last month I paid a visit both there and to Tonga's
central bank to assist with manpower development. I conclude that the
National Reserve Bank of Tonga is considerably smaller.
Whether you apply the yardstick used by Central Banking magazine staff
numbers (NRBT 21, CBSI 61) or compare gross national product (Tonga Dollars
110m, Solomon Islands Dollars 186m) or population covered (Tonga 100,000,
Solomons 320,000), the powerhouse of the Pa'Anga comes out a good deal
smaller.
However, the Central Bank of the Solomon Islands has the best display of
shell and feather currency. That's perhaps central banking at its most
basic.

FT  11 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Price stability and employment link
false
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JAMES FORDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Michael Prowse's disparaging review (Book Review, June 9) of Paul
Krugman's book, Peddling Prosperity, suggests that 'conservative economics'
is alive and well, apparently because Krugman accepts some of Milton
Friedman's once controversial claims. Friedman, of course, likewise accepts
much from Keynes, but so what?
One such claim accepted by Krugman is that there is no trade-off between
inflation and unemployment in the long run. But to deny a trade-off is not
to deny an effect: we cannot permanently lower unemployment by accepting
permanently higher inflation but we might achieve a better employment record
in the long run by taking a more measured attitude to inflation reduction.
Consider this: at the trough of recession in 1977 unemployment reached 6 per
cent (using OECD figures). There followed a small recovery, then Margaret
Thatcher's Friedman-inspired recession, then the Nigel Lawson boom, at the
peak of which unemployment was 6.8 per cent] Never before Thatcher had a
post-war recession left as many people unemployed as did Lawson's boom.
Since the Thatcher period was also one of so called 'supply-side' reforms,
how can unemployment rise from recession to boom if not because of the long
term damage done by the severity of Thatcher's recession to enterprise,
infrastructure, access to foreign markets and the skills and motivation of
the workforce?
This shows that it is not the case - as crucially claimed by Friedman, and
believed by 'conservative economists' all over the world - that if policy
focuses on price stability, the labour market will deliver high rates of
employment. With this essential claim of the monetarists demonstrated as
being false and millions of unemployed paying the price, Prowse might take
less comfort from the general acceptance of lesser monetarist claims.

FT  11 JUN 94 / Trouble bubbles on the Y-front: Europe's soap powder war may
get dirtier
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Attentive readers of Europe's popular press in the past few days will have
noticed some slightly odd full-page advertisements for well-known brands of
washing powder. There are no smiling kids and mums, no ugly stains before
and after: just sober, reassuring text. Persil Power, says the UK
advertisement, does less damage to clothes than competing powders. Omo
Power, Dutch and Austrian readers are told, carries a full money back
guarantee: if you are worried, ring this number.
For the owner of the brands, the Anglo-Dutch giant Unilever, this is the
latest stage in an increasingly hectic attempt at damage limitation. The new
brands are in fact identical, and represent a major offensive in Unilever's
age-old war against Procter &amp; Gamble of the US for dominance of the world
detergents market. According to Procter, Unilever's claims are the reverse
of the truth: the new powder, under whatever name, is unacceptably harmful
to clothes and should be withdrawn.
For the public, the debate has so far been mostly knockabout: lurid
photographs of tattered boxer shorts, and tabloid headlines about froth,
lather and dirty linen. But the issue is deadly serious, and is preoccupying
both companies at the top level.
Procter's first assault, in late March, was made by no less a figure than Mr
Edwin Artzt, Procter's chairman, who flew from Cincinnati to London to
accuse startled Unilever executives of their product's failings. Since the
dispute became public a month later, at least one of the blizzard of hostile
press releases from Procter has borne the imprint of Mr Artzt's
second-in-command, Mr John Pepper. At Unilever, the affair has been
absorbing boardroom time for many weeks, particularly that of Mr Niall
Fitzgerald, head of worldwide detergents and strongly tipped as the group's
next joint chairman.
Procter's case is technical in nature, and the argument has become tangled.
The essence, however, is simple enough. For many years, the detergents
industry has sought to improve its products by incorporating manganese,
which makes powders more powerful but tends to damage fabric. Unilever
claims to have hit on the answer in 1988. The resulting manganese-based
catalyst - dubbed the Accelerator - has been incorporated in a new
generation of concentrated powders for the European market, sold in
different countries as Persil Power, Omo Power and Via Power.
Procter has retaliated by producing apparently damning evidence - backed by
the findings of independent research institutes - that the manganese in the
Accelerator, far from being kinder to clothes, does them serious damage.
Unilever rejects the claims as meaningless. First, it says, the laboratory
tests which produced Procter's results bear no relation to real life.
Second, in the long run it is the consumer, not the laboratory technician,
who decides whether the product succeeds or fails.
What Procter has done, Unilever claims, is stand one of the industry's
time-honoured tricks on its head. If you want to prove your product superior
to a competitor, you pick the exact specifications - type of fabric, type of
dye, type of stain - which show it in the best light and the competitor in
the worst. You then commission independent tests to those specifications.
The result is another of those standard TV commercials showing that new X
washes whiter than Y.
But the reverse is obviously possible. Pick a thin cotton garment which is
heavily dyed, for instance, and wash it repeatedly. By the time the bleach
in the detergent has finished removing the dye, there will be little left of
the cotton. Unilever claims to have produced this kind of result with
Procter products, but dismisses the fact as irrelevant. Any bleach-based
detergent would do the same.
Procter may or may not have been adopting this kind of tactic. Either way,
it is generally felt to be guilty of bad form, since it is giving the whole
testing game away. At least one reputable British research institute finds
itself in the embarrassing position of having tested Persil Power for both
parties, with predictably opposite results.
Unilever's case, however, suffers from one crucial weakness. It is now
bringing out an amended version of the powder with less Accelerator in it.
The plain implication is that when confronted, Unilever has blinked first.
The company is defensive about this. It had already decided on the change,
it says, as a means of broadening the product's usage. Originally conceived
as a heavy-duty detergent, the powder has proved so successful that it is
worth re-launching in a diluted version for more delicate fabrics as well.
At the same time, this is a simple way of spiking Procter's guns.
Well, perhaps. But this brings us to the second strand of Unilever's
argument: that the verdict on the product rests with the consumer. While
undoubtedly true, the argument is double-edged. Whatever the technical
merits of Procter's case, if it succeeds in alarming consumers it will have
achieved its object.
So far, the row has largely been conducted through the business press, thus
having little impact on the mass of Unilever's customers. But it is starting
to spill over into the tabloids, thus forcing Unilever to contemplate a
full-scale campaign of rebuttal. In itself, this risks making Procter's
point. There are few worse ways of introducing a new product to the public
than to deny there is anything wrong with it.
The big question is what Unilever stands to lose if, in a worst case, the
product had to be recalled. Long-established brands such as Persil would be
damaged, but the immediate financial effect would be scarcely material to a
company of Unilever's size. Several hundred million pounds have been spent
on developing and promoting the product, but that is sunk cost spread over a
decade. Unilever's total sales of concentrated detergent powders in Europe -
all of which are being replaced by the new product - are only around Pounds
300m, which is just over 1 per cent of group turnover. Stocks sold into the
trade so far probably total around Pounds 25m.
The real risk is one of lost opportunity. It seems clear, if only from
Procter's reaction, that the Accelerator - whether flawed or not - poses a
real technological threat.
Its chief property, as emphasised by this week's advertisements in the UK,
is to wash at lower temperatures. In the world outside Europe and North
America, clothes are typically washed in cooler water, or even cold. The
developing world is the real growth market for detergents, and it is one in
which Unilever historically has the edge over Procter. An Accelerator-based
powder has just been quietly introduced into Thailand and is claimed to have
had huge initial success.
The ultimate opportunity could be an attack on the US market. Unilever's
record in US detergents is one of deep gloom enlivened by fitful success,
and its market share has of late slipped disastrously. The US market is
different from Europe's in numerous ways, and the Accelerator technology is
not immediately relevant. But one can assume - as Procter doubtless does -
that Unilever is looking for ways to change that.
All this suggests that neither side can easily back down. There may also be
a personal element. Mr Artzt of Procter, on his way to retirement, will
badly want to win. Mr Fitzgerald of Unilever, with the chairmanship dangling
before him at the young age of 48, can hardly afford to lose. The soap wars
could get nastier yet.

FT  11 JUN 94 / Hang-ups and hesitation: Asian relations are on the line
over North Korea
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The confrontation over North Korea's nuclear capabilities has sparked
diplomatic shuttling on a scale previously unknown in Asia. Behind it lies
an awareness that more than the avoidance of war - though that in itself is
a grave enough task - is at stake.
At the end of a week of intense discussion centring mainly on Beijing,
Japan's foreign minister, Mr Koji Kakizawa, today goes to Seoul and on to
Beijing. He will discuss US-led moves to impose economic sanctions on North
Korea over its refusal to allow international inspections of its nuclear
facilities.
If a second Korean war does break out, the diplomatic efforts will have been
futile. But if war is averted, the episode could mark the beginning of a new
era in which Asian countries increasingly try to deal with problems among
themselves.
Repeated efforts by the US to coax North Korea into opening its nuclear
plants to inspection have failed. It is now calling for economic sanctions
to punish Pyongyang, but many Asians doubt the effectiveness of such
measures and fear President Kim Il-sung, North Korea's dictator, could be
provoked into war. They are nervous about even more hawkish voices being
raised in the US Congress.
Pyongyang says sanctions would be considered an 'act of war', suggesting it
would attack South Korea or Japan. Amid renewed suspicions that it may be
diverting plutonium into nuclear bombs, Tokyo and Seoul, as well as Beijing,
North Korea's only ally, have been forced to assume new responsibility to
allay the region's greatest security threat.
The crisis marks an important test of the future balance of power between
highly nationalistic countries with long histories of mutual animosity and
suspicion: China, with its growing economic and military muscle; Japan, with
its habitual reticence about involvement in international security issues;
and South Korea, which lies awkwardly between them and is keenly aware of
its vulnerability - its capital, Seoul, is only 35 miles from the border
with the North. In all three countries, there is debate on how best to
approach Pyongyang.
Beijing is now making no attempt to disguise the fact that it is at the
centre of attempts to calm the Korean stand-off. It is apparent that the
highest levels of the Chinese leadership are engaged.
China had for months avoided a conspicuous public role, except to counsel
against sanctions. But this week it played host to North Korea's chief of
staff and announced that the two countries were bound 'like teeth and lips'.
Though China helped to draft a UN statement on May 31 that further measures
would be taken to achieve compliance with UN nuclear safeguard requirements,
Chinese officials have also counselled against sanctions that might provoke
confrontation. This 'constructive ambiguity' is designed to avoid moves that
might further isolate Pyongyang and risk its destabilisation.
Beijing believes dialogue and diplomacy still have some distance to run. It
is advocating a carrot and stick approach, and believes the carrot should be
appealing enough to encourage North Korea to accede to demands for access to
its nuclear sites. This would include formal recognition by the US as well
as international aid.
However, western officials who have been in detailed discussions with the
Chinese are in no doubt that, if diplomacy fails, Beijing will go along with
sanctions, either actively or by abstaining on a Security Council vote.
'The stage has been set for China to go along with sanctions, as long as the
Chinese first are convinced that efforts to resolve the issue are serious
and earnest,' said one western official.
Japan shares China's belief that negotiations and promises of economic aid
are the way to bring North Korea round. Mr Tsutomu Hata's weak minority
government will reluctantly agree to join in with sanctions, but Japan would
prefer to issue a warning first and has doubts about cutting cash transfers
from North Koreans in Japan.
The hawks like Mr Ich-iro Ozawa, the backroom strategist of the government,
argue Japan must face up to the greatest test of its ability to help solve
an international crisis since the invasion of Kuwait. Diplomats painfully
recall the derision Tokyo attracted by contributing cash but not soldiers to
the Gulf conflict.
Pragmatists, however, argue that Japan can ill afford to clash with China,
an increasingly important trade partner.
Japan can scarcely duck the question of sanctions because they would be
ineffective if it failed to take part. Japan is North Korea's second-largest
trade partner after China.
The government does not wish to offend more than 700,000 North Koreans
resident in Japan. Mr Hata is likely to refuse reported US demands for a
block on the estimated Y62bn (Pounds 395m) a year which they carry in their
pockets when they visit their homeland, though it will be able to block
direct bank transfers, estimated at a paltry Y10bn.
If Mr Kakizawa, the foreign minister, fails this weekend to overcome
Beijing's resistance to sanctions, Japan faces the uncomfortable prospect of
being asked to join the US and South Korea in sanctions without Chinese
support, outside the framework of the UN.
Mr Hata could probably summon a majority in parliament for non-UN sanctions,
but may have to pay a heavy political price to the opposition Liberal
Democratic party.
Though the South Korean government decided this week to join the US in
vehement calls for sanctions, it too faces domestic political pressures over
this policy.
The move was a victory for conservative government officials who have
criticised Seoul's weakness in confronting Pyongyang. But others both inside
and outside the government question whether sanctions will achieve much.
They believe sanctions would not have much immediate impact on the North
Korean economy, which is largely self-sufficient owing to the country's
juche (self-reliance) ideology. A trade embargo by only the US, Japan and
South Korea is seen as even less effective. China provides 75 per cent of
vital oil and food imports, and is expected to permit cross-border trade for
as long as possible because it fears North Korea's internal collapse could
cause millions to flee to China.
There is little doubt in Seoul that sanctions would force North Korea to
withdraw from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, ending any possibility
of Pyongyang accepting international nuclear inspections in the future.
The South Korean government's difficulty in joining sanctions is heightened
by public scepticism about the nuclear threat from the north, as well as
about Washington's motives. Many South Koreans, mindful of Japan's 1910-1945
colonial rule, believe Tokyo, not Pyongyang, poses the biggest potential
threat to them. Against this background, growth in Chinese influence over
the Korean peninsula may be one of the effects of the present confrontation.
That these debates are taking place within and between Asian countries is
perhaps just as important as the crisis they are addressing. They may,
provided there is no war, forge regional mechanisms for dealing with
disputes and help to establish a new order in Asia - in which the US may
have a reduced role.

FT  11 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Great deal of value for young
'volunteers'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms ANDREA KELMANSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, David Goodhart portrays the Commission for Social Justice's 'Citizens'
Service' scheme as compulsory ('Army of volunteers may be called up', June
2). Compulsory volunteering is a contradiction in terms; such a scheme would
undermine and devalue the genuinely voluntary spirit which was celebrated
last week in the course of Volunteers Week '94.
The scheme proposed by the commission, however, is far from compulsory. It
differs from other schemes in both its scale - it proposes involving 150,000
participants - and in its accessibility. Unlike existing schemes, it would
not be targeted solely at the unemployed, but would aim to harness the
energy of young people across the social divide.
The aspirations of a scheme such as this, to provide education for life for
a wide range of young people, in addition to vocational experience, are to
be welcomed. The thousands of young people who are, and who have been,
volunteers have gained a great deal of value from their experiences, as well
as benefiting the community in the process.
The extent to which such a scheme would be 'truly voluntary' is likely to
vary from project to project, and even from participant to participant.
Perceptions are all-important; someone who feels themselves to be a
volunteer, carrying out a service to the community, may well find themselves
alongside someone else attracted by the extra Pounds 10 or Pounds 20 a week.
The key is that personal development is of equal value to the task being
done, that the tasks themselves are meaningful and worthwhile, and that the
choices, opinions and feedback of participants are respected. If this is
done successfully, many of those participants on schemes will become
volunteers for life.

<TEXT>
Ambition for Labour
'Most obviously it is to lead the party into government and to end 15 years
of being a party of protest. But the reason for putting Labour into
government is so that we can begin the process of national renewal which I
believe is essential for the country to build a strong and decent society
that is capable of developing individual effort and enterprise.
I think Labour has got to be a party with a very clear sense of its own
modern identity. That is about applying its traditional values, its belief
in society, social justice, equality of opportunity and applying those
values to the modern world. And I think it has got to be a party that is
capable of building a new coalition of support in the country that reaches
out beyond its traditional boundaries of support to be a vehicle for the
national renewal that I want to see.
But the beliefs that I hold are derived from a very clear tradition of the
left-of-centre and the Labour party throughout its entire history.
Welfare state
What we want is to recreate the notion of the welfare state as a vehicle for
economic opportunity and security for people rather than welfare dependency.
We want a nation at work and not a nation on benefit.
I would like to look at the benefits that we have at the present time in the
context of what the Social Justice Commission reports . . . But I think the
main change in emphasis that I would like to see is this notion of
modernising the welfare state by getting back actually to its basic
principles. Beveridge never foresaw a situation where people would for years
on end be recipients of welfare. The purpose of it was to give people the
opportunity of making their way in their own lives.
Leadership style
If you look back over 10 years, the time that I have been on the Labour
party front-bench, I have always tried to include people and to take people
with me in the changes I have wanted to make.
I think an inclusive and open and listening style of leadership is very very
important and I think John Smith gained a lot of respect in the Labour party
for that. I think it's very important to try and work by agreement with
people and by making people understand what we are about.
Liberals and PR
I don't believe in pacts and I don't believe they work. I don't think you
can start trying to impose pacts on political parties. I don't think it
works. What I have always said is it is at the level of ideas that we should
be prepared to open up. The Social Justice Commission is the beginning of
that in a sense and what I have actually called the dialogue of ideas goes
on. I think that's important.
The party policy is to give people a referendum on proportional
representation. I personally am not persuaded by PR but the party policy I
think is the right one.
Trade unions
The basic relationship between Labour and the trade unions is built on the
bond of belief between the two. The changes that were put in train last year
by John Smith ensure that the relationship is focused much more on the
individual participation of trades union members. There will always be a
relationship between the trade union and the Labour party, there has been
historically and there will continue to be. It should be a relationship that
is based on fairness and not on favours. It is not the function of a Labour
government to come in and do particular favours for the trade union
movement. What we have said is we will set a legal framework that is fair to
trade unionists. Now in my view it should be up to somebody whether they
join a trade union or not and that is why I moved the Labour party away from
the position of the closed shop. But if people do want to join a trade union
they should be entitled to do so. Where there is substantial support for the
union at the workplace they should be entitled to have their union represent
them. But it should be a matter of the free choice of the employees
concerned.
Industrial policy
If you put to me the question, is it the function of the Labour party to
pick winners, the answer is No. Is it the function of a Labour government to
try and tell industry how to run its affairs? No. But it is the function of
any sensible modern industrial policy, for example in the field of
technology or training, to make sure that the efforts of government and
society as a whole are backing up the efforts of industry to be successful
and to grow.
I think it is important that employers train and if they don't train that
they have some social responsibility to make some contribution to the
national training effort.
Water industry
We certainty disagreed with the water industry being sold off. But I think
that most people would not regard it as a sensible expenditure of money . .
. unless you had a very great deal of money to spend . . . that you
renationalise the water industry as opposed to say spending money on health
or education.'

FT  11 JUN 94 / A marketable Danger Man: Tony Blair tells Philip Stephens
how economic efficiency and social justice could go hand in hand under
Labour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In six weeks Mr Tony Blair expects to be the next leader of the Labour
party. Barring a freak electoral accident, he will be.
Mr John Prescott will put up a good fight. Mrs Margaret Beckett is a
shrewder, more able politician than she is given credit for. Both should
receive a respectable degree of support in the cumbersome electoral college
of MPs, party activists and trades unions supporters that decides the
succession.
But in its heart the Labour party has probably made up its mind. After 15
years in the political wildnerness, it shows every sign that it has
rediscovered an appetite for power instead of protest.
Mr Blair, a 41-year-old barrister who entered parliament only in 1983, will
have fewer than three years to establish himself as a credible prime
minister-in-waiting, and to present his party as a plausible alternative
government.
He has never travelled in a ministerial car. He was 26 when Mrs Margaret
Thatcher launched her revolution. But he is as sure as any politician to be
found at Westminster of where he wants to end up: in 10 Downing Street.
He would hate the comparison but, like Mrs Thatcher before him, the MP for
the former mining constitutuency of Sedgefied, County Durham, is a dangerous
politician: dangerous because he embraces political ideas and ambition in
equal measure.
It is the perception of the soft-centred appeal of an Oxbridge-educated
former public schoolboy to Labour's lost supporters in southern England that
has propelled the media bandwagon in his favour since the death of Mr John
Smith. But it is his fluent promise to recreate Labour as a party of ideas
that alarms his embattled opponents in Mr John Major's cabinet.
Let us not run ahead of events. Before he can contemplate a general
election, Mr Blair must win the leadership. The result may be predictable
(as far as anything can be certain even in the modern Labour party) but the
battle will be important. It will be the most important test he has faced of
the depth and resilience of his commitment to a different kind of socialism.
It should tell us whether he has the capacity to translate his ideology into
a message that the electorate can understand, whether he can give policy
substance to his media soundbites. By the end of July, we should also have a
clear idea of whether his party is ready to see social democracy supplant
socialism.
Sitting in his comfortable but ramshackle constituency home in the village
of Trimdon, Mr Blair is enthusiastic about the project. He is nervous (who
wouldn't be?). But he leaves the impression of a politician who is far more
excited about the potential opportunities than daunted by them.
In an interview lasting more than 75 minutes and ranging across a dozen
issues, there emerge two or three central themes: Labour must embrace the
future; it must stop confusing its basic, still essential, values with
outdated means of implementing them; it must take the political fight
against the Conservatives on to ground of its, not their, choosing.
The words and phrases which recur most often are: individual, opportunity,
education, values, dynamic market economy, social cohesion. Somehow he
manages to knit them together without the seams showing.
But there are flashes of acknowledgment, too, that Mr Blair's party is not
yet quite as modern as he might like it to be - and that he needs the votes
of traditionalists as well as fellow modernisers.
So full employment, the standard raised by Mr Prescott yesterday at the
start of his campaign, is not a commitment to be jettisoned. Nor is the
pledge, cherished by Mr Smith, of a minimum wage. Instead, they will be
implemented flexibly and with 'common sense', another of Mr Blair's
favourite phrases.
The interview starts with Labour's project for the country: 'First of all we
need to develop the notion of a dynamic modern economy which is delivering
opportunity to all its people and not merely to a limited number.
'It's got to have at its core, notions of social cohesion and social
justice, a modern constitution for the country and a modern organisation for
the party, which is capable of sustaining it not merely in opposition but in
government.
'Its overarching theme, through what I call this process of national
renewal, is the idea of economic efficiency and social justice, hand in
hand.'
Mr Blair warms to the theme:
'We must escape from the idea that has marked the Tory years whereby people
believe you have to choose between an efficient economy and notions of
social cohesion or social justice.
'In my view the central message of the modern Labour party is to reunite
notions of individual aspiration with notions of a strong cohesive society
so that the process of social improvement leads to self-improvement.'
There you have it. At the heart of Mr Blair's philosophy is the notion that
the individual prospers only in a strong society. Labour is the friend, not
the enemy, of self-advancement.
But doesn't that mean a wholesale rejection of Labour's past, the creation
of a new social democrat party? Didn't some others in the Labour party try
that with the SDP in the early 1980s? Mr Blair anticipates the question.
'The Labour party got into problems when, like many left-of-centre parties,
it failed to distinguish between its values and principles - which I believe
stem from an essential belief in the role of society and its relationship to
the individual - when it started to confuse those principles and values with
particular means of implementation, which might be relevant for a particular
time but which then have to change from generation to generation.'
It is a cumbersome answer. But the message is clear. The party's policies
should reflect the modern application of traditional values. It should build
on, not relive, its past. His solidly Labour constituents in Sedgefield have
no quarrel with the idea that the party should want to give them a leg-up in
society. Why should anyone else?
And no, this does not make Mr Blair a left-leaning Tory: 'It is not merely a
question of saying, if you like, you run a Tory economy, but there is a bit
of compassion added in.
'The basic principle that distinguishes the Labour party from the
Conservatives is that we are prepared both economically and socially to use
the power of society in order to advance the individual. Call it social
solidarity, call it what you will, but that basic principle is what
differentiates the parties.'
It all sounds plausible stuff. But where, as an inelegant American once put
it, is the beef? What sort of economy would a Labour government led by Mr
Blair run? Does he believe in markets? He does.
'We want a dynamic market economy. It is not merely that I, as it were, with
hesitation, acknowledge that this is the way we have to go. I say that it is
positively in the public interest to have a dynamic market economy.'
Of itself, though, this is not enough: 'Where I differ from the Tories is in
believing that merely by having a market economy you thereby encapsulate the
entirety of the public interest in economic policy.'
The market, it seems, is to be treated as a means rather than an end: 'There
will be things the market simply cannot do and limitations to what it can
achieve. But perhaps more importantly, in order to make that market economy
operate efficiently in a modern world there will be social and public
objectives that society as a whole will have to achieve.'
He is cautious about what can be achieved through macro-economic policy.
Holding down inflation matters: 'The purpose of any macro-economic policy
should be sustainable growth and rising employment. It has to be sustainable
over a period of time. It is in the interests of nobody that you have short
periods of boom followed by long periods of bust . . . which is actually the
hallmark of macro-economic policy over the last 15 years.'
Labour's commitment to 'lifetime' education and training marks a recognition
that crude demand management no longer holds the answers in a open,
international, economy. The supply side counts. If it did not, people would
not be talking about the economy bumping up against constraints while there
were still nearly 3m people out of work.
'There is no long-term future for this country on an other basis than by
having a highly educated, adaptable and flexible workforce. That will come
primarily through education and skills. I don't think there is any greater
priority than developing those areas.'
It is here that Mr Blair gives a sense that he has carefully rehearsed his
core message: he sees in his economic and social prospectus the chance for
Labour to define a new political battleground.
The script runs as follows:
'What I think we have to do in economic policy is set out in effect - this
is the scale of the task - we have to set out a new economic agenda for what
will be very shortly a new millenium.'
That means: 'Moving beyond arguments about public versus private sector,
market versus state, even regulation versus deregulation. These are
arguments, where obviously there are difficult questions to be resolved, but
they are not going to hold the key to whether Britain succeeds or not as an
economy.'
Instead: 'The key to whether Britain succeeds in my view lies first of all
in developing individual potential through education and skills. It is
absolutely central, because if we do not do that through enhancing
opportunities at the workplace and by making sure those who are unemployed
get the chance to work, we will be unable to modernise our economy.'
Now Mr Blair is setting out his stall: 'Secondly, we need to develop at the
workplace the notion of a modern industrial partnership so that employees
and managers are working together, not set in some irredeemable conflict
against one another.'
The third item on this checklist is an industrial policy, but not an
outdated one: 'The role of government is not about picking winners or
whatever. It is about government enabling industry to make the best use of
things like technology and research and development.'
Partnership would also replace interventionism in the implementation of his
fourth priority: the rebuilding of Britain's infrastructure. Building new
rail links, and regenerating Britain's inner cities would be done in
public-private sector parnership.
Mr Blair has not finished. Fifthly, a Labour government would not ignore the
social dimension to economic advancement, whether through education and
training or through reform of the welfare state.
He will not commit himself on specific measures in advance of the report of
the party's Social Justice Commission, but he knows the direction in which
the party should be going: 'That means, if you like, modernising the welfare
state so that it becomes about economic opportunity for people, not simply
about welfare dependency.'
After 10 minutes Mr Blair is coming to the end of the list, and on this
final point one suspects his words are directed as much at the expansive
economic ambitions of some traditionalists in his own party as to a wider
audience.
The sixth plank in the new economic agenda is a 'recognition that
macro-economic policy has got to be governed by principles of international
co-operation. It is not possible in today's world to isolate ourselves from
other economies and run macro-economic policy in a vacuum.' Labour must own
up to reality, he might have said.
Mr Blair sums up: 'These are the items which in my view will form a new
economic agenda. Those are the things that governments should be
concentrating on. These other issues - you know, a battle for territory
between public versus private sector . . . that's just the politics of
decades ago. And the public has long since moved beyond that.'
It is time to take him on to slightly rougher ground. How do a blanket
commitment to full employment and to a minimum wage fit in with this new
modernism vision? Surely they are symbols of a collectivist past?
Just this week the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development
warned Europe of the need to de- not re-regulate its employment markets to
provide the job opportunities he talks about. Mr Blair, predictably enough,
is prepared for the questions.
Some, on the modernising wing of the Labour party, would like the pledges to
be put quietly to one side, if not dropped. But Mr Blair's contention is
that they are, anyway, more flexible than outsiders have appreciated.
When Mr Smith offered the full employment commitment at last year's Trades
Union Congress, he drew an implicit link with the undertaking given by the
then Conservative government in its 1944 White Paper.
That document, Mr Blair reminds us, said: 'It should be one of the primary
responsibilities of government to promote high and stable levels of
employment - that is the definition of the goal of full employment.' He is
entirely comfortable with that as a goal - what politician would not be?
But there would be no commitment to put x million people back into work
during a specific timescale: 'It's not a numbers game.' And then: 'I don't
think anyone would suggest that this is something you can achieve overnight
or that you won't still have frictional levels of unemployment. But the
important thing is to make a start and do so with a commitment that it is a
responsibility of government to ensure the conditions in which people get
the chance to work.'
Mr Blair chooses his words just as carefully when pressed on the minimum
wage. The argument about regulation of labour markets has been polarised.
His is the common sense approach.
'It is important that we have a balance between sensible regulation to
provide a minimum set of fair standards at the workplace and legislation
that does not load costs unreasonably on employers. The notion we have a
choice either of inflexible social legislation or an entirely deregulated
labour market is absolutely absurd.'
Nor would Labour slavishly accept everything suggested by its European
partners: 'You take the social chapter. What I always used to say about the
social chapter is that it was right we should have binding principles and
flexible means . . . that we should ensure that it is implemented in a way
that is sensible and flexible.'
As for the minimum wage: 'It is important to argue for the principle of a
basic minimum level below which no one falls. Provided that it is done
sensibly and administered in a sensible way, then what it does is to remove
the most exploitative forms of low pay.'
He will not put a figure on the level of any minimum wage. It would, anyway,
have to operate flexibly. Young people on training programmes, for example,
would not be covered. But 'it is foolish and old-fashioned to believe that
if you have a level of fair treatment at the workplace, you are going to
create a less efficent economy'.
Mr Blair knows how to play off a sticky wicket. He does it again on tax and
spending. No, he will not provide the FT, even before he has become party
leader, with a list of specific pledges to be offered at the next election.
But he will say that Labour would not be in the business of spending and
taxing for the sake of it. And he will remind our readers of the
Conservatives' record in order to refocus the debate where it properly
should be - on the link between economic performance, taxation and spending.
'I think the two most significant statistics of the Tory years are that
after 15 years of a government committed ostensibly to low taxation and
cutting public spending we have tax and spending as a higher proportion of
our national income than under the last Labour government.'
In other words: 'We are running a high tax economy because we are running a
low success economy.' So would Labour cut the burden? Well, Labour was
committed to running a successful economy: 'The critical reason why we have
failed is that we have not had the capacity or the skills to develop a
modern economy that is capable of creating the wealth so that we can get tax
rates down and yet have a level of social spending that is acceptable.'
For good measure Mr Blair adds that Labour opposed the last round of tax
increases: 'The critical task is to improve the performance of the economy
so that the burden of taxation is reduced.'
No hostages to fortune there. And that is another reason why Mr Blair is a
dangerous politician. Along with the ideas and the ambition, there is
discipline and self-control. The Conservatives may think they have worries
enough without thinking about the next leader of the Labour party. They
would be wrong.

FT  11 JUN 94 / Leading Article: Voteless recovery
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Scare stories of a 'jobless recovery' in the US were just that, merely a
scare. US secretary of labour, Robert Reich, visiting the UK this week, even
boasted that 'in the 16 months the Clinton administration has been in
Washington, the American economy has added more than 3m new jobs in private
industry'. Such have been the benefits of winning an election at an ideal
point in the economic cycle. But this does not necessarily bring political
rewards, as the British prime minister must now know. He gained re-election
precisely when the British recession hit bottom. But for the Conservatives,
this has been a voteless recovery.
Just how voteless was demonstrated by the by-elections on Thursday. In
Eastleigh, for example, a Conservative majority of 17,702 over the Liberal
Democrats at the 1992 general election was turned into a Liberal Democrat
majority of 9,239 over Labour, with the Conservatives in third place. The
European parliamentary election results, due late tomorrow night, may reveal
a massacre. Mr Major must count himself fortunate that the Labour party is
just starting a leadership campaign of its own.
A question that must plague the government is whether the recovery will ever
give it the political benefits it longs for. It has not done so yet, even
though it is well-established. The turn-around in the level of gross
domestic product occurred between the first and second quarters of 1992,
with GDP growth amounting to 1.4 per cent in the year to the first quarter
of 1993, followed by another 2.6 per cent in the year to the first quarter
of 1994.
The most important economic data out this week, those for industrial output
in April, confirm this picture of an increasingly strong recovery,
notwithstanding the tax increases that came into effect subsequent to last
November's budget and in April. Total seasonally adjusted output in the
three months to April was up 1 per cent on the previous three months, with
manufactured output up 1.2 per cent.
Hedged endorsement
This week, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development added
its mite, by providing a carefully hedged endorsement of central planks of
Conservative policy towards the labour market, and by raising its forecasts
for economic growth. The secretariat now expects the economies of OECD
member countries to grow by 2.6 per cent this year (up half a percentage
point on last December's forecast), followed by 2.9 per cent next year.
Buoyancy in its principal trading partners is important for the next leg of
the UK recovery, particularly since yesterday's trade figures confirmed the
disappointingly modest growth in UK exports, notwithstanding sterling's
devaluation after its ejection from the ERM. With Germany forecast by the
OECD to achieve 1.8 per cent growth this year and 2.6 per cent next, the
British export cause should certainly receive a boost.
The OECD's forecast for UK economic growth itself remains around 2.9 per
cent this year and next, which looks plausible. But the problem even with
2.9 per cent economic growth is that it means modest increases in real
disposable incomes after tax, because of the substantial phased tax
increases announced by Mr Norman Lamont and Mr Kenneth Clarke. It also means
the economy would merely be bumping along the bottom of its longer-term
growth trend.
Especially dissatisfied
A simple way to derive that trend is to take annual rates of growth between
successive cyclical peaks and troughs, defined by whether quarterly growth
is turning decisively below trend (in the case of peaks) or above it (in the
case of troughs). The trend growth rate over the last cycle turns out to be
2 1/4 per cent a year - and 2.9 per cent is only modestly better than that.
If voters believe economic growth at the trend rate is their right, as seems
plausible, they are unlikely to find anything special about this
performance.
They will be especially dissatisfied after a fierce recession. If output had
continued to rise on trend from its peak at the end of 1988, it would be 10
per cent higher than it is now. Continuation of economic growth at 2.9 per
cent would not bring the economy back to even half-way between its
peak-to-peak and trough-to-trough trend lines before the end of the
millennium. Yet bringing the economy back to the mid-point still faster
would be risky, since inflationary pressure is not just related to the
amount of slack in an economy, but also to the speed with which it is
eliminated.
The government hopes that economic recovery will somehow offset the many
other reasons for its unpopularity. Yet on present trends, growth may not be
fast enough to make that much of a political difference. At the same time,
forcing the economy to grow still faster than 3 per cent a year, however
tempting, would be irresponsible. The good news for the government is that
the recovery is indeed continuing. The bad news is that it could remain
voteless.

FT  11 JUN 94 / Rail regime tested in payout row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A stretch of waterlogged signal cable near Edinburgh is set to pose the
first serious test of the decentralised railway system which is being
created from British Rail.
Intercity East Coast, which runs trains between London and Scotland, is
seeking compensation from Railtrack, which has taken over BR's signalling,
track and stations, for the signalling failure.
This is the first time, since Railtrack was created on April 1, that a
significant disagreement has arisen between it and a train-operating
company.
The east-coast company has been forced to terminate its London-to-Glasgow
service in Edinburgh because of the failure of a 20-year old stretch of
signal cable just outside the Scottish capital.
Water has penetrated a section of cable and work on replacing it is expected
to take at least another 10 weeks, the east-coast company said. Customers
from London who would normally take the east-coast route have been switching
to the slower west-coast line.
'We face the prospect of losing our core Glasgow service during the summer
peak,' the east-coast company said. It was speaking to Railtrack to seek
compensation, it added.
Railtrack said passengers would face diversions. The company said it was
talking to Intercity East Coast about the amount of 'rebate' it should pay
but said it was not required to pay compensation.
If the Edinburgh-Glasgow section remains closed through the summer the
east-coast line faces a loss of more than Pounds 1m in revenue.
The train operators have complained that the track-access agreements are
drawn up in Railtrack's favour and impose insufficient penalties for any
failures of track or signalling.
Some operators, which are engaged in preparing for privatisation, have said
that the impact on their finances of a lengthy line closure could be
disastrous. Under British Rail, losses could be absorbed by the organisation
as a whole.
Critics of privatisation have argued that the new system would lead to legal
battles between the different companies in the railway system. Mr Roger
Salmon, the railway franchising director, says he has devised a framework of
contracts designed to avoid litigation.
Railtrack has reached an agreement with Boots the chemists to treble the
size of its shop at London's Liverpool Street station. Boots will spend
Pounds 1m to extend the store in return for a 21-year lease.

FT  11 JUN 94 / Devastated Tories fear an even heavier blow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Conservatives were devastated yesterday by the party's by-election
defeats, and fearful of an even heavier blow when the European election
results are declared tomorrow night.
Cabinet ministers tried to put a brave face on the party's third-place
results in Eastleigh, Bradford South and Barking, and its second-place
performance in Dagenham and Newham North East.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said he was 'extremely
optimistic' that the Conservatives would recover from the 'short-term blip'
in the party's electoral fortunes to win the next general election.
Conservatives MPs drew comfort from the low turnout in all five polls, which
was interpreted as a sign that core supporters had abstained rather than
switching support to opposition parties.
Mr David Willetts, Conservative MP for Havant, said: 'We have to win back
our supporters, but winning them back from abstention is an easier task than
winning them back from voting for another party.'
But few Tories expect anything other than a crushing defeat in the European
elections. At worst, experts say they could be left without a single seat in
the parliament.
Mr David Butler, the psephologist, said the safest Conservative seat -
Buckinghamshire and East Oxfordshire - would fall to the Liberal Democrats
by a 7 per cent margin if the Eastleigh result were repeated in the 84
British mainland seats.
Such a result would give the Liberal Democrats between 12 and 14 seats,
compared with none in the last parliament; Labour 68 to 70 seats, compared
with 45; and the Scottish National party two seats, up from one. In a
general election, the 21 per cent swing at Eastleigh would reduce the
Conservatives to a handful of seats.
Labour and Liberal Democrat MPs were buoyed by the by-election results, but
strategists disagreed sharply about which party was the principal challenger
to the Tories in the south of England. Mr Jack Straw, Labour's campaign
manager, said its second-place position in Eastleigh showed that confidence
in the Tory party had collapsed.
'By forcing the Conservatives into third place, and achieving a significant
improvement in our share of the vote, it was Labour in Eastleigh that
inflicted the truly devastating blow to John Major and his government,' he
said.
'There has not been a result like Eastleigh, where the Tories have gone from
a strong first to a poor third place, in modern British politics.'
However, the Liberal Democrats pointed to a fall of about 500 votes in
Labour's total vote since the 1992 general election as evidence that Labour
had failed to win over Conservative supporters.
Mr Matthew Taylor, Liberal Democrat campaign organiser, said Labour's vote
had fallen 'despite the biggest effort by Labour in a by-election for many
years'. He added: 'Where the Labour party tries to attract new voters, they
fail and we succeed.
'The hardest elections of all for Liberal Democrats to win are the European
elections. We have not done it before. We believe we now have. We are in a
buoyant mood,' he said.
'If the government does not learn the lessons of these elections, they are
going to face further humiliations, culminating in their defeat at the
general election.'
In the Liberal Democrats' first official forecast of the European campaign,
Mr Charles Kennedy, president, said the party was certain to win its first
seats: 'We should win two or three for sure.'
William Hill, the bookmaker, shortened its odds on a Labour victory at the
next general election from 4-6 to 4-7, with the Tories lengthening from
11-10 to 5-4 and the Liberal Democrats at 25-1.

FT  11 JUN 94 / Heartlands turn to 'wastelands': How the political parties
interpreted the Eastleigh by-election result
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is a measure of the government's unpopularity that the losing
Conservative candidate in a by-election can claim a 20 per cent swing to the
Liberal Democrats as an encouraging result.
Mr Stephen Reid, Tory candidate in the Eastleigh by-election, who saw a
17,702 Tory majority turned into a Liberal Democrat one of more than 9,000,
yesterday said the result proved that the third party's bandwagon had come
to a halt.
In the Newbury and Christchurch by-elections there were swings to the
Liberal Democrats of 28 per cent and 35 per cent respectively. Commenting on
the Eastleigh by-election, Mr Reid said: 'This is obviously not a good
result for the Liberal Democrats.'
He said he was delighted that he had won more than 13,000 votes. Yet it was
the first time his party had been pushed into third place in a by-election
in a seat which it had previously held since it lost Brecon and Radnor in
1985.
While Labour had more to be pleased with by coming second in a seat which it
knew it had no chance of winning, it decided to compete with the Tories on
the hyperbole stakes. 'This is a remarkable result for Labour,' said its
candidate Mrs Marilyn Birks, ignoring the fact that her party polled about
500 votes less than in the 1992 general elect-ion.
She had avoided the ignominy of a lost deposit in a southern seat - which
she indicated yesterday she had feared from the beginning of the campaign.
'Our great success was that we avoided a collapse in the Labour vote,' she
said.
Mr John Denham, Labour MP for the neighbouring Southampton-Itchen
constituency, declared for Mr Tony Blair in Labour's leadership election
because he said the shadow home secretary could make the difference in
Labour coming second or first in scores of southern Tory-held seats. But Mrs
Birks did not share his analysis and said she had yet to make up her mind on
who to vote for.
It was left to the Eastleigh victor, Liberal Democrat Mr David Chidgey, to
make the only plausible claim of the three main parties. He said the result
demonstrated that the Liberal Democrats were still best placed to win Tory
seats in the south of England.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, leader of the Liberal Democrats, could not resist the
temptation to make grander claims by declaring that the Tory heartlands had
become 'Tory wastelands'.
He added: 'To the Tories it was a night of humiliation and catastrophe.'
It may have looked that way to most people, but at the Eastleigh Tory
headquarters party workers were relieved that they had managed to get their
vote into double figures. 'It is important not to be over-ambitious in a
by-election,' said one Tory worker without a hint of irony.

FT  11 JUN 94 / Marchioness group wins inquest battle
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Families of the 51 people who died in the 1989 Marchioness riverboat
disaster on the Thames yesterday won the right to seek to have the inquests
into the deaths reopened before a new coroner.
The Court of Appeal said that Dr Paul Knapman, the coroner who conducted the
original inquests, had shown 'apparent bias' in describing Mrs Margaret
Lockwood-Croft, the mother of one of the victims, to a newspaper as
'unhinged'.
Lord Justice Simon Brown said it was possible that Dr Knapman thought the
families were troublemakers and unfairly undervalued their argument for
resumed inquests. Lawyers for Dr Knapman said they were considering asking
the House of Lords for leave to appeal against the ruling.

FT  11 JUN 94 / Leyland Trucks turnover at Pounds 148m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Leyland Trucks, which was rescued last year by a management buy-out,
achieved a turnover of Pounds 148m in its first 11 months of trading, the
company said yesterday, Kevin Done writes.
The company produced 6,800 trucks in the 11 months to the end of April and
plans to raise output to 8,000 vehicles in this financial year.
Leyland Trucks, which emerged from the collapse of the former Daf group last
summer, has increased production by about 20 per cent since it was formed.
Mr John Gilchrist, chief executive, who led the buy-out team, said the
present output level was 190 vehicles a week.
The workforce had been increased by 40 to 670, he said, compared with a
total of 1,100 employed at the assembly plant at Leyland, Lancashire, before
the Daf group went into receivership last year.
The break-even level for production had been reduced to about 5,500 trucks a
year. The company had cut its annual costs by about Pounds 10m since 1992
and was seeking to reduce costs by a further Pounds 2m a year.
Leyland Trucks has established three main business areas: the production of
its 45-series light trucks for sale through the European dealer network of
Daf Trucks, the Dutch company formed after the collapse of the Daf group;
the production of military trucks; and the production and sale of trucks
outside Europe.
Mr Gilchrist said the company expected to sell 7,000 trucks through the Daf
network this year, and forecast that this total would rise sharply next year
and in 1996.
For sales outside Europe, Leyland Trucks has formed links with two new
independent companies: Leyland Exports, which handles sales to sub-Saharan
countries; and Leyland Asia-Pacific, part of the Thai-Rung group based in
Thailand.
In its first year of operations Leyland Trucks has won export orders worth
Pounds 7m from 20 different countries. The company announced yesterday a new
contract to supply 180 45-series light trucks and Comet buses to Morocco in
an order worth Pounds 4m.
The group is seeking new military truck business. Last March it completed
its Pounds 155m contract to supply 1,522 ammunition carriers to the Ministry
of Defence.

FT  11 JUN 94 / Honda to spend extra Pounds 330m at Swindon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Honda is to invest a further Pounds 330m in its car production facilities at
Swindon, Wiltshire, to raise capacity by 50 per cent to 150,000 cars a year
by 1998. It will also consider a second expansion programme for the plant at
the end of the decade.
This increase in production will almost double the value of Honda's
components purchases in Europe to nearly Pounds 1bn a year.
It will also create another 500 jobs at the plant in addition to substantial
extra employment projected for the company's 211 UK and Continental
suppliers.
The plant currently employs 1,400 people, a figure due to rise to 2,000 next
year when production is scheduled to reach 100,000 units. This compares with
32,139 in 1993 and 50,000 scheduled for this year.
Mr Kazue Ito, who is to take over as president of Honda Motor Europe at the
end of this month, said yesterday that the value of components purchases
would increase by proportionately more than car-unit production. This was
mainly because Honda intended to increase 'local' - UK and continental
European - content from the current 80 per cent to between 85 per cent and
90 per cent.
Cars to be produced at Swindon - notably a successor to the Honda Concerto -
will also be more sophisticated and require a higher absolute level of
components.
Mr Nobuhiko Kawamoto, Honda president, who yesterday announced the increased
capacity plans, left the door open to further collaboration with other
manufacturers in Europe, including both Rover and Rover's parent, BMW.
The Swindon plant is also to start exports to the Middle East and Africa as
part of an overall restructuring of Honda's European operations in the wake
of BMW's takeover of Rover. These exports could reach 10,000 a year by 1999,
Mr Ito said. Honda sells 50,000 cars a year in the two regions, almost
wholly imported from Japan - many in kit form. Other countries may take
Swindon exports, he indicated.
Honda also said yesterday that it has set a total annual target for European
car sales of at least 300,000 by the year 2000 - a 2 per cent market share
compared with the market share of 1.4 per cent Honda presently has. Half of
these vehicles would be supplied from Swindon.
Meeting all these demands would exceed even the expanded Swindon capacity,
Mr Ito acknowledged.
The investment programme includes Pounds 30m for a steel body-parts
pressings plant at the Swindon site, which will end Honda's dependence on
Rover for body pressings for both the Swindon-built Honda Accord and a new
medium-size car, code-named HH, which is to enter production at Swindon this
autumn.
This car - to be called the Civic like Honda's existing medium-size range -
will be produced at a rate of up to 100,000 units a year when it goes on
sale next spring. Rover's version of the HH, code-named Theta and replacing
the current 200/400 series, also goes on sale next spring under continuing
collaboration agreements between the two companies signed last month.

FT  11 JUN 94 / Walker's signature 'forged' in transaction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The signature of Mr George Walker, the former Brent Walker chairman and
chief executive, was forged when Pounds 11m of the company's money was
laundered through an Isle of Man bank, an Old Bailey jury heard yesterday.
Mr William Cowie, a former managing director of the Royal Trust Bank, was
being questioned over two transactions the prosecution claims were at the
centre of the alleged conspiracy to inflate the profits of the Brent Walker
group.
Mr Walker and Mr Wildred Aquilina, a former finance director of the Brent
Walker group, are both accused of conspiring to falsify the company's
accounts, theft and false accounting. Both men deny the charges.
In one transaction handled by the bank in 1987, Pounds 7m went from Brent
Walker through three intermediary companies and back to Brent Walker.
In the second transaction, in January 1988, a further Pounds 4m was
transferred from a Tunisian bank to one of the intermediary companies and
then on to Brent Walker.
The prosecution alleges these transactions were part of an attempt to
pretend that Brent Walker's film division had earned Pounds 19m by selling
film rights to the three intermediary companies when the money used for the
bogus purchases in fact came from the parent company.
Cross-examined by Mr Colin Nicholls QC, for Mr Walker, Mr Cowie agreed that
the trans-actions amounted to money-laundering.
However, he had accepted assurances from Mr Donald Anderson, a former
director of the film division, that they were genuine transactions. He had
been dealing with a public company and well-established customers, he said.
The people he had dealt with over the transactions were Mr Anderson and Mr
John Quested, another former director of the film division. The prosecution
alleges both were party to the conspiracy with Mr Walker and Mr Aquilina.
Mr Cowie agreed that the signature of Mr Walker on a document authorising
part of the money-laundering now appeared to be a forgery, but he had not
appreciated this at the time.
The trial continues.

FT  11 JUN 94 / Hualon sweeps doubts aside at site ceremony
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BELFAST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
If any doubts persist about the Hualon Corporation of Taiwan or the bold
assault it plans to mount from Northern Ireland on European textile markets,
they were brushed aside yesterday as dignitaries stood in a wet field
outside Belfast to celebrate the culmination of four years of negotiation.
The field, at Corr's Corner, is the site on which Hualon will start almost
immediately to build a Pounds 160m textile manufacturing complex intended to
spearhead a drive into the European market for synthetic fibres.
Two years from now more than 500 employees should be arriving daily for
work. By the year 2003 the plant should be keeping 1,800 people busy
producing 2,000 miles of polycotton and nylon polyster daily.
The promise of such a huge bonus to Ulster's economy and to its claim to be
winning the European battle for inward investment has not surprisingly been
greeted with enthusiasm by the province's authorities and local politicians.
Suggestions in recent weeks, however, that Hualon's strategy may be
ill-founded or at least over-optimistic, combined with allegations against
two of the company's executives, have threatened to knock the cream off the
cake.
But yesterday, in spite of the cold rain of an Ulster June, the mood was
upbeat, if slightly defensive, as guests gathered to watch a ground-breaking
ceremony and to hear Mr Andrew Oung, Hualon vice-chairman, say his company
wanted to become a reputable, respected corporate citizen of Northern
Ireland.
He added: 'We are here, we are glad to be here and we are here to stay.'
Critics from the textile sector have said that Hualon's projections do not
square either with the present parlous state of European textile markets or
with its longer-term prospects. They challenge its ability to undercut Asian
producers, and say Belfast will be a low-technology operation which, even
so, is unlikely to generate the large number of jobs forecast.
The mere hint of alleged impropriety, although publicly known about for four
years, has renewed concern about the procedures employed to evaluate schemes
lining up for government cash aid.
But Hualon has secured its deal - involving Pounds 61m of public money  -
and yesterday defended itself. Mr Oung, who acknowledged that his company at
present sells only 'a few million pounds worth' of its Pounds 500m annual
sales into Europe, said Hualon was the biggest producer of polyester
filament in the world and its Belfast plant would use only state-of-the-art
machinery capable of efficient, high-volume production.
Large numbers of workers would be required to handle continuous production
programmes.
Mr Oung said overcapacity in Europe was not directly relevant to its own
target markets. The company would concentrate on a sub-sector of the textile
market demanding high volume, basic fabrics which had been abandoned by
European producers that had gone up-market in the face of import penetration
by Far East competition. He was confident that demand for basic fabric
products would remain strong.
He said the Belfast plant would be able to match production costs in Taiwan.
Labour costs would be about 15 per cent higher in Ulster but these would be
offset by other costs, such as those for land and power. He added: 'We are
relocating so to speak, so that we can offer a better and more direct
service.'

FT  11 JUN 94 / Accountants criticise draft audit regulations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Leading accountants yesterday strongly criticised regulations published by
the government as part of its pledge to reduce the audit requirements for
smaller limited companies.
The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales attacked the
government for failing to adequately consult before issuing draft guidelines
which it said had resulted in 'bizarre transitional arrangements'.
Its Financial Reporting and Accounting Group said the regulations were
silent on the appointment, removal or resignation of the 'reporting
accountant' who would take the place of the auditor.
It said the definitions of which companies were entitled to exemptions and
the method of calculating the proportion of minority shareholders required
to demand an audit were unclear.
The Department of Trade and Industry issued draft regulations on the small
company audit last month after an announcement by Mr Kenneth Clark, the
chancellor, on details of the relaxation in his November Budget speech.
Touche Ross, the accountancy firm, has also written to the DTI saying the
regulations would require the reporting accountant to perform detailed work
which would all but nullify any attempts at lessening the regulatory burden.
It said forming an opinion on whether the accounts had been drawn up in a
manner consistent with company law would require a significant amount of
work.
It added that the timing of the regulation seemed unduly rushed and would
trigger confusion among company directors while encouraging some delays in
the filing of accounts in order to take advantage of the new rules.
Other smaller practitioners have complained that guidelines on the
regulations are being prepared by the Auditing Practices Board, which they
see as having little understanding of smaller companies and firms.

FT  11 JUN 94 / Increase in trade gap alarms City
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's trade gap with the rest of the world widened in March as the UK
economic recovery pulled in imports faster than it boosted exports.
But measured over a quarterly basis, Britain's trade position improved
slightly with the underlying trend pointing to a slow rise in exports,
largely as a result of the economic improvement in continental Europe.
The UK's deficit with the rest of the world was a seasonally adjusted Pounds
1.2bn in March, the Central Statistical Office said yesterday.
This was sharply higher than February's deficit of Pounds 880m, and the
figures provoked some disappointment in the City, which had expected a
deficit of about Pounds 950m.
Although monthly figures are notoriously volatile, analysts warned that if
the trade gap continued to grow in the coming months it would revive fears
that the UK economic recovery might fuel a balance of payments problem, if
UK manufacturers were unable to cope with rising demand.
The Treasury yesterday played down these concerns and stressed that the
quarterly trend showed exports were improving.
Calculated over a three-month period, the UK trade deficit fell during the
first quarter of this year to Pounds 3.1bn, down from Pounds 3.6bn in the
last quarter of 1993. This occurred even though the CSO yesterday announced
upward revisions to February and January's trade deficit of some Pounds
300m.
Meanwhile, export volumes in the first quarter of this year rose to record
levels, running 4 per cent higher than during the final quarter of 1993.
This growth was being helped, the Treasury pointed out, by improved economic
conditions in Europe. UK exports to the rest of the European Union rose by
5.5 per cent in the first quarter of this year compared with the previous
quarter, while imports fell 0.5 per cent.
The Treasury said: 'This is consistent with recent surveys from the
Confederation of British Industry, which say that export orders are
improving - this is probably reflecting an improvement in demand in Europe.'
The UK almost halved its trade deficit with France during the first quarter
of this year to Pounds 398m, and ran a Pounds 154m surplus with the Benelux
countries. However, the trade deficit with Germany widened to Pounds 1.1bn,
its highest level since the third quarter of 1990.
Elsewhere, the recent rise in world commodity prices pushed raw material
import prices 10 per cent higher during the first quarter of the year - the
fastest quarterly growth since 1976.
Although this rise has added to inflationary concerns in some City quarters,
analysts yesterday said the rise was unlikely to feed through to factory
prices rapidly.
Mr Paul Turnbull, chief economist with broker Smith New Court, said:
'Raw-material costs are only a small part of manufacturers' total costs. It
is much more important to look at wage costs.'

FT  11 JUN 94 / Little Rutland hails big step to independence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rutland yesterday moved within reach of reasserting its right to a place in
the schoolchild's catalogue of superfluous facts as the smallest county in
the UK.
Citizens celebrated the impending triumph of history over administrative
convenience: their successful rebellion against Leicestershire. Symbols of
independence such as road signs were never pulled down anyway - the
traveller could never not know of Rutland.
One celebration cup was Rutland's Return. Mr Andrew Reid, publican at the
Old Plough in Braunston, spent most of the afternoon making the drink. For
six shillings old money or 30p in new money - for one day only at 1974
prices - he offered a mixture of orange juice, lemonade, a melon liqueur
called Midori and cucumber.
'A light summer drink,' Mr Reid said.
Ruddles Brewery said it was preparing a marketing drive for its bitter. It
could bring out a celebration ale next year, if independence is consummated.
Politicians smiled over the success of a campaign to emphasise the
separateness of the people who live on a plateau which looks down on
Leicestershire and Lincolnshire and feels part of neither. Only 10 per cent
of Rutlanders work in Leicestershire. They had no doubt of the response when
the Local Government Commission asked Rutlanders whether, after 20 years
with Leicestershire, they might like to be on their own.
The county has the same boundaries as in the 11th century, Rutlanders like
to recall, but the old-new county has not been completely isolated from
change. It might look like the rural idyll of England with its rolling
farmland and manicured villages, but the biggest landholdings have broken
up.
Farmers and commuters with smart cars now live together. This is Range Rover
and green wellie country. But, as one recently arrived but fiercely
chauvinistic Rutlander said haughtily: 'We may have wellies here, but they
have got mud on.'

FT  11 JUN 94 / Banham risks row over boundaries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT and JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Leicestershire will remain almost intact as a county, in spite of the
government's wishes, and Rutland will regain its independence after a lapse
of 20 years, under proposals from the Local Government Commission yesterday.
The commission also suggested that the city of Leicester should become a
unitary authority. However, Sir John Banham, commission chairman, risked
confrontation with the government by recommending that the rest of
Leicestershire should remain with two tiers of local authority - a county
and seven district councils.
Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, is a strong advocate of unitary
local government but he cannot deliver a unitary reorganisation unless this
has first been recommended by the commission.
Sir John, speaking in Rothley, Leicestershire, yesterday, distanced himself
from government policy favouring unitary authorities.
'In all the surveys we've done, the level of popular support for unitary
districts in shire England is very low indeed. People in shire England do
not want to see a Balkanisation of local government,' he said.
The recommendations mark the beginning of a new round of proposals from the
commission, which will announce plans for restructuring another 10 counties
next week.
The choices for Leicestershire reflect a general pattern in the commission's
recommendations, Sir John said. New authorities will generally have
populations of between 150,000 and 250,000 - fewer in urban areas and more
in sparsely populated rural areas.
But he stressed that there must be a demand for change, adding: 'If there is
not a clear message, our duty is to recommend no change. We are not in the
business of changing for its own sake - nor is parliament.'
Leicester is one of the largest English cities without its own city council,
and there is unlikely to be serious opposition to the plan to give it
unitary status.
Rutland was absorbed into Leicestershire as one of its district councils.
The justification for making it a unitary authority, in spite of a tiny
population of 33,000, is the strength of local community feeling, matched
only in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire, Sir John said.
The commission will now seek public response in Leicestershire to its
proposals, both by contacting every household with a leaflet and by
conducting polls. It said it would be equally happy if Leicestershire
abandons the county council and splits into five unitary authorities.
Local authority organisations were divided over the recommendations.
The Labour-controlled Association of County Councils said it was
'particularly worried about the impact of the commission's preferred
proposals on costs, services and accountability'.
It suggested that creating a new Rutland authority could cost an extra
Pounds 125 per household, and that it would be better that the historic
county of Rutland should be recreated only for 'ceremonial purposes'. The
cross-party Association of District Councils regretted that the commission
had not proposed a unitary structure for the whole of Leicestershire.

<TEXT>
Four consortia, three of which include large continental European and US
engineering groups, have been shortlisted to bid for the Pounds 2.7bn
high-speed rail link between London and the Channel tunnel by the Department
of Transport. They are:
EuroRail, the only all-British bid, involving a joint venture between BICC,
Trafalgar House and GEC. The bid is supported by bankers National
Westminster and HongKong and Shanghai Banking Corporation. Seeboard, the
electricity company, yesterday said it had accepted an invitation to join
the consortium.
London &amp; Continental Railways, involving UK consulting engineers Ove Arup
and Sir William Halcrow, Bechtel, the large US construction group,
Sofrerail, the French transport consultants, UK coach company National
Express, cement group Blue Circle and merchant bank SG Warburg.
A consortium led by Hochtief, the German construction group, supported by UK
construction and engineering group Costain, Nishimatsu Construction of
Japan, Siemens and Siemens Transport Systems of Germany, and Westinghouse,
the US engineering group.
A joint venture between UK construction groups John Mowlem and Taylor
Woodrow, the German construction company Philipp Holzmann, Transurb
Consultants of Belgium, and WS Atkins, the UK consulting engineers.
The rail link will run for 68 miles from Folkestone to a purpose-built
terminus at London St Pancras.
A hybrid bill authorising construction of the new line is expected to be
introduced in parliament in the autumn.
Until the new line is built European Passenger Services will operate
services to Paris and Brussels, starting this summer, from Waterloo station,
south London.

FT  11 JUN 94 / Party keen to make sure all candidates look like leaders:
Runners in the Labour leadership race start to declare
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The gun has fired for the start of Labour's leadership campaign, but the
rules under which the contest will be fought are still not clear. Labour's
procedure committee, chaired by Mr David Blunkett, the party chairman, will
not set out final guidelines until after nominations close on Thursday.
As a result, there is uncertainty about the extent to which the candidates
will be able to draw on Labour's publicity machine.
Party managers believe that Labour's lead in the opinion polls and its
strong performance in Thursday's by-elections reflects, in part, the
unofficial campaign waged since John Smith's death.
They are keen to make sure that all the candidates look like leaders -
especially on television. But the procedure committee has yet to decide how
far Labour's highly effective communications department should be involved
in leadership events.
The most likely approach is that the party's publicity machine will be told
to restrict itself to the technical role of assisting candidates to set up
meetings and interviews.
The issue is complicated by the department's continuing responsibility to
help publicise the candidates' shadow-cabinet responsibilities.
This means, for example, that it will continue to brief the media on Home
Office affairs for Mr Tony Blair, and on employment matters for Mr John
Prescott. It is not clear how the department will distinguish between the
party role and the leadership aspirations of Mrs Margaret Beckett, the
acting party leader.
The three main candidates are expected to give a series of high-profile
interviews over the weekend, , and all are expected to address the annual
conference of the GMB general union in Blackpool on Monday night, and the
TGWU general union in London on Thursday.
Mr Denzil Davies, former shadow defence secretary, could be a fourth
surprise candidate, although his ability to attract the 34 nominations he
needs remains in doubt.
Mr Robin Cook, who had seemed a strong candidate, said yesterday that he
would not stand. Without indicating who he would support in the contest, the
shadow trade and industry secretary said: 'I believe it is vital for the
health of the party that there should be a contest, and it is now clear that
there will be a contest. In those circumstances I do not intend to stand
myself.'

FT  11 JUN 94 / Beckett says she offers continuity and stability
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mrs Margaret Beckett yesterday claimed credit for Labour's decision to 'try
to drive' the Tories into third place in this week's Eastleigh by-election,
as she announced her intention to enter the contest to succeed John Smith as
Labour leader.
The MP for Derby South also made clear that she would enter the race for
deputy leader - a post to which she was first elected some two years ago.
She said that by declaring a vacancy from next month for the deputy leader's
post, she was ensuring that all candidates could enter the contest 'on equal
terms'.
Mrs Beckett was in confident mood after the widespread praise for her
performance as acting leader before this week's European elections and
parliamentary by-elections. She emphasised her experience and said she could
offer 'continuity and stability'.
'People don't have to guess what kind of leader I can be - they can see,'
she said. 'I believe I have the measure of John Major and I believe I would
have the measure of any of his successors.'
Asking party members to judge her on her 'ability to manage and unify' the
party and to 'communicate its ideals', Mrs Beckett sought to highlight her
expected appeal to female voters - 'whose votes Labour needs to win'.
Underlining the central role she has played in Labour's recent campaigns,
Mrs Beckett said it was her decision to try to push the Conservatives into
third place in this week's Eastleigh by-election - a result the party
achieved by a margin of some 1,500 votes.
'I have led our campaigning through two successful local election campaigns,
including the key London elections this year, a number of by-elections and
this year's Euro-elections,' she said. 'In all of these campaigns I have
played the key role behind the scenes as well as taking a full part on
stage.'
Women are likely to feature prominently among Mrs Beckett's key backers at
Westminster, although it remained unclear last night who would be running
her campaign. She appeared unaccompanied at yesterday's crowded press
conference, saying she was still 'in the very early stages of my campaign'.
Mrs Beckett, 51, may also get support from Labour's hard-left because of her
radical and fervently Euro-sceptic past.
Her vitriolic attack 13 years ago on Mr Neil Kinnock, the former Labour
leader, for his failure to back Mr Tony Benn, then running for deputy
leader, is still remembered.
But she has since built up a reputation as a tough-minded and unflappable
pragmatist, first as shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, where she
policed the spending instincts of her colleagues, and more recently as
deputy leader.
There was certainly no evidence of any hankering to return to her leftwing
roots yesterday, although she did make an early attempt to outflank Mr John
Prescott, one of her leadership rivals, on the issue of full employment that
he is putting at the heart of his campaign. Mrs Beckett said that as well as
aiming for 'the greatest possible level of employment', Labour should seek
new ways of enhancing workers' job security.
She said she did not believe that the implications for 'the financial
structure of this country' of the growth in performance pay and short-term
contracts had been properly thought through.
Mrs Beckett called on all candidates for the leadership to run for the
deputy leadership as well. She even said Mr Blair's name had been mentioned
in connection with the deputy leadership 'on a previous occasion'.

FT  11 JUN 94 / Speculation mounts over editor of Independent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Senior journalists at The Independent believe that its main founder Mr
Andreas Whittam Smith may soon decide to step down as editor.
Staff believe he may have privately taken the decision in the past week,
although nothing formal has been said and fellow directors of Newspaper
Publishing, the company that publishes The Independent, have not been
informed of any imminent change.
The intense speculation follows the motion of no confidence in Mr Whittam
Smith passed by journalists at the paper, and clear signs that the main
shareholders - El Pas of Spain and La Repubblica of Italy - have begun an
informal process of trying to find a new editor.
The uncertainty over Mr Whittam Smith comes as the latest official
circulation figures show a modest respite for both The Independent and The
Independent on Sunday.
Daily sales in May were 276,660, up from 271,372 in April, but for the six
months from the beginning of December to the end of May the drop was 18 per
cent compared with the same period last year. The Sunday paper sold 324,711
in May, up from 317,720 in April but down 13.7 per cent over the six-month
period.
The possible bottoming out of the circulation came as The Times recorded
sales of 517,575, a 42 per cent rise year-on-year and the highest
circulation in the paper's history.
The Daily Telegraph, which in April fell below 1m sales for the first time
for more than 40 years, dropped further in May. Sales averaged 993,395
compared with 998,921 in April and a December-to-May figure of 1.04m. The
Guardian, which fell to 397,172 in April, rose to 401,831 in May. The
Financial Times rose to 300,135 in May compared with 298,971 in April.

FT  11 JUN 94 / Motorway service-area freeholds to be sold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday announced plans to sell the freeholds of the 47
motorway service areas it owns.
However, potential purchasers predicted that hopes of raising substantial
sums would be disappointed.
Healey &amp; Baker, the estate agents engaged by the Highways Agency for the
sale, estimated that they might raise Pounds 25m. The operators of the
service stations, which are the most likely buyers, said they would be worth
much less.
Thirty-three sites will go on sale in the first tender round, due in
September, with the other 14 later.
The problem for the government is that service areas have at least 37 years
to run on 50-year leases, with the leaseholds requiring the payment of only
a peppercorn rent.
Purchasers would own an asset that would bring no return for a long time.
Forte, which has 25 motorway service stations, said the government had
initially indicated that the freeholds would be transferred automatically to
the operators.
Mr Richard Power, communications director, said: 'Going through a bidding
process is a nonsense. They were to have been transferred free. We won't pay
much more than a nominal amount. The only people to benefit will be the
consultants and the agents.'
Forte did, however, welcome the fact that ownership of the freehold would
remove some of the restrictions on activities that can be carried out at
service stations.
The service-station operators paid a total of Pounds 50m to acquire the
leases on the sites in the early 1980s.
Mr Power said: 'We paid a purchase premium in the first place so we have
already bought them once.'
Granada Hospitality, which has 20 sites, said it had not decided whether to
bid. The company said: 'It is not exactly the most exciting investment for
anyone who is not an existing tenant. You would have to have a very
long-term view.'
Healey &amp; Baker were more optimistic about the sale. Mr Gordon Pipe, a
partner, said: 'We expect an enormous interest from the operators. This will
give them more incentive to improve them. Property companies, investors and
the owners of land adjoining the service areas will also be interested.'
But Granada said it had not been dissuaded from investing in its sites by
the fact that it held only the leasehold. It had spent more than Pounds 15m
on improvements in the past few years.
The government first announced plans to deregulate motorway services in
1982, but it was not until January this year that it unveiled plans to allow
the private sector to build and operate 24 new service areas.
It reduced the minimum distance required between sites from 30 miles to 15
miles.

it had formed a strategic alliance with US-based benefits consultants The

Mr Philip Cobain, senior partner in charge of Watson's UK pension practice,

At its annual conference in Blackpool the union continued its opposition to
BT's Customer Service Improvement Programme, which is designed to introduce
more flexible working hours. The union insists that weekend working must
continue to attract overtime rates.
The union also overwhelmingly approved a merger with the postal workers'

FT  11 JUN 94 / Markham Main pit to reopen
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Markham Main colliery in South Yorkshire, which was closed by British Coal
in 1992, will be producing coal again by the winter.
Coal Investments, a company headed by former British Coal commercial
director Mr Malcolm Edwards, has taken over the pit near Doncaster on a
15-year lease and expects to start recruiting in August.
About 150 miners will be employed initially and a further 100 jobs may
follow. Coal Investments has already been granted licences to run four pits
in Stoke, Coventry and south Wales.

FT  11 JUN 94 / Poultry plant to create 450 jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sun Valley Poultry, the convenience-foods manufacturer, is to spend Pounds
32m on a food-processing plant at Wolverhampton, West Midlands, creating 450
jobs over four years, Paul Cheeseright writes.
The plant, part of a Pounds 100m expansion programme, is expected to open in
May.
Sun Valley Poultry is a subsidiary of Cargill, the US foods and agriculture
group. It will use the plant to process poultry either as branded products
or as own-label lines for retailers.
The plan is thought to be the largest single investment in the Wolverhampton
area for 60 years and is a fillip to the gradual restructuring of the local
economy away from heavy industry and engineering.
Sun Valley is receiving Pounds 2.75m of regional selective assistance from
the Department of Trade and Industry.

FT  11 JUN 94 / Prescott highlights full employment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Prescott yesterday threw his weight behind a target of 2.5 per cent
unemployment as he said he would contest both the Labour leadership and the
deputy leader's post.
Putting full employment at the centre of his campaign, the shadow employment
secretary acknowledged that the target was a 'very difficult goal' and could
take more than one parliamentary term to achieve.
He said full employment was 'an essential part of my socialism'. He aimed to
start a 'proper public debate' about how it should be achieved. 'We can and
must take the opportunity, as John Smith said, to provide work for all those
wanting work.'
The MP for Hull East, who ran for deputy leader in 1992, is regarded as one
of Labour's leading traditionalists. His strongest support in the six-week
contest is expected to come from predominantly blue-collar trade unionists.
But, although proud of his own union roots as a former seaman, he is not one
to swallow leftwing dogma unquestioned. As Labour's transport spokesman, he
was an early advocate of making it easier for publicly owned companies such
as British Rail to secure access to private finance.
He was keen to underline this point at yesterday's packed Westminster press
conference where he spoke of putting 'traditional values in a modern
setting'.
Last autumn he improved his standing within the party and won a mainstream
economic portfolio after his blistering speech at party conference played an
important part in ensuring that John Smith won the tense battle to inject
greater democracy into Labour's links with the unions.
Although he is known as a pugnacious extrovert only a small circle of MPs
enjoy Mr Prescott's absolute confidence. Two of them - Mr Richard Caborn,
the MP for Sheffield Central, and Mr Ian McCartney, MP for Makerfield -
shared the platform with him yesterday.
Mr Caborn, chairman of the trade and industry committee of MPs, will serve
as Mr Prescott's campaign committee chair and Mr McCartney as his campaign
co-ordinator.
Mr Prescott, who does not appear to have any firm commitments of support
from his shadow cabinet colleagues, yesterday laid much emphasis on the
importance of giving party members a 'real' choice in selecting the next
Labour leader.
He was also keen to highlight the new electoral procedures which his
conference speech helped to ensure would be put in place.
Labelling the leadership race as 'a turning-point in British political
history', Mr Prescott said it would involve 'more voters than participate in
national elections in countries such as Denmark and Ireland'.
In confident mood, Mr Prescott, 56, sidestepped questions on detailed policy
on the grounds that the party had a well-established policy-making
machinery.
But he said he had been heartened by the 'tremendous public support' for 'my
strong commitment to positive employment rights for all workers . . . and to
the introduction of a statutory minimum wage'.
He said he wanted to introduce a 'positive framework of law' to guarantee
such rights. Where the government had opted out of its international
obligations, he said, 'we will correct that and that clearly will need
legislation'.
His pitch for deputy leader two years ago centred almost exclusively on the
need to turn the job into an organisational post, charged with
reinvigorating the party grassroots, raising membership, boosting the
campaigning focus and shifting party resources to Labour's regional centres.
He has long argued that Labour's message to its traditional working-class
supporters and others, has been lost behind public-relations gloss.

FT  11 JUN 94 / BBC dispute returns to Acas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Talks between the BBC and its main broadcasting unions will resume at Acas,
the conciliation service, on Monday in a further attempt to resolve the
dispute that has already led to two 24-hour strikes.
The BBC offer to return to Acas to clarify its final package came after
Bectu, the main technical union, and the National Union of Journalists
decided to call off industrial action planned for tomorrow, the day of the
European election results.
Unions were also encouraged by the willingness of the BBC management to
discuss the detail of the terms of employment - a key factor behind the
dispute.
As a result of the signs of flexibility further industrial action planned
for Tuesday has also been dropped although the unions have given no
commitment beyond then.
The dispute is about the implementation of performance pay and some terms
and conditions of employment which can in future be subject to negotiation
in individual BBC directorates rather than centrally.
Movement came yesterday after a letter to staff from Mr John Birt, the
director-general, saying that the BBC needed a closer link between pay and
individual performance. Mr Birt said: 'Annual increments - raising pay
automatically because someone remains in the job - are antiquated and have
no place in a modern workplace.'
He warned, however, that if there were any further industrial action the BBC
would invoke formal procedures which would almost certainly lead to
suspension of striking staff.
A continuing series of strikes could not come at a more potentially
embarrassing moment for the BBC.
The government is in the final stages of completing a white paper on the
future of the corporation which is due to be published this month or next.
It would be difficult for the BBC management to decide that a 'final offer'
was not final after all.
The return to Acas also helps union leaders who do not want to be seen to be
responding to threats of suspension.

FT  11 JUN 94 / Deregulation has 'failed' Britain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour will next week launch a strong attack on the 'appalling failure' of
the government's policy of deregulation, saying that it has had 'enormous
social repercussions' in unemployment, poverty and crime.
The party will use its 29-page response to the European Commission's green
paper on social policy to call for new voluntary one-year work programmes
for the long-term unemployed and to underline its support for a statutory
minimum wage.
This would be set at 'a fair rate . . . in compensation for the work
undertaken'.
On deregulation, Labour will claim that the government's policies have
resulted in:
The worst GDP growth among the G7 nations between 1979 and 1993.
The highest unit labour costs in the tradeable sector.
The lowest skill level among the G7.
It will dismiss as 'facile' the argument that Britain must force down wages
and benefits if it is to compete with Asian 'tigers' such as Thailand and
Korea. 'Society will not tolerate the misery and unrest which would have to
accompany this route.'
Acknowledging that it is crucial to 'enable wealth creators to provide
employment', the paper will argue that governments 'cannot avoid their
responsibilities to intervene when free markets fail'.
Drawn up by a team under Mr John Prescott, shadow employment secretary, the
document will call for new temporary work programmes after discussions with
employers and others to minimise job substitution and 'dead-weight effects'.
There should be 'no compulsions' to participate in such programmes, while
participants should be paid under a 'rate-for-the-job formula'.
The paper commits Labour to adopting the social chapter and preparing a UK
bill of rights.

FT  11 JUN 94 / Companies in Japan see rise in confidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japanese business confidence improved in May for the first time in five
years and is set to brighten further in the coming months, the Bank of Japan
said yesterday.
The index of manufacturers' sentiment in the bank's Tankan quarterly survey,
Japan's most authoritative barometer of the short term economic outlook,
rose to -50 in May, from -56 in the previous review in February.
Service industries' prospects improved from -47 to -46 over the same period.
The index shows the percentage balance between those reporting good and bad
conditions.
However, the survey indicated that the outlook for recovery was only
moderate, triggering a slight decline in the Nikkei index, down by 7.60
points on the day, to 21,395.18, so breaking a spectacular three-day rise.
'We see a bumpy road ahead,' warned Mr Kagehide Kaku, director of the BOJ's
research and statistics department.
'The economy is turning round, but the level is still low . . . there is
still a large difference between supply and demand,' said Mr Hirohiko
Okumura, chief economist at Nomura Research Institute.
However, yesterday's Tankan was good enough to reduce the likelihood of a
drop in the official discount rate, said equity analysts. It will instead
reinforce the bank's eagerness to avoid allowing another liquidity driven
rise in asset prices like the one that preceded the recession.
The survey, of just over 10,000 companies, shows that corporate confidence
has merely recovered to nearly the same level as May last year, though it
forecasts a further improvement to -42 in September.
The result was, unusually, in line with what companies forecast three months
ago, rather than below expectations, suggesting that corporate Japan has
scaled back hopes in line with economic reality.
Encouraging signs include a reduction in inventories of unsold goods held by
both producers and wholesalers, thanks to production cuts and a modest
recovery in demand. The gap between excess supply and weak demand has
narrowed, but prices are still weak, said the bank. The balance of companies
reporting excess supply fell to from 55, in the previous survey, to 50.
The balance of companies with too many workers fell from 28 to 26 over the
same period, a sign of progress in cutting costs. Yet this is still high
enough to show that larger job cuts are on the way, said Mr Jim Vestal,
chief economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd in Tokyo.
Manufacturers believe turnover will stagnate this year, according to the
survey, but that pre-tax profits will rise by 14.9 per cent, thanks to lower
raw materials and fixed costs. Service industries forecast a 5.0 per cent
profits fall on a small decline in sales.
One consequence of the continued excess capacity highlighted in the survey
is that companies, overall, plan to reduce fixed investments for the third
year running, by 3.7 per cent and 6.3 per cent for manufacturers. This
conflicts with a recent Ministry of International Trade and Industry survey
showing a rise in capital investment this year.
A rising balance of companies, 17 as against 14 in the previous Tankan,
reported that banks are being accommodative over lending money, so reducing
fears of a credit squeeze. A rising proportion reported that financial
conditions were tight, which the bank said mirrors the rise in long term
lending rates.

FT  11 JUN 94 / US judge orders Microsoft recall
</HEADLINE>

   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A US federal judge has ordered Microsoft to recall versions of its personal
computer operating system MS-DOS that contain data compression technology
found by the court to have violated patents held by Stac Electronics, a
small Californian software company.
MS-DOS is used by millions of PC users. The worldwide recall covers
offending ver sions of the MS-DOS operating system software, and computers
containing the software, that are currently in computer stores. Copies of
the Microsoft program already in use by PC buyers are not affected by the
recall.
The judge also issued a permanent injunction ordering Microsoft to stop
making, using and selling MS-DOS 6.0 and 6.2 versions of the software that
contain a feature called 'DoubleSpace' that doubles the amount of data that
can be stored on a PC hard disk.
The injunction follows a February jury decision that Micro soft's
DoubleSpace technology infringes two patents owned by Stac Electronics.
Microsoft was also ordered to pay Stac Dollars 120m in compensatory damages.
Microsoft has said that it will appeal against the verdict and said
yesterday it would also ask the Federal Appellate Court to stay the
injunction and recall the order.
Microsoft has already shipped a new version of MS-DOS with the offending
features expunged, to 1500 PC manufacturers.
The company was unable to estimate the volume of products that could be
affected by the recall.
Industry analysts said, however, that the recall could cause significant
disruption in the PC market if thousands of computers are pulled off
dealers' shelves worldwide.

FT  11 JUN 94 / North Korean nuclear crisis deepens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL and MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The crisis over North Korea's nuclear capabilities deepened yesterday as the
US said it was increasing its intelligence efforts to prepare for the
possible use of nuclear weapons by Pyongyang.
President Clinton met with senior defence and foreign policy advisers at the
White House and made it clear in talks by telephone with his South Korean
counterpart, Kim Young-sam, that the US was seeking punitive United Nations
sanctions against the North for its suspected nuclear programme. A draft UN
resolution is expected to be drawn up next week.
Mr Ashton Carter, US assistant secretary of defence, said North Korea had
ballistic missiles and 'they may have other things as well.' The US has said
that North Korea is believed to have as many as two nuclear weapons and is
developing more. He said the US would quickly send more warplanes, ships and
troops to the tense peninsula in the event of trouble.
Even more sharply, assistant Secretary of State Robert Gallucci said in an
appearance before a convention on nuclear arms control that President
Clinton had made clear if a nuclear weapon were used by North Korea 'that
would be the end of the North Korean state.'
In Vienna, North Korea said it could no longer guarantee continuity of
nuclear safeguards and would ask two United Nations inspectors to leave the
country. 'We will not allow any of the verification activity, which is now
under way,' Mr Yun Ho-jin, a North Korean envoy, said.
The statement came after the board of the International Atomic Energy Agency
adopted a resolution condemning North Korea for violating safeguards
agreements by refusing inspectors access to sites suspected of involvement
in the secret production of nuclear weapons.
The board also suspended technical aid. China abstained on the vote. Though
limited in scope, the cut off in aid amounts to the first formal sanctions
against North Korea.
An intensive week of diplomatic shuttling by foreign ministers and officials
has so far failed to forge a common position on measures to be taken to
punish Pyongyang for its refusal to open its facilities to inspection.
China has refused to play ball, while Russia and to a lesser extent Japan
have been reluctant to give strong backing for a UN resolution.
In Istanbul Mr Warren Christopher ,the US secretary of State held talks on
North Korea with Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev on the fringes of a
Nato meeting with former communist adversaries, but had yet to reach
complete accord with Russia which first wanted an international conference
held on the issue. Mr Christopher however said he expected the US 'to be
putting forward a (sanctions) resolution within a few days' at the UN.
China has so far resolutely opposed sanctions. Yesterday President Jiang
Zemin said: 'Sanctions could have serious consequences, and China is against
such sanctions.'
Diplomatic efforts will continue today as Mr Koji Kakizawa, Japan's foreign
minister, goes to Seoul for meetings with President Kim Young-sam and
foreign minister Han Sung-joo. On Sunday, Mr Kakizawa will meet Qian Qichen,
China's foreign minister, to urge renewed efforts by Beijing to get the
North to permit inspections.
Mr Kakizawa will relay to China's leaders the hardening resolve of the
international community and urge them not to block a possible UN Security
Council resolution. Japan will co-operate with UN sanctions, but believes
efforts to seek a diplomatic solution should be continued to the last
minute.
Yesterday, Mr Kakizawa met Mr Peter Tarnoff, US undersecretary of state for
political affairs, and stressed China's role in a peaceful solution.

FT  11 JUN 94 / Beijing defies west with N-test
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China yesterday conducted its second underground nuclear test in less than a
year in defiance of a US-sponsored informal international moratorium.
The White House said it 'deeply regrets' the test and urged China to refrain
from future testing, while Japan called the test 'regrettable'.
China's foreign ministry, anticipating international criticism, said Beijing
fully supported a comprehensive nuclear test ban, but reserved the right to
continue testing in the meantime.
'China has all along exercised great restraint in conducting nuclear tests
and the number . . . is extremely limited,' the statement said.
The US conducted its last test in 1992. President Bill Clinton recently
extended the US ban on testing until 1995.
China's latest test is consistent with its desire to develop a defence
capability commensurate with its growing economic and political importance.
Yesterday's detonation was conducted at China's Lop Nor test site in remote
Xinjiang province. Preparations, detected by Western 'spy' satellites, had
been under way for weeks.
China provided few details but in London the Verification Technology
Information Centre said the test was estimated to be of medium yield at
between 10 and 60 kilotons.
The foreign ministry statement repeated China's call for 'nuclear weapons
states to give up their policy of nuclear deterrence and commit themselves
in explicit terms to complete prohibition and thorough destruction of
nuclear weapons'.
China is among 38 nations involved in the Conference on Disarmament which
began in January negotiating a comprehensive test ban treaty. China
yesterday urged that the treaty be concluded by 1996. But Beijing has made
no secret of its suspicion of the motives of the US and 'nuclear club'
allies in seeking a moratorium on testing.
China's arsenal of nuclear weapons is said to number between 250-300
warheads - the smallest among the five declared members of the nuclear club,
including the US, Russia, Britain and France. Israel, India and Pakistan are
also believed to possess a nuclear capability.

FT  11 JUN 94 / Civilians bear the brunt of drive to capture Aden: Missiles
and shells take their toll
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
North Yemeni officials continue to insist they are not targeting civilians
in their drive to capture Aden. But civilian casualities in the city and in
Yemen's southern region have mounted steadily as northern bombs, missiles
and artillery miss their targets and hit innocent neighbourhoods - killing
men, women and children in the process.
But these are only the most obvious victims in a city that is beginning to
suffer from shortages of water, food and medicines.
Dr Mohsen bin Hammam, chairman of the Jumhurriya hospital, recites a grim
roll of statistics. 'On Sunday at Dar Saad 27 were killed and 45 wounded. On
Monday in Khormaksar 12 were killed and 22 injured. On Tuesday  ..'
Upstairs at the hospital are some of the wounded. An elderly man sits on the
edge of his bed, his left arm now a stump covered with soft gauze. He stares
uncomprehendingly. A 17-year-old boy rests on the bed opposite, his right
arm missing and a seam of stitches running down from his rib cage to his
groin.
Nearby, a four-year-old girl lies with her head bandaged, her tiny arms and
legs drawn up into a foetal position. Semi-conscious, she emits a continuous
low moan.
Nurses say the girl, named Fatma, was caught in the shelling of nearby
Wahad. She may live.
Jumhurriya hospital was built by the British, says Dr Ahmed Bilal, a
specialist in chest surgery. He walks around to the entrance and proudly
points to an inscribed stone: 'This stone was laid by Her Majesty Queen
Elizabeth II on the 27th April 1954.'
Yemen's civil war broke out 40 years later to the day on April 27 this year.
The hospital was, in its time, the finest in the Middle East and drew
patients from throughout the region. It has suffered with age and use and is
full of wilting equipment. But the doctors and nurses pay little attention
to the state of their hospital. They are too busy using it, caring for 80
per cent of Aden's civilian casualties.
They are working against the odds. 'Casualties come all at once. The
missiles, the bombs, or the shells hit and we are suddenly inundated with
the dead and wounded,' Dr Hammam says.
The hospital has only one ambulance and patients are brought in by any means
available. Even so there are more casualties than doctors can immediately
cope with. 'Every day we open six operating theatres and most of our work is
successful. We have only one neuro-surgeon and two orthopedic surgeons. All
the rest are general surgeons,' Dr Hammam says, 'but everyone is doing their
best, 24 hours a day.'
Five weeks ago the northern leader General Ali Abdullah Saleh told
southerners he would not bomb their cities, assuring them it would therefore
be unnecessary to flee their homes. But Aden is now full of refugees from
cities, towns and villages that have been hit repeatedly by the artillery of
the advancing northern army.
Northern officials have often and publicly denied attacking the refinery,
the power station and the water system in Aden. Such utilities, they say,
belong to the people.
And yet the refinery became a smoking ruin last Sunday, electrical power
fluctuates, and - in 37 degree heat - there is no running water in the city.
Mr Abdullah Saidi, director of the Bir Nasser pumping station, says that
there are 45 wells which supply Aden with fresh water.
Shelling by northern forces, he says, has cut cables and pipes which enable
water to reach the city. He and his men have tried to repair the damage, but
northern shells hamper their work.
'We can only work on seven wells because of the shelling and each time we
fix something they destroy it,' he says.
Mr Saidi says that these seven wells alone would supply about one-third of
Aden's water needs. Even under normal circumstances Mr Saidi and his men
would need a month to repair all the damage done to the water pumping
station. But northern shells, he says, sometime come at the rate of one a
minute.
As shells explode around the edges of the city, as warplanes tear through
it, and as troops stand poised for their final assault, Adenis carry on.
They bathe in the sea, draw water from wells drilled into the streets, and,
always, they queue up.
At the hospital, another patient is rolled into the emergency room. For
hours there has been no water in the taps. But outside a dented blue tanker
truck has just arrived and workers are busy with clear plastic pipes,
running the sparkling new supply into storage tanks. For a few more hours,
at least, there will be enough to serve the hundreds of civilian casualties
inside, targets or not.

FT  11 JUN 94 / Domestic problems mar Clinton's return
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Images of war cemeteries, military bands and proud old veterans have
surrounded President Bill Clinton for the last week, but they have done
little to change the landscape that awaited him on his return from Europe to
Washington.
The problems of Haiti, North Korea and Bosnia festered still, while on the
domestic front neither opinion polls nor election results offered the
president much comfort.
In a Gallup poll conducted for CNN and USA Today, only 49 per cent of those
questioned found Mr Clinton honest and trustworthy, although 78 per cent
thought him 'a nice guy.'
Meanwhile, candidates from Mr Clinton's own Democratic party continued to
distance themselves from him, and even the Democratic National Committee's
political director acknowledged that 'there are clearly some areas of the
country where it's not going to benefit a candidate to associate himself
with Bill Clinton' - a remark swiftly repudiated by the White House.
By general consensus, Mr Clinton struck just the right tone in his various
D-Day commemoration speeches, successfully soothing the niggling feeling
that his seat at these ceremonies would have been more appropriately filled
by former President George Bush, himself a second world war veteran.
However, his visit to Oxford, to the despair of some of his political
advisers, then presented a target few American journalists could resist.
'The student who came here avoiding military service and protesting a war
returned as president praising military service and avoiding the
protesters,' quipped Mr Brit Hume, correspondent of the ABC television
network.
The net effect on Mr Clinton's position is probably neutral as he approaches
three crucial weeks before the July 4 congressional recess.
Next week, the president is expected to unveil his proposals for 'ending
welfare as we know it,' a plan built around limiting benefits from the Aid
to Families with Dependent Children programme, the cornerstone of the US
social safety net, to two years.
But the ambitious reform programme, despite considerable support from both
parties in Congress, is probably stalled until next year, at the earliest,
as it must take second place on the legislative agenda to health care reform
Health care reform is making only slow progress, and Mr Clinton faces a
decision on how soon to involve himself in the struggle. Until now, the
White House has left the Congress to fight over the details, but the
president's own weight will be needed to push reform through.
The battle of health care has not been made any easier by the indictment of
Congressman Dan Rostenkowski, formerly chairman of the ways and means
committee, on charges of fraud and embezzlement.
Mr Rostenkowski was due to be arraigned in court yesterday, and was expected
to plead not guilty.
Mr Clinton's own legal travails, meanwhile, have not gone away during his
trip to Europe. In the next few weeks he will have to respond to the charges
of sexual harassment filed against him by a former Arkansas state employee.
Congressional hearings on his investment in the Whitewater property venture
are also expected to begin next month, although the Republicans and the
Democrats continue to wrangle about their scope.

The Greens achieved a breakthrough in Ireland, while anti-EU parties gained
ground in Denmark, according to initial projections yesterday of the results
of Thursday's European Parliament voting.
Final results from the elections in Britain, the Netherlands, Ireland and
Denmark will not be known until tomorrow after the rest of the 12-nation EU
has voted for the Strasbourg-based parliament.
In the Netherlands, the main feature of Thursday's poll was a slump in voter
turnout to an all-time low of 35 per cent, down sharply from 47 per cent
five years ago.
However, the Christian Democrats of outgoing Dutch prime minister Ruud
Lubbers took heart from unofficial exit polls showing they emerged as the
strongest party in the election.
If confirmed, this would mean they would regain the position they lost to
Labour in national elections in May.
Exit polls showed that the Christian Democrats won 10 seats and Labour
eight. This would equal both parties' current representation, but mean a
relative decline, as the number of Dutch seats has been increased by six to
31.
Dutch political analysts said the low turnout benefited the Christian
Democrats and worked against Labour.
In Ireland, an unofficial count pointed to the Greens winning at least one,
and possibly two, of the 15 Irish seats.
Overturning poll predictions that the Greens would be weak outsiders, Ms Pat
McKenna, the party's candidate in the four-seat Dublin constituency, topped
the poll, according to figures collected by the main parties at the counting
station.
The two coalition parties, Fianna Fail and Labour, both suffered a drop in
first preference votes, although Fianna Fail looks set to achieve its target
of winning seven seats.
In Denmark, two anti-EU groups with no representation in Denmark's own
parliament, the People's Anti-EU Movement and the June Movement, looked set
to get five of the country's 16 Strasbourg seats, according to exit polls.

FT  11 JUN 94 / Groupe Schneider plans to call in outside auditor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Groupe Schneider is to call in an outside auditor to examine its tangled
relationship with Belgian and offshore subsidiaries, with a view to clearing
its president of fraud and swindling charges, the company said yesterday.
Attending his first board meeting since his release on bail from a Brussels
prison on Tuesday, Mr Didier Pineau-Valencienne got the board's 'unanimous
support and total confidence' that 'he had always acted in the interests of
all shareholders', a company statement said.
In an interview with Le Monde newspaper yesterday, Mr Pineau-Valencienne
said that with the board renewing its confidence in him, he was resuming his
functions as president and would be able to tell shareholders at next
Thursday's annual general meeting that the group was in good shape.
Expounding at length in the interview on his innocence of the charges
levelled at him by the Belgian judge, Mr Jean-Claude Van Espen, Mr
Pineau-Valencienne claimed that Schneider 'has never received, directly or
indirectly, any money from offshore subsidaries, other than through the
Belgian companies of Cofibel and Cofimines'.
Minority shareholders in those two companies had complained that Schneider
had cut them out of dividends due from Swiss and Panamian subsidaries, a
charge central to the Belgian investigation.
For the first time, Mr Pineau-Valencienne spoke publicly of the complicated
arrangements that the Belgian part of Schneider had put in place to manage
Zairean mining interests, involving a Swiss trust managing the Panamian
companies of Mitraco and Tramico. But he said their net worth was virtually
nil by this year, when they were apparently sold for a symbolic one franc.
He admitted that Scheider had made a mistake in investing in a company
called PB Finance, whose activities are the object of a separate
investigation by Judge Van Espen. But this investment had been made by the
late Mr Jean Verdoot, to whom Mr Pineau-Valencienne said he had left the
running of Schneider's Belgian interests after 1985.
The Schneider president protested at the way he had been initially
questioned almost continuously from 10am on May 26 until 5am the following
day, only then to be told that he was to be held in prison. This, he said,
was 'neither necessary or justified'.

FT  11 JUN 94 / Yeltsin decree lifts curbs on foreign banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOLTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Boris Yeltsin, in a further push for economic reform, announced
yesterday that he had signed a long-awaited decree lifting severe
operational restrictions on western banks.
Accompanied by other measures such as the introduction of long-term housing
mortgages, the banking decree was a pre-condition for European union
ministers to endorse at a meeting in Luxembourg on Monday a partnership and
co-operation treaty with Russia.
Mr Yeltsin said the decree, which lists only those restrictions slapped
retroactively on half a dozen western banks which had previously received
full Russian banking licences, would 'spark criticism' from Russian banks
eager for protection from western competition. EU diplomats said
restrictions would be removed not just on EU banks but on US, Turkish and
Swiss banks which also suffered from the ban on banks taking deposits from
Russian customers.
'There must be gradual, cautious involvement of foreign banks in our
commercial and financial life,' Mr Yeltsin said.
He gave no details on the decree, which he said would also regulate local
banks and strengthen the central bank.
Last November Moscow froze new foreign bank entry to Russia until 1996,
imposed offshore status on licensed foreign banks and barred them from
dealing with Russian clients, in a decree aimed at wooing the country's
strong anti-western banking lobby.
However, the EU treaty to be signed in Corfu on June 20 still gives Russia
the right to close its fledgling financial markets to Europeans who may wish
to join it in future.
Mr Yeltsin for the first time also promised action to clean up Russia's
virtually unregulated financial markets. He said he planned a decree which
would combat fraudulent financial advertising and offer some protection to
millions of small shareholders created overnight by Russia's mass
privatisation campaign.
But he also badly let down a key reformer, Mr Anatoly Chubais, the deputy
prime minister for privatisation, by publicly ordering him not to try to
stop the Moscow mayor's 'special' privatisation plan which basically
short-circuits Mr Chubais's nationwide programme.
However, the Russian leader took a courageous stand under intense pressure
from the country's defence lobby for an increase in military expenditure
which would wreck the 1994 budget approved by the lower chamber of
parliament on Wednesday.
He told the military that the only way they would get extra finance would be
through non-budgetary sources - such as arms sales like a recent Dollars
550m (Pounds 367m) aircraft sale to Malaysia. He also told them they had to
do more to cut military procurement as well as Russia's 3m-strong army.
Finally, he said he had ordered the Interior Ministry and domestic
intelligence service to cleanse Russia of 'criminal filth', saying gangsters
were trying to grab hold of the economy and even to get into politics.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Carl Bildt, Sweden's prime minister, said the uphill task of persuading
Swedes to vote to join the EU this autumn would be even more difficult if
fellow-applicant Austria rejects membership in its referendum tomorrow.
But he admitted the severe doubts over the outcome of Sweden's November
plebiscite on the issue were unlikely to be dispelled by an Austrian Yes
vote, or by Finnish acceptance of membership in a similar referendum due in
October.
'We can be affected negatively if things go wrong (in Austria) - not to
mention the major catastrophe if things go wrong in both countries that will
hold a referendum before us. Whether there will be an effect in the other
direction - a positive effect (from a Yes vote) - is more doubtful,' he said
in an interview with the Financial Times.
Mr Bildt, who originally wanted to hold the Swedish referendum later this
month, expressed concern that the EU issue would be eclipsed by the campaign
for the general election on September 18, and the formation of a new
government in October. This would leave little time afterwards to overturn
opinion, at present running strongly against membership.
Mr Bildt, who leads a right-centre coalition, was sharply critical of the
leadership of the opposition Social Democratic party, the majority of whose
supporters are opposed to the EU, for not campaigning more actively for a
Yes vote: 'It is strange that the largest party in Sweden has not taken a
position on the largest issue in Sweden. . . I fear that we are past the
point at which it will be possible for the Social Democrats to get a
majority of their people on the Yes side.'
Mr Ingvar Carlsson, the Social Democratic leader, denied he was ducking the
EU question. But he said the general election should be fought on domestic
issues, leaving the EU campaign for afterwards. He said Mr Bildt's strident
advocacy of membership was alienating many voters: 'Every time he speaks, we
lose more votes to the No side.'

FT  11 JUN 94 / Russia looks to closer western ties soon: Meeting of Nato
and former Warsaw Pact ministers becomes 'trench warfare'
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Russia yesterday held out the prospect of a broad and rapid improvement in
its relations with the west, but it surprised some western officials by the
toughness of its terms.
President Boris Yeltsin said in Moscow that he hoped to attend the
forthcoming European Union summit in Corfu, and sign a wide-ranging
co-operation agreement, and he also expected to play a full part in the
political discussions of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations in
Naples next month.
Mr Andrei Kozyrev, Russian foreign minister, said in Istanbul that he hoped
to sign a military co-operation deal with Nato in the very near future. This
fuelled anticipation that the agreement could be sealed before the Naples
summit and possibly before the Corfu meeting.
However, a meeting in Istanbul of foreign ministers from Nato and its former
Warsaw Pact enemies degenerated into an angry five-hour haggling session
after Russia held its ground on a series of sensitive points.
At Russia's insistence, the ministers in Istanbul dropped language from
their final communique that would have held out the prospect of full Nato
membership for Moscow's former satellite countries. Nato officials said this
did not change the fact that the alliance was still open to central and east
European countries, but there was undisguised irritation at the toughness of
Russia's stance.
Some key procedural questions that need to be solved before Russia's
co-operation deal with Nato goes ahead were also left outstanding, and this
clouded the prospects for an early signing ceremony in Brussels.
Mr Kozyrev insisted that he would only travel to Brussels and sign up to
Partnership For Peace (PFP) if the broader relationship betwen Russia and
Nato had been agreed in principle and could take effect immediately. 'I can
only afford to come to Brussels once,' said Mr Kozyrev, signalling his
refusal to accept the procedures which have been required of the other 20
countries that have adhered to PFP, a military co-operation programme
devised by Nato.
The 20 existing members were told they must sign up first and discuss
details later, but Russia has pressed for an informal waiver from this
principle.
Mr Sergio Balanzino, acting secretary general of Nato, said he expected Mr
Kozyrev to come to Brussels and sign the PFP entry form as well as
exchanging documents that would record the two sides' understanding of how
Moscow and the alliance would work together.
Other issues that held up agreement in Istanbul included Russia's insistence
on greater freedom of action to mediate in the fighting between Armenia and
Azerbaijan. Moscow also held out for diplomatic language that would leave
open the possibility of acceptance of Russian demands for an increase in the
troop numbers it is allowed under the agreement on Conventional Forces in
Europe. The ministers were also forced to drop language that would have
welcomed the recent agreement under which nine east European nations were
associated with the Western European Union.
A senior alliance official described the angry five-hour exchange as 'trench
warfare of a kind that should not have disgraced a meeting at this level'.
Mr Balanzino said the difficulty of the negotiations might have reflected
the fact that Mr Kozyrev and most other ministers had left the conference
hall and were allowing senior diplomats to argue their case.
He said it was possible that Russia might have shown greater flexibility if
it had been represented by Mr Kozyrev in person. However, other alliance
diplomats said they saw no reason to doubt the fact that Russia's diplomats
were acting on direct instructions from their political masters.
'I have not seen negotiating tactics like this from Russia since we settled
the terms for German unification nearly five years ago,' said one diplomat.

Mr Jerome Monod, president of Lyonnaise des Eaux, yesterday threatened legal
action against Mr Thierry Jean-Pierre, a magistrate running in tomorrow's
European Parliament election, for alleging that Lyonnaise used bribes to win
water contracts and covered the cost by raising water charges to consumers,
David Buchan writes from Paris.
Mr Monod made his threat after anxious questioning about the 'political
corruption' allegations by some shareholders at Lyonnaise's annual general
meeting on Thursday and a slide on the same day in the share price of
Lyonnaise and also that of Generale des Eaux, the other big French utility
and communications group to be the target of Mr Jean-Pierre's recent
allegations in local and international newspapers. Generale des Eaux asked
the COB, which regulates the Paris Bourse, to put trading in its shares
under surveillance.
Mr Monod told his shareholders that he 'could not prevent the subsidiaries
(of Lyonnaise des Eauxz) from doing what is possible, permitted and
solicited with insistence' by political parties.
Lyonnaise argues that the differences in water charges across France reflect
differences in costs and that the tariffs are in any case under the control
of local authorities with which Lyonnaise has its contracts.

Hopes rose yesterday that the kidnapping of two Britons in Indian-held
Kashmir might be ended quickly. The Harakat-ul-Ansar group told Reuter in
Srinagar it had held the Britons because they had 'strayed into our camp
area in a suspicious way. We will release them as soon as we have shifted
our camps.' However, officials were treating the undertaking with caution
because previous statements by the group have been contradictory.
Mr Kim Housego, 16, and Mr David Mackie, 36, were abducted on Tuesday by
Moslem militants who originally demanded the release of three jailed
guerrilla leaders.
Mr David Fitton, first secretary of the British High Commission in New
Delhi, said the rebels had allowed a local doctor to visit the hostages to
examine Mr Mackie, who had injured his knee. Mr Fitton, who is in Srinagar,
said the Kashmiri doctor discovered that both captives were in good
condition.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Germany's Upper House, which is dominated by the opposition Social
Democrats, yesterday threw out a draft law which would have granted a
limited right to compensation and restitution for some former property
owners in eastern Germany. The decision is likely to hold up investment in
the eastern states, particularly for agricultural land. The draft law,
passed after several attempts by the Bundestag, the lower house, last month
had aimed at resolving outstanding property rights disputes in eastern
Germany by allowing those whose land was expropriated by the Soviet
authorities, which had administered eastern Germany between 1945 and 1949,
the right to buy back back at reduced prices a certain amount of their
property.
Unlike those whose land was seized by the Nazis between 1933 and 1945, or by
the east German communists between 1949 and 1990, property owners between
1945 and 1949 had not been entitled to either restitution or compensation.
Many of them had owned vast tracts of land, especially in the northern state
of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, and formed the backbone of Prussia's aristocratic
families. But the land had been expropriated by the Soviet authorities after
the second world war.

Token strikes by thousands of postal and telephone workers disrupted
services in Germany yesterday, as Mr Wolfgang Botsch, the post minister,
warned that the dispute threatened the entire privatisation programme for
Deutsche Telekom. The minister held emergency talks with employers and trade
union leaders in an attempt to restart negotiations between them, focused on
the maintenance of workers' benefits after privatisation.
He said he was now 'sceptical' about the chances of finalising the reform of
the postal and telecommunications services before the October general
election. Mr Kurt van Haaren, the postal union leader, said he expected
negotiations to be resumed, but expressed little hope for a swift solution.
If the dispute continues, it will put in doubt support for postal reform,
including the privatisation of the telecommunications monopoly, from the
opposition Social Democratic party. The reform bill has to be approved by
the Bundestag, the lower house of parliament, by June 29 if it is to stand a
chance of becoming law before the end of the current legislative period in
September.

The underlying rate of US producer price inflation is rising despite a fall

Leading economists yesterday predicted that price pressures at the wholesale
level would result in higher consumer price inflation next year.
The Labour Department said 'core' producer prices - which exclude the
volatile food and energy items - rose 0.4 per cent between April and May,
more than most analysts expected. Core producer prices rose at an annual
rate of 3.1 per cent in the first five months of this year, a significant
acceleration when compared with a rise of 0.3 per cent for 1993 as a whole.
The latest consensus forecast, compiled from projections by 52 leading 'blue
chip' forecasters, published yesterday, predicts that consumer price
inflation will rise to 3.3 per cent next year from 2.7 per cent this year.
Last month's prices pressures, however, were masked by large, erratic
declines in the price of food (down 0.9 per cent from April) and energy
(down 1.0 per cent). The overall producer price index thus fell 0.1 per cent
last month following a 0.1 per cent decline in April. Prices were down 0.4
per cent in the year to May.

FT  11 JUN 94 / Austrians likely to support entry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   VIENNA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Austria's voters look set to vote narrowly in support of joining the
European Union in a referendum tomorrow.
The latest Gallup opinion poll on Thursday indicated that 57 per cent of
Austrians favoured membership, against only 28 per cent who would probably
cast 'No' ballots.
Earlier polls showed the two sides evenly balanced, with many voters
undecided. Austrians are known for making up their minds about voting only
at the last minute.
Investors have apparently accepted the message of the Gallup poll, buying
shares heavily on the Vienna Borse in the past three days. In the previous
six sessions, the ATX index of leading shares lost 5 per cent of its value
as fears of a rejection of the EU spread.
The campaign ended yesterday on the shrill tone that dominated debate in the
closing days. A story that Austrians would have to buy Spanish-made yoghurt
containing a harmful bacterial colouring agent was put about by right-wing
leader Mr Jorg Haider.
And the conservative Austrian People's party staged a rousing 60th birthday
party at Vienna's Hofburg Palace for Mr Alois Mock, the popular foreign
minister, who has fought passionately for the EU cause. Mr Mock has won
immense sympathy for his tireless campaigning in spite of a debilitating
nervous system disease.
The referendum result will be known early tomorrow evening.

FT  11 JUN 94 / Blair puts 'national renewal' at top of agenda for Labour:
Favourite in leadership contest sets out strategy to fight next election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tony Blair staked his claim to the Labour leadership yesterday by setting
out a new economic and social agenda to redefine the ground on which the
party will fight the next general election.
In an interview with the Financial Times on the eve of his campaign's
official launch later today, the favourite to succeed the late John Smith
underlined his commitment to continue modernising the party.
But mindful of the need to win support among trade unions and constituency
activists, Mr Blair insisted that changing the party's policies did not mean
uprooting its traditional values. Labour would retain its pledges to full
employment and a minimum wage. But the party's links with the unions would
be 'based on fairness and not on favours'.
His prospectus for a programme of 'national renewal for the new millennium'
came as Mr John Prescott, the shadow employment secretary, and Mrs Margaret
Beckett, the leader, announced formally that they would join the contest.
Mr Prescott, a standard bearer for the party's traditionalists, said he
would base his campaign on a commitment to full employment as an 'essential
part of socialism'. Mrs Beckett, who like Mr Prescott will also contest the
deputy leadership, said she offered continuity and stability.
But as Mr Blair quickly gathered the overwhelming support of the shadow
cabinet, even before his appearance this morning in his Sedgefield
constituency, friends of the 41-year-old shadow home secretary were
confident of a comfortable victory.
Speaking in his constituency home Mr Blair said his ambition for Labour was
to end 15 years in which it had been a party of protest. To do that it had
to be capable of 'building a new coalition of support in the country that
reaches out beyond its traditional boundaries of support'.
Calling for an end to ideological battles over the respective roles of the
market and the state, over public and private ownership and over regulation
versus deregulation, Mr Blair said Labour must now define its own programme
social justice.
Labour would develop an economic strategy designed to extend opportunity
through enhanced education and training, a co-operative rather than coercive
industrial strategy, and a commitment to economic growth.
'The key to whether Britain succeeds in my view lies first of all in
developing individual potential through education and skills. It is
absolutely central.'
But amid concern among some of the shadow cabinet's leftwingers about the
direction of policy, Mr Blair stressed that he would continue with Mr
Smith's 'inclusive' style of leadership.
Walking a tightrope between his own strong convictions and the need to
maintain party unity, he said the commitment to build a modern set of
policies on which to fight the general election was 'not part of some desire
to open up rifts or disunity within the Labour party'. Nor did his belief in
the need for a 'dynamic market economy' represent a move to fight the
Conservatives on their own ground. Instead, Labour would show itself as the
only party willing to use the 'power of society' to enhance opportunity for
ordinary citizens.
Mr Blair explicitly rejected the idea of any electoral pact with Mr Paddy
Ashdown's Liberal Democrats. He said he would maintain Mr Smith's policy of
offering the voters a referendum on proportional representation.

FT  11 JUN 94 / P&amp;G moves to avoid veto on takeover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES and LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Procter &amp; Gamble, the large US consumer goods manufacturer, is understood to
have made a last-minute offer to modify its controversial proposed takeover
of a leading German maker of feminine hygiene products, in an effort to win
Brussels' approval of the deal.
The offer is believed to have been made yesterday, soon after Mr Karel Van
Miert, the European competition commissioner, had won broad agreement from
senior advisers to his fellow commissioners that the takeover should be
blocked as anti-competitive.
Though the offer is thought to go some way to meet Mr Van Miert's main
objections to the deal, he is still expected to argue that it should be
prohibited in its original form when the full 17-member commission meets on
Wednesday. That would not prevent P&amp;G from filing a fresh application asking
Brussels to approve the takeover of Vereinigte Papierwerke Schickedanz, in
modified form.
Though the exact terms of P&amp;G's offer are not known, Brussels is understood
to have insisted that the deal could not go ahead unless the US company
agreed to divest several of Schickedanz's main German sanitary towel brands.
The shift in P&amp;G's tactics coincides with signs that Mr Van Miert plans to
enforce competition rules more rigorously in other areas. He is expected
soon to propose heavy fines on Europe's leading manufacturers of carton
board and cement for alleged price-fixing.
However, the commissioner is believed to be taking a more cautious line in
investigating the French government's plan to rescue Credit Lyonnais, the
troubled state-owned bank, by injecting FFr4.9bn (Pounds 570m) of capital
and writing off FFr40bn of bad debts.
Mr Van Miert is expected to set up a panel of eminent bankers to advise him
on the case - an unprecedented step in an EU competition inquiry.
If the P&amp;G takeover of Schickedanz were prohibited, it would be only the
second deal which the Commission has blocked since it was given increased
powers to vet large mergers more than two-and-a-half years ago.
The earlier veto, of the planned takeover of De Havilland, the Canadian
aircraft manufacturer, by Aerospatiale of France and Alenia of Italy,
provoked a storm of protest in Paris and Rome.
Brussels competition authorities have objected that the P&amp;G deal would give
the US company more than half the German market for women's sanitary towels
and a dominant position in the EU overall. P&amp;G's leading competitors also
oppose the takeover.
However, P&amp;G disputes the Commission's market share figures. The company's
supporters, said to include German federal and state ministers, have argued
that jobs could be lost if the deal does not go ahead.
The Commission investigation into carton board covers all the main EU
producers and was launched in 1991, after the British Printing Industries
Federation complained of co-ordinated price rises across Europe.
The cement case is one of the most important cartel investigations on
Brussels' books and centres on alleged price-fixing involving 77 producers
and industry associations.

FT  11 JUN 94 / CU poised to buy French insurer for Pounds 1.46bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER and DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Commercial Union, the UK's largest insurance company, announced yesterday
that it was at an advanced stage of negotiations for the FFr12.5bn (Pounds
1.46bn) acquisition of Groupe Victoire, one of France's largest insurance
companies.
Compagnie de Suez, the French financial group that owns Victoire, agreed to
enter into exclusive talks with Commercial Union after Italy's Generali
announced on Thursday it was withdrawing its interest.
Mr Gerard Worms, president of Suez, said the sale of Victoire would bring
his group FFr10bn in cash, although it would have to book a FFr1bn loss. He
called the sale 'a big relief' because it would conclude more than three
years of restructuring for the financial group.
Although the deal was not yet finally completed, Mr Worms said the
commitment by Suez and CU to conclude it was 'total'. The deal, one of the
biggest ever in the industry, marks an important stage in the
rationalisation of the insurance market, the pace of which is expected to
increase as a result of liberalisation.
European Union member states must implement so-called framework directives
by July 1. Among other things, the new rules will abolish the system of
minimum prices that still operates in some parts of the market.
Mr John Carter, CU chief executive, who said his company had first looked at
Victoire six years ago, said: 'We believe that the French insurance market
offers growth opportunities in life and pensions products.'
Mr Carter said the deal would further increase the percentage of CU's
revenues earned from life insurance to 40 per cent, increasing the quality
of its earnings.
Abeille Vie, Victoire's life insurance subsidiary, is the sixth largest life
insurer in France.
At the same time, Mr Carter said, the deal increases CU's 'position as a
major European insurer with an important spread of international business.'
If the acquisition goes ahead later this year as expected, premium income
from CU's operations in continental Europe will increase to about half its
total premiums.
CU intends to finance the deal through a mixture of cash, debt and new
capital. The group said new equity would amount to about Pounds 500m. Of
that amount, Pounds 70m will be issued to Suez, while Societe Generale, the
French bank, which owns 3 per cent of CU's issued share capital, has agreed
in principle to increase its stake to as much as 6 per cent.
CU itself has had a stake in Societe Generale since the latter's
privatisation in 1987, subsequently raised to 4 per cent.
Last autumn Suez sold its German insurance subsidiary, Colonia, and some
other overseas interests to France's Union des Assurances de Paris, the
continent's second biggest group, in a deal worth more than Fr11bn.

FT  11 JUN 94 / Grand Met chief awarded life peerage in honours list
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Allen Sheppard, the chairman of Grand Metropolitan, and Lord Owen, one
of the principal peace brokers in the former Yugoslavia, are among the most
prominent figures from industry and politics to receive awards in the
Queen's birthday honours list, announced today.
Sir Allen, who has transformed his organisation from a hotels and brewing
group into one of the leading food, wines and spirits companies in the
world, is one of only three life peers created in today's list.
He heads a group of city figures who are honoured, including Mr Brian
Pitman, the chief executive of Lloyds Bank, and Mr Robert Evans, the former
chairman of British Gas, both of whom are knighted.
Lord Owen, the former British foreign secretary, is made a Companion of
Honour after his efforts to bring peace to Bosnia. Among other political
figures to receive awards are Sir Christopher Prout, the leader of the
Conservatives in the European parliament, and Mr Richard Needham, the trade
minister, both of whom become privy councillors.
There are knighthoods for three Tory MPs: Mr Andrew Bowden, MP for Brighton
Kemptown, Mr Kenneth Carlisle, MP for Lincoln, and Mr John Gorst, MP for
Hendon North.
Among the leading public servants who are knighted are Mr Paul Condon, the
Metropolitan Police Commissioner, and Professor William Stewart, the
government's chief scientific adviser, who was one of the main drafters of
the government's recent white paper on science policy. There is a
knighthood, too, for Professor David Tweedie, the chairman of the
accountancy standards board, who has pushed through major changes in the
profession.
There will be particular interest in the knighthood for Mr Paul Newall, the
Lord Mayor of London. The government caused a minor storm in the City last
autumn by not knighting him when he was appointed to the post, as is
traditional.
Figures from the academic world are also well represented.
Professor Sir David Phillips, a leading biophysicist, is another of the life
peers created in the list. The third - after Sir Allen Sheppard - is Sir
Randolph Quirk, one of the world's leading English literature professors.
Professor Laurence Martin, director of the Royal Institute of International
Affairs, is knighted.
Sir Alec Guinness, the actor, becomes a Companion of Honour. Miss Diana
Rigg, the actress, becomes a dame.
In the world of sport, Mr Bobby Charlton, the former Manchester United and
England footballer, is knighted. Among cricketers, Mr Viv Richards, the
former West Indies captain, becomes an OBE.
Today's list marks the latest attempt by the prime minister to broaden the
range of people in public life who receive honours. Around a third of those
in today's 1,000-strong list are voluntary and charitable workers, and there
are around 300 women.

FT  11 JUN 94 / Threat of train strike deepens as offer refused
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The threat of a 24-hour strike by railway signalmen next Wednesday deepened
last night after it emerged that their union negotiators had rejected a 5.7
per cent pay offer from Railtrack designed to resolve the conflict.
The RMT transport union said the company's proposal was 'not nearly enough'
to satisfy the grievances of the signalmen, who are demanding an 11 per cent
interim wage increase as a condition for entering into talks with Railtrack
over the restructuring of their pay system.
Last night Railtrack denied that it had made any offer to the union.
The RMT said it had spent three days of 'exhaustive negotiations' this week
to try to avert a strike. 'We have made ourselves available to settle the
dispute as quickly as possible,' the union added. 'We have just been told
that the Railtrack board cannot make their minds up on what to offer staff.
They are at sixes and sevens.'
Further talks between the two sides are expected on Monday, but the RMT
warned last night that this was leaving little time to resolve the
signalmen's grievances. Mr Jimmy Knapp, RMT general secretary, said
yesterday: 'The claim has been outstanding for seven years. 'If our members
are forced to take strike action on Wednesday the fault lies with
Railtrack.'
Railtrack said that the board had to be called in from all over Britain and
there was no possibility of convening a meeting before Monday.

<TEXT>
Trans World Airlines, the US carrier that has run into a series of setbacks
since emerging from bankruptcy last November, suffered another blow
yesterday when its chief financial officer unexpectedly quit.
Mr Richard Shuyler is the fourth top executive to have left the carrier this
year. In the last few months the company has also lost a chairman, a
vice-chairman and a senior vice-president.
TWA said Mr Shuyler had accepted a similar position at Atlas Air, a cargo
airline based in Golden, Colorado. His departure leaves the company without
a chief financial officer because he left without waiting for a successor to
be appointed.
The latest development comes soon after the launch of a cost-cutting
programme at TWA aimed at offsetting a decline in revenues.
Mr Shuyler, who was in charge of the programme, had asked all departments to
cut their budgets by 10 per cent in an effort to cut Dollars 100m from
costs. The plan is expected to involve heavy job cuts  - a difficult
proposition to sell to employees since they own 45 per cent of the company's
shares.

FT  10 JUN 94 / International Company News: Hollinger boosts quarterly
payout
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Hollinger, the international publishing group controlled by Mr Conrad Black,
has raised its quarterly dividend by 50 per cent and presented a confident
view of future prospects, especially in North America.
The dividend increase, from 10 cents to 15 cents a share, was accompanied by
a prediction from Mr Black yesterday that 1994 will be a year 'of
unprecedented profit and cash flow'.
Hollinger's interests include 57 per cent of the UK Telegraph group, which
in turn owns 25 per cent of Australia's John Fairfax Holdings. It also has a
minority stake in Southam, Canada's biggest newspaper group, and earlier
this year bought the Chicago-Sun Times.
Mr Black told the annual meeting in Toronto that he expects Hollinger's
North American papers (excluding Southam) to lift earnings to CDollars 80m
(USDollars 57.9m) this year, before depreciation and taxes but after
interest, from just under CDollars 50m in 1993.
He predicted that profits of American Publishing, Hollinger's US subsidiary,
would exceed those of the Telegraph within the next three years.
Mr Black said the Sun-Times, Chicago's second-largest daily, was 'fairly
close' to a decision on new technology to replace its ageing printing
facilities. Hollinger has already trimmed the Sun-Times' payroll.
Mr Black added that the circulations of the UK Daily Telegraph and Sunday
Telegraph were 'quite satisfactory' at present, in spite of cut-price
competition from The Times.
But he said the Telegraph would consider 'remedial action' if The Times'
circulation rose to more than half that of the Telegraph, presently just
over 1m copies a day.
'We will not tolerate any challenge to the Telegraph's market supremacy,' he
said.

FT  10 JUN 94 / International Company News: Appointment to top job at Merck
surprises industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Merck, the biggest drugs company in the US, yesterday surprised the
pharmaceuticals industry by naming the head of a New Jersey-based medical
devices company as its next president, chief executive and chairman.
Mr Raymond Gilmartin, 53, is head of Becton Dickinson, which makes a wide
range of medical products, including syringes, intravenous catheters and
blood collecting equipment, and which had sales last year of Dollars 2.5bn.
Merck has sales of Dollars 10bn, with such big-selling products as Vasotec,
a treatment for hypertension, Mevacor, a cholesterol-lowering agent, and
Pepcid, an anti-ulcer drug.
The announcement comes after a year of upheaval in which three potential
candidates for the top job at Merck have left the company.
An appointment from outside had been expected, but the announcement, after
the stock market had closed, came as a surprise. 'This will clearly be a
substantial surprise, and a continuation of the trend of bringing in
outsiders to shake up the company,' said Mr Viren Mehta, an industry
analyst.
Mr Gilmartin, who has been chief executive of Becton Dickinson since 1989,
will take over as Merck's president and chief executive next Thursday, and
will become chairman on November 1.
He succeeds Mr Roy Vagelos, one of the pharmaceuticals industry's most
widely-respected executives, who reaches the company's retirement age of 65
in November.
Like other big drugs companies, Merck is facing pressure from managed care
organisations, which have forced pharmaceuticals companies to offer big
discounts.
Mr Gilmartin said Merck 'will remain dedicated to its basic mission of
discovering, developing and marketing innovative and cost-effective
medicines'.
Other executives once seen as possible successors to Mr Vagelos and who have
left the company in the past year have been Mr Martin Wygod, formerly head
of Medco, a drugs distribution company bought by Merck for Dollars 6.6bn
last year; Mr John Zabriskie, one of four executive vice-presidents; and Mr
Richard Markham, who left last summer after only seven months as company
president.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Lyonnaise des Eaux, the French utilities and construction group, will show a
'significant' rise in profits from last year's modest FFr804m (Dollars
141m), Mr Jerome Monod, president, forecast yesterday.
Irrespective of the slight recovery in the French economy this year, Mr
Monod told shareholders the group's aim was to increase its business abroad
to 60 per cent of its turnover in the next five years, from 42 per cent.
The company hopes to win the contract for France's third mobile phone
network, in spite of competition from two rival consortia.
Havas, the French media group, said it will invest FFr765m to raise its
stake in Compagnie Luxembourgeoise de Telediffusion (CLT), the Luxembourg
broadcaster, to 20.4 per cent from 15.9 per cent, under a new deal with
Groupe Bruxelles Lambert (GBL), Reuter adds from Paris.
Belgian holding companies GBL, Electrafina, and Havas have reshuffled their
interest in Audiofina, the media holding company that controls CLT, GBL said
earlier.
A new company, notionally called Newco, 60 per cent controlled by GBL and
Electrafina, and 40 per cent by Havas, will now group their stakes in
Audiofina.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The board of World Fluids Holdings, the specialist chemicals and additives
manufacturer, yesterday warned that trading for the first four months of the
current year had been disappointing and well below expectations.
The company pointed out, however, that this was in common with most
companies operating in the sector, where oil prices affected their results.
The statement was in response to a recent sharp fall in the shares, which
earlier this year touched 40p, but yesterday stood at 18p.

FT  10 JUN 94 / Visitors passport may be scrapped
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The British visitors passport may disappear as a result of a review of its
future being conducted by the government, Alan Pike writes.
The review has been prompted by warnings from the Spanish government that it
intends to cease recognising Britain's one-year travel document. No date for
the Spanish action has yet been announced - but British officials believe it
could take effect at the end of next year.
This suggests that a decision on whether to withdraw the British visitors
passport is likely to be taken before the end of this year.
The government is seeking the views of the travel trade and a range of other
interested groups as part of the review, which will be completed by the end
of the summer.
Ministers are likely to begin considering whether the British visitors
passport should be withdrawn, and other possible implications for the
issuing of passports, in the autumn.

FT  10 JUN 94 / Second place equals victory for Labour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the result of the Eastleigh by-election was read out this morning, the
cheer from Labour supporters was so big that it was easy to forget they had
only come second. The Liberal Democrats had taken the seat with a 20 per
cent swing from the Tories - significantly lower than the last two
by-elections, but a comfortable win nonetheless.
But for Labour, its credibility as an outlet for disillusioned Tory voters
in the south had been on the line. By achieving its own target - of coming a
strong second - it succeeded in showing that it could win votes in the south
and prevent itself from being squeezed by the Liberal Democrats.
The Liberal Democrats pointed to an eve-of-poll leaflet distributed by
Labour predicting that it would win Eastleigh by 6,000 votes. But no one,
least of all Labour's own officials, believed the contest was between the
two opposition parties. Both the Conservatives and Labour had privately
conceded victory to the Liberal Democrats long ago.
Labour, which has never fought so hard for a seat it had no hope of winning,
managed to push the Tories into third place. Miss Marilyn Birks, Labour
candidate, said last night she had succeeded in showing disillusioned Tories
in the south that Labour was a realistic alternative.
She said: 'This by-election has been a referendum on the Tory government and
the voters have given them a clear message that their policies have failed.'
Mr Tony Blair, favourite for the Labour leadership, had been vindicated in
showing that Labour had become sufficiently attractive to win votes in the
south of England. Labour had taken the risk in deciding not to 'relinquish'
its votes for Liberal Democrats - as it grandly did in Newbury - and the
gamble had paid off.
But Labour was helped by a turnout that was significantly lower than usual.
Only 58.9 per cent turned out, compared with 83 per cent in the last
election. Mr David Willets, the Conservative MP minding the Tory candidate,
Mr Steven Reid, said it was clear that many Tory voters had stayed at home
while the majority of disillusioned Conservatives had defected to the
Liberal Democrats. He said: 'The fight to take this seat back at the next
general election starts on Monday.'
Mr Willets consoled himself with the fact that those who abstained were
supporters of the government. 'They'll come out again at the next election,'
he said.
Mr David Chidgey, Liberal Democrat candidate, said Liberal Democrats knew
better than most that there were no prizes for coming second. He said he was
'delighted' with his majority of more than 9,000, which was significantly
larger than the Liberal Democrats had been expecting.
He added: 'This is a clear message to the prime minister - change your
policies or change your job.'
Liberal Democrats also pointed out that Labour had fought the campaign to
win and had lost. As one Liberal official said: 'You have to go back to 1962
to find a Labour gain in the south of England (when Dorset South was taken
by the official opposition).'
While the two opposition parties were pleased with their respective results,
the only obvious losers were the Conservatives.

FT  10 JUN 94 / London results grim for Major
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The by-election results in the four Labour-held seats were less spectacular
than the crushing Conservative defeat in Eastleigh. But they still represent
very bad news for Mr John Major.
On the basis of the 1992 general election results, the Conservatives started
second in all four seats - Bradford South in West Yorkshire, and the three
east London seats of Barking, Dagenham and Newham North East.
By the end of counting early this morning, they had finished a humiliating
third in Bradford South and Barking, and a poor second in Dagenham and
Newham, where they were helped by the last-minute defection to Labour of
Liberal Democrat Mr Alec Kellaway.
Labour's vote rose strongly in all four seats - by 20 per cent in Dagenham,
17 per cent in Newham, 22 per cent in Barking and 8 per cent in Bradford.
The Conservatives were down 26 per cent, 7 per cent, 21 per cent and 21 per
cent respectively.
Sir Norman Fowler, Tory party chairman, admitted that the results were 'very
disappointing', but claimed that the impact of the defeat would be muted by
an 'amazingly low' turnout in all four constituencies. 'By any analysis, a
lot of people are simply staying away and not voting,' he said on BBC
television. 'That gives us the opportunity to recover and regain our
support.'
Nevertheless, the polling is deeply depressing for the Conservatives, who
had pinned their hopes of remaining a credible force in Labour seats on
coming second in all four seats. Labour hailed the results as a signal that
the government's popularity had fallen too far for the Tories to have much
hope of recovering ground in London before the next general election.
Mr Frank Dobson, shadow minister for London, said the east London results
were 'stunningly good' and 'very disturbing for the government'. Mr Nick
Raynsford, Labour campaign organiser for London, said the results reinforced
Labour's standing as the biggest party in the capital.
The results were mixed for the Liberal Democrats, who finished second in
Bradford South with 24 per cent of the vote, up 10 per cent on the general
election; and in Barking, with 12 per cent, down from 14.5 per cent.
The poor result in Newham - where the party polled just 821 votes - was
expected because of the embarrassment and confusion caused by the defection
of Mr Kellaway. But Liberal Democrat strategists will be disappointed not to
have done better in Dagenham, where their share of the vote fell by 3
percentage points to 8.4 per cent.
The feared revival of the extreme right in London did not materialise. The
British National Party came fourth in Dagenham, but won only 1,511 votes in
spite of pouring in resources for the campaign. The National Front won only
551 votes in Barking.
Ms Judith Church, the victor in Dagenham, said the extreme right had been
'firmly' rejected. 'This is a wonderful defeat for them and a wonderful
victory for us,' she said.

FT  10 JUN 94 / Research funding geared to commerce
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
University research which is directly relevant to commerce and industry is
to receive more funding, under government plans published yesterday.
The quangos which control funding for universities - the higher education
funding councils for England, Scotland and Wales and the Department of
Education for Northern Ireland - said they wanted to address complaints by
employers that funding was skewed towards basic or academic research. They
also intend to implement proposals to improve technology foresight published
in last year's science white paper.
The new rules will be applied to the university research assessment exercise
which starts in 1996. The judgments it then makes on the quality of research
will determine research funding from 1997 onwards.
Total government research funding for that year has not yet been decided,
but this year's budget from the Department for Education, for English
universities alone, was Pounds 618m.
Mr Bahram Bekhradnia, head of policy for the Higher Education Funding
Council for England, said the council hoped to appoint industrialists to the
panels which will judge the university departments. They would work jointly
with the leading academics who now control funding.
Requirements that departments submit only published academic research will
be dropped. Now patents, and the results of industrial research for
companies, will be judged on the same basis.
This means a university doing only industrial research could still attract a
top allocation of research funding if the research is of high quality.
The Scottish funding council has the power to steer extra funds to specific
subjects if they are important to the local economy. It is still discussing
whether to do so.

Yemen's rival armies made a fresh ceasefire attempt yesterday but southern
leaders accused northern forces of breaking their own self-declared truce
within hours of its taking effect, Reuter reports from Aden. After a day of
northern artillery fire on the southern stronghold of Aden, Sanaa television
reported northern President Ali Abdullah Saleh had ordered his forces to
observe a ceasefire from 6 pm yesterday. Southern Yemen, which broke away
from a four-year union with the north on May 21, agreed to the truce but
later said Mr Saleh's troops had launched a surprise attack including heavy
artillery bombardments of its forces.

FT  10 JUN 94 / Lisbon 'fastest growing city'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lisbon is set to be the fastest-growing European city in the next four
years, closely followed by Dublin, Hamburg, Athens and Lille, according to
new UK economic study.
The report, by Cambridge Econometrics, predicts Stuttgart will see the
slowest rate of economic growth. Stuttgart's economy is predicted to expand
by only 1.1 per cent a year, while Lisbon is expected to grow by 3.6 per
cent a year. London will grow 2.3 per cent a year, with Paris' growth rate
of 1.8 per cent.

FT  10 JUN 94 / Danes show support for anti-Europeans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign and Political Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Danish anti-European parties attracted some of the strongest support in
polling among the four European Union countries where elections were held
yesterday for an expanded European parliament.
However, according to one poll, the strongly pro-union Liberal party, led by
Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, the former foreign minister, stood to add one seat
to win four of Denmark's 16 seats.
Exit polls indicated that Denmark's two anti-European parties, which are not
represented in the country's national parliament, increased their share of
the vote to about 25 per cent from 18.9 per cent at the last election in
1989. But they were not expected to add to their four seats in the last
parliament.
The Social Democratic party, which dominates the present government
coalition, was expected to lose one of its four seats. Its share of the vote
appeared to have fallen to about 15 per cent from 23.3 per cent. Mr Poul
Nyrup Rasmussen, the prime minister, said it was 'a clearly disappointing
result'.
The pro-union Centre Democratic party also appeared likely to have lost both
its seats, with its share of the vote falling from 7.9 per cent to about 1
per cent.
The polls indicated a turnout of 52 per cent in Denmark, up from 46.2 per
cent. But turnout appeared to have fallen in the UK and the Netherlands
while in Ireland, the fourth country where voting took place, it was
estimated at between 40 per cent and 50 per cent of the 2.6m voters. This
compared with 48 per cent in 1989.
Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian prime minister who is a possible successor
to Mr Jacques Delors as European Commission president, said he was
distressed by the low turnout.
The elections appeared to have strengthened the position of the Dutch
Christian Democrat party, which emerged as the largest party in the
Netherlands, reclaiming the position it lost in national elections last
month. Preliminary forecasts reported by Dutch television last night showed
that the Christian Democrats stood to win 11 seats in the European
parliament, three seats ahead of Labour, which is now the largest party in
the national parliament. For the Christian Democrats, the results would mean
a gain of one seat in the European parliament, with Labour unchanged.
Elections for the expanded 567-seat parliament will take place in the other
eight EU countries on Sunday.

FT  10 JUN 94 / Tories suffer crushing defeat: Major faces massive Euro-poll
losses as Lib Dems triumph in Eastleigh
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, KEVIN BROWN and ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major's government was facing a mid-term electoral catastrophe early
this morning after crashing to a humiliating third-place defeat at the hands
of the Liberal Democrats in the Eastleigh by-election.
The loss of the once-safe seat and a massive anti-government swing in four
other by-elections raised the prospect of a performance in the European
elections worse than even the Conservatives' most dire expectations.
Initial projections raised the question whether the Tory representation in
the Strasbourg assembly would fall from the present 32 seats to just a
handful, an outcome which would re-ignite the threat to Mr Major's
leadership. Labour and the Liberal Democrats, which treated the elections as
a referendum on the prime minister's record, were both anticipating
spectactular gains.
As Sir Norman Fowler, the Tory party chairman, sought to dismiss suggestions
that Mr Major's premiership will be plunged into fresh crisis, Mr Paddy
Ashdown's Liberal Democrats overturned a Tory majority in Eastleigh of more
than 17,000 at the 1992 general election.
Completing a hat-trick of by-election victories over the past year, Mr David
Chidgey, the Liberal Democrat candidate secured a majority of 9,239 in the
poll caused by the death earlier this year of Mr Stephen Milligan. The swing
against the Conservatives was 21.5 per cent.
Mr Stephen Reid, the Conservative candidate, was forced into a humiliating
third place in a previously safe Tory seat after a vigorous campaign by
Labour's Mrs Marilyn Birks.
A massive protest vote against the government across the country was
underlined by a similar collapse in the Conservative vote in four other
by-elections in which Labour held on to previously safe seats.
In Bradford South and Barking, a massive 21 per cent anti-government swing
forced the Conservatives into third place behind the Liberal Democrats.
Labour won comfortably also in Newham North East and Dagenham. But in all
four seats there were extremely low turnouts.
Mr David Butler, a leading psephologist and fellow of Nuffield College
Oxford, said the by-election results were 'as devastating as they could be'.
The Conservative vote was on average 23 per cent down on the 1992 general
election.
If replicated in the European elections when the results are announced on
Sunday evening, the Eastleigh swing from the Conservatives to the Liberal
Democrats was enough for them to win all the Strasbourg seats where they are
the main challenger to the Conservatives. The swing from the Conservatives
to Labour in the four other by-elections would guarantee a Labour win in
every Conservative euro-seat where they are the main challenger.
A low turnout in the European poll suggested that core Conservative voters
had ignored last minute pleas from the prime minister to support his
opposition to a centralised federal Europe. Early indications were that less
than 40 per cent of the electorate had turned out. Sir Norman acknowledged
early this morning that the government was heading for a serious defeat but
insisted that Mr Major's position was secure.
The prime minister, who took a high-profile personal role in the campaign,
has repeatedly stressed he will fight any challenge to his leadership. But
the return to Westminster early next week of Tory MPs is certain to fuel
speculation about a challenge to the prime minister in the autumn.
Exit surveys indicated that Conservative support in some areas had
collapsed. A straw poll in Norfolk by the Eastern Daily Press suggested a 19
percentage points swing from the Tories to Labour.
A straw poll in four West of England seats for Westcountry Television
suggested a swing of about 18 points from the Conservatives to the two
opposition parties. About two-thirds of the extra votes were going to the
Liberal Democrats. However, election analysts warned that the polls were not
based on scientific samples.
The Conservatives had hoped that a late swing to the party could allow it to
hold up to 20 seats. However the latest opinion poll, by Mori for The Times,
indicated that the party could be left with as few as four seats. The poll
gave the Conservatives 23 per cent of the vote, compared with 51 per cent
for Labour, and 20 per cent for the Liberal Democrats.

FT  10 JUN 94 / PepsiCo shares drop9% over price war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in PepsiCo, US maker of the soft drink Pepsi-Cola, lost 9 per cent of
their value by the close of trade yesterday, after the company shocked Wall
Street with news that a cola price war had broken out in its domestic
market.
PepsiCo fell Dollars 3 1/4 to close at Dollars 31 1/2 while Coca-Cola
dropped Dollars  7/8 to finish at Dollars 40 3/4 .
PepsiCo warned that second-quarter profits would be flat because of the
inroads being made into the US cola market by Cott, the fast-growing
Canadian maker of low-cost, store-branded foods and drinks.
Cott recently sparked a row in the UK by supplying J. Sainsbury, the
country's biggest retailer, with a store-branded cola that looks and tastes
similar to Coca-Cola but sells at roughly half the price. Coca-Cola accused
Sainsbury of trying to pass off Cott's product as 'the real thing'.
PepsiCo's announcement left investors worried because it called to mind last
year's 'Marlboro Friday', when Philip Morris, US manufacturer of Marlboro
cigarettes, slashed prices in response to cut-price competition.
The development also reinforced worries on Wall Street about the true worth
of brands at a time when value-conscious consumers seem inclined to switch
away from famous-name products if they feel they can get the same quality at
a lower price.
Cott is the largest supplier of store-branded soft drinks in North America.
The company has begun to spread outside North America to South Africa and
Australia, and signed an agreement with Cadbury Schweppes of the UK that
should allow it to distribute its products throughout Europe.

FT  10 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Lloyds falters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, CHRISTINE BUCKLEY, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CLARE
GASCOIGNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The setback to Lloyds Bank's move to merge with Cheltenham and Gloucester
Building Society, announced after the market had closed on Wednesday, saw
Lloyds Bank shares marked down sharply at the outset before staging a strong
rally.
The shares went to 553p at the start of trading as dealers sought to head
off any attempted selling by institutions. Little pressure developed at that
level, however, and the stock quickly recovered its poise, closing at 566p
for a net fall of only 5. Turnover was a heavy 9.7m shares.
Bank analysts saw the blocking of the merger as only temporary. 'It is a
case of spot the cleverest way of getting round a little local difficulty,'
said one specialist.
Final results from British Land helped the shares move forward as the group
unveiled a net asset value (nav) of 423p, well ahead of market forecasts.
Profits at Pounds 53.9m (against Pounds 27.2m a year ago) were also higher
than forecast.
Goldman Sachs has pencilled in an nav of 475p, up 23p, for the current year,
with 522p expected for 1996. The shares added 5 at 389p against a weak
property sector.
There was more big demand for Standard Chartered after recent broker
recommendations and the shares added 6 at 277p with turnover reaching 7.9m.
Switching from National Westminster to Barclays saw the latter edge up to
550p and the former slip 12 to 461p.
The two classes of HSBC stock, London registered and Hong Kong registered,
were the market's most heavily traded shares as the shares representing the
enhanced scrip dividend were put through the market, the HK shares at 726
1/2 p and the London stock at 702p. HSBC London shares lost 7 at 715p with
13m traded, and the HK stock was 8 lower at 734p on turnover of 16m.
CE Heath was the latest in a series of dismally performing insurance
brokers, plunging 24 to 339p after the group said it would include an
exceptional charge of around Pounds 22m as the group's Australian subsidiary
lost a court case involving the State of Victoria's Accident Compensation
Commission.
Pharmaceutical issues were wanted after a buy note from Wertheim Schroder on
Glaxo, up 4 1/2 to 548 1/2 p. Mr Jonathan Gelles said he believed the stock
had been oversold on the prospect of commercial threat to Zantac, its
anti-ulcer drug.
He also cited anti-asthmatic, migraine, and steroidal hay fever drugs as
potential areas for growth.
Renewed comment on prospects of a demerger at Thorn EMI boosted the shares,
which closed 11 up at 1089p. Bearish tales on Ladbroke, mainly concerning
difficulties in breaking into the US casino market, undermined the stock,
but a late rally kept the damage to a penny fall at 159p.
There was talk of big institutional buying accompanying Kwik Save's swift
rise of 15 to 569p.
Sales at clothes retailer Etam in the current year to end-January 1995 were
continuing to run ahead of levels a year ago, shareholders were told at
yesterday's agm. The shares put on 5 at 265p. At its agm, Austin Reed
shareholders heard sales were 14 per cent above the same period a year ago.
The stock gained 3 at 226p.
Switching in a directionless market was blamed by some analysts in the
transport sector for a tumble in BAA shares and a rise in British Airways.
'There is some switching going on to generate business and the feeling is
that there is more chance of good news in British Airways since we have had
the results from BAA,' commented one analyst.
The phasing out of EU subsidies on national airlines and an airlines
presentation at Kleinwort Benson also helped to trigger some activity in the
stocks. BAA fell 12 to 929p while British Airways appreciated 7 to 397p.
Over-optimistic views ahead of the results were blamed by one analyst for a
drop in the shares of Johnson Matthey after the company delivered its
figures. The stock finished 28 down at 558p, albeit in very thin volume.
A bullish agm statement from media agency Saatchi &amp; Saatchi pushed the
shares 8 ahead to 141p, the market responding to chief executive Mr Charles
Scott's comments that revenues would be higher than budgeted.
Chubb Security shares suffered a fall of nearly 7 per cent as they slid 25
to 335p after results came in below some analysts' forecasts.
Funeral group Great Southern jumped 133 to 608p after an Pounds 87.4m bid
worth 600p a share.
Stock market debuts from Brewin Dolphin and Spargo saw the stockbroking
group steady at the 150p placing price, while the computer software
consultancy went to a 13p premium at 108p.

FT  10 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Victoire bid talk hits CU
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, CHRISTINE BUCKLEY, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CLARE
GASCOIGNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The recent strong performance by Commercial Union, the insurance group, was
stopped in its tracks by growing speculation that the company is about to
launch a full or partial bid for Groupe Victoire, the insurance company
owned by Companie de Suez, the French financial services company.
The Victoire bid stories have been circulating in London and throughout
European financial centres for some time, but up until now have largely been
discounted by UK insurance analysts. CU is the UK's largest composite
insurer, measured by market capital-isation.
Suez chairman Mr Gerard Worms said on French television on Wednesday evening
that a decision on Victoire's future would be announced at Suez's
shareholders meeting on June 15. Suez is believed to have received two bids
for Victoire, with Italy's Generali said to have been one bidder and CU
strongly rumoured as the other. Yesterday, Generali acknowledged that it had
bid for Victoire but said it had withdrawn the offer.
Insurance specialists said that any move by CU for Victoire, which would
cost in excess of Pounds 1.2bn, would almost certainly have to be
accompanied by a fund-raising move, either via a straight rights offer or
convertible bond issue. A move to buy Victoire's life operations would cost
in the region of Pounds 600m.
There were other reasons behind the weakness in CU. NatWest Securities
published a note describing the stock as 'overvalued', while the shares
figured prominently in a big trading programme weighted on the sell side. At
the close CU shares were 23 weaker at 538p.

FT  10 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Political factors overshadow nervous
session - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The sharper political focus as voting in both national by-elections and the
elections for the European parliament took place in the UK yesterday left
share prices to give ground in cautious trading. Falls in government bonds,
reflecting market doubts over prospects for Conservative candidates in the
UK, also served to unsettle equities.
The FT-SE 100 Index ended 9.3 down at 3,028.9, just above the lowest level
of an erratic trading session. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index fared a little
better, shedding only 1.5 to 3,599.3, largely because second line issues
were somewhat neglected.
There was some disappointment at the apparent unwillingness of the big
institutions to maintain the buying pressure of the previous session.
However, Seaq volume was nearly 16 per cent higher. On Wednesday retail
value jumped to Pounds 1.26bn, compared with Pounds 936m and Pounds 764m
respectively in the two preceding trading sessions, implying a welcome
return to more normal trading levels.
Turnover was boosted yesterday by a large trading programme at midsession,
weighted to the sell side and comprising a wide range of Footsie and Mid 250
stocks. Hanson, Tesco, Glaxo, British Steel, British Gas and BAT Industries
were prominent in the programme list. Two more smaller programmes were also
identified.
Market strategists remained fairly optimistic, pointing to the sharp rise in
UK industrial output announced this week. But, with voting in the European
elections continuing over the weekend in some Continental countries, the
markets expect to remain overshadowed for some days.
Investors were also looking ahead to next week when markets face a busier
calendar of economic data on both sides of the Atlantic.
Equities attempted in early dealings to extend the recovery of the previous
day but were checked by a general malaise in bond markets across Europe,
although the Bundesbank decision to leave rates unchanged was no surprise. A
gain of 6 Footsie points was soon reversed, and at the day's low of 3,025.6
the index was more than 12 points down.
London was unsettled at the end of trading by a hesitant start on Wall
Street, where the Dow showed a dip of nearly 3 points as the UK markets
closed. Some caution was expressed ahead of the announcement, expected
today, of the latest producer price index in the US. On the whole, however,
markets hope that Federal Reserve credit policy will remain benign, for the
time being at least.
Trading statements from leading British companies were generally helpful for
market sentiment. PowerGen, the electricity generator, pleased the market
and the recent buyers of the shares by sharply increasing the dividend
payout, thus underlining the yield attractions which have kept the sector in
the centre of the stage during the recent market weakness. Also delivering
good dividend news was Johnson Matthey, the precious metals group.
The market seemed to take an optimistic view of the High Court ruling on
Lloyds Bank's bid for Cheltenham and Gloucester Building Society, a move
which could have widespread implications for the whole of the UK financial
sector. The Lloyds Bank share price reacted only mildly, implying market
belief that the Pounds 1.8bn bid will be reshaped so as to secure legal and
regulatory acceptance.

FT  10 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Uncertainty dogged stock index futures, with contrary views on market
direction pulling against each other and stifling activity, Christine
Buckley writes.
The market struggled to develop a unified outlook on what one derivatives
expert described as a very difficult day. Some traders were determined to
forecast a rise in equity derivatives, while others remained convinced that
the rally was definitely at an end.
The June contract on the FT-SE 100 was further stymied by having only a few
more working days until expiry. Investors have been steadily moving to roll
over their positions into the September future.
June again trailed the cash market for most of the day, although by a modest
amount. At the close it was 5 points behind at 3,022. The trading range was
tight, with the day's low at 3,017 and high at 3,039. September finished the
session at 3,036. Volume was modest at 11,464 June contracts traded and
4,342 for the September future.
Options maintained the steady level of activity of recent sessions, with
32,535 lots traded. Index options again formed about half of the day's
trade. A spread trade in Guinness helped to make it the day's most heavily
dealt stock option at 5,654 lots. Movement was from August puts to February
puts.

FT  10 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (America): US beverages hit by warning
from PepsiCo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US share prices held fairly steady in quiet trading yesterday, but investors
in beverage stocks were rattled by a profits warning issued by PepsiCo,
writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 3.69 better at 3,753.14 and the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 drifted 0.80 higher to 457.86. The Nasdaq composite
dipped 0.91 to 728.88, although technology stocks stabilised after
Wednesday's sharp fall. NYSE volume remained moderate, totalling 253m
shares.
Before the opening, most market observers were expecting a tranquil trading
session. There was no important economic news scheduled for release and the
bond market was taking a breather ahead of today's report on May producer
prices.
A shred of news was forthcoming from the Labor Department, which said
initial claims for state unemployment benefit held steady last week. But the
development was brushed aside.
However, investors were unable to ignore an announcement by PepsiCo. The big
soft drinks group said its second-quarter earnings would show no improvement
over last year's result.
After a delayed opening, the stock tumbled Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 31 1/2 .
Adding to its distress, at least two securities houses, Smith Barney and
Bear Stearns, lowered their ratings on the issue.
PepsiCo's warning carried implications for the entire beverage industry,
since it linked its flat performance to slumping prices in the US soft
drinks business.
The trend was presumed to have affected Coca-Cola, too. Its share price was
marked down Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 40 3/4 on heavy volume of some 3.5m
shares. Payment of the company's dividend yesterday contributed to the extra
activity.
Cott, a leading private label soft drinks bottler, dropped Dollars 1 1/4 to
Dollars 18 1/8 , although analysts said its aggressiveness was behind the
pricing pressures within the industry.
Snapple, which specialises in iced tea drinks, receded Dollars 1 3/4 to
Dollars 25 1/4 . It was the second consecutive day in which the former
darling of the stock market suffered heavy losses. Ironically, the reason
for the markdown was stiffer competition from Lipton, a line marketed
jointly by PepsiCo and Unilever.
The damage triggered by PepsiCo's announcement also spilled over into the
fast-food business, where soft drink sales are a mainstay.
McDonald's retreated Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 60. Its weakness was the
biggest restraint on the Dow industrials, most of which were showing modest
gains.
On a brighter note, many technology stocks steadied after fears of a
slowdown in personal computer orders had triggered a sell-off in the
previous session.
However, the industry was facing another big hurdle, with the Semiconductor
Industry Association set to release its May 'book-to-bill' ratio just after
the close. The figure is regarded as a reliable indicator of the future
performance of computer companies.
Before its release, Texas Instruments fell Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 74 7/8
and Applied Materials lost Dollars 2 to Dollars 38 3/8 .
With computer sales expected to flag, office-supply retailers were feeling
the pinch. Office Depot weakened Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 34 3/8 and Staples
Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 27 7/8 .
Canada
A further fall for the Toronto market was followed by a late-session rally
that left the TSE 300 composite index just 4.5 off on the day at 4,196.8.
The index was down 25 points at midday.
Declines led rises by 456 to 306. Volume was light at 43.5m shares. Ten of
the 14 sub-indices closed lower, led by utilities, down 1.2 per cent. The
mining group had the day's biggest rise, up 1.4 per cent.
Cineplex Odeon rose 15 cents to CDollars 4.70. The company said at its
annual meeting that it is in a 'prime position' for a possible merger or
major acquisition, but added that a deal is not imminent.
Brazil
Shares in Sao Paulo closed 3.8 per cent stronger after moderate trade,
prices having rebounded from an early profit-taking wave tied to bearish
news on the presidential race. The Bovespa index added 1,106 at 29,324.
Turnover came to Cr561.2bn (Dollars 269.5m).
Brokers said prices rallied in late trade on lingering optimism ahead of the
introduction of the new currency, the real, on July 1.
The market declined at the opening following publication of an opinion poll
by Ibope private research institute which showed that left-wing presidential
candidate Mr Luiz Inacio 'Lula' da Silva was maintaining a strong lead over
rivals with 39 per cent of the poll. Former economy minister Mr Fernando
Henrique Cardoso had 17 per cent.

FT  10 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Foreign demand sustains
Nikkei at two-year high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PATTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Growing optimism pushed share prices up strongly for a third straight day in
active trading, writes Robert Patton in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 average added 140.84 at 21,402.78, its highest close in more
than two years. Although there was heavy profit-taking, foreign investors
joined some domestic institutions in a wave of buying.
Volume was estimated at 850m shares, sharply above Wednesday's 599.3m and
the heaviest since the 950.8m that changed hands on February 1. Rises led
falls by 721 to 303, with 162 issues unchanged.
The capital-weighted Nikkei 300 finished at 311.60, up 1.75, and the Topix
index of all first section stocks gained 11.42 at 1,709.16. In London the
ISE/Nikkei 50 index firmed 4.21 to 1,414.69.
The market scraped bottom at 21,263.95 on the Nikkei 225 in the first
half-hour, but it had made the bulk of its gain by mid-morning; the
afternoon session saw heavy trading across all sectors, with individual
investors appearing on the buy side, and the day's peak of 21,455.49 was
reached shortly before the close.
Brokerage houses benefited from the return of activity that spells high
commission income. The 'Big Four' houses all gained ground, Nomura
Securities advancing Y90 to Y1,440, Yamaichi Y31 to Y990, Nikko Y40 to
Y1,440 and Daiwa Y20 to Y1,840. Smaller firms also posted strong gains. Wako
Securities added nearly 10 per cent, moving up Y120 to Y1290, and Marusan
Securities climbed Y80 to Y1,250.
Shipbuilders rose in active trading. The volume leader, Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries, moved up Y32 to Y819 in heavy foreign buying that pushed
turnover to 40.5m shares. Mitsui Engineering and Shipbuilding advanced Y13
to Y394.
The second most active stock, Oki Electric, added to its previous strong
gains, rising Y49 to Y789, a new high for the year, in volume of 29.6m
shares. Other electricals were mixed. Toshiba put on Y27 at Y869 but Fujitsu
fell Y20 to Y1,130. NTT climbed Y4,000 to Y886,000.
Analysts were generally encouraged by the renewed healthy activity in the
market, but caution prevailed because of the unstable political situation
and tomorrow's release of the tankan, a quarterly index of business
sentiment.
In Osaka the OSE average rose 178.01 to 23,530.64 in volume of 62m shares.
Roundup
A mixed performance was seen in the Pacific Rim.
HONG KONG declined 1.1 per cent, under pressure from a late fall in futures
prices and weakness in the property sector as investors assessed the impact
of government measures to cool the overheated housing market.
The Hang Seng index closed 100.54 lower at 9,190.64 as arbitrage trading was
seen between the physical and the futures market.
Among property issues, Cheung Kong dipped 75 cents to HKDollars 37.50,
Henderson Land HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 40.25 and Sun Hung Kai Properties
HKDollars 1.50 to HKDollars Dollars 50.50.
HSBC Holdings dropped HKDollars 1.50 to HKDollars 85.50, a day after Merrill
Lynch and SBC issued covered warrants on its shares and amid speculation
that warrants were about to be issued on shares in Hang Seng Bank and Hong
Kong Electric.
TAIPEI tumbled 2.6 per cent on profit-taking, mainly by domestic investors.
The weighted index shed 156.20 to 5,942.38 in TDollars 72.5bn turnover.
The electronics sector was the worst affected, with Acer falling by the
maximum permitted 7 per cent limit to TDollars 70.
SEOUL was mixed in moderate trading as selective gains were mostly offset by
marginal losses in blue chips. The composite index ended 2.77 higher at
935.79 as the impact on the market of the North Korean nuclear issue
appeared to be weakening.
KUALA LUMPUR was spurred higher by an unexpected flurry of late demand for
blue chips, and the composite index reversed early weakness to finish 12.41,
or 1.3 per cent, ahead at 981.72.
Tenaga moved forward 40 cents to MDollars 13.80 and Telekom 50 cents to
MDollars 19. Genting rose MDollars 1 to MDollars 31 as the market revised
the company's earnings forecasts upwards due to projections for better
earnings from its power unit, Genting Sanyen.
BOMBAY finished at a four-month high, the BSE 30-share index adding 104.04,
or 2.5 per cent, at 4,137.70. It was the first time that the index had
topped 4,100 since February 28, when India announced its national budget.
The index had since fallen, marking disappointment with the budget and in
response to the ban on badla or carry forward trading. The current revival
has been triggered by strong corporate results and the prospects of a normal
monsoon.
SINGAPORE was helped higher in thin trading by some late foreign demand for
blue chips which reversed earlier losses. The Straits Times Industrial index
advanced 16.69 to 2,282.34.
MANILA fell as investors took profits ahead of forthcoming new issues. The
composite index shed 26.3 to 2,990.85 in turnover of 900.1m pesos.
SYDNEY was discouraged by weaker bonds which dragged equities down later in
the session. After a day's high of 2,090.5, the All Ordinaries index ended a
net 3.0 off at 2,076.7. Turnover amounted to ADollars 519.9m.
Strength in commodity prices helped Western Mining rise 17 cents to ADollars
8.12, while MIM was up 5 cents at ADollars 3.22.
WELLINGTON shrugged off early weakness to finish a thinly traded session
higher on rises in a number of major issues. The NZSE-40 capital index
gained 9.52 at 2,125.87 in turnover of NZDollars 33.7m.

FT  10 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets: Vienna rises ahead of referendum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM COCHRANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Speculation on the outcome of Sunday's referendum on joining the European
Union took Austrian share prices up a further 1.4 per cent yesterday for a
two-day rise of 5.1 per cent, writes William Cochrane.
The Vienna stock market's ATX index ended 14.82 higher on the day at
1,067.65 after aiming for a more spectacular gain, in which it recorded an
intraday high of 1,081.55. This followed a 3.6 per cent advance on Wednesday
as speculators bought for a 'yes' vote, and short-covering assumed panic
proportions following a key chart reversal.
However, brokers were cautious about the upswing. Mr Frank Jonuschat at
James Capel in London noted that the ATX hit a 1994 low of 1,011.38 as
recently as Monday, down by 17.3 per cent from its February 1 high for the
year.
Yesterday's gains, he said, were inclined more towards the utility and
construction stocks, which had been hit severely by the market's decline
this year, rather than the highly cyclical shares that had outperformed.
In this, said Mr Jonuschat, investors were hedging their bets because they
were cautious about the outcome of the referendum.

FT  10 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets: Firm bullion price picks Johannesburg
up from lows
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Equities picked up from the session's lows, helped by the firmer gold
bullion price.
Foreign investors were reported as remaining reluctant to enter the market
ahead of the budget on June 22 and before further clarification of economic
policy.
The overall index gained a net 3 at 5,586 and industrials 2 at 6,593, while
golds lost 15 on balance at 1,995.
The mining sector was mixed - Gencor put on 20 cents at R11.40 and Anglovaal
slipped R5 to R130. Lonrho relinquished 10 cents to R9.90 in spite of higher
first-half profits.
De Beers shed 25 cents to R114.25, while Anglos added R1 at R232.50.
Remgro bounced 25 cents to R28 following improved annual results, while
Premier finished 5 cents firmer at R6.50, also following better earnings for
the year.
Oryx, the developing gold mine which is finalising refinancing plans, shed
15 cents to R4.50. Loraine, the marginal gold mine, receded 25 cents to R16.
The Argus, threatened by strike action, dropped R3 to R45 after a strong
rise on Wednesday ahead of the Argus Newspapers division's listing on June
13.

FT  10 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Daimler drops 3% on rights
issue terms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Activity was muted yesterday as some of the Continent's markets began voting
in the European elections, with others to follow on Sunday, writes Our
Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT saw selective selling of senior blue chips, although there was no
direct reaction to the Bundesbank's decision to hold key interest rates at
their existing levels.
The Dax index fell 15.88 to 2,129.32, rising slightly to an Ibis-indicated
2,131.72 by the end of the post-bourse. Turnover was unchanged at DM6bn.
Dax stocks which lost most ground included Daimler, down DM22 to DM782.50
after the announcement of its rights issue terms, and Volkswagen, DM11.30
lower at DM473.50. Mr Hans-Peter Wodniok of Robert Fleming Securities in
Frankfurt said the sheer size of the Daimler issue, nearly DM3bn, should
have affected the market as a whole.
Other blue chip fallers included Linde, DM16 weaker at DM923, and RWE, DM10
cheaper at DM441. Mr Wodniok commented that it did not take a lot of selling
to hit the engineer's share price; but that the utility group's shares had
been unsettled for some time over the conflict between state and private
shareholders regarding the future management of the RWE group.
PARIS lost most of Wednesday's gains as the market remained unable to break
out of its current trading range. The CAC-40 index was off 18.42 at 2,028.39
after a low of 2,011.54. Turnover was around FFr4bn.
Suez dipped FFr4.50 to FFr311 as Generali, of Italy, confirmed that it had
withdrawn a bid for the Groupe Victoire subsidiary. Suez has said that it
would make an announcement on the future of its subsidiary by June 15.
Euro Disney lost FFr1.50 to FFr34.10 as investors reacted to Wednesday's
rights issue news.
MILAN was overcome by technical factors ahead of next week's close of the
monthly account and with the tax incentives to boost industry, announced
late on Wednesday, proving in line with expectations.
The Comit index fell 4.21 to 756.23 in the absence of foreign demand and
with domestic funds holding back in preparation for the Ina privatisation on
June 27.
The insurance sector, already weakened by investors lightening holdings
ahead of the flotation, was further hit by the ruling by Italy's anti-trust
body fining 11 companies a total of L20bn for setting up a cartel in the
non-life insurance sector.
Among those to be fined, Generali lost L732 or 1.6 per cent to L44,384, Ras
dipped L588 or 2 per cent to L28,350, Fondiaria fell L151 to 14,975, and Sai
shed L112 to L23,421. News that Generali was withdrawing its offer for
Groupe Victoire came too late to influence trading.
Montedison dipped L14 to L1,466 in continuing heavy volume of 32.9m shares
on profit taking after the European Union's go-ahead for the plastics joint
venture with Shell.
Fiat dipped back below L7,000, losing L83 to L6,922 amid some disappointment
at the absence of incentives to boost car sales in the government's economic
package.
AMSTERDAM drifted down, the AEX index finishing off 1.24 at 405.26.
Amev, the financial services group, which reported a first quarter rise in
profits of 18 per cent, eased 20 cents to Fl 77.30.
Nedlloyd was another of the day's losers, down 30 cents at Fl 67.50. The
shipping group said that it expected further improvement in capacity on Far
Eastern routes.
ZURICH was lower on futures related selling and with the market hesitant
ahead of today's US producer prices. The SMI index fell 23.9 to 2,777.2.
Nestle continued to be actively trading, but fell SFr5 to SFr1,194, unable
to hold on to a high of SFr1,210.
Sandoz registered, which attracted positive comment from analysts earlier in
the week, managed a further SFr2 rise to SFr720. SMH, under pressure since
it said on Tuesday that it expected only modest profit growth this year,
bounced SFr14 higher to SFr815 as buyers returned at the lower price and the
watchmaker attracted a recommendation from one bank.
COPENHAGEN made an advance for the seventh consecutive session although the
KFX index was only slightly higher at 103.97, up 0.21.
Tele Danmark was the session's most active issue but the B shares closed
unchanged at DKr320.
The food and drinks sector advanced on hopes of recovery in the economy:
Danisco rose DKr6 to DKr960.
WARSAW fell 5 per cent, through the psychologically important 10,000 point
support level and to its lowest value this year. Concentrated speculative
selling left the Wig index 509 lower at 9,712.7 amid worries that the slide
would continue in coming sessions. Losers led gains by 21 to one, with two
issues unchanged.
TEL AVIV climbed 3.9 per cent amid heavy demand from institutional buyers
taking the market's cumulative gain over the week to 5.2 per cent. The
Mishtanim index rose 6.96 to 185.45. This week's performance came after a
month in which the market lost almost a quarter of its value.
