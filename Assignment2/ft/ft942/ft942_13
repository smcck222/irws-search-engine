FT  10 JUN 94 / Markets Report: US PPI figure awaited
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar traded in a fairly narrow range yesterday ahead of the release
today of the US May producer price inflation figure, write Philip Gawith and
Motoko Rich.
The US currency gained some support, however, following concerns about
escalating tensions in the Korean pen-insula. The dollar closed in London at
DM1.6721 from DM1.6698 and against the yen at Y104.155 from Y104.030. But in
New York it declined to end at DM1.6672 and Y103.985.
Markets were generally fairly quiet in the absence of any new developments
to latch on to. European election results will not be known until Monday,
and the decision of the Bundesbank council to leave interest rates unchanged
was widely expected.
Sterling finished firmer against the D-Mark at DM2.5206 from DM2.5163. It
was barely changed against the dollar at Dollars 1.5075 from Dollars 1.507.
The market is expecting a fairly subdued PPI figure today of about 0.2 per
cent. But Mr Peter Osler, economist at brokers GNI, warned that 'the risks
have to be stacking towards the fact that at some stage a shock high monthly
figure will be seen, and we expect the market will take this very badly'.
He said factors such as higher crude oil and commodity prices, as well as
increased capacity utilisation, can be expected to feed through into higher
inflation.
The implications for the dollar are unclear. Recently the dollar and the US
treasury bond market have traded in tandem. But Mr George Magnus, chief
economist at SG Warburg, has pointed out that 'the positive correlation
between the dollar and the T-bond market has rarely been strong for long
periods of time and is mostly negative'.
Mr Steve Hannah, head of research at IBJ International in London, said the
dollar/ D-Mark rate was likely to stay in a narrow range unless a 'major
surprise' came out of the PPI, or CPI number next Tuesday.
On the dollar/yen axis, however, Mr Hannah said he believed there had been a
definite shift in attitude recently. In spite of Mr Brown and Mr Kantor
still talking tough, he felt the administration 'did not see a weaker dollar
as a way of getting around this problem'.
'There is a lot of hesitation among speculators to push the yen too much
towards the Y103 level,' added Mr Hannah.
The market is expecting the Bank of Japan's quarterly tankan survey of
industry, released today, to show a modest rise in business optimism. A
better than expected outcome could bolster the yen.
In Europe, currencies paid little attention to the European elections, with
results not expected until after the weekend. 'There has been no adverse
effect on the Scandinavian economies which have been the main targets of
speculation,' said Mr Adrian Cunningham, international economist at UBS. 'It
seems to be an issue that was a focus earlier in the week.'
The D-Mark continued on its weak trend of the past 48 hours. Mr Avinash
Persaud, head of currency research at JP Morgan (Europe), attributed this to
diminishing faith in the credibility of the Bundesbank.
'The D-Mark's weakness is something of a surprise, given the strength of
manufacturing and inflation data,' he said. 'The German currency's weakness
must to some extent relate to fresh concerns about the Bundesbank's poor
performance on the M3 indicator.'
Mr Cunningham said Sunday's Austrian referendum on joining the European
Union may cause the D-Mark to 'pull back some of its losses against the
Scandinavian currencies'.
The D-Mark closed at FFr3.405 against the French franc from FFr3.408. It
also lost ground against the Spanish peseta, which finished at Pta81.71 from
Pta81.84, while the Swedish krona recovered some of its recent loss to end
at SKr4.740 from SKr4.754.
Mr Cunningham said sterling had benefited from the weakness of the D-Mark.
He predicted that European and by-elections would probably have little
effect on the pound because forecasts in the last 24 hours had anticipated
'less than devastating results' for the Tories.
Futures markets were quiet, with the December short sterling contract
trading only 15,000 lots. It closed at 93.77 from 93.79. The futures market
is thus discounting short-term interest rates nearly a percentage point
higher by the end of the year than the present 5.25 per cent. But many
economists believe interest rates may well finish the year at current
levels, or only marginally higher.
Mr Ostler of GNI, however, notes that at the last six settlement dates for
short-sterling contracts, the difference between the settlement price and
the base rate was less than 10 basis points. This suggests that the futures
market is currently over-pessimistic about the outlook for UK interest
rates.
In the UK money markets, the Bank of England provided Pounds 524m assistance
after forecasting a shortage of Pounds 500m. Overnight money traded between
3 1/2 and 4 5/8 per cent.
In Germany, call money eased to 4.95/5.05 per cent from 5.05/5.15 per cent.

FT  10 JUN 94 / Survey of Uganda (11): Door to recovery unlocked - Michael
Holman visits a town that has discovered new hope for the future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The group of visitors from Kampala waited for the owner to unlock the doors
with the tense anticipation of Egyptologists unsealing the burial chamber of
a pyramid.
It was only a run-down warehouse, just off the main street of Gulu, in
north-west Uganda. But earlier investigation had suggested that what it
might contain could assist the recovery of a town battered by past conflict.
The warehouse owner unlocked the padlock, the doors creaked open. Amid gasps
of astonishment a shaft of sunlight revealed the contents of the gloomy
interior: several huge wood crates.
A few puffs of breath dispelled the layer of dust, exposed the hieroglyphics
below, Georg Sahn, Escwege, West Germany, via Mombasa, and confirmed that
the crates, dispatched in 1983, contained hundreds of thousands of dollars
worth of weaving equipment. More than 10 years later, they remained as
securely sealed as the day they were sent on a 10,000-mile journey to a town
in a cotton-growing region of central Africa.
Martin Hogg, deputy executive director of the Uganda Investment Authority,
whose inquiries led to the find, will help co-ordinate efforts to put the
machinery to work.
The next stop was a possible beneficiary - the ginnery owned by the members
of the West Acholi Co-operative Union, where Mr RA Oneka, the manager, sets
the machines running to demonstrate progress in the factory's
rehabilitation, a critical step in Gulu's recovery.
Like everything else, the cotton sector was destroyed by a war that goes
back to 1986, when various rebel factions began a bitter resistance to the
incoming National Resistance Movement.
Ginneries were ruined, farmers fled, their crops abandoned. The community's
cattle were killed or stolen, leaving their owners without draught animals
to help plough. And without draught power, the land's potential can barely
be tapped, explained Julis Peter Obal, in charge of Gulu district
agricultural office.
But the first step to recovery has been the peace initiative, spearheaded by
Mrs Betty Bigombe, minister of state of the prime minister's office who also
has responsibility for implementing the government's northern Uganda
rehabilitation programme.
Peace has allowed the railway to Gulu to operate after a lengthy break, and
at the market that springs up alongside the station on the day the train
comes in, sorghum, maize, ground nuts, beans and sugar cane are plentiful,
along with what must be some of the world's cheapest and most succulent
mangoes.
They would cost at least a dollar or more in the supermarkets of Europe. In
Gulu, the surplus overwhelms the market, and a bucketful goes for 50
shillings (5 US cents).
Phillip Wilson Odong, the deputy central government representative in Gulu,
enthusiastically supports a suggestion that the mango flesh could be dried,
packed, and exported.
Later in the day at Arua, about 100 miles to the west, and a handful of
miles from Zaire, a drive around the town shows that there, too, life is
slowly recovering, but, unlike Gulu, power comes from a generator and
contact with the outside world is by radio.
Awongo Ahmed, the central government representative, supports Mr Hogg's
proposal that the Investment Agency help establish a bonded warehouse that
could cater for traders from across the border.
But Arua is uncomfortably close to Sudan, where the civil war in the south
seems to get worse by the day, forcing more and more civilians to take
refuge in Uganda; and nor is Gulu immune from the fighting. If Ugandans are
to be certain that they can live in peace, their neighbours must also settle
their internal disputes.

FT  10 JUN 94 / Survey of Uganda (9): Mood of optimism - Leslie Crawford on
seven years of political stability
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The opening of the Masala Chaat Indian takeaway in Kampala was a grand
affair. Its concrete backyard brimmed with the cream of Ugandan society.
Government dignitaries mingled with bankers; the US ambassador chatted with
Asian and Ugandan families. Ms Mumtaz Kassam, a returned Ugandan Asian,
surveyed her restaurant with satisfaction. Her guest of honour, Finance
Minister Joshua Mayanja-Nkangi, delivered an effusive inauguration speech.
They were celebrating, in a modest way, the seven years of stability which
have allowed Ugandans to start rebuilding their lives. Small ventures such
as Ms Kassam's takeaway are a psychological boost to a capital still haunted
by abandoned villas and boarded-up businesses. Kampala, like the rest of the
country, is only a shadow of its former self. But there is a mood of
optimism and a sense of renewal which are rare in Africa today.
President Yoweri Museveni, the architect of Uganda's newfound stability, is
not an easy man to define. An intellectual-turned-soldier, he would be the
World Bank's model African statesman - if only he could be persuaded to
accept western-style democracy. Mr Museveni advocates an open economy,
respect for human rights, a free press and contested local elections, but he
does not believe in multiparty politics.
In its stead, Mr Museveni offers his National Resistance Movement, a broad
church which has taken several political opponents into its fold.
At the village level, Mr Museveni has introduced elected 'resistance
councils' which decide local tax and spending policies and keep government
officials in check. Most Ugandans regard the councils as better than the
former system, inherited from colonial rule, in which government-appointed
village chiefs were a law unto themselves. The resistance councils in turn
nominate delegates to the next tier of government, at parish and district
levels. Topping this edifice is the National Resistance Council, which has
functioned like a legislature for the past seven years.
Participation in the NRM is voluntary, and membership is not mandatory for
Ugandans who wish to stand for public office. But by forcing candidates to
stand as individuals, rather than as representatives of parties, Mr Museveni
ensures there can be no organised challenge to his power.
'This is not a perpetual situation,' Eriya Kategaya, the NRM's national
political commissar, says in defence of the 'movement system' of government.
'We do not rule out a multiparty system for Uganda in the future, but for
the time being, people still associate the old political parties with chaos.
'The NRM does not seek to obliterate ethnic or religious differences,' Mr
Kategaya adds, 'it wants to obliterate the misuse of ethnicity and religion
for political ends.'
As a result, the March elections for a constituent assembly to design
Uganda's new constitution were not without an element of confusion.
Political rallies were banned, and candidates were forbidden to reveal their
political allegiances, although these were well known among the voters.
Instead, they were allowed to 'debate' their views in meetings organised by
local electoral commissions.
The most hotly debated issue was a clause in the draft constitution that
seeks to ban multiparty politics for another five years.
Mr Museveni's detractors - mainly northern and eastern communities which
formed the stronghold for Milton Obote, a former president now living in
exile - regard the Constituent Assembly as an attempt to legitimise the NRM
and Mr Museveni's unelected rule.
'The law has locked us out,' says Mrs Cecilia Ogwal of Mr Obote's Uganda
Peoples Congress. 'Why should we have to field candidates clandestinely? Why
are western donors backing Museveni's regime? They are apologists for a
manipulated democracy.'
But Mr Museveni's victory in presidential elections due later this year is
already a foregone conclusion. Since the new constitution allows a president
to serve for two consecutive five-year terms, Mr Museveni could well be in
power until 2004.
The fact that this does not alarm a majority of Ugandans speaks for Mr
Museveni's unrivalled popularity and for the overriding value placed on
peace and stability. Most Ugandans believe multiparty democracy can wait.
However, even Mr Museveni's supporters worry about the stability of a
political system which hinges entirely on the will of one man. The wounds in
Ugandan society run deep, and nobody cares to speculate about what would
happen to the country if Mr Museveni were suddenly no longer on the scene.

FT  10 JUN 94 / Survey of Uganda (8): On the track of gentle giants - Leslie
Crawford looks at tourism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The heart of Bwindi's Impenetrable Forest in southern Uganda is home to
almost half the world's population of mountain gorillas - a rare and
endangered species of which fewer than 650 remain. To protect Bwindi's
gentle giants, gorilla tracking permits are strictly rationed: only six
visitors are allowed to enter Bwindi national park each day. Even if
gorillas are not sighted, the experience of exploring Bwindi's virgin
jungle, under the canopy of huge tropical hardwoods, lianas and orchids, is
mysterious and unforgettable.
For the foreseeable future, Uganda's appeal to the foreign visitor will
centre on 'special interest' activities: mountain trekking in the Ruwenzoris
 -the legendary Mountains of the Moon; a visit to Bwindi, or the equally
remote savannah grasslands of the Kidepo Valley near the frontier with
Sudan. It is also in Uganda where the Nile begins its 4,000-mile journey to
the Mediterranean.
International tour operators have begun to include Uganda on their East
African safari circuits, encouraged by the country's efforts to recover its
neglected tourism infrastructure. Abercrombie &amp; Kent have set up two tented
camps near Bwindi and Murchison Falls, and plan to transform the Lake
Victoria Hotel near Entebbe into their five-star showcase in Uganda. Tim
Somerset Webb, president of A &amp; K Overseas Ltd, says he is finalising an
agreement for the management contract and an equity participation in Lake
Victoria Hotel with the state-owned Uganda Hotels Ltd.
Accommodation in Kampala remains overpriced and somewhat below international
standards, but a number of hotels in the capital are undergoing upgrading
and renovation. About 40 local tour operators provide an increasing range of
services for the adventurous traveller.
At the Uganda Tourist Board, above the British Council offices in Kampala,
Freddie Irumba likes to take the long-term view. 'We have to be both
cautious and sensible about promoting Uganda as a holiday destination,' he
says. 'Until our hotels are rehabilitated, the road network improved and our
passenger handling facilities at the airport are up to scratch, we should
not aim to attract large numbers of visitors.' He says the number of
visitors is rising by 20 per cent each year, and estimates arrivals will top
80,000 in 1994.

FT  10 JUN 94 / Survey of Uganda (7): Brewing up exports of tea and coffee -
Leslie Crawford investigates the revival in agriculture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Along the south-western route to Mbarara, the steady traffic of lorries
piled high with plantains is evidence of Uganda's agricultural recovery.
Political stability has breathed new life into war-shattered villages, while
the liberalisation of agricultural prices has lured peasants out of
subsistence farming into cash crops. Rural Uganda is humming with the
activity of carpenters, bricklayers, bicycle repair men and tailors. The
once bare shelves of village shops are again filled with goods.
But the poverty which engulfs most rural households is testimony to 25 years
of foregone development. Uganda today produces only 20 per cent of the
cotton it grew in 1970, and less than half the tea crop of pre-Idi Amin
years. Sugar and coffee have yet to recover pre-1970 production levels.
It is a sad indictment for a country uncommonly blessed with fertile soils
and abundant rainfall. More than 80 per cent of land is suitable for
agriculture, compared with less than 20 per cent in neighbouring Kenya.
'Uganda should be the grain basket of the region, but only one third of its
land area is being sensibly cultivated,' says James Cartwright, a consultant
on agricultural exports. 'It should be exporting maize and beans and
plantains to neighbouring countries. These are the crops that hold the
greatest export-earning potential.'
The Robusta coffee grown by thousands of peasant farmers in western Uganda
forms the backbone of the export economy. Coffee earned Dollars 106m, or
two-thirds of Uganda's export revenues last year. Production is responding
to firmer international prices and marketing reforms which have generated
greater returns for producers.
Government officials are cautiously optimistic over the recent surge in
international coffee prices, which have more than doubled to almost Dollars
1 a pound in the past 12 months. If prices hold, Uganda's coffee exports
could earn Dollars 250m, according to Uganda's Coffee Development Authority.
For the first time since the collapse of the International Coffee
Organisation cartel in 1989, the price gains would allow Uganda to meet its
external debt repayments from its coffee earnings, and even reduce its
dependence on foreign aid to cover its Dollars 700m-a-year import bill.
The Coffee Development Authority estimates production in the 1993-94 season,
which ends in September, at 2.5m 60-kg bags (150,000 tonnes), up from 2.09m
bags in 1992/93.
Both production and international coffee prices, however, remain below those
of the commodity boom of the late 1970s, when coffee earned Uganda more than
Dollars 400m a year. In a bid to revive the sector, the government abolished
export taxes on coffee in 1992, liberalised producer prices and licensed
private traders.
The old Coffee Marketing Board, which monopolised coffee exports until 1990,
is now a government-owned trading company competing with 36 private
exporters. The private sector has scooped up more than 70 per cent of the
coffee trade, with fierce competition pushing up the prices paid to farmers.
Uganda, however, is still paying the price for the political upheaval and
misguided agricultural policies of the past.
'Our coffee plantations are old and in poor shape,' says Dr Peter Ngategize,
research and development manager at the Coffee Development Authority. 'We
have to invest in research and extension services to improve the quality and
productivity of our shambas (farms).' He says Uganda is slowly
rehabilitating its coffee nurseries and selecting new Robusta strains to
replace old bushes.
Great hopes are also being pinned on the revival of the tea sector, which
once produced more than 25,000 tonnes a year. Tea production almost ceased
when the foreign owners of large estates left Uganda in the 1970s.
The return of UK companies such as James Finley, and the rehabilitation of
estates, has increased output from 1,200 tonnes in 1982 to 12,320 tonnes
last year. Little tea, however, has been planted since 1978, and the
production from tough old bushes is not of export quality. Consequently, tea
exports earned a meagre Dollars 11m last year.
Foreign investors, however, have detected Uganda's potential to become a
quality tea exporter.
A freshly-painted sign outside the Ankole tea estate near Bushenyi in
western Uganda reveals a recent change of ownership. In January, the UK's
Commonwealth Development Corporation and James Finley acquired the Ankole
estate and five other plantations totalling 3,000 hectares which were being
privatised by the government.
At the Ankole estate, Eric Mugambage, the factory manager, is proud to have
kept the operation running throughout the Amin years and Uganda's civil war,
although he regrets that the quality of his tea has declined.
'The bushes are old, the stalks are hard and we haven't been able to afford
the application of fertilizer for a long time,' he says. The tea factory,
where the leaves are withered, fermented and then dried, is also in need of
new equipment. The drying kilns are fuelled with wood: diesel is too
expensive and electricity too unreliable.
Tom Harrison of CDC says the other estates are also overgrown and in poor
shape. 'Our aim is to put quite a lot of money into rehabilitating the
factories and fields,' he says. 'We will be exporting the tea to generate
foreign exchange for Uganda.'
A Dollars 24m investment programme is expected to boost output at CDC's
Ugandan tea estates from 1,000 to 9,000 tonnes over the next eight years.

FT  10 JUN 94 / Survey of Uganda (6): Aids on the increase - Widespread
practice of polygamy exacerbates the problem
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Despite an active education and prevention programme, the number of reported
acquired immune deficiency syndrome (Aids) cases continues to rise in
Uganda. The level of HIV infection varies from 5 per cent in rural areas to
38.5 per cent in some main-road trading centres and towns.
The government's Aids Control Programme recorded more than 42,000 cases of
full-blown Aids by the end of 1993, although the figures do not represent
the true extent of the epidemic.
The Federation of Ugandan Employers, which sponsors an Aids prevention
programmes in the workplace, says peer-group education has had a significant
impact in promoting the use of condoms.
On the other hand, recent medical studies suggest public health campaigns
are unsuccessful. One research programme in the Rakai district of western
Uganda revealed that 3 per cent of respondents who were free of infection in
1989 had become HIV positive a year later. The respondents knew about the
Aids menace, and yet many of them admitted to having multiple sexual
partners.
In addition to the universal problem of persuading people to alter their
sexual behaviour, Uganda faces particular difficulties in fighting Aids.
The widespread practice of polygamy, and the low status of women (who, in
many rural areas, still kneel before men when they meet) give women little
control over their own sexual health and that of their partners.
'Much of the preventive education of the west is not applicable in Uganda,'
says Ms Marble Magesi of Taso, a Ugandan counselling service for Aids
sufferers. 'What does monogamy mean to a man who already has three wives?'
The influence of the Roman Catholic Church, which opposes the use of condoms
to prevent the disease, has not helped educators in the populous west and
south of the country, where Aids infection is most widespread.
In addition, it is feared that the demobilisation of soldiers will also
spread the disease, as the rate of HIV infection in the army is believed to
be higher than 50 per cent.
The government's Aids control programme admits it can do little to help
adults who have already contracted the disease. But it is placing special
emphasis on educating children between the ages of five and 15 to keep them
free from disease. But already, statistics show that young girls in the
15-19 age group are six times more likely to be Aids carriers than boys of
the same age. Part of the explanation is that men increasingly prefer young
sexual partners on the assumption that they are free from infection.

Crocodiles, vanilla pods, roses and the colossal Nile perch of Lake Victoria
do not, on the face of it, have much in common, but they belong to a growing
list of non-traditional exports which last year earned Dollars 40m for
Uganda.
The emergence of new, export-oriented ventures is perhaps the best economic
news Uganda has had in years. Many analysts believe the country's future
development depends on the multiplication of these small, private-sector
businesses. Neither the privatisation of bankrupt parastatals, nor Uganda's
international road shows to attract foreign investment, seem to hold as much
promise as the eclectic activities of Uganda's new entrepreneurs.
Tony Bristow left his native Zimbabwe to start up Uganda's first crocodile
farm three years ago. A Ugandan friend, who had worked in Zimbabwe,
convinced him the project would succeed with the tax breaks and liberalised
foreign exchange environment available to new investors in Uganda.
The novelty of the project at first baffled the authorities. Mr Bristow had
to obtain the authorisation of three different ministries - Animal and
Fisheries, the Game Department and National Parks - to set up Uganda Crocs
Ltd. He also helped draft Uganda's proposal to join the UN Convention for
the International Trade of Endangered Species (Cites), that regulates the
export of crocodile skins. Cites allocated Uganda an initial export quota of
2,500 skins a year.
Mr Bristow collects crocodile eggs in the wild, and breeds them in
captivity. The cold-blooded creatures are warmed to an optimal temperature
of 32 deg C to accelerate their development. After two to three years, the
crocodiles are ready for marketing.
Only half a dozen tanneries around the world specialise in exotic leathers,
and they pay between Dollars 2.5 and Dollars 7 per centimetre for the soft
underbelly of a young croc. The Gulf War, Mr Bristow says, depressed demand
for crocodile skins. He thinks it may take four years before he sees a
return on his Dollars 500,000 investment.
In Mukono, a district near Kampala, more than 5,000 peasant farmers now have
vanilla vines interplanted with their banana, maize and coffee bushes thanks
to an export venture started in 1990 by Aga Sekalala, a local businessman.
'After the war ended in '86,' he recalls, 'I was looking for cash crops to
plant on my farm.' He sought advice from the World Bank's Africa Project
Development Facility, which noticed, during a visit to Mr Sekalala's farm,
that vanilla was growing wild among the food crops.
APDF came back with a proposal: it would find a guaranteed buyer for Ugandan
vanilla if Mr Sekalala could persuade the farmers of Mukono to revive the
vanilla production that had been abandoned during the Amin years.
After testing Mr Sekalala's vanilla, McCormick &amp; Company of the US, the
manufacturer of seasonings and flavourings, signed a three-year agreement in
1990 to purchase his entire production. The contract has just been renewed
for another three years.
Meanwhile, the vanilla growers involved in Mr Sekalala's venture have
multiplied from 50 in 1990 to 5,000. Vanilla fields now cover an estimated
600 hectares. 'Over the past four years,' Mr Sekalala says, 'we have
exported more than nine tonnes of cured vanilla worth a total of Dollars
825,286.'
Premium-grade cured vanilla commands about Dollars 72 per kg on the world
market. Within 10 years, it is estimated Uganda could be exporting up to 150
tonnes of vanilla a year, pushing foreign exchange earnings up to Dollars
7.5m.
Half a dozen Ugandan companies have launched themselves into the rose
exporting business, after observing how floriculture has blossomed in
neighbouring Kenya.
'Uganda has a more favourable climate for rose growing than Kenya,' says
Rene Bartoli of Victoria Flowers, 'and it is not plagued by water
shortages.' In addition, the cost of air freight - the largest outlay of any
flower export operation - is more competitive from Entebbe airport than
Nairobi.
This combination of factors is leading many established Kenyan flower
companies to look at Uganda to diversify their sources of production.
Mr Bartoli and a Ugandan partner have bought a 3.3 hectare plot on the
shores of Lake Victoria to start their rose farm. At Dollars 400,000 a
hectare, their initial investment carries a considerable degree of risk,
particularly as returns will depend on the price their roses can fetch at
the flower auctions in Holland. The first roses will be ready for export in
October.
Launching a business in Uganda, however, is not for the faint-hearted.
'You have to be prepared to be completely autonomous and self-sustaining,'
Mr Bartoli warns. Because power supplies are unreliable, he had to invest in
a back-up generator. The lack of cold storage facilities at Entebbe airport
means that Victoria Flowers will have to build its own.
But the most common complaint of Uganda's new breed of exporters is the loss
of competitiveness of Uganda's currency, the shilling, which has appreciated
by more than 20 per cent against the dollar in recent months.
'The appreciation of the shilling could kill our business, particularly as
Indonesia is also making serious inroads into the vanilla market,' Mr
Sekalala says. 'I also had a project to export organic honey, but it is just
not competitive at the current exchange rate.'

FT  10 JUN 94 / Survey of Uganda (3): External debt - can an inflexible rule
be bent?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The structure of Uganda's external debt and the heavy toll of repayments on
the recovery programme tests the wisdom of the inflexible rule that
obligations to the multilateral institutions cannot be rescheduled, writes
Michael Holman.
The country's external debt, including principal and interest arrears at
Dollars 585.4m, comes to Dollars 2.7bn, equivalent to more than 100 per cent
of GDP. Total scheduled debt servicing for 1992-93 amounted to Dollars 173m,
more than 80 per cent of export earnings. The government was able to pay
less than half this amount.
Out of a total scheduled debt-service payment of USDollars 2bn for the
period 1993-2010, some Dollars 1.4bn will go to multilateral creditors -
principally the IMF and the World Bank, according to an Oxfam study
published earlier this year.*
Whereas the World Bank has maintained a positive net transfer of resources,
this has not been the case with the Fund, says Oxfam, the British aid
agency.
Between 1987 and 1990, there was a net transfer to the IMF from Uganda of
Dollars 90m. Although there has been a compensating positive transfer since
then, in the absence of new resources the sharp rise in repayment levels
from 1993 will again result in negative transfer, the Oxfam study points
out.
Payments to the IMF will peak in 1997, representing more than a third of
total debt payments, it calculates. Overall, says Oxfam, payments to the IMF
will exceed Dollars 200m between 1993 and 1998, resulting in a negative
transfer of resources to the Fund.
'In summary, the Ugandan government has no choice under existing debt rules
but to request additional bilateral aid to repay its multilateral debt. Its
dilemma starkly illustrates the case for a change in the rules and the
removal of the taboo against multilateral debt reduction,' the analysis
continues.
There is a further difficulty, notes Oxfam. Under exisitng Paris Club rules,
official creditors will not reschedule or reduce any debt contracted after a
fixed date, usually coinciding with the debtor country's first application
to the Club.
Uganda's cut-off date is 1981, which means that of the Dollars 65m of
arrears and maturities falling due to the Paris Club in 1993-94, as much as
Dollars 44m is not eligible for rescheduling or reduction. 'The upshot is
that Uganda's next trip to the Paris Club will result in savings of
approximately Dollars 9m, equivalent to 5 per cent of the country's annual
service bill.'
The cut-off date, argues Oxfam, should be moved to at least 1987, when the
NRM government came to power. 'A large proportion of bilateral debt was
inherited by the current government from the brutal and corrupt regimes of
Idi Amin and Milton Obote,' much of which was 'irresponsibly squandered and
irresponsibily lent'.

FT  10 JUN 94 / Survey of Uganda (4): Foreign exchange bonanza
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Uganda's single largest foreign investment project, capable of boosting
annual export earnings by 10 per cent a year over its 10-year life, is
poised for take-off.
And has been for a good many years, sceptics might add - ever since the
potential of a vast pyrites dump at Kilembe copper mine was first confirmed
more than 10 years ago.
This time it is different, say the project's backers, who point out that the
scheme is now well down the road to fruition, while Uganda's political and
economic climate has never been more encouraging.
Lying in the foothills of the Ruwenzori mountains, on Uganda's western
border with Zaire, the mine once produced 17,000 tonnes of blister copper a
year.
But the advent of Amin, coupled with the slump in world prices, proved its
downfall and its operational days as a copper mine are almost certainly
over.
The foreign exchange bonanza lies above ground, in the 1m-tonne pile of
pyrite concentrates accumulated since the mine opened in 1956. It contains
1.4 per cent cobalt, valued at about Dollars 200m, fluctuating according to
world prices, and this can be recovered.
Even allowing for capital outlay (about Dollars 40m) and running costs, the
net foreign exchange benefits are enormous for a country whose total exports
last year were worth USDollars 184m.
Efforts to start the project go back to 1991 when Bureau de Recherce
Geologiques et Miniers (BRGM) of France produced for Kilembe Mines Ltd a
pre-feasibility study which concluded that treatment of the pyrites by
bleaching was the most economic and environmentally safe way of recovering
the cobalt.
In June 1992, the Ugandan government signed a joint venture agreement with
BRGM and Barclays Metals Ltd (BML) of the UK to undertake the project. The
new Kasese Cobalt Company wil be jointly owned by the parastatal, Kilembe
Mines Ltd with a 45 per cent shareholding, BRGM (27.5) and BML (27.5).
Results from a pilot plant constructed at nearby Kasese in 1993 confirmed
its viability, and annual production of 1,000 tonnes over a 10 to 12 years.
A feasibility study followed, which confirms the merits of the project. All
being well, commercial production could begin within two years.

FT  10 JUN 94 / Survey of Uganda (2): A long haul ahead - Uganda has
achieved an economic turnaround
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN and LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Economic reforms, backed by donors and enthusiastically applied by the
government, have brought dramatic results. Uganda's economic growth has
averaged 5 per cent a year since 1988, inflation has fallen from 240 per
cent in 1986 to single figures, and foreign exchange reserves cover more
than three months of imports.
Meanwhile, the budget deficit stays within limits agreed with the IMF and
two critical areas of government spending are being tackled. The civil
service will end up half its original 300,000 size, and the army will also
be cut by half to 45,000 by the end of next year.
In the process, life for the business community has been radically changed.
Price controls have been lifted, foreign exchange controls abolished, and a
privatisation programme begun in 1992-93 is under way.
Meanwhile, foreign investors are returning, albeit cautiously, as are
expelled Asians, encouraged by legislation that has allowed them to reclaim
more than 3,000 properties expropriated by the Amin regime in the 1970s.
For any government these measures would represent a remarkable achievement,
let alone one with Uganda's history. But adding to the difficulties have
been deteriorating terms of trade - 65 per cent over the past six years - as
weakening coffee prices saw the crops' earnings drop from Dollars 384m in
1986 to Dollars 151m in 1992, recovering to Dollars 184m last year.
The trauma has been eased, however, by donors, who have increased assistance
from Dollars 230m in 1986 to more than Dollars 550m in 1993 with outright
grants rising from under 10 per cent of government income in 1988 to 52 per
cent last year.
Although this has allowed growth to be maintained, it has left Uganda
uncomfortably dependent on aid, and reaching levels of domestic and foreign
investment sufficient to lead to self-sustaining growth, is now the single
greatest challenge.
The current rate of 6 per cent of GDP is 'still too low to provide the basis
for rapid economic growth', warns a World Bank paper, and the impact on
investment from the privatisation programme, managed by Public Enterprise
Reform and Divestiture Secretariat, has proved disappointing.
Parastatals have been classified into five categories. The government will
retain full ownership of certain utilities, national parks and a development
bank. It will partially divest from hotels, mines and telecommunications.
Some 43 companies are slated for complete privatisation, while another 17
will be liquidated.
However, few of the 100-odd companies in state hands have the potential to
break even. The government has only privatised a handful of enterprises
since the programme began in 1991. A bottling company, a distillery, Shell
Uganda (which Shell bought back) and the tea estates of Agricultural
Enterprises Ltd are the only notable sales to date. Several textile and
spinning mills have been advertised, but the sector's plant is generally
obsolete, overstaffed and carrying bad debts.
Accompanying the privatisation programme has been the Uganda Investment
Authority's attempt to attract foreign investment, offering a range of
incentives first set out in 1991, designed to enhance the privatisation
programme.
It has managed to attract around Dollars 200m over two years, but it has not
been an easy process. 'Uganda has been isolated from the real world of
investment for so long, it doesn't know what the outside world wants or what
price it is prepared to pay for it,' says a foreign consultant in Kampala.
From one insider comes this blunt appraisal: 'Not one company has accounts
up to date. Where accounts exist, they are often false or inaccurate.'
Says another critic: 'The privatisation secretariat's recommendations to its
political masters are often ignored, or overturned, often in pursuit of
personal advantage for politicians and their associates.'
There is criticism, too, of the amount of time spent outside the country
promoting Uganda by senior government ministers and civil servants. The
returns are far from clear, while work at home suffers. In 1985, over 50 per
cent of government-collected revenue came from coffee exports, but during
1993 it was nil, for the tax had been abolished. Tax collection as a
percentage of GDP remains low - about 7 per cent, around a third the average
for sub-Saharan African countries, and is not expected to rise much above 10
per cent in the next two to three years.
The Uganda Manufacturers' Association vigorously resists efforts to increase
the burden on those already in the tax net. 'Uganda cannot afford to repulse
capital by giving investors cause to relocate in neighbouring countries,'
warned the association last year.
The business community has a further concern - the appreciating shilling.
High donor flows, improved coffee receipts and returning capital from Asian
exiles have seen the currency strengthen from a high of 1,373 in January
1993 to a current level of around 960 to the dollar.
This has resulted in artificially high import levels, which hurt the
domestic producers and has hit exporters.
Achievements notwithstanding, the task is a sobering one. If the economy
maintains an annual average of 5 per cent growth and assuming population
increase of between 2.5 and 3 per cent a year, it will take 30 years to
double individuals' standards of living.
At the same time, Uganda must reduce aid and reach self-sustaining growth -
the biggest challenge of all.

FT  10 JUN 94 / Survey of Uganda (1): Overcoming a disastrous legacy -
President Museveni has revived Uganda's fortunes and provided stability, but
the long-term challenge is to reduce aid and achieve self-sustaining growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN and LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A country once synonymous with tyranny and economic disaster is undergoing a
transformation.
Tourists are returning to Uganda's game parks. Asians expelled by Idi Amin
are returning to reclaim homes and businesses. And IMF officials have taken
up residence in the Central Bank offices in Kampala, where they are
scratching their heads over a rarely encountered problem: how to cope with
an appreciating African currency.
Eight years after Yoweri Museveni, then 41, and his National Resistance
Movement fought their way into power, Uganda has made remarkable progress in
overcoming as grim a legacy as any African government has known.
The chaos and slaughter of the eight-year regime of Idi Amin, and the havoc
wrought by the war that finally toppled him in April 1979, would have been
challenge enough.
It defeated no fewer than three governments, who wasted time and squandered
resources until December 1980, when the country went to the polls for its
first multiparty election since independence in 1962.
Far from marking a fresh start, it opened what was to prove another grim
chapter. Former president Milton Obote, ousted by Amin in 1971, returned
from exile to lead the Uganda Peoples Congress to victory in what many
regarded as a rigged poll.
By the time Mr Obote was forced to flee the country, a brief economic
revival had been destroyed by increasingly brutal suppression of dissent.
Mr Museveni, however, has triumphed over his inherited disaster ensuring
political stability, often through harsh measures, and by performing an
intellectual somersault in pursuit of economic recovery.
As late as August 1988, the president was attacking what he called the IMF
'orthodoxy', and seemingly resisting the government's Economic Recovery
Programme, launched in May the previous year.
'If you insist that market forces become the dominant feature in an
economy,' he told a Zambian audience, 'it will lead to increased trade
liberalisation.' This would be 'very dangerous', he warned, 'if it means
that anybody is allowed to import anything they like . . . I can compromise
with the IMF on other things but not on this.'
Mr Museveni must have had second thoughts. As reform gathered pace, all
restrictions on foreign exchange current account transactions were lifted
and today Uganda has the most liberal exchange rate policy in sub-Saharan
Africa, while the price controls he defended in the same speech have also
gone.
The results have been remarkable. GDP growth has averaged 5 per cent
annually since 1987. The budget deficit has shrunk, the size of the army and
civil service has declined, foreign exchange reserves are heathy, a
privatisation programme is under way, foreign investors are returning,
albeit cautiously, and the Ugandan shilling has strengthened by 18 per cent
against the US dollar over the past 18 months.
The benefits of economic orthodoxy are unmistakeable, and the evidence of a
recovery widespread, though far from uniform.
It is seen at its most striking on the journey south from Kampala to Masaka,
the road then curving north-west through Mbarara and on to Mweya Safari
Lodge, perched above Lake Edward on the western border with .
The journey took in a region which seemed to have been devastated beyond
recovery during the 1978-9 war, when invading Tanzanian troops and Ugandan
guerrillas forced Amin into exile.
Today, roadside kilns provide the bricks for a mini building boom, stalls
along the route sell maize, fruit and vegetable and matoke, the green banana
which is a staple food, and coffee bushes give way to rolling green tea
estates.
A separate journey to the far north-east showed that recovery is much weaker
in Gulu and Arua, ravaged by a more recent war, this time against the
Museveni government, waged since 1986 by rebel forces that range from a
bizarre religious sect to diehard supporters of past regimes. But even
there, a tentative peace is paving the way to a better life.
In Jinja, an hour's drive east from Kampala, the giant Kakira sugar estate,
part of the Madhvani business empire seized under Amin, is back with its
former owners. But a city that was once Uganda's industrial centre remains
depressed, with the government's privatisation programme failing to find
buyers for the state-owned factories with obsolete plants.
Corruption is also hampering the privatisation programme, say independent
commentators, who cite cases of delays and prevarication designed to favour
candidates with government links. For these and other reasons - few Ugandans
have been able to protect their savings from economic disasters of the past
 -the level of domestic and foreign investment falls well short of the level
required for Uganda's recovery to become self sustaining.
Mr Museveni, who frequently lectured fellow Africans on the dangers of
economic dependency on the west, now relies on aid to provide half his
government's income. Donors have increased assistance from Dollars 230m in
1986 to more than Dollars 550m in 1993, and outright grants have increased
from under 10 per cent of government income in 1988 to 52 per cent last
year.
And, as one leading donor recently warned, 'such sources are not
indefinitely sustainable'. None of this would have been possible without
stability provided by a government that is somewhere between a coalition and
an autocracy,
Within limits determined informally by Mr Museveni rather than by law,
opposition voices are heard, including that of an often critical press. But
any opposition that sets out to mount an organised challenge to the
president and the NRM and the concept of participatory one-party democracy
is effectively banned.
Under the all-embracing umbrella of the NRM are stalwarts of the two parties
which used to dominate Uganda's politics, including Paul Ssemogerere, leader
of the Democratic Party, and minister of foreign affairs, and Ateker Ejalu,
minister of labour, a prominent member of the Uganda Peoples Congress, once
led by self-exiled former president Milton Obote.
At the grass roots, Mr Museveni has introduced countrywide resistance
councils, with responsibility for community affairs. Meanwhile, a
constituent assembly, elected earlier this year, will draw up a new
constitution in which a multiparty system is not ruled out.
Whether this all adds up to a potential model for the rest of Africa,
struggling to combine economic and political reform, remains to be seen. So
far donors have given Mr Museveni the benefit of the doubt about this
protracted transition to a yet-to-be-defined democracy. This may be
pragmatic, but risks the charge of inconsistency.
Elsewhere in Africa they have made the introduction of multiparty politics a
condition to their aid. And while they have been critical of human rights
abuse by government, at its worst between 1986 and 1991, they appear to have
allowed Uganda a leeway not enjoyed by neighbouring Kenya.
Undoubtedly both donor and domestic tolerance of Mr Museveni's style owes
much to fear of what could be the alternative.
With stark reminders in their own recent past, and with death and disaster
in neighbouring Rwanda, Sudan and Zaire, stability may reasonably be prized
above multiparty politics by many Ugandans and donors alike.
'At its best,' summarises one western diplomat, 'Museveni's government can
be characterised as a government of cohabitation, led by a benevolent
military leader of strong intellectual quality.
'At its worst, it could be described as a government dominated by one man
and a small politico-military elite who are bent on imposing their
particular vision upon civil society.'
Just as the economy has to wean itself from aid dependency, so the political
system must end its dependence on one man if Uganda is to achieve long-term
stability.
At present, donors are prepared to accept Mr Museveni's de facto one-party
state as a transitional administration with special dispensations to deal
with the traumas of the past.
But the same donors are looking to see whether Mr Museveni has the vision
and the will to lay the foundations for a political system that will outlive
him.
At present, Mr Museveni has sufficient support in the new Constituent
Assembly to legalise his 'Movement' system of government until the turn of
the century - postponing the resumption of multiparty politics until then.
But western diplomats are warning Mr Museveni that if he fails to put in
place a democratic system based on freedom of association and freedom of
assembly, Uganda's stability will not last longer than his reign.
'He would only be delaying the return of political chaos to a very
fragmented and divided society,' says one ambassador in Kampala.
Economic and political reform should go hand in hand. When Ugandans and
potential foreign investors are confident of the latter, Uganda's economic
growth is more likely to become self-sustaining and the achievements of Mr
Museveni will be consolidated.
And should that happen, Uganda would indeed be a model for Africa.

FT  10 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Ecuador looks to Amazon for oil
production boost
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The Ecuadorean government has awarded international petroleum companies
rights to explore 2m hectares of Ecuador's Amazon rain forest. The move is
seen as evidence of the government's determination to boost proven crude oil
reserves and increase production dramatically in the coming decade.
Over the next three years, production is expected to increase by about 30
per cent from new fields coming on line.
The so-called Seventh Round of bidding has created great interest among
foreign investors because of the area's promising geological structures and
the government's recently introduced market-oriented reforms.
Ten companies, among them the US majors Mobil and Amoco, are to sign
contracts with the government before the end of the year. Other US companies
are participating in consortia with Canadian, Kuwaiti and Chilean companies.
The new contractual basis awards oil companies between 65 per cent and 85
per cent of production rather than the previously fixed level of
compensation. The companies are contracted to drill 17 wells, beginning in
July of next year, and have up to four years to complete the exploratory
phase. Production is expected to begin in 1999.
The exploratory phase will require an estimated USDollars 142m in foreign
investment, of which a total of Dollars 6.7m will go towards environment
protection efforts. Mr Francisco Acosta, the energy minister, stressed that
the government would apply strict environmental regulations.
According to officials of the state oil company, Petroequador, prospects for
discovering crude oil are good. So far 54 per cent of the exploratory wells
drilled in the country have yielded positive results. In some of the blocks
on which concessions have been awarded, oil fields have already been
discovered, though not explored.
New discoveries are expected to be of heavy crude oil. The average API has
already dropped from 30 to 28 and is forecast to fall to near 25 by 1999.
Two companies, BHP King and Tripetrol, have been awarded rights to explore
for natural gas in the Gulf of Guayaquil, on Ecuador's Pacific coast.

FT  10 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Talks on cocoa output
management break down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Members of the International Cocoa Organisation, who are meeting in London
this week, have failed to agree on rules covering a new production
management deal which was implemented in February.
On Wednesday the organisation agreed a new set of output and consumption
estimates to underly their discussions of the market for the next five
years.
However, talks broke down yesterday when consumers complained that their
views were not adequately represented enough on the production committee.
ICCO members have suggested opening their talks in September two days early
to discuss consumer representation.
Meanwhile the cocoa market appeared unmoved by the organisation's
vacillations and prices at the London Commodity Exchange were more
influenced by the fortunes of the coffee market. At the close of trading,
the September cocoa futures price recouped earlier losses to finish
unchanged at Pounds 1,003 a tonne.

<TEXT>
Canadian companies exploring for oil in Cuba have closed a well that
recently yielded light crude, to allow them to verify the size of the oil
field in Cardenas Bay to the east of Havana, the capital.
The deposit, which has a low sulphur content, is of a higher quality than
oil that has so far been found in Cuba, according to officials of
Cubapetroleo (Cupet), the state oil company.
It was found by Sherrit and Talisman Energy of Canada, which are among
several foreign firms prospecting in Cuba. The well was sunk to 3,240 metres
and the oil was found at 2,500 feet. Production is estimated at 3,750
barrels a day.
The discovery will be encouraging to Cuba's struggling domestic oil
industry, which has been unable to produce enough to meet a shortfall in
imports and end the island's crippling energy shortage. Imports last year of
5.7m tonnes of crude were about half of the island's needs.
Domestic production is expected to rise from 1993's 1.15m tonnes to 1.3m
tonnes this year. But Cupet officials are hoping for more significant growth
over the next few years if some of the foreign companies exploring onshore
and offshore find commercially exploitable deposits.
The Cubans are keenly awaiting the results of seismic studies of a
concession being explored by Taurus of Sweden, which they say has indicated
the presence of oil and gas.
The government says about Dollars 50m is being invested in oil production
this year by Cupet and foreign companies, following investments totalling
Dollars 20m last year. Following the granting of a six-year contract in 1991
to Total and Compagnie Europeanee des Petroles of France to search for oil
in Cuba, several other foreign companies have been searching for oil in
Cuba.
Canadian and European companies were invited in February 1993 to bid for
concessions to explore for oil onshore and offshore of the island, covering
11 blocks. Seven blocks are onshore, three offshore and one covering
offshore and onshore; they range in area between 1,400 sq km and 6,000 sq
km.
The contracts run for 25 years and are based on production sharing between
the foreign and local companies. The foreign companies are expected to
provide all the capital and the technology. The likely prospectors include
Andrade Gutierrez of Brazil, which is expected to take over an exploration
agreement between Cupet and Braspetro, Brazil's state-owned company.

<TEXT>
Quebrada Blanca, the first of several medium and large-scale copper projects
scheduled to start up in Chile over the next few years, is expected to begin
production by the end of this month, according to Mr James Drake, general
manager. The mine, a Dollars 360m Canadian-Chilean project, should reach
full capacity of 75,000 tonnes of grade A copper cathodes by the start of
1995 and is expected to have a life of 14 years.
Quebrada Blanca is a Chilean-registered company formed by shareholders
Cominco, Cominco Resources International and Teck Corporation of Canada,
which have a total equity stake of 76.5 per cent, Minera Pudahuel of Chile
(13.5 per cent) and state company Empresa Nacional de Mineria (10 per cent).
Cominco is responsible for design, construction and operation of the mine,
which will have a staff of 500.
Quebrada Blanca will use bacterial heap leaching and
solvent-extraction-electro-winning (SX-EW) technology to exploit the
89m-tonne secondary sulphide ore body, which has an average grade of 1.3 per
cent copper.
Production costs at the mine, situated in the far north of the Atacama
desert at an altitude of 4,300m, are expected to be less than 50 cents a
pound.
When the main deposit is exhausted, the company will decide whether it is
feasible to exploit the 200m-tonne primary sulphide sublayer, which has a
much lower copper grade of 0.5 per cent. 'It may be that it is viable - by
that time the technology may be better and the price of copper may make it
economically justifiable,' said Mr Drake.
Quebrada Blanca is just one of several new projects that are expected to
raise Chilean copper production - already the highest in the world - by a
further 1.3m tonnes to 3.5m tonnes by the year 2000.
Other projects due to start up before then include Cerro Colorado (annual
production of 40,000 tonnes), the giant Collahuasi deposit (300,000),
Zaldivar (120,000) and El Abra (225,000).
Much of the new production will use SX-EW technology, far less
environmentally destructive than traditional methods that require a smelting
process. By the turn of the century, about 25 per cent of Chilean copper
should be produced using this technique, compared with 8 per cent last year.

FT  10 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: US crop forecast hits wheat
prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wheat prices at the Chicago Board of Trade fell yesterday after the US
Department of Agriculture increased its monthly estimate of the US harvest
now in progress, and failed to make the expected cuts its projections for
crops in China and the former Soviet Union.
The USDA's estimates ran counter to private estimates that show China and
former Soviet crops under stress from long-term dryness.
The department's figures also failed to reflect new data from Oklahoma,
where the winter wheat harvest is nearly one-third complete and yields are
down substantially from last year, analysts said. Maize and soyabean futures
prices rose, as traders continued to focus on unusual dryness in the
Midwest.
Mr Bill Biedermann, a market analyst with Allendale, was puzzled by the
USDA's failure to adjust its crop prospects for the countries that have
historically been North America's biggest wheat customers.
'We've been concerned for 30 days about dryness in China and in what used to
be Russia. Now the government is saying there is no change in those (wheat)
crops from May to June,' he said.
The USDA maintained its wheat production estimate for Russia at 38.5m
tonnes, though it lowered output for the former Soviet Union to 74.3m
tonnes, from 74.8m a month ago. China's crop is projected to be near last
year's record, at 105m tonnes.
The agency boosted its US winter wheat production estimate to 1.67bn
bushels, above market projections for 1.638bn and up from its own estimate
of 1.65bn a month ago. The total US wheat crop, including spring wheat, is
now estimated at 2.37bn bushels.
Analysts said the report, which was based on crop conditions as of June 1,
did not reflect new information that the wheat harvest now in progress in
Oklahoma, a major winter wheat state, had been disappointing.
Farmers in south-western Oklahoma are reporting surprisingly low yields in
newly harvested fields.
Mr Tom Diel, executive director of the Oklahoma Wheat Commission, says
yields are ranging from 20 to 25 bushels an acre, making the USDA's
projection of 30 bushels look optimistic. Mr Diel expects, however, that
yields will improve as the harvest moves north. 'I'm hoping for a 154 to
155m bushel crop this year,' he says. That would be down about 6 per cent
from last year's wheat harvest of 163m bushels.

FT  10 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: 'Chemicals vital for African
agriculture'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Africa will have to start using large amounts of chemical fertilisers if the
continent is ever to solve its own food problems, according to Mr Norman
Borlaug, a prominent agriculturalist, who won the Nobel Peace prize in 1970
for engineering India's 'green' revolution.
Mr Borlaug told a meeting at the Overseas Development Institute yesterday:
'Some people say that Africa's food problems can be solved without the
application of chemical fertilisers. They're dreaming. It's not possible'.
He said that the environmentalists advocating traditional farming methods
failed to recognise the rapid growth in population expected in the
continent. The population of sub-Saharan Africa was set to double in the
next 22 years, he claimed, which would put a considerable strain on
non-chemical farming.
China had managed to transform its production of cereals in the five years
between 1975 and 1980, increasing yields by a tonne a hectare by using
chemical fertilisers, Mr Borlaug said. China's output of cereals had risen
from 238m tonnes to 285m tonnes during that period even though farmers had
already been using organic compost on the land.
Today China produced the most cereals in the world with average yields of 4
tonnes per hectare, Mr Borlaug said.
Sub-Saharan Africa had the lowest use of fertiliser in the world and soil
nutrients were so low that other efforts to raise crop productivity would
not be successful until fertility was improved.
Mr Borlaug said, however, that it was extremely expensive for African
countries to import fertiliser, and he called on industrialised nations to
provide the continent's farmers with access to adequate inputs.

Austaralia's main market indicator closed this week at exactly the same
figure as a week ago. 628 cents a kg. The offering was a small one, and only
in the final week iof the selling season at the end of June will a more
normal quantity of wool be sold. Dull conditions quite normally tend to
spread from end-of-season auctions to the rest of the wool-using industry,
especially as holidays and the approach of holidays have a similar
influenece. The fact that the wool market has managed to maintain strength,
with prices showing no significant setback since the Easter recess, has
helped to strengthen sentiment about the longer term outlook. Business may
be slow and competitive, but chances of buying more cheaply are sensed to be
receding.

An official said state veterinary authorities had agreed on a package of
measures that several states began taking last week against bovine
spongiform encephalopathy. Besides the slaughter ban, measures include
observation and veterinary checks on suspect herds. Cattle of UK origin can

FT  10 JUN 94 / Government Bonds: US Treasuries mixed ahead of inflation
data

US Treasury bonds drifted to mixed levels yesterday as traders squared their
positions before today's inflation data.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government issue was  1/16 better
at 87 5/8 , with the yield dipping to 7.271 per cent. At the short end, the
two-year note was down  1/32 at 100 5/32 , to yield 5.772 per cent.
Activity was sluggish, as most traders preferred to stay on the sidelines
until after this morning's release of the May producer price index. Bond
prices held fairly steady, as there was general optimism in the market that
inflation was still no threat to the value of fixed-rate securities.
Though the PPI itself, which reflects a backward view, is inherently of less
interest than statistics suggesting future trends, today's report may
provide a catalyst for a strong advance. Analysts were expecting bonds to
rally if the index matches expectations of a 0.2 per cent rise in wholesale
prices last month, or 0.3 per cent when the volatile food and energy sectors
are excluded.
There was a snippet of economic news out yesterday. The Labor Department
said initial claims for state unemployment benefit had held steady last
week. The market had been expecting a slight uptick in joblessness, but the
announcement barely caused a ripple of activity.
The more sombre tone in Europe caused UK government bond prices to ease.
With no new UK economic data, there was no follow-through after Wednesday's
substantial rise as investors took profits.
'European markets are on hold. They are still tracking the US and waiting to
see when the Federal Reserve tightens again and waiting for more real
economic data in Europe to see if the easing process is going to continue,'
said Mr Bob Pierce, head of gilt sales at Salomon Brothers.
Traders reported a lack of interest among buyers, particularly for
longer-dated maturities. Analysts said that there was some switching from
gilts into German government bonds.
Analysts said that investors' attention has also begun to turn to the Bank
of England's next gilt auction, due to be announced next week , which will
be a test of market sentiment. The long gilt future was down 17/32 point at
101 7/32 in late trading.
German bond prices suffered a further bout of weakness, following
indications earlier in the week of stronger economic growth which traders
fear will delay further interest rate cuts. Prices slid about 1/8 point, in
the absence of any fresh direction.
The Bundesbank council's inaction over interest rates at its fortnightly
meeting was in line with market expectations, as most analysts believe it is
still too early for a further rate cut.
Moderate retail interest, triggered when 10-year bond yields reached 7 per
cent earlier in the week, has tailed off, leaving the market without any
firm support.
Traders are now waiting to see whether the release of US producer price data
for May will provide any fresh impetus for the bund market.
The September bund future on Liffe ended seven basis points lower at 92.86.
French government bonds tracked the German market downwards, despite data
showing a surprisingly small rise in industrial production in March.
The decision by the Bank of France to leave its intervention rate unchanged
at its money market tender was fully expected and also failed to have an
impact on sentiment.
More important will be today's data on US producer prices and French
consumer prices. The French data could reinforce the picture of a low
inflation French economy and could help improve sentiment in the bond
market. Expectations centre around a rise of 0.2 per cent in May.
French industrial production rose by 0.2 per cent in March, below
expectations of a 0.4 per cent increase.
Sweden's National Debt Office has frozen plans to auction more of a
newly-launched 20-year index-linked bond, meaning it would not go ahead with
auctions for SKr4bn worth during this month to complete a previously-advised
issue programme, Reuters reports.
'We have put (the bonds) on ice for the time being,' a Debt Office spokesman
said. The office had said it would auction a total of SKr10bn worth of the
new zero coupon paper in May and June. In two auctions so far in this period
it offered SKr6bn but accepted bids for only SKr1.157bn.

FT  10 JUN 94 / International Capital Markets: Fund formed to invest in
insurance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JP Morgan and Marsh &amp; McLennan have raised Dollars 650m for investment in
underperforming insurance companies and new insurance ventures around the
world, including Lloyd's of London.
The scheme, in which each of the principals will invest around Dollars 40m
of its own money, closely resembles the Corsair fund, a limited partnership
put together by JP Morgan to invest in underperforming banks. The first
investment by that fund was in Banesto.
Mr Robert Clemens, chairman of Marsh &amp; McLennan Risk Capital, a subsidiary
of the US-based insurance broker, indicated that the Trident limited
partnership was intended to take advantage of structural changes under way
in the worldwide insurance industry.
'It is evident that the property/casualty business is beginning to undergo a
significant transformation, similar to what went on in commercial banking
over the last 20 years,' he said. The insurance industry is 'plagued by
inefficiency, and has the highest costs of any financial services business'.
Also, some insurers are weighed down by environmental and other risks for
which they do not have adequate reserves, making them uncompetitive with
newer companies which do not carry these burdens from the past, he said.
The fund will invest either in new insurance ventures, in companies that
need to be recapitalised, or in buy-outs of existing companies. It will take
an active part in the management of the companies it invests in.
Mr Clemens singled out Europe as a source of potential investments, given
that some national markets had been dominated by cartels until the passage
of single-market legislation recently. He added, though, that the US, which
accounts for around half of all property/casualty premiums, would inevitably
dominate.

The Province of Ontario's decision to play safe on the pricing of its first

When the bonds were freed to trade, the yield spread tightened in further to
65 basis points over US Treasuries from the launch spread of 67 basis
points. 'There is a fine line between getting no response from investors and
an overwhelming response, which makes this market difficult to call,' said
joint bookrunner Goldman Sachs.
Goldman added that the global bond structure also helped to arouse interest
in the offering. Nevertheless, the bulk of the bonds - around 60 per cent -
was from the US while European investors took up 30 per cent. The remainder
went to the Far East.
A similar demand split was detected for the CDollars 1bn five-year global
offering from Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp, the housing agency. The
bonds were priced to yield 16 basis points over Canadian treasuries and when
they were freed to trade the spread remained unchanged.
Signs that investors were coming out of the woodwork prompted further
dollar-denominated issuance. Syndicate managers said the European Investment
Bank's Dollars 500m five-year offering was in reasonable shape despite the
typically aggressive pricing of 10 basis basis points over Treasuries. When
the bonds were freed to trade, the spread widened only marginally to 12
basis points.
By contrast, the pricing on Unilever's Dollars 250m offering of 10-year
eurobonds was thought to be overly generous at 28 basis points over
Treasuries considering its triple-A rating and its wide following among
investors. Joint lead manager JP Morgan, which had sold out of bonds by
early afternoon, said the pricing reflected the widespread view that the
market was still tender, especially at the longer end.
Elsewhere, Eurofima and Sweden took advantage of arbitrage opportunities in
the euro-guilder sector to achieve enviable funding levels. ABN Amro, which
arranged both deals, noted that Sweden's Fl 250m five-year offering of
floating-rate notes represented the first such offering in the guilder
sector for two years.
In the international equities arena, the Dollars 100m issue of global
depositary receipts (GDRs) by Grasim Industries, one of India's leading
industrial companies, was priced at Dollars 20.50 per GDR, lead manager BZW
said. BZW is in the process of launching a Dollars 70m offering of GDRs for
Hocheng, Taiwan's leading toilet manufacturer.
The UK's Co-Operative Bank has set up a Pounds 400m euro MTN programme under
which it can issue ordinary and subordinated notes denominated in any
currency.

FT  10 JUN 94 / International Capital Markets: Argentina's debt underrated
by agencies, minister says
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The international credit rating agencies are underrating the quality of
Argentina's debt, Mr Domingo Cavallo, the country's economy minister, told a
conference in London yesterday.
'The rating for Argentinian bonds is very low compared to what it should
be,' he said. 'We have double-B-minus, the same as Venezuela, and Mexico has
double-B-plus. But if you look at the economic fundamentals and prospects,
Argentina is not different from Mexico. We should have double-B-plus,' he
said.
The bond market 'gives Argentina more or less the same rating as Mexico,' he
said, illustrated by the fact that Argentinian and Mexican yield spreads
over US bonds are very similar, and much tighter than Venezuelan yield
spreads.
All three countries have sub-investment grade ratings, although Mexico's
rating has long been expected to be raised to investment grade. However,
that has been delayed by political uncertainty.

FT  10 JUN 94 / International Company News: Investment yields fall at
Japan's life insurers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD BAKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Lower interest rates and weak overseas returns produced a substantial drop
in the investment yield at Japan's eight largest life insurance companies in
the year to the end of March.
Results published yesterday showed a decline of 0.5 per cent in the
companies' yields to an average of less than 4 per cent. The fall forced the
insurers to cut policyholder dividends for the fourth year in succession.
The companies blamed the global trend towards lower interest rates last year
and the sharp rise in the yen, which reduced profits from overseas
securities.
The decline in investment yield has heightened fears that most of the
companies are now technically unable to meet their liabilities to investors.
The life insurers are all mutual companies owned by their policyholders and
are the largest group of institutional investors in Japan.
In the late 1980s most companies wrote policies which guaranteed their
members greater returns on their assets than they have subsequently been
able to earn.
Most analysts believe the Japanese insurers need an investment yield of at
least 4.6 per cent to meet their liabilities. This figure is substantially
higher than yields achieved in the last few years.
But insurance law permits life insurance companies to count unrealised
profits on equity holdings as profits, without requiring them actually to
sell the shareholdings. All eight leading companies took advantage of the
rule in the last year.
Companies are now counting nearly Y11,000bn (Dollars 104.5bn) in hidden
equity gains as profits to bolster their capacity to meet their liabilities,
an increase of nearly 30 per cent on last year.
Income from premiums and new policies rose strongly in the second half of
the year, offsetting an unprecedented fall in the first six months, and
securing a 2.6 per cent increase for the eight insurers together. Total
assets rose by 8.4 per cent to more than Y130,000bn.
Several of the companies face additional difficulties with substantial
portfolios of bad debts.
One-third of Japanese insurers' assets are in the form of loans, and during
the so-called 'bubble economy' years of the late 1980s, some of them pursued
increasingly imprudent lending policies, and have since found themselves
burdened with large quantities of problem loans.
Worst hit was Sumitomo Life, whose chairman, Mr Yasuhiko Ueyama, is to
resign following the company's admission that its non-performing loans rose
by 32 per cent in the year to March.
Most of the loans were to Sumitomo Life's non-bank financial affiliates, a
lending policy actively encouraged by Mr Ueyama.
In a placatory gesture to disgruntled policyholders, most of the companies
also cut or kept unchanged executive bonuses that had already been reduced
in the previous year. Despite this, the divisible surplus fell by nearly 27
per cent to Y1,244bn.

<TEXT>
Western Mining Corporation, the large Melbourne-based mining group, said
yesterday that it was withdrawing from the Bulong Nickel Project in Western
Australia.
As a result, Resolute Resources, the smaller Perth-based miner which
previously had a 30 per cent interest in the project, will take a 100 per
cent ownership interest and management control.
Resolute said it was anxious 'to take full advantage of the expected upturn
in nickel prices'.
The project was established more than three years ago, to investigate the
viability a significant low-grade laterite nickel deposit, about 30km east
of Kalgoorlie in Western Australia.
In statement yesterday, WMC said that studies had suggested that it would be
more attractive to use a sulphur burning acid plant to process the deposits,
rather than to use sulphur dioxide off-gases from the WMC's nickel smelter
at Kalgoorlie.

<TEXT>
NEC, the Japanese electronics company, is to nearly triple its transactions
with Bull, in a move to support the lossmaking French computer company's
financial and business position.
NEC said that trading with Bull, which is a subsidiary of the French
state-owned Groupe Bull was being raised from an annual Y6bn to Y7bn to just
under Y20bn (Dollars 192m) in the current fiscal year.
As part of the increase in business between the two companies, NEC is
expected to supply Bull with telecommunications equipment and asynchronous
transfer mode (ATM) switches for digital transmissions in order to support
the French company's operations in Europe.
ATM switches, which support multimedia communications, are relatively new in
Europe and could provide Bull with a head start in this area, NEC said.
Bull, in turn, will provide NEC with software for networks, and other
systems.
NEC currently supplies Bull with mainframe computers on an original
equipment manufacture basis.
The decision to increase mutual business comes as Bull has been seeking to
refinance its operations. NEC also recently agreed to develop mainframe and
middle-range computers with Bull, in which it owns a 4.43 per cent stake.

South Korean commercial banks reported lower profitability in 1993, hit by
two cuts in interest rates and the increased burden of corporate taxes and
internal reserve requirements, according to the Office of Bank Supervision,
AP-DJ reports from Seoul.
In a report on the management of domestic banks, the banking regulatory body
said that their after-tax net profits amounted to Won889.1bn (Dollars 1.1bn)
in 1993, a 4.5 per cent decline on the previous year's Won931.4bn.
Combined operating income totalled Won2,900bn in 1993, up 11.6 per cent from
Won2,600bn.
Combined assets expanded by 18.6 per cent to Won198,490bn, slower than the
previous year's 19.9 per cent rise.
Bad debts, defined as debts on which payments on principal or interest are
more than six months overdue, totalled Won2,930bn at the end of 1993, up
20.9 per cent.
The annualised rise of such debts was the first since 1988. The bank blamed
some large bankruptcies, including Hanyang, a leading construction company.

A grouping of 18 eastern and southern African countries is planning to set
up a new stock exchange to help develop capital markets in the region,
Reuter reports from Harare.
An official from the Preferential Trade Area (PTA) grouping said the
exchange would allow cross-listing and trading in national securities, to
boost cross-border investment and capital mobility. He did not say where the
exchange would be located.
Zimbabwe welcomed the proposal, but said tight foreign exchange rules must
be removed first.
'It is a good idea to have such an establishment but exchange controls have
to be seriously addressed and relaxed before such an exchange could become
viable,' said Mr Mark Tunmer, head of Zimbabwe's stock exchange.
He said the proposed bourse could enable member-countries to raise funds for
development projects and allow cross-border investment.
The PTA official did not say where the bourse would be located, but analysts
believe a likely choice to be Harare, the Zimbabwean capital.

expects improvement

<TEXT>
James Hardie, the Australian building materials and investment group in
which Brierley Investments has taken a small stake, yesterday announced a 75
per cent fall in profits after tax and abnormals, to ADollars 14.2m
(USDollars 10.4m) in the year to end-March.
However, the company said it expected 'a very marked improvement' in the
current financial year.
Revenues in the 12 months rose to ADollars 1.72bn, compared with ADollars
1.6bn in the same period a year earlier. The comparable profits figure for
1992-93 was ADollars 56.5m (neither profit figure is equity-accounted).
Part of the tumble in profits derived from a larger abnormal item - ADollars
54.9m in 1993-94, compared with ADollars 10.4m in the previous year. About
half of the latest figure related to restructuring and rationalisation
efforts.
Even at the operating level, however, profits slipped to ADollars 54.9m from
ADollars 70.3m in the previous 12 months. On the building products side,
which accounted for most of the abnormal items, profits were up by one-fifth
to ADollars 66.9m, on a 5 per cent sales gain.
Hardie forecast a continued improvement at its US arm, which moved from a
loss of ADollars 10.9m in 1992-93 to a ADollars 6.2m profit last year. But
the pipelines business saw profits fall to ADollars 18.6m from ADollars 30m.
The group's building services division also recorded a loss of ADollars
5.1m, compared with last time's ADollars 6.6m profit, due to the decline in
non-housing construction in Australia and losses in New Zealand.
On an earnings per share basis, Hardie's profits equated to 3.9 cents,
compared with 15.8 cents last time. However, in the light of the board's
belief that the figures represented 'a turning point', the final dividend
was maintained at 6 cents a share, bringing the total for the year to 12
cents (fully franked), compared with 12 cents last time (70 per cent
franked).

FT  10 JUN 94 / International Company News: Rhone-Poulenc clarifies action
for US interest

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Rhone-Poulenc, the French chemicals group, yesterday said it would not take
any steps involving its 68 per cent interest in US drugs group Rhone-Poulenc
Rorer without first consulting the company's management.
Earlier this week, the US company's shares leapt on news that its French
parent was considering various options, including 'transactions relating to
business combinations, mergers or transfers of assets or securities'.
The stock market saw that statement, contained in a filing with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, as an indication that Rhone-Poulenc was
considering buying out the remainder of its US subsidiary's shares.
Yesterday, in another filing with the SEC, the French company laid out
consultation procedures it would go through if it planned to take any
action. The company said the timing of the latest filing was purely an
administrative matter, and had not been prompted by the reaction to its
first statement.
Rhone-Poulenc Rorer's shares, which had jumped from Dollars 33 3/8 before
the first filing to Dollars 38 5/8 on Tuesday, closed Dollars 2 down at
Dollars 35 5/8 on Wall Street yesterday.
When it acquired Rorer in 1990, Rhone-Poulenc signed a standstill agreement
under which it cannot increase its holding before the end of July 1997,
unless it first secures the support of a majority of the US company's
non-executive directors.
Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, which suffered slightly lower profits last year,
refused to comment yesterday, but referred questions to its French parent.
For 1993 the company made net profits of Dollars 408.7m, down about 5 per
cent on unchanged sales of Dollars 4.02bn.

FT  10 JUN 94 / International Company News: Zenith Data climbs back into the
ring - The French-controlled PC manufacturer could break even this year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tough controls on costs and quality together with a strategic collaboration
with Packard Bell are at the heart of a turnround at Zenith Data Systems
which suggests the French-owned personal computer manufacturer could break
even this year.
The company, formerly the computer arm of Zenith Electronics of the US, has
been a heavy loss maker since its its acquisition by Groupe Bull of France
in 1989.
Analysts have attributed a substantial part of Bull's FFr15bn (Dollars
2.64bn) losses over the past three years to problems at the Chicago-based
manufacturer, which until recently has been losing money on every personal
computer it made.
Now that the French government has made it clear that Groupe Bull is to be
privatised, the performance of its troubled personal computer arm has
assumed a new importance.
Mr Jacques Noels, chairman and chief executive since January 1993, says
there were three chief areas of concern when he took over.
First, quality. Returned systems and repairs cost the company some 20 per
cent of its Dollars 1bn revenues last year. Second, the lack of a line of
low-cost, entry-level systems. Third, profit-ability.
'Our financials were absolutely catastrophic,' he says without disclosing
the level of losses.
Mr Noels, 53, took over from Mr Enrico Pesatori, now vice-president of
worldwide sales and marketing for Digital Equipment, the US computer
manufacturer.
Mr Pesatori, also 53, had been brought in from Olivetti in 1991 to restore
ZDS's technological and market credibility after Bull ran into problems in
the early stages of bedding-in its US acquisition.
Mr Pesatori, an expansive and charismatic executive, successfully catalysed
the introduction of a new range of high-level personal computer and network
servers but departed for Digital before the manufacturing bugs had been
ironed out.
Mr Noels, quietly-spoken with a fastidious attention to detail, set out on a
'quality overkill' mission. Engineering and manufacturing practices were
overhauled in response to information about faults collated by ZDS field
staff. ZDS sales people were encouraged to join customers in opening the
cartons containing newly delivered systems: 'All sorts of things happen
during transportation,' Mr Noels says darkly.
The result has been, Mr Noels claims, a drastic improvement. Now the cost of
faulty systems is less than 2 per cent of sales. According to a survey
carried out in the US by the consultancy J. D. Power &amp; Associates, ZDS now
ranks third behind IBM and Apple and just ahead of Compaq in quality.
The problem of an entry level PC line was mainly solved by the decision last
year to buy a 19.9 per cent stake in Packard Bell of the US, the largest
supplier of low-cost personal computers to retail chains such as Sears,
Roebuck and Wal-Mart.
ZDS and Packard Bell develop and manufacture desk top computers jointly,
while ZDS, which made its name in portable computing, provides Packard Bell
with notebook computers.
According to Mr Noels, the combined purchasing power of ZDS and Packard Bell
is equal to that of Compaq. Furthermore, the deal gives ZDS access to 9,000
retail outlets in the US and to Packard Bell expertise in marketing
low-cost, low-margin systems.
Today, ZDS offers a complete product line from entry-level desktop systems
through notebooks and high end networks servers. A line of personal digital
assistants is in development. The overall cost of research and development
has been cut from 7 per cent of revenues to 2 1/2 per cent through the
association with Packard Bell.
Overall, sales, general and administrative costs together with research and
development expenses have been cut from 35 per cent in the middle of last
year to 14 per cent now, helped by a reduction of 200 in the company's
1,700-strong workforce.
The results can be seen in the company's results. Revenues are expected to
reach Dollars 1.3bn to Dollars 1.4bn this year, about a 30 per cent
improvement on the year before. In the first quarter, worldwide sales were
73 per cent on on the corresponding period last year, with especially strong
growth seen in North America. The loss was about Dollars 10m on Dollars 300m
of sales.
Mr Noels aim now is to establish ZDS as a global force in what he describes
as 'connected computing', the best way to network together machines from
both the same and other manufacturers.
A first step was the introduction this year of a workgroup server designed
in conjunction with the leading networking software supplier, Novell, to
make networking simple and affordable. It won a prize at CeBit, the computer
exhibition in Hanover, Germany.
The big prize for Mr Noels, however, remains to return ZDS to real and
sustained profitability.

<TEXT>
Mr Steven Spielberg, the Hollywood producer and director, is to collaborate
with Knowledge Adventure, a California multimedia software company, in
developing educational software for children.
Mr Spielberg has also invested in Knowledge Adventure, a privately-held
company which is best known for its 'Dinosaur Adventure' and 'Space
Adventure' titles that incorporate rich graphics and videos.
Terms of the investment were not revealed.
The collaboration brings one of Hollywood's best-known directors together
with a leader in the multimedia software field. Mr Spielberg's recent
successes include Jurassic Park and Schindler's List. He is renowned for his
use of new technology in film-making.
'I've been following the growth in the multimedia software industry with
great interest,' said Mr Spielberg. 'In particular, I've been impressed with
the work being done at Knowledge Adventure.'
Mr Spielberg's interest in the field of interactive computer software
reflects growing ties between Hollywood and Silicon Valley as the
entertainment and digital technology fields increasingly overlap.
Mr Spielberg said he has found common interests with Knowledge Adventure
founder and chairman Mr Bill Gross. 'Our sons are about the same age, and we
are both devoting our energies to creating great experiences for them. I'm
anxious to participate in innovative, enriching educational software,' said
Mr Spielberg.
Mr Spielberg is expected to be involved in developing a new line of software
products for Knowledge Adventure.
'I am thrilled to have Steven Spielberg involved,' said Mr Gross. 'I firmly
believe that great educational experiences can be as exciting and engaging
as entertainment.'

<TEXT>
A Canadian investment group has pulled out of the consortium planning to buy
financially troubled Air Jamaica from the island's government. The
purchasers say this will not affect the timetable for a takeover, which is
scheduled for July 1.
Cochrane Investments of Toronto, which was to have taken about a quarter of
the 70 per cent stake being bought by the Air Jamaica Acquisition Group for
USDollars 26.25m, could not agree with its partners on plans for the
airline's operations or capital structure.
'All parties agreed that it was in the best interests of the project that
the arrangements made with Cochrane be terminated,' said Mr Peter Rousseau,
chief negotiator for the purchasers.
The consortium is seeking a replacement, and appears set to reach an
agreement with Mr Gordon Stewart, one of the Caribbean's leading hoteliers.
Mr Stewart would not be drawn on whether he would become involved in the
deal.
The agreement with the consortium, first announced a month ago, will leave
the government with a 25 per cent stake in Air Jamaica, with 5 per cent
being offered to the company's employees.

FT  10 JUN 94 / International Company News: Three suits filed to block Times
Mirror cable deal
</HEADLINE>

   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Three law suits have been filed against Times Mirror, the US media group,
seeking to block the proposed sale of its cable television operations to Cox
Enterprises for Dollars 2.3bn.
Times Mirror said it was in the process of studying and evaluating the
complaints.
One of the suits, filed by a shareholder, raises objections to the terms of
the deal relating to Chandler family trusts. The Chandler family holds a 55
per cent controlling interest in Times Mirror.
Other Times Mirror shareholders will receive stock in Cox Cable, a
subsidiary of Cox Enterprises, as part of the proposed transaction. The
Chandler trusts, which are precluded from holding stock in Cox, will instead
receive a new non-voting preferred Times Mirror stock that will continue to
pay dividends of about Dollars 42.5m a year.
Times Mirror said this week that dividends paid to other shareholders would
be substantially reduced when the proposed transaction is completed, to
enable greater investment in digital media ventures.
Under the terms of the agreement with Cox, Times Mirror will also receive
Dollars 1.36m in cash through a debt swap arrangement.

FT  10 JUN 94 / International Company News: Aker profits cut to NKr41m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   OSLO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Aker, the Norwegian cement, building materials and oil and gas technology
group, yesterday reported four-month pre-tax profits had more than halved to
NKr41m (Dollars 5.7m) from NKr87m in the same period last year.
The fall was due mainly to the positive effect of exceptional items on 1993
figures.
The 1993 result was lifted by exceptional items of NKr112m. If this was
excluded, the pre-tax profit for the period would have been NKr66m.
Group sales were reduced by NKr294m to NKr5.28bn as operating profits fell
to NKr87m from NKr135m.
Aker blamed the fall in sales on a lower level of activity in the oil and
gas technology division.
The cement and building materials division plunged to a pre-tax loss of
NKr58m from a profit of NKr30m last year, as sales rose by NKr69m to
NKr1.75bn.
Aker said that the domestic construction and civil engineering market had
begun to show growth, activity in the UK was on the rise and there was
continued high activity in the international cement business.
The oil and gas technology division lifted pre-tax profit to NKr128m from
NKr105m, as sales dipped to NKr3.32bn from NKr3.66bn.
Aker warned that a continuing low oil price and postponement of development
projects was limiting development activity. The division had an order
reserve of NKr8.6bn at end-April, against NKr10bn at the end of 1993.
Norske Skog, the Norwegian pulp, paper and building materials producer,
reported four-month pre-tax losses narrowed to NKr63m (Dollars 8.75m) from
NKr92m in the same period last year. It forecast an improved result for the
year.
The group said demand for main products - pulp, printing paper, sawn timber
and board - had picked up and prices had firmed in western Europe and North
America as capacity utilisation rose.
Group sales increased by NKr346m to NKr2.71bn, but the advance was partly
offset by a rise of NKr205m to NKr2.4bn in operating expenses.
However, Norske Skog swung to an operating profit of NKr114m from a loss of
NKr20m last year.
The group cut losses in associated companies by nearly half to NKr28m,
mainly reflecting high productivity at Papeteries de Golbey's in France and
lower prices for waste paper, which meets about half of the mill's raw
materials needs.

FT  10 JUN 94 / International Company News: Baltica claim against ex-parent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY BARNES and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   COPENHAGEN, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Baltica Insurance, the Danish insurance company, is claiming up to DKr590m
(Dollars 91m) in compensation from its former parent, Baltica Holding, now
known as Gefion.
Baltica Insurance's claim arises because the former parent company last year
sold shares owned by Baltica Insurance in the French insurer, Victoire, for
DKr1bn. But the buyer - Victoire's parent, Suez - revealed it had paid
DKr1.36bn for the shares.
Baltica Insurance wants to know how the difference arose and believes it has
a claim against Gefion for at least DKr360m and up to DKr590m, according to
Gefion yesterday. Gefion rejects the claim.
The dispute is the latest twist in a long saga, which led to the collapse of
Baltica Holding last year, when it was rescued by a capital injection from
Den Danske Bank, the largest Danish bank. This left Gefion as a minority
shareholding in Baltica Insurance.
Baltica Holding's troubles were in part caused by a hostile raid by its
Danish rival Hafnia in 1991. Hafnia collapsed in 1992 and its insurance
business was taken over last year by Codan, the Danish insurance company.
Baltica Holding fought off Hafnia by bringing in Suez as a main shareholder.
Baltica Holding and Baltica Insurance acquired holdings in the French
companies. The French and Danish companies sold their stakes in each other
last year.
Suez will announce its decision on Victoire, its insurance unit, at its
shareholders' meeting on June 15, Mr Gerard Worms, chairman, said yesterday,
Reuter adds from Paris.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   AMSTERDAM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The partial flotation next week of Koninklijke PTT Nederland, the Dutch
telecommunications and postal company, is nearly three times oversubscribed,
with strong demand from foreign and domestic investors, lead manager ABN
Amro said yesterday.
With 138.15m shares on offer, investors had put in applications for about
390m shares by the time subscriptions closed early yesterday afternoon.
Allocation of shares will be determined over the weekend, with an
announcement expected on Monday, clearing the way for the first trading in
KPN shares on the Amsterdam stock exchange later that day.
The government, which offered small private investors a discount to
encourage broad participation in the issue, had said earlier that private
shareholders would receive unspecified preferential treatment in
allocations. Details must still be worked out by the banking syndicate, the
Dutch state and their advisers.
The flotation, which will raise a minimum of Fl 6.9bn (Dollars 3.7bn) for
the Dutch state and which values KPN at Fl 22.9bn, is the country's biggest
share launch.
The state is selling a 30 per cent stake in this first tranche, with a
second tranche scheduled to take place before the end of 1997.
The shares were priced at Fl 49.75 each on Monday. Private investors will
receive a discount of Fl 2.50 per share, up to a maximum of 75 shares.
The strong demand makes it likely that the banking syndicate will exercise
its option to buy an additional 20.7m shares over the next 30 days to meet
heavy demand.
This would raise a further Fl 1bn for the Dutch state.
ABN Amro declined to give a breakdown of demand, saying the precise number
of applications would not be known until today. However, the government's
aim has been to sell half of the shares at home and half overseas. It wanted
to encourage wide participation among private investors.
Experienced private investors began filing applications as soon as
subscriptions opened on Monday, but first-time share investors had tended to
wait until Wednesday to take part, the bank said.

gas group
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Aga, the Swedish industrial gas group, has taken a 35 per cent stake in
Balashiha Kislarodnyj Zavod (BKZ, Balashiha Oxygen Plant), one of Russia's
two largest industrial gas groups.
The group aims to become the majority owner in BKZ this summer and
eventually take full control.
It has acquired a majority stake in a gas company in Kaliningrad and has a
small operation in St Petersburg. It is looking at other opportunities,
including Lentechgas in St Petersburg, Russia's other big industrial gas
group.
BKZ has 360 employees and annual sales of SKr45m (Dollars 5.7m). It is the
largest industrial gas company in the Moscow area, with considerable
production and distribution capacity for oxygen, nitrogen and argon.
It is also the leading company in the former Soviet Union for ultra-pure
gases and gas mixtures.
Mr Lars Kallsater, an Aga vice-president, said the company had bought its
initial stake through a tender from a state property fund. The fund is left
with a 14 per cent holding, most of which is soon to be auctioned, with the
remaining 51 per cent held by the group's employees.
Mr Kallsater declined to say how much Aga had paid for the shares, but said
commitments to invest in plant equipment and modernisation had been as
important as price in the tender selection process. He said the main
challenge was to increase energy efficiency and supply modern air separation
capacity.
'We see the risks in Russia but also the opportunities. If there are
setbacks, it is relatively easy for us to reduce our activity and still
survive with this type of operation,' he said.
Aga has been an active investor in eastern Europe. Apart from Russia, it has
invested in the three Baltic states, Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic.

FT  10 JUN 94 / International Company News: Finnair returns to black for
year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Finnair, the Finnish state airline, has restored its dividend after
returning to the black in its latest financial year.
This was in spite of the Finnish recession and a slight fall in passenger
numbers.
Higher turnover, cost-cutting and lower financing costs helped the airline
report a profit after financial items of FM113m (Dollars 20.5m) in the year
to March 31, compared with a FM415m deficit the previous year.
A FM0.30 per share dividend is proposed.
Group turnover was 8 per cent higher at FM5.89bn, with a 17 per cent
increase in cargo and mail traffic helping to compensate for a 1.5 per cent
drop in passenger numbers. The gross margin doubled to FM582m, or 9.9 per
cent of turnover, compared with FM284.9m, or 5.3 per cent, a year earlier.
There was an operating profit of FM183m, against a FM105m loss.
The airline said it was cautious about prospects in 1994-95, in spite of an
upturn in domestic air transport demand after four years of decline. It
noted that intensified international competition had caused price cuts.
The Finnish government recently said it would seek parliamentary approval
for plans to cut state ownership in Finnair to as little as 50.1 per cent
from its current 72 per cent.

Fortis, the Dutch-Belgian financial services group, posted a 35 per cent
increase in net profits to Ecu109.7m (Dollars 95.4m) in the first three
months.
In insurance, pre-tax results rose by 19 per cent to Ecu132.9m, while
profits in the banking sector almost quadrupled to Ecu55.1m.
The group - jointly owned by Amev of the Netherlands and Groupe AG of
Belgium - said the sharp increase was attributable to successful operations
in most of Fortis' businesses.
The profit for Groupe AG, the insurance company, was BFr1.85bn (Dollars
54.5m) in the first quarter, up 35 per cent on the same period a year ago.
But Mr Maurice Lippens, president of Groupe AG, said full-year 1994 profit
growth for both Groupe AG and its joint venture Fortis was unlikely to reach
the high levels of the first quarter.
He added that profits for Groupe AG were high in the first quarter as costs
had been kept closely in line with last year's levels.
Profit per Groupe AG share rose by 35 per cent in the first three months of
the year to BFr54.3, from BFr40.2 in the same period of 1993.
Fortis announced that from yesterday, its two parent companies - Groupe AG
and Amev - would be known as Fortis AG and Fortis Amev respectively.

FT  10 JUN 94 / International Company News: PepsiCo shares hit as cola price
war breaks out in US
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Shares in PepsiCo, US maker of the soft drink Pepsi-Cola, lost 9 per cent of
their value by mid-session yesterday after the company shocked Wall Street
with news that a cola price war had broken out in its domestic market.
By early afternoon, PepsiCo had fallen Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 31 1/2 while
Coca-Cola dropped Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 41 1/8 .
The company warned that second-quarter profits would be flat because of the
inroads being made into the US cola market by Cott, the fast-growing
Canadian maker of low-cost, store-branded foods and drinks.
Cott recently sparked a row in the UK by supplying J. Sainsbury, the
country's biggest retailer, with a store-branded cola that looks and tastes
similar to Coca-Cola but sells at roughly half the price. Coca-Cola accused
Sainsbury of trying to pass off Cott's product as 'the real thing'.
PepsiCo's announcement left investors worried because it called to mind last
year's 'Marlboro Friday', when Philip Morris, US manufacturer of Marlboro
cigarettes, slashed prices in response to cut-price competition.
The development also reinforced worries on Wall Street about the true worth
of brands at a time when value-conscious consumers seem inclined to switch
away from famous-name products if they feel they can get the same quality
from an unbranded product at a lower price.
Cott is the largest supplier of store-branded soft drinks in North America.
It is a big manufacturer of beer, iced tea, juices, snacks and pet food.
Stores that buy its products either put their own name on the label or one
of Cott's - notably, President's Choice.
The company has begun to spread outside North America to South Africa and
Australia, and signed an agreement with Cadbury Schweppes of the UK that
should allow it to distribute its products throughout Europe.
Mr John Maxwell, analyst at brokers Wheat First Butcher &amp; Singer, said Cott
had signed up 65 store chains in the US and was already supplying 55.
PepsiCo was being hurt more than Coca-Cola because PepsiCo owned the
companies that bottled its products, he said, 'and it's the bottlers who are
taking it on the chin'.

FT  10 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Proteus in development talks with nine
companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Proteus International, the USM-quoted drug designer, is in talks with nine
pharmaceuticals companies over development programmes in the immune system
and in treating arthritis.
Five large pharmaceutical companies are interested in its Adjuvant immune
system booster for use with vaccines, with commercial arrangements possible
next year.
Talks with one US and three Japanese companies about a technology to
stimulate cartilage growth which could reduce the need for surgery in
arthritis victims are at a preliminary stage. The conclusion of at least one
set of discussions is likely this financial year, said Mr Kevin Gilmore,
executive chairman.
The company already has collaborations with four other companies in human
and animal health including American Home Products and UK company Medeva.
Proteus also reported results for the year to March 31 which showed research
and administrative spending rising from Pounds 3.93m to Pounds 6.47m as
potential products progressed through their development programmes.
As with many young biotechnology companies, sales were zero, against Pounds
21,000, and pre-tax losses rose from Pounds 3.55m to Pounds 6.62m. Losses
per share rose from 13.52p to 24.36p.
Just after the March 31 year end, the company completed a 1-for-7 rights
issue at 284p. The proceeds raised the net cash position from Pounds 1.6m at
the year end to about Pounds 12m. The shares rose yesterday by 7p to 208p.
Mr Gilmore said that all of the 30 drug development programmes were ahead of
the schedule set out in the rights issue offer document.
'Modest revenues are anticipated to commence during 1994-5,' he said. Sales
would grow 'to provide a base for substantial expansion in 1996-7'.
The company's strategy is to develop new drugs and to licence them to
companies for the late stages of development, manufacture and marketing.

FT  10 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Widney in black and dividend forecast
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Widney, the broadly-based mechanical and electronic engineering group,
announced a turnround from a first-half loss of Pounds 417,000 to a Pounds
638,000 pre-tax profit and predicted a return to the dividend list this year
after a four year absence.
Mr David Cassidy, chairman, explained that the dividend decision followed
the clearing of preference dividend arrears, covering the period from July
1989 to December 1993, and amounting to Pounds 754,000.
He said that with the debit balance on the parent company's P and L account
cleared, ordinary dividends were now possible.
Second-half results were expected to continue the progress shown in the
first half, he added.
Turnover for the six months to April 2 grew to Pounds 15.23m (Pounds 9.88m).
Interest costs fell to Pounds 137,000 (Pounds 314,000) as a result of lower
rates and borrowings, while earnings per share came to 0.41p (0.91p losses).
The shares rose 1 1/2 p to 11 3/4 p yesterday.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The improvement seen in the first half continued into the second at Osborne
&amp; Little, the wallpaper and fabrics group, and enabled it to report pre-tax
profits of Pounds 2.6m for the year to March 31. There were losses of Pounds
98,000 last time.
Turnover amounted to Pounds 20.7m (Pounds 17.9m) and the pre-tax result last
time was after a Pounds 1.2m loss on the disposal of discontinued
operations.
Earnings per share of 26.44p (8.12p losses) were helped by the company
buying in a further 300,000 of its shares for cancellation, in addition to
the 705,000 bought in March 1993. It intends to purchase a further 600,000
if earnings can be expected to be further enhanced.
A proposed final dividend of 4p (2.6p) lifts the total to 6.5p (4.6p).

FT  10 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Martin Shelton doubles to Pounds 796,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Martin Shelton Group, the USM-quoted diaries, calendars and betting office
supplies maker, announced a near doubling of pre-tax profits from Pounds
407,000 to a record Pounds 796,000 for the year to March 31.
Mr Paul Martin, chairman, said the stronger performance from all areas of
group activity had been coupled with increased manufacturing output and
tighter production controls to restrict costs. Most growth had come from the
core activity - diaries, calendars and business gifts.
Turnover improved to Pounds 5.93m (Pounds 5.02m). A proposed final dividend
of 2.5p (1.5p) lifts the total to 3.75p (2.25p), payable from earnings per
share of 10.58p (5.73p).

<TEXT>
Care UK, the restructured nursing homes group, swung from losses of Pounds
2.36m to profits of Pounds 6.35m pre-tax for the half year to end-March,
thanks mainly to a Pounds 7.05m profit on the sale of its sheltered housing
division.
Turnover totalled Pounds 7.51m (Pounds 8.35m) of which Pounds 3.51m (Pounds
5.19m) related to discontinued operations. Operating profits of the
continuing activities emerged at Pounds 563,000 (losses Pounds 32,000), but
interest costs accounted for Pounds 789,000 (Pounds 851,000).
Undiluted earnings per share worked through at 3.31p. The USM-traded company
was formerly known as Anglia Secure Homes.

FT  10 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Field rises 14.7% to Pounds 13.7m - Signs
of economic recovery begin to show through
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Field Group, the carton maker which went public in July last year, raised
underlying pro forma pre-tax profits by 14.7 per cent to Pounds 13.7m in the
year to April 3, helped by an acquisition.
The gain was in spite of pricing pressures and scant market growth.
In 1993 profits were depressed by a property write-down of Pounds 1.95m and
a Pounds 1.25m charge for the termination of hedging instruments from the
management buy-out. Without adjusting for the flotation and including these
exceptional items, pre-tax profits were up from Pounds 3.38m to Pounds
8.95m.
The shares, floated at 250p, rose 7p to 250p yesterday.
Mr Keith Gilchrist, chief executive, said Field had outperformed the market
and raised its UK market share from 15.4 per cent to 16.6 per cent.
He expected further rationalisation in the market, with a number of
middle-sized players currently up for sale. Field could be interested in
buying at the right price, but preferred expansion in northern Europe, he
said.
Mr Gilchrist added that pressure from supermarkets had kept down prices of
packaging for foods, detergents and tissues. However, these accounted for
only a third of group turnover.
Although cautious on current year prospects, the chief executive said there
were now signs of economic recovery and he expected continued progress
helped by Pounds 20m of capital expenditure in the last two years.
Group sales rose 11.4 per cent to Pounds 155m, including Pounds 6.63m from
the Boots Print business acquired just after the float.
Operating profits, before exceptionals, rose by 11.7 per cent to Pounds
14.1m, including Pounds 550,000 from acquisitions. Mr David Nussbaum,
finance director, said that like-for-like growth, excluding the acquisition,
exchange rate movements and allowing for 1993 being a 53 week period, was
8.1 per cent.
Operating margins were unchanged at 9.1 per cent.
The interest charge fell from Pounds 646,000 to Pounds 357,000, with the
group ending the year with net cash of Pounds 4.2m. A lower tax rate, of 22
1/2 per cent, boosted earnings per share by 27 per cent to 17.9p, before
exceptionals.
Mr Nussbaum said the tax rate would rise to around 30 per cent over the next
four or five years.
A final dividend of 4.75p is proposed to give a total of 7.05p, up 10.2 per
cent on the notional 6.4p for 1993. Mr Gilchrist stressed the rise reflected
the strong balance sheet and low tax rate, and this sort of dividend
increase could not be expected every year.

FT  10 JUN 94 / UK Company News: GWR jumps to Pounds 930,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GWR, now the UK's second largest commercial radio group, is pressing for the
abolition of the present limit on the number of licences an operator can
hold.
The company - which yesterday announced a big jump in interim pre-tax
profits from Pounds 317,000 to Pounds 930,000 - already holds 20 licences -
the maximum permitted.
Under existing rules a radio company can no longer expand if it has more
than 15 per cent of commercial radio as defined by a points system or more
than 20 licences.
The Radio Authority, the industry regulatory body, has also told the
government that it wants to see the licence ceiling abandoned.
Mr Henry Meakin, chairman, said after the current government review of
cross-media ownership rules was completed and the recommendations published
it 'should enable the group to continue expanding its portfolio of wholly
owned stations in the UK.'
GWR has now added radio stations in East Anglia to its main base in the
south of England and the Midlands stations acquired in January.
The USM-quoted group is raising the interim dividend to 5.5p (4p).
The result primarily reflects a good performance by GWR South where both
national and local advertising revenues showed growth of 31 per cent.
Group turnover expanded from Pounds 4.1m to Pounds 7.8m with the Midlands
stations contributing Pounds 2.2m. Earnings per share were 14.1p (6.8p).

FT  10 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Half of accountancy firms report an
absolute decline in fee income levels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Accountancy firms are still languishing in the after-effects of the
recession, according to the Financial Times league table of the top 30 firms
published today.
Nearly half of the firms reported absolute declines in fee income levels,
while only three were able to report revenue growth in double digits.
The data shows the enormous and growing gulf between the 'Big Six' firms and
the rest of the market. Touche Ross, which fell to sixth place with a
decline of 0.8 per cent to Pounds 332.9m, remains more than three times the
size of the next largest firm.
Total income to the 30 largest accountancy practices was Pounds 3.4bn in
1993-94, up by less than 2 per cent on the previous year. The proportion
taken up by the largest six firms edged up marginally to 76 per cent.
The largest growth came from Latham, Crossley &amp; Davis, a small firm which
reported an 18 per cent rise to Pounds 9.7m in the year to April 30. The
biggest decline came from Littlejohn Frazer, down 13.5 per cent to Pounds
9m.
At the top end of the league table, Andersen, comprising Arthur Andersen and
Andersen Consulting, moved up from sixth place two years ago to become the
third largest firm in the country this year.
The table also shows the diversification of the accounting firms from purely
accounting and auditing work into tax, insolvency and management consulting.
However, many firms reported declines in insolvency income, which had
sustained them during the recession but has now fallen in line with the
number of business failures.
Two of the firms with strong specialisms now show less than one-fifth of
their income from audit and accounting work. These are Andersen, because of
Andersen Consulting, and Smith &amp; Williamson, with its heavy banking and
investment management service. Levy Gee, an insolvency specialist, reports
only 37 per cent from accounting.
The trend to cutting jobs continued, with the number of partners across the
firms reduced to just over 4,700 down 7 per cent from last year, and the
number of other professional staff down 6 per cent to a little under 41,000.
The figures are prepared for comparison with most firms providing
information for financial year-ends to March or April, although these do not
always correspond to their own year-ends for internal use.
It remains difficult to compare the firms for a number of reasons, including
the fact that a number of the smaller accountancy practices are affiliations
rather than single firms.
For this reason, Moores Rowland has for the first time been shown adjusted
to exclude its MRI associates, which lowers its place in the rankings. On a
like-for-like basis, it remains 16th in the league.

FT  10 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Property revaluation leaves 600 Group
Pounds 2.5m in the red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A loss on a property revaluation pushed the 600 Group, which manufactures
and distributes machine tools and materials handling equipment, into a wider
deficit last year despite a reduced loss at the operating level.
The group, which has undergone a substantial reorganisation, reported
pre-tax losses of Pounds 2.5m for the year to March 31 compared with losses
of Pounds 2.39m. The result was after a Pounds 1.02m loss on the revaluation
of properties.
Turnover fell by 2.5 per cent to Pounds 96.7m (Pounds 99.2m), but the
decline masked modest signs of improvement in the second half when group
sales increased by 15 per cent reflecting improved demand, particularly in
North Amer-ica.
Professor Michael Wright, chairman, said, 'after five years, during which
our performance has been dogged by recession in our major markets, we are
beginning to detect clear signs of recovery in demand.'
Similarly at the operating level results improved from a first half loss of
Pounds 1m to a profit of Pounds 800,000 in the second half producing a
reduced full year operating loss, before the property revaluation, of Pounds
157,000 (Pounds 1.26m).
Prof Wright said the reduced operating loss reflected a combination of a
moderate improvement in demand and the successful launch of new products
from the group's machine tool, laser and electro-optic businesses.
Net interest costs edged down to Pounds 1.28m (Pounds 1.3m) although net
borrowings at the year-end were higher at Pounds 10.6m (Pounds 9m)
representing gearing of 22 per cent (16 per cent).
Two percentage points of the gearing increase was associated with a Pounds
5.5m reduction in shareholders' funds because of the property revaluation.
Losses per share were 6.5p (5.9p). However, the board said it was encouraged
by the second half improvement and the final dividend is maintained at 1p,
making a reduced total of 1.5p, against 2p.

Despite an increase in stock write-downs Caffyns, the motor dealer, reported

Turnover increased to Pounds 150.9m (Pounds 123.9m). Operating profits moved
ahead to Pounds 1.7m (Pounds 1.42m) and the pre-tax result was helped by
lower interest charges of Pounds 993,000 (Pounds 1.16m).
Earnings per share advanced to 14.7p (0.8p) and the dividend is held at

Losses in its restaurants division left the pre-tax deficit at Pounds
246,073 at Bristol Scotts for the 1993 year, against losses of Pounds 2.58m.
The property and leisure group has decided to close the division and since
the year end two outlets have been sold and the third will be closed next
month.
Mr Anthony Kerman, chairman, said the moves would eliminate the losses in
the second half of the present year allowing the group to benefit fully from
the positive contributions expected from the remaining divisions.
Turnover for the year fell from Pounds 10.1m to Pounds 8.7m, most of the
fall being the result of the restaurants disposals. Losses per share were
3.81p (45.43p).

FT  10 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Court's decision hits Heath
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CE Heath, the insurance broker, yesterday said it would be taking an
exceptional charge of about Pounds 22.75m in its next accounts following a
ruling against it in the Australian courts.
The action was triggered by a judgment in the Supreme Court of Victoria on
June 8 upholding an appeal from the state Accident Compensation Commission
which overturned decisions in lower courts and took the company by surprise.
The share price fell by 24p on news of the announcement, which came days
before the company's results are expected for the 12 months to March 31.
Mr Peter Presland, chief executive, said: 'This has come as a bit of a
shock. We have decided that prudence dictates we take it on the chin.'
The award relates to litigation against CE Heath Underwriting and Insurance
(Australia), a wholly-owned subsidiary, and other insurers, which wrote
workers' compensation business in Victoria during the early 1980s.
Mr Presland said the decision of the court was 'quite amazing and
incomprehensible' and did not take into account the earlier judgments
following initial hearings in March 1990. He said it was not possible to
appeal further.
The company had noted the existence of the Australian litigation in accounts
over several years, but had not up till now expected to lose the judgment.

FT  10 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Scapa edges ahead to Pounds 48.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits of Scapa Group, the supplier of consumable products to the
paper industry, edged 3 per cent ahead from Pounds 47m to a record Pounds
48.5m for the year ended March 31.
Mr Harry Tuley, chairman, said there were signs that the paper industry 'is
on a fragile recovery path from a very depressed base.' But he also pointed
to the 'increasingly significant results' of the group's industrial
materials division, which would provide an alternative route to earnings
growth.
Turnover rose by almost 13 per cent from Pounds 347.3m to Pounds 391.7m.
About 80 per cent of the group's products are made or sold overseas, and
currency factors accounted for Pounds 11m of the increase. A further Pounds
16.2m arose from acquisitions.
Operating profits increased by Pounds 3.8m to Pounds 55.5m. However,
currency gains accounted for Pounds 2.9m of the advance and Pounds 1.8m came
from acquisitions.
The group generated a positive cash flow of Pounds 17.3m, up from Pounds
4.3m. Capital expenditure at Pounds 19.7m was the lowest since 1987 - Mr
Tuley said the group felt it had enough capacity and was being cautious. He
expected it to return to the recent average of Pounds 25m in the current
year.
The paper and related industries division reported profits of Pounds 41.4m
on turnover of Pounds 229.2m, up from Pounds 40.4m on Pounds 208.3m. The US
market - Scapa's biggest - took higher physical volumes, but prices remained
under pressure.
The industrial materials division lifted operating profits from Pounds 11.3m
to Pounds 14.1m, and sales from Pounds 139m to Pounds 162.5m.
The division includes speciality adhesive tapes, sales of which are now more
than Pounds 75m following the acquisitions of Saba and Barnier in France.
The group is searching for further acquisitions, probably in North America,
'to build on the critical mass now established.'
Net interest payable rose from Pounds 4.7m to Pounds 7m.
Earnings per share were 13.5p, down from 13.8p, and a final dividend of
4.23p (4.03p) is proposed, taking the total to 5.88p (5.63p).
COMMENT
The shares reacted to slightly lower than expected profits with an 11p fall
to 214p. The company's cautious statement could prove to be a little too
gloomy, although there is likely to be a time lag before any improvement in
the paper industry itself feeds through to the suppliers. Nevertheless, it
has increased its market share of paper industry supplies and maintained
profits throughout the recession, putting itself in a strong position to
benefit from any recovery. Profits this year of about Pounds 54m give a
prospective multiple approaching 15 - a solid hold.

FT  10 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Cost cutting behind 25% rise at Chubb to
Pounds 77.14m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cost cutting at Chubb Security enabled the electronic alarm and locks group
to achieve a 25 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 77.14m for
the year to end-March.
The improvement in profits, from last year's Pounds 61.75m, was scored from
a turnover just 1 per cent ahead at Pounds 701m (Pounds 688m). The shares
fell 25p to 335p, reflecting concerns over the level of sales growth.
The UK and Asia Pacific markets produced strong growth, but the US and
Europe were affected by a downturn in sales, primarily in their fire systems
business.
The figures were affected by currency movements and an accounting policy
change on currency translation. This reduced turnover by Pounds 12m and
pre-tax profits by Pounds 1m.
Mr David Peacock, chief executive, said sales for the first two months of
the current year were on target, and were 'meaningfully ahead' of the
previous year.
Since the company demerged from Racal in October 1992, management has
focused on boosting both market share and reducing costs.
Last year, the company made around 500 redundancies worldwide but overall
redundancy and reorganisation costs fell Pounds 3.4m to Pounds 4.9m, and the
pace of restructuring should slow.
Operating profits from the group's electronic security division rose 13 per
cent to Pounds 41.78m, with profit margins improving from 10.8 per cent to
11.8 per cent.
On the physical security side, profits grew 21 per cent to Pounds 36.57m and
margins from 8.8 per cent to 10.5 per cent.
Chubb is investing Pounds 8m in plant equipment in the current year, and
plans to introduce 16 new product ranges and expand its sales force in a
push to increase market share.
It is also developing in emerging markets. Sales in China grew to Pounds 34m
last year, and Chubb is expanding its sales presence there. This should help
make up for continuing weakness in the US and European markets, where sales
fell Pounds 7.7m last year.
At the year end, Chubb had built up a net cash position of Pounds 35.3m.
A recommended final dividend of 4.25p makes a 6.25p (4.75p) total. Earnings
amounted to 16.4p (12.47p).
COMMENT
Chubb came out with a good set of results, but the problem it now faces is
how to deliver more. It has relatively mature markets, and a level of
efficiency which is getting harder to improve. The push into new markets,
combined with the upturn in western economies, should help it achieve
pre-tax profits of about Pounds 90m in the current year. This puts the
shares on a p/e ratio of 17.3, even after today's fall. On those
expectations, it seems unlikely to continue outperforming the market.

FT  10 JUN 94 / UK Company News: AGM told HTV makes good start to year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Louis Sherwood, chairman of HTV, told shareholders at the annual meeting
yesterday that the year had started very well for the ITV broadcaster to
Wales and the west of Eng-land.
In the five months to the end of May airtime sales revenue rose by more than
10 per cent, against 7.5 per cent growth for ITV as a whole.
Its share of total ITV revenue had now risen to more than 6.1 per cent
compared with 5.9 per cent.
Mr Sherwood was still taking a cautious view of the full year but said: 'I
must reiterate that we are feeling very positive about every aspect of our
business.'
He also called for a new broadcasting act to deal with the anomalies of the
1990 legislation.
At the meeting the company spelled out the progress made since the alliance
was announced with Flextech and its parent organisation, United Artists
European Holdings, which in turn is part of Tele-Communications of the US.
A Pounds 2m contract for 20 months has already been signed to provide

FT  10 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Oxford Instruments up 21%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A recovery in demand for its products helped Oxford Instruments, the
advanced instrumentation group, report a 21 per cent increase in full-year
pre-tax profits yesterday.
For the 12 months to March 27 profits increased to Pounds 12.8m (Pounds
10.6m) pre-tax. The advance was achieved on turnover up by 11 per cent to
Pounds 112m (Pounds 101.1m) reflecting a 22 per cent rise in new orders to
Pounds 117m.
Some 85 per cent of group sales were made overseas with Japanese sales
growing particularly strongly - mostly reflecting volume growth.
Earnings per share increased by 13 per cent to 17p (15p), reflecting a
slightly higher tax charge of 35.5 per cent (31.6 per cent).
A proposed final dividend of 3.4p (3.1p), makes an increased total of 4.9p
(4.5p).
The shares closed up 27p at 307p.
Mr Peter Williams, chairman and chief executive, said, 'while it is too
early to talk of long-term sustained recovery in all our markets, orders
nevertheless rose in the majority of our businesses although patient
monitoring and nuclear measurement continued to experience rather more
difficult trading conditions.'
Operating profits more than doubled, from Pounds 3.46m to Pounds 7.19m, with
the group's core businesses in superconductivity continuing to make the main
contribution to profits.
Income from the group's 49 per cent stake in Oxford Magnetic Technology, the
MRI scanner joint venture with Siemens, slipped to Pounds 5.14m (Pounds
6.05m). Despite the decline, OMT shipped more than 300 magnets last year,
and Mr Williams said it represented 'another excellent profit performance.'
Interest income fell to Pounds 457,000 (Pounds 1.1m), however the strong
cash flow in the second half boosted net cash to Pounds 7.9m, which was
slightly higher than a year earlier.
COMMENT
Oxford managers decided to use most of the benefits of currency movements to
trim prices and boost market share last year and one effect was to boost
sales per employee by 13 per cent to Pounds 80,400. Profit margins widened
from 3.4 to 6.4 per cent but still lag way behind their historic high of 18
per cent. Improving demand should help boost margins back towards these
levels, although some businesses, particularly patient monitoring, remain
sluggish and very competitive. Meanwhile the group is hopeful a buyer will
be found for its second Dollars 25m (Pounds 16m) synchrotron - its has spent
Pounds 6.8m on construction so far. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 14.8m look
possible producing earnings of 20.1p this year. Given the growth prospects,
the shares probably deserve to be trading on a higher forward multiple than
the 15.3 they currently command.

FT  10 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Johnson Matthey falls 11% - Shares lose 28p
as costs of Italian silver disposal hit results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The cost of disposing of its Italian silver business helped to push 1993-94
profits down by 11 per cent at Johnson Matthey, the precious metals
technology group. The shares fell 28p to close at 558p.
Pre-tax profits were Pounds 65.4m on total turnover of Pounds 1.96bn for the
year to end March, compared with a previous Pounds 73.8m on turnover of
Pounds 1.85bn.
However, continuing activities showed operating profits rose by 15 per cent
to Pounds 81.6m (Pounds 70.8m) on turnover of Pounds 1.84bn (Pounds 1.76bn).
Mr David Davies, chairman and chief executive, said all four divisions had
shown higher profits. At the same time the group had embarked on several
joint ventures which would enable it to expand globally.
The group was moving from the cost cutting cycle of the past few years into
a cycle of growth, he said, citing the group's ceramics venture with
Cookson, planned autocatalyst plants in Malaysia and Mexico, and an
electronics venture with Mitsubishi in Japan.
The improvement at operating level was fuelled by the materials technology
division, which lifted profits from Pounds 20.8m to Pounds 28m. Mr Davies
said that biomedical products had continued to be a good profits earner, and
the electronic materials side had lifted profits in North America by 60 per
cent in sterling terms.
Profits at the automotive catalysts division rose from Pounds 27.1m to
Pounds 28.2m, with strong demand from North America offsetting a 15 per cent
decline in the European car market.
Precious metals profits edged ahead from Pounds 20.5m to Pounds 20.8m. A
rise in the price of platinum from Pounds 215 a troy ounce to Pounds 255 in
the period was offset by a further fall in the rhodium price, from Pounds
1,253 a troy ounce to Pounds 625.
The colour and print division improved profits from Pounds 11.3m to Pounds
13m.
Exceptional charges totalled Pounds 11.7m, compared with an exceptional gain
of Pounds 3.7m previously.
The book loss of Pounds 9m on the Italian sale, announced yesterday, was
offset by the disposal earlier in the year of the UK and Irish jewellery
businesses at a profit of Pounds 2.3m. A provision of Pounds 5m has been
charged for restructuring costs on Cookson Matthey Ceramics, the joint
venture with Cookson announced last March. and due to start on July 1.
Earnings per share were 23.7p, down from 27.1p. Earnings before exceptionals
were 27.6p. A final dividend of 8p is proposed, giving a total for the year
of 11.4p (10.3p).
COMMENT
The fall in the share price was surprising. Apart from the sale of the
Italian business, the results were in line with City expectations. Further
growth is expected. The group is investing a lot of money in the future.
Capital expenditure, at Pounds 65.4m, was more than twice the depreciation
charge, and research and development spending at Pounds 28.5m was also at a
record. It is taking its electronics expertise to Japan and its autocatalyst
expertise to east Asia and Mexico. By linking with Cookson, it is turning
the small colour and print division into a business big enough to compete on
global terms in the ceramics industry. Next year profits should be about
Pounds 90m, which gives a multiple of more than 17. This might look
expensive in the short term, but longer term the prospects are good.

FT  10 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Gt Southern faces Pounds 87m bid from US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Service Corporation International, the largest operator of funeral homes and
cemeteries in the US, has set its sights on the UK, through an Pounds 87m
takeover bid for Great Southern Group.
SCI, which buries one in nine people in the US, has already expanded into
Canada and Australia and it is now attempting its first foray into the UK.
Great Southern, the third largest funeral director in the UK, look set to
reject the bid. Mr Barry Field, a director, described the bid as 'totally
unacceptable'.
Mr Field is chairman of JD Field, which controls 56 per cent of Great
Southern's shares. If his decision stands, it will be almost impossible for
the current bid to succeed.
Mr Bill Heiligbrodt, SCI's president and chief operating officer, said his
company was offering a high price for a business, which it intended to use
as a springboard for aggressive expansion into the highly fragmented UK
funerals market.
'My job is to become the biggest and most successful player in every market
where I operate', said Mr Heiligbrodt. But he was adamant that SCI had no
intention of changing the face of British burials. 'We want to maintain UK
traditions,' he said.
The SCI offer was pitched 26 per cent above Wednesday's closing share price,
but the board of Great Southern urged shareholders 'not to take any action'.
Mr Field said Great Southern had fought off an unwanted bid from Amalgamated
Tobacco back in 1959, and would provide good reasons why the current bid did
not represent fair value.
However, it faces a formidable opponent. SCI was set up by Mr Robert
Waltrip, who inherited a funeral home in Houston 32 years ago. He is still
chairman.
Mr Waltrip transformed the US burying business through the development of a
full service industry; as a spokesman said 'as long as its legal and in good
taste, we will try to do what the family wants.'
He has also recently attempted to elevate the status of the entire industry,
by setting up the Americal Funeral Service Museum, in Houston.
SCI has 843 funeral homes, 201 cemeteries and related businesses in 50
states, along with Canada and Australia, and it made Dollars 101m (Pounds
67m) net profit last year, compared with Great Southern's after tax profit
of Pounds 4m.
The company is keen to build up economies of scale by expanding Great
Southern, which has about 4.5 per cent of the funeral market.
SCI is offering 600p per share, compared with Wednesday's closing price of
475p. Yesterday Great Southern's shares closed up 133p at 608p.
It is also offering 239p per convertible share. Mr Heiligbrodt said that
upon conversion, the Field stake would fall below 50 per cent.

FT  10 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Maurice Saatchi accepts move to performance
pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Maurice Saatchi, chairman of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, one of the world's
largest advertising groups, yesterday renounced his five-year rolling
contract, worth Pounds 625,000 a year, as part of a move to
performance-related pay for its top executives.
Mr Saatchi told the group's annual meeting that he was leading by example in
his move to a three-year fixed-term contract at a base salary of Pounds
200,000 a year.
Additional bonuses will be based on revenue growth and he will also take
part in a new performance-related share option scheme which is due to come
up for approval at an extraordinary general meeting in the next few months.
Mr Saatchi has foregone about half of his entitlement under his contract in
recent years.
Mr Charles Scott, chief executive, said the company was enjoying the best
period of new business in the past four years.
'Revenue growth is essential to the company, and this encouraging trend is
an early tangible sign that our operating performance is at last improving.'
The group returned to profitability in 1993 for the first time since 1988,
with pre-tax profits of Pounds 19.2m. However, if currency movements are
taken into account, revenue for 1993 was flat.
Mr Scott said revenues in 1994 were now expected to be higher than budgeted,
although still significantly lower than last year. However, profits would
still be higher than 1993 because of cost reductions.
'I am now able to say with confidence that I believe we are on the road to
recovery,' he added.
The shares rose 8p to close at 141p.
Mr Saatchi's new fixed-term contract was met with approval by shareholders
at the meeting who also questioned the chairman about the conflict between
himself and Mr Scott which surfaced in the press earlier this year.
Mr Saatchi said there was a 'capacity for tension' between the roles of
chairman and chief executive in any company. The tension had been resolved
and had had a 'cathartic effect'.
It was also announced yesterday that all board members would stand for
re-election every year, instead of the present three years.

FT  10 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Optimistic Pilkington strongly ahead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The beginning of recovery in its markets, cost cutting and strong cash flow
lifted pre-tax profits at Pilkington by 57.4 per cent to Pounds 72.4m in the
year to March 31 before an exceptional profit on disposals of Pounds 25.4m.
Sir Antony Pilkington, chairman, said there was now 'cause for some optimism
for the future' at the glass group. The total dividend was unchanged at 4p,
with a 2.5p second interim payment, although earnings per share excluding
exceptionals were 2p (losses 1.9p).
He also announced the postponement of the flotation of 49 per cent of the
group's Australian operations because of indigestion in the new issue market
there. The group will look at the situation again in the autumn.
Mr Roger Leverton, chief executive, said the emphasis was now changing from
cost cutting and cash conservation to improving margins. He hoped margins
could be increased to around 10 per cent, although this would take two or
three years. The restructuring of the group was largely complete, he said,
following a number of disposals.
Pilkington, which had recorded annual profits above Pounds 300m before the
recession, has cut costs by Pounds 200m a year over the last three years, Mr
Leverton said. Another Pounds 70m or Pounds 80m of costs would go in the
current year. The group's base business workforce had been cut by 20 per
cent over the last three years. During 1993-94 1,700 jobs went and a further
1,300 were planned to go in the current year.
Gearing was close to reaching the 50 per cent target for the end of the
current year. It fell from 79 to 63 per cent during 1993-94 and was now 55
per cent after the Pounds 80m sale of the insulation business.
Profits from building glass continued to fall, from Pounds 56.6m to Pounds
50.8m at the operating level, as prices in continental Europe declined
again. In the UK, sales rose by a quarter and market share increased to 52
per cent - thanks to the purchase of Heywood Williams distribution business
at the start of the year. A 5 per cent price rise in February was holding.
Profits were substantially better in North America, and South America and
Australia were also good.
Automotive glass profits rose sharply, from Pounds 30.2m to Pounds 58.9m
driven by higher volumes in America.
Group sales rose 6.4 per cent to Pounds 2.74bn, with continuing operations
up 9.3 per cent to Pounds 2.52bn. Mr Andrew Robb, finance director, said
volume added 6 percentage points and the acquisition 5 points to sales, but
lower prices took 2 points off.
Operating profits from continuing businesses were up 19.2 per cent to Pounds
91.2m, with total profits at Pounds 104.2m (Pounds 88m). Investment income
rose from Pounds 13.8m to Pounds 22.5m. Associates contributed Pounds 21.3m
(Pounds 19.9m) and interest took Pounds 75.6m (Pounds 75.7m).
Mr Robb said the group was beginning to use tax losses in various
territories which had enabled the tax charge to fall from Pounds 46m to
Pounds 32.6m and the rate would continue to decline.

FT  10 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Dollars 143m China purchase for Cathay Intl
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cathay International Holdings, the China investment group, is to pay Dollars
143m (Pounds 95.3m) for 60 per cent of a company which will operate four
toll bridges and a tunnel in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou
(Canton).
In its first infrastructure investment in China, CIH has signed an agreement
for the project with the Guangzhou municipal government, which will
guarantee a minimum return of 15 per cent per annum. The franchise lasts for
20 years.
Mr Stephen Hunt, deputy chairman, said: 'Based on current projections, the
toll systems must be improved to achieve the required returns, but the
traffic volumes are already there.'
CIH plans to fund the investment through a debt placement, which will be
undertaken as soon as approval is given by shareholders and the Chinese
regulatory authorities.
The bridges and tunnel, which are the sole assets of the Zhujiang
Road-Bridges and Tunnels Company, are already operating and CIH should be
able to achieve profits as soon as the deal is signed, although it will have
to invest in improved toll systems.
Its partner is the city's municipal government. Mr Hunt said that under the
agreement CIH had the right to cover any shortfall in revenues from its
partner's 40 per cent share of cash flows. He was confident this would not
be necessary.
The return on assets is denominated in US dollars, so CIH should bear no
currency risk, and the company can increase tolls if revenue targets are not
met.
CIH was formed last year from the reverse takeover of Stonehill. It has
already invested in a hotel project in the city of Shenzhen, which borders
Hong Kong, and a hotel and property development in Beijing.
Under the agreement, CIH has the right to build and operate three further
bridges across the Pearl River in Guangzhou. CIH also considered an
investment in a number of municipal water plants in Guangzhou, but Mr Hunt
said the company had decided not to go ahead with the deal.

and over here. They are also under increasing scrutiny thanks to a new set
of guidelines circulated in May.
Directors are being encouraged to provide far greater disclosure of the
value of their share options than most companies now report, under draft
proposals issued this month by the urgent issues task force of the
Accounting Standards Board.
At a time when the debate on executive pay in both the US and the UK is
hotting up, Mr David Tweedie, ASB chairman, calls the guidelines a
'do-it-yourself kit' for investors wanting to place a value on options
granted.
Companies are being asked to show option information for all directors, and
separately listed for individual directors, which would highlight the number
of options granted, exercised, and lapsed unexercised. They should also
reveal the exercise price and the prevailing share price of any options
exercised during the financial year to which the accounts refer.
Unusually for proposed 'abstract' produced by the urgent issues task force,
the exposure draft on share options will not become mandatory, and cannot be
enforced by the Financial Reporting Review Panel.
The original aim, when board members began discussing the topic last year,
was to make its recommendations compulsory. However, they were caught by a
loophole in the law. The 1985 Companies Act calls for disclosure of
emoluments payable to directors, including 'the estimated money value of any
benefits . . . otherwise than in cash'. But the drafting of the law means
that if the benefits cannot be precisely quantified, they do not have to be
disclosed at all.
The Accounting Standards Board discovered - as has its equivalent in the US,
the Financial Accounting Standards Board - that there is considerable debate
and uncertainty about the valuation of options.
The board says that valuation would require theoretical, complex and
subjective models contingent on future performance, requiring continued
employment by directors. Lawyers say this level of uncertainty in developing
a single definitive value means that options need not be disclosed at all.
The board stresses that most of the details in its proposals must in any
case be revealed by law for quoted companies in a register of options
available for inspection. It adds that greater disclosure of executives'
remuneration is urged by the Cadbury committee on the financial aspects of
corporate governance in its report published at the end of 1992.
The principal additional recommendation from the task force is to bring all
this information together in the annual report, together with details of the
options' prices, which is not currently required.
For most companies, the proposals will require extra space and effort,
although some, including SmithKline Beecham, British Petroleum and Reuters
Holdings, already provide quite extensive disclosure of the value of share
options as part of the data on directors' remuneration.
Mr Phillip Wood, deputy finance director at Reuters, says: 'We're trying to
be a bit leading edge in our disclosure. We feel we have got nothing to
hide, and because the company is protected from takeover, there is an
additional burden on the board to demonstrate that we are well managed. This
is one area where there is no commercial sensitivity.'
Of course, what the task force's proposals do not raise is the desirability
of share options in the first place. Mr Alan McDougall, joint managing
director of Pensions Investment Research Consultants in the UK, which
advises many local authority pension funds, says: 'Options are almost like
money laundering. They are not exactly, but I can't think of a better name.'
He advises his clients to vote against options because he says there is
little evidence that they help improve company performance or motivate the
best managers, and because they are generally only granted to senior
executives rather than other employees who may be equally important in
improving profitabil-ity.
But at least investors of those companies that follow the guidelines will in
future have the chance of assessing the value to the business and to them of
the options granted to the board - and whether they should vote against
them.

FT  10 JUN 94 / UK Company News: British Land net assets surge 46% to 423p
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Land, the property company headed by Mr John Ritblat, yesterday
announced a 46 per cent rise in its net asset value to 423p a share in the
year ended March 31.
Gross assets increased by 38 per cent to Pounds 2.6bn.
At the pre-tax level, profits surged from Pounds 27.2m to Pounds 53.9m.
Mr Ritblat said British Land was 'exceptionally well placed'. 'We will
continue to target opportunities for acquisitions, whether direct or
corporate, with unabated effort,' he said.
He added, however, that he was reluctant to make an acquisition of a quoted
company because 'in our experience you only buy trouble'.
British Land has bought Pounds 1.6bn of property since 1989. In the past
year, the company has invested Pounds 615m in buying 200 properties.
Property sales during the year raised Pounds 50m. The British Land
partnership with Mr George Soros's Quantum Fund, has invested over Pounds
530m in the property market in the past year.
British Land's debt to equity ratio was reduced from 106 per cent to 61 per
cent. During the year, the company raised Pounds 665m in permanent capital
or long-term debt.
The current yield on the portfolio is 7.05 per cent. The uplift in the
underlying value of the property was 21 per cent, a rise of Pounds 385m. The
best performing property types were retail distribution centres, which rose
by 42.8 per cent. Superstores and supermarkets rose by 32.5 per cent in
value, shopping centres by 28.3 per cent and other retail properties by 30.3
per cent.
City of London offices rose by 12.9 per cent, while the average improvement
for UK offices was 13.9 per cent. The overseas portfolio, which is 7 per
cent of the total, rose by 1 per cent.
Earnings per share rose by 36 per cent to 11.7p (8.6p). A recommended final
dividend of 5.08p makes a 7.53p (7p) total.
COMMENT
British Land has emerged as perhaps the shrewdest of all the large quoted
companies to operate in the UK market in recent years. Shareholders have
been well rewarded by its heavy buying programme during the downturn, its
higher-than-average gearing and its adroit management of its debt. Moreover,
the company is likely to benefit from its shift in emphasis away from London
offices towards the retail sector that it has engineered over the past five
years. For all that, the property market has cooled since March and it will
be hard to pull off another bumper performance this year. Forecasts of this
year's net asset value range between 460p to 500p, while pre-tax profits are
likely to rise to Pounds 65m-70m. The shares, which rose yesterday by 5p to
389p, look good value assuming a discount to net assets of around 20 per
cent.

FT  10 JUN 94 / UK Company News: US operation lifts Dewhurst to Pounds 0.69m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Dewhurst, the electrical components and control equipment maker, reported
pre-tax profits 69 per cent ahead at Pounds 685,126 for the 26 weeks to
April 3, against Pounds 404,487.
Turnover was up 4 per cent at Pounds 5.39m (Pounds 5.17m). Earnings per
share were 3.99p (2.36p) and the interim dividend is raised from 0.66p to
0.75p.
Steady growth in demand for keypad products and a strong performance from
lift components in the US offset the expected downturn in rail equipment
sales.

FT  10 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Northumbrian Water hit by Pounds 8.4m Amtec
charge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unhappy diversification dragged down profits at Northumbrian Water which
yesterday announced a 9.5 per cent decline at the pre-tax level to Pounds
62.8m, on sales 18 per cent ahead to Pounds 298.6m.
The rate of dividend increase has been maintained in spite of the profits
decline. The proposed final is 16.2p against 15p, bringing the total to
24.3p - 8 per cent higher than last year. Earnings fell by 17 per cent to
83.5p.
Profits were hit by an Pounds 8.4m charge for withdrawing from the
loss-making pipe maintenance company, Amtec, which had been announced at the
interim stage. Northumbrian said uncertainty surrounding the current price
review had held back orders for Amtec.
'People are just not committing expenditure on that activity until they know
the results of the review,' the company said. Amtec was one of
Northumbrian's earliest diversifications after privatisation, purchased for
about Pounds 5.8m.
The core water and sewage division returned operating profits 21 per cent up
at Pounds 80.8m, on sales 7 per cent higher at Pounds 225.7m. Unlike its
fellow water companies, Northumbrian saw an 11 per cent increase in raw
water delivered for industrial use.
The non-regulated businesses, which include an environmental consultancy
operation and waste management, incurred operating losses of Pounds 3.3m,
against a profit of Pounds 2.9m.
Northumbrian said the integration of the environmental consultants purchased
from Simon Engineering last year was proceeding according to plan. The
company has admitted mistakes in the past over the integration of Amtec. It
said no further acquisitions in this business were planned until Entec was
fully in hand.
Northumbrian sought to stress its financial strength, with cash flow rising
from Pounds 36.1m to Pounds 146.7m. This reflected the release of funds
invested in leasing, the group said. Total investment in leasing fell from
Pounds 96.7m to Pounds 50.4m.
Net debt as a proportion of shareholders' funds fell from 14 per cent to 8
per cent.
COMMENT
There are two things to consider about Northumbrian: its track record on
diversification and its financial strength. On the first issue, the Amtec
experience has been a disaster. The group's strategy also seems uncertain,
being based on a variety of businesses, none of which seems to stand out bar
waste management. On the other hand, Northumbrian has managed to retain one
of the highest dividend covers in the sector, in spite of the Amtec upset,
and it is only just geared. Most expect Northumbrian to receive a higher
than average increase in the current price review, due to its heavy capital
commitments. Forecasts are for Pounds 77.5m, with a further 8 per cent
divvie rise to 26.4p. The shares are likely to remain jittery until after
the review.

FT  10 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Judge to rule over Scrabble squabble
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A High Court judge will next Tuesday be asked to decide on the squabble over
Scrabble, the board game which is the main target for two US toy groups
battling for control of JW Spear.
Hasbro, the biggest US toy company and maker of Action Man, is proceeding
against trustees controlling 24.9 per cent of the family-run group. It will
argue that the trustees are still bound by agreements to sell the stake, in
spite of an eleventh hour bid by Mattel, Hasbro's US rival.
Mattel, maker of Barbie dolls, yesterday noted news of the court case 'with
regret.' The group said its offer of Pounds 10 a share - Pounds 1 above the
Hasbro offer - was made at Spear's invitation.
Hasbro, which launched its Pounds 46.9m unsolicited bid on May 27, has been
the biggest shareholder outside the Spear family for the past four years,
with 26.7 per cent. The trustees had given irrevocable undertakings to
accept unless a better offer was made within three business days.
Mattel's offer, valuing Spear at Pounds 52m, was made at just five minutes
to midnight on the final day.
The announcement was lodged with the Stock Exchange, while the Takeover
Panel and both sets of advisers were informed of the offer.
Hasbro claims that this was not a public announcement, and so the
undertakings remain valid.
Mattel has been advised that the announcement of its bid was 'sufficient to
release the trustees from their undertakings to Hasbro.' It understood that
the trustees had received identical advice.
If Hasbro wins on Tuesday, it will be able to declare its offer
unconditional. If it loses it could, under the terms of its original bid,
increase its offer.
The Spear board - apart from Mr Francis Spear, chairman - yesterday
reiterated its description of the Hasbro offer as 'wholly inadequate.'

FT  10 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Chrysalis tumbles to Pounds 32,000 and
makes investment plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Chris Wright, chairman of Chrysalis, the media and music group, warned
shareholders yesterday of 'a sustained period of investment', which will
have inevitable consequences for both financial performance and dividends.
The Chrysalis chairman made his strategy clear yesterday as the company
announced a pre-tax profit of Pounds 32,000 on a turnover of Pounds 32.3m
for the six months to the end of February. The modest profit compares with
Pounds 104,000 for the same period last year, but a pre-tax loss of Pounds
14.6m for the year to the end of August 1993.
The interim profit reflected a Pounds 1.4m credit from the release of
provisions arising from closing down of MAM Leisure, the company's amusement
machine manufacturer.
Last year only a final dividend was paid with scrip alternative and
Chrysalis said yesterday there would be no interim dividend. No decision has
been taken on a final.
Chrysalis has been building up its visual entertainment division by buying
stakes in independent producers and setting up development deals for British
film producers and directors. It has also been adding to its roster of
songwriters for its music publishing activities.
Mr Wright added that the company did not intend to change its accounting
policies to capitalise the expenditure and financial performance,
particularly for the current year, 'is likely to be compromised.'
He pointed out however, that Chrysalis had made considerable progress
towards achieving its long term goals and objectives - to become a broadly
based media and music group.
Earnings per share were 1.35p (0.2p), but following Pony Canyon's minority
investment in the group's new Echo record label, net assets have increased
to Pounds 53m, compared with Pounds 44m at the end of August.
The share price closed up 4p at 175p.

FT  10 JUN 94 / Nikkei reaches two-year high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Economic optimism continued to sweep the Tokyo stock market yesterday, with
the third day of rising prices pushing it to the highest point since March
1992.
The rise in the Nikkei average, by 140.84 points to 21,402.78, reinforces
its break through the technical barrier of 21,000 earlier this week and
leaves it nearly 23 per cent ahead of the level at the turn of the year.
Early this morning, the average was ahead a further 48.01 points, at
21,450.79.
'If there are still any doubters at this late stage, this should show that
the book is closed on the recession and that sentiment should be on the
upswing for the next year or two,' said Mr Alan Livsey, equity strategist at
Kleinwort Benson in Tokyo.
Analysts said the rise reflected the decision by formerly cautious Japanese
institutional investors to increase share purchases, as shown by a sharp
rise in volumes. Yesterday, 850m shares changed hands, more than twice last
year's daily average.
Japanese institutions, absent in the early stages of the market's rise this
year, have been encouraged by a recent string of good economic indicators,
likely to be extended today when the Bank of Japan publishes its latest
Tankan quarterly report on the short-term economic outlook.
Mr Jesper Koll, chief economist at SG Warburg Securities in Tokyo, marks the
institutions' change of sentiment from last week's publication of Ministry
of International Trade and Industry survey, showing that companies planned
to increase capital investment by 1.1 per cent in 1994, the first rise for
three years. 'Domestic institutions' confidence in the 1994 economy and the
prospects for profits recovery has increased,' he said.
However, analysts are divided over whether corporate Japan will show an
earnings recovery this year. Japanese analysts tend to be less cheerful than
foreign-owned ones. Sanyo Investment Research forecasts a 2.3 per cent
profits decline, while Kleinwort Benson has a 20 per cent recovery. For this
reason, share prices might fall back again in the next few months, warned
analysts.

FT  10 JUN 94 / Lonrho aims for African mining deal: Opportunities beckon in
South Africa - Pounds 41m first-half profits disappoint
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lonrho is planning to double the size of its African mining interests in a
deal expected to be announced within the next year.
Mr Dieter Bock, joint chief executive of the conglomerate, said Lonrho had
received several 'offers from institutions to supply funds without raising
borrowing levels - for instance a rights issue'. Mr Bock added that Lonrho,
which raised Pounds 170m through a rights issue just 18 months ago, had no
immediate plans for a cash call.
Analysts were surprised at the statement, as they had not been told of the
plans at their meeting. Prospects of an equity issue were greeted with
trepidation, given Lonrho's thin dividend cover.
The proposed deal may centre on Lonrho's platinum operations in South
Africa, where political change is felt to have created new opportunities for
the group. These mines have been the focus of speculation about a possible
deal with Gencor. Combining the two companies' interests, said one analyst,
would create 'the world's biggest force in platinum'.
Lonrho would only say it did not intend to cut its 76 per cent stake in
platinum.
Mr Tiny Rowland, joint chief executive, and Mr Bock, who fought a protracted
battle for management control of Lonrho earlier this year, sought to present
a united front at yesterday's interim results meeting. Nevertheless, there
seemed to be continuing differences, in spite of Mr Bock's boardroom
shake-up in January. These became most apparent over the possible flotation
of a stake in Lonrho's African trading interests. Mr Rowland said Lonrho was
likely to include its sugar business. Analysts said this had been ruled out
earlier in the day by Mr Bock. 'This could be the prelude to another
battle,' said one.
The group reported a 45 per cent drop in profits to Pounds 41m for the six
months to March 31, on sales down 37 per cent at Pounds 951m. The previous
year was inflated by a Pounds 53m gain on disposals.
The results were seen as disappointing, particularly in the light of a
Pounds 7m exceptional gain on the sale of a Belgian property. While the core
operations had all returned improved profits, there were 'still a lot of
bits and pieces causing red ink,' said one analyst. The shares closed 5p
down at 134 1/2 p.
Lonrho finished the first half with a net cash outflow of Pounds 25m,
against an inflow of Pounds 76m last time. Mr Colin Matthews, Lonrho's chief
accountant, said the group expected to have a net cash inflow in 1995.
Gearing was expected to rise 'slightly' by the end of this year from the
half-way 25 per cent, which included an increase in net assets related to
the Ashanti Goldfields flotation - Lonrho's stake is valued at Pounds 485m.
The dividend was maintained at 2p. Earnings fell from 6.4p to 2.2p, although
they rose from a loss of 0.8p in continuing operations.

FT  10 JUN 94 / C&amp;G bars new deposits as it mulls over ruling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor, and ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society yesterday closed its doors to
new customer deposits in the wake of the High Court ruling barring the terms
of Lloyds Bank's Pounds 1.8bn cash bid.
In what it said was a short-term measure to prevent people in ignorance
attempting to make a speculative gain from the Lloyds offer, it barred any
new customers depositing money in any of its four investment accounts. It
said last night it would not allow new deposits for a few days while it
examined the court's decision and to prevent people 'chasing a fast buck on
the wrong basis'.
The court ruling would not in fact allow new depositors to take advantage of
the Lloyds offer, but the building society believed that some might
interpret the judgment in this way.
The action came as Lloyds and C&amp;G executives and advisers met to consider
ways of restructuring the offer to bring it within the ruling by Sir Donald
Nicholls, the vice-chancellor. They may also appeal.
Sir Donald ruled on Tuesday that Lloyds could not make cash payments to more
than 220,000 C&amp;G investors who had been shareholding members of the society
for less than two years. This would make it hard to achieve the necessary
majority in favour of the deal.
Lloyds and C&amp;G could instead offer preference shares to all 1.2m C&amp;G
shareholders and borrowers, or offer such shares to new members. They are
unlikely to be allowed to offer shares that could be immediately sold.
Lloyds said yesterday that the two groups were unlikely to make an early
decision, and could delay a statement until next week. Lloyds' share price
closed 5p down at 566p.
Mr Donald Kirkham, Building Societies Association chairman, said the
association welcomed the principle that 'you cannot join a society one
moment and then share in the whole value of it the next'.

FT  10 JUN 94 / Building societies shake off the fear of 'blackmail': John
Gapper hears a sigh of relief in the sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the first time since Lloyds bid for Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester on April 21,
a feeling of order has been restored to the building society industry.
Although several chief executives of building societies thought that C&amp;G's
team of advisers and lawyers might find a way around the obstacle erected by
the High Court, which ruled that the structure of Pounds 1.8bn cash bid was
illegal, most were convinced that a restructured deal would relieve pressure
to follow suit.
The 1.2m members of C&amp;G who would have been eligible for payments of at
least Pounds 500, and up to Pounds 10,000 each, may not be so pleased at the
safeguards to mutuality being preserved. But chief executives of societies
were breathing a little more easily.
If Sir Donald Nicholls, the vice-chancellor, had decided in favour of the
bid, it would have placed strong pressure on the Treasury to respond by
tightening the law. But the decision also appears to leave the way clear for
the government to proceed with its review of the 1986 Building Societies Act
peacefully.
Mr David O'Brien, chief executive of National &amp; Provincial, summed up the
mood of many executives of larger societies. 'It leaves us exactly where we
were before, but it gives us a little more confidence that we do not have to
fight in a legal environment with an obvious flaw.'
Sir Donald's bar on cash payments to members of societies who have held
shareholding accounts for less than two years is a large obstacle to banks
taking over societies. It precludes cash from Lloyds' Pounds 1.8bn bid being
paid to 27 per cent of C&amp;G's 825,000 shareholding investors.
This makes it particularly hard for fast-growing societies to cross the
voting thresholds for transferring to an existing company. These require the
society to achieve not only a 50 per cent majority among those eligible to
vote, but a 75 per cent majority of those who actually do vote.
Even if the 220,000 investors debarred for payment did not vote, C&amp;G could
probably achieve this, but a move among them to scupper the deal could
easily succeed. Thus societies with similar proportions of new members -
such as Britannia and Woolwich - will also find takeovers difficult.
This appears to lessen considerably the worst fear raised by the Lloyds/C&amp;G
deal: that it would expose other societies to a form of blackmail. Although
boards of societies have no legal obligation to put offers to members, they
could be vulnerable to a public debate on an offer.
Society executives were worried that if Lloyds was able to distribute such
large sums of cash to C&amp;G members, their own members' would have their hopes
raised. This would mean that banks could threaten to publish a cash offer
for a society unless its board agreed to recommend it.
Mr Chris Sharp, managing director of Northern Rock, said 'there may not be
the same pressure' hanging over societies as a result of the ruling. It
would be harder for banks to 'excite the membership to demand an general
meeting to consider the overtures they have made to the society'.
Yet this conclusion may not be clear-cut if C&amp;G members of under two years'
standing can be given value in some way. The only apparently foolproof way
of doing this is to wait for a change in their status by delaying the deal,
but this would require the society to put off new members.
A simpler step would be to pay members of under two years' standing in
shares, either ordinary or preference. Mr John Wriglesworth, building
societies analyst at UBS, says this is possible because Abbey National's
share distribution for its 1989 flotation was ruled legal by courts.
But there are three difficulties with switching from cash to shares:
One benefit of the deal to Lloyds was that it absorbed excess capital. A
rights issue to finance the deal would not allow this, and would also dilute
existing holders. Preference shares would be better, but Lloyds might want
to issue them through a subsidiary rather than the holding company.
Any handout of redeemable shares easily convertible into cash would almost
certainly be challenged by the Building Societies Commission. The best that
holders could expect would be a coupon on the shares and the ability to
trade them publicly after the initial distribution.
If preference shares were issued, the Abbey National ruling suggests that no
'priority' could be given to new holders. Mr Wriglesworth says this would
force C&amp;G to make a flat rate offer to all eligible members and depositors -
rather than varying the amounts and paying large depositors more.
Any restructured deal is unlikely to be as easy for C&amp;G members to
understand. This will in turn make it easier for other building societies to
convince their members of the benefits of mutuality. They argue that not
having to pay dividends allows societies to compete with banks.
Several building societies also believed it would be immoral for new members
simply to pilfer net assets built up over time. 'It is akin to joining a
tennis club and voting to sell the ground underneath to a developer,' said
Mr Donald Kirkham, chief executive of the Woolwich.
It may be easier for smaller regional-based societies to carry that case
with conviction than large societies with millions of members which have
little obvious connection with their roots. But most societies felt
yesterday that Sir Donald had at least given them a fighting chance.

FT  10 JUN 94 / Electricity generator may swap assets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PowerGen, the electricity generator, yesterday indicated a preference for an
assets swap with an overseas company as it revealed a 20.5 per cent rise in
dividend payments on the back of last year's Pounds 476m pre-tax profits.
Mr Ed Wallis, chief executive, said a cross-border deal was the company's
favoured option to fulfil an agreement with the electricity regulator to try
to dispose of 2,000MW of generating plant.
The company had been approached by about 20 parties interested in buying the
plant but considered only a handful to be serious, Mr Wallis said. However,
any disposal could take time to achieve.
In the year to April 3, PowerGen's pre-tax profits of Pounds 476m
represented a 12 per cent rise on 1992-93's Pounds 425m. This was in spite
of a Pounds 24m net increase in provisions and an 8 per cent reduction in
sales to Pounds 2.94bn.
A lower tax charge enabled the company to lift earnings per share by 20.5
per cent to 44p (36.5p) and the dividend for the year to 12.65p (10.5p)
after a final of 8.7p. Analysts said similar dividend rises were possible
next year. Cover remained at 3.5 times earnings against a policy of reducing
it to 2.5 to 2.7.
Mr Wallis said market share, down 1 percentage point to 26 per cent, was
likely to fall further and could reach 22 per cent in 1995-96. He expected
it to rise again as new capacity came on stream. Job numbers fell 11 per
cent to 4,399 and salaries and overhead costs were down from Pounds 566m to
Pounds 439m.
Last year's performance was also helped by a reduction in coal stocks, from
15.7m tonnes to 12.9m. Mr John Rennocks, finance director, said he expected
a further cut to less than 5m in the next two years.
Gearing rose to 15 per cent at the year-end. During the year PowerGen paid
the full Pounds 441m costs of developing its Connah's Quay gas station,
reducing the total cost by Pounds 54m.
Mr Wallis said three of the company's four new business areas - offshore
gas, gas trading, and combined heat and power - were UK-based. In the
fourth, overseas, the company did not need to take the corporate
acquisitions route. It preferred a lower-risk strategy, for example,
building power plant in other countries.

FT  10 JUN 94 / BBC threat to suspend strikers: Corporation may use
freelance labour to beat disruption
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY and ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The BBC has decided to take disciplinary action against staff if strikes
continue next week. The Corporation said it may use freelance labour to
overcome future disruption.
The decision was taken on Wednesday evening by the full board of management
on the eve of yesterday's second 24-hour strike. Coverage of polling in the
European elections and in five UK by-elections was disrupted.
The dispute is over performance-related pay proposals and an element of
decentralised bargaining on conditions at the BBC.
The unions will announce today how they plan to affect Sunday's broadcasts -
not necessarily by another 24-hour strike.
If Sunday's dispute goes ahead, all BBC staff will receive a letter warning
them that the management will start suspending staff if further action is
taken. Such action is planned for next Tuesday and Friday.
An intensification of the dispute would almost certainly be accompanied by
hiring freelances.
Senior managers will address staff meetings throughout the UK today to
promote the improved proposals presented to the unions at the end of last
week after four days of talks at Acas, the conciliation service. They will
emphasise that the present offer is the final one.
Mr Tony Lennon, president of Bectu, the main broadcasting union, said last
night: 'The stakes are very high in the dispute. If any staff are threatened
with suspension we will have to take serious stock of the situation.' The
unions would go only as far as the members wanted and members would be
consulted if management began disciplinary action.
He said: 'If the BBC tried to impose a deal on the staff, it would destroy
the last vestige of trust the staff have in the top brass.' Local managers
would also face 'fermenting resentment' and 'outright anarchy' in some
areas.
The unions would like to return to Acas for further negotiations but the BBC
made clear yesterday that it would not return to the conciliation body
except for matters of clarification.
The One O'Clock News, Six O'Clock News and Nine O'Clock News were broadcast
yesterday in spite of the strike.
The BBC's By-Election Special Programme was also broadcast as planned,
presented by Peter Snow and David Dimbleby.
Unions said support for yesterday strike was at the same overall level as
the first 24-hour strike in May, when the vast majority of staff did not
work.
A 3 per cent pay rise is already on offer. The BBC concessions at Acas
included strengthing a code of practice on work scheduling and making
safeguards for protected days off and 'unpredictability allowances' - part
of the core BBC-wide conditions of service.
The unions want provision for penalty payments for non-stop work of more
than 12 hours and breaks of less than 10 hours and clearer definitions of
what constitutes an off-duty day.

FT  10 JUN 94 / Kenyan central bank used false account to hide fraud
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES HARDING and MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A UK subsidiary of Banque Indosuez, the Paris-based merchant bank, last year
created an account for a fictitious Dollars 100m (Pounds 66.6m) deposit for
the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) which was used by the CBK to conceal a
foreign exchange fraud from international creditors.
The account was due to close six months later after the completion of an
investigation into mismanagement at the central bank and a meeting of
Kenya's aid donors chaired by the World Bank in November. However, Banque
Indosuez insists that it was unaware of the CBK attempt to conceal the
fraud.
CBK closed the account once its existence had been uncovered by the
International Monetary Fund, which had been examining Kenya's servicing of
its foreign debt. A second account for a fictitious Dollars 110m, which also
artificially inflated Kenya's foreign exchange reserves, was uncovered at a
UK subsidiary of another international bank, and also closed.
In June last year, Banque Indosuez Sogem Aval agreed to make a 'book entry'
to the account of CBK for a 'notional deposit' of Dollars 100m although 'no
transfer of funds was involved', according to a copy of the confidential
contract obtained by the Financial Times.
Mr Francois Vikar, communications director at Banque Indosuez in Paris,
acknowledged that the CBK approached Indosuez Aval 'wanting to do window
dressing before the visit of IMF officials'. He explained that in order 'to
make things look absolutely normal', Indosuez Aval made interest payments on
the fictitious deposits using moneys made available from a central bank
advance. However, Mr Vikar says the CBK did not identify a fraud was being
concealed.
The creation of fictitious foreign exchange deposits was part of an exercise
by CBK intended to mask funds missing after Exchange Bank, a Kenyan
commercial bank, defaulted on a foreign exchange forward contract worth
KSh9.9bn.
Exchange Bank was closed by reformist finance minister Musalia Mudavadi in
July last year. Exchange Bank's owner, Mr Kamlesh Pattni, a Kenyan
entrepreneur, was arrested last week on 22 separate charges of stealing from
the central bank.
Four former senior CBK officials, of whom two were signatories to the
Indosuez Aval contract, have also been arrested for alleged theft from the
central bank.
The new central bank governor, Mr Micah Cheserem, acknowledged a series of
frauds earlier this year. and is trying to recover the funds that were lost
in the Dollars 210m foreign exchange fraud.

FT  10 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Sterling
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Judging by its strength in recent weeks, sterling has been unmoved by
Euro-election nerves. After a low around DM2.48 three weeks ago, sterling
yesterday rose above DM2.52, its highest level since early April. In the
same period, the trade weighted-index has risen nearly a full point to 80.6.
But this does not mean the currency markets have been ignoring politics;
rather that stronger forces have been pushing sterling higher.
Part of this is the currency's usual tendency to move up in the backwash of
a higher dollar. More important is the growing awareness of the currency
markets of the strength of the economic recovery - fuelled in particular
this week by strong industrial production figures  - and the expectation
that this will lead the authorities to start raising interest rates sooner
rather than later. Indeed, since the short sterling futures contract is
pricing in a half-point rise in base rates by September, one might have
expected sterling's recovery to have been even more pronounced. That it has
only risen as far as DM2.52 suggests a poor election showing for the Tories
was priced into the exchange rate already.
In that sense, the market has little to fear from the result. But for
sterling to rise much further depends first on the recovery remaining robust
and second on the Bank of England's success in using its increased influence
to ensure that its hard line on inflation prevails.

FT  10 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Pilkington
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Pilkington's management can reasonably claim that a turning point has been
reached in the group's rehabilitation. Factor in the disposal of the
insulation business which came after the year-end and gearing has been
reduced to 55 per cent. Due to a squeeze on working capital and operating
costs, as well as a one-off tax rebate last year, there has also been a
substantial improvement in operating cash flow. Pilkington could thus afford
both the purchase of Heywood Williams and its stake in Societa Italiana
Vetro while still reducing its borrowing. Now it must turn its attention to
increasing margins.
The equity market seems to have assumed that the rebound will be both easy
and automatic as economic recovery gathers force. At 176p, the shares are
trading on a historic multiple of nearly 90 times pre-exceptional earnings.
That would be all right if a quick and dramatic rebound were in sight. The
reality, however, is likely to be more prosaic. Even in the US, where
capacity use is now around 95 per cent, Pilkington's operating margin was
less than 4 per cent in 1993-94.
It may still take years for the group margin to reach double digits,
especially if this does turn out to be a recovery in which consumers resist
price increases. In that case, earnings growth will disappoint the market -
as will dividend growth, given the need to rebuild cover. Mr Roger Leverton,
chief executive, has done a good job restructuring Pilkington, but that does
not mean he can work miracles too.

FT  10 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Lonrho
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The flotation of Ashanti Goldfields has won Lonrho new friends. US investors
have increased their holding to around 20 per cent in recent months,
apparently on the view that a net asset value of 187p per share  - when
adjusted for the market value of its Ashanti stake - makes Lonrho shares at
134p look cheap. While there is some merit in this line of argument, the
logic demands that Lonrho manages its assets more effectively than in the
past. Yesterday's interim figures did not inspire confidence in this regard.
The main disappointment came in manufacturing, which swung into loss due to
problems in areas ranging from UK construction to textiles in Malawi. While
progress in hotels and distribution is more encouraging, Lonrho's 2 per cent
return on sales outside Africa is hardly adequate. The group's weak cash
flow also limits its room for manoeuvre. Gearing of around 30 per cent is no
longer a worry, but interest payments of Pounds 28m in the first half
continue to soak up free cash flow. That may explain Lonrho's desire to
float its African trading activities, which would open another avenue for
raising funds as well as pleasing shareholders interested in net asset
values.
Yet the more conventional solution to the weak cash position - and the one
most investors might prefer to see - would be to squeeze more profit out of
the non-African interests. It can only be hoped that Lonrho finds a chairman
capable of balancing the deal-making instincts of Messrs Rowland and Bock
with the emphasis on line management of BTR or Hanson.

FT  10 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Cash power
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PowerGen will have its work cut out to invest all the cash generated by its
core UK generation business. In the last financial year, it only avoided a
cash mountain by paying GEC Pounds 483m upfront for the construction of a
new gas station. Even then, gearing only rose to 15 per cent.
Net cash inflow from the core business, after tax and dividends, will
average around Pounds 200m a year between now and the end of the century.
PowerGen's plans for deploying this cash contrast with National Power's.
While its larger rival has set its sights on investing Pounds 1bn overseas,
PowerGen's international ambitions are more modest. True, it will build
stations abroad if the returns are right. But its main thrust is to expand
in the UK through buying offshore gas and supplying gas via its Kinetica
joint venture.
The strategy has merit provided it is not carried too far. PowerGen's
expertise in supplying large electricity consumers is relevant to Kinetica's
business of supplying large gas consumers. It also makes sense for PowerGen
to own sufficient gas both for its own needs and to supply Kinetica. But it
is hard to see the company adding value if it extended these activities more
broadly. There would be little point in entering the domestic gas market
since it has no competence in supplying small consumers. Equally, PowerGen
has no expertise relevant to managing gas fields. To be fair, the company so
far shows no signs of splashing out in either way. But that brings it back
to the problem of how to spend its cash flow. Unless it can find other
profitable investments, the cash would be better handed back to investors.

FT  10 JUN 94 / Hopes smothered in shifting sands: Jordan's King Hussein
outlines to FT writers his frustration and fears for the Middle East
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS, MARK NICHOLSON and JAMES WHITTINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Life is Hell. How much stress is too much stress?' reads the headline over a
cartoon in a modest office used by King Hussein of Jordan. It could well
provide a motto for a man who has survived more than 40 years at the centre
of a still turbulent Middle East.
To what extent that cartoon reflects the king's mood may be a matter of
debate, but there is no doubting the depth of his frustration, even
exasperation, revealed by the occasional flash of bitterness about political
developments in the region. A conversation with the king offers no trace of
euphoria about the Middle East peace process, in spite of his assessment
that it is 'irreversible', but rather a deep disappointment at the
opportunities missed, and some foreboding about the future.
Beneath the diplomatic veneer, it also reveals the frustration of a man who,
for the past four decades, has been at the centre of attempts to bring about
a lasting regional peace, but who may be sensing that he and Jordan have
been edged to the periphery of a process which could define his country's
future.
Much of King Hussein's dismay stems from the failure of Arab nations to rise
above narrow self-interest, and his reluctant acceptance that Jordan may
eventually have no option but to abandon one of its most fundamental
commitments: its refusal to sign a separate peace deal with Israel. Before
Jordan, Syria, Lebanon and the Palestinians sat down with Israel at the
Madrid peace conference in October 1991, they had agreed that their greatest
strength lay in unity. They were determined to avoid the example of Egypt,
which in 1979 signed a separate peace with Israel, and not allow themselves
to be picked off individually by Israel.
'Sadly, that co-ordination has been a myth,' said the king, 'particularly in
regard to our Palestinian brethren. I had hoped that there would be the kind
of co-ordination that would allow us to address jointly our problems with
Israel. This has not happened. As a result we are convinced we cannot wait
any longer. We have to address the problems which relate to the interests of
this country. But at the same time we remain ready to address any request
for help (from the Palestinians) to the best of our ability.'
However, the king does not know what the Palestinians want from Jordan, any
more than he knew that Mr Yassir Arafat, the chairman of the Palestine
Liberation Organisation, was last summer secretly negotiating an outline
peace agreement with Israel which culminated on September 13 in a signing
ceremony at the White House. The Palestinian leadership then proceeded to
provoke the Jordanians further by signing an economic agreement with Israel
which in some areas contradicted (for instance, on banking and financial
controls in the West Bank) a deal already struck with the government in
Amman. 'Instead of Jordan having an economic agreement with the
Palestinians, and the Palestinians having an agreement with Israel, we are
now having to discuss the whole thing all over again. We could have saved
time if we had co-ordinated in the first place,' said King Hussein.
The relationship does not appear to have improved since the PLO took control
of 60 per cent of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho following
the withdrawal of Israeli troops last month. The king stresses his
commitment to help the Palestinians, but added, sighing: 'If there are
specifics asked of us, we would like to know in advance what they are.' For
example, if they want help with electricity distribution, 'we are already
suffering a shortage, so if they ask this of us we may not be able to
deliver'. But the king left the impression that he doubted whether the PLO
leadership knew what it wanted - or indeed whether it adequately represented
the aspirations of the Gazan and Jericho Palestinians it now leads.
One consequence of the PLO attitude has been Jordan's decision to resume
direct negotiations with Israel this week in Washington, for the first time
since September. These should build on an outline peace 'agenda' agreed at
that time which set out territorial, security and economic issues to be
discussed. 'We have always sought to achieve progress since the ratification
of the agenda between Jordan and Israel. I am very pleased by the fact that
we seem to be at the beginning of the serious work which is required by both
sides.'
The key question is how far down that road King Hussein will venture, and
whether he might be willing to sign a peace treaty with Israel before Syria
and Lebanon. Alternatively, having already seen Egypt and the PLO abandon a
joint Arab approach, King Hussein may privately fear that Syria could go the
same way. He senses that substantial progress in the Israeli-Syrian
negotiations may not be long delayed, with Mr Warren Christopher, the US
secretary of state, likely to resume his shuttle diplomacy soon. 'We have
our own unique problems,' said the king. 'Syria has its own unique problems.
I would not say that we know exactly what is going on there. Nor are we
required to provide details of what is going on here.'
It is an answer which leaves all Jordanian options open. It also underscores
King Hussein's fears that while Arab governments may be on the brink of
securing an historic regional peace, they are failing to develop either
regional co-ordination or the political systems which would put the fruits
of peace in the hands of their people. 'It is a very sad phase. It is also
very dangerous in some respects. It is one which causes despair. And the
reaction to it, the extremism as you see it, is a reflection of poor
economic conditions and feelings of utter frustration. I will not be very
popular for saying it, but it is the result of a lack of ability to bring
about institutions which give people a meaning to their lives, give people
the right to decide what the future should be. In other words, democracy,
freedom and respect for human rights. If this continues to be absent, and
continues to be denied, then we have problems.'
The king is proud of his own response to such fissile political sentiments:
an evolving democracy which last year saw the country's first multi-party
election, and one in which an Islamic party won seats. 'All schools of
political thought have found a common language and a common ground for this
country to thrive and to continue to develop with democracy and with respect
to the constitution. We hope that others might look at us as something that
works, not as something that is a challenge to them.'
King Hussein watches with particular distaste the war in Yemen which his
personal diplomacy had failed to avert. Here, in the king's eyes, was a
union blessed by the Yemenis and bound by a democratic election, which is
being fragmented not, he says, from within but by outside meddling. 'There
are elements that are interested in fragmenting this country (Yemen), and
this is criminal,' he says, in what appeared to be an allusion to Saudi
Arabia and other Gulf states. King Hussein says he has now 'withdrawn from
the scene'.
His withdrawal is symptomatic of a deeper feeling that the king's experience
and advice is being ignored among Arab and western states. Partly, as he
acknowledges, this relative isolation derives from Jordan's inability to
claw back the diplomatic ground it lost as a result of the king's opposition
to the war against Iraq. Relations with Egypt remain cool, and the king was
again snubbed by King Fahd during a recent trip to Saudi Arabia.
The favour of western allies is returning, but slowly. This weekend King
Hussein will fly to Washington to meet President Bill Clinton with whom he
says a 'very good friendship' is developing.
But whatever diplomatic comfort the trip will provide, his journey to the US
might offer a more important cause for personal celebration and one that
will bring relief in Jordan. At the start of a 10-day trip, King Hussein
will learn whether he remains clear of the cancer that caused the removal of
a kidney two years ago. 'If everything's all right with me I will not have
to repeat what I have done over the last two years with six-monthly tests.
After this test the need probably will be for an annual check-up.'
King Hussein's vigour reinforces that optimism. But it is an ill omen for
the Arab world that its most senior statesman and leader can summon so
little optimism about the health of its body politic.

Invisible exports will never be quite the same again - Britain has managed
to sell its controversial new system of vocational qualifications to Oman.
It's the first time the system - which rewards an individual's ability to do
a job rather than assessing his or her knowledge about a task - has been
sold lock, stock and barrel.
The UK's NVQs have been unfavourably compared with their Continental
counterparts. But John Hiller, who helped devise the system, says that 'the
Omanis are as realistic as the rest of us . . . they recognise that no
system is perfect, and that there is hardly a country in the world with as
coherent a system. The fact that it isn't perfect is less important than its
coherence.'

Karolos Papoulios, Greece's foreign minister, could be forgiven for thinking
the Turks are deliberately making life uncomfortable for him. Arriving at
Istanbul for yesterday's Nato meeting, he told his Turkish hosts he wished
to pay his respects to the Orthodox Patriarch.
But the police escort apparently mistook Fener, the official seat of the
head of the Eastern Church, for Fenerbahce. Only the hasty intervention of
an alert official prevented Papoulios finding himself dropped off in a
run-down district best known for its football club.

turned senior Fiat executive, is rotund, ebullient, chatty. But they share
certain features - apart from their initials. Both were career diplomats
before becoming ministers. And it seems they share a common ancestral abode.
Ricupero's grandparents were Italian immigrants from Naples, where Ruggiero

Inter-Rail's full page advert in several of Britain's quality dailies
yesterday gave a fresh meaning to the term European Union. It showed 12

blue background.
The copywriting featured a plethora of double entendres - 'the Inter-Rail
pass gives you the freedom to go as far as you want in Europe' - spuriously
tagged to this being the EU's year of Europe Against Aids.
The slogan left something to be desired: 'Inter-Rail. You've got the rest of
your life to be good.' Just like the copywriters, when you think about it.

<TEXT>
More dirty suds spill over from the Unilever-Procter &amp; Gamble soap war.
Germany's Henkel group is foaming at the mouth, fearful it may get washed up
in the overflow.
The detergent and chemicals group has shot out a panic press release from
its Dusseldorf HQ, informing the world that 'German Persil has nothing to do
with English Persil Power'.
Henkel has been swamped with queries about whether its Persil contains the
magic Unilever formula - which P&amp;G says rots fibres. But Henkel launched its
Persil in Germany back in 1907; the brand remains Germany's undisputed
market leader.
Unilever has controlled the rights to market Persil in Britain and France
'for decades', says Henkel. Everywhere else in Europe, the product is a
German one. Henkel's statement scrupulously avoided taking sides in the
slanging match between the two Anglo-Saxon soap giants; just trying to show
that its hands are clean, presumably.

FT  10 JUN 94 / Personal View: The wrong way to compete
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT BISCHOF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This week's report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development on unemployment in Europe seems to come out strongly in favour
of the UK government's economic policy, in particular with regard to its
Maastricht opt-out of the social chapter. The basic message from both runs
like this: Europe's labour and social costs have become too expensive and
its labour laws are too inflexible. In particular, they give employees too
many rights and too much job protection.
The UK government would add: lucky and successful Britain has no such
problems and where they arise they are attacked vigorously. Hence the UK is
first out of recession and has reduced unemployment.
Consider also the following, however: Germany and Switzerland have some 80
per cent higher labour costs per hour than Britain and Spain, about 40 per
cent higher than Italy and France, and four times the labour costs of
Portugal. This should make Germany very uncompetitive. But no, Germany still
has a very healthy trade surplus with the world and the UK shows a huge
deficit. Germany even has a trading surplus with Britain, which has been
rising again lately at an alarming rate.
Competitiveness depends on capital investment, R&amp;D, processes, management
qualities, work force attitude and skills, rather than on wage rates - in
other words, on overall productivity. UK companies believe they can
compensate for their lack of investment by focusing on labour costs. They
are forced into this position often by a harsh financial climate. While
Japanese and German companies pay shareholders on average less than 35 per
cent of profits and US firms pay 53 per cent, British companies have to fork
out a huge 70 per cent.
And when all else fails - as it always has and will do again - there is good
old devaluation to restore competitiveness for a while. But here lies a real
reason why the UK could not be in the exchange rate mechanism or become part
of a single currency Europe.
When my company, Jungheinrich, set up shop in Britain in 1967, the pound
stood at DM11.20, importers had between them less than 10 per cent of the UK
lift truck market and a healthy 60 per cent of British production went into
export. In 1994 the pound stands at barely DM2.50, imports are more than 60
per cent of the home market and the last remaining British-owned fork truck
maker, Lancer Boss, has been bought out of receivership by its German rival,
Jungheinrich.
A link between low wage cost, international competitiveness and long-term
success seems to me at best unproven and at worst to be more likely the
reverse.
Certainly the industrial world is changing and it is clear that the labour
market has to change with it. Flexible manufacturing, just-in-time and lean
production offer a system that is desirable from a micro-economic business
viewpoint. Raw materials and components arrive at the factory gates just in
time and products are no longer made for stock. It must be every
accountant's and production manager's dream to employ labour in the same
fashion. It is a quite effective system in the upward phase of a business
cycle. Companies hire more quickly, unrestricted by concerns over possible
later redundancy costs and time-consuming sacking procedures.
But the nightmare comes with the downward part of the business cycle:
redundancies will happen just as fast and on an increasing scale, leading to
macro-economic instability and an even crazier roller-coaster ride.
Britain's last recession produced 1.5m unemployed in little more than 2 1/2
years. There is good reason to believe the speed with which this happened
was influenced by the above trends. If such trends continue, Europe could
return to macro-economic instability. This would be forced by international
competition, the advance of information technology in production processes,
and governments' flight into deregulation (under pressure from business) in
its search for ways to combat unemployment.
The question is how to find a workable balance between micro-economic need
for flexibility and stability in the business cycle at the macro-economic
level. Germany has begun to address its excesses on the social front and
will also modify certain aspects of its over-regulated labour market.
Britain, coming from the completely opposite side, needs in many areas more,
not less, protection and regulation. It should try to learn from its
European neighbours. Being so often in a minority of one in Europe does not
happen by coincidence. It is invariably a sign of being wrong.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Wednesday's European Court judgements, coming on the last day of Britain's
European election campaign, could not have been better timed to provoke
maximum confusion. In fact none of them were unexpected and they are, with
some qualifications, to be welcomed. The decision to extend to employees who
are not in unions the right to be consulted in cases of redundancy and
business transfer is overdue. It was a Labour government which favoured
unions when transposing into national law the European requirement to
consult. But Conservative governments happily followed suit in European
legislation, as well as in domestic health and safety legislation.
A statutory right to consultation for all employees is, in principle, a big
step away from the British system of industrial relations and towards one
based on continental-style individual employee rights. Britain has in fact
been heading in this continental direction in recent years, based on the
belief that to have workplace rights mediated only by trade unions is
anachronistic. Moreover, the actual effect of the consultation ruling on
employers is likely to be small. It appears that employers will not have to
establish a prescribed mechanism for consulting but rather a procedure,
which allows a good deal of flexibility.
The danger is that the government will be tempted to transpose a minimalist
interpretation of the requirement to consult and so will risk opening a
fresh wave of Euro-litigation. This temptation must be avoided. If there is
any lesson to be drawn from the continuing chaos over the Transfer of
Undertakings (Protection of Employment) regulations, it is the importance of
realism. The government has good reason to object to Tupe - which
excessively protects jobs and conditions when businesses are transferred -
but pretending it does not apply in contracting-out cases has left
contractors as well as employees confused and angry.
The most grotesque misunderstanding is to suppose that this week's events
undermine Britain's 'opt-out' from the Social Chapter. In fact, this opt-out
relates only to future legislation; the matters which were the subject of
this week's court rulings arise from EC directives of the 1970s. The opt-out
may, in any case, become superfluous as the EU moves away from an
over-detailed and prescriptive approach to labour legislation. A
deregulatory tide is now running and even on Tupe there is a current in
favour of narrowing its scope to exclude at least some of the activities
covered by contracting out in Britain. That outcome has been helped by
Britain's constructive lobbying 'at the heart of Europe', not by opting out

FT  10 JUN 94 / Leading Article: Missing links
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
European Union finance ministers were right this week to rebuff a European
Commission proposal to issue 'Union bonds' to fund investment in large
cross-border infrastructure projects. The scheme is deeply flawed. However,
the debate it has stimulated offers an opportunity to explore more
constructive alternatives.
Union bonds, and the so-called trans-European networks they are supposed to
finance, owe much to the desire of Mr Jacques Delors, the commission
president, for a grand political initiative to fight recession and promote
European integration. But his proposals are unlikely to produce those
results.
At a time when national budgets are under severe strain, and the demands of
the public sector weigh heavily on European economies, the EU should think
carefully before embarking on a large amount of new borrowing. That might
fuel recent rises in long-term interest rates and make it harder for private
borrowers to obtain financing. If the EU needs extra funds, they should be
sought from the existing lending capacity of the European Investment Bank.
Nor has Brussels made a convincing case for its proposed infrastructure
projects. It says they will create cross-border links which member states
have had no incentive to provide in the past. However, that confuses cause
and effect. The priority sectors identified by Brussels -
telecommunications, surface transport and energy - have long been dominated
by national monopolies. Their myopia, conservatism and resistance to
competition - not market failure or lack of demand - are the main reason for
Europe's deficient cross-border infrastructure.
Too much of the spending envisaged by Mr Delors' plan would be channelled
through public sector bodies. As well as being inefficient, that could blunt
efforts to liberalise and privatise sectors, such as telecommunications and
energy. The EU should instead use trans-European networks to support those
goals by maximising the scope for competition and private sector
initiatives. These are the most cost-effective way to identify and achieve
worthwhile projects. In many promising areas, such as advanced information
highways, Europe's biggest handicap is not scarce capital, but
over-regulation, which has needlessly restricted opportunities for private
investment. The most important contribution Brussels can make is to keep
attacking those obstacles.
Imaginative and radical policy measures are needed to ensure that
trans-European networks are driven by the market, not by bureaucrats'
dreams. That way, the idea could breed innovation and enterprise, rather
than expensive white elephants.

FT  10 JUN 94 / Leading Article: The point of mutuality
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The British have always had an exaggerated view of the merits of home
ownership. Have they a similarly over-respectful view of mutual ownership in
the building society movement? It is tempting to think so after the High
Court's decision to throw obstacles in the path of Lloyds Bank's Pounds
1.8bn offer for the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society.
The 1986 Building Societies Act makes it exceptionally difficult for such
takeovers to proceed, even when agreed by the respective managements. In the
case of Lloyds, the specific stumbling block was a provision that prohibited
the payment of cash bonuses to investors of less than two years' standing.
The purpose of the legislation was not to block bids, but to prevent
speculative movements of funds from one society to another in anticipation
of bids. Yet Vice Chancellor Sir David Nicholls ruled the bonuses promised
to recent investors in Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester were unlawful. The question
is whether this legal logic makes public policy sense when the Treasury is
reviewing building society legislation.
To answer that question requires some prior consideration of the point of
mutuality. This form of ownership developed in the 19th century because it
enabled people to achieve goals that were not attainable via the commercial
banking system at the time. Today, with home ownership accounting for around
two-thirds of the housing stock, the purpose of the building society
movement is largely fulfilled.
The larger building societies no longer behave like mutual undertakings in
relation to their members. They are scarcely distinguishable in their
motivation and goals from the clearing banks. Indeed, some societies have
been harsher in their treatment of struggling mortgagors than the banks. And
they sometimes appear more interested in offering attractive deals to new
customers than looking after existing owners. This narrow pursuit of profit
is at odds with the concept of mutuality; and it remains unclear precisely
what the profits are for.
In one sense the societies are obeying the logic of the product market in
which they operate. Deregulation has given both societies and banks the
opportunity to engage in licensed poaching on each others' territory. Yet if
that is the case, why maintain an ownership and regulatory ring-fence around
institutions whose activities are converging with the wider business of the
banks?
One answer might be that in a plural system the building societies have
looked after their depositors with more imagination and flair than the
clearing banks have looked after theirs. The banks' record does not inspire
confidence in their ability to rejuvenate the more successful building
society sector. Both operate in imperfect markets in corporate control. Yet
below the very top level societies are subject to greater threat from
takeover than any bank and they cannot, under the 1986 Act, take over a big
clearing bank.
On balance, it seems sensible to continue to make it difficult for banks to
take over societies and to keep the societies from engaging in higher-risk
lending business until they can demonstrate the requisite skills. Determined
players with good lawyers will always find a way to consummate deals. What
cannot make sense is for investors who are not entitled to receive bonuses
to be given votes that enable them to block a bid that the majority desires.
This calls for legislative change, as does the present over-restrictive
approach to wholesale funding.

FT  10 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Obvious solution to choice of new
Euro-leader
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID EARNSHAW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It is unfortunate that your leader, 'How not to pick a Euro-leader'
(June 8), stops short of its logical conclusion. While quite rightly
criticising the current self-interested machinations of EU governments over
the choice of a successor to Jacques Delors, as well as the secrecy and
horse trading involved in making the choice and the absence of a clear idea
of the qualities required for the job, your leader failed to propose any
mechanism through which these failings could be rectified, now or in the
future.
The solution is obvious. According to the Maastricht treaty, the member
states are required to consult the newly-elected European parliament on its
nomination for Commission president. However, there is now a real
possibility that the European parliament, at its constituent session in
July, will be faced with the member governments having failed to make such a
nomination. In these circumstances it will be up to the parliament to fill
the political vacuum resulting from the (closed) vacillations of the EU's
governments.
The parliament could provide a forum in which the qualities, policy
preferences and independence of candidates would be examined and discussed,
in public. And a choice could even be made between candidates which would
reflect European public opinion as expressed in EU-wide elections only a
month previously.

FT  10 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Election opportunity wasted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr J M HARPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The European election campaign produced a disturbing symptom of British
insularity which we ignore at our peril.
All the evidence is that the European Parliament is rapidly becoming an
effective force. There is a series of really important and difficult issues
of European policy crying out for it to address. How is the European Union
going to handle future security problems on its doorstep such as Bosnia? How
protectionist should Europe be in the world after the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade? How is a long-run solution to be found to the problems of
European agriculture, which constantly clog the working of the Union? How
does the dirigiste concept of 'trans-European' networks for everything from
public administration through trunk roads to telecommunications (the latter
discussed in your admirable leader, 'Networking Europe', of 3 June) ride
with the ardent free market policies of some Commissioners? I am sure others
could think of many similar issues.
The attitudes of the new MEPs and their groupings towards these matters may
turn out to be formative for a large part of our future. Yet none of them
surfaced in the European election campaign in Britain. To the extent that it
dealt with European as distinct from domestic issues at all, it was a
collision between 'European' and 'Euro-sceptic' philosophies, with the
social chapter as a sort of chopping block.
An important opportunity to influence all our futures has simply been
wasted.

FT  10 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Unanimity a hindrance to OECD
progress
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr KARL A ZIEGLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your editorial, 'Future of the OECD' (June 7) comprehensively reviews
the group's historical evolution and its valued relevance to key
inter-governmental discussions on a wide range of topics.
However, as it expands to include important trading nations in eastern
Europe, south east Asia and Latin America, its effectiveness should not be
hindered by a requirement for unanimity in voting.
Such a process has condemned some important UN bodies to ineffectiveness,
historically, particularly when addressing an individual nation's errant
behaviour. A lowest common denominator of morality, by definition, is
usually not the best way forward.
To many businessmen active in today's international markets, a recent
announcement from the OECD must be extremely hopeful. The group's 24 member
states agreed to tackle the corrosive problem of international bribery, as
per David Buchan's report 'OECD members agree action to curb bribery of
foreign officials' (April 30). Full marks to the vision of the group's
current membership. Few issues deserve wider international attention.
The proliferation of bribery of decision-makers worldwide encourages wrong,
uneconomic choices while private and public morality suffer, particularly
among some of the world's poorest nations. Responsible leadership of
companies and nations everywhere would strive to set new stan-dards for the
way the world trades.

FT  10 JUN 94 / Shampoo and set in Russia: Christopher Parkes on a German
group's eastern hair care flair
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In Dzerzhinsk, on the outskirts of Nizhny Novgorod, stands a new-generation
Russian factory fortified in a style reminiscent of the old days when the
area - home to the Soviet Union's T-34 tank and MiG 29 warplane - was closed
to foreigners.
Ringed by a solid 3-metre-high concrete wall, electrified barbed wire,
floodlights, a no-go area of raked sand and a further wire fence inside the
main perimeter, Germany's Wella group goes about its day-to-day business:
making shampoo, conditioner and permanent wave lotion.
Mr Boris Nemtsov, regional governor, is ignoring the elaborate defences
erected to keep gangsters away from the German haircare group's DM25m
investment in the Russian chemicals industry. He is holding forth on the
'prejudice' disseminated by foreign media.
'I get a lot of information from the outside,' he says in perfect English.
He sees the FT, the Wall Street Journal and the Economist. He reads too much
about lawlessness, inflation and instability and not enough about the
advantages for potential investors.
'You can make profits here which you cannot dream of where you come from,'
he says, citing labour costs a tenth of those in Germany, and clamouring
demand for western-quality products.
As for the mafia, Russia is no worse than eastern Europe or New York: 'And
the way to deal with it is to improve the situation in the private sector,'
he says. 'When private banks first appeared in Russia they were full of
corruption and crime. But they organised their security privately and the
problem was no longer a problem,' he adds.
Mr Nemtsov, 34, a 'conservative' favourite of President Boris Yeltsin,
blessed with double-rations of energy and charisma, is guest of honour at
the official opening of the factory, a 50:50 joint venture between the
German group and Caprolactam, a sprawling Russian chemicals combine.
He seems put out that the size of the plant does not match his view of the
market potential. He waves his arm around the compound where the new
buildings occupy less than 20 per cent of the 50-hectare enclosure and where
new jobs have been found for just 130 of Caprolactam's bloated workforce of
13,000. 'If this factory were five times bigger Wella could supply the whole
market,' he says.
The joint venture, known as Capella, expects to break even on sales of
DM30m-plus in its first year. It is considering increasing capacity, and
plans to double turnover by 1996, presidential election year in Russia. Few
are tempted to look much further. 'We are in a country where you cannot do
much long-term planning,' says Mr Peter Zuhlsdorff, Wella chairman. 'Our
only navigational aid is the foghorn; they haven't got radar yet.'
Wella was first steered towards its Russian investment three years ago by
the presence in one of the last great potential markets of its global rivals
in haircare: Unilever, Procter &amp; Gamble and L'Oreal. Wella, which had
hitherto supplied the market through exports, also feared Russia might be
closed to non-essential imports.
It was guided towards Dzerzhinsk by a joint venture advisory agency set up
in 1991 by the Nizhny authorities and Germany's WestDeutsche Landesbank
shortly after the region was declared an experimental privatisation zone by
Mr Yeltsin.
Nizhny's importance as the Soviet weapons smithy meant it had above-average
(by Soviet standards) road and rail links. Caprolactam was once sole
supplier of a wide range of raw materials to the entire Soviet Union, and is
seeking more partners such as Wella - its first foreign collaborator - to
make added-value products with more appeal than its present range, which
includes linoleum and plastic funnels.
Lawlessness plus political and economic chaos entered Wella's calculations
but, Mr Zuhlsdorff says, the investment was based on business realities in
the global personal products market.
The company's situation in Russia is basically no different from its other
markets: balancing risks against opportunities and competing against global
rivals. 'What is going on here is the sharing-out of a new market,' says Mr
Zuhlsdorff. 'In the long run, not taking a chance now would involve us in
greater risks in the future.'
As for the security of his investment (Caprolactam provided the land and the
buildings), Mr Zuhlsdorff seems unconcerned. 'Our DM25m is not exactly
peanuts, but . . .' he says with a wry smile and a shrug. The message is
that it is an acceptable stake in the light of the potential offered by 150m
heads of Russian hair and ample evidence that local customers will pay for
western quality despite widespread poverty. Wella products, marketed in
Russia for the past 15 years, currently sell for about 90 per cent of German
retail prices.
That is a good enough start for him, and he sees Wella as established and
sure to gain. Only the extent of the gains and their timing is in doubt.
'There will not be a catastrophe,' he states. There may be years of
uncertainty. Growth may come in stops and starts or not at all for some
periods. 'But long term, (economic reform) will go on.'
Short term, formal distribution arrangements appear to be a concern because
the former state-run system has collapsed. Wella has tried to overcome this
by setting up a marketing joint venture with Caprolactam. This Moscow-based
company, Russwell, already has five wholesale distributors and 50 staff
building a chain of exclusive dealers.
At the same time, the group's Welonda shop-fitting subsidiary is opening
hair salons - a key outlet for the Wella brand - as quickly as it can find
joint-venture partners. There are now some 150 in Russia. The latest is in
the White House parliament building in Moscow, with two more planned for the
capital's Bolshoi Theatre and GUM department store.
Whatever Mr Nemtsov's reservations about the scale of the new factory, which
started production last autumn, the venture has restored Wella's fortunes in
a market where sales had virtually evaporated in 1992. Thanks to Capella's
output, bolstered by imports of hair colours and other more refined
products, Russia is again the group's biggest market in terms of turnover in
eastern Europe. Wella's handsome margins are being recycled into print and
broadcast media advertising.
And Mr Nemtsov, given to grand gestures and ambitions ('I am governor in
Nizhny just as President Clinton was governor in Arkansas') does not miss
the significance of Wella's initiative. 'Did you know how foreign investment
in Poland started? In the same way as here, with cosmetics.'
The Capella plant is a small but important addition to the 300-odd joint
ventures Mr Remtsov claims are under way in the region. But many more are
needed if Russia is to make a smooth transition to a market economy. 'We
need anything, any investors, anything that makes a profit.'

FT  10 JUN 94 / A hole in the middle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ask yourself the big question. How many Kellaways short of a party is Mr
Paddy Ashdown? Mr Alec Kellaway, you will have noticed, was until Wednesday
the Liberal Democratic candidate in the Newham North-east by-election. At
the last minute he had a fit of conscience and defected to Labour.
Correction. Not at precisely the last minute. The Kellaway conscience, it
appears from various accounts, spoke with finality last Sunday and the
bearer of it four days later. Further correction: Mr Kellaway, an economist
for 10 years at the Henley Centre for forecasting, did not, in his view,
defect. He 'returned home' to Labour. That is the party from which he had
previously defected to join the Social Democratic party, may it rest in
peace.
There is no need to hold up your hands in horror to protest that this is all
very confusing. Do not mock. The inference to draw from Mr Kellaway's little
drama is quite clear. The Labour party was rendered unelectable by the
schism of the early 1980s. In those days Labour was loony and left. Now it
is just about social democratic. It may be ready to welcome the return of
many of the voters it lost a decade ago. That would transform British
politics. We can be startlingly precise about how much room exists for such
a development. An entire trio of psephologists - Messrs Anthony Heath, Roger
Jowell and John Curtice - has reported in its latest study* that 42 per cent
of those who switched in 1983 from Labour to the Liberal-SDP alliance
returned to Labour in April 1992. Some 12 per cent of respondents to the
same questionnaire had moved to the Conservatives, while 36 per cent were
still voting Liberal Democrat. That is a great many Kellaways to play for.
Mr Ashdown, the third party's leader, would be the first to recognise this
disturbing truth.
It is possible, indeed likely, that Mr Kellaway himself is an isolated case.
We do not expect Liberal Democratic candidates to leap off the hustings in
the final hours of all future contests. Against that, a shadow has fallen
over what should have been the happy counting of votes cast for those
Liberal Democrats who did stay the course yesterday. The victors in the five
by-elections will be known this morning. The results of the elections to the
European Parliament will be announced after the weekend. A few days ago Mr
Ashdown might reasonably have expected people to be talking his party's
prospects up on Monday. Now there will be doubt. How many Kellaway
consciences will strike before the next general election? There is plenty of
time for that 36 per cent to trickle over. The government could hang on
until 1997, if it had to.
Much depends on the outcome of the Labour leadership contest that begins
this morning. If either Mr John Prescott or Mrs Margaret Beckett wins
control of the people's party, the Liberal Democrats can breathe again. It
would not surprise me if in those circumstances Mr Kellaway re-Kellawayed.
If, however, Mr Tony Blair wins, and does so in the proper manner, Mr
Ashdown may have reason to tremble. The manner of a Blair victory is as
important in this reckoning as would be the triumph itself. Labour must
convince the watching public that it is ready to welcome alliance defectors
back. Mr Blair entered Parliament in 1983, after the great schism. He has no
reason to harbour old hatreds as, it seems, does his lieutenant, Mr Jack
Straw. He starts off free to deal with the Lib Dems, or absorb them. He will
achieve none of this if he wins by pandering to the left of his party, or if
he kowtows to trade union barons who cannot accustom themselves to their
diminished status in British society.
Those who question the need to win converts from other parties should turn
again to Messrs Heath, Jowell and Curtice. They demonstrate that even in the
most propitious circumstances Labour will need a larger accretion of support
than it has ever achieved at a single general election since 1945 if it is
to win an overall majority. Destroying the Tory majority, and thus creating
a hung parliament, would be easier. Any Labour leader would, however, regard
that as second best. It would make it necessary to do a post-election deal
with Mr Ashdown.
Mr Blair must therefore ask himself whether an unprecedentedly large swing
to Labour is achievable. In a paper prepared for Kleinwort Benson**, Mr
Curtice and a colleague, Mr Peter Spencer, intimate that it might be. They
run most conventional economic variables through their model and emerge with
what they should have called political disaster theory. The Conservatives
are deeply unpopular because of the chaos in their party and their
government that followed sterling's sudden ejection from the exchange rate
mechanism on Black Wednesday. Labour suffered similarly after the
devaluation of the pound in 1967 and the payments crisis of 1976.
Plainly, political performance does matter. In April 1992 many of us found
it difficult to believe that the Conservatives would win, since Britain was
at the bottom of a deep recession. In the event, persistent mistrust of
Labour did the trick for the Tories. For the past two years the
Conservatives have been carrying on like a party on its way out, but the
government could yet improve its performance. There is time in which the
memories of Black Wednesday and its aftermath might be erased. A period of
consolidation would help. Some people think the Tories will win anyway, on
the ground that the public in Britain, as in other western countries, is
just as fed up with the opposition as it is with the government. Only a new
face, like that of Mr Berlusconi in Italy or Mr Ross Perot in the US, could
make a difference.
The leadership contest gives Labour the chance to present the next best
thing to a new face. A thoroughly modernised party, with clear policies and
a coherent economic strategy is also required. If such a package is on
offer, Mr Ashdown could find that this weekend marks the apogee of his
party's performance. Total modernisation is a great deal to ask of Labour,
but the alternative could be a fifth victory for the Conservatives. Many of
us, Tories included, shudder at that prospect.

Sir, In his article, 'Hand-up, not hand-out' (June 7), Joe Rogaly says 'you
have to settle for less regulation and less welfare if you want more people
in jobs'.
This appears to overlook the little matter of money - and it is no little
matter, not only to the employers and employees but to the government. If
you wish to hire a machine you are free to do so provided you pay 17.5 per
cent VAT for the privilege. Hire a human being on the other hand and the
freedom comes at a much higher price. Wrapped up in three slices comprising
Pay as You Earn and employee's and employer's national insurance
contributions the rates may not look too bad. But combine them and express
the total tax as a percentage of the net wage and you have a figure which
could surely satisfy all but the most grasping of tyrants.
For example, at a nominal (or gross) wage of only Pounds 15,000 a year 49.3
per cent of the net wage of Pounds 11,090 is effectively levied by the
government as taxation, resulting in the employer having to pay a total of
Pounds 16,560.
Is it any wonder that, with tax at this sort of level on relatively low
incomes, more and more businessmen prefer part-time employees, especially if
they are below the tax thresholds?
Alternatively, in the case of goods, arrangements can be made to make them
abroad; and, in the case of services, the customers can be employed, free of
tax, to serve themselves (self-service), or do the work themselves (DIY).
How can any hand-up, as suggested by Rogaly, have any more than a cosmetic
effect when compared to the 'push-down' consequences of such onerous tax?
After all, we are talking about tens of billions of pounds that are being
charged for the right to work. This must have, must it not, some effect on
the labour market, unless 2 and 2 no longer make 4?

FT  10 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: No large illegal movement of
Bangladeshis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr SHEHABUDDIN AHMED
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Thank you for your survey on Bangladesh (May 9) focusing on
Bangladesh's march towards the 21st century and for Sheila Jones's article,
'When the Ganges runs dry', on the 'life-and death crisis' of Bangladesh
trying to get its share of the Ganges water denied it by its big neighbour,
India. However, I would point out one slip in this article.
Without attributing any sources, Sheila Jones writes that 'the only pressure
on Delhi is the illegal movement of about 10m Bangladeshis across the border
in the past 20 years'.
This is not correct. We emphatically say that there has not been any illegal
movement of people, not to mention the huge number of people Sheila Jones
suggests were moving to India to 'escape poverty in Bangladesh'. The
unilateral withdrawal of Ganges water by India has brought about drought,
ecological imbalance and demographic changes in Bangladesh causing misery to
millions of people.

FT  10 JUN 94 / Arts: A 'Jenufa' ill served by production - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Janacek's fine, morally penetrating opera is proof against almost anything,
and it easily survives Lucy Bailey's amateurish new production at the
Coliseum. Jenufa is the first of his mature operas, but the last now to
enter the English National Opera repertoire, after David Pountney's often
inspired versions of the other six. Luckily it boasts an excellent cast,
though they have been given precious little help; it will undoubtedly run
better, or at least limp less painfully, when it has been run in.
Two years ago Miss Bailey devised a beautiful, dream-like staging for
Giorgio Battistelli's Teorema (after Pasolini's film and novel) which was
universally admired. Not so her production of Paisiello's Barbiere at
Wexford last year; and now Jenufa - inescapably naturalistic,
village-domestic, red-blooded - catches her without the elementary skill of
animating her performers. They stand, or sit, awkwardly about. Their
exchanges are lame, under-defined. There is nothing for it but to Emote on
the spot, which they all do to their hopeful best.
Even Josephine Barstow's Kostelnicka seems to be trapped in a neck-brace
throughout, and at her great crises she is reduced to repetitive
arm-twitches. Can this be Janacek's formidable matriarch, whose model - as
we learn from the ENO programme-book, excellent as usual - was a notable
singer and dancer with 'a vital energy, a harmony of movement and an
elevated bearing'? The Kostelnicka is not the crabbed, hypocritical
Kabanicha of Katya. When she sings, Miss Barstow's intensity of
understanding is marvellous, but the voice has to do all the work.
Susan Bullock's sweet, touchingly gawky Jenufa is in a similar fix, rescued
by her transparent honesty. David Maxwell Anderson's natural assets make him
an admirably flash, flamboyant, feckless Steva, with a big, handsome voice
to match. Best of all is Kim Begley as his half-brother Laca. Miss Bailey
hobbles him, too - but he is visibly, sympathetically choked with his
frustrated love and his strange private anger, and delivers his music with
seething passion and an unyielding grip on its expressive sense.
Shelagh Squires' Grandmother Burya wears a gentle dignity that makes its own
mark, and Arwel Huw Morgan's warm, kindly Foreman is faultless. The boy Jano
is almost completely unintelligible, even in his crucial report of the
discovery of the dead baby. Nicholas Folwell's nice study of the Mayor is
not parodied; he is more fortunate than his wife and daughter, whose
costumes make them instant travesties.
In fact Simon Vincenzi's costumes reach their ghastly nadir in that final
act. From the random dress of the villagers at the start, one supposed that
he was eschewing anything recognisably Czech; but for the wedding he
descends into queasy, milk-and-water ethnic caricature. Likewise, the
choreographer Leah Hausman follows her lively, plausible dances for the
first act with an excessively twee little number for the wedding, too mimsy
to be ironical.
Otherwise, Miss Bailey's handling of the village crowds is pure village-hall
theatre, stiff and limp at once. The whole production might be regarded as a
piece of 'conceptual art', in the sense that it doesn't look very good, nor
interesting, but is more or less 'explained' by her remarks printed in the
programme-book.
A large, blank screen overhangs the stage, lit in various colours at
different times: that must be the 'crushing' sky which symbolises Jenufa's
'confined' life. I was less sure about the swelling sea of hip-high yellow
flowers that is the sole ornament of Act 1. The expansion of the bleak
little cottage room of Act 2 into an Act 3 space, so as to accommodate the
wedding guests, looks like crude makeshift.
Young Sian Edwards conducts. She is not, of course, Charles Mackerras or
Bernard Haitink or Mark Elder; she brings her own eager rush to the score,
but one misses Janacek's serene warmth and breadth (and any intimate rapport
with the singers). All of this noble music amounts to a kind of ethical
commentary on the action, wise, elevated and tender; it is always more than
mere reflection of the characters' transient feelings. So far, Miss Edwards
makes distinctly less of it than that: the glorious transforming close
sounds like no more than strenuous jubilation.

FT  10 JUN 94 / Arts: Soul-paring style - Nigel Andrews talks to the Polish
film director Krzysztof Kieslowski
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The biggest shock at last month's Cannes festival, apart from the film that
won the main prize, Pulp Fiction, was the film that won no prize at all.
Krzysztof Kieslowski's Three Colours Red, the critics' favourite, was passed
over by the ruthless Clint Eastwood Gang - aka the Cannes jury - thus
robbing the Polish-born director of the 'grand slam' that seemed his for the
taking after earlier prizes for Blue (Venice) and White (Berlin).
It was at Berlin, just before he won his Best Director Silver Bear, that he
and I met and talked amid an earlier hail of Kieslowski headlines. Had he
really decided to stop making films, I ask, through an interpreter.
'I hope. Yes.'
But you are the most acclaimed film-maker in Europe?
'Maybe it's the best moment because of that.'
What will you do instead?
'Nothing special.'
It is like talking to Leonardo da Vinci as he fondles an early pair of
retirement slippers. Kieslowski's films have been the glory - it often seems
the sole glory - of European cinema since the mid-1980s. When A Short Film
About Killing premiered in Cannes in 1988, this literally tiny feature
(70-something minutes) raised scalp hairs across the entire town. The poetry
of nightmare - a vicious murder, a more vicious execution, a series of
cityscapes shot in bilious-yellow or acid-blue filters - was joined to a
forlorn, ironic compassion.
Later works - A Short Film About Love, The Double Life Of Veronique - took
that soul-paring style and added bits of comedy and fantasy, even mangy
lyricism. But a Kieslowski film is still unmistakable. It is moviedom's
answer to Munch's The Scream: a silent yell offered over the death-throes -
which some in the director's view foolishly mistake for life-throes - of
Europe at the end of the millennium.
His latest and threatened last work is his French-co-funded trilogy based on
tricouleur themes. As in Decalogue, his TV-commissioned series where each
short film was based on one of the ten commandments, Kieslowski likes to
fool audiences into expecting neatly tailored thesis movies. But Blue was
about the 'liberty' of a woman in shock after the death of her husband and
child in a car crash; and White (equality) and Red (fraternity) are wry,
lateral reflections on the other great abstracts in the French revolutionary
triad.
Kieslowski insists that the films are about people anyway, not society or
politics: even though White, opening in London today, cocks a snook at the
new capitalism in eastern Europe, with its tale of a get-rich Pole using
black market scams to lure his estranged French wife to Warsaw, and Red is
set in bureaucratic, icy-hearted Switzerland.
'I do not believe in society,' he states. 'Society is composed of millions
of individuals and those individuals interest me.' Didn't Mrs Thatcher once
say the same thing? 'But for her it had a political dimension. That is the
difference. In her mouth it does not make sense at all, because looked at
politically and socially of course societies exist.'
But not, he implies, for the artist. And for film-makers the advantage of a
Europe now collapsing into semi-federalism is that they can ignore such
divides as do remain between countries and cultures. Co-production heaven
has arrived, and much of Kieslowski's recent work, starting with Veronique,
has been made with French actors in French settings in the French language.
'It's practically impossible to understand other countries than your own.
But if you are talking about people, that doesn't matter. A human being is
not a country. Foreign actors bring something truthful about their country
into my film; they carry that truth inside them. So I'm not obliged to smell
the air in this other land, because the actors know and breathe it . . .'
And in any case the country where this director's films are really set is
Kieslowskiland. Like Greeneland it has its own moods, rules and landscapes:
though in typical style the director disclaims credit for most of the
characterising devices you quote back at him, from his use of filters to his
way with recurring symbolism.
'The three films using filters (Veronique, Blue, Red) were made by the same
director of photography. It was his idea. I just said yes or no.' And the
symbolic motifs? Like the old person straining to put a bottle in a street
bottle-bank, a vignette that occurs in each of the three trilogy films. Or
the almost sinister use of small animals, like the mice in Blue and the
fluttering pigeons in White.
The bottle bank scene, he says, is about failing powers. 'It's our future.
Simply, there will come a day for each of us when we won't be able to push a
bottle in]' And the animals? 'We had the idea that in all three films you
would see an animal giving birth. We did it with mice in Blue, we wanted to
do the same with pigeons in White. But it's difficult to get pigeons to nest
their eggs in February. So to get something similar, we had the idea of this
'fluttering' motif. You make certain associations with it.'
Kieslowski prefers to let his audience construe the scenes. He does not
believe in a single definitive interpretation of a film; he does not even
believe in a single definitive version of any film.
Having already played with flexiform movies in A Short Film About Killing
and A Short Film About Love, each made with two separate running times, one
for cinemas, one for TV, what he would next like is for films to be shaped
differently for every different screening venue.
'If you're in a big cinema you're sitting in a comfortable chair and the
place is full of people. It becomes a totally different film from the same
one you'll see in a little village hall with poor screening: the image will
be dark, the sound not perfect, you'll be almost alone. Same reels,
different film] Because a movie acts in contact with you. Are you in a good
mood or bad? Are you crossing the Atlantic? Why not introduce those
differences, or respond to the possibility of them, within the film itself?'
I am fascinated. Can he elaborate? No. My time is up. Berlin is a busy
place, especially for a famous abdicating film-maker.

As they say on Radio 2, Friday Night Is Music Night. The programme of that
name offers middle-of-the-road popular music from the BBC Concert Orchestra
(7.30). There is a huge range of other music on offer elsewhere. Also at
7.30 Radio 3 begins its relay of the opening concert in the 1994 Aldeburgh
Festival with Britten's 'Sinfonia da Requiem', Stravinsky's 'The Flood', and
Mahler's 'Totenfeier'. If your taste is for more popular classical music the
Evening Concert on Classic FM at 8.00 provides Britten's 'Young Person's
Guide To The Orchestra', Arensky's 'Variations On A Theme Of Tchaikovsky',
and Rachmaninov's 'Rhapsody On A Theme Of Paganini'. At 10.00 John Peel
begins three hours of rock music from Tilburg, Holland, on Radio 1. If light
entertainment is your requirement from television on a Friday night, there
is a repeat of Red Dwarf, (9.00 BBC2) a situation comedy with an unusual
situation (deep space); the topical quiz show Have I Got News For You (10.00
BBC2); and Viva Cabaret on C4 which features some pretty appalling acts but
also Gayle Tuesday, a funny stand-up comedian (10.30).

FT  10 JUN 94 / Arts: Sharp little shocker - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Since Peter Maxwell Davies wrote The Lighthouse 14 years ago, the little
opera has had many more performances abroad than here. The Music Theatre
Wales revival, brought from Stuttgart and Swansea to the Queen Elizabeth
Hall on Tuesday, is not only timely - Max's 60th birthday is approaching -
but highly expert and effective. It goes to the Oxford Playhouse this
Sunday, and the Cheltenham Everyman on July 10; there will be a further tour
in the autumn.
The tale was inspired by a real-life 1900 mystery, the disappearance of all
three keepers from the Flannan Isle lighthouse - leaving everything behind
in perfect order, 'Marie Celeste'-style. In the Davies scenario there are
burgeoning psychological frictions between them, shut up together as they
are. As nerves become rawer, there are confessional reminiscences, and
ultimately an explosive folie a trois.
Before this main act, 'The Cry of the Beast', comes a shorter Prologue in
which the same three singers are impersonal officers giving evidence at the
later court of enquiry (enlivened by stage flashbacks). Davies exploits the
parallelism neatly: indeed, the construction of the entire piece is notably
taut and clever: the keepers' warring characters touched in by economical
strokes, the spooky atmosphere generated by a mere dozen players with a
kaleidoscopic variety of colour and attack.
Michael Rafferty conducts with a sure hand, and Michael McCarthy's
production is no less confident. Simon Banham's skeletal light-house makes a
perfect setting. The trio of singer-actors is first-rate: Henry Herford as
the volatile Blazes, hag-ridden by a brutal childhood, Philip Creasy's naive
Sandy, Kelvin Thomas's religious nut Arthur. At the climaxes of both acts,
however, Ace McCarron's bold lighting goes so far over the top that many of
us shut our eyes tight while it lasted  - not a dramatic effect, just
physiological.
Certainly Maxwell Davies' score enriches the schematic action. It focuses
it, orders it, lends it a fine haunted aura. Whether it deepens it is
another matter. Significantly, each light-keeper's revelatory monologue is
set as a parody in Max's 1970s vein - a gleefully black G. &amp; S. number, a
soulful Edwardian ballad, a Sally Army hymn. His favourite tics of that time
recur: the mistuned upright piano, the lightly sinister celesta and
marimbas, the hyper-vibrato solos for mawkish brass.
By the time the really distressful exposures begin, the music is too far
into Hammer-film horror (long, shivery string tremoli, muffled threats in
the bass, snapping percussion) to do anything more for the individual
characters. The net effect is of a shaggy-dog story recounted as Grand
Guignol. For practical reasons, MTW has preferred to insert an interval
between prologue and main act; but that leaves the opera somewhat
over-stretched, prompts expectations of something more searching than it
pretends to deliver.
At a dense, continuous hour-and-a-quarter it would display its astringent
virtues still better. A one-acter need not aim at the psychological depths
that an evening's-length opera might explore. There are different things to
be done on the narrower scale: think of what Ravel managed with L'Heure
espagnole, a mere 'vaudeville'] In The Lighthouse, Maxwell Davies does some
of them with such lean, incisive brilliance that it may prove to outlast
grander pieces with more humane ambitions.

FT  10 JUN 94 / Technology: Flights of fancy put safety first - Increasingly
sophisticated aircraft simulators are becoming more like the real thing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Flying conditions around Seattle were far from ideal on the last day of May.
The area was blanketed with snow and a strong wind was gusting as the pilot
lined up his Boeing 777 for a tricky landing at the aircraft maker's
airfield on the outskirts of the city.
The aircraft descended steadily towards the parallel beads of runway lights
blinking in the distance. But just before touchdown, green-grey patches of
ice became visible on the tarmac. Some of the aircraft's tyres failed to
grip the surface. The nose lurched from side to side as the pilot struggled
to bring the aircraft to an unsteady stop.
This story has some obvious flaws. The chances of finding snow in Seattle on
May 31 are almost zero. What is more, the twin-engined Boeing 777 has yet to
fly. Its maiden flight is expected to take place within the next few days,
with customer deliveries due to start only in May 1995. But Boeing's
test-pilots have been notching up flying hours on the 777 for the past six
months thanks to a simulator at CAE Electronics' factory in Montreal.
Without leaving the ground, the pilots have flown in and out of airports
around the world, experiencing the sights, sounds and turbulence of
snowstorms, thunderstorms, air pockets and almost every other flying
condition.
CAE Electronics, a division of CAE of Toronto, claims a 50 per cent share of
the world market for aircraft simulators, including 10 of the 13 orders
placed so far for Boeing 777 devices. The other three 777 orders have gone
to CAE's main rival, Rediffusion, a UK-based division of Thomson, the French
electronics group.
Like the aircraft they reproduce, simulators have grown increasingly
sophisticated. Pilots' experience on a simulator now helps decide which
systems and instruments are installed in a new aircraft. 'We fly our
simulators before Boeing flies its planes,' says Adrian Gale, CAE
Electronics' marketing director. 'We'll pick up bugs on an avionics sweep
before Boeing does.'
But the technological advances have one drawback: as the simulator
experience gets closer to the real thing, so does its price. One of CAE's
full-flight simulators currently costs about CDollars 15m (Pounds 7.2m) to
Dollars 20m.
As a result, airlines are turning to simplified versions, known as flight
training devices (FTDs). These recreate specific parts of an aircraft's
system without the frills and thrills of a real flight. For instance,
maintenance system trainers, comprising little more than two chairs, two
computer screens and a console, reproduce only those instruments needed for
engineers to diagnose an aircraft's inner workings from the cockpit.
Full-flight simulators, which look like windowless space capsules, do much
more than reproduce an aircraft's cockpit and instruments.
Hydraulically-powered struts which form the base of the simulator can propel
the bulbous module in six directions, including a pitch and roll of up to
30'.
Simulator makers go to extraordinary lengths to make flights on their
machines as close to the real thing as possible. One of CAE's helicopter
simulators is fitted with a shaking pilot's seat as well as the normal
banking, pitching and rolling mechanisms. By pumping air into cushions
behind and underneath a fighter pilot's seat, CAE mimics the G-forces felt
in steep climbs and tight turns. Take-offs and landings feature appropriate
real-time bumps and engine sounds.
The biggest advance in recent years, however, has been in the
computer-generated visual systems which project images of airports,
landmarks, scenery and weather conditions likely to be encountered during a
flight.
The latest version of CAE's Maxvue visual system, installed in the 777, has
five separate channels giving a total horizontal field of vision of 210' and
a vertical field of 40'. The pilot and co-pilot can thus see true-to-life
images out of all the cockpit windows. When taxiing, for instance, they can
see another aircraft approaching from the side. The vertical view allows
them to see slightly above and below the plane, which is especially useful
in banking manoeuvres. CAE has fitted its helicopter simulators with two
extra channels to give a straight-down view.
CAE has developed visual-system databases for almost 40 airports around the
world. Each one, taking up 5 gigabytes of disk storage, reproduces the
topography and landmarks within a 15-mile radius of the airport and, in much
greater detail, its runways and terminal buildings.
The database is compiled from digitised satellite and aerial photos and
maps. These are augmented with on-the-spot observations by the software
experts who design the system and suggestions from the pilots who will use
it. Few details have been forgotten. The wind sock at the end of the runway
in Hong Kong billows in the same direction as the wind registered on the
cockpit instruments. The rotors of a hovering helicopter churn up the sea
below.
But computer-generated scenery has its limitations. CAE has yet to master
three-dimensional imaging, and the sharpness of the pictures does not match
the human eye. Although the number of polygons (or shapes) which can be
fitted on each channel has jumped from 1,000 to about 5,500 in the past
three or four years, this is still not enough to cover every detail.
Customers thus have to make choices. The criterion, often a subjective one,
is what is of most importance to the pilot. As the Boeing 777 descends over
Seattle, the city's Space Needle tower and the main highways are clearly
visible from the cockpit. But there are no cars on the roads. The scene may
be surreal, but it is a comforting reminder that no matter how bad the
weather conditions outside, this flight will be landing safely.

FT  10 JUN 94 / Technology: Census on CD-Rom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To those who fill out the forms, censuses are a chore. To those processing
the information, they are a rich source of information about how people live
and work.
But to commercial users of the data, the 10-yearly census counts can be an
aid to higher profits and lower costs. Supermarkets can work out where to
put new branches, companies can assess which areas should produce the best
response to direct marketing campaigns and public authorities can decide
where to site hospitals, old people's homes or council housing.
'It's a big market place,' says Susan Squires, product development director
of Capscan, a London-based company specialising in address and census data.
Advances in computer power mean census data can now be used more
comprehensively and rapidly than before.
Next week, Capscan launches a CD-Rom containing all the 1991 statistics,
broken down into about 150,000 small areas (each containing 200 households).
By compressing the data, Capscan can make available this information which
was stored on 200 magnetic tapes. It takes account of 9,000 variables,
derived from cross-referencing answers to questions on such matters as
accommodation, family, cars and occupational status; they show how each area
breaks down demographically.
The data excludes names, addresses or incomes, and the published information
is altered minutely to prevent identification. Even so, it is a potential
gold-mine for businesses wanting to know more about their market place.
Capscan's CD-Rom, called Cenario, allows users to obtain easy access to this
data on desktop computers and link it to maps and postcodes.
'Our objective is to demystify access to the census,' says Squires. The CD
costs Pounds 3,000 but Capscan charges extra for data beyond the first of
its three access levels.

FT  10 JUN 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Low prices for colour LCDs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Buyers of notebook computers now expect colour liquid crystal displays. The
leading technology - active Thin Film Transistor (TFT) - gives excellent
performance but at a high price: TFT displays cost at least Dollars 1,200
(Pounds 800) each, even when ordered in large numbers. Electronics companies
are therefore racing to develop cheaper LCDs without sacrificing too much
contrast and speed.
Hitachi of Japan has a range of new displays, based on the passive Super
Twisted Nematic technology used conventionally for monochrome LCDs. Their
contrast ratio is only 25:1, compared with almost 100:1 for TFT, and their
response time is 0.27 sec rather than 0.05 sec. But the company says this
performance is more than adequate for applications where a low price is
paramount. Hitachi's new displays cost about Dollars 600 each for bulk
orders.

FT  10 JUN 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Consensus at the Science Museum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The general public normally plays little part in the development of science
and technology policy. In an attempt to show that lay people can become more
involved, the Science Museum in London is organising a Consensus Conference,
in which a panel of non-scientists will produce a report on the future of
plant biotechnology.
Over the next two months, the museum will select 16 people with the widest
possible range of professional and social backgrounds, by advertising
through local newspapers and radio stations. The panel will meet over two
weekends, to define the issues and debate the risks and benefits of using
plants in new ways in agriculture, food, industry and medicine. Then, at the
conference itself in November, it will cross-question expert witnesses and
hold a public debate, before preparing the final Consensus Report.
The concept of a lay consensus conference originated in the US and has been
developed further in the Netherlands and Denmark. The Biotechnology and
Biological Sciences Research Council, which is funding the Science Museum
conference, says it will be the first UK example.

FT  10 JUN 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Rich pickings in rare elements
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rare earth elements have always been at the obscure end of the chemicals
industry. They are expensive to produce and have few discernable large-scale
applications. But French company Rhone-Poulenc, which has long championed
their use, has developed a rare earth compound, cerium sulphide, as a
pigment for plastics, Daniel Green writes.
The three-year development programme was aimed at finding an alternative to
cadmium sulphide, which is tainted by concerns over the toxicity of cadmium.
The company is using cerium because the sulphide, like that for cadmium, is
red. In various mixtures it can be made to show a variety of shades from
orange to crimson.

FT  10 JUN 94 / People: Curriculum proves vital for Woodhead
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Chris Woodhead is about to take on his second Herculean educational task in
little over a year. John Patten, the education secretary, has nominated him
for the post of HM Chief Inspector of Schools - arguably the second most
powerful job in English education.
The job will require Woodhead to run the Office of Standards in Education
(Ofsted), a non-ministerial government department which has just started a
controversial system for inspecting every state school at least once every
four years, using lay inspectors.
Although his appointment starts on September 1, he will not be able to give
it his undiluted energy until he has finished his present job - slimming
down the national curriculum for England and Wales.
As chief executive of the Schools Curriculum and Assessment Authority, it
has fallen to Woodhead to carry out the review which has been headed in
masterful style by Sir Ron Dearing. The task of getting large groups of
academics to agree on lopping a fifth of the content from the curriculum was
never going to be easy, and some teachers on SCAA's working groups -
particularly in English and History - have publicly dissented from final
proposals.
They claim that the authority's officials had dominated the process.
However, the review has been completed according to timetable, and ministers
are happy with the way the task has been handled - as Woodhead's appointment
demonstrates.
Woodhead's promotion is the latest in a startling series. A graduate of
Bristol and Keele, he taught English in secondary schools before moving into
local government in 1982 - not usually a springboard for advancement in
central government circles. As recently as 1990, he was deputy chief
education officer for Cornwall County Council.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Tony Allen, former chief executive of Berkshire county council, is to become
the new chief executive of the National House-Building Council, the
self-regulatory body of the house-building industry. He will succeed Basil
Bean who retires at the end of September.
Allen, 54, has been a consultant on market-testing and the management of
change in the public sector since leaving Berkshire at the end of November.
During his tenure, the council pioneered contracting-out of services to the
private sector, putting even core activities such as planning and financial
services out to tender. Since April, he has been special adviser to Michael
Heseltine, Trade and Industry secretary, working on contracting-out and the
privatisation of the DTI's agencies.
A solicitor by training, Allen has spent most of his working life in local
government. His career included spells with Coventry, Lewisham and Southwark
and he was chief executive at the London borough of Hammersmith and Fulham
before moving to Berkshire.
Between 1979 and 1986 he was responsible for the organisation and
development of the London Youth Games and remains a director of London Youth
Games Limited. He chaired the local authorities' disaster working party for
the Department of Health and is a member of the British Standards
Institution.

FT  10 JUN 94 / People: Salomon sends Berens to UK
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Salomon Brothers is sending one of its biggest hitters to London as part of
its drive to raise the firm's profile in European equity markets. Rodney
Berens, 48, a member of Salomon Brothers' 12-strong executive committee, is
currently co-head of the US equity department with Bruce Hackett.
Stephen Posford, chief executive officer of Salomon Brothers' European
operations, is looking forward to working with Berens to come up with a
winning formula to make Salomon as well known in the equities business as it
is in fixed-income and derivatives.
'It won't be a bums-on-seats strategy,' says Posford. Rather, the emphasis
will be on sector-driven research and close co-ordination between Salomon's
European operations and the US investment banking arm. Berens will also
provide valuable access to Salomon's equity salesforce in New York, Posford
adds.
Berens is expected to spend a good part of each month in London over the
summer but crucial decisions such as his children's education are likely to
delay his transfer until the end of the year. Before joining Salomon in 1992
in the wake of the Treasury scandal, he was in charge of global research at
Morgan Stanley.

FT  10 JUN 94 / People: Hambro breaks links in its chain
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Harry Hill, 46, formerly joint managing director, has moved up to become
sole group managing director of Hambro Countrywide, the estate agent and
financial services chain in which Hambros has a stake.
His erstwhile partner as joint managing director, John May, 39, is
transferring within the Hambros group, to take up a post as deputy chairman
and managing director of Hambro Group Investments.
The move thus ends a joint managerial partnership at Hambro Countrywide
which stretches back to November 1988. Hambro Countrywide returned to profit
in its last annual results, reported in March this year. The 445-strong
agency chain increased its commission income from Pounds 52.9m to Pounds
64.4m, turning a 1992 loss of Pounds 1.6m to Pounds 15.8m profit for the
financial year of 1993.
Christopher Sporborg, Hambro Countrywide's chairman, said yesterday that
May's shift of post was entirely related to internal restructurings at the
company, which had seen the financial products' division - for which May had
been responsible - being brought under the aegis of the agency division,
rather more the responsibility of Harry Hill.
A key element of May's role having so significantly changed, Sporborg added
that 'I did need to have him (May) here. Because of the changes at Hambro
Countrywide, I met less resistance than I would have had two years ago.'
Sporborg says May will remain a non-executive director of Hambro
Countrywide, and will 'chair a strategy committee there. I think the move
strengthens Hambro Insurance Services group, without weakening Hambro
Countrywide'.

FT  10 JUN 94 / Management: A better type of opinion survey - Catch-phrases
are the best clue to what people really think
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ADRIAN FURNHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Polls show the public to be hypocritical and contradictory in their
opinions.
In that possibly portentous BBC mini-saga To Play the King, the fictional
Prime Minister's rather-too-sexy 'adviser' pointed out that by subtle
wording of opinion-poll questions, one could always obtain the results one
wanted.
Managers increasingly commission climate and culture surveys that require
employees to agree or disagree with various statements about their
perception of the company. Can these questions be skilfully worded to give
the answers they want to hear? And how do employees react when they can 'see
through' the motives of the questionnaire and don't agree with its point of
view?
Consider opinion polls about tax. Almost everyone believes they are being
overtaxed and that taxation should be reduced; but at the same time everyone
wants more money spent on health, education and crime prevention.
One could argue that these ideas are not incompatible. For instance, the
government could increase indirect taxation as opposed to income tax, to
raise revenue while leaving people more discretion to spend as they wish.
Or one could argue that 'the rich' should be heavily taxed, but not oneself.
This 'politics-of-envy' thinking is very popular in Britain because whoever
you are, you never include yourself among those to be taxed more highly.
But alas the great British public - or any public for that matter - are not
so sophisticated. Various studies have shown that in opinion surveys people
are contradictory. For example, an American polling company reported that 63
per cent of people agreed with the view that: 'When 12,000 air-traffic
controllers are willing to sacrifice their careers and economic security,
and even go to jail, there must be some legitimate reasons for going on
strike'.
The same poll found that 69 per cent supported the opinion that: 'Since
every air-traffic controller took an oath not to strike, President Reagan
was right to fire them.' Obviously, a lot of people must have agreed with
both statements, revealing nothing about whether they supported the strike.
The writing of opinion items, then, is itself highly political and it is not
good science. So some psychologists have cast about for other approaches.
One solution was to reduce the item down to its central core, adopting a
familiar catch-phrase to represent the issue, and reserving all evaluation
for the response alternatives. The formula 'X is a good/bad thing
considering Y and Z' (agree or disagree?) was replaced by the simpler
formula: ''X' (good or bad?)'. This, they believed, would tap immediate
emotional reactions to controversial issues, and would be closer to actual
behavioural dispositions.
The technique is to abandon the propositional form of an item, and instead
simply present a list of brief labels or 'catch-phrases' representing
various familiar and controversial issues.
It is assumed that, in the course of previous conversation and argument
concerning these issues, the respondent has already placed himself/herself
in relation to the general population, and is able to indicate his/her
'position' immediately and simply.
It is easy to demonstrate. Ask a group to write 5,000-word essays on capital
punishment and have two judges to assess whether they are, on balance, 'for'
'uncertain', or 'against'. And ask the essay-writer also to complete the
catchphrase poll. The results are nearly identical, saving time and effort
in the lengthier approach. The former demands that the interviewee provide
instant appraisal of complex and authoritatively worded statements of
opinion: the latter is believed to tap immediate emotional reactions to
controversial issues and is closer to actual behaviour dispositions.
Furthermore, this technique overcomes many of the problems of grammatical
confusion and social desirability. Why not try it and see? I have
constructed a simple economic beliefs scale.
Which of the following do you favour or believe in? Circle Yes or No. If
absolutely uncertain, circle the question mark. There are no right or wrong
answers. Do not discuss them; just give your first reaction.
1 Nationalisation. YES NO ?
2 Self-sufficiency. YES NO ?
3 Socialism. YES NO ?
4 Free market. YES NO ?
5 Trade unions. YES NO ?
6 Saving. YES NO ?
7 Closed shops. YES NO ?
8 Monetarism. YES NO ?
9 Import controls. YES NO ?
10 Privatisation. YES NO ?
11 Strikes. YES NO ?
12 Informal black economy.
YES NO ?
13 Inheritance tax. YES NO ?
14 Insurance schemes.
YES NO ?
15 Council housing. YES NO ?
16 Private schools. YES NO ?
17 Child benefits. YES NO ?
18 Profit. YES NO ?
19 Wealth tax. YES NO ?
20 Public spending cuts.
YES NO ?
Scoring:
Odd items score Yes (3) ? (2) No (1)
Even items score Yes (1) ? (2) No (3)
Score 51 to 70 - you are what my father would call a 'dangerous pinko'.
Score 20 to 30 - you are what my students would call an 'economic fascist'.
Score 31 to 40 - you are probably a member of the entrepreneurial neo-right.
Score 41 to 50 - you are probably a supporter of the new post-Kinnock Labour
party.
Pedants, pollsters and politicians would probably object to this method. But
pundits and the public would welcome it because of its simplicity. Opinion
polling is not 'rocket-science', but it is a lot better than reading the
tea-leaves, or worse, horoscopes. They do have their uses and much of the
media are addicted to them. The catch-phrase method may indeed be superior
to and simpler than our more established methods.

FT  10 JUN 94 / Management: Fresh beginning beyond the Elbe - Judy Dempsey
examines the methods used by three companies investing in eastern Germany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'By the time the Americans, British and French arrived (in Berlin in July
1945), more than 90 per cent of Berlin's heavy industry had been spirited
away (to Russia). Ironically, this eventually worked in favour of west
Berlin's industries; when they came to start up again, they all had to be
re-equipped with modern, brand-new machinery.'
 -Berlin: The Biography of a City, by Anthony Read and David Fisher.
Nearly 50 years later, eastern Germany is going through a similar
experience. But, in place of the devastation of war, investors face an
uncompetitive and often obsolete, industrial base, whose markets were
dependent on eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.
The chemicals group BASF, the optical business Jenoptik, and the electronics
company Siemens have risen to this awesome management challenge.
All have been attracted by generous investment grants or subsidies from the
eastern German states, all have parent companies willing to invest in the
long term, and all found a skilled and adaptable work force in eastern
Germany. But, despite these similarities, the three companies have gone
about their investments in very different ways.
BASF bought a plant direct from the Treuhand privatisation agency, and is
investing DM1.3bn (Pounds 520m) in the enterprise at Schwarz-heide, in the
eastern state of Brandenburg. Jenoptik, once part of the Carl Zeiss optical
enterprise, and still under the state of Thuringia, has razed all the old
buildings at Jena in the south of the old east Germany and is starting
afresh with a DM3.6bn modernisation programme. Meanwhile, Siemens bought a
greenfield site last December and this week began work on its new plant,
part of what will ultimately be a DM2.7bn investment.
BASF's advantage was that the old Kombinat SYS chemicals plant was in
relatively good condition and had a sound infrastructure. 'It has direct
links to a natural gas network, so energy costs are low; it has an excellent
sewage plant - one of the few modern ones in the former GDR; and it is
located on the main motorway, less than one and a half hours from Berlin,'
says Hans-Hermann Dehmel, BASF's chairman in Schwarzheide.
BASF was also attracted by a looser regulatory climate and faster
decision-making structure than in the west of the country. Furthermore, it
acquired more capacity. 'It is very difficult to obtain this kind of space -
240ha - in western Germany, let alone acquiring the planning permission and
regulations,' Dehmel explained. The government of Brandenburg granted
planning permission within two months. 'It would normally have taken about
18 months in west Germany,' says Marc Vogel, BASF's spokesman at
Schwarzheide.
By early this year, BASF had already invested DM800m, of which DM200m was
spent installing several new production lines. These included a water-borne
coatings line, a non-solvent product spread over paint used primarily by the
car industry.
Nearly four years since acquiring Schwarzheide, Dehmel reflects on the
decision to invest in eastern Germany. 'I think productivity is still too
low,' he says. On some lines productivity is about 60 per cent of west
German levels, partly because of the recession, and also because BASF is
committed to employing 2,150 full-time staff, 300 apprentices and 1,000
subcontractors. Officials at the plant reckon they need just 2,150.
At Jena, before 1989, 30,000 people worked in the Carl Zeiss plant, which
had run up losses of more than DM1bn. Today, the Jenoptik workforce has been
cut to 1,250 employees after a programme of early retirement, redundancy
payments, and financial support for would-be small entrepreneurs.
In the past two years Uwe Reinert, a consultant from Hanover and now manager
of Jenoptik, has transformed the company from an outdated defence-based
enterprise to one based on four production lines. These include a
microfabrication division, providing high-performance equipment for
microsystems engineering and semiconductor fabrication; medical engineering;
environmental engineering; and automation engineering, which provides
optical equipment for quality control and inspection.
Reinert then set about providing self-contained and small micro-chip units
to companies that do not have their own chip production facilities.
Siemens, meanwhile, needed no introduction to eastern Germany. Since
unification, it has set up 11 production plants and service facilities,
employing more than 16,000 people throughout the five eastern states.
But it wanted production and research under one roof. Eastern Germany's
capacity and reservoir of skilled electronic engineers made it a suitable
location.
Last December the company announced its decision to invest DM2.4bn in
building a microchip factory in Dresden on a greenfield site. Scheduled to
be on line by 1996, it will manufacture 64-megabit and 256-megabit memory
chips.
Volkhart Matthaeus, finance director of Siemens' semiconductor group, says
there was a need to establish a core development centre in Germany itself.
'Through this operation in Dresden, we will be able to carry out joint
research projects (with other companies), some of which will be funded by
the German government,' he explains.
Siemens could have gone to eastern Europe, or south-east Asia, where labour
costs are cheaper. But Matthaeus says the company chose the eastern German
route for several reasons. 'In eastern Europe, you need investment partners,
regional funding, and an environment in which your partners are prepared to
invest with you. These conditions, at least for us, do not exist,' he
explains. That view is shared by BASF and Jenoptik.
As for south-east Asia, there are some logistical disadvantages. 'Any
product re-imported by us into the European Union incurs a 14 per cent tax.
That's a significant amount. Also, the computer industry costs money. You
can find cheaper labour in the region but you have to build an
infrastructure in a quality-minded environment,' he adds.

FT  10 JUN 94 / Property: A quiet revolution - One of the UK's richest
landlords is changing its approach
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The row over rent increases at Smithfield market in London has put the
spotlight on one of the country's richest landlords - the Corporation of
London.
The rumpus, which has arisen as a result of the need to meet the costs of
upgrading hygiene standards to European Union requirements, brings into the
public eye the corporation's eclectic property port-folio.
Its holdings, which date back to medieval times, embrace about a quarter of
the Square Mile in the City of London, along with extensive holdings in the
West End and other parts of the capital. For example, the corporation owns
New Bond Street, which was acquired in the 17th century as water-gathering
lands.
The pace of change in such a traditional and long-standing portfolio has,
inevitably, been slow. But, according to Mr Peter Bennett, the corporation's
deputy surveyor, the workings of the 500-year-old surveying department,
which oversees the corporation's portfolio, has undergone 'dramatic change'
over the past six years.
The corporation's independence and deep pockets have helped insulate it from
the ravages of the property collapse at the end of the 1980s. Nonetheless
the corporation has moved away from its traditional style of estate
management and adopted a tougher approach towards performance management.
'Over the past two years, we have been asking whether we are justified in
having this much property. We analysed our portfolio in 1990 when we looked
at every property and assessed its current and potential performance,' said
Mr Bennett.
Some properties were earmarked for sale because they were ill-suited to the
portfolio or would require too much management effort. So far the
corporation has sold about Pounds 10m of property. A few more properties are
expected to be sold this year. However, Mr Bennett added, 'We are not
flooding the market.'
The corporation's investment properties are divided into three portfolios:
the local authority portfolio, which is valued at between Pounds 150m and
Pounds 200m. Much of this portfolio comprises second world war bomb-damaged
property, principally around the London Wall area, which was bought
post-1945 for redevelopment.
Bridge House Estate, valued at between Pounds 150m and Pounds 200m. Revenue
from these properties, many of which were bequeathed during the Middle Ages,
are used to maintain City bridges: Tower, London, Southwark and Blackfriars.
The corporation is appealing to parliament to change its constitution; this
would enable the authority to use the fund for other purposes. A decision is
expected within the next few months.
City Estates, valued at between Pounds 300m and Pounds 400m. Revenues from
this fund are used to replenish the corporation's private purse, which
maintains Epping Forest, Hampstead Heath, the Port Health Authority,
quarantine facilities at Heathrow, Guildhall School of Music, Barbican
Centre and at Billingsgate and Smithfield markets.
In many cases, the corporation merely owns freeholds while buildings are
owned by leaseholders. In its City Estates portfolio, for instance,
buildings represent between just 10 per cent and 15 per cent of the
portfolio while the remainder is freehold.
The corporation's concentration on freehold rather than leasehold interests
has blunted the impact of recent market peaks and troughs on its portfolio.
'In a period of depression like the one we have been through, the effect of
vacancies has been very limited,' said Mr Bennett. After peaking at 10 per
cent, the corporation now said it had 'embarrassingly little' property to
offer prospective tenants.
The authority's ability to offer space at cheap rates has played a part in
its recent marketing campaign to reinforce London's role as Europe's leading
financial centre. It has been able to make space available in the City for
representative offices, such as the Polish Business Centre which is based at
the London Wall buildings.
As demand for City property starts to pick up, the corporation is also
dusting down its development programme. The programme tailed off during the
recession, although the corporation has recently completed a Pounds 12m
redevelopment of 1-7 Whittingdon Avenue and the rebuilding of Boston House
on the corner of New Broad Street and Old Broad Street. The corporation is
working on a Pounds 35m development of an art gallery in Guildhall Yard - a
complex scheme, adjacent to listed buildings and positioned over remains of
a Roman amphitheatre.
Schemes currently on the drawing board include a project in Tottenham Court
Road, where the corporation wants to build a 200,000 sq ft retail and office
complex on the site currently occupied by a set of empty warehouses. The
site has been owned by the corporation since 1574 when, as agricultural
land, it generated Pounds 4 a year in rental income.
The corporation is also considering developing two sites which it owns at
Ludgate Hill, totalling 247,000 sq ft. The scheme may be delayed, however,
because the proposed designs have not found favour with the Royal Fine Arts
Commission. Archaeological investigations, which are likely to reveal
important findings relating to the medieval City wall, are already under
way.
It is reluctant to expose itself to too much development risk. 'We will do
developments where there is an opportunity to make a good return and where
the size of the scheme is not too large. We do not want to over-expose
ourselves,' said Mr Bennett.
The authority prefers to find development partners as it did with the Little
Britain scheme in Aldersgate Street, which was developed with Wimpey
Property Holdings and Nippon Life; and at Alban Gate, which it developed in
partnership with MEPC Developments.
The corporation has put together a string of sites for which it wishes to
find either buyers or development partners - and it has marketed these at
exhibitions in Hong Kong and southern France.
The task of selling development sites in the City is not made easier by the
potential oversupply if developers acted on the large numbers of planning
permits that have already been granted. However, Mr Bennett said that there
is growing interest from developers. 'The key is to find the right product
in the right location,' he says.

Nearly 80 per cent of UK exporters consider their order book to be good or

insurance group. About 89 per cent of those surveyed said the number of
their export customers increased over the last quarter.
Asia and North America were considered the most buoyant markets by
exporters. Only 22 per cent of those polled considered European Union
markets to be buoyant, and Italy was the country that was perceived as being
the greatest risk over the next 12 months.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A truck driver who admitted six charges of cross-Channel bootlegging was
yesterday jailed for 150 days.
Portsmouth magistrates heard that Mr Peter Roberts, of Melyn, West
Glamorgan, had brought in 'a very large quantity' of wine, spirits, beer,
tobacco and cigarettes by ferry on a number of occasions.
He was caught at Portsmouth ferry terminal after an operation by Customs
officers from the city and Southampton.
Mr Roberts' activities were said to have cheated Customs out of more than
Pounds 10,000. He sold the goods in the UK and used Pounds 7,000 from the
proceeds to renovate his house.

FT  10 JUN 94 / Dairy Crest to shed 600 jobs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Dairy Crest, the milk processing and dairy products arm of the Milk
Marketing Board, plans to cut 12.5 per cent of its workforce - 600 jobs - by
the end of the year in response to increasingly competitive market
conditions.
The company said some of the job losses would involve compulsory
redundancies. Most of the jobs lost will be from layers of management which
Dairy Crest said had become too bureaucratic under the culture of the Milk
Marketing Board.
The company said the job cuts were part of its rationalisation plans to get
the business into shape for a planned stock market flotation, possibly in
November. Dairy Crest is being spun off from the milk board when Britain's
Pounds 3.3bn milk market is liberalised on November 1.
In the run-up to deregulation, increased competition and supermarket price
wars have put pressure on dairy companies' profit margins.
Mr John Houliston, Dairy Crest chief executive, said: 'We are operating in
an extremely competitive market which shows no sign of getting any easier.
'We must ensure we can compete in the prevailing demanding conditions.'

FT  10 JUN 94 / Leadership Contest: Cunningham pulls out and backs Blair
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jack Cunningham yesterday withdrew from Labour's leadership battle and
threw his weight behind Mr Tony Blair, virtually guaranteeing a
three-cornered fight when the contest begins today.
Mr Blair, shadow home secretary and the party's leading moderniser, is the
hot favourite to succeed John Smith. He will be joined on the hustings by
Mrs Margaret Beckett, the acting leader, and Mr John Prescott, the
traditionalist shadow employment secretary.
Mrs Beckett will also stand for re-election as deputy leader, the post she
has held since 1992. Mr Prescott will decide at a 9am meeting with close
friends whether he should also contest the deputy's post.
The only remaining uncertainty surrounds the position of Mr Robin Cook,
shadow trade and industry secretary, who is likely to decide against running
for either post. Mr Cook is expected to throw his weight behind Mr Blair.
Mr Blair will formally declare his candidacy at a constituency meeting in
Sedgefield on Saturday. He is regarded as certain to win, following the
withdrawal last week of Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor.
Mr Cunningham, shadow foreign secretary, was regarded as a rank outsider. He
said he had received 'a large amount of encouragement and support', but it
was in Labour's interests for Mr Blair to win. 'I would urge all those who
offered me their support to vote for him, and I shall do everything I can to
ensure his success,' he said.
The extreme left is unlikely to nominate a candidate because of divisions
within the Campaign group, the main leftwing forum. However, Mr Ken
Livingstone, who made an unsuccessful attempt to win the leadership in 1992,
signalled that the left will seek to limit Mr Blair's room for manoeuvre. In
a letter to Mr Blair, Mr Livingstone demanded a clear commitment to full
employment, and claimed there was 'widespread dissatisfaction with the
cautious and orthodox economic approach' of Mr Brown.
'You may feel that this letter is an attempt to pin you down,' Mr
Livingstone wrote to Mr Blair. 'That is correct. No politician has the right
to ask the Labour party or the British people for a blank cheque. Those who
seek to govern must go beyond sound-bites and photo-opportunities.'
Mr Blair's friends have welcomed the prospect of a contest which they
believe will allow him to lay the groundwork for a successful campaign to
win the next general election.
Officials believe that the party's high opinion poll standing is due in part
to media coverage of the phoney leadership campaign over the past few weeks.
Mr Prescott will focus his campaign on the strength of Labour's commitment
to full employment, combined with the promise of a return to traditional
socialist values.
Mrs Beckett, who has moved substantially to the right as deputy leader, will
cover some of the same ground. She will also present herself as the
candidate offering the best organisational ability and continuity with Mr
Smith's leadership.

FT  10 JUN 94 / Campaign Diary: Unknown political leader ready for top Euro
job
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European election campaign has thrown up a surprise challenger to
Virginia Bottomley and Margaret Beckett for the unofficial title of
Britain's most powerful female politician. Beckett's claim will strengthen
if she declares today that she is a candidate to succeed John Smith
permanently. But even if she defeats Tony Blair, the red-hot favourite, she
will still be in opposition. Not so Pauline Green, the former policewoman
who leads Labour's Euro MPs. As leader of the largest delegation in the
European parliament, Green already wields great influence in Europe. But she
is also favourite to become leader of all the socialist MEPs in the new
parliament - almost certain to be the largest political group. That would
make her the single most important European parliamentarian, with massive
influence over legislation. Green says she has no interest in moving to
Westminster. But she is already a member of Labour's national executive
committee. Beckett should watch out.
* * *
John Major is developing some decidedly Thatcherite ways of dealing with the
awkward squad. Interviewed on LBC radio about Lord Tebbit's Euro-phobic
views, the prime minister twice referred to the former Conservative party
chairman as Mr Tebbit - which is a bit strange considering that it was Major
who asked the Queen to raise Tebbit to the peerage in 1992. Downing Street
said it was a slip of the tongue. But those with long memories may remember
that Baroness Thatcher - then plain Mrs - once inflicted similar humiliation
on Sir Robin Day by repeatedly 'mistering' him during a long television
interview. She, too, said it was a slip of the tongue.
* * *
Shadow chancellor Gordon Brown was forced to think on his feet on Tuesday
morning when his notes for a press conference speech on the OECD jobs report
failed to arrive in time at the TGWU's Transport House headquarters.
Campaign chairman Jack Cunningham helped out by calling Margaret Beckett and
John Prescott to speak first, but with dozens of anxious hacks straining at
the leash, Brown had to deliver his remarks off the cuff. The disappearing
notes turned up near the end of the press conference - ferried by an
embarrassed aide. He had been stuck for 25 minutes in the security doors
outside Brown's Millbank office. No-one noticed Brown's difficulty, which
suggests that either he thinks extremely quickly, or he usually ignores his
notes anyway.
* * *
Lord Sutch's Monster Raving Loony party has plenty of rivals in the
Euro-election for the title of Britain's wackiest party. Apart from three
other Loony parties, the 79 parties contesting the election include the
Eurobean from the Planet Beanus party, the Boston Tea party, the Rainbow
Connection Oui-Say-Non party, and the Make Criminals Concerned About Our
Response To Hostility and Yobbishness party. The Campaign Diary prize goes
to the 21st Century party, based in a market in Rickmansworth, which bases
its manifesto on the lyrics to songs by Pink Floyd, the pretentious rock
group. The party, which has candidates in NW London and Hertfordshire, says
it wants to make politics less boring. But not, unfortunately, less noisy.
* * *
Wondering where the beards and sandals went when the Liberals and the Social
Democrats merged? Look no further than the Liberal party - formed (or
continued) by a handful of enthusiasts when the others set up the Liberal
Democrats. The Liberals, fighting 19 Euro-seats, are not quite a spent
force: they have 60 councillors across the country and are the biggest group
in Warminster, the Wiltshire town renowned for UFO sightings. The party's
platform is splendidly unconventional: they oppose Maastricht but support
common European citizenship and a 'democratically constituted' world
government in which 'all disputes will be resolved by ballots and legal
processes'. What a good idea.
* * *
Jack Straw, Labour's larrikin campaign organiser, has asked the police to
investigate the alleged misuse of opinion poll figures by Liberal Democrats
in Suffolk, claiming that an offence has been committed under the
Representation of the People Act. (The Lib Dems say it was a mistake).
Labour has been more careful in neighbouring Essex North and Suffolk South,
where an article headed Labour - Leading the Way, says of the local
elections: 'In Colchester, Labour gained Tiptree, and now runs neck and neck
with the Tories in the borough.' Well, sort of. Actually, Labour took 24.4
per cent of the vote in May, just behind the Tories on 25.8 per cent. But
the Liberal Democrats won 47.5 per cent - nearly double the other two
parties put together. Sounds like an offence under the Mis-Representation of
the People Act.
* * *
The Islamic Party of Great Britain seems to be rather less of a threat to
the established parties than once seemed likely. General secretary Sahib
Mustaquim Beleher says the party wanted to put up European election
candidates in the main Moslem areas of Yorkshire, Lancashire and London, but
had to drop out to conserve its resources for the by-election in Bradford
South, where it won 0.3 per cent of the vote in the 1992 general election.
But it was unable to run a candidate there either. So far, the party's best
performance was 4.8 per cent of the vote in a Rotherham local election.
* * *
Peter Lilley, the deeply Euro-sceptic social security secretary, seems to be
developing a penchant for things French. First, he spends most of the
campaign at his Normandy holiday home, then he rushes back to speak in
Huddersfield for Christine Adamson, the only French candidate standing in
Britain. It's not clear why Lilley chose Yorkshire South West for his
reappearance - the rock-solid Labour seat is hardly at the centre of
national attention. Surely he was not trying to avoid the media? He has
still not appeared on the platform at Conservative Central Office during the
campaign, allegedly because social security is outside the competence of the
EU. But pro-European Tories are not buying that one. They say Virginia
Bottomley has appeared, although health is also outside the EU's scope.

FT  10 JUN 94 / Tory bastion looking vulnerable: Roland Adburgham hears much
anti-government sentiment in the Devon and East Plymouth seat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'I'm sick and tired of this government and so are a lot of people,' said Mr
Paul Murray, leaving a polling station yesterday in the market town of
Cullompton in Devon. 'It's no longer a caring government. I've voted Tory
before but I'm determined to get them out.'
Cullompton is in the European constituency of Devon and East Plymouth, which
should be a Tory bastion. The Conservatives had a majority of 57,000 at the
last election in 1989 with nearly 50 per cent of the vote. But it is now a
seat which the party will be highly relieved to hold against the Liberal
Democrat challenge.
Polls show that while the seat is not the easiest for the Liberal Democrats
to win, it is within their grasp.
All the parties agreed yesterday, however, that the result was uncertain. Mr
Tony Kirk, the said Labour agent, said: 'It is extremely open - anyone could
win it.' The turnout was seen as crucial. In the 1989 election it was 40 per
cent and at the polling stations yesterday, in spite of the sunshine, there
was little indication it would be higher. One official said: 'It's only
so-so.'
Mr Julian Walden, the Conservative agent, said: 'Apathy will win the day.
But we've never worked as hard to maximise our vote.' The Tory MEP was Lord
O'Hagan, but he stood down and was replaced by Mr Giles Chichester, a map
publisher and son of Sir Francis Chichester, the yachtsman.
Mr Walden said: 'He is a character, and Devon likes characters.'
But the rival parties say that, on the doorstep, the striking factor was the
number of disaffected Tory voters.
Mr Paul Edwards, the Green party candidate, said: 'The overwhelming
impression is there are many Tories determined to send a message to the
government by voting against it.' In 1989 his party came second to the
Tories in the constituency, with almost a quarter of the vote. Mr Edwards
was reconciled to a lower vote this time.
Much of the green vote is assumed to have gone to the Liberal Democrats, who
in 1989 won only 10 per cent of the vote, trailing Labour which had 18 per
cent. The Liberal Democrats are riding high after winning effective control
of Devon county council last year but the party accepts victory is by no
means certain.
One reason has been a local difficulty. Its candidate, Mr Adrian Sanders,
faced opposition from a Liberal candidate and a Literal Democrat candidate.
Mr Nick Rijke, the campaign manager, reported an 'enormous' number of calls
to the campaign headquarters in Crediton from confused voters yesterday. By
early evening he felt more confident: 'The indications are looking good.'
The main issues raised on the doorstep, he said, had been high water charges
in the south-west, health, and rising crime in the county. European issues
had featured on specific matters such as the transport of live animals.
'People vote on a feel-good factor,' he said. 'But people have a feel-bad
factor about the government.'
Out in the lush Devon countryside his party won the poster battle. The
Tories complained that some of their posters were torn down. This, and a
failed legal attempt by the Liberal Democrats to block the Literal Democrat
candidate, have been the main excitements in a campaign subdued, as
elsewhere, by the death of John Smith, the Labour leader.
Labour believes it has a genuine chance in the constituency, helped by
boundary changes which have included east Plymouth and excluded north Devon.
Mr Kirk said: 'We've had a tremendous response on the doorstep - it's
surprised even us.' Ms Linda Gilroy, the party's candidate, said: 'I started
by thinking that it was a seat where we had no chance, but after the last
three weeks anything is possible.'
At the Tory campaign headquarters in Exeter Mr Walden agreed Labour had
fought an active campaign. While reconciled to losing some votes, he said:
'People have begun to focus more and more on European issues. Our supporters
who drifted away from us have started to drift back. The longer the campaign
has gone on, the better it has been for us.'
Mr Walden was optimistic that people would vote for the candidate who would
best represent their views in the European parliament, rather than using the
election as a referendum on the government.
He said: 'There is a general feeling that the Tories have been in power for
15 years and some people would like a change.' Yet, he believed, 'having
been behind in the opinion polls, it now seems to be swinging back to us at
the eleventh hour'.
His confidence was perhaps misplaced. A woman chaining up her bicycle at an
Exeter polling station, said when asked how would she vote: 'Certainly not
for the Tories.'

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tony Blair had the grace to look a bit embarrassed about some of the anodyne
written questions read out to him by acolytes at an election rally in
Eastleigh - after all, the odds on getting through a question-and-answer
session without a hostile question, much less a barbed remark about the
leadership, must be astronomical. So were the questions vetted? Or are the
voters afraid to upset Bambi? Whatever, Blair can expect a rougher ride when
the leadership contest starts in earnest today.
* * *
A straw in the wind? With an eye on Eastleigh's British Rail maintenance
works, transport secretary John MacGregor managed to hold a by-election
press conference in the constituency without mentioning privatisation once.
Asked whether his references to 'rail reforms' were a cover for the P-word,
a defensive MacGregor said the railway sell-off was not a privatisation in
the classic sense. So much for privatisation. There was a time when
ministers would talk about little else.

the grounds that such a move would lead to more addiction.
The home secretary told top police officers that the maintenance of
international solidarity against drug misuse was vital.
He also ruled out the de-criminalisation of drugs. To decide not to enforce
certain laws while leaving them on the statute book risked bringing 'the
whole of the criminal law into disrepute'.
His remarks to the Association of Chief Police Officers drugs conference in
Wakefield came a day after both Mr Raymond Kendall, secretary-general of
Interpol, and Mr Keith Hellawell, chief constable of West Yorkshire police,
backed decriminalisation as a means of tackling the drug problem.
Mr Howard said: 'This government has no intention of legalising any
currently banned drug. To do so would be bound to increase the human and
social damage, especially that inflicted on the young.'
Signalling a possible new clampdown on drug dealers at street level, Mr
Howard said enforcement activity was most effective when immediately
followed by 'environmental changes'.
These might include the wholesale demolition of drug-dealing areas, as well
as improving street lighting and traffic management.
Mr Howard said that the Metropolitan Police's crackdown on drug dealing and
prostitution in the King's Cross area of north London in 1992 was one
example of where a co-ordinated approach had had a significant impact.
But he said enforcement and other 'supply-side measures' would never alone
solve the drugs problem.
Welcoming the introduction of drugs education into the national curriculum,
he said the government should help young people and other high-risk groups
to resist becoming involved with drugs.

FT  10 JUN 94 / CBI chief warns on wage inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the strongest warnings about the potential danger to economic
recovery from wage inflation was delivered yesterday by Sir Bryan Nicholson,
president of the Confederation of British Industry, Lisa Wood writes.
In a speech to the west Midlands region of the CBI, Sir Bryan said: 'We have
a bleak history of making competitive gains and then throwing them away
needlessly. I am determined that this time we shall not snatch defeat from
the jaws of victory.'
Sir Bryan highlighted sustainable non-inflationary growth as one of the
three main priorities during his two-year term. Others were improving the
overall competitiveness of industry and the creation of a deregulated
business-friendly Europe. He singled out the City as needing particular
restraint over inflationary pay arrangements.
Recent labour-market statistics had disturbed his peace of mind, he said.
'Thanks to growth in average earnings in manufacturing of 4.75 per cent over
the year to March and slower productivity growth of just 2.6 per cent, unit
labour costs in manufacturing are increasing again at 2 per cent a year.
'That would have been a very respectable performance just a few years ago.
But our competitors have regrouped and are achieving better results which we
must match. Unit labour costs are now falling by 2 per cent a year in
Germany and 3 per cent in the US.' Pay restraint in the public sector was
one important component of an anti-inflationary strategy, he said. But
private-sector employers needed to pay close attention to controlling the
whole pay package, including bonuses, allowances and overtime.
'It is only too easy for earnings drift to occur without it being properly
controlled, or even noticed, before it is too late,' he said.

FT  10 JUN 94 / Staff bodies to meet for anti-performance pay campaign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two of the most powerful staff representative bodies in the health service
will meet next week to discuss a joint campaign against the introduction of
performance pay, the annual consultants' conference of the British Medical
Association was told yesterday, John Willman writes.
Mr John Chawner, chairman of the BMA senior hospital doctors committee, said
the government's plans to introduce performance pay were dangerous.
Leaders of the BMA, which represents 80,000 doctors and surgeons, will join
leaders of the 300,000-strong Royal College of Nursing in opposing the
plans.
Mr Chawner warned that allowing trusts to determine performance pay would
end national salary scales because some would not be able to afford the cost
of bonuses.

FT  10 JUN 94 / Receiver loses insolvency licence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The former receiver to Chelsea Football &amp; Athletic Club, the liquidated
company now subject to an Official Receivers' inquiry, has had his
insolvency licence withdrawn.
Mr John Papi, a London-based practitioner, has been asked by the Insolvency
Practitioners' Association, the regulatory body, to return his licence
following a disciplinary hearing concluded last month.
Mr Malcolm London, a partner with Coopers &amp; Lybrand and president of the
association, confirmed yesterday that he had written requesting Mr Papi's
licence and asking him to reassign all his existing work to other
practitioners. After an investigation lasting several months, the
association ruled early last month that Mr Papi should be prevented from
acting as an insolvency practitioner and ordered him to pay Pounds 8,000.
Mr Papi, who was under investigation on a series of alleged regulatory
breaches, had one month to appeal. This period has lapsed.
It also emerged yesterday that he faces a bankruptcy petition for several
thousand pounds in the name of Manches, a firm of solicitors. A hearing in
the High Court is scheduled for June 28.
The Insolvency Practitioners' Association and a number of other creditors
are also pursuing Mr Papi for outstanding sums. Mr Keith Goodman, a partner
at accountants Leonard Curtis, who is receiver to Frank Dale &amp; Stepsons, a
franchiser of Rolls-Royces and Bentleys, confirmed that he was seeking
Pounds 15,000 from Mr Papi for unpaid servicing bills on several cars.
Mr Papi, who was unavailable for comment yesterday, previously had his
licence suspended on disciplinary grounds for six months in 1990.

FT  10 JUN 94 / NHS 'grey suits' seek brighter image: The idea of
professional health managers has gained ground slowly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Any delegate who attends this week's conference of the Institute of Health
Services Management wearing a grey suit will be suspected of an act of
defiance.
The grey-suits jibe was started by Mr John Redwood, Welsh secretary, in
November when he spoke of a 'restlessness among medical staff about the
number of men in grey suits'. It has since become an everyday expression,
tinged with insult, throughout the service.
The 1990s have not been an easy time for National Health Service managers.
They have carried responsibility for introducing the biggest ever changes in
the way the service is run, only to be rewarded, many feel, by increasingly
bitter and personal attacks from politicians, doctors and the public.
Although the health service is one of the largest organisations in the
world, the notion that it needs to be managed professionally has gained
ground only slowly. It is less than 10 years since the first business-style
general managers began reshaping a committee-dominated administrative
system. The 1991 reforms increased the importance and status of managers -
but also brought criticism that money was being diverted to management from
clinical services.
Mr Alan Langlands, who today addresses institute delegates for the first
time since becoming NHS chief executive, says he recognises that some of his
colleagues feel 'a bit bruised' by the style of the recent public debate
about managers.
'The fact that the health service needs good managers should no longer be in
doubt,' he says. 'We need people capable of managing in the complex
environment of changing social standards, demographic change, technological
advance, resource constraints and a climate of intense public and political
interest. But we must act responsibly and show that we are aware of public
concern about management costs.'
Mr Langlands says information he has gathered on authorities purchasing
healthcare on behalf of populations of 500,000 people show typical
management costs of Pounds 5 per head of population - compared with spending
of Pounds 660 per head on services.
Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, yesterday warned the
conference that there were 'unacceptably wide' variations in management
costs between trusts, ranging from almost 4 per cent to 8.6 per cent of the
total pay bill. High administrative costs did not help managers, who were
already suffering an image problem and were regarded with scepticism by the
public, she said.
Forthcoming changes in health service structure are likely to bring
reductions in managerial and administrative costs. Ministers are considering
reports on the role of the health department's central administration and of
the Leeds-based NHS executive now that the 1991 reforms have pushed
day-to-day activity to local level.
Mr Langlands expects 'substantial staff cost savings' from moves to
amalgamate district health authorities, which purchase hospital care, and
the family health service authorities responsible for primary services.
Raising the average standard of middle managers is among Mr Langlands's
priorities. The reforms have increased demand for specialist staff in areas
such as finance and personnel.
At the same time, the number of career health service managers being
recruited by other organisations is growing - evidence that NHS managers are
appreciated somewhere, if not always in the service itself.

FT  10 JUN 94 / Cruise industry charts mass-market course
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The cruise industry, a traditional preserve of the rich and retired,
yesterday declared itself open to the mass market when P&amp;O Cruises cut its
1995 prices - in some cases to below their 1989 levels.
Next Wednesday, Airtours, the determinedly mass-market package tour
operator, announces plans for its first cruise ship which will begin sailing
in 1995. Airtours yesterday pledged to 'revolutionise the market' when it
unveils its prices.
Mr Hugh Collinson, Airtours managing director, said: 'You've seen nothing
yet. This is a different end of the market to where cruising has been
before.'
P&amp;O says the UK cruise market is growing at twice the rate of the overall
foreign holiday market. Mr David Dingle, P&amp;O Cruises marketing director,
forecasts the number of UK cruise customers will grow from the current
figure of 250,000 a year to 700,000 by the year 2000.
P&amp;O's price reductions have been made possible by the planned launch next
April of Oriana, its new Pounds 200m cruise liner, which is being built in
Germany. The introduction of the Oriana, which will carry nearly 2,000
passengers, will allow P&amp;O to offer cheaper cruises on its older ships, the
Canberra and the Sea Princess.
The Canberra will offer nine-day cruises next year from Pounds 575 - Pounds
10 cheaper than in 1989. A 12-day Mediterranean cruise for two adults and
two teenage children will cost Pounds 2,877, which is Pounds 640 cheaper
than this year.
Airtours announced last April that it was buying a 752-berth ship from
Closter Cruise of Norway for Pounds 16m, including refurbishment costs. The
ship will offer Mediterranean and Canary Island cruises.
Mr Dingle said P&amp;O's price reductions were planned before Airtours announced
its ship purchase. He said P&amp;O welcomed Airtours' cruising debut. He said:
'What Airtours are good at is talking to a slightly younger, more
down-market group of customers. They will put cruising in people's minds.'
But Mr Dingle added: 'It is important that the image that they portray does
not, how should we say it, reduce the glamour factor in cruising.'
Mr Collinson said: 'I don't think we should confuse the new cruise market
with a poor, down-beat product.'
The cruise industry says the traditional view of cruising as being
overpriced and for the elderly is already out-of-date. But Mr Peter Shanks,
commercial director of Thomas Cook, which claims to be the UK's biggest
cruise retailer, said he had customers who had been booking the same cabin
on the Canberra for 25 years.
Mr Shanks said, however, that the market had enormous scope for growth.
Cruises represent only 2.7 per cent of overseas holidays from the UK. In the
US the figure is 60 per cent.

FT  10 JUN 94 / Doctors to fight performance pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two of the most powerful staff representative bodies in the health service
will meet next week to discuss a joint campaign against the introduction of
performance pay, the annual consultants' conference of the British Medical
Association was told yesterday.
Mr John Chawner, chairman of the BMA senior hospital doctors committee, said
the government's plans to introduce performance pay were 'so dangerous that
it is our duty to strongly resist them'.
Leaders of the BMA, which represents 80,000 doctors and surgeons, will join
leaders of the 300,000-strong Royal College of Nursing in opposing the
plans.
Mr Chawner said that there was mounting evidence that performance related
pay demotivated staff and disadvantaged women and ethnic minorities.
Simplistic incentive schemes would reward quantity rather than quality,
encouraging doctors to rush their work and neglect counselling, he said.
Mr Chawner also warned that allowing trusts to determine performance pay
would end national salary scales, since some would not be able to afford the
cost of bonuses.
This would undermine the work of the health service pay review bodies, which
would not know what doctors were earning. Nurses had as much to lose as
doctors, he added.
'They remember pay bargaining and the turmoil it caused to their profession
and the health service,' he said. 'This is why this government gave them
their own review body which is now threatened by the same government.'
However, the conference narrowly defeated a move to encourage consultants to
resign from the health service and offer freelance services.

FT  10 JUN 94 / Revenue rapped over false tax assessments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Half a million taxpayers received incorrect assessments because of Inland
Revenue errors last year, says a highly critical National Audit Office
report released today.
Ten per cent of the self-employed and 7 per cent of those who pay tax using
the PAYE system were the victims of Inland Revenue miscalculations, the
findings show.
The report from the audit office, the Whitehall watchdog, also highlights
the fact that the Revenue was failing to meet its own published targets to
reply to taxpayers' queries within 28 days.
The findings will embarrass the Inland Revenue, which conducted a survey two
years ago showing that taxpayers chiefly wanted the department to get their
tax right first time and respond quickly to queries.
The report will form the basis of questions for Sir Anthony Battishill,
chairman of the Board of Inland Revenue, when he appears before the Commons
public accounts committee at the end of this month.
It shows that about 3.2m of the 5m taxpayers who receive assessments have
the demand revised downwards at least once each year. Most miscalculations
are the result of failures on the part of taxpayers, but the NAO says 10 per
cent of these 5m have their assessments revised because of Inland Revenue
errors. In three-fifths of those cases, the cause is a failure by inspectors
to allow the correct allowances and reliefs. The report notes that the
errors are as likely to be discovered by taxpayers or their advisers as by
Revenue staff.
The NAO is critical of the Revenue's definition of 'substantive replies',
which it has pledged to provide to taxpayers within 28 days. About half of
the most complex tax queries took longer than a month to resolve.
The delays were caused partly by communications between Revenue offices. Of
the 140m items of post received by Revenue offices each year, only 55m come
from taxpayers. The remaining 85m are correspondence passing between the
offices.
The Revenue admitted that the number of incorrect assessments identified in
the report was 'unacceptable' and said it was planning to publish new
quality targets.
However, it emphasised that the faulty assessments related only to 'the top
20 per cent of taxpayers who have the most complicated affairs', and not the
vast majority who are taxed on the PAYE system. It said criticism of the
time taken to reply to letters was based on an analysis of the most
difficult 5 per cent of queries.
'We are hoping to improve all the time,' said the Revenue.

FT  10 JUN 94 / Canary Wharf winning converts: Vanessa Houlder on the battle
for the hearts and minds of the tenants needed to fill the gaps
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The opening of a new wine bar is a significant event in Canary Wharf's
struggle for the hearts and minds of tenants, following the east London
development's traumatic insolvency two years ago.
Last month's arrival of a Corney &amp; Barrow branch - a modernistic wine bar
that sports stock-market prices on wall-mounted television screens, clocks
on its ceiling and direct phone links to brokers - has helped counter
complaints about the lifelessness of the development.
The busy bar helped give Canary Wharf 'a City atmosphere', said a bank
employee. 'Life seemed to imitate an architect's drawing,' said an
advertising executive. 'The bar seemed to give a lift to the place.'
Corney &amp; Barrow is one of a number of new tenants which rejected the idea of
moving into the scheme in its early days but have decided to take the plunge
following the project's emergence from administration and the increase in
the number of its tenants. Eight retailers - mainly clothes shops - are due
to open by September and Canary Wharf hopes to achieve its target of
doubling the number of retail operations there to 40 this year.
It is in talks with 'more than one' food retailer to fill the gap which
Marks and Spencer recently decided not to fill. One of the reasons given by
Marks and Spencer for its change of mind was the fact that its emphasis on
fresh food was unsuitable for office workers lacking access to
refrigerators.
The attraction for potential retailers is the captive market of affluent
office workers, 30 per cent of whom earn more than Pounds 35,000. 'There are
quite a lot of youngish people earning good salaries,' said Mr Colin Evans,
chief executive of Austin Reed, the fashion group, which opens in August. By
autumn there will be about 12,000 people working at Canary Wharf.
Sir Peter Levene, chairman and chief executive of Canary Wharf, who was on a
marketing tour of the US this week, claims to be more flexible in his
approach to wooing tenants than Olympia &amp; York, the scheme's original
developers.
'We are being more responsive to what tenants want. It is not just take it
or leave it. I don't have the hang-up that O&amp;Y had that 'unless you have
your head office here, we don't want you'. We are happy to have back
offices.'
Sir Peter says one of the most important tasks is persuading potential
tenants to visit the development. 'You would be astonished by the number of
people who have not visited it. Everyone who comes down there goes away
converted.'
On the ground, not everybody is so sure. Tenants complain of 'feeling
marooned' and of having 'nowhere to take clients'. Travel times to work and
to meetings in the West End of London are also the source of frequent
complaints.
Nevertheless, there is a general feeling that life at Canary Wharf is
improving. The completion of the Limehouse link has speeded car journeys
from the City and by the end of the year the Docklands Light Railway will
increase its capacity to 6,000 people an hour and will start running at
weekends.
Confidence in the project is also helped by the establishment of the scheme
on a sound financial footing, after a consortium of 11 banks took it out of
administration last autumn. The banks have deferred repayment of Pounds 558m
of loans and interest until the year 2007 and put in an additional Pounds
278m of facilities.
Sir Peter talks boldly about filling Canary Wharf within four years. Doing
so is unlikely to be easy. Canary Wharf is in competition not just with the
City and West End, but with other schemes in Docklands, where another 2m sq
ft of modern space is available, at considerably cheaper rents than Canary
Wharf which is offering space at between Pounds 15 and Pounds 25 a square
foot.
Lettings in the Docklands area have increased recently. Over the past year,
a total of 800,000 sq ft has been taken up, more than double the level in
the previous 12 months, according to Knight Frank &amp; Rutley, chartered
surveyors.
There are some other signs of increased confidence, such as McDonalds'
application for permission to open a drive-through hamburger restaurant on
the Isle of Dogs.
However, five out of six of the largest office deals were to provide
disaster-recovery facilities for financial institutions, such as Citibank
and SG Warburg. These offices would only be used in the event of a
disruption, such as last year's Bishopsgate bombing, enforcing a transfer of
operations, and will do little to stimulate economic growth of the area.
Knight Frank &amp; Rutley predicts an oversupply of space in Docklands for at
least three more years.
Unsurprisingly, there is no interest in building any more offices in the
area - although the London Docklands Development Corporation is examining
proposals for an exhibition centre and a 70-acre 'urban village' in the
Royal Docks.
Canary Wharf believes further development has merely been postponed. Sir
Peter says that once the existing space is let, it will look seriously at
the prospect of starting work on the next phase of office space.

FT  10 JUN 94 / Racism ruling 'upsets' workers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Workers at the Midlands foundry at which some were judged by an industrial
tribunal this week to have racially abused an Irishman have protested to
management about 'misrepresentation' of their views by the media.
'They are upset at being accused of being racist; the fact is 95 per cent of
the workers did not know who the man was,' said Mr Kevin Else, acting
convenor at Auto Alloys Foundry at Blackwell, Derbyshire.
'The workers are complaining that they have not been allowed the right to
reply to the allegations.'
Mr Trevor McAuley, a 36-year-old machinist from Northern Ireland, won nearly
Pounds 6,000 from the tribunal after it found unanimously that he had
suffered at work from persistent anti-Irish abuse which had undermined his
health by causing him stress.
Mr Tony McCarthy, general secretary of the TUC-affiliated National Union of
Domestic Appliances and General Operatives, whose members work at the
foundry, said he could 'not understand the judgment'.
He added that the union's members at the foundry where Mr McAuley worked for
two years were 'upset and mystified' by what had happened at the industrial
tribunal.
Mr McCarthy said he had been called in to investigate the allegation of
racial abuse against Mr McAuley, and he visited the foundry three times to
interview all the workers individually to find out what was going on.
'I could find not a shred of evidence to support Trevor's allegations,' said
Mr McCarthy. 'Most of the workers said they did not even know him, let alone
abuse him. He worked by himself with an apprentice in a separate part of the
foundry.'
He added: 'I sent a statement explaining this to the industrial tribunal,
but they did not refer to it or ask me to give evidence.
'None of the workers at the foundry were called before the two-day hearing.
This kind of case gives industrial tribunals a bad name.'
Mr Dan Taylor, the company's managing director, re-ffirmed he could not
afford to appeal against the decision.
The Commission for Racial Equality, which sponsored Mr McAuley's action,
said last night that it would be approaching the company to urge it to
introduce anti-discriminatory policies in its workplace to prevent any
further abuse of Irish-born workers.
'We don't pursue cases vindictively against any individual, but to achieve
equal opportunities,' said the commission. It believes the McAuley case will
help to bring about a change of approach among employers about workplace
attitudes to people from Ireland.

FT  10 JUN 94 / Stallholders unite to fight a free market: Neil Buckley on
ministers' moves to deregulate 'come hell or high water'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dave Stevens first started working on a flower stall in East Street market,
off the Old Kent Road in south-east London, when his mother ran it 30 years
ago. Now he wonders how much longer he can make a living from it.
Hit by recession and by competition from supermarkets and shopping centres,
many traditional street markets have seen their fortunes decline. Now, says
Mr Stevens, they face another threat.
'Car-boot sales have become huge illegal markets,' he said. 'People are
bringing vans and lorries, and they're selling a lot of dodgy stuff. The
trouble is, if the government had their way, it would be like India,
everyone trying to sell something on every street.'
He is referring to the government's attempts through the deregulation and
contracting-out bill - which received its second reading in the House of
Lords on Monday - to abolish the centuries-old rights of many local
authorities to control market trading. Traders and councils say this would
lead to an explosion of new markets, many engaged in illegal trade.
The government, faced last month with a rebellion by backbench MPs, was
forced to remove clauses designed to abolish so-called market-franchise
rights. But the issue has not gone away.
Mr Tim Sainsbury, industry minister, told the Commons the government would
consult further, and bring forward amended clauses on markets during the
bill's passage through the Lords.
The Department of the Environment confirmed this week that this was still
its intention - in spite of appeals from opponents not to 'rush through'
potentially incomplete and inadequate legislation.
'The government has got this policy to deregulate, but as far as markets are
concerned it seems to be deregulate come hell or high water,' said Mr Brian
Ormshaw, secretary of the National Association of British Market
Authorities, a group of 135 local authorities.
'Nobody wants red tape and bureaucracy, but it is clear that some activities
need to be controlled.'
Charters and statutes giving councils the right to hold a market in their
town, while restricting the operation of other markets, date to the 12th
century. Some 250 councils have market-franchise rights, and together
receive about Pounds 110m a year in gross rents.
No other markets can be held without local authority permission within a 6
2/3 -mile radius of a charter market - considered in medieval times to be
the maximum distance a trader with horse and cart could travel out and back
in a day to conduct trade.
The government says the rules are anachronistic and are misused by some
councils to stifle business initiatives.
Opponents agree the system is outdated, but argue abolition is not the way
to deal with it.
The association has formed an umbrella group, the Campaign for Quality
Markets, to oppose the government's original plans. Eight other bodies are
members, including the National Market Traders' Federation; the Association
of British Chambers of Commerce; the Federation of Small Businesses; the
Association of District Councils and the Association of Metropolitan
Authorities.
The campaign says abolishing market-franchise rights would lead to huge
growth in car-boot sales, which some research suggests are already visited
by 1m consumers a week, but which can create noise and nuisance, and act as
outlets for stolen, counterfeit or defective goods.
It adds that deregulation of market trading contradicts the policy of
encouraging town-centre development, and could lead to rival markets setting
up outside towns.
The campaign believes there is not enough time to come up with workable
clauses for the deregulation bill, and is calling for separate legislation
at a later date. It proposes:
The replacement of the 6 2/3 -mile rule with one giving local authorities
jurisdiction over markets only within their own administrative areas. That
would remove anomalies such as Liverpool City Council being able to control
markets in neighbouring Knowsley.
A system of local authority registration or licensing of all commercial
markets, including car-boot sales. This would include a right of appeal for
applicants who have been refused. Exemption from the need to register for
markets held for charitable purposes, but with safeguards against abuse.
At a recent meeting at the Department of the Environment, most participants
except the Institute of Directors, which backs the government, broadly
supported these proposals. The Association of Private Market Operators,
representing private markets, also accepted the principles, but wanted
measures included in the deregulation bill.
The parties must now wait to hear the government's new proposals.
Not all traders, however, are concerned. Further up East Street, a man
selling toiletries said he had no objection to car-boot sales. 'Of course
they take trade from us, but everyone has to earn a crust,' he said. 'Good
luck to them.'

FT  10 JUN 94 / Research funding to favour commercial use
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
University research which is directly relevant to commerce and industry is
to receive more funding, under government plans published yesterday.
The quangos which control funding for universities - the higher education
funding councils for England, Scotland and Wales and the Department of
Education for Northern Ireland - said they wanted to address complaints by
employers that funding was skewed towards basic or academic research.
They also intend to implement proposals to improve technology foresight
published in last year's white paper from the Office of Science and
Technology.
The new rules will be applied to the university research assessment exercise
which starts in 1996. The judgments it then makes on the quality of research
will determine research funding from 1997 onwards.
Total government research funding for that year has not yet been decided but
this year's budget from the Department for Education, for English
universities alone, was Pounds 618m.
Mr Bahram Bekhradnia, head of policy for the Higher Education Funding
Council for England, said the council hoped to appoint industrialists to the
panels which will judge the university departments. They would work jointly
with the leading academics who currently control funding.
Requirements that departments submit only published academic research will
be dropped. Now patents, and the results of industrial research undertaken
for companies, will be judged on the same basis.
This means a university doing only industrial research could still attract a
top allocation of research funding if the research is of high quality.
However, Mr Bekhradnia stressed that the aim was only to 'redress the
balance', after criticism that industrial research had been ignored. The
funding councils will not attempt to force universities out of more abstract
basic research.
The English funding council has also stopped the requirement that
departments should submit lists of all articles each researcher has
published. This follows claims that this had led to a 'publish or perish'
attitude, with lecturers publishing work which was incomplete, or trivial.
The grading system has also been made more detailed, with seven quality
grades instead of five.
The Scottish funding council has the power to steer extra funds to specific
subjects if they are important to the local economy. It is still discussing
whether to do so.

FT  10 JUN 94 / Record paid for royal porcelain: Saleroom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A pair of Louis XVI ormolu-mounted Chinese porcelain ewers supplied to
Marie-Antoinette at Versailles and hidden during the revolution, fetched
Pounds 1,046,500 at Christie's yesterday, a record for any French decorative
art.
The violet Kangxi porcelain vessels, 48cm high and bearing exceptional
quality gilt-bronze goat's-head and Bacchic masks, swan-tipped spouts and
scrolling handles, were attributed to the bronzier Pierre Gouthiere, and
were sold by the Trustees of the Luton Hoo Foundation.
Celadon porcelains with flamboyant Louis XV mounts, also from Luton Hoo,
also exceeded expectations, as did a sumptuous red and turquoise
flambe-glazed vase and cover which realised Pounds 298,500.
An auction record for a carpet - Pounds 1,321,500 - was set for a Louis XV
Savonnerie carpet emblazoned with the royal arms of France.
La Fondation Napoleon paid Pounds 62,000 for Bonaparte's necessaire
dentaire, an amboyna box with a chilling array of gold and steel tools,
reputedly acquired by Baron Nathaniel de Rothschild's grandfather from a
soldier who took it from Napoleon's baggage at the battle of Waterloo.
The sale totalled Pounds 6,143,420 with 96 per cent sold.

FT  10 JUN 94 / Call for independent Bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The incoming deputy managing director of the International Monetary Fund, Mr
Stanley Fischer, has called for the Bank of England to be given
independence.
In a paper prepared for the Bank's tercentenary, Mr Fischer concludes: 'On
her 300th birthday, it is time for the Old Lady to be allowed to take on the
responsibilities of independence.'
Last month it was announced that Mr Fischer, an economist at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, would replace Mr Richard Erb as the
IMF's deputy managing director.
In a long paper, Mr Fischer points to empirical studies which have shown
that countries with independent central banks have been more successful at
controlling inflation. 'The relationship between inflation and central bank
independence is attributable mainly to the central bank's ability to use its
policy instruments freely and to the presence of a price-stability goal.'
Mr Fischer suggests that the Bank's mandate should be to achieve price
stability 'by which is meant a low (1 per cent to 3 per cent) average rate
of inflation'. Qualifications to the mandate should be included to allow the
Bank to take account of the short-term trade-off between inflation and
unemployment.
The Bank governor should be made responsible for meeting the targets and
should testify in public twice a year to a House of Commons committee. Mr
Fischer argues that the government should have the right to overrule the
Bank, but only by a public directive, along the lines of the Canadian
system. However, such a public move might lead to the governor's
resignation.
Proposals to make the Bank independent have been backed by former
chancellors Lord Lawson and Mr Norman Lamont.
Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank, has argued that granting independence
to it would be the most likely way of achieving long-term sustainable growth
with low inflation, but this could only happen if there was a public
consensus on the need for independence.

FT  10 JUN 94 / CBI president gives strong warning on wage inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A strong warning about the potential danger to economic recovery from wage
inflation was delivered yesterday by Sir Bryan Nicholson, president of the
Confederation of British Industry.
In a speech to the west Midlands region of the CBI, Sir Bryan said: 'We have
a bleak history of making competitive gains and then throwing them away
needlessly. I am determined that this time we shall not snatch defeat from
the jaws of victory.'
Sir Bryan highlighted sustainable non-inflationary growth as one of the
three main priorities of his two-year term, with improving the
competitiveness of industry and the creation of a deregulated and
business-friendly Europe. He said the City needed particular restraint over
inflationary pay arrangements.
Recent labour-market statistics had disturbed his peace of mind, he said.
'Thanks to growth in average earnings in manufacturing of 4.75 per cent over
the year to March and slower productivity growth of just 2.6 per cent, unit
labour costs in manufacturing are increasing again at 2 per cent a year. Our
competitors are achieving better results which we must match. Unit labour
costs are now falling by 2 per cent a year in Germany and 3 per cent in the
US.'

FT  10 JUN 94 / Savers shrug off C&amp;G cash blow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The counters of the Cheltenham and Gloucester branch in central Birmingham
remain unmarked. There was no storming of these financial barricades
yesterday.
Customers of the building society, which wants to be owned by Lloyds Bank,
generally accepted with cynical resignation the High Court obstacles to
their receipt of unexpected cash presents - Pounds 500 for mortgage holders
and up to Pounds 10,000 for savers.
'It's disappointing, but I wasn't expecting it in the first place. It was
too good to be true,' said Mr Mark Abella, who works in accounts at a
television station. 'You can't rely on things in this day and age. It never
comes off.' But he will not desert the C&amp;G. 'I've got my mortagage with them
and you can't easily pick it up and shift it.' He shrugged his shoulders.
'It's disappointing that a building society like the C&amp;G and a bank like
Lloyds should have gone public before getting clearance,' said Mr Peter
Williams, an educationist.
'They shouldn't offer things they can't deliver. The takeover plan was a
bolt from the blue when it came, and now this . . . ' He hurried away into
the grey drizzle of Temple Street, where the building societies congregate
in Birmingham.
There was a gentle flow of lunchtime customers into the C&amp;G. One woman did
not know there was a takeover in prospect. For others, the takeover and the
court ruling were games other people play. 'It's meaningless to me at the
moment. I'm not really fussed. You can always get money elsewhere,' said one
anonymous small investor.
Mr Ravi Bhardwaj, a trainee solicitor, acknowledged that 'most people would
have been pleasantly surprised if they got a bonus'. But his main concern
was cheap borrowing and good investment returns.
Mrs Sue Darnell, a theatre administrator and a C&amp;G account holder for 15
years, was fed up. 'I've just tried to draw money out of my account. They've
changed the rules about the minimum you can have in the account. They never
advised me.'
It is in such cases that the C&amp;G may be in trouble with its customers.
Another example was Ms Lisa Hurst, a housewife. She was with Heart of
England before C&amp;G took it over. 'I feel duped a bit,' she said. 'To us it's
quite a considerable amount of money and it's money which in my brain I've
spent.'
Mrs Janet Whitehead, an accountant, on the other hand seemed to be enjoying
takeover prospects. 'I'll possibly put a few hundred pounds in another
building society where it looks as if the same thing might happen.' Her next
bet is Birmingham Midshires.

FT  10 JUN 94 / Shortlist for Channel link bidders finalised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The names of the consortia shortlisted to bid for the Pounds 2.7bn
high-speed rail link between London and the Channel tunnel are expected to
be announced by the Department of Transport in the next few days.
Officials yesterday were still negotiating over the membership of some of
the consortia but the chosen bids, barring any last-minute hitches, are
expected to include:
EuroRail, the only all-British bid involving a joint venture between BICC,
Trafalgar House and GEC. The bid is supported by bankers National
Westminster and HongKong and Shanghai Banking Corporation.
London &amp; Continental Railways, involving UK consulting engineers Ove Arup
and Sir William Halcrow; Bechtel, the large US construction group;
Sofrerail, French consultants; National Express, the coach company, and
cement group Blue Circle.
A consortium led by Hochtief, a German construction group supported by
Costain, the UK construction and engineering group; Nishimatsu Construction
of Japan; Siemens and Siemens Transport Systems of Germany, and
Westinghouse, the US engineering group.
It was not clear last night whether a fourth consortium involving UK
construction companies John Mowlem and Taylor Woodrow, and Philipp Holzmann,
a German construction company, would also be included on the shortlist. This
consortium includes Transurb Consultants of Belgium and WS Atkins, the UK
consulting engineers.
London Electricity, the chairman of which is Sir Bob Reid who also chairs
British Rail, yesterday announced it had withdrawn from the EuroRail
consortium because of a possible conflict of interest. Similar horse-trading
is thought to have been occurring between officials and other consortia.
The contract to build and run the 68-mile link will combine private and
public-sector finance under the government's private-finance initiative. The
contract is expected to be awarded early next year. The size of the
public-sector contribution will be an important factor in determining the
winning bid.
The scale of the contract, together with the lack of domestic expertise in
operating privately financed large transport systems, has attracted wide
international interest.
This has been encouraged by the government which wants to increase
competition for privately financed infrastructure projects. Nine consortia
originally asked to be considered for the shortlist. The government has
offered to cover a third of the bid costs of failed bidders, up to a maximum
of Pounds 1.5m.
Final tenders for the link are expected to be submitted by December. The
line will need to be capable of carrying at least six trains an hour each
way at speeds of up to 140mph.

FT  10 JUN 94 / Walker 'kept figures from manager'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A former manager of Brent Walker's film division was always denied access to
the company's accounts, in spite of his requests to see them, he told the
Old Bailey yesterday.
Mr Jonathan Davies, a prosecution witness, was giving evidence during the
trial of Mr George Walker, former chairman and chief executive of the
property and leisure group.
The prosecution alleges Mr Walker and Mr Wilfred Aquilina, the group's
former finance director, fraudulently inflated the profits of both the film
division and the Brent Walker parent company to mislead investors and
creditors.
Mr Davies, general manager of the film division, said he had expected to be
shown at least its sales, turnover, overheads and profit and loss figures.
Although he had requested these management accounts he was never allowed to
see them, he told the court.
He had a number of meetings with Mr Walker to discuss his concerns about the
film division which he thought was failing to fulfil its potential by not
acquiring enough programme material in the then burgeoning market.
Mr Walker was the 'ultimate arbiter' of what he could or could not do.
Before Mr Davies resigned in July 1986, he had been told by Mr Walker not to
conclude any contracts for the sale of film rights.
The prosecution alleges that claims that the division had sold film rights,
when the transactions were ultimately funded by Brent Walker itself, were at
the centre of the fraud.
Mr Davies resigned from Brent Walker after the appointment of Mr John
Quested as managing director of the division. This had led to a conflict of
responsibilities, he said.
The prosecution alleges that Mr Quested also conspired to falsify the Brent
Walker profits. A company he controlled, Universal Talent Management, was
one apparent buyer in the bogus film rights transactions, it claims.
Mr Walker denies the theft of Pounds 17m from Brent Walker, false accounting
and conspiring to falsify the company's accounts. Mr Aquilina denies charges
of theft, false accounting and conspiracy to falsify the accounts.
The trial continues today.

FT  10 JUN 94 / Broadcast unions at the pain threshold: Rapid changes at the
BBC have left staff mistrustful of management
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY and ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As strikes go, yesterday's second 24-hour stoppage at the BBC seemed
good-natured.
'Please don't break our strike,' said the senior radio journalist politely
to the few people making their way past the pickets through the heavy doors
of Broadcasting House in central London.
Yet the journalists and other broadcasting staff felt strongly enough about
management proposals to introduce performance pay and decentralised
negotiations on some aspects of terms and conditions that they left their
posts on the day of voting in the European elections and in five
by-elections - a day that could define the future of Mr John Major, the
prime minister.
The dispute - which is ostensibly about the nitty-gritty details of
performance pay and the exact nature of what can be negotiated at divisional
level - is fuelled by more than three years of rapid change and pain at the
BBC.
Last year 1,500 jobs were lost in the resource departments, which provide
everything from studios to editing. A further 700 will go this year, partly
a result of the move towards the target of having 25 per cent of BBC output
produced by independent companies.
Working relationships have been altered radically by Producer Choice, the
system that allows producers to buy in services from the open market.
It is a dispute marked by the staff's lack of trust in middle management.
Ironically Mr John Birt, the BBC director-general, appears sympathetic and
has said in public that his next task at the BBC is to do something about a
middle-management structure which he believes is too hierarchical and rigid.
Yet last night all the signs were that the two sides were digging in on
matters of principle, with senior management making it clear that
concessions offered in talks last week - such as accepting that everyone
will receive the negotiated standard pay increase each year - represented
the final offer.
Mr Bob Phillis, BBC deputy director-general, said last night: 'Unless we
have some element of pay which reflects performance, how on earth can we
retain, attract and reward high-quality staff?'
Mr Phillis said he would have preferred the management's final package -
offered after negotiations at Acas, the conciliation service, last week - to
have been put to union members in a ballot. The unions are taking action
under a strike ballot held on the management's original proposals.
Officials of the National Union of Journalists and Bectu, the main technical
union at the BBC, said yesterday that they had presented the BBC's revised
proposals honestly to their members at meetings.
Ms Christina Driver, national industrial officer at the BBC for Bectu, said
yesterday: 'We told the members we had not got what they wanted and no
significant gains had been made, but that there had been some movement. The
members were very strongly against acceptance of the offer.'
The union meetings - attended by about half the staff - rejected any
suggestion that the BBC offer should be put to a postal ballot because they
felt it would take too long and weaken momentum in the dispute.
Only about 40 per cent of members in either Bectu or the NUJ voted for
strike action in the initial postal ballots. Bectu members voted 61.3 per
cent in favour of stoppages. Support among NUJ members was 79.3 per cent.
The unions accept that the management did make some concessions in the four
days of talks at Acas to try to reassure staff about future conditions of
service, but they believe these did not go far enough to calm fears.
Ms Driver said: 'There is a crisis of morale among staff. It comes down to a
question of trust. They do not believe line managers will schedule their
work humanely without the protection of clear national agreements with the
unions.'
The unions want a national agreement on conditions of service to protect
working time and compensation payments for breaches of it.
BBC staff also oppose the corporation's plan to give line managers wider
discretion in deciding the implementation of performance pay for individuals
with no appeals procedure available, except for those facing possible pay
cuts.
The unions want every job to have an identifiable pay rate attached to it,
conditional on a 'fully competent' work performance. The new system would
also end annual increments for staff and national wage deals.
Ms Driver said: 'We believe this is a recipe for unfair and discriminatory
treatment. It will not deliver equal pay for work of equal value.'
The BBC believes its proposals will make the corporation more competitive so
it will be able to pay more competitive salaries as an integral part of the
modernising programme.
It is seen as ironic that industrial action taking programmes off the
screens is coming when the most painful period of change is over and when
the corporation is about to announce higher-than-expected savings of Pounds
125m this year - money that will be spent on programmes.
But as the top BBC management prepare today to take their case to staff
throughout the corporation, union feelings are running high. The NUJ says as
many as 600 BBC staff have joined or rejoined the union during the dispute.

FT  10 JUN 94 / Ofgas competition and tariffs director to return to DTI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM LEWIS and DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Greg McGregor, Ofgas director of competition and tariffs, is to leave the
gas industry regulator to take up a new post at the Department of Trade and
Industry.
His departure is seen by independent gas suppliers as a setback for plans by
the government and Ofgas to open up the domestic gas market.
'This is a real blow as Greg was one of the few people in Ofgas with
experience,' one executive from an independent gas company said.
Mr McGregor's move to the deregulation unit of the DTI follows a series of
difficulties encountered by Ms Clare Spottiswoode, Ofgas director-general.
Ms Spottiswoode was recently the target of a smear campaign which centred on
unfounded allegations about her private life and the closeness of her
working relationship with Mr John Michell, a senior DTI official.
Ofgas itself launched an unofficial probe in an attempt to find the source
of the stories but has not made any announcement.
Mr McGregor, employed by Ofgas for four years, was heavily involved in
writing the recently published joint DTI-Ofgas consultation document on the
introduction of competition in the domestic market.
As the director of competition and tariffs he played a central role for
Ofgas in its evidence to last year's Monopolies and Mergers Commission
investigation into the gas industry.
One gas consultant said yesterday: 'Mr McGregor and Clare never really saw
eye to eye.' He added that Mr McGregor had joined Ofgas at a time when Sir
James McKinnon, then director-general, was at the height of his difficulties
with British Gas.
One of Ms Spottiswoode's first decisions as director-general was to abolish
the post of deputy director-general. Mr McGregor's move leaves Ms
Spottiswoode and Ms Eileen Marshall, chief economics adviser, as the most
senior Ofgas staff.
Ofgas said yesterday that Mr McGregor had spent four years at Ofgas on
secondment from the DTI and that it was normal for him to be returning now.
'The DTI has a lot of work for him to do over there.'
No decision has been made on his replacement and Ms Marshall will take over
his duties meanwhile.
An Ofgas official said yesterday that the long-awaited consultation paper on
the rate of return British Gas will be allowed to earn from its
transportation assets would be released early next week. He added: 'At the
moment it is looking like it will be released on Monday. There are no
surprises or anything radical.'

FT  10 JUN 94 / Home Office accused of detention centre cover-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Home Office was accused yesterday of covering up injuries sustained by
detainees during the riot at Campsfield House detention centre near Oxford
last Sunday night.
The Oxford-based Campaign to Close Campsfield said it had eyewitness and
film evidence to show that 'at least eight people' - all in Britain seeking
political asylum - were removed in four ambulances while an 'unknown number'
were removed in three more.
The Home Office has said only four people were injured.
The campaign also cited eyewitness accounts stating that 'a detainee jumped
head-first off the roof in protest, and that he had clearly sustained
serious injuries to his head'. Mr Bill MacKeith, president of Oxford Trade
Union Council, said the riot had been provoked by 'the removal, without
warning or justification' of an Algerian citizen for summary deportation the
next day from Gatwick.
After the riot, however, the government said the trouble had been stirred up
by demonstrators outside the fence.
On Monday Mr Charles Wardle, the junior Home Office minister, said the
student who had been deported had gone to Algeria voluntarily on September 2
but had then returned two months later using a forged passport.

FT  10 JUN 94 / CrossRail backer confident of revival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London Transport, a backer of the Pounds 2bn CrossRail project to build an
underground rail link between east and west London, said yesterday that it
was confident the venture could be revived.
CrossRail was rejected last month by the four-MP committee studying the
proposal under the Commons private bill procedure.
London Transport, co-promoter with British Rail, believes it will find
enough backing in parliament for a motion to send the proposal back to the
committee.
Mr David Lidington, MP for Aylesbury, one of the towns which would be linked
to CrossRail, is working to obtain signatures for a motion to revive the
bill. If there is sufficient backing it could be put to the Commons after it
reassembles on Tuesday.
The CrossRail project team is willing to revise the proposal to create
connections with the Heathrow Express service from Paddington in west London
and with the Channel tunnel rail link at Stratford in east London. Links
could be established with other routes such as the London-Tilbury-Southend
and the Northampton lines.
London Transport expects the London economy to improve so that most of the
job losses which occurred during the recession will be made good, justifying
the building of the link.
London Transport has spent just more than Pounds 100m on CrossRail and is
continuing to spend at the rate of Pounds 1m a month. It believes that
private partners could be persuaded to provide between 40 per cent and 50
per cent of the finance.
A consultant calculated, however, that private investors would be willing to
provide only between a quarter and a third of the funds required. He said
the project needed to be re-designed to provide a cheaper, more
cost-effective link.
London Transport expects to announce later this month that it made an
operating profit, before restructuring costs, of Pounds 5m in the year ended
March 31, its best result in 10 years. It made a loss of Pounds 77m in the
previous year.

FT  10 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Salinas may join race to head WTO
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER and GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Carlos Salinas of Mexico is considering joining the race to become
head of the World Trade Organisation, due to succeed the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade next year.
'Mexico's Foreign Ministry has recognised the pronouncements in favour of
President Salinas, and is exploring to see whether there is a consensus for
his candidacy,' a spokesman for the president said yesterday. 'This does not
imply a decision has been taken.'
The Mexican government is understood already to have taken soundings at the
most senior level in the US State Department and the office of President
Clinton's trade representative about how Washington would view Mr Salinas's
candidacy for the WTO.
Should he decide to stand, he would be the most heavyweight political figure
to enter a race in which the two declared candidates to date are Mr Renato
Ruggiero, an Italian former trade minister, and Mr Rubens Ricupero, Brazil's
finance minister.
However, Mr Salinas's entry could also split support in Latin America, which
the Brazilian government hopes to rally behind Mr Ricupero.
Another Mexican government official said Mr Salinas would be looking at it
'very keenly, very seriously' but would probably not decide before Mexico's
presidential election on August 21.
Mr Salinas's six-year term ends in December. However, for domestic political
reasons, he cannot be seen to campaign too openly for the WTO job before the
election.
There has long been speculation that Mr Salinas, 46, would seek a senior
position in an international organisation after leaving the presidency. An
official who knows him well said the WTO job 'would be an important activity
for an ex-president, and a job that he could do very well'.
Mexico's state-owned news agency reported Mr Manuel Tello, foreign minister,
as saying in Paris this week that there exists 'favourable conditions that a
person with the profile of Salinas heads the nascent organisation.
'Taking into account the decisions of Salinas in favour of free trade, (it
is probable that) his name begins to circulate more and more as a possible
candidate for secretary-general of the WTO.'
Mr Pedro Solbes, Spain's finance minister, has recently quoted as saying
that Mr Salinas was a 'suitable candidate', and that were he to be appointed
head of the organisation 'we could not be in better hands'.
However, the Spanish government is expected to support whichever candidate
is endorsed by other European Union leaders. At present, Mr Ruggiero is the
clear favourite.

Cambodia is planning to introduce a new 'liberal' investment law, which is
aimed at attracting foreign companies into specific sectors of the country's
economy, agencies report from Canberra.
Mr Ith Vichit, secretary-general of the National Investment Committee, said
priority investment areas would be in the rural and export sectors and in
industries with high job creation. The central authorities would try to
decentralise industry to provincial areas, and had started planning foreign
investment zones, particularly for light industries.

The Japanese authorities have decided not to sanction certain types of
reverse engineering whereby software programmes are decompiled so that their
contents can be analysed and recompiled in different form, writes Michiyo
Nakamoto in Tokyo.
A report by the Agency of Cultural Affairs decided not to include a
recommendation endorsing reverse engineering. The decision follows a formal
US complaint last year over the Japanese move to recommend legalising
software decompilation and is likely to ease tension with the US over
intellectual property rights. In reverse engineering, the binary code of a
software programme is translated into readable form and then recompiled into
a new programme slightly different from the original.
The process enables companies to pirate software programmes of others but is
also useful to ensure that new software programmes are compatible with
existing systems.

<TEXT>
Singapore yesterday confirmed its intention to begin liberalising its
telecommunications services by granting a second licence to operate mobile
cellular services in 1997, writes Andrew Adonis.
Mr Mah Bow Tan, Singapore's communications minister, said the move reflected
Singapore's 'pro-competition' stance, and its determination to make the
country a telecoms hub for Asia.
However, Singapore's fixed-wire network will remain a monopoly for Singapore
Telecom for another 13 years, and analysts doubted the value of the mobile
cellular contract on its own.
Singapore already has one of the world's highest levels of cellular phone
usage per head - 6.2 cellular subscribers per 100 people - and the new
operator will not be able to launch a network for another three years.

FT  10 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Reich warns on rights of workers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
In the clearest statement yet of Washington's position on worker rights and
trade, Mr Robert Reich, US labour secretary, yesterday said trade sanctions
should be just one option in a 'menu' of possible international responses to
rights abuses.
Mr Reich, addressing the annual conference of the International Labour
Organisation, also drew a firm distinction between a few 'absolute
standards' which all countries should respect and other labour standards
which could be expected to improve with rising levels of development.
The US has led a campaign by industrialised nations for the links between
'internationally-recognised labour standards' and trade to go on the agenda
for future trade talks. This continues to be resisted by many developing
countries, which fear concern over worker rights is a pretext for putting up
trade barriers against low-wage nations.
Mr Reich outlined 'a short list' of core labour standards, including prison
and slave labour, some forms of child labour such as work by very young
children, and restrictions on trade union organisation and collective
bargaining. 'Some labour practices simply place countries outside the
community of civilised nations,' he said.
Beyond that core, the international community could not dictate working
hours, minimum wages, benefits, or health and safety standards which matched
those of the rich industrial nations. However, it did have a legitimate
interest in seeing standards rise with development. Countries with rising
living standards offered growing markets for other countries' exports, he
said.
One test of whether labour standards were improving as economies grew richer
was the existence of democratic institutions. Where these were lacking, a
worsening of the position of low-wage workers, and a widening of the income
gap between rich and poor, would suggest deliberate suppression of worker
rights 'to serve narrow commercial interests'.
However, Mr Reich did not see trade sanctions as the inevitable response to
abuses. He said trade itself could be a catalyst for progressive change.
Other remedies could include technical assistance to help raise standards,
worldwide publicity for abuses and exclusion from international grant and
loan programmes.
International intervention should also be 'authorised and implemented
multilaterally' if possible and aimed at bringing about change in offending
nations.

FT  10 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Eunetcom wins Dollars 200m contract
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The telecommunications joint venture between the French and German state
operators has won a Dollars 200m (Pounds 133m) contract to provide
international data services to Dun &amp; Bradstreet, the US information and
business services group.
Eunetcom, the Franco-German joint venture, will provide all of D&amp;B's
worldwide data communications needs, taking responsibility for an existing
network covering 30 countries, run by more than 150 staff.
The contract, Eunetcom's most significant advance so far in the market for
'outsourcing' the telecoms needs of multinationals, comes amid negotiations
between the Franco- German alliance and Sprint, the third-largest US long
distance operator, about the formation of a larger alliance.
Eunetcom is believed to have won the D&amp;B contract against strong competition
from British Telecommunications and MCI, the second largest US telecoms
operator.
BT and MCI forged a Dollars 5.3bn alliance last year geared to the
outsourcing market, estimated by analysts to be worth at least Dollars 1bn a
year in Europe.
France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom launched Eunetcom last September, and
have since announced an Ecu1bn (Pounds 770m) alliance to fully integrate
their data communications services.
Mr Claude Olier, Eunetcom chief executive, said: 'This proves that Eunetcom
is set to play a big role in the international outsourcing market: we are
not going to leave it to AT&amp;T and BT.' He added that up to 25 other
contracts were in various stages of tendering, and that the saving on offer
to companies outsourcing their telecoms was 'between 10 and 20 per cent of
their current bill'.
Eunetcom's opponents in the fast emerging global struggle for
multinationals' telecoms business are AT&amp;T, the US operator, the BT-MCI
alliance, and Unisource, a joint venture between the Swedish, Swiss and
Dutch state operators.
Unisource is working with AT&amp;T in one significant European contract, and
analysts believe a full alliance may be in the offing. An announcement by
Sprint about its relations with France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom is
expected within the next 10 days.

<TEXT>
Malaysia is seeking clarification from the British government over remarks
by Mr Richard Needham, the UK trade minister, suggesting that calls in
Britain for retaliation against Malaysia might grow unless Kuala Lumpur
lifts a ban on giving contracts to UK companies.
Visiting Malaysia this week, Mr Needham said he felt the ban, imposed at the
end of February, would be lifted 'within six weeks'. However, he said that
as long as the ban was in force there was a chance that calls for some sort
of retaliatory action would increase.
Mr Abu Hassan Omar, the acting Malaysian foreign minister, said Malaysia
hoped for a quick response on the issue from the British government. While
the reaction of the Malaysian government to Mr Needham's remarks has been
muted, the government-influenced local media have sought to interpret the
comments as a slight to the government.
Mr Needham has played a central role in trying to persuade the Malaysians to
lift the ban, imposed after a report in the London Sunday Times alleged that
a British company had been involved in negotiations to offer bribes to Dr
Mahathir Mohamad, the prime minister.

FT  10 JUN 94 / What world donors did not know about Kenya frauds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When international creditors pledged Dollars 850m to Kenya's economic
recovery programme last November, they did so in the knowledge that
newly-appointed reformers in the finance ministry and the central bank were
committed to cleaning up Kenya's financial system. What they did not know
was the scale and systematic nature of corruption at the Central Bank of
Kenya.
What began in 1991 as the crude falsification of export invoices to benefit
from government export incentive schemes, escalated over the next two years
into a series of financial frauds, estimated to have cost Kenya Dollars
430m, according to unpublished official estimates - equivalent to 10 per
cent of the country's annual gross domestic product.
The financial irregularities drew in CBK officials, Kenyan businessmen,
senior politicians and ultimately two international banks. The scams are
understood to have fuelled already excessive money supply and inflation,
increased the government's domestic debt, and contributed to the devaluation
of the Kenyan shilling by 47 per cent in 1993.
Although the irregularities were unravelled by auditors working at the
request of the International Monetary Fund, a full account of their findings
was never passed on to donors. Documents obtained by the Financial Times,
recent comments of Mr Micah Cheserem, the new CBK governor, and the arrest
last week of a leading Kenyan businessman and four former CBK officials are
helping to bring the details of the fraud to light.
In 1991, Goldenberg International, a Nairobi trading company, owned by Mr
Kamlesh Pattni, Kenyan businessman and owner of Exchange Bank, was granted
sole rights by the finance ministry to export diamond jewellery and gold
from Kenya. The company claimed to be exporting, but there was no evidence
of this in customs statistics, although it earned Dollars 45m from the
government's export incentive scheme. Kenya's auditor general noted in his
1993 report that the export compensation had been paid irregularly.
Mr Pattni and others went on to tap the CBK's pre-shipment finance facility,
a source of credit so widely abused it was closed at the insistence of the
IMF in March 1993. But there were other scams at the CBK that profited
several of Kenya's commercial banks.
According to an IMF report, domestic banks obtained irregular access to CBK
credit by holding large overdrafts with the CBK and persistent deficiencies
in meeting statutory cash ratios.
The CBK is investigating theft and possible forgery of some Dollars 200m of
Foreign Exchange Certificates - bearer bonds entitling the holder to hard
currency when dollars were still rationed in Kenya.
In addition, the IMF report says domestic banks, in forward contracts with
the CBK, received advances in local currency, but delayed the delivery of
foreign exchange or defaulted on payment outright.
Mr Pattni's Exchange Bank defaulted on its contract by which it had obtained
KSh9.9bn in April 1993 against the future repayment of Dollars 210m. The
irregular outstanding credit then at its peak was estimated to be up to
KSh24bn.
To erase liabilities incurred by the forex fraud, CBK officials devised
fictitious hard currency deposits in two UK accounts to make CBK'S foreign
exchange reserves seem greater than they were.
According to Mr Francois Vikar, communications director at Banque Indosuez
in Paris, Mr SA Taheri, former deputy chairman and chief executive officer
of Exchange Bank, introduced CBK officials to Indosuez Aval, a UK subsidiary
of Banque Indosuez.
The contract establishing the account for a fictitious deposit was signed on
June 10 by Indosuez Aval's chief executive, Mr DI Guild and Mr Job Kilach,
head of the CBK's foreign department, and Mr Michael Wanjihia, chief foreign
exchange dealer.
Mr Vikar insists Indosuez Aval 'in no way knowingly participated' in
concealment of financial regularities. He says: 'To make things look
absolutely normal', Indosuez Aval made interest payments on the fictitious
deposits using moneys made available from a CBK advance.
Certainly Indosuez Aval knew that the CBK wanted 'to make itself look as
good as possible . . . before the visit of IMF officials'.
Mr Vikar acknowledges that Indosuez Aval was 'doing window-dressing'. But it
was 'not doing hanky-panky'.
The cover-up came to light, however, when the CBK was asked why it did not
meet its foreign debt obligations when it had significant cash reserves
abroad. The accounts were then closed.
A full chronicle of the irregularities was presented in July to reformist
finance minister Musalia Mudavadi in a report by an independent team lead by
Price Waterhouse, the accountants. Mr Mudavadi responded to its findings by
ordering the closure of Exchange Bank, Pan African Bank and Post Bank
Credit. In the same week, Mr Eric Kotut, the CBK governor, resigned, but
denied wrong-doing.
In an attempt to recover some of the moneys the CBK has seized several of Mr
Pattni's assets, including the five-star Grand Regency Hotel in the centre
of Nairobi.
Last week, Mr Pattni was charged, along with four former CBK officials
including Mr Kilach and Mr Wanjihia, in a Nairobi court with stealing a
total of KSh9.9bn from CBK.
The full explanation of irregularities in Kenya's banking sector was shown
to the IMF. International donors, including the World Bank, however, have
not seen the auditors' report.
At a conference on Kenya's aid chaired by the World Bank in Paris in
November donors and lending institutions endorsed the Kenyan government
reforms by ending a two-year aid freeze with a pledge of Dollars 850m.

that unless donors disburse aid within days, the Palestinian administration
will be unable to meet June salaries for policemen and civil servants.
Mr Sha'ath presented the Paris meetings with a Dollars 381m (Pounds 254m)
annual spending budget for the Palestinian National Authority. The
Palestinians hope to raise Dollars 204m from taxes and customs and want
donors to meet the Dollars 177m deficit.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
South African President Nelson Mandela and other southern African leaders
yesterday urged foreign businesses to invest in the region and pledged to
work quickly towards a regional free trade treaty and common market.
Speaking to several hundred business leaders from around the world at a
meeting of the World Economic Forum in Cape Town, President Mandela declared
South Africa's support for the creation of free trade agreement between
eastern and southern African states and said he hoped an African common
market would be established 'in the near future'.
President Joaquim Chissano of Mozambique, President Robert Mugabe of
Zimbabwe and President Ali Hassan Mwinyi of Tanzania, who also addressed the
summit as part of a panel, made similar commitments. They said the demise of
apartheid in South Africa meant that, for the first time, frontline states
were able to enter into a co-operative relationship with their giant
neighbour to the south.
Over the past few months there has been widespread debate over future
economic plans for the southern African region, with most neighbouring
countries eager to encourage the export of South African skills and
investments but fearful the country might use its power to gain regional
domination.
The meeting appeared to indicate a desire on both sides to approach the
issue cautiously, while highlighting to the rest of the world that most
countries in the region were now politically stable and supportive of free
market policies.
Mr Mandela's speech opening the two-day meeting, was clearly designed to
reassure potential investors about the new government's commitment to a
stable, free market economy.
He pledged his government would not pursue any policies that might 'upset
market balance and undermine fiscal stability'.
President Mandela also insisted the government would not consider
nationalising industries, although it was still a strategy that could be
used at 'appropriate time' such as after a war. However he was vehemently
opposed to any further privatisation of state corporations.

FT  10 JUN 94 / Contact made with Moslem kidnappers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL, Asia Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Indian authorities have established indirect contact with the group of
Moslem militants holding two Britons in Indian-held Kashmir.
Mr David Housego, a Delhi-based businessman whose 16-year-old son Kim is one
of the captives, said yesterday the contact was informal and tentative. He
was cautious about rumours circulating in Kashmir of their impending
release.
Police believed a doctor had attended to the other captive, Mr David Mackie,
36, a video director, who had a knee injury.
'What the authorities hope is that once they begin to establish contact,
they will have a better idea of their location and can begin negotiations,'
said Mr Housego, a former New Delhi correspondent of the Financial Times who
has considerable experience of Kashmir.
It seemed the captors were repeating their demand for three jailed guerrilla
leaders to be freed. A note left on Tuesday had sought their release, but
the Harkat-ul-Ansar militant group later issued statements saying the
kidnappers aimed only to draw attention to human rights abuses in Kashmir.
Speaking by telephone from Srinagar, Mr Housego said the militants seemed
likely to take their lead from groups in Pakistan and from Mr Gulbuddin
Hekmatyar, the guerrilla leader who is prime minister of Afghanistan. The
captors were mostly Pathans.
Mr Housego said statements by the Pakistani government and militant groups
based in Pakistan, urging the release of the Britons, had helped.
Mr and Mrs Housego and their son were robbed by gunmen while trekking
south-east of Srinagar on Monday. They were taken to a guest house where Mr
and Mrs Mackie were being held. During Monday night, their captors abducted
Kim Housego and Mr Mackie.
It was thought in Srinagar that Indian troops would seek to avoid
intervention by large units, which could alarm the captors into a
gun-battle. Earlier this year, an Indian army officer kidnapped by
Harkat-ul-Ansar was killed in a shoot-out when the Indian army attacked
their hideout.
Mr Housego appealed for the help of Moslem guerrilla leaders in securing the
release of the captives. 'I do not see how kidnapping a boy of 16 serves the
cause of Islam or of Kashmiris,' he wrote in a letter to Mr Syed Salahuddin,
leader of Kashmir's fundamentalist Hizb-ul Mujahideen group.

China yesterday again rejected efforts by South Korea to persuade it to
support sanctions against the north because of Pyongyang's refusal to open
its nuclear sites to inspection.
At the same time Mr Kim Yong-nam, North Korea's foreign minister, threatened
the south with devastation if war broke out between the two countries.
'They should remember that if they blindly follow the policies of the United
States as to sanctions and finally start a war, then in the end South Korea
will be devastated,' Mr Kim told Reuters at the end of a visit to Ukraine.
'We have the strength to protect ourselves from sanctions and it is
unbelievably powerful. . . I would like to peacefully advise those who want
to start a war in Korea,' he said.
The foreign ministry in Pyongyang also said that Japan could expect
reprisals if it joined in sanctions.
Japan and South Korea are backing a plan by the US to ask the United Nations
Security Council to approve phased sanctions to force North Korea to comply
with international demands for access to its reactors and waste storage
areas.
But in Beijing, Mr Shen Guofang, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, said
'sanctions would only serve to push the opposing sides into confrontation
with one another and result in a situation no one would like to see'.
The foreign ministry official was speaking just hours after Mr Han Sung-joo,
South Korea's foreign minister, visited Beijing seeking Chinese
co-operation. China, as a permanent member of the Security Council, has veto
power over a sanctions resolution. Beijing is arguing more time is needed
for dialogue, but recognises that time is running short.
China has been sending mixed signals on the North Korean issue. At the
weekend, a Beijing-funded Hong Kong newspaper raised the spectre of
sanctions in a prominent article unlikely to have been published without
official encouragement.
However, in Beijing this week Chinese officials have been at pains to
emphasise the importance of relations with Pyongyang. President Jiang Zemin
told the visiting North Korean Chief of Army General Staff that
strengthening Sino-Korean relations was China's 'firm policy'.
Western officials say China is engaged in a delicate manoeuvre aimed at
defusing the crisis over North Korea's apparent diversion of weapons-grade
plutonium and preserving its relationship with its neighbour and Korean-war
partner. Beijing fears sanctions would further isolate North Korea.

FT  10 JUN 94 / Japan's past precedes emperor's US visit: Ambiguity over war
record surrounds imperial tour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Emperor Akihito of Japan starts his first imperial visit to the US today
with a mixture of friendship and sad wartime memories on his mind.
The emperor's 17-day tour will end with a poignant reminder of Japan's
ambiguous feelings over its wartime record. In this there is a parallel with
Germany's uncomfortable complexes over the recent D-Day landing
celebrations. For Japan the equivalent will come under the spotlight next
year, the 50th anniversary of the end of the Pacific war.
As the Normandy surf erases the tracks of Europe's D-Day celebrations,
Emperor Akihito will stop in Hawaii on his way home to lay a wreath at the
US national memorial cemetery of the Pacific, the Punch Bowl.
The emperor's gesture, to the sadness of some in Washington, falls short of
the Japanese government's original plan for him to visit the USS Arizona
memorial in Pearl Harbour, a battleship sunk by the Japanese attack on
December 7 1941. That idea was dropped because of fierce objections from
Japanese right-wing politicians and commentators, many of whom believe the
1941 attack was unavoidable, maybe even justified.
Officially, the emperor is so mystically elevated that he must get less
involved in temporal affairs than his high profile counterparts in the
British or Spanish royal families.
So he politely declined last week to comment on whether or not the Pearl
Harbour attack could be justified, beyond saying that the war lay heavy on
his heart. 'It is very important to understand historical truths correctly,
but because of my position, I must refrain from touching on this kind of
subject,' he said.
Yet at the same time, Emperor Akihito has deliberately descended just a
little closer to earth than his father, Hirohito, a mark of the gradual
evolution of the world's oldest unbroken imperial dynasty.
Emperor Akihito was the first to ascend the Chrysanthemum throne, in 1989,
as a human symbol of the state, rather than a god. His father, Hirohito was
born the Son of Heaven, but was obliged by the US occupiers after the war to
renounce his divinity.
As such, Emperor Akihito appears to be trying to play a subtle, yet emotive
role in shaping Japan's attempt publicly to come to terms with its wartime
past, the prerequisite for success in its campaign to become a fully fledged
member of the international community.
In this, the Emperor is in tune with a gathering mood of wartime regret in
mainstream Japan, in line with his traditional role of embodying the
national spirit. Former prime minister Mr Morihiro Hosokawa's
unprecedentedly explicit apologies over Japan's wartime record and the
recent re-writing of school textbooks to include more detail of that record
are the latest signs of this.
While feelings of atonement are on the rise, there is certainly no common
view on war history, one of the several areas in which fault lines are
appearing in Japan's famous consensus.
There is a dangerous nationalist minority, as shown by the recent gun attack
against Mr Hosokawa by a right-wing protestor, angered at his wartime
apologies. The denial two months ago by a justice minister that an infamous
wartime atrocity never happened, damaged Tokyo's increasingly vital Asian
relations. The minister resigned, but the suspicions he aroused will be hard
to soothe.
To some, the significance of Emperor Akihito's role as a public figure is
ambiguous, as shown by the response of Mr Shintaro Ishihara, a right-wing
member of the opposition Liberal Democratic party, to the aborted Pearl
Harbour visit.
'I have never heard of a US president visiting the memorial hall in
Hiroshima,' he said, drawing a temporal comparison. Yet Mr Ishihara a moment
later elevated Emperor Akihito to semi-divinity. 'The emperor is the only
priest king in the world. I think it is good for the emperor to be mystical.
If the emperor is not mystical, he will no longer be eternal,' he argues.
The emperor has in the first five years of his reign worked hard to
contribute, as a globe trotting ambassador, to Japan's temporal interests.
He has already visited the US twice in his official capacity as Crown
Prince. His father made the trip once.
Two years ago, Emperor Akihito became the first Japanese emperor to visit
China, so helping to clear the way for closer economic and diplomatic links.
At the time, he pleased the Chinese government by saying he 'deeply
deplored' the suffering caused during the Japanese occupation. He stopped
short of apologising.
Earlier this year, Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko paid the first
imperial visit to the war memorial of Iwo Jima, a small Pacific island where
many thousands of US and Japanese were killed. He carefully referred, at the
time, to the dead of both sides.
Akihito hopes that the US visit will, as the one to China did, bring closer
ties. Of course he refrains from noting that his US tour is most timely,
just as a growing number of senior Tokyo government officials are getting
anxious that the strain in trade relations might spill over into political
and security relations.
Accordingly, the imperial couple have accepted a punishing schedule,
including 11 cities, starting in Atlanta today. They proceed to Washington
tomorrow, where they will be the guests of honour on Monday at the first
full state dinner of Bill Clinton's presidency, a protocol compliment that
will not be lost on Japan's humble emperor.

FT  10 JUN 94 / Keating 'tried to influence Fairfax press'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
An Australian parliamentary inquiry has found Mr Paul Keating, the country's
prime minister, attempted 'improperly to influence the political coverage of
Fairfax newspapers' by offering Mr Conrad Black, the Canadian media tycoon,
'the prospect of increased investment in Fairfax in return for balanced
coverage'.
It also put forward some strong recommendations regarding the country's
Foreign Investment Review Board, which decides whether foreign investment is
contrary to the national interest, and the guidelines to which FIRB works.
In particular, it has accused FIRB of being 'excessively secretive' and
unaccountable, and recommended it be replaced by a new statutory authority,
responsible for administering foreign investment policies in 'non-key'
industry sectors.
In sectors such as the media, the responsibility would fall directly to the
Treasurer, who would make decisions on 'national interest' grounds, but be
required to publish the reasoning for each decision. The Senate committee
was set up last year, to study circumstances surrounding Mr Black's
acquisition of Fairfax in 1991. Fairfax publishes three of Australia's top
daily papers: the Sydney Morning Herald, Melbourne Age and Financial Review.
The company had gone into receivership, triggering a battle for its
ownership. This was won by Mr Black's Tourang consortium, though his
British-based Telegraph group's holding was initially pegged at 15 per cent.
This was lifted to 25 per cent after the 1993 election, which Mr Keating's
Labor Party won.
The trigger-points for the inquiry were a disclosure in Mr Black's
autobiography that, before the election, Mr Keating said an increase in the
Telegraph's holding would be entertained if Fairfax's coverage was
'balanced'; the prime minister's own admission that he told Mr Black that if
he 'barracked for the (opposition) coalition ..then there's no way you would
qualify as the kind of owner we would like'; and long-running
dissatisfaction with FIRB procedures.
The inquiry's conclusions on the Black-Keating affair was based on a
majority opinion, written by five opposition and minor party senators on the
nine-person committee. The four Labor Party members of the inquiry
dissented, saying the investigation had been a blatant political exercise.
Yesterday, Mr Michael Lavarch, Australia's attorney-general, and one of the
small number of senior government figures not overseas at present, also
claimed that its conclusions were flawed.
'The finding against the prime minister appears to be based on a jaundiced
view of one remark,' he said. Mr Keating had declined to appear before the
committee. The majority and minority reports suggested changes to foreign
investment decisions, to make the process more open, though the latter
favoured retaining FIRB. The findings are unlikely to have direct political
consequences for Mr Keating.

FT  10 JUN 94 / Congress moves on healthcare
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US Congress has at last started to make some procedural progress in its
efforts to draft healthcare legislation, but consensus on how to reform the
system is as far away as ever.
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, chairman of the Senate finance committee,
yesterday presented his committee members with a proposal closely modelled
on President Bill Clinton's reform plan, while the House of Representatives
ways and means committee, which handles tax issues, is expected to start
next week on line-by-line consideration of a bill proposed by its new
chairman, Congressman Sam Gibbons of Florida.
The Senate labour committee, chaired by Senator Ted Kennedy, was meanwhile
expected by last night to become the first of the five big congressional
committees with jurisdiction over healthcare to complete its work on a bill
that also bears a close resemblance to the Clinton plan.
Even their proponents do not suggest that any of these versions is close to
being the sort of magic compromise that could pass both the House and the
Senate.
'The important thing is that the main committees get bills marked up, then
we can slug it out on the floor,' an administration official said.
Mr Kennedy has achieved some progress, winning unanimous votes on a handful
of measures that could form part of the final bill. On most measures,
however, his committee, regarded as more left-wing than the Senate as a
whole, has split along party lines.
The only Republican to vote consistently with the Democrats was Senator
James Jeffords of Vermont, who is generally far more left-wing than most
centrist Democrats.
Mr Moynihan, meanwhile, has failed after weeks of negotiations to come up
with the Republican support that he has said is essential for the passage of
healthcare reform.
His proposal broadly follows the Clinton plan, including the requirement
that employers pay 80 per cent of the cost of health insurance for their
employees.
But congressional healthcare experts said yesterday that Mr Moynihan's
purpose was to prove to the White House that its scheme is truly dead, by
demonstrating how little support it gets in his committee.
Other centrist senators are working on proposals aimed at finessing the
controversial employer mandate while still reaching universal coverage.
Among these ideas is a 'hard trigger', in which the employer mandate would
only come into effect if, after a specified number of years, market reforms
in a voluntary system have not resulted in 85 per cent of currently
uninsured workers obtaining coverage.

The US Justice Department said yesterday it had cracked a price-fixing
conspiracy among three plastic cutlery manufacturers that controlled over 90
per cent of the Dollars 100m-a-year US market.
Following joint raids by the Federal Bureau of Investigations and the Royal
Canadian Mounted Police, the department charged that executives at
Minnesota-based Plastics Inc, Pennsylvania-based Polar Plastics and
Massachusetts-based Comet Products had agreed in secret telephone
conversations and meetings to drive up prices on disposable cups and glasses
from December 1991 to December 1992.
The three companies have all agreed to plead guilty and will collectively
pay over Dollars 8.36m (Pounds 5.57m) in fines. Four executives charged
individually also agreed to guilty pleas and face potential imprisonment and
hefty fines.
'This is the kind of international co-operation that is urgently needed in
an age of shrinking borders and international anti-trust conspiracies,' Ms

FT  10 JUN 94 / US business investment 'to rise 8.9%'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US businesses plan to increase spending on plant and equipment by 8.9 per
cent in real terms this year after an 8.6 per cent increase last year, the
Commerce Department said yesterday.
The official survey of investment intentions supports anecdotal evidence
that US business confidence has risen to the point where many companies are
planning to build new plants or extend old facilities.
Since existing capacity is largely utilised, investment in new capacity is
widely seen as a prerequisite for continued non-inflationary growth.
Yesterday's survey follows reports of a slight weakening in retail spending
and home sales in recent weeks, partly as a result of increases in short and
long-term interest rates. However, it indicates only a marginal scaling back
of capital spending plans from earlier this year, suggesting that the
tighter monetary policy is not deterring productive investment
significantly.
Rather than losing momentum, the US recovery seems to be entering a more
mature phase in which business investment and exports take up the running
from personal consumption and housing.
The survey points to encouraging inflation trends in capital goods. The
average price of plant and equipment is expected to fall by 0.6 per cent
this year. The report shows across-the-board strength in capital spending,
with declines this year in only a few sectors.
The outlook is most buoyant in manufactured durable goods, where investment
is expected to rise 10.8 per cent in cash terms this year. The strongest
industries are blast furnaces and steelworks (up 37.5 per cent from 1993),
motor vehicles (up 28.3 per cent) and electrical machinery (up 12.1 per
cent). Figures for sectors are not adjusted for inflation.
Manufacturers of non-durable goods, by contrast, are planning to increase
capital spending by only 3.7 per cent from 1993. Relatively strong sectors
include rubber (up 9.3 per cent), chemicals (7.9 per cent) and textiles (7.4
per cent.) Investment in non-manufacturing is projected to rise 8.8 per cent
this year.

FT  10 JUN 94 / Chile sees roads as route to growth: David Pilling on the
awarding of concessions to upgrade infrastructure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID PILLING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Ricardo Lagos does not believe in miracles. 'Behind the Asian miracle,
there are two principal factors,' says Chile's recently appointed public
works minister. 'A radical reform of the educational system and a
spectacular programme of infrastructure.'
The fact that infrastructure is now the responsibility of such a
high-profile minister - Mr Lagos is one of Chile's best-known politicians -
indicates the new administration's desire to follow Asia's lead by upgrading
and expanding a largely dilapidated transport network. Chile's road system
has been starved of resources for decades and has hardly altered since the
1970s, though traffic flows have quadrupled.
Mr Christopher Brown, executive director of the Chilean-British chamber of
commerce, says run-down infrastructure could start to hamper growth. Unless
action is taken, he says, 'export bottlenecks will emerge, and we just won't
be able to get the products to the boats on time'.
Chile, which has grown by an average 6 per cent a year over the past decade,
is dependent on trade, exporting nearly a third of its gross domestic
product. Mr Lagos agrees with Mr Brown's verdict. He proposes to double
annual spending on infrastructure to Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 1bn) within four
years, both to improve export competitiveness and to help the
administration's broader aims of eradicating extreme poverty.
Mr Lagos says a total of Dollars 33bn needs to be invested by 2010 and new
ways, including an ample role for private sector financing, must be found to
pay for public works.
Projects built under concession, legislation for which was approved during
the previous administration of President Patricio Aylwin, will play an
important role, he says. The first such project - the Dollars 25m El Melon
tunnel to the north of Santiago - is being built by Endesa, an energy
holding company. Mr Lagos hopes to sign concessions for road projects worth
Dollars 110m this year and for Dollars 220m in 1995.
Mr Alejandro Fernandez, head of studies at independent economics consultant
Gemines, supports concessions in theory, but says the new law is 'clumsy and
bureaucratic'.
Mr Lagos concedes that legislation is 'in need of perfection', for example
by exempting tolls from value-added tax. He does not believe, however, that
concessionaires should enjoy full ownership rights, favouring instead the
eventual transfer of projects to the state. Tasc, a Santiago-based
think-tank, has argued that this may act as a disincentive to adequate
project investment.
Mr Lagos hopes Chile will soon be able build an annual Dollars 300m-worth of
infrastructure under concession; private analysts estimate Dollars 2bn could
be raised in the next five years.
Chile's private pension funds (AFPs), now worth Dollars 17bn, are another
potential source of finance.
Legislation passed this year allows AFPs to invest part of their portfolio
in project-funding bonds and Mr Julio Bustamante, chief AFP regulator,
believes they could soon provide 40 per cent of the private infrastructure
capital. Some analysts, however, say risk-rating requirements will oblige
them to proceed more slowly.
The government also wants private sector involvement in the dilapidated
railway system, part of which is due to be privatised later this year. Ten
companies, including Renfe of Spain and Railtex of the US, have prequalified
for the sale of 51 per cent of Fepasa, the railway cargo division.
A number of Chilean forestry exporters, seeking cheap access to the coast,
are also interested.
Chile's ports, which handle nearly 95 per cent of exports, are split between
the public and private sectors. Although efficient by Latin American
standards, analysts say they fall far short of south-east Asian or European
levels. Mr Lagos says he has no ideological objection to port
privatisations, though he does not believe this should be an end in itself.
Looking to the next century, Mr Lagos shares with many other analysts a
vision of Chile as South America's gateway to Asia. 'Brazilian
industrialists in Sao Paulo would find it much cheaper to be two days' lorry
drive from Iquique or Antofagasta (northern Chilean ports) than to have to
take a boat around Cape Horn or through the Panama Canal to get to Japan or
China.'
To exploit its 3,000-mile coastline to the full, Chile would need
drastically to improve its links with Bolivia and Argentina. A tarmac road
from Arica to the Bolivian border is due to open this year and plans have
been announced for the possible construction of a sub-Andean tunnel to
Argentina.
Mr Lagos is not daunted by the task. As global trade expands and Latin
American nations such as Argentina and Brazil begin to realise their export
potential, he believes Chile will be in a unique position to act as entrepot
port. 'I am convinced that our geographical location, looking out on the
Pacific, is a resource that we have to exploit. The republic of Venice in
the 15th century had one great advantage - its location. That is Chile's
greatest asset too.'

FT  10 JUN 94 / Bosnia pressure on Clinton grows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US administration came under increasing pressure over Bosnia yesterday
when the House of Representatives voted to require the US to stop enforcing
the United Nations arms embargo against the former Yugoslavia and to supply
weapons to the Bosnian Moslem government.
The vote, by 244 to 178, does not have the force of law but will complicate
the administration's efforts in partnership with its European allies and
Russia to bring the warring parties to a peace settlement.
Congressman Lee Hamilton, chairman of the House foreign affairs committee,
warned it would merely aggravate the conflict in Bosnia.
'First of all, it's going to intensify the war,' he said, adding that the
vote would also lead to the withdrawal of UN troops, the breakdown of
humanitarian operations and the end of the peace process.
Congressman Jerrold Nadler countered that the embargo was 'the handmaid of
genocide'.
President Bill Clinton has said he favours lifting the arms embargo on
Bosnia but does not want to act unilaterally, in defiance of the wishes of
the European countries which make up the bulk of the UN peacekeeping force
in Bosnia.
Senior administration officials lobbied members yesterday morning to vote
against the measure, which they feared would complicate their efforts to
persuade the Bosnian Moslem government to accept a 'reasonable solution'.
The US has in recent weeks moved closer to the views of France and the UK on
the need to apply pressure on the Bosnian Moslems. Officials have indicated
that they would be ready to consider removing some economic sanctions
against Serbia if the Bosnian Moslem government rejected the peace proposals
on which the US is working with Europe.
Yesterday's resolution, sponsored by Congressmen Frank McCloskey of Indiana
and Benjamin Gilman of New York, requires the president to 'terminate the US
arms embargo of the government of Bosnia and Hercegovina upon receipt from
that government of a request for assistance in exercising its right of
self-defence'.
It authorises the president to provide 'appropriate military assistance' and
authorises the transfer of up to Dollars 200m (Pounds 133m) of military
equipment and training services to the Bosnian government.
Although the Senate has passed a similar resolution, its language was
different, and identical versions would have to be passed in both chambers
before the measure could become law.

defrauding Delta Airlines and Bunzl, both of which use large quantities of

FT  10 JUN 94 / European Elections (June 9 and 12): Gonzalez waits for the
judgment of Spanish - Sunday's European vote is critical for fate of
Socialist government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If the opinion polls are right, Sunday's European parliament ballot will
give the conservatives of Spain's Popular party their first victory in a
nationwide election since General Franco's death in 1975 and the restoration
of democracy. How much damage the governing Socialists sustain in the
aftermath of recent corruption affairs will crucially affect the fate of Mr
Felipe Gonzalez's government, re-elected a year ago for a fourth term.
Mr Gonzalez's vital ally, Catalonia's regional president, Mr Jordi Pujol,
has promised continued backing irrespective of who wins on Sunday - 'unless
something spectacular happens'. Mr Pujol's Convergencia i Unio party has
just enough deputies in the national parliament to make a combined majority
with the Socialists and shore up the government.
For the moment, this arrangement is convenient for Mr Pujol. He gains
leverage in Madrid, and may see the Socialists as less of a danger to him in
Catalonia while they hold power nationally than they would be in opposition.
Also, he could not easily switch allegiance to the Popular party, which has
queered its pitch in Catalonia my making a fuss over the language issue.
However, many of his party's grass-root supporters fail to understand why
they should help a discredited government in Madrid. The more the
government's credibility is undermined - either by further disclosures or by
a heavy defeat on Sunday - the more fragile this informal alliance will
become.
Opinion polls have been remarkably consistent. The Socialists, fighting for
the centre ground with both the PP and mainstream regional parties, are
generally given only about 31 per cent of the vote, compared with almost 39
per cent in last year's general election and 40 per cent in the 1989
European election. The PP comes ahead of this in all the polls, mostly in a
range of between 37 and 40 per cent, improving on its score last year of
just under 35 per cent. This would give the conservatives 26 or 27 seats
compared with the 15 they won in 1989. The Socialists would lose up to six
of their 27 seats.
The Communist-led United Left is predicted to show strong gains with up to
15 per cent of the vote.
With the same consistency, the Socialists are seen losing ground in their
stronghold region of Andalucia, where regional elections are being held on
the same day - maintaining their lead but losing their outright majority,
and therefore probably being forced to seek an alliance with the United
Left.
Mr Jose Mara Aznar, the PP leader frustrated in his bid for power last year
by a margin of 1m votes, believes his party could finish 2m votes ahead -
and within the next year win a general election.
But there are dangers in drawing too many conclusions from the polls.
Firstly, Sunday's vote cannot necessarily be translated into a likely
general election result. Many observers see it as a cost-free way for voters
to punish the government. The 'useful vote', which last year enabled the
Socialists to pick up part of the United Left's electorate to stave off a
right-wing victory, does not apply.
Secondly, pre-election polls in Spain are often misleading. Mr Fernando
Moran, the 68-year-old former foreign minister who heads the list of
Socialist candidates, says there has always been a 'hidden vote'. In
previous elections, this has involved supporters of the traditional right
who were reluctant to declare their sympathies to pollsters. This time, he
says, the same may apply to Socialist supporters.
The professorial Mr Moran, whose signature stands on Spain's 1986 European
accession treaty, leads the personal popularity stakes among the candidates.
He believes the Socialists could still end narrowly ahead but says an
advantage of one or two seats for the PP would be an 'acceptable' result.
Predictably, Socialist politicians have again conjured up the spectre of the
authoritarian right. Mr Aznar has tried to remove his reformed PP from any
associations with Francoism, which put a ceiling on the party's vote-winning
potential when it was under the leadership of Mr Manuel Fraga, former
information minister under the Franco regime. However, some close
collaborators of Mr Fraga still figure on the PP list.
A star young PP candidate, Ms Mercedes de la Merced, provided a godsend for
the other parties by speaking favourably of Franco as 'a person who cared
about the weaker classes' and who 'built a whole lot of houses for the
poor'.
Up to eight of Spain's 39 lists of candidates - almost twice the number in
France - stand a chance of returning an MEP. Less likely contenders include
the traditionalist Carlist Communion, two Falangist parties and the Spanish
branch of Hunting, Fishing, Nature and Tradition, whose candidates include a
bullfighter.
Businessman Jose Mara Ruiz-Mateos, who helped stave off trial on
falsification charges by getting elected on his own ticket last time, is
standing again. His posters show him in a hard-hat with the slogan 'Spain
for the Spaniards, work for everyone.' But the omens are not good. The
football club he bought has just been relegated to the second division.

FT  10 JUN 94 / Contented Luxembourgers look for more of the same: David
Gardner finds the prosperous Grand Duchy, one of the six founder members of

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Luxembourg comes across as a tonic for a Europe fed up with recession.
Dripping with prosperity after an almost unbroken 10-year cycle of growth,
with unemployment a quarter of the EU average, the tiny Grand Duchy,
exploiting its niche at the conjunction of France, Germany and Belgium,
outwardly looks very self-satisfied indeed.
Proud of its role as one of the six original founders of the Euro-club, its
people's commitment to Europe is not in doubt. But nor is it any longer
unquestioning.
Turnout in the June 12 elections to the European Parliament will be
deceptively high at nearly 90 per cent. As in Belgium, voting is compulsory,
and uniquely, Euro-polls coincide with national elections.
In the latter, the coalition between the Christian Socialist and Socialist
parties, in power since 1984, is expected to be returned, with a modest
bruising from the liberals of the Democratic Party, more Greens alongside
them, and perhaps a first seat for Luxembourg's small but threatening far
Right.
At European level, where Luxembourg has a generous 6 seats in Strasbourg for
its 400,000 people against, for instance, Germany's 99 seats for 81m
inhabitants, the existing configuration should also hold steady. The
Christian Socialists have three MEPs, the Socialists two, and the liberals
one - although the newly unified Greens might just win one seat.
Green MP Jup Weber, standing for Strasbourg where he already advises Green
MEPs on forestry conservation, sums up the views not only of a small party
but a small country when he says of the European Parliament that 'it is a
fantastic instrument for networking.'
But behind this placid exterior the Luxembourgers worry a bit more about
Europe's direction. 'Luxembourgers know that we need Europe, especially
after the last war,' says Mr Francois Biltgen, the Christian Socialist chief
whip. 'The question is what sort of Europe we want.'
The trauma of the second world war is scarred deeply in Luxembourg, which
suffered proportionately the highest losses on the allied side except the
Soviet Union. The post-war embrace of European integration was and is seen
as its guarantee of peace and sovereignty.
But there are now undercurrents of concern about issues such as European
citizenship and voting rights for foreigners; impact of the Single Market;
perceived threats to Luxembourg's thriving financial centre; and fears that
the EU's 1996 constitutional review could downgrade the rights of small
member states.
Maastricht allows foreigners to vote in European, and eventually, local
elections. In Luxembourg, one third of the population and half the workforce
is foreign.
The government therefore won a derogation requiring five years' residence
before eligibility to vote, and 10 years before eligibility for office. This
mostly deprived xenophobes of their market, and in practice only 6,000
foreigners have registered to vote.
In Dudelange, a neat industrial town of 16,000 near the French border, Mr
Mars di Bartolomeo, the Socialist mayor and former parliamentary chief whip
 -himself the grandson of Italian immigrants - argues that Luxembourg is a
living example of integrating Europe's peoples. 'You have the Europe of the
institutions and you have the lived, practical Europe,' he says. 'That's
what you see around you here, and we're proud of it.'
But many Luxembourgers are less enchanted with the border-free Single
Market, sold as a way of expanding into a hinterland of 10m. But bordering
areas are more down-at-heel, and it is foreign companies moving into
Luxembourg which are getting the best end of the deal, putting pressure on
the Grand Duchy's mostly small- to medium-size industries.
European harmonisation, moreover, could close the loopholes that enabled
Luxembourg to become a tax haven and satellite broadcasting centre. 'Our
partners tend to think we became rich essentially at their expense, by
exploiting loopholes,' acknowledges Paul Helminger, deputy mayor of
Luxembourg city standing for the Democrats for both parliaments. With
decisions of this magnitude increasingly taken at EU level, 'it is not
surprising that people are questioning the wisdom of dismantling the
nation-state,' Mr Helminger says.
The Democrats, traditionally the party of Europe, which provided Gaston
Thorn as Commission president in the early 1980s, have sprouted an
influential Euro-sceptical wing to reflect this. And all the main parties
are determined to preserve Luxembourg's position in the 1996 review of
power-sharing and decision-making in the Union.
'Our position is that we need Europe, but that too much Europe could be
harmful for a tiny country,' says Mr di Bartolomeo.

Private health insurance in Ireland will be opened up to competition but new
entrants will be prevented from 'cherry-picking' the low-risk sector of the
market, according to government proposals published this week. An EU
directive on non-life insurance comes into force next month, and the
proposals are intended to ensure Ireland's compliance with the directive in
the health insurance sector, by allowing other EU groups to enter the Irish
market. New entrants to the market would all have to offer a basic cover
package to all comers. Insurance companies would not be allowed to
discriminate against members opting for their schemes on the grounds of age,
sex, or health status. A non-profit making voluntary health insurance
scheme, the VHI, has operated alongside the public health service since
1957, and now has 1.3m members - over one third of the population.

The Polish government expects the country's economy to grow an average of 5
per cent a year until 1997 and inflation, now 30 per cent annually, to fall
to single figures by then, according to a plan presented to parliament
yesterday. The plan foresees unemployment falling from 16 per cent to 14 per
cent in the period. But Mr Grzegorz Kolodko, deputy premier in charge of the
economy, warned that Poland still faced major inflationary dangers as
industrial unrest affected several major enterprises. Yesterday over 20,000
workers at the giant Huta Katowice steelworks continued a nine-day-long
strike in support of wage demands while the Italian-owned Huta Lucchini
Warszawa steelworks in Warsaw saw its 2,000 employees occupy the plant to
back a 30 per cent wage rise demand. Meanwhile Over 15,000 workers at the
Fiat-owned car plant in Bielsko Biala are threatening strike action next
week.

President Boris Yeltsin's spokesman yesterday described as a 'fabrication

Victor Chernomyrdin, who is recovering from a kidney complaint.
Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper yesterday quoted 'informed sources' as saying
that Mr Yeltsin wanted to replace him with Mr Yuri Skokov (pictured left), a
presidential crony with links to the defence industry and hardline Russian
politics. This is the latest report to surface in a time-honoured method of
spreading rumours to fight political battles in Russia - and may well
reflect genuine anger by the defence lobby at the government and lower
chamber of parliament's refusal to grant it extra spending in the 1994
budget. The reports have been aggravated by a military adviser to the
Russian prime minister who was quoted as saying that Mr Chernomyrdin might
resign if extra defence spending was pushed through by the upper chamber of
parliament and the defence lobby.

FT  10 JUN 94 / Schneider slushfund claim
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A Swiss businessman has told French and Swiss newspapers that he
administered for Groupe Schneider a 'slush fund' of which Mr Didier
Pineau-Valencienne, president of the French group charged with fraud, may
have known nothing. In interviews published yesterday with Paris Match
magazine and the Nouveau Quotidien de Lausanne, Mr Luc Jacquier said he
managed a Swiss trust company called Finamines.
This was set up by the Belgian Empain group - itself later absorbed in
Schneider - to help run its mining interests in Zaire after the latter's
independence in 1960 from Belgium. Finamines in turn 'had relations with the
Panamanian holding companies of Mitraco and Tramico,' according to Mr
Jacquier, and these two companies received a considerable amount of money
from the 1960s to the mid-1980s. For tax reasons, Mr Jacquier said the
existence of Mitraco and Tramico was kept secret from shareholders of
Cofibel and Cofimines, in which Schneider had a stake. Minority shareholders
in Cofibel and Cofimines said Schneider had not given them good enough terms
in buying them out in 1992. This eventually launched the Belgian judicial
inquiry which in turn landed Mr Pineau-Valencienne in jail. Mr
Pineau-Valencienne was eventually released on FFr2.5m (Pounds 290,000) bail.
Mr Jacquier's reported comments - on which the Schneider group said
yesterday it had no comment - would appear to point the finger at Mr Jean
Verdoot, who managed Schneider's interests in Belgium until his death in an
air crash two years ago.

FT  10 JUN 94 / Swiss likely to shun peacekeeping in poll
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Swiss, who pride themselves on being the world's great peacemakers, may
be about to prohibit their soldiers from participating in United Nations
peacekeeping activities.
Polls indicate a close overall result in Sunday's referendum on whether to
allow the Swiss Army to contribute troops to the UN's blue helmet corps in
the world's trouble spots. That means the requirement for majorities to be
achieved in over half the country's 23 cantons will almost certainly not be
satisfied.
Other decisions by the Swiss in recent years to eschew international
involvement have so far produced no noticeable negative consequences for the
country. But signs exist that a No vote in this case would poison ties with
neighbouring countries.
Last week, Mr Matthias Wissmann, German transport minister, said the vote
had no direct relation to European transport talks jolted by a Swiss
referendum decision in February to prohibit all lorry transit traffic from
the Alps from 2004.
The connection was 'more atmospheric,' Mr Wissmann said. With a 'yes' vote,
Switzerland would signal it sought not only advantages from international
relations but also to carry the burdens. That message has been submerged in
a campaign where opponents are appealing to arrogance and narrow-mindedness.
Supplying blue helmet troops would compromise the country's treasured
neutrality, said Mr Christoph Blocher, the charismatic right-wing
politician-industrialist who has successfully led campaigns in recent years
to keep Switzerland out of the UN and the European Economic Area.
The fact that Sweden, Finland, Austria and other neutral countries can
reconcile their status with supplying blue helmets is brushed aside.
'Switzerland is the only long-standing armed neutral,' Mr Blocher replies.
He and other opponents charge that Swiss blue helmets would be controlled by
the UN Security Council, and thus would be creatures of the policies of the
big powers that control the council. The Swiss government insists it would
retain the power to decide on participation of Swiss troops in any given
situation.
Opponents point to the failure of the blue helmets to prevent the slaughter
in Yugoslavia, claiming they are a waste of money and an unnecessary risk to
soldiers' lives. Their advertising posters feature an illustration of
eroding Swiss soldiers' gravestones in some distant desert.
They say Switzerland already fulfils its international responsibilities by
contributing to many UN agencies and other humanitarian organisations.
The government, with wide support in parliament and business circles, agrees
Switzerland can be proud of its humanitarian efforts, but it must also share
the responsibility for the increasing need for international peacekeepers.
It says participation in the corps would be voluntary, They would not be
sent to active combat zones.

FT  10 JUN 94 / Economic Watch: Portugal's fiscal revenue rises
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Fiscal revenue in Portugal rose 26.8 per cent in the first five months of
1994, compared with the same period in 1993, to Es1,306bn (Pounds 1.07bn),
the finance ministry said yesterday. The increase of Es276.2bn is already
more than the Es240bn in tax revenue growth that the government budgeted for
the whole of 1994. A 3.9 per cent increase in government expenditure from
January to May was also well within budget, the ministry said. The revenue
rise reflects improvement in tax collection, particularly of VAT, after
virtual breakdown of the tax machine last year. Indirect taxation revenue
grew 38.9 per cent over the first five months to Es827.8bn. Control over
spending is largely attributable to a rise of only 2.5 per cent in public
administrative sector wages during the first quarter of 1994. Portugal's
budget deficit for the first five months fell 26.1 per cent, compared with
the same period last year, to Es282.2bn. Peter Wise, Lisbon
France's seasonally-adjusted industrial production index rose 0.2 per cent
in March from the previous month to an index level of 110.3, the National
Statistics Institute (INSEE) said yesterday.
Dutch consumer spending in the first quarter of 1994 showed a strong 2.8 per
cent year-on-year rise, largely due to a one-off jump in car purchases, the
Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) said yesterday.
European airlines' estimated operating losses rose fractionally in 1993 to
Dollars 2.24bn (Pounds 1.48bn) from Dollars 2.22bn in 1992, the Association
of European Airlines said.

FT  10 JUN 94 / Nato offers Russia a special relationship
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   ISTANBUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Nato yesterday held out an olive branch to Moscow by promising it a
relationship that would reflect Russia's status as the most powerful nation
in Europe.
Diplomats said the message, contained in a communique by Nato foreign
ministers and a series of verbal statements by senior Alliance figures,
should be enough to persuade Russia to join Partnership For Peace, the
military co-operation programme, in the near future.
Mr Andrei Kozyrev, Russian foreign minister, will deliver an initial
response to the initiative when he and his counterparts from other east
European nations arrive in Istanbul today.
The Nato ministers hope Mr Kozyrev will join PFP, in which 20 other eastern
central European countries have agreed to participate, in time for next
month's summit of the Group of Seven.
Ideally, the question of Nato's relations with Russia would be settled
before the European Union summit in Corfu later this month, which is
expected to set the seal on enhanced Russia-EU ties.
Mr Sergio Balzino, Nato's acting secretary-general, told the meeting:
'Russia will remain the most powerful nation in Europe; its active
participation in building a new security architecture in Europe is vital'.
The ministers called for an 'extensive and far-reaching' role for Russia
within PFP, a programme envisaging exchange of military knowhow,
co-operation over peace-keeping, and the possibility of full Nato
membership.
In a significant concession to Russian aspirations, they also called for
relations with Moscow to be developed 'in appropriate areas' outside PFP.
Diplomats said this implied acceptance of Russia's wish for an upgraded
dialogue on matters such as nuclear safety and non-proliferation.
The ministers stopped short of using the words 'special relationship' to
avoid offending Moscow's former satellite nations.
They also avoided giving any satisfaction to Russian demands for broader
institutional changes in Europe, which at their most extreme called for
Nato's subordination to the Conference on Security and Co-Operation in
Europe.
Diplomats pointed to one behind-the-scenes development which, although in
theory quite separate from yesterday's deliberations in Istanbul, should
give Moscow considerable cause for satisfaction.
Long-running talks within the CSCE on setting up a set of principles to
govern peace-keeping was making good progress and could soon yield a formal
agreement, they said.
Russia wants to secure Western acknowledgment of its 'peace-keeping' role in
the southern republics of the former Soviet Union.
The Nato ministers welcomed the announcement of a one-month ceasefire in
Bosnia and pledged to work quickly for broader agreement on the republic's
future.
Mr Alain Juppe, French foreign minister, said the contact group on Bosnia,
including the US, Russia, Britain and Germany, should within 10 days have
prepared a map providing for a territorial division of Bosnia which the
parties would be urged to accept.
'Severe pressure' would be put on any party blocking moves to a long-term
settlement.
If a settlement won general acceptance, he was confident the US would make
good on its promise to provide peacekeeping forces.

The Volkswagen/General Motors industrial espionage case couldharm relations
between the US and Germany if the Justice Department does not receive help
soon from German investigators, Mr Ron Brown, commerce secretary, suggested
yesterday.
There was no evidence of any danger to political or other business relations
at present, but 'I think it has the potential', he said in Bonn.
The risk depended on the responsiveness of the German authorities to
inquiries from the Justice Department and 'how quickly the information
flows', he added.
His remarks were the first public indication of irritation in the US
administration over the Hesse Justice Ministry's reluctance to provide
concrete help to the US authorities.
It is believed US investigators have asked for, but have been so far refused
access to, evidence accumulated by German prosecutors probing allegations
that former GM director, Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, stole
industrial secrets from the US group and took them with him when he joined
VW last year.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation started an independent probe of the
circumstances, shortly after the White House made plain that President Bill
Clinton considered industrial espionage a particular threat to US economic
interests.
Until yesterday, Justice Department and other US government officials have
consistently refused to comment on their investigation, which is believed to
be based on suspicions that GM corporate property was moved illegally across
state boundaries, in contravention of federal mail and telecommunications
laws.
Mr Brown, who met Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the Bonn economics minister, in Paris
on Wednesday was speaking after meeting US and German business and political
officials. Mr David Herman, Opel chairman, GM's German subsidiary, was among
the guests.
Mr Rexrodt was briefly embroiled in the case last year, when he was
unwillingly drawn into the fray as a potential mediator between the two
vehicle groups.
German investigators came under heavy political fire recently when Mr
Gerhard Schroder, prime minister of VW's home state Lower Saxony, called for
the case to be closed.
He suggested the investigation was biased and based partly on evidence
acquired by private detectives, hired by Opel lawyers, who used deceptive
methods.
His charges were promptly rejected by the most senior prosecuting official
in Opel's base, Hesse, who also imposed a news black-out on the probe.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Finland's plans to enter the European Union on January 1 next year could be
upset if the centre-right coalition loses a parliamentary no-confidence vote
next week, Mr Esko Aho, prime minister, said yesterday.
His comments, coming as tensions grow in the government over EU issues, were
a clear attempt to head off threats by some members of coalition parties to
vote against the government.
Finland is due to enter the EU next year along with Austria, Norway and
Sweden if the country votes to join in a referendum set for October. But Mr
Aho said that if the coalition fell, the timetable for membership would be
delayed. 'I predict this will mean Finland cannot become a member at the
same time as the other Efta (European Free Trade Area) countries that have
applied for membership,' he said.
Most observers expect the coalition will survive narrowly. But the rows over
the EU that have broken out within and between the government parties have
threatened to undermine the campaign for a Yes vote in October. Finland is
the only one of the three Nordic countries where the Yes side leads the No
camp.
The main dispute within the government is between Mr Aho's rurally-based
Centre party and the Conservative party. Mr Pertti Salolainen, the trade
minister and a key figure in Finland's accession negotiations with the EU
earlier this year, has resigned as Conservative party leader in protest at
his failure to win Centre party approval for tax cuts as a price for
Conservative approval of a FM4bn (Pounds 483m) package to help farmers
adjust to EU prices.
The anti-EU Finnish Christian party has threatened to leave the coalition
and Mr Aho's position is made more difficult by the strong current of
anti-EU feeling in his own party. He badly needs the farm support package to
help him win the official backing of the Centre party for EU membership in a
party congress on the issue due next week.
In Sweden, meanwhile, an opinion poll showed opposition to the EU slipping,
but still leading the Yes campaign. The No camp slid by 4.8 points to 40 per
cent since a similar poll last November, while support rose by 4.5 per cent
to 30.5 per cent.

The German government yesterday forecast a recovery in economic growth from
1.5 per cent this year to 2.5 per cent in 1995, and an average growth rate
of 3 per cent per year from 1995-98. Figures from the German finance
ministry suggest that in spite of a soaring debt burden, fuelled by
borrowing for unification, the country will comply by 1998 with the main
convergence criteria for European economic and monetary union.
It forecasts an inflation rate below 2 per cent in 1995, deficit spending as
a proportion of gross domestic product reduced from the current 4.5 per cent
to just 0.5 per cent by 1998, and overall government debt (in spite of a
surge to 62 per cent in 1995) falling back to 57.5 per cent of GDP by 1998.
The limit set in the Maastricht treaty for public sector debt as a
proportion of GDP is 60 per cent, and the finance ministry forecast suggests
that may only just be achieved by 1997, the first possible date for a move
to monetary union.
In five-year forecast figures submitted yesterday to the finance planning
committee, involving both federal and state governments, the finance
ministry suggests that strict spending control would reduce the current
DM69bn budget deficit to DM25bn by 1998.
The growth figures were presented by Mr Johann Eekhoff, the state secretary
in the economics ministry, who warned that, nevertheless, average
unemployment this year would rise by some 400,000 over the level of 1993,
and only be cut by some 50,000 in 1995.
The figures were sharply criticised by finance ministers from several Social
Democrat-ruled states as little more than wishful thinking. They failed to
provide adequate finances to subsidise the continuing heavy cost of
unemployment on the federal budget, and they exaggerated the likely revenues
from future privatisation plans, the ministers said.
Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister, insists that he will cut the present
budget deficit after 1995, from a level of DM69bn this year and next, to
DM60bn in 1996, DM40bn in 1997, and DM25bn in 1998. He said he could do so
by strict spending control, and not by increased taxation.
Mr Heinz Schleusser, the finance minister of North Rhine-Westphalia, said
the figures were far too optimistic. 'They are simply misleading the
public,' he said. 'Neither the states nor local authorities can plan
seriously on the basis of these figures.'
Nominal spending growth by all public bodies, including the federal
government, the 16 states, and local authorities, will be limited to just 3
per cent a year over the next five years, the finance planning committee
agreed last night.
Mr Waigel warned that the situation of public finances would remain 'very
tense' until 1998.
In particular, the figures have yet to include any allowance for the gradual
introduction of an increased basic tax threshold from 1996, as ordered by
the federal constitutional court. The court has called for the basic
tax-free allowance to provide a guaranteed subsistence level for the lowest
income-earners.

FT  10 JUN 94 / Balsam creditors face big write-offs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Bankers to Balsam, the sports-surfaces company plunged into crisis this week
after its four-man board was arrested on suspicion of fraud, believe the
bulk of their DM1.6bn (Dollars 950m) direct and indirect exposure to the
Bielefeld-based company will have to be written off.
Although the total is large, only one bank has an exposure of more than
DM100m, it emerged at the first meeting of bank creditors in Wiesbaden on
Wednesday night. This is BfG Bank, Credit Lyonnais' German subsidiary, which
has a total of DM113m at risk to Balsam and to Procedo, the factoring
company at the heart of the alleged fraud.
According to Frankfurt bankers, three banks have an exposure of DM80m -
BHF-Bank, Bayerische Vereinsbank and Landesbank Rheinland Pfalz - while
Deutsche Bank, Westdeutsche Landesbank, Norddeutsche Landesbank, Landesbank
Hessen-Thuringia and other banks each have around DM60m at risk. Dresdner
Bank and Commerzbank are believed to be owed DM50m each.
Wednesday's meeting of creditors focused primarily on the fate of Procedo,
Germany's largest factoring company. Procedo is Balsam's largest direct
creditor and banks' credit exposure to the stricken Balsam is largely
indirect, via Procedo. Talks are due to resume on Monday.
The state prosecutor in Bielefeld said earlier this week that the four
Balsam directors had been arrested on suspicion of forging documentation to
support applications for factoring agreements. Factoring companies advance
cash to their customers against the security of unpaid invoices, taking a
commission for the service provided and assuming responsibility for
collecting their customers' outstanding receivables.
The state prosecutor said the Balsam directors had over a period of years
forged letters from a US accounting firm purporting to verify the scale of
large invoices which were subsequently the subject of factoring agreements
with Procedo. The invoices were either fictitious or grossly inflated, the
Bielefeld prosecutors' office revealed, and the money raised on the invoices
was used by the company to speculate in currency and other financial
markets.
It is not yet clear how much of the money obtained by Balsam from Procedo
relates to genuine invoices, pending an investigation by an independent firm
of accountants. When discussions resume on Monday talks will focus on a
possible plan to rescue Procedo. Bankers said they hoped AKV Allgemeine
Kreditversicherung, the Mainz-based insurance company which owns 50 per cent
of Procedo, would inject cash to refinance Procedo.
The affair has raised questions about German corporate governance similar to
those provoked by the near collapse of the Metallgesellschaft industrial
group earlier this year and the failure of the Jurgen Schneider property
group.
Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank, Germany's two biggest banks, have
traditionally been close to Balsam. The two were indirect shareholders in
the company and had planned to bring it to the stock-market in the late
1980s. As in the Schneider and Metallgesellschaft cases, the close
involvement of Germany's leading financial institutions failed to prevent
the debacle. The role of the auditors to Procedo and Balsam is also likely
to come under discussion.

FT  10 JUN 94 / German telecoms sell-off in balance: Union threatens strike
after collapse of benefits talks with management
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Hopes that Germany's largest privatisation can go ahead next year hung in
the balance last night after talks between the management and unions of the
postal and telecommunications services collapsed.
The two sides broke off early yesterday after a third day of talks, trading
bitter accusations. The 570,000-strong German Postal Union (DPG) said it
would call out 11,000 workers across the country to press home its demands
that the management of the three companies guarantee workers' benefits after
privatisation.
The present state-owned postal and telecommunications leviathan, which
employs around 670,000 people, is to be broken up into three services by
January 1, 1995 according to a government plan.
However, privatisation means the government must change the constitution, an
exercise requiring a two-thirds majority in the Bundestag, or lower house of
parliament, and the support of the opposition Social Democratic party which
is close to the DPG union.
The vote must take place before June 29 if privatisation is to go ahead at
the start of next year and a number of SPD politicians have warned that
support will not be forthcoming unless management and unions can reach
agreement.
'If anyone imagines the SPD will back the change in the constitution while
strikes are going on, they have lost touch with reality,' said Mr Arne
Bornsem, the SPD telecommunications spokesman.
Management of the three companies, meanwhile, fears it will be unable to
compete internationally if saddled with a catalogue of workers' benefits
which include the right to a cold drink if the temperature rises above 26
degrees Celsius, money for new shoes worn out by postmen on letter rounds
and subsidised holidays.
'The self-appointed representatives of the workforce obviously consider cold
drinks and holidays on the Cote d'Azur more important than secure
workplaces,' said Mr Helmut Ricke, Deutsche Telekom chief executive.
Mr Rudi Vetter, a union spokesman, said the strikes would continue until the
management presented proposals 'which are negotiable'. He also dismissed
charges that the union was demanding benefits which were outdated. 'All
large enterprises offer their workforce similar benefits,' he said. 'We just
don't see why our members have to give up their benefits just so that the
companies can be floated.'
In the first stage of privatisation the government will remain the sole
shareholder. Deutsche Telekom, which will take over the telecommunications
sector, has said it wants to be floated by January 1, 1996 - the earliest
legally permissible date - in order to raise badly-needed capital.
Postdienst, the postal services, and Postbank, the banking arm, are also to
be privatised as soon as possible.
Aside from the talks between management and unions to settle the question of
benefits, parliament must decide before the end of the month how to cover
pensions payments worth about DM100bn (Pounds 40bn) after privatisation. A
further DM16bn must be found to fund future liabilities of two in-house
health insurance funds which will cease to exist.

FT  10 JUN 94 / Deal close on Madrid aid for Seat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES and DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT, MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Volkswagen and the Madrid government yesterday came close to an agreement in
negotiations over state aid for Seat, the German vehicle group's crippled
Spanish subsidiary. Further talks are scheduled next week and VW said a deal
could be expected not long after that.
According to a joint statement from Mr Ferdinand Piech, VW chairman, and Mr
Juan Manuel Eguiagaray, the Spanish industry minister, the two agreed that
there should be no direct subsidies from the Spanish government for
redundancies. Help would come instead in the form of support for
technological projects.
VW initially sought an injection of DM820m (Pounds 328m) from Spanish
central and regional authorities to cover 4,600 further job cuts at Seat,
reducing the company's workforce to 9,500. Other multinational motor
companies manufacturing in Spain reacted sharply against the prospect of
special conditions for Seat.
The statement made clear that state aid would be tied to 'certain
commitments' from VW and from Seat itself. It also underlined that an
agreement would be aimed at 'keeping the basic elements of Seat as a company
with its own capability for competing in the global market'.
The still-uncertain scale of Madrid's financial commitment is crucial to
VW's bid to plug the hole in VW group finances threatening for the second
year in succession to sink hopes of breaking even. Seat lost DM1.8bn in
1993, was DM350m in the red in the first quarter of this year, and is
heading for a further full-year deficit of DM1bn, according to company
officials.
VW has taken control of Seat's Pamplona factory and financial services
division. The Zona Franca plant in Barcelona - subject of the current
negotiations - is to be closed, leaving Seat with just one works, a new
plant at Martorell.

FT  10 JUN 94 / Turkish TV companies put future in the frame: A new
licensing system is set to shape the industry for the next decade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Turkey's television industry is on best behaviour, with companies today
making initial applications to the newly formed High Broadcasting Council
for licences the allocations of which will shape the industry for the coming
decade.
Invitations to tender will be announced in August and will be awaited with
interest by both domestic and foreign investors in what has been one of the
country's most dynamic sectors.
The current economic troubles, with the lira having lost 50 per cent of its
value against the dollar, have dampened investor enthusiasm throughout the
economy. But in the new broadcasting regime - legislation for which was
passed in April - under which the council is likely to limit the number of
licences, there are expected to be fewer companies competing for the same
amount of advertising revenues. This will strengthen the finances of
companies operating in the sector.
What is more, with the launch of Turkey's own satellite later this year and
the planned privatisation of the state telecom company - which will open the
way for innovations such as video on demand - the opportunities are huge.
Some in the industry wonder whether the new legislation will keep pace with
the changes in technology. Mr Nuri Colakoglu, head of Show, the largest
private station, says the law set out to 'create a still picture, when in
fact what they were seeing was the frame of a moving film'.
The legislation provides a timely measure of official thinking on a range of
vexed issues, from the Kurdish rebellion, the role of religious broadcasting
in a Moslem country with a devoutly secular constitution, and the challenge
to the state posed by the accumulation of media power, as well as the
technological challenge.
'It's as good as the French or German legislation,' says Sedat Orsel,
formerly deputy director of state television, now head of Eko television, a
pay channel in which Koc Holding, Turkey's largest manufacturing company is
in collaboration with Canal-Plus and Time Warner.
However the issue of Kurdish-language broadcasts, once mooted by the prime
minister, Mrs Tansu Ciller, as a way to win over moderate Kurds, has been
left for another day. After criticism from right-wingers such as her own
True Path party deputy Mr Coskun Kirca, the final draft stipulated only the
use of foreign languages 'which have contributed to the universal cultural
and scientific works' - a phrase which Kurdish nationalists will take as
doubly wounding.
Politicians such as Mr Ulus Gurkan, a member of the parliamentary drafting
commission, complain that the law is too restrictive, particularly the
powers it gives the prime minister to stop broadcasts deemed against the
'public interest'.
But many officials concede the companies brought it on themselves. In a
conservative society, much of the programming has often stretched the bounds
of public tolerance.
A lot is at stake for the television companies, not least an advertising
market worth Dollars 300m in 1993 and the chance to beam to a growing and
young population where consumer choice is just taking off.
The new law is broadly in line with other European practice in areas such as
cross shareholding, advertising restrictions and broader public morality
issues such as violence and pornography.
Foreign equity will be limited to 20 per cent. The legislation will
rationalise the number of terrestrial channels. The council will be
entrusted to draft rules for cable and satellite transmission. The
re-transmission of foreign programmes will no longer be allowed, with a
waiver for one-off events such as foreign football matches.
Turkish companies advertising on foreign satellite channels will not be able
to set off their advertising costs against tax. Cost - in this case, of the
satellite dish - is seen as the best constraint on the growth of foreign
broadcasts.
The big companies have complained that the rules on ownership are too
onerous. But Mr Gurkan says 'the restrictions are essential if Turkey is to
have a free press'.

FT  10 JUN 94 / New row in prospect over EU recycling proposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LUXEMBOURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The 18-month row over the anarchy in Europe's divergent regulations for
recycling waste packaging is threatening to reignite following a new block
yesterday on a common European Union law which should already have been
agreed.
The long-stalled waste packaging directive was agreed in principle last
December, against German, Dutch and Danish objections that its targets for
the recovery and recycling of packaging were not stringent enough.
Passage of the directive is a litmus test of the Twelve's ability to
reconcile their environmental ambitions without distorting competition in
the single market.
A year ago, France threatened to ban imports of German packaging waste, and
six other states complained their own recycling industries were being buried
under the volume of waste Germany was sending to its neighbours for
processing.
Before this, Germany, tired of waiting for legislation at EU level, had set
itself ambitious recycling targets it did not, and still does not, have the
installed capacity to meet. Furthermore, it has undercut its partners by
subsidising the waste it exports. The UK complained last year that its
imports of plastic waste had rocketed by 450 per cent in 1992 against the
previous year, entering in some cases with German subsidies of Pounds 200
per tonne.
Although last December's deal was brokered by the Belgian EU presidency, it
is, ironically, Belgium which has now gone over to the German side. Along
with the Netherlands and Denmark, it constituted a blocking minority at a
meeting in Luxembourg of EU environment ministers which the 'green' northern
trio could not muster on their own.
If Belgium cannot be budged in negotiations at senior official level in the
next few days, lengthy negotiations with the new European parliament have to
begin. Moreover, from July when Germany assumes the EU presidency, it would
fall to Mr Klaus Topfer - Bonn's environment minister and unrepentant
architect of the stricter and contested German legislation - to act as
conciliator.
The targets Mr Topfer thinks too low require a minimum of 50 per cent and
maximum of 65 per cent of packaging waste to be recovered within five years
of the directive coming into effect. Within that, a minimum of 25 per cent
and maximum of 45 per cent would have to be recycled.
The centre of the new row is a new two-part amendment from the European
parliament saying that
the EU can use 'economic instruments' (including taxes) to further the
recycling effort, but that these should not distort competition or the free
movement of goods.
The caveat worries the Belgians. High waste packaging recycling standards
and 'green' taxes put in place in the past few years by the Flemish regional
authorities could face legal challenge Belgium fears, even though a
little-tested EU treaty article does allow higher standards on public health
and environmental grounds even when there are competition side-effects.
Belgium believes it needs to register its opposition now, to stand a chance
in the European Court later if the Flemish standards are ever challenged.
The fact that the parliament's amendments include possible fiscal
intervention in recycling (including tax incentives) has also worried the UK
government, which is firmly opposed to EU-wide taxes on the environment.

FT  10 JUN 94 / World News in Brief: German court clears IRA suspects of
soldier's murder
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A German court acquitted three suspected IRA terrorists of murdering a
British army officer but said it was convinced they were IRA members. Paul
Hughes, 30, Donna Maguire, 27, and Sean Hick, 33, had been charged with the
1990 shooting of Major Michael Dillon-Lee in Dortmund. The presiding judge
said the trio were part of an IRA 'active service unit' on the European
mainland, but this itself was not a crime in Germany. They were also
acquitted for lack of evidence of attempted murder charges in the failed
1990 bombing of British army barracks at Langen Hagen, when a sentry
disturbed armed attackers trying to prime some 100 pounds of Semtex
explosives.

FT  10 JUN 94 / Honda plans 50% expansion of UK carmaking capacity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Honda is poised to announce a significant expansion of its UK car
manufacturing operations, which could increase capacity by up to 50 per
cent.
The planned expansion of its UK plant, on a 370-acre site at Swindon in
south-west England, forms part of a revised Honda strategy for Europe in the
wake of German carmaker BMW's takeover of Honda's British partner, Rover
Group.
Under this strategy, Honda will also sharply step up its marketing
activities in Europe and increase the size of its European dealership
network by about one-half between now and the end of the decade. At present
it has 1,700 dealers.
The Swindon facilities, in which Honda has invested Pounds 370m so far, have
a declared capacity of 100,000 cars a year, which is due to be reached next
year.
Last year Honda produced 32,139 cars and 116,035 engines at the Swindon
plant. Output is forecast to rise to 50,000 cars and 150,000 engines this
year, with car production set to reach 100,000 in 1995.
Under the new strategy Honda is expected to move to substantially higher
output well before the end of the decade, with the prospect of considerably
higher employment at the Swindon plant than has been indicated to date.
Currently the plant employs 1,400 people, with a further 600 to be be added
by the time output reaches the 100,000 a year mark. The intention to expand
is understood to predate British Aerospace's decision earlier this year to
sell Rover Group to BMW.
Initially the deal provoked a furious response from Honda. However, while
Rover and Honda are selling back the shareholdings they took in each other,
Honda has agreed to continue existing collaboration agreements.
Those include replacements for the Rover 200/400 series and their Honda
equivalent, the Concerto, which Rover has been building for Honda at Rover's
plant at Longbridge, Birmingham.
The replacements - code-named Theta by Rover and HH by Honda - are due to go
on sale early next year. But under arrangements already agreed before the
BMW takeover, Rover is to build only the Rover-badged versions at
Longbridge, while Honda is to build the HH - expected to be called the Civic
 -itself at Swindon.

FT  10 JUN 94 / Bonn casts doubt on monetary union timetable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH, European Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the German economics minister, yesterday appeared to cast
doubt on the Maastricht timetable for economic and monetary union by saying
that a single European currency might take until 2001 to realise.
Speaking in London, Mr Rexrodt stressed that individual European economies
had to show 'more convergence' before Emu would be feasible.
'From the German side, we are keeping the goal of a common currency. But we
will not get excited if it takes five, six or seven years,' he said.
The Maastricht treaty lays down 1997 and 1999 as the earliest and latest
possible dates for introduction of Emu. Mr Rexrodt made clear his overall
commitment to monetary union. 'We have to go that way - there is no
alternative.'
Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank president, have
both emphasised recently that maintaining currency stability is more
important than sticking rigidly to the Maastricht timetable. However, Mr
Rexrodt is the first senior member of the German economic policy
establishment to say publicly that Emu could be delayed until the next
century. He made the comments at a conference on investment in Germany
organised by the German-British Chamber of Commerce.
Both Mr Rexrodt and Mr Michael Heseltine, the UK trade and industry
secretary, who also spoke at the conference, underlined the importance of
further measures to free European businesses from unnecessary regulation.
However, the two ministers admitted that Britain and Germany had made little
progress on setting up an Anglo-German panel of business experts to review
EU legislation. The initiative was announced when the two ministers met in
London on April 27, but Mr Rexrodt said the two sides were still exploring
the 'structure' of such a body.
Mr Heseltine said the delay was partly due to the intervening six weeks of
campaigning for the European elections.
Mr Rexrodt painted a relatively optimistic picture of German economic
recovery. The 1994 growth rate could top the official target of 1.5 per cent
and expansion next year could be around 2 per cent.
The two ministers showed divergence on the importance of the European social
chapter, from which the UK won an opt-out in the Maastricht treaty.
Mr Heseltine claimed that Britain was attracting investment from Germany
partly because German companies were trying to free themselves from onerous
EU social legislation.
Mr Rexrodt said the problem of German labour costs and social policy
rigidities was not linked to the social chapter. 'Our problems concern a
social system that has become too complicated and extensive and is also
misused,' he said.

FT  10 JUN 94 / Tories braced for poll rout: Mass abstentions on European
vote - 60 per cent turnout in Eastleigh
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Conservative party was bracing itself for electoral disaster last night
as a low turnout in the European elections and five by-elections signalled
mass abstentions by core Tory voters.
About 60 per cent of eligible voters were believed to have gone to the polls
in Eastleigh, the Hampshire seat held by the late Mr Stephen Milligan,
suggesting that Liberal Democrats were virtually certain to over-turn the
Conservative majority of more than 17,000.
Polling was also slow in the election for 84 members of an expanded European
parliament, underlining the possibility that the Tories lose up to two
thirds of their 32 seats, with up to a dozen going to the Liberal Democrats
and the rest to Labour.
Turnout was reported to be low in The Netherlands, where exit polls
suggested that the Christian Democrats would gain one seat. Voters in
Ireland and Denmark also went to the polls yesterday. Elections for the
expanded 567 seat will take place in the other eight EU countries Sunday.
In London, Conservative managers believe that a late swing to the party
could allow it to hold up to 20 seats, which would be regarded by many
activists as a triumph for Mr John Major, the prime minister.
However, the latest opinion poll, by Mori for The Times, indicated that the
party could be left with as few as four seats. The poll gave the
Conservatives 23 per cent of the vote, compared with 51 per cent for Labour,
and 20 per cent for the Liberal Democrats.
Such a result would expose Mr Major to renewed criticism from right-wing
MPs, in spite of his generally Euro-sceptic approach during the campaign. It
would also resuscitate talk of a challenge to Mr Major's leadership of the
Conservative party in the autumn.
Mr Major, who spent most of the day at Downing Street, made no comment on
the elections, which he has said will have no impact on his determination to
serve a full his five-year term in office.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, voted early in Yeovil, in his
constituency. Mrs Margaret Beckett, the acting Labour leader, also voted
early in her constituency in Derby.
The Liberal Democrats were hoping to dislodge the Conservatives from second
place in one or more of four by-elections in the Labour held seats of
Barking, Dagenham, Newham NE and Rotherham.
However, the party was scaling back its hopes in all five by-election
constituencies because of embarrassment over the last minute defection to
Labour of Mr Alec Kellaway, the party's candidate in Newham.
Officials said Mr Kellaway's defection had had a substantial impact in
Eastleigh.
Mr John Braggins, the Labour agent, said the party was hopeful of taking
second place. 'Our workers are very buoyant. In our areas voters are coming
out more strongly than it other areas,' he said.

<TEXT>
Mr Ronald Brown, the US secretary of commerce, yesterday defended the
aggressive export promotion stance of the US administration and promised to
continue vigorous lobbying for US companies seeking international contracts,
writes Quentin Peel in Dusseldorf. He said the recent US success in winning
two multi-billion-dollar aerospace and telecommunications contracts in Saudi
Arabia was proof that the policy was effective.
Mr Brown yesterday re-opened the US consulate general in Dusseldorf and said
this was part of a push to raise US exposure in Germany, and support
exports, particularly of medium-sized US companies. Earlier, he had talks
with Mr Wolfgang Botsch, the German minister for posts and
telecommunications, and urged rapid liberalisation of the German telecoms
market to give US suppliers greater access.

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US is targeting Japanese overseas development aid as another channel for
increasing US exports, according to a top US trade official.
In a break from conventional US trade policy, the Commerce Department is
'looking into how US firms can get a larger share of (Japan's aid)
financing', Mr Jeffrey Garten, under-secretary of commerce for international
trade, said yesterday.
Japanese overseas development aid, much of which goes into infrastructure
investment, amounts to about Dollars 10bn a year, he said.
Of that, Japanese companies win about 30 per cent of contracts while US
companies were receiving only about 5 per cent, according to Commerce
Department estimates. 'We have to take another look at who is receiving
what,' Mr Garten noted. While no target is being discussed for the US share
of Japan's ODA allocation, Mr Garten went on to say that 'we think there is
great room for US firms to expand their share'.
He also underlined that Japanese aid was untied and that the task facing US
authorities was to spread information on Japanese ODA among US companies and
on how to go about winning contracts. 'Many, many US firms don't even know
of the existence of this money,' Mr Garten said.
Competition to win contracts involving Japanese aid would most certainly
intensify, particularly from Europe.
Separately, Mr Garten also emphasised US interest in increasing exports to
Japan in the field of information technology, where the US has a leading
edge.

<TEXT>
Swiss voters are likely to be asked in the next four years whether their
government should discuss membership of the European Union, Reuter reports
from Berne.
A statement from the Federal Chancellery yesterday said 101,337 legal
signatures - more than the required minimum of 100,000 - had backed a
proposal for a referendum on the issue.
Unless the proposal is withdrawn, the government is now obliged to hold a
vote before January 20, 1998.
Proponents of a referendum want the Swiss government to break off all
negotiations with the European Union on future membership and begin
discussions only with explicit approval of voters.
The proposal was launched by members of the right-wing political parties
Swiss Democrats and the League of Ticino.
Switzerland voted in December 1992 to reject membership of the European
Economic Area, but the Berne government continues to support EU membership.

FT  10 JUN 94 / VW close to deal with Madrid on aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES and DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT, MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Volkswagen and the Madrid government yesterday came close to an agreement in
negotiations over state aid for Seat, the German vehicle group's crippled
Spanish subsidiary.
Further talks are scheduled next week and VW said a deal could be expected
not long after that.
According to a joint statement from Mr Ferdinand Piech, VW chairman, and Mr
Juan Manuel Eguiagaray, the Spanish industry minister, the two agreed that
there should be no direct subsidies from the Spanish government for
redundancies. Help would come instead in the form of support for
technological projects.
VW initially sought an injection of Dm820m (Pounds 328m) from Spanish
central and regional authorities to cover 4,600 further job cuts at Seat,
reducing the company's workforce to 9,500. Other multinational motor
companies manufacturing in Spain reacted sharply against the prospect of
special conditions for Seat.
The statement made clear that state aid would be tied to 'certain
commitments' from VW and from Seat itself. It also said an agreement would
be aimed at 'keeping the basic elements of Seat as a company with its own
capability for competing in the global market'.
The uncertain scale of Madrid's financial commitment is crucial to VW's bid
to plug the hole in VW group finances which is threatening for the second
year in succession to sink hopes of breaking even.
Seat lost DM1.8bn (Pounds 720m) in 1993, was DM350m in the red in the first
quarter of this year, and is heading for a further full-year deficit of
DM1bn, according to company officials. The result would be even worse if VW
had to bear the full restructuring costs.
Yesterday's talks were also attended by mr Gerhard Schroder premier of the
state of Lower Saxony, which is VW's main shareholder, and senior officials
of Catalonia's regional government. The two-hour meeting marked the start of
substantive negotiations following a bout of shadow-boxing interspersed with
implicit and explicit threats from VW.
These ranged from veiled hints that Seat might be declared insolvent, to
clearer warnings that the company could lose its independence. Since the
unexpected discovery of last year's losses and the sacking of the former
chairman last September, Seat has already lost much of its independence.
In return for emergency cash injections, Volkswagen has taken control of
Seat's Pamplona factory and financial services division. The Zona Franca
plant in Barcelona - subject of the current negotiations - is to be closed,
leaving Seat with just one works, a new plant at Martorell.
More recently VW has suggested that research and design might be taken over
by the German parent, effectively leaving Seat stripped down to a
manufacturing and distribution operation.
Last month German executives with close links to Mr Piech were installed in
central board and management positions, although Spaniard Mr Joan Llorens
remained as chairman.
Yesterday's progress followed encouraging hints from Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the
Spanish prime minister, after he discussed the issue at a meeting last
weekend with Chancellor Helmut Kohl. Spain was prepared to accept 'certain
responsibilities,' Mr Gonzalez said.

FT  10 JUN 94 / Record low Netherlands turnout in Euro-poll: UK
Conservatives fear disaster - Dutch Christian Democrats hope to gain lead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Elections to the European Parliament began yesterday with a record low
turnout in the Netherlands and the ruling Conservative party in the UK
bracing itself for disaster.
In the Netherlands, traditionally one of the most pro-European electorates
in the EU, voter turnout slumped to 35 per cent, indicating that the
Christian Democrats of outgoing prime minister Mr Ruud Lubbers had recovered
the lead they lost in a general election last month.
Early exit polls in Denmark suggested no change in the overall balance
between pro- and anti-Europeans. Voting was stronger than expected, with a
turnout of 52 per cent compared with 46.2 per cent in 1989.
In Ireland, polling was slow through the day and a turnout of between 40 and
50 per cent of the country's 2.6m voters was expected. This would compare
with a 48 per cent turnout in the 1984 European election, and a 68 per cent
turnout in 1989, the latter coinciding with a general election.
Elections for the expanded 567-seat parliament will take place in the other
eight EU countries on Sunday. Official results are not due to be published
until Sunday night.
Preliminary forecasts by Dutch television showed that the Christian
Democrats stood to win 10 seats in the European Parliament, two seats ahead
of Labour, which is now the largest party in the national parliament.
For both the Christian Democrats and Labour, the results would be no
different from 1989, but would indicate a relative decline as the Dutch will
have six more seats in the parliament, for a total of 31.
The low Dutch turnout compared badly with the 47 per cent at the last
European election in 1989. Exit polls suggested D66, a left-of-centre party,
would win four seats - three more than it gained five years ago. The
Liberals seemed set to capture six seats, an increase of three. Direct
comparison between the 1989 and 1994 elections is complicated by the
expansion in the number of Dutch seats.
A low turnout traditionally helps the Christian Democrats and hurts Labour.
Another factor in favour of the Democrats may have been the appeal to voters
by Mr Lubbers, who is fighting an uphill battle to become president of the
European Commission.
In Denmark, the strongly pro-union Liberal Party, led by Mr Uffe
Ellemann-Jensen, the former foreign minister, stood to add one seat to win
four of Denmark's 16 seats, according to one exit poll.
Other polls indicated a strong performance by anti-European movements, the
People's Movement against the EU and the June Movement. However, the
anti-Europeans, although expected to increase their vote to about 25 per
cent from 18.9 per cent, were not expected to add to the four seats they
already hold.
The Social Democratic party, which dominates the present government
coalition, was expected to lose one of its four seats. Its share of the vote
appeared to have fallen to about 15 per cent from 23.3 per cent. Mr Poul
Nyrup Rasmussen, the prime minister, said it was 'a clearly disappointing
result'.
In the UK, polling was also slow in the election for 84 MEPs, increasing the
prospect that the Tories will lose up to two-thirds of their 32 seats, with
up to a dozen going to the Liberal Democrats and the rest to Labour.
However, Conservative managers believe that a late swing to the party could
allow it to hold up to 20 seats, which would be regarded by many activists
as a triumph for Mr John Major, the prime minister.
However, the latest opinion poll carried out by Mori for The Times indicated
that the party could be left with as few as four seats. The poll gave the
Conservatives just 23 per cent of the vote, compared with 51 per cent for
Labour and 20 per cent for the Liberal Democrats.
Such a result would expose Mr Major to renewed criticism from rightwing
Eurosceptic MPs, in spite of his generally Eurosceptic approach during the
campaign.

FT  10 JUN 94 / Salinas may stand as world trade chief
</HEADLINE>

President Carlos Salinas of Mexico is considering competing to be head of
the World Trade Organisation, which is to succeed the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade next year.
A spokesman for Mr Salinas said yesterday: 'The foreign ministry has
recognised the pronouncements in favour of President Salinas, and is
exploring to see whether there is a consensus for his candidacy. This does
not imply a decision has been taken.'
The Mexican government is understood to have taken soundings at senior level
in the US State Department and the office of President Bill Clinton's trade
representative about how Washington would respond if Mr Salinas stood.
If he did, he would be the most heavyweight political figure yet to enter
the contest. The two declared candidates so far are Mr Renato Ruggiero, an
Italian former trade minister, and Mr Rubens Ricupero, Brazil's finance
minister.
However, Mr Salinas' entry might divide political opinion in Latin America
and upset the Brazilian government.
President Salinas is obliged to stand down as Mexican president at the end
of his six-year term in December, when he would be free to assume the WTO
post. However, for domestic political reasons, he cannot be seen to campaign
too openly for the job before the presidential election in late August.
The decision on the WTO leadership is expected to be taken in late autumn,
after consultation among Gatt's members.
As leader of an important emerging economy, who has strongly espoused
liberalisation and reform, Mr Salinas would be likely to exercise wide
appeal. Although Gatt has been headed until now by Europeans, most of its
members are developing countries which would like the WTO to be headed by
one of their own.
Mr Salinas' interest in the WTO post also seems likely to be viewed
sympathetically by the Clinton administration.
However, support from Washington might prove a mixed blessing.
There has long been speculation that Mr Salinas, who is 46, would seek a
senior international post after leaving the presidency.
He also appeared to attract some support from Mr Pedro Solbes, Spain's
finance minister.
In practice, however, the Spanish government is likely to go along with the
choice of other European Union governments, since it wants their support for
the candidacy of Mr Enrique Baron, former speaker of the European
Parliament, as secretary-general of the European Union.
At present, Mr Ruggiero is clear favourite as the EU candidate for the WTO
post.

FT  09 JUN 94 / International Company News: Skanska acquisitions double US
presence

<TEXT>
Skanska, the Swedish construction and real estate group, has acquired Beers
Construction Company, a leading building company in the south-east US, and
CPI, a technical company based near New York. The acquisitions will double
the size of Skanska's US operations.
The announcement comes within a week of a declaration by Mr Melker
Schorling, chief executive, that Skanska intended to increase its
non-Swedish operations to about 40 per cent of group revenue following a
slump in its home market which led to losses in 1992. Last year, foreign
business accounted for 23 per cent of the group's SKr28.9bn (Dollars 3.7bn)
sales.
Skanska did not disclose the price of Beers and CPI.
'Skanska is already a market leader in the New York area,' Mr Schorling
said. 'With the acquisition of Beers we now hold a similar position in the
growth areas of the south-east. By purchasing CPI we are simultaneously
supplementing our resources with increased technical competence, making us a
full-service organisation in the US.'
Beers specialises in building hospitals, schools, industrial buildings and
sports facilities.

FT  09 JUN 94 / International Company News: Swedish insurer turns in 15%
rise

Trygg-Hansa SPP, the Swedish insurer, recorded a SKr600m (Dollars 75.9m)
operating profit in the first four months of the year, up 15 per cent from a
year ago.
The performance continues the 1993 recovery, when the group achieved a
SKr1.72bn operating profit after a SKr5.2bn deficit a year earlier.
However, the group sustained heavy losses after investing in Gota AB, two
collapsed credit insurers, and Home Holdings, the US insurance group.
Perstorp, the Swedish speciality chemicals and plastics group, advanced 83
per cent in the eight months to April 1994. Profits after financial items
rose to SKr385m (Dollars 48.7m) from SKr210m in the same period a year ago,
writes Hugh Carnegy in Stockholm.
The company said it expected full-year profits to reach SKr500m-SKr550m, an
improvement of about 70 per cent over its last September-August fiscal year.
The large profits increase was achieved despite a comparatively modest 18
per cent rise in sales to SKr6.76bn, compared with SKr5.7bn.
Perstorp said it had been hit by increases in raw material prices which it
had been unable to pass on. Nevertheless, rationalisation during the
previous year had yielded higher margins which, combined with penetration of
new markets and the introduction of products, had boosted profits.
Perstorp said its three biggest divisions - surface materials, components
and speciality chemicals - had achieved the biggest sales and earnings
increases in the company.
It added that its Biotec division had opened sales offices in the Ukraine
and China where the big agriculture industries offered attractive markets.

FT  09 JUN 94 / Nepal dam plan a ticket to development - or waste of money:
A look at a Dollars 770m hydro power project due for World Bank decision
soon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The World Bank is due next month to decide whether to fund a controversial
Dollars 770m (Pounds 513m) hydroelectric dam in Nepal after eight years of
debate involving the bank, the Nepalese government and the project's
increasingly vocal critics.
Bank and government officials believe the scheme will help put one of the
world's 10 poorest countries on to the path of economic modernisation by
exploiting water, its most valuable resource.
Opponents say the project, Nepal's biggest investment, is too big and too
expensive. They say the country should first tackle other smaller schemes
before investing the equivalent of more than the government's annual budget
on a single dam on the Arun river in northern Nepal. The opposition is led
by about 30 Nepalese, US, and European non-government development
organisations, which are orchestrating campaigns in Kathmandu and in
Washington.
World bank officials concede that, even though about 80 per cent of costs
will be covered by foreign aid grants, the Arun project could strain Nepal's
fragile public finances unless the government carries out a comprehensive
financial overhaul. But they say the government has already started the
overhaul, so the risk is worth taking.
The bank is promoting the project at a time of growing international concern
about evidence that big dams in developing countries often do not deliver
expected economic benefits and sometimes cause unexpected problems.
The Arun dam is to be built in a remote, rocky and sparsely populated
valley. Only about 150 families will be displaced. Local people mostly want
the dam because a 70-mile access road to be built along the valley will
connect its 450,000 inhabitants to the outside world.
Environmental concerns are not central to the argument either: the dam will
be wedged into the river bed and only a small lake will be created behind it
since the normal flow of the river will be sufficient to power the turbines.
The debate centres on economics. The Nepalese government first considered
the project in the mid-1980s and reviewed it after the overthrow of the
country's royalist administration and the establishment of democratic rule
in 1991. Early proposals for a multi-dam 1,100MW scheme were shelved in
favour of one dam with a capacity of 201MW - to be followed by a second
201MW dam later. The first dam alone will produce almost as much power as
Nepal's existing generating stations which have a capacity of just 230MW.
The government argues that Nepal must be bold if it is ever to ease its
power shortages. Only 10 per cent of the 19m population now has electricity,
and even they suffer frequent cuts. The country cannot neglect the value of
its 42,000MW of potential hydroelectric generating capacity. With the help
of the Arun project, Nepal can think of modern industries. 'Arun is our
ticket to sustainable development,' says Mr Binayak Bhadra, a member of the
government's National Planning Commission.
The critics charge that the Arun project is expensive since it costs Dollars
3.8m per megawatt of installed capacity, compared with Dollars 2.5m and less
for smaller schemes. They add that because of the time needed to build the
road, the Arun project will not produce electricity for at least eight
years, so other schemes are needed now. These include village-level
micro-dams, medium-sized dams for towns and at least one large project - a
Dollars 300m, 140MW project on the river Kaligandaki in central Nepal.
Kaligandaki is more suitable for Nepal than Arun, say the critics, because
it will cost only about Dollars 2.5m per megawatt of capacity and will be
built faster because a road is already in place.
The World Bank argues the Arun project is not expensive because the
Kaligandaki river flows strongly for only four months a year whereas the
Arun river flows at full force almost all year, so the dam's capacity would
be more fully used.
The opponents say donor countries, including Germany and Japan, which are
making large bilateral aid contributions to the Arun project, are mostly
interested in generating business for their own industries. Mr Bikesh
Pandey, Nepal representative of Intermediate Technology, a British
non-government organisation, says: 'We are being railroaded by the donors.'
In a limited-circulation report on Nepal completed in March, World Bank
officials acknowledge there are dangers. They say the successful financial
management of the Arun project depends on the government continuing the
economic reforms started in 1991, including raising tax revenues, cutting
non-productive spending and further increasing electricity charges to reduce
power subsidies.
Otherwise, says the Bank, education and health care will suffer.
'Implementing the Arun scheme without substantive fiscal reforms would
seriously undermine human resource development and broad-based growth and
development.'

The UK, Ireland, Denmark and the Netherlands go to the polls today, opening
the continent-wide voting for the European parliament. Balloting in the
eight other EU states - Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg,
Portugal and Spain - takes place on Sunday. The elections will also be seen
as a popularity test for some national governments. The UK's Conservative
government led by John Major is under most pressure, expected to lose about
a third of its 32 seats in Europe. EU poll issues, Page 2; Editorial

FT  09 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Lasmo poised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, CHRISTINE BUCKLEY and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Enterprise Oil bid for Lasmo entered a crucial phase as the market
braced itself for Lasmo's final defence document, expected possibly today,
which will include a net asset valuation by independent oil consultants
DeGolyer and MacNaughtoin.
Dealers said the market indicated Enterprise's bid would fail, hence the
rise in Enterprise shares, which rallied 12 to 391p on keen turnover of 1m.
Lasmo, meanwhile, hardened 1 1/2 to 137p with turnover increasing
significantly to reach 5.5m shares.
The latest fall in crude oil prices, to below the Dollars 16 a barrel mark,
unsettled the oil sector, where British Petroleum slipped 3 to 377p in heavy
turnover of 9.4m shares and Shell Transport eased a penny to 698p on 4.9m
traded.
Oil analysts were not unduly bearish of the oil sector. 'Most of the
downside pressure has already been exerted,' commented one.
Standard Chartered continued to outpace the rest of the banks sector, with
the market chasing the shares higher again ahead of a series of US
presentations from Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank. At the close
Standard shares were 9 higher at 271p after exceptionally heavy volume of
7.7m.
News from the court hearing on the Lloyds Bank merger with the Cheltenham &amp;
Glouc-ester Building Society was not known during market hours. Lloyds ended
7 firmer at 571p, with marketmakers saying a rejection of the proposed
merger could lead to severe downside pressure on Lloyds shares.
Abbey National, up 11 at 428p at the close and whose shares were badly
affected by the Lloyds/C&amp;G merger prosposals as the market focused on
increased competition in the mortgage market, was expected to rise sharply
in the event that the merger was blocked. TSB advanced 9 to 219p as a number
of short market positions were squeezed.
Preliminary figures from Hambros, the merchant bank, were initially well
received and in line with market forecasts but Hambros shares, which touched
317p immediately following the results, subsequently dipped to close 8 down
at 305p as institutions switched into SG Warburg. The latter raced up 14 to
729p. Kleinwort Benson shares were unaffected and edged up 3 to 458p.
London International Group fell 8 1/2 to 90 1/2 p as the company announced
pre-tax losses of Pounds 174.9m and a one-for-one rights issue.
The rights issue, which is at a price of 70p, had been well-flagged and the
market had been braced for the figures.
Although the share price receded there was some optimism surrounding the
stock, sparked by the belief that the company was finally putting its
troubles behind it and had turned a corner. 'There are good prospects for
recovery; there is the feeling that this year has been a watershed for LIG,'
said Mr Nigel Barnes at Hoare Govett. Turnover was above average at 2.5m
shares.
A settlement of Pounds 115m in the proceedings brought by helicopter group
Westland against the Arab Organisation for Industrialisation in France
helped Westland's parent GKN rise 12 to 603p. Volume in the stock - which is
to be included in the FT-SE 100 as a replacement for Tarmac - was 2.4m.
Results in line with market expectations saw Northern Foods gain 4 at 212p.
Pre-tax profits for the year ended March 31 increased to Pounds 157.2m,
compared with Pounds 153.2m a year ago. Food manufacturing analysts
downgraded their forecasts for the current year, mainly because of
restructuring provisions.
Dealers said BZW had joined Strauss and Warburg in recommending Cadbury
Schweppes, which scored a sharp rise of 15 to 472p on turnover of 2.6m.
There was improved business in the food retailers, with J. Sainsbury rising
9 to 393p on 4m traded, still boosted by the Yamaichi recommendation, and
Argyll ahead 3 at 236p on 5m. Kwik Save climbed 12 to 554p and Iceland rose
5 to 143p.
The stores sector was largely subdued, with dealers reporting little buying
activity.
However, MFI, the furniture group, was helped by a UBS buy recommendation,
gaining 2 at 158p. Boots was said to have been given a push by Smith New
Court, the stock moving ahead 10 to 533p.
WH Smith saw its recent run come to an end as the 'A' shares drifted back 3
to 494p. Similarly, Kingfisher's recent bounce lost momentum and the stock
retreated 2 to 528p.
A recommended offer for Chiltern Radio, at 242p a share, sent the stock
leaping 33 to 238p. Metro Radio, up 11 at 374p, and Scottish, ahead 20 at
585p, also excited interest.
Property company Argent Group made a successful market debut, being placed
at 255p and ending the day at 266p.
A top of the range dividend from Meyer International saw the timber group's
shares advance 18 to 453p. Amec was 6 firmer at 116p after the optimistic
comments at the annual meeting.
A presentation by Guinness, said to be with James Capel, helped the shares
appreciate 9 to 477p.
Amersham, the chemicals group, continued to reflect the excellent figures
released on Tuesday and subsequent profits upgrades, the shares closing 17
higher at 988p.
Shareholders at the Euro Disney agm were told that its FFr6bn rights issue
would be priced at around FFr10 per share and would be launched shortly. The
stock slid 10 to 405p. The company also cautioned that attendances for the
second half of this year could be lower than the period in the previous
year, although it forecast that losses in the same period would be lower.

FT  09 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Trading boost for Racal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, CHRISTINE BUCKLEY and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Electronics group Racal was the market's most heavily traded stock and one
of its best performers after the group accompanied its preliminary figures
with an optimistic statement on future prospects.
The company's profits were affected by a near Pounds 20m write-down due to
disposals and closure costs. But analysts and dealers focused on the
company's optimism for the current year, particularly on profit margins, and
a raft of profits upgrades are expected.
Racal shares raced up to 251p as the market digested the good news from the
analysts meeting, but subsequently came off their best to close a net 10 up
at 248p. Turnover of 12m shares was the highest single day's business in the
stock since its participation in Camelot, the consortium which won the race
to control the UK's National Lottery.

FT  09 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Some confidence returned to equity derivatives, with several large-scale
buyers pepping up the session, Christine Buckley writes.
The buyers, thought by some market watchers to be US-based, operated through
the independent traders delivering a few large orders on the June contract
on the FT-SE 100.
For the first time in recent sessions June traded at a premium to cash for
large stretches of the day. The contract had started on a healthy note -
opening just one point short of the cash index. June has suffered poor
fortunes in recent days, usually trading at a substantial discount to cash.
Volume jumped to 21,207 contracts reflecting the arrival of buying interest.
But derivatives traders were reluctant to speak of a sustained rally,
suspecting that investors remained nervous.
The contract closed at 3,032, six points behind cash after having traded in
a band of over 50 points.
Traded options were also more enlivened at 31,418 lots with index options
again the biggest feature, accounting for more than half of the trade.
A calendar spread was said to have been conducted in National Power with 500
June puts sold and 500 September puts bought.
British Gas was the most heavily traded of the stock options at 1,770
contracts.

FT  09 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equities turn higher following
production data - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A welcome return of institutional buyers for UK equities yesterday broke the
log jam of poor trading volume which had kept share prices subdued in the
two preceding sessions. A vigorous response to a strong rise in industrial
production in April raised hopes that share prices are poised to 'growth in
the economy, in company profits and in dividends', to quote one leading
market strategist.
The revival of optimism was also buttressed by assurances from Mr John
Major, the prime minister, that any control of dividends has been firmly
ruled out, thus removing one of the stock market's most significant causes
for concern. However, polling for the European parliamentary elections takes
place in the UK today, bringing the likelihood of a drubbing for Britain's
Conservative party.
The FT-SE Index closed 33.4 higher at 3,038.2, having touched 3,043.2
earlier. The advance was underlined by a return, for most of the session, to
premiums in the Footsie stock index futures which have been at a discount
for several sessions. Strength in UK government bonds, in spite of the
strong production data, encouraged equities. Confidence spread across the
full range of the stock market, lifting the FT-SE Mid 250 Index by 23.2
points to 3,600.8.
The market opened lower and it seemed at first that the Footsie 3,000 mark
was about to be tested again. The abrupt upswing, in both equities and
bonds, came following the news that April industrial production had risen by
1.6 per cent, for an annualised gain of 5.6 per cent; the UK Treasury later
added that manufacturing output for the three months to April stood at a
three year high.
Confidence was further encouraged by good trading statements from among
others, Meyer International and Northern Foods. The market made steady
progress, showing a gain of 38.4 at its mid-session peak.
Seaq volume was very thin in the first hour but gathered pace significantly
during the session. The final volume total of 591.7m shares showed a gain of
10 per cent over the figure for the previous day. Traders were confident
that the value of retail business, which will be disclosed today, will show
improvement from the still dismal Pounds 936m recorded on Tuesday.
'A very positive day for equities,' commented Mr Ian Harnett at Strauss
Turnbull, 'with clear signs that the market will now be driven by earnings
and dividend growth.' At Kleinwort Benson Securities, Mr Edmond Warner said
that Mr Major's assurance on dividend policy was 'very important. Probably
worth 75 to 100 points on the Footsie'. Mr Major's comments were regarded as
a significant committal to the City of London and to the financial markets.
Criticism of dividend-paying policies at British companies has been a
restraining factor on the stock market over the past month.
Background factors across Europe were also favourable to equities. The
modest reduction in money market repo rates in Germany was no surprise, but
favourable comments from both French and German central bankers also helped
sentiment. A slight softening in the US dollar at the close chastened
London.
The FT-SE Actuaries Committee yesterday announced that GKN will join the
list of FT-SE 100 Index components with effect from June 20, replacing
Tarmac.

FT  09 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei average climbs to
set two-year high
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO

<TEXT>
Equities hit their highest level in more than two years on soaring volume,
writes Robert Patton in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 average registered a low for the day of 20,930.20 in the
first few minutes of trading, and then climbed to set the session's high of
21,273.75 just before closing at 21,261.95, a 219.24 net gain and the
highest finish since March 2, 1992.
The market shrugged off a sharp rise in the yen triggered by remarks from Mr
Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, that raised the threat of
unilateral trade sanctions against Japan. Estimated volume nearly doubled to
600m shares from Tuesday's 305m. First section gainers led losers by 769 to
249, with 163 stocks unchanged.
The capital weighted 300 index closed 2.54 higher at 309.85 and the
first-section Topix index advanced 16.16 to close at 1,697.74. In London the
ISE/Nikkei 50 index put on 1.34 at 1,407.16.
The late afternoon rally that took the market to new highs was triggered by
life insurers and investment trusts, which had been on the sidelines for
weeks. Individual investors also began to re-enter the market as it gained
strength. High-technology and large-capital stocks, market favourites on
Tuesday, rose in active trade.
Oki Electric, second on the most-active list, climbed Y32 to Y740, its
highest level since 1991. The company gained strength from a report by New
Japan Securities that forecast that Oki's recurring profit would reach Y25bn
in the year to March 1995. The company had only projected Y10bn.
Fujitsu, the third most active stock, gained Y50 at Y1,150, while NEC picked
up Y30 to Y1,240.
Among other high-technology stocks, Sharp was up Y40 at Y1,840 and
Matsushita Electric Industrial finished Y30 stronger at Y1,900. Heavy
electricals also gathered buyers. Mitsubishi Electric moved ahead Y18 to
Y710, Hitachi rose Y20 to Y1,100 and Toshiba gained Y13 at Y842.
IC manufacturers in the US and Japan have been increasing production
capacity for advanced microprocessors and memory chips. Forecasts that
Japan's four leading semiconductor manufacturing equipment makers would
profit strongly from expanded demand attracted buying. Nikon was up Y30 to
Y1,080, Tokyo Electron rose Y20 to Y3,180, Kokusai Electric gained Y50 at
Y2,120 and Advantest added Y60 at Y3,430.
Car makers were strong. Fuji Heavy Industries, Mazda, and Suzuki set new
1994 peaks for the second day in a row. Fuji moved up Y4 to 474, Mazda
gained Y5 at Y626, Suzuki appreciated Y30 to Y1,510 and Nissan rose Y20 to
Y886.
In Osaka the OSE average reached 23,452.63, up 249.82, in volume of 89m
shares.
Roundup
There was no common theme to trading in the Pacific Rim.
HONG KONG ended firmer but trading was cautious as the market waited for the
government's package to cool the overheated housing market, announced after
the market closed. The Hang Seng index gained 43.30 at 9,291.18.
In the event, the package, which included a ban on the resale of unfinished
flats, was not expected to have much impact on property or share prices.
Among property issues, Cheung Kong was steady at HKDollars 38.25, New World
Development improved 50 cents to HKDollars 25.50 and Henderson Land rose 75
cents to HKDollars 41.25.
SYDNEY was helped higher by firmer base metal prices and sustained buying in
blue chips, The All Ordinaries index closed with a rise of 9.5 at 2,079.7.
In the resource sector, CRA jumped 32 cents to ADollars 19.06: its offshoot,
Coal and Allied Industries, announced plans to develop Vietnam's coal
resources.
SEOUL saw a technical rebound after the recent tensions over North Korea's
nuclear programme which took the composite index 11.30 higher to 933.02.
BOMBAY recovered from a an early downturn to close higher after an
unexpected announcement of a bonus issue by Tata Tea triggered a spate of
buy orders. The BSE 30-share index added 16.08 at 4,049.74 as Tata Tea
surged Rs160, or 23 per cent, to Rs830.
MANILA's four-day slide, which saw prices decline by 3.8 per cent, was
reversed by a round of bargain hunting, pushing the composite index 22.60
higher to 3,017.15.
TAIPEI rose, but closed off the day's best, in heavy trade in response to
Tuesday's news that Taiwan's exports hit a record high of Dollars 8.5bn in
May. The weighted index ended 28.73 up at 6,098.58, after touching 6,153, in
turnover that rose to TDollars 83.8bn from TDollars 66.2bn.
SINGAPORE shares closed flat in thin dealings, but Malaysian-OTC shares were
hard hit by reports that Prime Minister Mahathir has set up a committee to
look into money laundering in Malaysian listed companies. The Straits Times
Industrial index slipped 1.56 to 2,265.65.
KUALA LUMPUR drifted lower in sluggish trading which left the composite
index down 3.11 at 969.31.
Among gainers, however, was Malakoff, which rose 91 cents to MDollars 5.45
on reports that the company would be involved in an independent power
project in Thailand.
BANGKOK remained worried about political stability, sparked by wrangling
over constitutional reform, and the SET index lost 12.98 at 1,370.41 in
heavy turnover of Bt10.1bn.

FT  09 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Strong selling drives down
computer issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US stocks were mired in negative territory yesterday as a fresh upturn on
the bond market turned sour and technology issues tumbled, writes Frank
McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 6.46 easier at 3,749.45, having
recovered somewhat from a 20-point deficit during the afternoon. The more
broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was down 1.15 at 457.06. New York SE
volume was a moderate 256m shares.
In the secondary markets, the American SE composite lost 1.74 at 440.75, but
slumping computer stocks sent the Nasdaq composite down 9.51, or 1.3 per
cent, to 729.79.
It was yet another day without economic guidance from Washington, but
remarks by three senior officials helped to fill the void.
Earlier in the day, Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, said
inflation was 'clearly restrained', a comment which brought moderate gains
to the US Treasury market. In stocks, however, neither his pronouncement nor
the response it elicited had much impact.
But Mr Ron Brown, the US commerce secretary, created a minor stir. In Paris,
he said trade sanctions against Japan remained an option for Washington,
although the administration had no current plans to use them.
His statement triggered a fresh decline in the value of the dollar against
the yen, and coincided with a 10-point setback in the Dow industrials by
11am. But stocks worked their way back to just below their opening levels as
the afternoon session commenced.
Later, remarks by the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City
led to a late swoon in share prices. He said the US was nearing the point of
'full employment', an observation which reignited inflationary fears. A
subsequent slide by bonds tripped computer-guided sell programs, but many
equities fought back for a second time.
Foodmaker was among the most active as a block of stock worth about 5 per
cent of the fast-food operator was sold. Its share price dropped Dollars
3/4 to Dollars 5 1/2 soon after the sale, which the company said may have
been initiated by Tiger Management, a big institutional investor.
Computer stocks were facing strong selling pressure. Their setback was
linked to a warning by Merisel, a computer products wholesaler. It said its
earnings outlook had been clouded by an expected slowdown in the US computer
market. The stock plunged Dollars 6 3/4 to Dollars 10 on the announcement.
Semiconductor issues were hit hard by the forecast. On the Big Board, Texas
Instruments lost Dollars 3 1/2 to Dollars 76 1/4 . On the Nasdaq, Applied
Materials fell Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 76 1/4 .
Compaq was garnering lots of unwelcome attention. The stock dropped a
further Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 35 1/8 , after shedding Dollars 1 1/4 in
the previous session. IBM dipped Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 61 3/4 and Apple
shed Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 26 1/4 .
Among the more widely held Nasdaq issues, Lotus fell Dollars 3 3/8 to
Dollars 54, Microsoft receded Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 52 and Cyrix weakened
Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 25 1/2 .
Canada
Toronto finished sharply lower in moderate trading after nervous investors
had followed the lead of declining New York equities.
The TSE 300 composite index tumbled 50.8 to 4,201.3 and falls led advances
by 499 to 228. Volume came to 55.2m shares. The conglomerates group
retreated 2.3 per cent.
Venezuela
A technical correction wiped out a part of the recent strong gains on the
Caracas stock exchange, with the Merinvest composite index shedding 3.7 per
cent to 146.99.
The impact of the downturn was mixed, with benchmark Electricidad de Caracas
down 6.00 bolivars, less than 2 per cent, at 406 bolivars, while steel
company Sivensa and textile group Mantex, both of which had performed
strongly on Tuesday, eased 8 bolivars and 3 bolivars to 57 bolivars and 30
bolivars respectively.
Brokers attributed the falls to a technical adjustment following last week's
rally. Volume was up from Tuesday's level, with some 2m shares changing
hands in Electricidad de Caracas.

FT  09 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Reappraisal of banks helps
Frankfurt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The markets resumed a more orderly upward path yesterday, writes Our Markets
Staff.
FRANKFURT recovered from the nervousness which affected the market on
Tuesday as investors took the view that the sharp fall in bank shares had
been overdone.
The Dax index finished 10.10 up at 2,145.20, but slipped slightly in the
after market to 2,143.85. Turnover totalled DM6bn.
Sentiment was also assisted by another slight easing of the repo rate to
5.10 per cent ahead of today's Buba council meeting, although a cut in
interest rates today was not expected.
The bank sector had fallen on Tuesday as news broke that executives of a
manufacturer of floors for sports halls had been arrested on suspicion of
fraud involving up to DM1.6bn.
Analysts commented that by itself the development was not particularly
serious for the creditor banks since a consortium of up to 50 were involved,
with no single bank believed to have an exposure in excess of DM100m.
However, coming soon after the Schneider affair, and with rumours that
another property company might be in trouble, the outlook was less
reassuring, they added.
Among the banks, Deutsche eased DM4 to DM737.50, Commerzbank rose DM4.50 to
DM330.50 and Dresdner slipped DM2 to DM376.50.
PARIS was driven higher by strength in the bond market, and the CAC-40 index
closed the day 23.07 higher at 2,046.81. Turnover was FFr4bn.
Euro Disney came into prominence again as the theme park operator announced
the pricing for its rights issue at FFr10, at the top end of analysts'
expectations. However, the shares initialy dropped to FFr33 before reviving
to close off 90 centimes at FFr35.60.
Generale des Eaux went against the trend, sliding FFr62 to FFr2,344 in spite
of denying rumours that two of its directors had been arrested.
AMSTERDAM was lifted by the generally more positive tone on the Continent.
The AEX index closed 1.22 firmer at 406.50.
Unilever rose Fl 2.20 to Fl 192.50 as investors returned on the buy side
following the consumer group's buffeting in recent days over a dis-pute with
Procter &amp; Gamble regarding the merits of detergent products.
MILAN made early progress, in a continuation of Tuesday's rally, before the
market ran out of impetus as investors awaited the outcome of the Council of
Ministers meeting to discuss measures to boost employment, tax relief on
reinvested profits and an anonymous, flat rate tax for dividends.
The Comit index registered a 9.78, or 1.3 per cent, advance to 760.44 but
the real-time Mibel index, 113 ahead at one stage, finished 2 easier at
12,078.
Montedison picked up L16 to L1,480, after a high of L1,510, in heavy volume
of 52.6m shares after the European Union gave qualified approval to its
plastics joint venture with Shell.
SME, the supermarket and restaurant chain, added L78 to L3,978 after
reporting a 42 per cent rise in 1993 net profit.
ZURICH resumed its advance and volume picked up as foreign demand increased.
The SMI index added 23.0 to pierce the psychologically important 2,800-point
level and finish at 2,801.1.
Banks encountered some profit-taking but still finished mostly higher. UBS
rose SFr4 to SFr1,253 while SBC put on SFr6 to SFr426.
Among chemicals, Sandoz rose SFr18 to SFr745 in response to positive
analysts' comments and Roche added SFr50 to SFr6,890.
SMH was marked another SFr9 lower to SFr801 in further response to Tuesday's
comments on the outlook.
MADRID edged marginally higher, although Wall Street's early performance
chipped away at early gains. The general index rose 1.33 to 324.87.
Banco Santander rose Pta150 to Pta4,850 as Merrill Lynch raised its near
term rating on the stock.
STOCKHOLM turned higher in response to declining bond and money market
yields and positive trends in other European markets.
The Affarsvarlden index picked up 4.7 to 1,469.1. Trading activity dropped
sharply, with turnover down to SKr1.6bn from SKr2.2bn on Tuesday.
Interest rate sensitive bank and insurance stocks lead the advance.
S-E-Banken jumped SKr2 or 3.9 per cent to SKr50.50.
ATHENS finished 1.10 per cent lower in active trade of 1.6m shares as
investors held back, awaiting details of the government's plans to part
privatise the state telecommunications company, OTE, and two subsidiaries of
the Public Oil Corporations. The general index fell 9.4 to 845.14.

FT  09 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets: Israel
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Israel's equity market has been suffering - since the start of the year it
has plunged by nearly 50 per cent. Over the last week trading has been
highly volatile and on Tuesday, for instance, the Mishtanim index sank 5 per
cent in the morning sesion before staging a technical rally to end a shade
higher on the day. Yesterday the market rose 3 per cent.
Brokers attribute the nervousness to a number of factors, including
disappointment at the slow level of new investment following the Middle East
peace accord signed last year, disappointing first-quarter results and a
financial crisis rocking the country's largest health insurance fund.
The market is not included in emerging market indices published by the IFC
and Baring Securities, and is largely dominated by domestic investors.
According to research from Merrill Lynch, the country's banks are the
largest participants in the market, controlling an estimated 75 per cent of
the available shares.
Merrill adds that market capitalisation increased to nearly Dollars 51bn in
1993, up from Dollars 8bn in 1991 and Dollars 33bn in 1992.

FT  09 JUN 94 / Markets Report: Brown scares dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH and MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Comments from Mr Ron Brown, the US commerce secretary, enlivened an
otherwise quiet day on the foreign exchanges yesterday, write Philip Gawith
and Motoko Rich.
Speaking in Paris, Mr Brown told reporters that there was a 'serious
problem' in the bilateral relationship between the US and Japan. His remarks
caused the dollar to fall by nearly 60 basis points against the yen to
Y103.60, and by about 30 basis points against the D-Mark to DM1.6680.
It later recovered to finish in London at Y104.030 and DM1.6698, compared to
Tuesday's Y105.235 and DM1.6695 close. In New York the dollar ended at
Y103.95 and DM1.6684.
In the UK, sterling finished little changed at DM2.5163 from DM2.5159 as
European election worries offset a strong set of production figures.
Elsewhere, concern about a possible 'no' vote in Sunday's Austrian
referendum, on joining the European Union, weighed on the Swedish krona.
Sweden is also hoping to join the EU.
In Germany the Bundesbank cut the repo rate by five basis points to 5.10 per
cent, while the Belgian central bank lowered its central rate to 5.10 per
cent.
Although the dollar finished the day firmly, the market's skittish response
to Mr Brown's comments showed residual nervousness about the US currency.
Coming the day after a combative statement from Mr Mickey Kantor, the US
trade representative, it aroused fears that the US administration might not
have fully shaken off its 'dollar debasement' policy.
Mr Peter Luxton, economist at Barclays, said the officials' comments
reminded the markets that they had overestimated the 'apparent relaxed
attitude' of the US administration on trade with Japan. 'The markets got
over-euphoric over the past couple of weeks,' he said. 'But the super 301
locomotive is still rolling slowly through and everything is not all hunky
dory.'
Supporting a bearish case for the dollar were reports that most Japanese
traders who attended last week's Forex 94 conference in London were gloomy
on dollar/yen. Mr David Sumners, a managing director at Morgan Stanley in
London, said there was a feeling Japanese exporters still had lots of
dollars to sell, that short term speculators were all long of dollars, and
that the Japanese trade surplus would not disappear in a hurry.
But Ms Jane Edwards, international economist at Lehman Brothers in London,
said real interest rate differentials between the dollar and the D-Mark
could offer support to the US currency in coming weeks. She added that there
were increasing stories of money flowing out of European bonds and into US
Treasury bonds, and this capital inflow should lend support to the dollar.
Underpinning these flows is the fact that Treasury bond yields remain fairly
high, while second-quarter data on the demand side suggests the US economy
might be slowing towards a non-inflationary rate of growth. If this is
correct, US bond yields could fall and this would encourage a capital
inflow.
In Europe the main focus of attention was the upcoming Austrian referendum.
Concern that the Austrians might vote 'no' has caused the Swedish krona to
weaken recently. But the Swedish currency ended barely changed yesterday at
SKr4.754 per D-Mark.
Mr Tony Norfield, UK treasury economist at ABN-AMRO, said the referendum
should have 'very little direct implications' on the European currency
markets.
But Mr Luxton said fears of a 'no' vote in Austria were already making the
Swedish krona vulnerable. He added that in anticipation of poor Swedish
inflation figures being released today, the markets had 'geared up for a bit
of a sell-off in the Swedish krona'.
To some extent, though, the markets were knocking on an open door. The krona
was already weak on market fears that the government, faced with an election
in September, would not be able to apply the requisite mix of fiscal and
monetary policies.
Analysts say a fiscal tightening is necessary to curb the 10 per cent budget
deficit, but this needs to be accompanied by lower interest rates if the
recovery is not to be snuffed out. The government, however, finds itself
boxed in because it is difficult to cut rates against the backdrop of a
weakening currency. Ms Edwards commented: 'I do not see a way out that is
under the control of the Swedes at the moment.'
The futures markets were calmer after their recent gyrations. The December
short sterling contract traded 29,000 lots to finish at 93.79 from 93.78.
The December Euromark contract closed at 94.81 from 94.73.
German call money rates eased to 5.05/5.15 per cent from 5.10/5.20 per cent
after the repo. Traders are not, however, expecting any shift in official
rates at today's Bundesbank council meeting.
In the UK money markets, the Bank of England provided Pounds 357m liquidity
after forecasting a shortage of Pounds 350m. The overnight rate moved
between 4 and 5 1/4 per cent.

FT  09 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: 'Green' alliance comes to aid
of Australia's degraded land
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Australian farmers are being encouraged to tackle some of the huge
environmental problems facing their country's agricultural industry through
a series of local initiatives called Landcare.
Mr Andrew Campbell, a former Landcare co-ordinator, told a seminar in London
yesterday organised by the Sustainable Agriculture, Food and Environment
Alliance, that Landcare had attracted more than a third of Australian
farmers with 2,000 groups set-up nationwide.
European farming methods in Australia have caused many of the environmental
problems as they are unsuited to the continent's fragile soils and
unpredictable rainfall. Land degradation such as salinity, erosion and soil
structure decline affects over half of the nation's farmland at a cost of
more than ADollars 2.5bn a year, according to Safe.
Landcare groups consist of farmers, environmentalists, teachers and local
people, providing a useful social role as well as tackling environmental
problems. Mr David Clark, who farms 250 hectares of grassland in
South-eastern Victoria, runs one group which includes 120 farms and covers
40,000 hectares.
'In the past five years we've dramatically changed 40 to 50 per cent of the
landscape in our area, but it will take 30 years to solve the big problems,'
Mr Clark said.
Around 2 per cent of the land in Victoria is covered with salt and cannot be
farmed. At the same time, there is erosion of the land into huge gullies
extending over 500km. 'Most farmers don't like to see their land like this -
they can't produce on it and don't want to live with it like this,' Mr Clark
stressed.
His group has begun to attract urban dwellers who are keen to get to know
the countryside as well as local residents in a forum that promotes
understanding of the farming community.
Since Australian agriculture is not subsidised, the Landcare programme only
has government funding of ADollars 40m a year for setting up groups and
providing demonstration projects. Farmers do not receive aid for
environmental measures.
One of the strengths of the Landcare movement is its local focus - groups
concentrate on local issues and solutions that are relevant in that
particular area. Different groups are interested in varying issues.
The most important role of Landcare according to Mr Clark is that it's
'making farmers environmentalists'.

FT  09 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bulls return to London's copper
and coffee markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Commodities Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The copper and coffee markets, pacemakers in the recent commodities bull
run, were back in favour again yesterday.
The London Metal Exchange's flagship contract opened just above Dollars
2,300 a tonne for three months delivery, before surging to a 17-month high
of Dollars 2,377 as speculative money piled back into the market. It closed
a few dollars off the top at Dollars 2,375.50 a tonne, up Dollars 105 on the
day.
Although investment fund buyers played a big part in recent weeks, copper's
performance was underpinned by growing physical demand, which had been
reflected in 23 successive falls in LME warehouse stocks, dealers told the
Reuters news agency.
Coffee prices soared again as the market threw off its recent bout of
profit-taking. The September futures contract at the London Commodity
Exchange rose by Dollars 91 a tonne to Dollars 2,115 a tonne with the New
York market staging a big increase at the opening of trading.
Traders were jumpy about reports of cooler weather in Brazil as a frost
could affect the almost-mature beans, although this was not seen as a major
threat. In addition a one-day port strike in Santos, a big Brazilian coffee
shipment point, gave the market the jitters and helped to push prices
higher.
'There is still considerable upside potential in this market. We've just had
a respite and I believe we will go on to challenge and go through the recent
highs,' said Mr Bill O'Neill, soft commodities analyst at Merrill Lynch in
New York.

FT  09 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Danish farmers long for free
competition - Price cuts would be acceptable if they applied to everyone
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Niels Rovsing, a large pig producer in the Danish village of Balle,
complains that low pork prices are making it hard for him to make a living.
But he would be happier with lower prices if everyone in the European Union
experienced them.
'We need to go towards world prices, but every time we get close to them
other producers scream for subsidies from their governments,' he complains.
Danish producers are angry at reports that the French government has been
paying out aid for its pig producers who are also suffering from EU
overcapacity. The European Commission is investigating the alleged subsidies
after complaints from British farmers.
Pig prices are not supported by the EU, but exports outside of the union
receive a refund to compensate for high internal grain prices. Mr Rovsing
would like to see everyone competing on the world market, which would help
to eliminate roughly 3 to 4 per cent overproduction in the EU.
He reckons that about 5 per cent of Danish producers went out of business
over the past two years, when pork prices dropped from Dkr13.40 (Pounds
1.36) to Dkr8.40 a kilogram. But remaining farmers are unlikely to increase
their production to fill the gap.
A Danish law limits stocking density so that slurry can be disposed of. If
they do not have enough land, farmers they must be able to show contracts
for disposal by selling the slurry to their neighbours. This rule limits the
size of herds on most holdings.
Mr Rovsing grows winter barley, wheat and oilseed rape on his 65 hectares of
gently rolling farmland. He uses some of his grain to feed his 6,400 piglets
and 280 sows which are kept indoors all year round.
The number of Mr Rovsing's pigs makes him a large producer by Danish
standards. Farming is intensive, but most holdings remain family concerns.
Land ownership laws favour owner-occupiers and prevent large corporations
from buying agricultural holdings.
Mr Niels Peter Skrubbeltrang, chief adviser at the Danish Agricultural
Advisory Service, believes that, although the number of farms is likely to
shrink in the next 6 years, holdings will not necessarily get much larger.
'Danish farmers will not survive by getting bigger, but by making quality
products and that is easier to do with smaller farms,' he says.
Estimates put the number of Danish farms at 56,000 in 2000 compared with
72,000 today with the number of full-time farmers halving from 35,000.
Dairy farms are likely to increase in size as technology makes it easier for
farmers to deal with more animals, Mr Skrubbeltrang believes. But even the
expected increase in the average number of cows from 34 to 60 by 2000 would
still leave Danish dairy operations fairly small by UK standards.
'One of the big challenges for Danish farmers is to increase production with
the same cost base, making them more efficient. That is the way they need to
operate in the more competitive world after the Gatt agreement,' Mr
Skrubbeltrang explains.
Mr Jens Jakob Jakobsen, a dairy farmer with 112 cows, expects milk prices to
be reduced to world levels in the next five to 10 years. He thinks Danish
farmers will remain competitive as long as feed prices are lower.
'I am optimistic; I've just spent Dkr2.5m on building new barns, I expect my
son to take over from me and have a future in farming,' Mr Jakobsen
stresses. But his son will have to pay for Mr Jakobsen's farm at a price
only slightly below the commercial value. Danish law does not allow farmers
to bequeath their holdings to their offspring. This can build up large debts
in the business which some farmers believe restrict their room for
manoeuvre.
The strong co-operative movement in Danish agriculture enables most farmers
to have a marketing edge that would be lost to them alone. Farmers will be
looking to the co-ops to keep carving a market for them in the new
competitive world of Gatt.

FT  09 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bangladesh sets out to
streamline jute industry - A World Bank-backed restructuring programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REAZUDDIN AHMED
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bangladesh's jute industry, once the glory of the country's economy but more
recently a morass of bad debts, over-manning and decrepit equipment, has
embarked on its biggest-ever restructuring programme.
With the help of a USDollars 250m loan from the World Bank, the government
has in the past year started cutting labour and closing redundant mills.
Already some 12,000 workers have gone with generous retirement pay and a
further 8,000 are to leave in the next few months.
But there are doubts about whether the ruling party can complete the
programme for fear of generating a political backlash. With a general
election due in early 1996, or before, Mrs Khaleda Zia, the prime minister,
is already under pressure to avoid electorally-unpopular moves.
The scheme will ease the government's burden of financing the state-owned
industry, which has accumulated losses since 1972 of 50bn taka (USDollars
1bn). Streamlining the industry will also reduce costs for the surviving
mills, enhancing their ability to compete successfully in world markets both
in traditional goods such as matting and new products such as jute-based
paper and reinforcing material for dams.
The restructuring programme includes privatisation of 18 jute mills and the
closing of nine others to bring the number of looms down from 25,000 to
19,000. The government estimates that Bangladesh can sell 450,000 tonnes of
jute goods annually, which can be produced with 19,000 looms. Four jute
mills have already closed. Nine are to be privatised by the end of 1995 and
the remaining nine by December 1996. The government will retain only two
jute mills which are probably too big to be taken over by the private
sector.
The restructuring programme provides financial support to the jute mills so
that one-third of the debts can be written off and two thirds will be repaid
over 15 years after a three year moratorium. The outstanding loan will bear
only 3 per cent interest, 2 per cent below the country's bank rate. The
banks will also finance exports for the next three years.
Jute accounts for 12 per cent of Bangladesh's gross domestic product and 20
per cent of exports. About 5m people out of 118m are dependent on jute
production and processing.
Once called the golden fibre, jute declined after the nationalisation of the
industry in 1972, partly through inefficient operation and partly through
the growing popularity of nylon and other synthetic materials.
Annual world production of jute has remained static at 3.1m tonnes over the
last two decades. About 920,000 tonnes a year are exported by the producing
countries - Bangladesh, India, China, Thailand and Nepal. Bangladesh, the
biggest exporter, supplies 480,000 tonnes and India 215,000 tonnes.
Worries about the environment have opened up opportunities for promoting
jute as a green biodegradeable product. But the demand for new products is
in its infancy and prices remain low.

<TEXT>
Australian wheat production is expected to fall in 1994-95, because of the
lack of rainfall in major growing areas, writes Nikki Tait in Sydney.
Australian Wheat Forecasters estimated yesterday that output in 1994-95
would reach about 16.7m tonnes, compared with 17.52m tonnes in the previous
season. Sowing has progressed slowly because of the conditions, with no
wheat growing areas being sown early, and only some areas in Western
Australia being sown in sufficient time to allow for a long growing season.
The lack of rainfall has been particularly severe in parts of Queensland.

FT  09 JUN 94 / Government Bonds: Fed's conflicting inflation signals buffet
Treasuries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US Treasury bonds were buffeted yesterday by conflicting signals on
inflation from Federal Reserve policy-makers.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  7/32 lower
at 87 9/16 , with the yield slipping to 7.277 per cent. At the short end,
the two-year note was unchanged at 100 3/16 , to yield 5.755 per cent.
After trading higher for most of the session, bonds changed direction and
burrowed into negative ground at about 3pm. The reversal was triggered by Mr
Thomas Hoenig, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. He said
the US was approaching full employment, touching off fears of inflation.
Earlier in the day, remarks by Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, were
supportive. Although he declined to make any specific forecast on inflation,
Mr Greenspan said 'the numbers were clearly restrained'.
His words brought a welcome response in the Treasury market, where bonds
posted solid gains. Towards mid-morning, however, traders were distracted by
renewed weakness in the dollar.
The US currency suffered a fresh setback against the yen in the foreign
exchange markets after Mr Ron Brown, the commerce secretary, said the US
would not rule out trade sanctions against Japan, although Washington had no
immediate plans to use them.
As a result, bonds trimmed their gains, but soon stabilised and began
inching forward again. The dollar later firmed, but its recovery was
overshadowed by Mr Hoenig's remarks.
The strength of US bonds helped push German government bond prices higher.
However, further comments from Mr Hans Tietmeyer, president of the
Bundesbank, and data showing a slightly higher-than-expected rise in German
manufacturing orders in April later unnerved the market and limited further
advances.
Mr Tietmeyer said that the German economy was 'at the first stage of
recovery' and that he expected it to grow further.
'Bonds rose quickly in early trading, testing important technical levels,'
said Mr Peter Kerger, head of futures and options at NatWest Markets in
Frankfurt.
He said that the bund future on DTB, the German futures and options
exchange, was trading above its counterpart on Liffe, 'which is a rare
occurrence'. He added: 'People were taking up positive positions which
earlier they had liquidated.'
But analysts said that retail investors had still not fully regained their
confidence and that selling was still taking place. The September German
bund future on Liffe ended up 0.63 point at 92.93.
A stronger tone emerged in the UK government bond market yesterday despite
data showing a surge in manufacturing output.
Manufacturing output rose by 1.1 per cent in April, almost double the
consensus forecast of 0.5 per cent. But analysts said that the underlying
trend remained favourable.
Mr Simon Briscoe, UK economist at SG Warburg, pointed to the 1.7 per cent
rise in engineering output, which he said augured well for investment and
exports.
Mr Peter Fellner, gilt strategist at NatWest Markets, said: 'It has been a
better day but the market is still nervous and volatile. The general feel in
the international bond market has improved and this has fed through to
gilts.'
Mr Briscoe said gilts started the day higher, 'due to the fact that on
reflection the sell-off yesterday looked unjustified and the UK market was
weak in isolation. They then climbed higher with strength in continental
markets.'
Analysts reported overnight buying from investors in east Asia and buying at
lower levels across all maturities. The long gilt future was up 1 7/16 point
at 101 15/16 in late trade.
French government bonds moved higher yesterday, due mainly to the strength
in German and US markets.
Analysts said the cut of five basis points in the Bundesbank's securities
repurchase rate to 5.10 per cent provided some relief. Although largely in
line with expectations, there had been some concern that the German central
bank might set a fixed-rate repo.
Support was also provided by remarks made yesterday by Mr Jean-Claude
Trichet, the French central bank governor. He said: 'Inflation is under
control, thanks to the vigilance of monetary policy and economic
fundamentals in France.'

FT  09 JUN 94 / International Capital Markets: US broker in Dollars 33m
compensation move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PaineWebber, one of the largest US brokerage houses, is taking the highly
unusual step of compensating investors in a government-bond fund for losses
suffered in recent weeks.
The firm is to pay Dollars 33m to buy back high-risk classes of
mortgage-backed securities held by its Short-Term US Government Fund. The
fund, which has about Dollars 1bn in assets, is managed by Mitchell Hutchins
Asset Management, a PaineWebber subsidiary.
Removing the securities from the fund's portfolio would diminish the
potential for future volatility and reduced liquidity, PaineWebber said.
The plan would help offset a sharp deterioration in the mutual fund's value
since US interest rates began to rise in early February. In the past two
months alone, its net asset value dropped 11 cents to Dollars 2.30, or about
4.5 per cent.
Much of the downturn reflected the poor performance of the securities in
question, known as collateralised mortgage obligations. Such derivatives,
which are linked to payments on underlying pools of mortgages, have come
under increasing pressure in an atmosphere of climbing rates.
The firm said the securities, mostly acquired over the last year,
contributed to 6 cents of the total decline in the fund's net asset value
since late April. It said it would inject enough cash into the fund to make
up the mortgage-related losses.
PaineWebber is taking the steps as part of an agreement in principle to
settle a class action suit filed by some of the fund's investors.
Although the fund was not prohibited from including mortgage-backed
securities, the prospectus made clear its managers would eschew such
volatile financial instruments.
As part of the settlement, PaineWebber would also make direct payments to
investors who redeemed their shares after April 28.

FT  09 JUN 94 / International Bonds: Ontario's Dollars 1bn global offering
meets strong demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Province of Ontario's Dollars 1bn of 10-year bonds - its first global
offering in the current fiscal year - was launched yesterday and met with
strong demand, syndicate officials said.
Offering an indicated yield spread over US Treasuries of 67-70 basis points,
the bonds were seen to offer good value and the lead managers reported
strong demand from international investors.
'It was very encouraging that we saw not only American demand, but also a
good bid from European and Far Eastern institutions,' said one syndicate
manager. The deal, led by joint bookrunners Goldman Sachs and Salomon
Brothers, will be priced today. Dealers expect the yield spread to be at the
lower end of the indicated range.
Also in the US dollar sector, Wal-Mart Stores launched a successful issue of
Dollars 250m five-year bonds via Goldman Sachs. The deal met with strong
demand from retail investors, traders said.
'It's one of those great retail-driven blow-out deals,' said a syndicate
manager at another house. 'We would have loved to have led it,' he added.
Priced to yield 32 basis points over Treasuries at the fixed re-offer, the
spread tightened in after the issue was freed to trade and ended the day at
30 basis points over Treasuries on the bid price.
In the D-Mark sector, DM300m of 7 1/8 per cent five-year bonds for the Bank
of China got off to a slow start. Lead manager Commerzbank said it was
confident the paper would get placed over time, aided by the fact that a
double taxation agreement between Germany and China enables some investors
subject to German taxation to increase their after-tax yield by an
additional 15 per cent of the nominal coupon.
However, officials at other banks were more sceptical, arguing that the
deal's 105-basis-point yield pick-up over bunds at the price to investors
was unlikely to attract retail demand.
Undaunted by the recent slew of issuance in the Canadian dollar sector,
three more borrowers tapped that market, all in the four-year sector:
Commerzbank Overseas Finance issued CDollars 150m of bonds via IBJ
International, Electricite de France launched CDollars 125m of paper via
Paribas Capital Markets, and the Belgian savings bank ASLK-CGER issued
CDollars 75m of bonds via Wood Gundy.
The Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation is about to add to supply in
the Canadian dollar sector, after announcing yesterday that it plans to
issue a global bond soon. Dealers said that the deal could emerge as early
as today if market conditions remained stable, and were calling for a
CDollars 1bn five-year global offering from the government-guaranteed unit,
which sold its first CDollars 1bn global bond last November.
Meanwhile, the European Investment Bank was said to be taking bids for a
Dollars 500m deal which could also be launched today, traders said.

The adage that football comes before business in Brazil was proven again
yesterday when the Sao Paulo stock exchange announced changes to trading
hours during the World Cup.
On the three days later this month when Brazil is playing, the exchange will
sacrifice its lunch break in order to stop work two hours earlier than
normal, at 2.30pm local time.
'Since the games start at 5pm, people will have time to finish their duties
and still watch the matches,' said Mr Flavio Guimaraes, exchange spokesman.
About 100 of the exchange's 500 staff will remain on duty during the games
to man vital services. Stockbroking firms are expected to follow the
exchange's lead and allow workers to stop work early.
Football, Brazil's national passion, often interrupts commerce but it is the
first time for 20 years that the exchange has altered its trading routine to
accommodate it.
If the team progresses to the later rounds, the exchange may extend the
idea. According to one broker, the closer Brazil gets to the final, the less
chance there is of persuading people to remain at work.

FT  09 JUN 94 / International Company News: Sumitomo Life details level of
its non-performing loans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sumitomo Life Insurance Corporation, Japan's third largest life insurer, has
indicated that about half of the Y1,400bn (Dollars 13.2bn) it has advanced
in loans may be non-performing. The news comes as company sources say that
its chairman will resign, the latest victim of the country's economic
downturn.
The sources said that Mr Yasuhiko Uewama would step down, probably today, in
acknowledgment of his own responsibility for the company's performance in
the last few years.
Sumitomo, which has total assets of Y20,000bn, has a huge exposure to bad
debts incurred by its six affiliated non-bank financial institutions.
In the late 1980s, spurred by soaring asset prices in Japan's booming
financial markets, Sumitomo Life, under the personal direction of Mr Uewama,
advanced Y1,400bn in loans to the affiliates, mainly mortgage and lending
companies.
The company has indicated that around half of the total loans advanced are
now non-performing, a staggeringly high total even by the standards of
Japan's recent financial excesses.
All of Japan's leading life insurers, which are due to report their annual
results today, have been severely hit in recent years by falling asset
values, such as equities. Several have seen their profits decline by more
than 20 per cent between 1991 and 1993; in Sumitomo's case the figure is 30
per cent.
In the next three years, Sumitomo plans to write off at least Y400bn of the
problem loans, a charge that will further hit earnings.
Mr Uewama's resignation is expected to be approved at a directors' meeting
on July 5, when the current vice-chairman, Mr Tadaoki Haraguchi, will assume
the chairmanship. The new boss will immediately feel the cost of the
company's difficulties. Sumitomo Life has decided to cut the remuneration of
its directors, eliminating bonuses and reducing salaries by as much as 10
per cent.

FT  09 JUN 94 / International Company News: Steven Green renews link with
Milken in Heron bid - Trusts belonging to the junk-bond king are among
partners bidding for Heron
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Eight years ago Mr Michael Milken, then the unquestioned junk-bond king,
backed a near-Dollars 200m deal which enabled Mr Steven Green to buy a
string of supermarkets in California.
Times have moved on. Last year, Mr Milken was released from jail after
serving a sentence for securities-related offences, and is battling prostate
cancer. Mr Green, meanwhile, has continued to add to a property empire built
up over the past 20 years.
This week, the connection was renewed. Mr Milken's family trusts (the
beneficiaries are his three children) are among the members of a limited
partnership put together by Mr Green to bid for Heron, the UK property
group.
'Mike Milken financed one of my real estate transactions. He had an
opportunity to see how we turned that investment into a very substantial
profit to the participants,' Mr Green said yesterday.
Until recently, Mr Green was little known outside US property circles. That
changed in 1990, when he was thrust into the limelight as chairman of E-II,
a holding company whose interests included the Samsonite luggage business,
Culligan International, a maker of water purifiers, and the 500 Fashion
group.
A protege of Mr Meshulam Riklis, the US deal-maker who had bought E-II from
American Brands in 1988, Mr Green was caught in the middle of a heated
battle for control of the company. Mr Riklis had been ousted in a bondholder
revolt.
Investors led by Mr Carl Icahn, the financier who at one time owned TWA,
later rejected Mr Green's plans for restructuring the debt-laden company and
forced it into bankruptcy protection.
In the following years, Mr Icahn and Mr Leon Black, supporter of Mr Green
and a former head of mergers and acquisitions at Drexel Burnham Lambert,
fought for control of E-II, before Mr Black finally held sway a year ago.
Now renamed Astrum International, the holding company has emerged from
bankruptcy protection, with Mr Green still at the helm. He has in the
meantime been growing his US property vehicle, Auburndale Properties.
This now owns more than 11m sq ft of residential and industrial property in
the US. With the bid for Heron, Mr Green hopes to launch himself for the
first time in the European property markets.

National Mutual, the second largest life office in Australia, yesterday
announced that its profits after tax in the six months to end-March fell to
ADollars 20.6m (USDollars 15.1m), compared with ADollars 112.1m a year
earlier.
The company said that performance in the second quarter had suffered from
volatility in world equity and currency markets and the upward trend in
long-term interest rates. Unrealised investment losses in the period total
ADollars 50.1m.
The company is currently a mutual but has mooted the possibility of changing
itself into a shareholder-owned company at some stage.
G. E. Crane, the New South Wales-based metal fabrication and plumbing
supplies group, said yesterday that it was buying the Mico Wakefield group
of companies in New Zealand for NZDollars 54.25m (USDollars 32.2m).
The New Zealand company has 28 branches, employs 400 people and has annual
sales of about NZDollars 140m a year.
Bridge Oil, the Australian oil and gas group which is facing an unsolicited
ADollars 294m (USDollars 216m) bid from Parker &amp; Parsley, the Texan oil
independent, revealed yesterday that it was in talks with other potential
purchasers. P&amp;P's offer is worth 70 cents a share.

FT  09 JUN 94 / International Company News: Net income increases at SA
conglomerate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rembrandt, the South African tobacco-based conglomerate, managed to shake
off the previous year's static performance to report a 10.3 per cent advance
in attributable earnings, to 200.9 cents a share from 182.1 cents, for the
12 months to March.
Net income before tax rose 6.4 per cent to R1.3bn (Dollars 361m) from
R1.25bn. As a result of a cut in corporate tax the company paid slightly
less tax of R408.8m, compared with R478.1m, while net income after tax rose
19.3 per cent to R924.6m from R774.7m.
The company is one of South Africa's largest and most consistently
successful conglomerates. It is controlled by the Rupert family, which also
controls Swiss-based tobacco and luxury goods company Richemont.
The group's final dividend is 26.4 cents a share, bringing the total for the
year to 43.44 cents, up from 36.2 cents a share.
Rembrandt, which did not release a breakdown of performance by units,
dominates the local tobacco industry with a market share of around 80 per
cent. This sector normally contributes about 40 per cent to Rembrandt's
bottom line.
Growth is expected to continue next year, but analysts warn that a possible
increase in excise duties and other tobacco taxes may hurt the company.
Following the unbundling of Gencor last year, and Rembrandt's decision to
exchange shares in Genbel for further shares in Malbak, Rembrandt has
declared its interests in the unbundled companies to be: Gencor, 13.8 per
cent; Engen, 6.8 per cent; Sappi, 5.1 per cent; and Malbak, 7 per cent. Only
the Gencor interests have been accounted in the results.

FT  09 JUN 94 / International Company News: Ford plans to develop new range
of small car
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ford, the US carmaker, has approved the development of a new small car aimed
at taking it into a segment of the European market below the supermini class
in which it sells its smallest car, the Ford Fiesta.
The company said yesterday that a decision on a production location had not
been reached, but it is probable that the new car will be produced at Ford's
plant in Valencia, Spain.
Along with its rival volume carmakers, Ford has been intensively studying
the potential of the so-called 'sub-B' segment of the European car market
beneath the B-class superminis such as the Opel/Vauxhall Corsa, the Ford
Fiesta, the Renault Clio and the Nissan Micra.
At present this segment is dominated by Fiat of Italy with its Fiat
Cinquecento, produced in Poland for west European markets.
Ford showed a concept study for a 'sub-B' car, called the Ka, at the Geneva
motor show in March.
Mr Alex Trotman, Ford chairman and chief executive, said in an interview
with Automotive News, the US motor industry magazine, that the new car range
would be launched in the next two to three years.
Other volume carmakers, such as General Motors (Opel in continental Europe
and Vauxhall in the UK) and Volkswagen, are expected to follow Ford into the
emerging 'sub-B' segment of the market.
Ford says its new small car must be capable of carrying four adults as well
as some luggage.
Volkswagen has also announced plans for a cheap small car to be sold for
less than DM15,000 (Dollars 9,375) from 1996. It will be shorter than the
new Polo supermini to be introduced later this year, but it will share many
of the Polo's basic components.
Ford's 'sub-B' car is expected to be derived from a shortened Fiesta chassis
platform.

year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Premier, the South African food, retail and pharmaceutical retail group,
reported an 11 per cent rise in attributable earnings to R259.1m (Dollars
72m) for the year to April.
Trading profit rose 45 per cent to R634.7m from R438.9m and after-tax profit
increased 33 per cent to R416.9m from R314.5m.
Group turnover jumped to R14.4bn from R10.15bn, a gain of 42 per cent, but
the figures are not directly comparable as several subsidiaries have been
consolidated for the first time.
A final dividend of 6.5 cents has been declared, bringing the total for the
year to 10.5 cents, a rise of 12 per cent on last year's 9.4 cents.
Mr Peter Wrighton, outgoing executive chairman, noted that the results had
been achieved during one of the most difficult years in the group's history
given the political and socio-economic turmoil in the run-up to April's
national elections.
He noted the food and retail sector had been under strain because of the
poor trading environment.
However, Mr Wrighton singled out the group's pharmaceutical interests, which
had increased its share of turnover to R2.1bn, or 14 per cent on the year
from R0.5bn, or 5 per cent, for a 'magnificent' performance.
Mr Wrighton said negotiations were under way with several international
groups on ties and he expected a deal to be reached with one or more of them
'within the year'.
He expressed confidence in Premier's future, noting that the company was
well placed to take advantage of the new government's planned reconstruction
and development programme.
Mr Wrighton will step down at the end of the year.
His replacement as chairman will be Mr Doug Band, formerly chairman of Argus
group. Mr Gordon Utian, the deputy managing director, has been promoted to
managing director.

FT  09 JUN 94 / International Company News: Battle for RWE set to intensify
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A struggle for effective control of RWE, Germany's largest utility group,
could intensify after the appointment today of a new chairman.
Mr Dietmar Kuhnt, chairman of RWE Energie, a subsidiary of the group, will
succeed Mr Friedhelm Gieske, who will formally retire next January.
Mr Kuhnt will inherit an anachronistic voting system which gives Germany's
64 municipalities voting powers disproportionate to the size of their
holdings.
The municipalities account for 58.9 per cent of the total votes, but hold
29.3 per cent of the share capital.
Mr Gieske had already indirectly supported a group of private investors who
in 1992 had attempted, but failed, to abolish the majority voting powers of
the municipalities.
'If we want to become a truly international company, then we must have a
share holding and voting system which complements our international
activities,' one RWE shareholder said. Nearly 84 per cent of RWE's capital
stock is German-held, and less than 10 per cent is held by foreign
investors.
The municipalities have since resisted change and are reported to have
opposed Mr Gieske's initial support of Mr Hans-Peter Keitel, the 46-year-old
chairman of Hochtief, the construction division of RWE, on the grounds that
Mr Keitel might try to reform the voting system, while Mr Kuhnt would prefer
consensus.
Even though Mr Gieske will no longer be board chairman after next January,
the municipalities are aiming to end his influence over RWE by trying to
block his nomination to the supervisory board. ,
The municipalities hold five of the 19 seats on the supervisory board. The
board will meet next October to decide if it will recommend Mr Gieske's
appointment to RWE's annual general meeting in December. Even if it does,
the municipalities' majority vote could prevail, which would postpone any
fundamental change in RWE's voting structure.

The French telecommunications groups Alcatel Alsthom and France Telecom will
join Globalstar, a global satellite-based mobile telephone system formed by
US groups Loral and Qualcomm, AP-DJ reports from Paris.
Loral said France Telecom would own a 51 per cent interest in a joint
venture with Alcatel, which will hold 49 per cent. Total investment in the
joint venture, called Tesam, is Dollars 37.5m, and represents about 8.3 per
cent of the ownership of Globalstar. Tesam will be an owner and service
provider of Globalstar in France and 'a number of other territories', Loral
said.
Loral said Globalstar would begin service in 1998, and is expected to have
revenues of Dollars 1.6bn and 2.7m subscribers by the year 2002.
Earlier this year McCaw, the US cellular operator, and Microsoft, the US
software concern, disclosed plans to set up a Dollars 9bn system of 840
communications satellites.

FT  09 JUN 94 / International Company News: Broking tough man rejoins the
fray - Richard Waters profiles the new Alexander &amp; Alexander chairman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Frank Zarb has been here before - a broking firm with a long and
venerable history, but losing ground to competitors and with little control
over its costs. And it is part of an industry without a tradition of strong
management, where poorly performing firms are quicker to blame market
conditions than their own shortcomings.
In 1988, it was stockbroking. This week, it is insurance broking.
Mr Zarb - once head of the Smith Barney stockbroking firm - emerged late on
Tuesday as chairman, chief executive and president of Alexander &amp; Alexander,
the US-based insurance broker.
For the 59-year-old native of Brooklyn, it will be a challenging end to a
long and varied career. Once a senior partner at Lazard Freres in New York,
and a former energy adviser to President Gerald Ford, much of Mr Zarb's
career has been spent in the stockbroking industry, where he has gained a
reputation as a tough operating manager.
Hired in 1988 by Mr Sanford Weill, head of Primerica (now renamed
Travelers), Mr Zarb was behind a turnround at Smith Barney - though much of
the recovery was due to the improvement in the stockbroking market after its
post-crash lull in the late 1980s.
Investors will be hoping he can work the same magic on Alexander &amp;
Alexander. The share price of the insurance broker, the world's second
biggest, has languished in recent years, as the company has been battered by
a succession of one-off charges, high costs and a weak property/casualty
insurance market.
Last year, it revealed its consulting business had been overstating its
income by failing to allow sufficiently for fees that would not be
recovered.
The year before, it took a Dollars 145m after-tax charge for liabilities
taken on when it acquired the Sphere Drake insurance company during the
1980s.
Alexander &amp; Alexander may have come to look accident-prone in recent years,
but its troubles can be traced back to the early 1980s, when it first
embarked on an international acquisition spree, buying Alexander Howden in
the UK and Reed Stenhouse in Canada.
'They grew too fast,' says one person close to the company. 'They developed
a certain amount of feudalism: different parts worked in different
directions.' One result was a lack of control over costs. The company was
also rocked during the 1980s by fraud-related losses at Alexander Howden,
the Lloyd's broker.
By January, the depth of the problems became clear. Mr Tinsely Irvin was
replaced as chairman. At the same time, J. P. Morgan and CS First Boston
were hired to find a way of buttressing the company's finances.
It slipped into loss in the first quarter, losing Dollars 15m. By the end of
March it was in breach of the terms of a banking facility, further limiting
its financial flexibility.
Options considered in recent months have included an outright sale of the
company, the disposal of some of its businesses, and raising additional
equity capital.
'Frankly, our goal is to preserve the independence of this fine franchise,'
said Mr Robert Boni, who has served as interim chairman since January. 'We
strongly believe there are great opportunities here to restore it to its
rightful place in the industry.'
Help finally came from Mr Maurice Greenburg, a renowned figure in the US
property/casualty insurance industry. As head of American International
Group (AIG), Mr Greenburg has established a reputation as a highly astute
investor. His decision to invest Dollars 200m in A&amp;A already looks
well-timed. The terms, which allow AIG to covert its holding into non-voting
shares at Dollars 17, were agreed in mid-May, when A&amp;A's share price touched
bottom at around Dollars 14. Yesterday, the shares were trading at Dollars
17 1/4 .
With the breathing space granted by the AIG investment, what can Mr Zarb do
to turn A&amp;A around?
It seems a fair bet that cutting operating costs will be high on his list.
'I don't want to be pious,' he says, 'but in financial services businesses,
you have to run your business so you do well in bad markets. And if you do
that, you're going to do terrific in a good market. That is exactly how we
ran Smith Barney.'
Mr Boni goes further. 'Too much of the brokerage industry excused itself in
the past for its deteriorating margins,' he says. Now, the pressure is on to
find better and more efficient ways of conducting business.
New technology, better training, re-engineering of processes - all those
things will lead to much improved productivity in the industry, he says.
And for A&amp;A brokers who fear that they will be harangued endlessly by Mr
Zarb for not matching up to Smith Barney, there is hope - the new chairman
promises he will refrain from making too many comparisons with the
stockbroker he once headed.

Nippon Telegraph and Telephones is planning a trial of interactive

the US computer manufacturer.
The planned system will link consumers, businesses and government ministries
to new kinds of information services and computing power, the Japanese
telecommunications group said.
'The interactive multimedia services system, in combination with the
fibre-optic digital network being introduced by NTT, will serve the
expanding needs of a wide range of users,' said Mr Masashi Kojima, president
of NTT.
The companies said they had reached a preliminary agreement for Silicon to
supply computers and software for the project, which will be the first trial
of interactive multimedia services in Asia.
Several trials are already under way, or planned, in the US.

Brazil's Securities and Exchange Commission (CVM) has moved closer to the
modernisation of its stock exchanges by allowing non-financial institutions
to form and manage mutual equity funds, Reuter reports from Sao Paulo.
CVM president Mr Thomas Tosta de Sa said: 'We want to make the rules
flexible for the stock market in Brazil.' He said the measure would come
into effect over the next few days.
'The CVM's board of directors will approve the measure today. It will be
effective as soon as the board's decision is published in the government's
official gazette,' Mr Tosta de Sa said.
He said consultant firms, as well as individuals, would be allowed to form
and manage their own equity funds.
According to current stock market rules, only financial institutions are
allowed to open stock funds in Brazil.
CVM officials said, however, that stock custody and distribution rules would
remain unchanged.
'An individual will be allowed to open an equity fund, but he still needs a
financial institution to provide the custody and distribution of the shares
for him,' Mr Tosta de Sa said.

FT  09 JUN 94 / International Company News: US funds buy paper mill debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Several US investment funds have emerged as the biggest creditors of the
troubled Gold River newsprint mill in British Columbia, after buying more
than half of its CDollars 230m (USDollars 166.6m) debt at a deep discount.
The involvement of the US funds - so-called 'vulture funds', because they
seek to profit from distressed businesses - has made the future of the mill
even more uncertain.
Gold River is one of the most modern paper mills in the world. It has been
mothballed since Christmas, when its bankers turned down a proposal by its
biggest shareholder, Avenor (formerly Canadian Pacific Forest Products) for
short-term funding.
An official at Odyssey Partners of New York, one of the US funds, said the
mill was 'an excellent piece of equipment' with 'a lot of value'. He
declined to give details of Odyssey's intentions, but indicated that some
developments were likely within the next few weeks.
Mr David Toole, Avenor's chief financial officer, said the company had so
far had no contact with its new creditors. It is drawing up proposals aimed
at restarting the mill. These include securing cheaper and more reliable
wood supplies.
Avenor wrote off its entire CDollars 147m investment in Gold River last
year. Its eight partners include publishers in the US, UK, Japan and
Singapore.
The bank lenders are understood to have received between 19 and 30 cents per
dollar of face value for their loans. A leading member of the bank group
said: 'When the 'vulture capitalists' get involved and you lose the majority
of the bank syndicate, it gets to be too much trouble.'
Banks which have sold their loans include Toronto-Dominion, Union Bank of
Switzerland, and Royal Bank of Canada. TD has been replaced as leader of the
creditor group by Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the international accountants.
The removal of Gold River's annual output of 230,000 tonnes from the market
helped other North American newsprint producers impose a 6 per cent to 7 per
cent price rise earlier this year. The producers hope to push through a
second, similar increase in August.

FT  09 JUN 94 / International Company News: IBM seeks lifting of decree
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IBM wants to persuade the US courts to lift restrictions on its computer
services business, imposed in a 1956 anti-trust consent decree. The decree
forces IBM to separate its US 'outsourcing' business, which manages computer
centres on behalf of customers, from other operations.
IBM lawyers this week discussed the decree with a New York Federal judge,
but have not filed any motions with the court. The decree arose from a 1952
government complaint alleging IBM had monopolised the market for tabulating
machines, the precursor to the electronic computer.
The terms of the decree include orders that IBM must operate its 'service
bureaux' business as a separate wholly-owned subsidiary, which must pay for
IBM computer equipment and software on the same terms as its competitors in
the service business.
The decree also restricts IBM in its sales of used computer equipment. It
may only acquire used computers when they are traded in or exchanged for
credit on new equipment. It must then go through a 60-day listing and
remarketing procedure before it can sell the equipment.
'We think the decree operates to the disadvantage of customers by
artificially raising our costs and preventing us from passing on to our
customers the benefits of our integrated operations in marketing, services,
manufacturing and development,' IBM said.

Orkla, the diversified Norwegian group, reports a dip in pre-tax profits for
the first four months, to NKr299m (Dollars 54.4m) from NKr303m in the same
period last year, writes Karen Fossli in Oslo. The fall came in spite of a
NKr902m rise in sales, to NKr6.4bn.
The beverage division was the weakest performer, with an operating loss of
NKr32m against a profit of NKr10m.
A fall in group operating profit, from to NKr289m from NKr321m, was blamed
on expansion and restructuring.

FT  09 JUN 94 / International Company News: LIN Broadcasting to spin off TV
station business

LIN Broadcasting, the cellular telephone company in which McCaw Cellular
Communications owns a 52 per cent stake, is to spin off LIN Television, its
TV station business, to shareholders in a tax-free distribution of shares.
The company also announced an agreement to buy WTNH-TV, an affiliate of the
ABC network in Connecticut, from Cook Inlet Communications for about Dollars
120m in cash and 11.5 per cent of LIN Television common shares.
The two moves, expected to be completed by the end of this year, will create
a publicly-quoted company which owns seven television stations affiliated to
the three big US broadcasting networks.
Public shareholders would own 42 per cent of LIN Television and McCaw would
hold 46 per cent.
The business had pro forma 1993 revenues of Dollars 160m and broadcasting
cashflow of Dollars 80m. Cities served by its stations include Dallas,
Texas, Indianapolis, Indiana and Norfolk, Virginia.
Mr Craig McCaw, chairman of both McCaw Cellular and LIN Broadcasting, said
television and cellular were two fundamentally different businesses and
should be managed separately.
'We believe the spin-off enables LIN Television to continue to do
acquisitions like WTNH-TV, and feel there is a substantial opportunity for
an independent, highly-focused television business to grow rapidly,' he
said.
AT&amp;T, the largest US long-distance telephone group, has agreed to buy McCaw,
the nation's largest cellular telephone company, for Dollars 12bn. The deal,
however, is still subject to a prolonged regulatory review.
If that deal goes through, many analysts expect AT&amp;T to buy out minority
shareholders in LIN Broadcasting to strengthen its market position in
cellular.

FT  09 JUN 94 / International Company News: Eni savours the taste of freedom
 -Franco Bernabe outlines plans to Robert Graham and Andrew Hill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM and ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Eni, the Italian state oil concern, swung back into profit in 1993 after 18
months of restructuring.
The switch to last year's L419bn (Dollars 259m) profit from a 1992 loss of
L815bn was due to an improved industrial performance, cost savings and asset
sales of L1,700bn.
Mr Franco Bernabe, chief executive, said he anticipated a further
strengthening of Eni's profits during the year. The group was on course for
privatisation but the decision on how to proceed with the sell-off was in
the hands of the Berlusconi government, he added.
These are the first full year's accounts under Mr Bernabe's management. He
has been at the helm during an exceptionally difficult period when Eni's
activities have been placed under the microscope by anti-corruption
magistrates.
Last year saw the arrest on corruption charges of Mr Gabriele Cagliari,
Eni's chairman, who committed suicide in prison, as well as the chief
executives of all the main operating companies - Nuovo Pignone (gas
turbines), Agip (oil and gas exploration/production), Saipem (pipelines) and
Snam (gas marketing/distribution).
Mr Bernabe observed drily: 'One of the reasons why we have been able to
achieve better results is that we have been able to operate without
political interference. We have been able to manage our business on
commercial criteria.'
In spite of difficult conditions and lower crude oil prices, gross earnings
rose 8 per cent to a record L53,000bn from L49,800bn. Operating profits rose
to L11,300bn from L9,800bn.
A strong energy sector, which accounts for 90 per cent of activity, helped
offset problems in Eni's chemicals and the heavily loss-making fertiliser
operations. Mr Bernabe said much attention was devoted to slimming down
Eni's base chemicals and fertilisers operations last year.
The inheritance left by the costly merging of Eni's chemicals interests with
those of Ferruzzi-Montedison in the now defunct Enimont, transformed into
Enichem, had to be dealt with. 'We closed five large agro-chemical plants
(in Italy); and we halved capacity, concentrating on plants at Ferrara and
Ravenna,' he said.
Restructuring of chemicals and fertilisers accounted for the bulk of the
L1,400bn extraordinary costs (against the 1992 L1,200bn, adjusted for
comparison). Much of the remainder covered closure of Eni's non-ferrous
metals operations in Sardinia. The main cost item was payments for
redundancy and early retirement.
Eni's payroll dropped during the year to 106,000 from 124,000 and this year
will fall to about 95,000.
The principal among 59 asset sales was that of Nuovo Pignone to General
Electric, with Eni retaining a 20 per cent stake. Mr Bernabe estimated asset
sales would raise L5,800bn between 1992-96 with L1,000bn expected this year.
This income has helped cover restructuring costs and hold down net debt.
Mr Bernabe is particularly pleased that net debt has fallen by L300bn to
L28,900bn after having risen by almost one third between 1989-92. 'We are
now one year ahead of the agreements with the EU which envisaged a ceiling
being fixed on debt at the level pertaining at the end of 1994.'
Mr Bernabe has been weeding out the least efficient subsidiaries. As a
result, 33 businesses have been closed in Italy and 40 overseas. Capital
spending has been trimmed (L10,400bn against L10,700bn) with more emphasis
on essential projects such as doubling the capacity of the pipeline bringing
Algerian gas via Tunisia under the Mediterranean.
Savings have been achieved by renegotiating some of Eni's overseas oil and
gas operating contracts, notably in Egypt and Libya. Eni is concentrating
energy strategy on exploration and production in China (especially the Tarim
basin) and central Asian areas of the former Soviet Union, where the group
has long cultivated good political contacts.
Eni only became a public joint stock company, with the Treasury as sole
shareholder, in August 1992. But since then Mr Bernabe has divided Eni into
three groups - energy, grouped round Agip; chemicals; and other activities.
'My aim was to reduce Eni from being a loose conglomerate to concentrate on
its core activity of energy,' he said.
This has almost been achieved. Rothschilds recently completed a
pre-privatisation valuation of the group. Mr Bernabe declined to say where
this placed Eni among the international oil majors; but he admitted
hydrocarbons reserves had traditionally been valued very conservatively and
that Eni has an optimal 60/40 mix of oil-to-gas production.
Both the Amato and Ciampi governments pledged to float Agip, as the
initiation of Eni's privatisation, but this never materialised. Since Agip
is the core operating company, Eni as the holding company has been fighting
a discreet battle to ensure it does not end up as an empty shell. The
precise fate of Eni as a holding company remains unclear and Mr Bernabe is
enigmatic on the issue, clearly anxious to avoid prejudicing the Berlusconi
government's opinion.
The impression remains that Mr Bernabe is keen to serve under the new
government and that decisions on privatisation will wait until after the
sale of INA, the state insurance group which is to be privatised at the end
of this month, and Stet, the telecoms holding company which could be sold in
the autumn.

<TEXT>
SME, the Italian retail and catering group which the government is trying to
privatise, increased group net profits last year to L131.6bn (Dollars 81.3m)
from L127.2bn.
Iri, the Italian state holding company, owns 62 per cent of SME.
Iri has already sold off its interests in the group's food activities,
including its main subsidiary Cirio Bertolli De Rica (CBD), but has yet to
find buyers for its GS supermarket chain and its fast-food and motorway
restaurants.
In the last few weeks, Mr Sergio Cragnotti, the controversial Italian
financier, has taken control of CBD from Fisvi, the Apulia farm
co-operative.
Excluding food activities, SME's turnover increased from L3,824bn to
L4,067bn. Retailing sales improved by 6 per cent to L2,782bn, and there was
a 9 per cent increase in restaurant and catering turnover to L1,210bn.
The parent company pushed up profits to L131.9bn, against L93.2bn, to
propose an unchanged dividend of L110 a share.
The company said that the increase in parent company profit was due to a
strong increase in operating profits, and unspecified extraordinary gains
from the sale of smaller subsidiaries.
Net cash increased by L42.6bn to L132.6bn.
A consortium headed by Rinascente, the Italian retail chain, is reported to
be favourite to buy the GS chain.
However, there is speculation about the future of the motorway and fast-food
restaurants. Candidates as diverse as McDonalds, the US fast-food group, and
Forte, the UK catering and hotels company, could be interested, it has been
suggested.

fall

<TEXT>
Profits at Kone, the Finnish elevators group, rose 15.6 per cent in the
first four months as lower financing costs offset a sharp drop in sales and
sluggish markets.
The results, showing profits after financial items rising to FM74m (Dollars
13.4m) from FM64m, reflect the impact of the group's refocusing programme
and weak demand in Europe, which accounts for 80 per cent of turnover. New
elevator deliveries were lower than a year ago and maintenance business was
static.
The group said there was no sign of a revival in European elevator demand.
It looked for growth from non-European markets and a steady development of
maintenance and modernisation business.
Disposals and the difficult elevator market explain the 30 per cent drop in
sales to FM2.5bn from FM3.6bn. The company has sold MacGregor-Navire, a
supplier of shipboard cargo handling equipment, and Kone Cranes, as part of
a focus on its main lift operations. Operating profits sank to FM85m from
FM123m.
The disposals helped cut interest-bearing net debt to FM500m at the end of
April from FM1bn at the end of 1993, reducing financing costs to FM20m from
FM70m. The company wants to sell its remaining non-core activities.
Kone's majority owner, the Herlin family, last month rejected an offer from
Germany's Thyssen group for its entire shareholding. The family controls
about 40 per cent of Kone's capital and 70 per cent of the votes.

<TEXT>
Shareholders in Daimler-Benz will be offered shares in the long-awaited
rights issue at DM640 a share, a discount of 20 per cent to last night's
closing price of DM804.50, the German cars-to-aerospace group announced
yesterday.
The issue will raise just under DM3bn (Dollars 1.8bn) for Daimler-Benz,
making it the biggest rights issue by a German company.
The subscription period for the new shares will be from June 20 to July 5.
The global co-ordinator to the issue is to be Deutsche Bank, the largest
shareholder in Daimler with a 24.4 per cent stake. Senior underwriters are
Dresdner Bank and Commerzbank, with Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch.
Daimler said rights not taken up by existing shareholders would be placed
with international investors. Daimler is the only German company to have a
full listing for its shares on the New York Stock Exchange and Mr Gerhard
Liener, Daimler finance director, has stated that he wanted to use the issue
to raise the percentage of Daimler shares owned by US investors from the
current 7 per cent.
It is understood that Deutsche Bank will maintain its shareholding at its
current level by taking up its rights to new shares.
Other large shareholders include the government of Kuwait, which is thought
likely to maintain its 14 per cent stake, and Stella, a holding company
owned by large German industrial and financial companies which owns 12.6 per
cent.

FT  09 JUN 94 / International Company News: United faces revolt over
employee ownership plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
United Airlines, the biggest carrier in the US, is facing the threat of a
shareholder revolt over its plans to give employees a 55 per cent
controlling stake in the company in exchange for labour concessions.
One of the company's biggest institutional investors, the Pennsylvania-based
Vanguard/Windsor Funds, yesterday said the proposal was against
shareholders' best interests and it would vote against it.
The fund speaks for nearly 10 per cent of United's shares.
A defeat of the employee ownership plan would be devastating for United. The
airline's future strategy for fighting back against competition from
low-cost carriers such as Southwest Airlines depends on the labour
concessions it will produce.
If the plan collapses, United is likely to axe hundreds of unprofitable
short-haul domestic routes and start contracting out services such as
catering and maintenance. The resulting heavy job losses could provoke a
head-on confrontation with the airline's powerful labour unions.
Under the plan drawn up last year, employees were to swap Dollars 4.9bn
worth of labour concessions over the next 12 years for a stake of 53 per
cent to 63 per cent of United's shares, depending on how the share price
performed.
United said the plan was the best hope for the airline, but some
shareholders were concerned that if employees gained control they would put
their own interests ahead of other shareholders'.
That concern grew when United gave in to pressure from the pilots' union
last month and lifted the employees' stake to 55 per cent to compensate them
for a decline in the share price. Vanguard/Windsor Funds said yesterday the
move was the last straw.
United said yesterday it believed the transaction was in shareholders' best
interests. The plan, awaiting approval by the Securities and Exchange
Commission, is expected to be put to a vote later this month or early in
July.

FT  09 JUN 94 / International Company News: Accounting rules for US options
delayed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US accounting rules for stock options granted to executives are being
delayed to consider the issues raised.
The rules, the first part of which was intended to have been introduced at
the end of this year, have provoked a fierce reaction from companies in the
US, particularly smaller ones.
Under a draft issued for comment last summer, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board proposed that companies should disclose more information
about the value of stock options granted to executives, and the cost of the
options to the company should be taken as an expense against profits.
The proposals have angered many fast-growing smaller companies. Unable to
match the salaries and cash bonuses paid by large companies, these companies
seek to attract talented executives by issuing options which give the holder
the opportunity to make big capital gains. If taken as an expense, these
would add substantially to the reported costs of many US companies.
Mr Dennis Berisford, chairman of FASB, said yesterday: 'All the provisions
of the exposure draft, including expense recognition and measurement, will
be reconsidered by the board.'
However, Ms Diana Willis, project manager at FASB for the stock option
rules, said this did not imply that the board was backtracking on the
proposals.
The board always reconsidered all rules after receiving comments from
interested parties, she said.
FASB said it was delaying the first stage of the rules, which would have
required additional disclosure relating to stock options in companies' 1994
financial statements.
The reconsideration of the draft rules is 'not expected to be completed
before the first quarter of 1995', it added. FASB had hoped to publish final
rules by the end of this year.

Smith Institute, has been reappointed for a further year. Christopher Swan,

FT  09 JUN 94 / People: Bob Fisher promoted at TI
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Bob Fisher, 55, chief executive of John Crane, one of TI's three core
businesses, has been appointed managing director, operations, of the TI
Group.
Fisher's new job as TI's effective chief operating officer is part of a
board reshuffle which still leaves unclear who is the front-runner to take
over as chief executive when chairman Sir Christopher Lewinton, 62,
eventually splits his role.
The chief executives of Crane and Bundy, two of TI's three main businesses,
will now report to Fisher, who will be based at TI's London office. He has
been given the task of 'leveraging the resources' of the group across all
its core businesses and will also be responsible for developing TI's
regional strategy for Asia Pacific.
One city analyst suggested that Fisher's appointment indicated that he was
the chief executive designate. However, other analysts disagreed, noting
that Tony Edwards, 49, chief executive of TI's recently acquired Dowty
aerospace business, will continue to report to the chairman. Meanwhile,
Brian Walsh, 50, GKN's former finance director who joined TI just over a
year ago, has been promoted to the new post of vice chairman. Walsh adds
responsibility for the operations of the group's headquarters to his finance
director's role.
Bundy chief executive John Potter, 51, takes over from Fisher as chief
executive of Crane and will move to Crane's Chicago headquarters. Bill
Laule, 45, president of Bundy North America, is moving to the UK to take
over as chief executive of Bundy.
James Roe, 49, director of strategic development for six years, also joins
the TI board, He adds global responsibility for human resources and
communications to his current job.

FT  09 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Turnpyke in black for second half
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Turnpyke Group, the spring manufacturer and property company formerly known
as WB Industries, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 107,000 in the second
half of the 1993 year.
However, it was not enough to overcome first half losses leaving a pre-tax
deficit for the year cut from Pounds 795,000 to Pounds 68,000. Turnover was
down at Pounds 2.45m, against Pounds 6.99m, which included Pounds 4.54m from
discontinued activities.
West Bromwich Spring was the main contributor to the improvement and in the
first five months of the present year it is slightly ahead of its budgeted
profit.
Mr Eric Cater, chairman, said Turnpyke would now be concentrating more on
the property side.
Interest had been shown in its Sheffield properties and terms had been
agreed for the sale of the site but he was not sure when completion would
take place.
Losses per share were 1.21p (12.38p).

FT  09 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Management digs in for north - Two
executives are considering making bids / British Coal, The Bidders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
They cannot both fulfil their ambitions, but British Coal executives Mr Bob
Siddall and Mr Alan Houghton, will take some persuading before they give up
the fight.
Mr Siddall and Mr Houghton, directors of Coal's opencast operations and
northern group respectively, are leading two of three management buy-out
teams considering bids for British Coal assets.
The snag is that both want the central north region; Mr Siddall as part of a
portfolio of three regions comprising the whole of England; Mr Houghton as a
stand-alone company.
A third management team is led by Mr Bryan Riddleston, who wants the south
Wales region. As regional director for the south Wales opencast operations,
he already runs what is on offer.
His problem is that south Wales is thought to be one of the more popular
regions in the privatisation. But at least there is no internal rival to
divide the loyalties of managers and employees.
Senior British Coal executives believe Mr Siddall and Mr Houghton should
reach a deal and join forces. Some doubt the wisdom of either making a bid.
After all, none of the five executive board members have thrown their hats
into the ring in spite of the promise of funds from government to help
managements wishing to stage a buy-out.
A year or two ago, Mr Ray Proctor and Mr Andrew Horsler, now finance and
commercial directors respectively, appeared obvious candidates to be MBO
leaders.
Both are in their 40s, both are widely respected within the industry and
both have chosen to steer through the privatisation of British Coal as
employees of the seller, the government, rather than resign and take the
opportunity to become buyers.
Neither will disclose their reasons but it is common knowledge that British
Coal tried hard to persuade the government to privatise British Coal as one
entity.
Following their failure to win the argument Mr Neil Clarke, British Coal
chairman, has warned repeatedly that there could be casualties after
privatisation as companies compete with each other in buyers' markets.
Mr Siddall's team, which also includes Mr David Brewer, British Coal's head
of finance, is aiming to keep at least the largest part of the corporation
in one piece.
'You need critical mass to manage the environmental and mining risks in this
type of business,' said Mr Siddall.
If his English Coal company were to bid successfully for all three English
regions, it would take control of 15 of British Coal's 16 deep pits mines
still in operation.
Mr Siddall's company is also considering bids for five of the six pits which
have been closed by British Coal in recent months and which are being
offered as stand-alone pits.
Such ambition is perhaps natural in the son of Sir Norman Siddall, who was
considered one of the coal industry's more effective leaders in a career
which culminated in the chairmanship of the National Coal Board, British
Coal's predecessor, in 1982-83.
Mr Bob Siddall, now 49, joined the industry 28 years ago after studying
mining engineering at Nottingham University.
Within three years he was an assistant pit manager and his subsequent career
has included spells as director of north and south Yorkshire. He was
appointed opencast director last September.
He is said to be keen on people management skills. His peers and seniors
consider him a good mining engineer who has yet to prove himself as a top
flight manager.
The number crunching role would be provided by Mr Brewer, 47, who started at
British Coal as a management trainee and was appointed head of finance in
1993. He is highly regarded.
Mr Houghton, whose company is called Northern Coal, and Mr Siddall are said
to have an uneasy relationship.
Mr Houghton, 56, made it to regional director from humble origins, having
started as a miner at 15 in Lancashire. He became a pit deputy eight years
later and an undermanager within another five.
His subsequent career has included spells as chief mining engineer in south
Midlands and director of the Selby group. He became northern director last
September.
He is known for his colourful language. 'He seems to have been trying to
curb his reputation for effing and blinding recently but he is still known
as an arse kicking engineer,' said a colleague.
Critics see him as aggressive and dogmatic. Supporters say that that helps
him to get things done. 'He fights his corner,' said one. 'He has kept pits
open that others would have given up on.'
In south Wales, Mr Riddleston is an enthusiast for the product, mainly high
quality anthracite or 'black diamonds' as he calls it. In his six years
output has almost doubled.
Mr Riddleston, 46, is a chemistry graduate of Wadham College, Oxford. He
joined the industry's operational research establishment in 1970 but later
switched to accountancy within British Coal.
He is admired by some of British Coal's senior executives but not by all the
people who work for him. Neither Mr Peter Weavers, his projects development
manager, nor Mr John Wooliscroft, operations manager, have joined the bid
team.
However Mr Riddleston's company, Celtic Energy, has attracted Mr Mark Thomas
and Mr Eric Blank, regional accountant and marketing specialist
respectively. 'It is the strongest team to win,' he says.

Greencore rise

<TEXT>
Greencore Group, the Irish sugar, malting and milling group, achieved a 15
per cent increase in pre-tax profits to IPounds 19.5m (Pounds 19.03m) for
the half year ended April 1.
The improvement reflected a 54 per cent reducution in net interest charges
to IPounds 2.95m, which Mr Kevin O'Sullivan, finance director, said had been
achieved through strong cash flow, lower working capital requirements and
lower Irish short-term interest rates.
Turnover fell from IPounds 203.54m to IPounds 194.21m, a decline of 4.6 per
cent, while operating profits slipped 6 per cent to IPounds 20.6m partly
because of poor weather conditions in the spring which affected demand for
products from the company's agribusiness division, and difficult trading
conditions in the malting business which saw operating profits in the
malting and flour division fall by 19.5 per cent to IPounds 4m.
Mr Gerry Murphy, chief executive, said the company's sugar and flour
businesses were performing strongly, with sales and operating profits up in
the core Irish market. However, he saw no improvement in the market for malt
'for 12 to 18 months'.
He firmly defended last month's decision to acquire HDM, a Belgian malting
company for IPounds 2.6m, saying that it had 'state-of-the-art' facilities
which would require no additional capital investment and which had been
bought at a knock-down value.
The two plants have a combined 100,000 tonne capacity a year which Mr Murphy
said would be brought on line 'as market conditions permit', starting with
the Benelux countries.
Greencore also announced that it was increasing its stake in Kears, a UK
bakery associate, from 30 per cent to 50 per cent for a consideration of
IPounds 8m.
Mr Murphy said the two investments would have a 'significant impact' on the
group's business by 1995-96. Further acquisitions in the milling and malting
divisions were under review in the EU, central Europe and North America.
At the half year end gearing stood at 41 per cent (77 per cent) and was
expected to drop to 15 per cent by the end of the financial year.
Mr Murphy said Greencore had the financial strength to borrow up to IPounds
100m to fund further acquisitions.
Earnings per share emerged at 19.2p (17p) and the interim dividend is being
lifted to 3.7p (3.3p).
COMMENT
The half-year downturn in operating profits looks largely seasonal and
should not disguise the strong cash flow which is producing healthy earnings
growth and a solid balance sheet. This is a good platform from the
management's expansion plans and earnings per share for the full year of
37p, up 6p, is now easily within reach, giving a prospective p/e of 9.6.
This is lower than some other large stocks in the sector yet Greencore's
potential for growth is somewhat higher than theirs.

FT  09 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Caledonian Mining reveals interest -
British Coal, The Bidders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ministers rejected the advice of Caledonian Mining, among others, that
British Coal should be privatised as a single entity. But that has not
stopped the company, a mining equipment manufacturer, having a look at what
is on offer, writes Michael Smith.
Newark-based Caledonian has qualified to bid for three regions where
opencast operations rather than deep mines predominate: north-east England,
Scotland and south Wales.
Mr Colin MacLeod, chairman and owner, concedes that his company, which turns
over about Pounds 40m a year, is likely to be among the smallest of the
companies considering a bid.
However, he says that turnover has grown steadily since he set up the
company 32 years ago, except at the time of the 1984-85 miners' strike.
Unlike several of the companies considering bids for regions, Caledonian is
debt-free. Mr MacLeod says he already has bank backing for a bid if he
proceeds.
Caledonian operates only one pit, a small drift mine near Abergavenny, in
Wales. However it has long experience working under contract for British
Coal sinking shafts and driving tunnels.
'Extracting coal is the easy bit,' he says.
Manufacturing colliery arches and supports for mines and civil engineering
projects is among the company's other main businesses.
In a submission to the government last year, Caledonian argued strongly
against breaking up British Coal. 'It is doubtful if a coal industry could
survive if it was split into a number of comparatively small units all
competing in a market place dominated by two principal customers.'
This is a reference to National Power and PowerGen, the main electricity
generators in England and Wales.
If successful, Caledonian intends to offer employees shares in the company.
It would seek 'modern' working practices and a no-strike agreement.

FT  09 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Upholstery side hits Airsprung
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits at Airsprung Furniture Group dipped slightly from Pounds
5.96m to Pounds 5.91m in the year to March 31 after problems in its
upholstery division including a large bad debt.
The Wiltshire-based company, the second largest UK bed manufacturer after
Silentnight, described the results 'as less than satisfactory'. Turnover
rose by 11.4 per cent to Pounds 73.1m (Pounds 65.6m) generating operating
profits of Pounds 5.77m (Pounds 5.76m).
A month ago Airsprung warned that its pre-tax result would be below market
expectations. The upholstery division increased turnover by 20 per cent but
Bymacks, its main subsidiary, performed poorly and incurred the bad debt of
about Pounds 250,000.
An investigation revealed management weaknesses, the company said, and
action had been taken.
Airsprung said its bed division performed well with sales up 3.9 per cent in
a very competitive market and a satisfactory increase in profits. 'The
pressure on margins has been pretty acute but we've come out fairly
unscathed,' said Mr John Pierce, chief executive.
Its pine furniture division increased turnover by nearly 16 per cent and he
saw much scope for expansion.
Mr Pierce said there was little sign that the UK recovery had reached the
furniture market. 'We've had to struggle for every increase in turnover with
no help from the economy.' He added: 'However, we are confident that the
group is in a position to take profitable advantage of any upturn in
demand.'
The company intended to increase capital expenditure this year to Pounds
2.1m.
A proposed final dividend of 3.1p gives a total for the year of 4.8p (4.5p
adjusted), covered 3.3 times by earnings per share of 16p (15.7p).

FT  09 JUN 94 / UK Company News: A metamorphosis at Chrysalis - The group's
move into TV and film production
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chrysalis, Mr Chris Wright's music and entertainment group, is in the middle
of a metamorphosis designed to turn it into a major producer of television
programmes and films.
Over the past 12 months, the group has quietly put together a raft of nine
independent production companies, including two existing in-house divisions
covering everything from drama and comedy to arts and sport.
At the same time, Chrysalis, where Mr David Puttnam, the film producer, is
now a non-executive director, has been making film development deals with a
number of UK directors and producers, including Mr Gary Sinyor, director of
Leon the Pig Farmer.
Mr Michael Pilsworth, the former managing director of SelecTV who now heads
the visual entertainment division, says the aim is to develop a range of
production companies in the manner of record labels - usually by taking 50
per cent stakes.
Chrysalis has bought into companies such as: Watchmaker Productions, a
vehicle for Mr Clive James and members of his team at the BBC; Bentley
Productions, which has made dramas such as Harnessing Peacocks; and
Assembly, a company specialising in stand-up comedy.
'That is the end of the buying. We have spent a total, including provision
of working capital, of Pounds 6m,' says Mr Pilsworth, who believes that
access to scarce talent is the key to making money in the coming era of pay
television.
Chrysalis' new move into feature films involves a similar strategy of
backing a roster of British independents, including Mr John Goldstone, the
producer of comedy films such as the Monty Python movies.
There have also been detailed discussions with Mr Richard Holmes and Mr
Stefan Schwartz of Gruber Bros, the makers of Soft Top, Hard Shoulder, and
Mr Jeremy Bolt and Mr Paul Anderson of Impact Pictures, who made the
soon-to-be-released Shopping.
Chrysalis has agreed to invest Pounds 4m over the next three years to fund
the development of new British films, but is now looking for a 50-50 partner
to help take the initiative forward.
The rapid changes at Chrysalis have taken place against a background of
financial difficulty. In the year to August 1993 the company reported
pre-tax losses of Pounds 14.6m on turnover of Pounds 59m, largely because of
problems at MAM, its amusement machine company which has now been disposed
of.
Interim results due todaywill give the first official clue on how well the
restructuring is going. All the signs are that the losses have been greatly
reduced and that the company is now heading towards break-even.
Beside the small but profitable record import-export business, the plan is
to have three main divisions. As well as visual entertainment, the company
will concentrate on commercial radio and music publishing.
The first wholly owned Chrysalis radio station, Heart FM, the new regional
station for the West Midlands, goes on air in September. It will offer 'soft
adult contemporary music' aimed at the 25 to 44-year-old market. Chrysalis
hopes to take the format to London and is applying for one of two new FM
frequencies - although the competition will be fierce.
On top of its music publishing activities, Mr Wright, who sold Chrysalis
Records to Thorn EMI for Dollars 150m (Pounds 100m) in two tranches, has
launched the Echo label to try to build up his record business again.
Last year Pony Canyon, part of Fujisankei of Japan paid Dollars 17.5m for a
25 per cent stake. 'It (Chrysalis Records) took 20 years to build last time.
I think it could probably take 20 again,' says Mr Wright of Echo, which so
far has released only 1,000 copies of work by a band called Zu.
Although Mr Wright is as committed to Chrysalis as ever, he says he is not
determined to hold on to his 51 per cent control. If the price was right, he
says, he would be prepared to sell 15 to 16 per cent of the company.

FT  09 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Hambros climbs to Pounds 90.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hambros, the merchant bank and financial services group, yesterday announced
a 44 percent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 90.5m for the year ended
March 31, 1994, aided by a sharp drop in loan loss provisions and
improvement in the retail financial services division.
Hambros also raised its dividend for the year by seven percent to 15p.
However, the earnings were on the lower end of analysts estimates for the
year and Hambros shares closed 8p lower while shares in other UK merchant
banks generally rose.
Hambros also releaved hidden reserves of Pounds 41m, in line with analysts
estimates, and said it is restating its 1993 balance sheet to eliminate
unrealised investment gains on equity shares in line with recent changes to
accounting practice.
The effect of this change eliminates Pounds 19m which had appeared as an
asset on the balance sheet as of March 1993.
Pre-tax profits from banking activities, at Pounds 76.2m, were only
marginally above the Pounds 73.8m for 1993.
At mid-year, Hambros reported banking profits of Pounds 40.3m. Full year
banking results include a a drop in dealing income to Pounds 44.6m from
Pounds 52.6m.
Analysts attending a company briefing said Hambros had experienced a Pounds
6m loss in bond trading activities in the last quarter of its fiscal year
which contributed to the drop.
The drop in net interest income to Pounds 62.8m from Pounds 75.5m was almost
exclusively attributable to the lower interest rate environment prevailing
which cut the returns available on Hambros' free capital.
However, bad and doubtful debt provisions were sharply reduced for the year
to Pounds 9.4m from Pounds 21.9m in 1993, which aided banking profits.
Also, the bank was aided by a rise in fee and commission income to Pounds
284.8m from Pounds 230m last year.
In other sectors, retail financial services benefitted from the recovery in
Hambro CountryWide.
Overall, the sector contributed Pounds 3.4m to profits after causing a
Pounds 10.7m loss in 1993.
Hambros said it has set aside an undisclosed reserve to cover possible
liabilities from pension transfer business written by its Hambro Guardian
Assurance operation but noted that the full extent of any liability still
cannot be determined.
Direct investments showed a sharp increase in profitability to Pounds 19.6m
from Pounds 8.5m in 1993, mostly from realisations of direct investments. In
general, Treasury and Capital Markets produced satisfactory profits up to
January 31, 1994, although lower than last year. However, in the last two
months of the group's year the markets became highly volatile, particularly
in bond trading where the sharp rises in long-term interest rates, both in
London and New York, reduced profitability.
The group's direct investment business, which has always been an important
part of its activities, had a most active year.
Hambro Countrywide's return to profit in 1993 represented an improvement
over 1992 of more than Pounds 14m, and showed how quickly the group was able
to capitalise on the recovery of the housing market in the earlier part of
the year.

FT  09 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Advance to Pounds 12.7m for Cape
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cape, the building products and industrial services group controlled by
Charter Consolidated, announced a 7 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to
Pounds 12.7m for the year to March 31. This was in spite of a 6 per cent
drop in sales to Pounds 230m.
The profits rise was achie-ved against the background of a modestly
increasing demand for building products in the UK and continental Europe,
the group said. Cape was less optimistic for its industrial businesses,
where the outlook in the UK was uncertain.
Operating profits in the architectural and building products division rose
by 44 per cent to Pounds 9.4m on sales Pounds 200,000 higher at Pounds
71.7m. The return was helped by the elimination of losses in the ceiling
business and higher margins for industrial and insulation products.
The industrial services division fell by 9 per cent to Pounds 6.1m on sales
down 8 per cent to Pounds 159.8m.
The proposed final dividend is 8p (7.75p) for a total 2 per cent ahead at
11p (10.75p). Earnings were 15.8p (14.9p).

FT  09 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Chemring at Pounds 2.85m after exceptional
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROLINE SOUTHEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chemring, the maker of anti-missile chaff, distress rockets and waterproof
clothes, yesterday reported reduced profits in the six months to April 1.
The pre-tax figure fell by 2.3 per cent to Pounds 2.85m (Pounds 2.92m) on
increased turnover of Pounds 24m (Pounds 21.3m).
Operating profits rose by 5.3 per cent from Pounds 2.96m to Pounds 3.12m
after a Pounds 173,000 charge this time for 70 redundancies, mainly at
Pains-Wessex, the distress signals maker.
The pre-tax figure was struck after losses at associated undertakings of
Pounds 100,000 (Pounds 57,000) and net interest charges of Pounds 161,000
(credit Pounds 19,000) because of changes in the Ministry of Defence order
methods which increased pressure on the company's cashflow. Net borrowings
stood at Pounds 1.5m at the half year.
Mr Philip Billington, chairman, said that overall the company was performing
well and had maintained margins. He said the redundancy costs were a one-off
and that the work-in-progress pressure should improve in the second half.
Business from commercial markets had been maintained but orders from the
defence markets, which account for 55 per cent of Chemring's business, were
taking longer to come through.
UK turnover was up 15 per cent at Pounds 10.4m (Pounds 9.04m) while exports
rose 11.3 per cent to Pounds 13.6m (Pounds 12.2m), with better sales in east
Asia, the US and South America.
The interim dividend has been lifted by 8 per cent to 3.24p, compared with
3p from earnings per share which fell from 9.69p to 9.35p basic or to 9.15p
(9.49p) fully diluted.

FT  09 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Scots Hydro seeks southern growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Scottish Hydro-Electric, the power company, is holding discussions about
acquiring power stations from National Power and PowerGen.
Mr Roger Young, Hydro chief executive, said his company wanted to 'push hard
into England' using the strong cash flow from its operations north of the
border. But it was too early to say what the outcome of the talks would be.
The two English generators are required, under an agreement with the
electricity regulator, to sell plant and reduce their generating capacity.
Hydro-Electric also announced a 12 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to
Pounds 164.2m (Pounds 146.4m) for the year to March 31 assisted by strong
growth in electricity sales. Turnover advanced by 10 per cent from Pounds
717.8m to Pounds 792.4m.
Mr Young said that the rise was also helped by last year's expensive
redemption of government debt, and fluctuations in output from the
hydro-electric installations due to wide variations in rainfall.
A final dividend of 8.68p is proposed, making a total for the year of 12.64p
(11.38p), an increase of 11 per cent. Mr Young said the company aimed to
stick to its target of 6-8 per cent real annual dividend growth until the
end of next year.
Increases after that would depend on the outcome of the current regulatory
reviews.
Earnings per share were 31.7p (27.6p).
Total volume of electricity sold rose 22 per cent, helped by a doubling of
sales to Scottish Power as it took its share from the Peterhead power
station, now running on Miller gas from the North Sea.
Sales of electricity in England and Wales were up 9.2 per cent at Pounds
147.5m, equivalent to about a fifth of turnover.
Hydro-Electric already has a share in one power station in operation south
of the border - at Dover - and two more are due to come on stream at
Sellafield and Keadby.
COMMENT
To its credit, Hydro-Electric was keen to emphasise the exceptional nature
of the 15 per cent rise in post-tax earnings. Even so, the underlying rate
was based on solid growth both in its home market in north Scotland, and in
England and Wales where the company has set its sights for long-term growth.
Confirmation that discussions are taking place with the English generators
underlines Hydro's determination to expand south of the border, but no one
expects any quick deals. The longer term prospects depend on Prof
Littlechild's distribution review, though only 20 per cent of its profits
are affected as against 80 per cent at the regional distribution companies.
Hoare Govett has Hydro on a prospective yield of 4.7 per cent, which is a 10
per cent premium to the market as a whole.

FT  09 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Provisions peg Waddington to Pounds 8m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A provision of Pounds 7.4m to settle a US antitrust investigation held back
profits at John Waddington, the packaging, printing and games company.
A further provision of Pounds 3.8m, including Pounds 2.1m of goodwill
written back, on the disposal of a labels business left pre-tax profits for
the year to April 2 at Pounds 8.07m on Pounds 236.1m turnover.
This compares with Pounds 6.05m on turnover of Pounds 221.6m last year, when
there was an exceptional charge of Pounds 9m.
Profits from continuing operations before exceptionals were 5 per cent ahead
from Pounds 20.4m to Pounds 21.5m, on turnover of Pounds 220.3m (Pounds
190.9m).
Earnings per share were 4.33p (3.19p). A final dividend of 4.7p (4.3p) is
proposed, bringing the total for the year to 8.5p (7.9p). Mr Geoff Gibson,
finance director, said that the dividend was almost twice covered by
earnings per share of 16.69p (13.71p) before exceptional items.
Under the antitrust investigation into two of its food services companies
the group has made a plea bargain, agreeing to a fine of USDollars 4.2m
(Pounds 2.8m). The board expects the full provision of Pounds 7.4m to cover
the fine, ensuing civil claims and legal expenses.
The core packaging business raised turnover from Pounds 119.8m to Pounds
145.8m, and operating profits from Pounds 12.8m to Pounds 14.4m. Margins
were just less than 10 per cent.
The strongest growth in the packaging sector came from the food services
division, which sells to US catering companies. Turnover rose from Pounds
28m to Pounds 45.4m, although profits of Pounds 5.4m (Pounds 3.7m) included
Pounds 500,000 of exchange translation gain.
The carton business improved turnover from Pounds 28.9m to Pounds 35.7m,
reflecting greater volumes from blue chip customers such as Birds Eye,
Cadbury, and Colgate.
Mr Gibson said the group would this year invest Pounds 5m in a new
production line at the Leeds factory, which would expand capacity from the
start of next year.
The specialist printing division reported operating profits down from Pounds
4.1m to Pounds 3.7m on turnover of Pounds 48.6m (Pounds 45.4m).
Both turnover and profit in the games division were flat at Pounds 25.9m and
Pounds 3.4m respectively. The group is introducing two new ranges of toys -
radio controlled cars from Japan and infant and pre-school toys from the US
 -which it expects will provide incremental business through its existing
distribution outlets.
COMMENT
Take out the exceptionals and this looks a reasonable set of results,
particularly if you believe the Pounds 7.4m provision for the US antitrust
investigation is sufficient. The investigation appears to have done no
damage to the expanding food services division. The group has also seen
strong growth in the UK cartons sector, where its margins of 13.2 per cent
are among the best. Pencilled in profits of about Pounds 22m would give a
multiple of about 12. This is a worthwhile discount to the sector -
providing there are no more exceptional charges.

FT  09 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Evans Halshaw acquires Davenport for Pounds
33m and makes Pounds 29m cash call
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Evans Halshaw, Solihull-based motor distributor, has made a recommended
Pounds 32.6m offer for Davenport Vernon, the motor dealer, and is raising
Pounds 29m via a 3-for-10 rights issue priced at 425p.
The merger of Davenport's 28 dealerships with the Evans' 58 represents a
further consolidation in the motor distribution sector and comes two weeks
after BSG International bid Pounds 20m for Jessups.
Some 50.5 per cent of the Davenport equity has been committed to Evans which
is offering 100 new shares for every 288 Davenport shares or a cash
alternative of 155p. The share offer values each Davenport share at 172p,
which is a premium of 52 per cent over the overnight price.
At yesterday's close Davenport was up 45p at 158p while Evans fell 31p to
484p.
The proceeds of the rights - underwritten by Kleinwort Benson - will fund
the cash alternative and, unless there is unexpected reluctance to accept
Evans paper, also pay for the Pounds 7m acquisition of a private motor
dealing company, the future of which is subject to negotiations.
Evans has made no secret of its desire for acquisitions and has had a
lengthy courtship with Davenport.
'We've had close connections for three years and have had discussions on a
number of occasions,' said Mr Geoff Dale, Evans chairman.
Davenport had a rights issue last year but a profits warning last March
indicated a weakening financial position and this opened the way for the
offer.
Yesterday the company announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 478,000 for the
six months to March 31 on a turnover of Pounds 88m.
It is paying an interim dividend of 0.5p.
Evans expects to be able to extract higher performance and wider margins
from the Davenport chain of dealerships. Its dealerships in counties on the
north-west side of London complement Evans' geographical strength in the
Midlands and south-east England.
Evans yesterday forecast an interim dividend of 5p for 1994. This represents
an increase of about 15 per cent over last year and it is intended that it
will be 33 per cent of the total.
Kleinwort Benson acted for Evans in the takeover and NatWest Securities for
Davenport.
COMMENT
Evans Halshaw shareholders can thank institutional reluctance to buy motor
distributor shares and market fatigue with capital raising for an
advantageously priced rights. The shares anyway have come off their high
point for the year just as profits are set to jump sharply. The combined
Evans Halshaw-Davenport Vernon group should make Pounds 15m pre-tax this
year and that would give earnings on the enlarged capital of about 35p a
share. That would put the new shares on a prospective multiple of just over
12, which should not be a very severe test of loyalty.

FT  09 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Eldridge Pope trebled to Pounds 0.6m in
first half
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REG VAUGHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Eldridge Pope, Dorchester-based brewer, retailer and wine shipper, is
keeping up the pace of profit expansion in the first half of 1993-94 with a
trebled pre-tax figure and Mr Christopher Pope, chairman, said that the main
benefits of the recent Carlsberg-Tetley trading alliance were yet to come.
Profits for the half year to March 31 rose from Pounds 203,000 to Pounds
606,000 pre-tax after a sharp drop in net interest payable to Pounds 570,000
(Pounds 895,000).
For the year to September 1993 pre-tax profits doubled to Pounds 1.76m.
The USM-traded company, whose beer brands include Thomas Hardy Country and
Royal Oak, recently introduced a brew called 3D (Dorchester D-Day Bitter).
Turnover declined to Pounds 17.3m (Pounds 20.5m), reflecting the sale of the
beer wholesaling business to Carlsberg.
Trading profits rose to Pounds 1.31m (Pounds 1.24m) representing an increase
from 6.1 per cent to 7.6 per cent in the mar-gin.
Mr Jeremy Pope, managing director, said the Pounds 5m net from the Carlsberg
deal was a 'war chest' waiting to be used. He said that a number of
opportunities were being pursued but the board was 'setting a stringent
hurdle race.'
Earnings per share rose from 0.86p to 2.3p and the interim dividend is
increased to 1.5p (1.4p).

FT  09 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Chemring at Pounds 2.85m as overheads rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROLINE SOUTHEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chemring, the maker of anti-missile chaff, distress rockets and waterproof
clothes, yesterday reported reduced profits in the six months to April 1,
writes Caroline Southey.
The pre-tax figure fell by 2.3 per cent to Pounds 2.85m (Pounds 2.92m) on
increased turnover of Pounds 24m (Pounds 21.3m).
Operating profits rose by 5.3 per cent from Pounds 2.96m to Pounds 3.12m
after a Pounds 173,000 charge this time for 70 redundancies, mainly at
Pains-Wessex, the distress signals maker. There was also a 16 per cent rise
in other overheads to Pounds 4.49m (Pounds 3.87m) following the acquisition
of Alloy Surfaces in the US.
The pre-tax figure was struck after losses at associated undertakings of
Pounds 100,000 (Pounds 57,000) and net interest charges of Pounds 161,000.
The interim has been lifted by 8 per cent to 3.24p, compared with 3p, from
earnings per share which fell from 9.69p to 9.35p basic.

FT  09 JUN 94 / UK Company News: LIG's Pounds 175m loss part of a 'sorry'
set of numbers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Even its new finance director, Mr James Tyrrell, could only describe London
International Group's results for the year to March 31, which accompanied
its Pounds 115.2m rights issue, as a 'sorry' set of numbers.
He said he had prepared the results on a conservative basis, for instance
writing off costs previously deferred or capitalised, and switching the
Indian joint venture, in which LIG has a 42.7 per cent stake, from a
subsidiary to an associate.
Group turnover fell 4.7 per cent to Pounds 396.6m (Pounds 416m) as health
and personal products sales fell. Operating profits were Pounds 40m lower at
Pounds 7.5m before exceptional losses. These included Pounds 30.9m of
operating exceptional losses costs of surplus property, and a Pounds 137.4m
restructuring charge which includes a Pounds 91.4m loss on the sale of the
photo-processing division.
Interest charges fell slightly to Pounds 14.3m (Pounds 15m), thanks to lower
interest rates and in spite of a more than Pounds 40m rise in debt to Pounds
168.4m.
That left the pre-tax loss at Pounds 175.1m (profit Pounds 27.8m). However,
after a tax credit of Pounds 200,000 and a minorities credit of Pounds 1.2m,
the transfer from reserves was Pounds 173.7m (retained profit Pounds 2.8m).
The loss per share was 102.93p (earnings 11.12p).
Mr Tyrrell said the sale of ColourCare had been unusually complex. LIG had
originally received an attractive offer from an American group but the
interests of the small number of large players in the industry had prevented
this succeeding.
The sale to the MBO does not cover the 257 mini-labs in Boots stores, but
LIG was close to selling these to two parties, Mr Tyrrell said.
In the latest financial year ColourCare lost Pounds 13.2m (Pounds 3.2m)
before exceptional costs and interest.
The health and personal products division, including condoms, surgical
gloves, household and industrial gloves and toiletries, suffered a drop in
pre-exceptional operating profits from Pounds 51.4m to Pounds 20.7m. This
was partly due to a change to a smoother pattern of promotions, but also
reflected problems in Italy, cost increases exceeding price rises, and a
lack of one-off gains in the previous year.
The deficit on the profit and loss account hit the balance sheet, cutting
net assets from Pounds 121.5m to a deficit of Pounds 10.7m, after crediting
reserves with Pounds 47.8m of goodwill previously written off.
Mr Tyrrell said that after the rights issue, debt would fall immediately to
Pounds 53.2m, 50.9 per cent of the enhanced shareholders funds. However,
cash costs of the restructuring would increase debt once more to an
indicated Pounds 82.1m, giving gearing of 78.6 per cent.

FT  09 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Standard Life exercises Halifax option
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Standard Life, the Edin-burgh-based life insurance company, said yesterday
that it had exercised its option to buy the joint venture investment company
it had formed with Halifax Building Society.
Halifax last year made a decision to end its tied relationship with Standard
Life under which it sold Standard Life's retail financial products
exclusively.
That agreement formally comes to an end in January 1995, but Standard Life
said it was making the announcement of the purchase now 'to allay any
uncertainty among existing and new investors about the ongoing investment
management of their savings.'
The joint venture company, which manages the investment of two unit trusts -
Income Advantage and Global Advantage - has 68,000 customers and funds of
more than Pounds 300m under management.

FT  09 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Exceptionals leave Anglo United Pounds 75m
in the red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Losses at Anglo United, the heavily indebted owner of the Coalite smokeless
fuel business, rose from Pounds 30.5m to Pounds 74.6m pre-tax in the year to
end-March, but the bulk of the deficit arose from the sale of the
Charringtons Fuel business in March.
The company showed a marginal improvement in its operating performance, and
Mr Harold Cottam, chairman, said Anglo United was exploring the possibility
of bidding for parts of the British Coal privatisation.
It is interested in Coal Products, a manufacturer of smokeless fuel, and
British Fuels, a distributor of coal, gas and oil, which both complement
Anglo United's existing business. However, these acquisitions would be
contingent upon further financial restructuring.
Mr Cottam said: 'We believe that Anglo's period of retrenchment is now
over.' It has almost completed a programme of asset disposals, following a
debt for equity swap with its leading bankers.
Net debt has been reduced by Pounds 32.8m to Pounds 96.1m, but the company
has an additional Pounds 24.9m in convertible loan stock and Pounds 56m in
deep discount loan notes. About Pounds 103m of its bank debt is repayable in
March 1996 making further restructuring inevitable.
Turnover was Pounds 518.5m (Pounds 544.7m) and operating profits before
exceptional items amounted to Pounds 21.9m (Pounds 20.3m). The company
suffered Pounds 11.9m of exceptional losses, primarily related to the
closure of one of Coalite's two production plants, in Grimethorpe.
The sale of Charringtons resulted in a book profit Pounds 14m, but it took a
Pounds 75.7m exceptional loss from goodwill previously written off.
Interest costs fell 28 per cent to Pounds 23.5m, due to the impact of
disposals, and Mr Cottam was confident that operating profit would exceed
interest payments in the current year. Losses amounted to 8.3p (8.9p).
Staff levels have been reduced from 3,000 to below 1,800, and with reduced
costs, Anglo United increased profits from smokeless fuels despite a 4.5 per
cent fall in domestic sales. However, earnings from Coalite chemicals fell.
COMMENT
At its peak, in 1990-1991, Anglo United made profits of more than Pounds
15m, but with its current structure, such levels are no longer attainable.
It should achieve a marginal profit for the current year, but future
earnings growth is restricted by the shrinking Coalite market. Having swept
the decks, the management wants to sail forth and explore opportunities for
capitalising on its expertise. If it succeeds, shareholders face significant
dilution from another debt-for-equity swap. If it fails, the company retains
a substantially negative value. Either way, the odds seem stacked against
the equity shareholder.

FT  09 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Acquisition helps Blick rise 14% to Pounds
4.98m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Pounds 57.6m acquisition last October of Time and Security from Mercury
Communicat-ions helped Blick, the communications systems and time products
company, lift interim profits by 14 per cent and turnover by 48 per cent.
Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 4.37m to Pounds 4.98m in the six months to
end March, while turnover increased from Pounds 16.3m to Pounds 24m.
Operating profits were 31 per cent ahead at Pounds 5.34m.
The company attributed Pounds 5.8m of the increase in turnover to the
acquisition, and 10 per cent to organic growth.
Mr Ian Scott-Gall, managing director, said Blick had produced a strong
cashflow following a cleverly structured acquisition which was on course.
During the half year the group paid back Pounds 14m of bank debt incurred in
the purchase, reducing gearing from 167 per cent to 81 per cent.
He described the current level of business as encouraging, with a high level
of customer confidence in the market.
The Time division, responsible for clocking in equipment, car parks and time
control software systems, showed strong growth and good margins.
Operating profit rose from Pounds 1.26m to Pounds 2.42m on turnover up from
Pounds 6.78m to Pounds 9.24m.
The Communications division, where margins are more competitive, increased
turnover from Pounds 9.52m to Pounds 14.8m, and profits from Pounds 2.82m to
Pounds 2.92m.
Net interest payable rose to Pounds 359,000 compared with interest
receivable last time of Pounds 293,000.
Earnings per share increased to 12.54p from 12.42p. The interim dividend is
3.5p (3.3p).

FT  09 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Helene rights to help fund Pounds 10m
Reggie acquisition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROLINE SOUTHEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Helene, the fashion wear manufacturer and distributor, yesterday announced a
Pounds 8.9m rights issue to help fund the Pounds 10m proposed acquisition of
Reggie, a supplier of women's outerwear.
Some 41.8m ordinary shares are to be issued at 24p on a 1-for-3 basis.
The initial consideration of Pounds 4.5m for Reggie will be satisfied by
Pounds 2.9m in cash and loan notes and the balance by the issue of 6m shares
to Reggie's vendors.
The further Pounds 5.5m will be payable so long as Reggie's aggregate
pre-tax profits for the two financial years to December 31 1995 exceed
Pounds 4m.
Reggie, which last year reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.56m on turnover
of Pounds 16.4m, primarily supplies large high street retailers with its
own-designed women's coats, jackets and separates.
Helene reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.51m in 1993 on turnover of
Pounds 101.6m, 56 per cent of which was generated by women's wear.
Mr Norman Fetterman, Helene managing director, said Reggie operated in
markets complementary to those of Helene and that the acquisition would
'strengthen our position as a key supplier to major high street retailers
and mail-order companies.'
The Helene board said it hoped to raise a total of Pounds 14.9m, Pounds 6.4m
of which would be used to meet the cash element and part of the loan note
element of the acquisition and Pounds 8.5m as additional working capital.
Mr Fetterman said a larger capital base was needed to expand the company at
a time when retailers were beginning to do business with key suppliers only.
Apart from the rights issue, the board proposed that an additional Pounds 6m
would be raised by the subscription of 24.3m ordinary Helene shares (about
12.3 per cent of the enlarged ordinary share capital) by Causeway Smaller
Quoted Companies Fund.
The rights issue has been fully underwritten by Samuel Montagu.

FT  09 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Confident Meyer rises to Pounds 42m - Sales
currently 13% ahead and benefits of cost cuts coming through
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fears that the UK economy might be overheating were dismissed yesterday by
Meyer International, the timber and building products group, which said it
had perceived only modest and steady growth over the last year.
Mr John Dobby, who took over as chief executive following the departure of
Mr Richard Jewson in September, said he had seen no evidence of inflation
getting out of control. 'We are seeing a steady recovery and the pace of
that recovery is not accelerating,' he said.
Sales were running 13 per cent ahead of last year, against a 9 per cent
increase for the whole of 1993. Yet they were still substantially lower than
the peaks of the 1980s.
Mr Dobby was speaking at the announcement of the results for the year ended
March 31 1994, which showed a better-than-expected profits improvement from
Pounds 14.4m to Pounds 41.6m.
Sales were 10 per cent higher at Pounds 1.2bn.
Benefits were being seen from two years of cost-cutting, following the
ill-fated move into plumbing and heating in the late 1980s.
With costs across the group rising 6 per cent compared with the 10 per cent
sales increase, much of the turnover improvement had dropped straight to
profits.
The UK builders merchant business, Jewson, improved operating profits by 78
per cent on an 8 per cent increase in sales to Pounds 425m. Sales on a
like-for-like basis rose by 9 per cent, including a 4 per cent price
increase.
Forest products benefited from a 10 per cent increase in softwood prices
over the year. Profits rose by 63 per cent to Pounds 19.6m on sales 21 per
cent higher at Pounds 389.5m.
The Dutch business returned operating profits of Fl 36.7m, 47 per cent ahead
of last year.
Meyer's debt as a proportion of shareholders' funds fell from 50 per cent to
19 per cent, largely because of the Pounds 70m cash call last year.
The final dividend, cut from 16.5p last year, was increased by 18 per cent
to 6.6p, for a total 12.5 per cent up at 10.8p. Earnings more than doubled
from 10.1p to 24p.
Also announced was the appointment of Mr Richard Miles, ex-md of Steetley,
as a non-executive director.
COMMENT
Meyer is doing everything possible to regain the investment community's
favour. It stresses caution and is focusing on organic growth. Yet it
remains shadowed by its former ambitions. News that Meyer is thinking about
returning to plumbing and heating, albeit more cautiously through specialist
counters in its branches, left many feeling somewhat stunned. The economic
recovery will give great momentum to profits but, in the longer term, this
is more of management play. Given its recent history, the jury is still out.
Forecasts are for Pounds 57m, with a prospective p/e of 14 times.

FT  09 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Invesco to launch Japanese investment trust
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Invesco has announced plans for a Japanese investment trust, the third new
trust to be launched in the sector this year. The Invesco Japan Discovery
Trust will aim for long-term capital growth by concentrating on smaller
companies.
The Japanese investment trust sector has been attracting substantial inflows
of new money this year. Fidelity Japanese Values, a smaller companies trust,
raised Pounds 105m, and a conversion share issue by Fleming Japanese pulled
in Pounds 160m. Schroders has so far raised Pounds 88m for its Japan Growth
fund, the public offer for which closes at the end of the month.
Invesco already runs two Japanese unit trusts, and will draw on the
experience of its existing Tokyo-based fund managers for the new trust.
Shares will be issued at 100p, with one warrant attached to every five
shares. The public offer opens on July 14 and closes on July 29.

fund
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Framlington, the fund manager, is seeking to raise up to Dollars 50m (Pounds
33.3m) for an institutional fund investing in Morocco and Tunisia.
The Framlington Maghreb fund, to be listed in Dublin, is being marketed
throughout Europe and the US and will close at the end of June.
Framlington and Banque Commerciale du Maroc, Morocco's largest private bank,
are partners in the venture, and the International Finance Corporation is
also expected to take a stake.
At least two-thirds of the capital will be invested in Morocco, with the
balance in Tunisia. The focus is on companies quoted on local stock markets
with about 25 per cent of the capital earmarked for pre-flotation finance.

FT  09 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Private broadcaster bids for Chiltern
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CLT, one of Europe'a largest private broadcasters, yesterday made its first
big push into the UK market with a recommended offer for Chiltern, the
commercial radio company, in a deal that values the company at Pounds 16.9m.
Chiltern's shares closed 33p higher at 238p yesterday.
Since the closure of Radio Luxembourg CLT has had little official presence
in the UK although it owns 80 per cent of Atlantic 252 which transmits from
Ireland to more than 66 per cent of the UK population.
Luxembourg-based CLT, which manages 13 radio stations and eight television
stations in continental Europe has been trying to get into the UK for some
time.
In the year ending September 30 Chiltern, which broadcasts in the northern
Home Counties showed losses of Pounds 246,000 on a turnover of Pounds 5.8m,
and yesterday announced a pre-tax profit of Pounds 10,000 on a turnover of
Pounds 2.7m for the six months to the end of March.
CLT is offering 242p in cash, representing a premium of 18.3 per cent over
the Chiltern price at the close of business on June 7. Holders of 15.35 per
cent have agreed to accept the offer.
The Daily Mail and General Trust which last week bought a package of radio
stocks, including an 18.5 per cent stake in Chiltern, was last night
reviewing its position.
Apart from its local licences Chiltern has a 25 per cent stake in Network
News (Radio) which provides a 24-hour radio news service to both local
stations and Virgin Radio. It also won the Severn Estuary licence, one of
five new regional commercial stations which launch in September.
For CLT the Chiltern purchase,if it goes ahead, would fill in large
stretches of the UK not reached by Atlantic 252.

FT  09 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Racal dives but bullish on outlook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Racal Electronics, the data communications, radio and network services
group, yesterday reported an expected sharp decline in full year pre-tax
profits, but promised 'a very substantial' improvement in performance this
year.
The bullish comments about the outlook prompted a 10p rise in the share
price to 248p.
Racal also announced the sale of the remainder of the Racal-Redac
computer-aided design business to Japan's Zuken for Pounds 13m in cash.
Pre-tax profits for the year to March 31 fell by 44.7 per cent, from Pounds
47.7m to Pounds 26.4m, after Pounds 19.6m of previously disclosed losses on
the disposal or closure of operations and acquisition goodwill written off.
Earnings per share fell to 5.47p (10.24p) and a proposed final dividend of
2.75p makes an unchanged 4.25p total.
Turnover from continuing operations slipped to Pounds 887m (Pounds 908.9m)
and discontinued operations contributed a further Pounds 29.1m (Pounds 38m).
Trading profits from continuing operations declined to Pounds 50.1m (Pounds
54.3m).
Sir Ernest Harrison, chairman, said the data communications business had
been badly affected by the recession in continental Europe and by the late
availability of new products from the US operations. Data communications'
operating profits fell to Pounds 3.49m (Pounds 12.6m) on turnover of Pounds
373.8m (Pounds 370.6m).
However, Sir Ernest predicted that recent events in the division, including
the appointment of Mr Martin Richardson to take charge of the business,
would improve results.
Specifically, he forecast that in the current year the data communications
division would achieve profit margins of 'well over 5 per cent on sales of
over Pounds 400m,' and he said margins the following year should increase to
more than 7.5 per cent with further revenue growth.
'With this significantly higher profit contribution from data communications
coupled with improved performances by radio communications, specialised
businesses and defence radar and avionics, the results for the year 1994-95
will show a very substantial improvement.'
COMMENT
Once again Racal is promising jam tomorrow. Delivering on the promises
depends mostly on revitalising the core data communications business. Mr
Richardson plans to cull the product line and identified Pounds 10m of
savings. Meanwhile, the networks businesses will benefit from the National
Lottery traffic even though the real gains from being part of the Camelot
consortium will not come through until 1995-96. Racal should report pre-tax
profits of about Pounds 70m this year, equivalent to earnings of about
15.9p. After yesterday's rise the stock is trading on a prospective p/e of
15.6. Hold.

FT  09 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Daily Mail Trust rises 14% to Pounds 24m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Daily Mail and General Trust, yesterday produced pre-tax profits 14 per
cent higher at Pounds 24m and made an upbeat forecast that it was responding
well to 'the general improvement in the economy and in the advertising
markets in particular.'
Trading profits for the half year to April 3 increased by Pounds 6.8m to
Pounds 43.2m before exceptional items. Turnover rose to Pounds 368.3m
(Pounds 329.1m), with the group's three main newspapers, the Daily Mail,
Mail on Sunday and the Evening Standard - all with new supplements -
performing well, mainly because of increasing advertising revenues.
The Evening Standard's important classified business grew by 15 per cent.
Northcliffe Newspapers, the company's regional group, also increased
profits, although the revenue increase was not consistent across the
country.
Mr Derek Terrington, publishing analyst at stockbrokers Kleinwort Benson
said yesterday: 'Essentially this was a good trading performance on a rising
advertising market.'
Earnings per share rose from 12.1p to 13p or from 16.8p to 21.2p adjusted
before exceptionals.
The interim dividend has been increased by 11 per cent to 4p (3.6p).
The strong performance in the core newspaper business was not generally
mirrored in the company's other media activities.
As already announced, the DMGT faces an up to Pounds 20m share for the full
year of losses from Whittle Communications and Whittle Schools in the US.
One Whittle television network has had to be closed down and there are
considerable development costs at Medical News Network. A total of Pounds
12.2m will be charged in the accounts.
Development costs will also be incurred setting up Channel One, a new
television channel aimed at the cable television market in London.
The company said yesterday that the early losses 'should not exceed Pounds
40m in total' - Pounds 10m lower than earlier speculation.
The shares rose 33p yesterday to close at Pounds 12.13p.
COMMENT
The company's main newspaper businesses continue to forge ahead underpinned
by a commendable commitment to invest in editorial. The questions begin to
arise when the company strays away from print into the electronic media. It
was involved in the successful - and profitable - teletext franchise bid,
but has tended to come second in a number of commercial radio and television
contests. The losses at Whittle flow from a move from print to electronic
ommunication. The cable channel is clearly a long-term venture that will hit
short-term results. Analysts are looking for about Pounds 85m before
exceptionals for the full year and a bit over Pounds 100m for next year.
Next year's forecast of 65p earnings per share would give a 50 per cent
premium to the market.

FT  09 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Enterprise elaborates on logic in Lasmo bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Enterprise Oil yesterday sought to meet criticisms over its Pounds 1.3bn bid
for rival explorer Lasmo with a letter to the target's shareholders setting
out the logic behind both a takeover and the unusually structured all-paper
offer.
It comes just two days before Lasmo is expected to announce an independent
valuation of its own assets as its final shot in the bid battle. Under
takeover rules, Lasmo may release no new information after Friday.
The valuation has been done by DeGolyer &amp; McNaughton, a leading US petroleum
consultant. It is likely to show a net asset value per share of
substantially more than the offer value of 126p based on last night's 137p
close for Lasmo and 391p for Enterprise.
Enterprise's commercial argument, meanwhile, is based on the assumption that
the risk and reward profile of exploration/production companies must be
smoothed out to ensure a steady return to shareholders.
By combining the two companies, shareholders would see benefits from
complementary assets in the North Sea and abroad; greater recovery from the
maturing North Sea through joint geological knowledge; an increased
potential to swap assets; accelerated exploitation of assets in south east
Asia; and a strong balance sheet.
Enterprise also argues that the enlarged company would have improved chances
of profitable exploration through the use of Lasmo's facilities in Liverpool
Bay.
Enterprise sought to clear up questions over its complicated all paper offer
 -which comprises 27 A shares with limited dividend rights and 12 warrants
for every 80 Lasmo shares. The offer included tradeable warrants, the group
said, 'to reflect the difference in dividends between the A shares and the
Enterprise ordinary shares'.
Lasmo rejected Enterprise's commercial arguments as flawed. 'I think their
statement that we have complementary assets means we have different assets,'
said Mr Joe Darby, chief executive.
Lasmo said Enterprise was also wrong in claiming it could benefit from
Lasmo's Liverpool Bay infrastructure. 'They would have the same access and
pay the same tariffs whether or not they owned Lasmo. How is value added
here?' asked Mr Rudolf Agnew, chairman.
Lasmo challenged Enterprise to follow its example in valuing the assets
behind the all-paper bid. 'We have come up with a value for our paper. The
only way they can prove their offer is fair value is if they do the same,'
an adviser said.

FT  09 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Strong UK sales growth as Electrocomponents
rises 40%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Strong UK sales growth helped Electro-components, the electronic, electrical
and mechanical components distribution group, report a 40 per cent increase
in pre-tax profits for the year to March 31.
Profits were Pounds 72.7m, against Pounds 51.9m after net losses of Pounds
7m on disposals. Earnings per share were 22.9p (19.3p) and a proposed final
dividend of 7p makes a total of 9.5p (7.9p). The shares closed 12p higher at
487p.
Sir Keith Bright, who steps down after five years as chairman next month,
said the results reflected 'the start of the climb out of recession in
Australia, Ireland and particularly the UK.'
Turnover increased by 2.3 per cent to Pounds 396.5m (Pounds 387.5m).
Excluding the effect of the disposal of the lossmaking Misco businesses the
previous year, turnover grew by 14 per cent and operating profits increased
by 16 per cent to Pounds 69.9m (Pounds 60.1m).
Sales in RS Components' UK division increased by 12.2 per cent to Pounds
279.6p as the group extended its catalogue range and boosted market share.
RS International's sales grew by 35 per cent to Pounds 79.9m despite the
difficult trading conditions and showed a profit underlining the progress
made by the group's expanded continental European operations. Sales at Pact
International fell by 3 per cent to Pounds 37m giving a Pounds 300,000 loss.
The strong cash generation of the RS business in the UK resulted in a Pounds
20.6m increase in net cash to Pounds 57.4m over the year.
COMMENT
The results were slightly ahead of expectations and serve to highlight the
strong performance of the core distribution business in the UK and the
success of the group's focused strategy. The push into overseas markets is
continuing with a new joint venture in India and the strengthening of
distribution partnerships in Europe, the middle east and east Asia. This
overseas expansion, particularly the start-up operations in Europe, should
drive earnings forward well into the next decade. Meanwhile the cash
balances will be used to support organic growth including a Pounds 35m
investment over the next two years in a new warehouse in Nuneaton. This year
pre-tax profits of about Pounds 83m look possible producing earnings of 26p
and putting the shares on a deserved multiple of 18.7.

FT  09 JUN 94 / US investor group set to buy Heron
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY and RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A group of investors led by Mr Steven Green, the US businessman, was
yesterday selected by Heron International as the preferred buyer of Mr
Gerald Ronson's property company. The bid from HNV Acquisition would give Mr
Ronson and the Heron management team a continuing role.
Mr Green, chairman of Astrum International, the US company which owns the
Samsonite brand, and of Auburndale Properties said yesterday that he planned
to retain the group's assets and to develop it into a larger European
property company.
HNV is a limited partnership and includes as investors Mr Rupert Murdoch,
chairman of News International, Mr Terry Semel, chairman of Warner Brothers,
Mr Craig McCaw, chairman of McCaw Cellular Communications, and trusts of Mr
Michael Milken's family.
Mr Green said he had been watching Heron for some time and invested in its
bonds a year ago. He believes Heron's problems stem not from its selection
of properties but from the impact of recession on asset values.
'The exact role that Mr Ronson and his team would play is not structured,
but I would hope we will have an opportunity to deal with them and to use
their knowledge and their expertise on these assets. I would look to a
relationship that would be longer than an interim basis,' he said.
Heron had been in talks with a short list of six bidders, but the offer from
Mr Green's group was understood to be the highest. Heron said it would
notify the other parties that it would be 'terminating discussions with them
with immediate effect'.
Although yet to be finalised, the offer from HNV will enable lenders to the
Heron group to convert their debt into equity and so retain an interest. A
cash alternative will give an exit for other lenders, and HNV will take a
majority of the equity.
Lenders expect to receive offers reflecting the last prices at which the
group's debt and equity traded. That would give holders of senior debt
around 45p in the pound, substantially higher than the proposal from a
consortium led by Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, which is believed
to have been under 35p.
Heron is reckoned to have asset backing of 70p in the pound for its Pounds
300m of senior debt, although in a receivership senior lenders might expect
to get 30p. Junior bondholders might expect to be offered around 6p in the
pound, while equity holders have seen their shares quoted at around 1 1/2 p.
HNV is being advised by Swiss Bank Corporation, while Heron's adviser is
UBS.

FT  09 JUN 94 / Price war hits small shops says Northern
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Northern Foods, the UK dairy and foods manufacturer, warned yesterday that
the fall in UK food prices - caused by the supermarket price war - was set
to continue.
Mr Christopher Haskins, chairman, reporting a small improvement in full-year
pre-tax profits to Pounds 157.2m, said: 'In the short term, I can see no
let-up in price deflation. I suspect low inflation will be an element in the
food industry for the foreseeable future. This means the industry may be
going in the opposite direction from the economy.'
He said food deflation, the first the UK had experienced since the 1930s,
was running at around 2 per cent. Since the country entered the Common
Market in 1972, food inflation had averaged 10-15 per cent a year.
As a result of aggressive price-cutting by the big supermarkets, Northern's
doorstep deliveries of milk fell 12 per cent over the year, while van
deliveries of food to small shops dropped 15 per cent. But sales to its four
biggest customers - Marks &amp; Spencer, Sainsbury, Tesco and Safeway - rose 6
per cent, and now accounted for 34 per cent of group turnover. Sales to
Marks &amp; Spencer showed their biggest ever rise in volume, though not in
value.
Mr Haskins said that despite the sharp fall in home milk sales - likely to
be repeated this year - the system of doorstep delivery in the UK was not
under immediate threat. 'I'm more concerned about small shops,' he said.
'There could be serious social problems if there are no small shops in this
country, and the way things are going there won't be any.'
Despite the price war, he said, 'I see no reason why our record of
continuous growth should be in jeopardy this year.'
On sales up 1 per cent at Pounds 2.05bn, operating profits fell 1 per cent
to Pounds 178.8m. Operating profits from dairy were Pounds 88.9m (Pounds
92.0m), from convenience foods Pounds 45.6m (Pounds 44.4m), from meat
products Pounds 18.0m (Pounds 20.2m) and from grocery products Pounds 26.3m
(Pounds 24.2m).
Lower interest costs left pre-tax profits up 2.6 per cent at Pounds 157.2m.
Earnings per share were up 2.1 per cent at 20.51p, while the dividend was
raised 4.8 per cent to 8.8p, after a 5.3p final. Northern's shares rose 4p
to 212p.

FT  09 JUN 94 / Andersen ascends the UK accountancy ladder: Annual fee
income and the rise and rise of a humble junior
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is one clear trend that stands out in the annual fee income results of
the UK's largest accountancy firms published this week: the ascendancy of
Andersen.
Two years ago, Andersen - comprising Arthur Andersen and Andersen Consulting
 -was a humble junior, a clear number six among the 'Big Six' firms with
income of Pounds 331m. In its latest results for the year to March 31 it has
jumped to number three at Pounds 434m.
The leap up the league table is nothing new. Ten years ago Andersen was
merely the ninth largest firm in the UK. While most of its rivals have
reported absolute declines or modest growth during the recessionary last
three years, it has continued to report double-digit increases.
At the other end of the scale, the latest fee income figures do not look
impressive for Touche Ross. Ernst &amp; Young was edged down to fourth place by
Andersen, in turn pushing down Price Waterhouse to fifth. Both reported
modest growth.
But Touche did more than simply slide down because of pressure from above.
It reported an absolute decline in fee income of 0.8 per cent to Pounds
333m. The result says much about the end of the counter-cyclical income the
firms have generated from insolvency work during the recession.
In the briefest of the statements from the six firms when they published
their results on Monday, Mr John Roques, Touche's senior partner, said
simply: 'I am pleased that we have approximately maintained revenues during
the last year.'
Mr George Westropp, a partner with the firm, says the decline is a
readjustment following the enormous growth generated by a number of
insolvency assignments: notably the administration of Polly Peck
International and the liquidation of the Bank of Credit and Commerce
International. The big fees on these jobs have now ended, and there is
little prospect of anything filling the gaps.
'BCCI was the largest professional assignment anywhere in the world ever,'
he says. The most recent report last month showed it had generated Pounds
120m for Touche, much of which was not shown as insolvency income but spread
across its accounting and consulting divisions.
Of course, what the fee income figures leave unanswered is the underlying
profitability of the firms. At a dinner for finance directors hosted by
Arthur Andersen last month, one guest got short shrift when he suggested
that as a purchaser interested in the health of his suppliers, he should be
able to examine the firm's accounts.
The response from the Andersen partner - echoed by all his counterparts at
the other firms - was that accountancy practices are partnerships, and are
therefore not bound by the legal requirements of companies to make this
information public.
So while Touche Ross may seem to have suffered on its top line, the bottom
line may well remain healthy. Certainly the firm has cut overheads
substantially, and its revenues per partner place it second in the league
after Andersen at Pounds 973,000. 'Profits are consistent,' is all Mr
Westropp will say.
However, in a profession dominated by firms with their origins in the UK,
Andersen has achieved a remarkable feat. It was a usurper, founded in 1913
in Chicago by a former Price Waterhouse trainee. It began from scratch in
the UK only in 1956.
Much of its more recent growth has been on the back of Andersen Consulting,
the firm's computer services and facilities management arm. That has led to
sniping from some rival firms, which claim Andersen is in a different
market, invalidating comparisons of the figures.
'Methinks they protest too much,' says Mr Keith Burgess, head of Andersen's
consulting arm. 'We are in the business of providing professional services
to our clients. Anybody who believes that what firms delivered 50 years ago
is still right today may help explain one of the reasons for UK's economic
decline.'
One thing seems certain: Andersen's UK ambitious are not yet complete. The
firm is currently in negotiations with most of the regional partnerships
within BDO Binder Hamlyn, the eighth largest firm, for a merger to be
ratified in July. Adding in that income, Andersen is likely to become number
two next year.

FT  09 JUN 94 / LIG to raise Pounds 115m with rescue issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London International Group yesterday revealed the terms of a Pounds 115.2m
rescue rights issue intended to restore the group's balance sheet and enable
it to concentrate on its core condom and surgical gloves activities.
LIG also reported a net loss of Pounds 173.7m for the year to March 31,
including a Pounds 91.4m loss on the sale of LIG's ColourCare International
photo-processing division to management for a nominal sum.
Mr Nick Hodges, chief executive, said: 'There is no doubt in my mind that if
we had not disposed of this business it would have disposed of LIG.'
The rights, a one-for-one issue, was needed to reduce debt of Pounds 168.3m
at the year end, and to plug the Pounds 10.7m net asset deficit caused by
the loss. The shares fell 8 1/2 p to 90 1/2 p on the news, which compares
with the issue price of 70p.
Mr Hodges said the group's aim was to rebuild shareholder value and 'show
that the company is different'. There was a new management team in place;
factory closures had been implemented, more were planned and production
would shift to lower-cost, more highly automated plants in the Far East; and
new marketing ideas were being pursued such as the use of the Durex brand
throughout the world.
Mr James Tyrrell, finance director, said the group aimed to increase
operating margins on its remaining health and personal products activities
to 15 per cent, although this might take until 1997 to achieve. Other
targets included gearing falling to 50-70 per cent and dividend cover of 2-2
1/2 times, although LIG is currently precluded from paying dividends.
It is due to go to the High Court this month for approval of a
reorganisation of its reserves so that it can pay dividends again, although
Mr Hodges could not say when they might resume.
Mr Tyrrell said gearing would still be high, at an indicated 78.6 per cent,
after the rights issue. Last month the group announced the sale of its UK
cough mixture brands for Pounds 11m and its plans further disposals of
non-core health and beauty brands.
As well as the rights, the group has arranged a new Pounds 114.5m loan
facility with five banks, conditional on the rights issue and the sale of
ColourCare. Other lenders would be repaid from the rights proceeds, Mr
Tyrrell said.
The issue was underwritten by SG Warburg, and some shareholders have already
promised to take up 19.46 per cent of the rights.

FT  09 JUN 94 / Euro Disney rights priced at top of forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Euro Disney, the leisure group, has secured shareholders' agreement for a
FFr13bn (Pounds 1.5bn) emergency financial restructuring package and
announced details of FFr6bn rights issue offering seven new shares at FFr10
each for every two existing shares.
The company's share price fell FFr3.50 to FFr33 immediately after the
announcement, which was accompanied by news of a decline in attendance and
expenditure at the EuroDisneyland theme park in the first half of this year.
The shares recovered to close 90 centimes down at FFr35.60.
The rights issue, which marked the final stage of Euro Disney's intricate
rescue negotiations, was priced at the upper end of expectations. Observers
had anticipated a price of between FFr5 and FFr10 until last week's deal
when Prince al-Waleed bin Talal, the Saudi investor, offered to
sub-underwrite the issue.
'Prince al-Waleed's arrival on the scene must have made Euro Disney more
confident in its pricing,' said Ms Rebecca Winnington-Ingram, analyst at
Morgan Stanley.
The size of the prince's eventual stake will be determined by investors'
response to the rights issue. He has offered to buy any surplus shares left
after the issue and is entitled to acquire up to 13 per cent from Walt
Disney, the US group which owns 49 per cent of Euro Disney. However his
eventual stake must be under 24.5 per cent.
Euro Disney, which last month reported a reduced net loss of FFr1.06bn for
the six months to March 31, from FFr4.34bn, yesterday cautioned that trading
conditions had been difficult so far this year.
Mr Philippe Bourguignon, chairman, said the group anticipate a reduced loss
for the second half. However last year's FFr5.3bn net loss was inflated by
restructuring costs. Attendance at EuroDisneyland fell 6 per cent to 3.13m
in the first half of this financial year and expenditure per guest was 7 per
cent lower at FFr229.
The declines reflected the pressures of the European recession and the
French franc's strength against the pound, lire and peseta. These problems
have persisted into the second half.
Euro Disney does not expect to move back into profit at least until 1995/96.
This prompted the Commission des Operations de Bourse, the French stock
market watchdog, to include a routine warning in the rights issue
prospectus.

FT  09 JUN 94 / Brussels seeks to phase out state aid for ailing national
airlines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
State aid to national airlines in financial difficulties would be virtually
phased out in the European Union in the next three years under guidelines
which Brussels is circulating among member states.
The European Commission draft plan could determine how Brussels will conduct
its two week-old investigation into the French government's request for a
further increase of FFr20bn (Pounds 2.33bn) in capital for Air France, its
lossmaking flag carrier.
The guidelines will come into effect as soon as the Commission finishes
consultations within its own departments and with the 12 EU member states.
In the more competitive environment created by the EU's 'open skies'
legislation, the draft document says: 'State aids are of substantially
increased strategic importance since they might severely distort
competition.'
But although the draft calls for a level playing field, it allows for final
cash injections to turn around airlines 'suffering from the burdens of the
past', and for short-term 'rescue aid' to carriers attempting to
restructure.
However, a 'fresh start' for troubled airlines involving government aid must
be based on commercial principles and include:
A 'comprehensive restructuring programme' including capacity reduction
No further state aid thereafter
No government interference in management
No use of the aid by the airline for acquiring stakes in other EU carriers
No attempt to strengthen market position in contravention of EU law opening
up European routes to greater competition.
The Commission's transport directorate wants to end state aid to airlines by
April 1 1997. 'After that date the Commission will very stringently assess
the effects of the aid on competition, and, if at all, accept such aid
programmes in very exceptional cases only, and only if it includes severe
cutbacks in capacity,' the draft guidelines say.
The guidelines are broadly in line with the recommendations of the
'Committee of Wise Men' which the Commission asked to report on the airline
industry earlier this year. But the aviation 'liberals' among the 12 -
principally the UK, Germany, Denmark, the Netherlands and Ireland - could
push for tighter screening and a more rapid aid phase-out.
The new Air France request is particularly controversial because in 1991 and
1992 the Commission approved a capital top-up for the troubled French
carrier worth FFr5.8bn in three tranches.
Further aid, critics like British Airways say, conflicts with the Brussels
doctrine of 'last chance' restructuring aid.
In addition, they say, only under duress has Air France started to abide by
its EU obligations to open up routes to competition.

FT  09 JUN 94 / Tories claim late surge of support ahead of Euro poll: Lib
Dem by-election candidate's defection boosts Labour hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Conservatives last night claimed a strong late surge in support as Mr
John Major prepared for the most daunting test of his government's authority
since the 1992 general election.
But a spectacular defection by a Liberal Democrat by-election candidate
boosted Labour's confidence that the European elections will provide its
strongest performance in a nationwide poll since 1966.
Optimism among ministers that Tory losses could be limited to perhaps a
dozen of their 32 seats was dented by a new opinion poll suggesting it will
win a smaller share of the vote than in any other postwar election.
The government has already discounted a crushing defeat at the hand of the
Liberal Democrats in the once safe Tory seat of Eastleigh in today's clutch
of five by-elections.
Mr Major used the final day of campaigning to emphasise the Conservatives'
claim to be the only party willing to stand up for Britain's interests in
Europe.
Seizing on the latest indicators as evidence that the pace of economic
recovery was accelerating, the prime minister said the campaign had provided
a powerful endorsement of its call for a flexible rather than centralised
European Union. Britain was leading Europe out of recession.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, ended an intensive nationwide tour
with a similarly confident assertion that the government had recaptured core
Conservative supporters.
The Liberal Democrats were stunned by the public announcement from Mr Alec
Kellaway, the party's candidate in the Newham North East by-election, that
he intends to join the Labour party.
With Mr Tony Blair widely expected to win the leadership election which will
follow immediately today's poll, it was being cited by Labour as evidence
that Labour is poised to regain its lost following in southern England.
The two opposition parties wound up their campaigns by insisting the outcome
would represent voters' judgment on Mr Major's 'failed' government.
Labour officials were predicting privately that the party is assured of
around 55 of the 84 seats being contested in Britain. The Liberal Democrats,
currently unrepresented in the Strasbourg assembly, are confident of
securing at least three and hopeful of winning up to 10.
A Mori opinion poll in today's Times, based on an unusually large sample,
supported opposition hopes that the electorate is ready to punish the
government for its domestic record.
The poll gave Labour a 28 point lead, with 51 per cent of the projected
vote, against the Conservatives' 23 per cent and the Liberal Democrats' 20
per cent. Mori calculated that on the basis of those figures the number of
Conservative seats in Strasbourg could fall to between four and 15.

FT  09 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Lloyds/C&amp;G
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's High Court judgment puts a formidable obstacle in the way of
Lloyds Bank's bid for Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester. Though ordinary depositors
can receive bonus payments regardless of their length of membership, share
account holders of less than two years' standing cannot. Without their vote
the requisite majority would almost certainly be unattainable. Since the two
parties remain confident of their legal ground, the obvious route is to
appeal. It is difficult to conceive of alternative inducements, especially
since the judgment made no distinction between cash and paper.
The new uncertainty threatens the 5 per cent out-performance of Lloyds'
shares against the sector since the deal was announced. After its abortive
bid for Midland, Lloyds cannot let C&amp;G slip through its fingers without
being thrown right back into a strategic impasse. The tragedy for the bank
is that the judgment appears to rest on a quirk in the wording of the law.
More generally it is a forceful reminder that the playing field is uneven.
These problems do not arise in cases where building societies are
transforming themselves into banks. Yet that creates just as much risk of
deposits switching from society to society in search of inducements. There
is ever more urgent need for full public debate before the law is redrafted.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Nick Hodges of London International is almost certainly right to claim
that the group had to dispose of its photo-processing business if it was not
to end up disposing of itself. But the restructuring announced yesterday is
not necessarily the end of the story. Even after the rights issue, gearing
will be nearly 80 per cent and LIG has little chance of trading its way out
of debt. It will have to sell some more peripheral businesses, but to avoid
earnings dilution it will have to find buyers willing to pay reasonably full
prices.
LIG's other task is to raise the return on its condom business which had a
disappointing year thanks to a catalogue of difficulties such as destocking
by Italian pharmacies. It is unlikely to meet its target of a 15 per cent
margin for a year or two, but there is a chance its new polyurethane condom
could unlock both higher margins and increasing market share. In that case
LIG should easily manage earnings of around 8p by 1996-97 and its shares
look good value at yesterday's closing ex-rights price of 80p.
Equally, if the current management falls short of its margin target, the
strength of LIG's Durex brand and its surgical gloves business may tempt
someone else to have a go. The photo-processing business was a trap for any
unwary predator. Now it is gone, LIG is more vulnerable. Based on the
current market valuation and including debt, LIG would still be worth only
around 1.2 times sales after the restructuring. That looks affordable even
to a predator willing to pay a substantial premium for control.

FT  09 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Northern Foods
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In the long run the migration of shoppers to large supermarkets should work
in Northern Foods' favour. Its position as a supplier of own-label foods to
the likes of Marks and Spencer and Sainsbury is a strength. Yet problems
arise when this migration becomes a stampede. Last year's price war among
supermarket giants drew customers away from local stores in droves. Doorstep
milk deliveries fell by 12 per cent. Since these outlets account for a large
slice of Northern's business, profits across the group barely grew.
For all its efforts to rationalise distribution to smaller stores and
franchise milk rounds, this year will be equally tough if food prices
continue to fall. In addition to declining volumes on the non-supermarket
side, Northern will have to fight its corner on margins with the
supermarkets themselves. Grabbing a decent share of the wholesale milk
market once it is open to competition would help cement Northern's position
in this area. But the immediate impact on profits is unlikely to be great.
While the earnings outlook is dull, Northern continues to generate cash.
Financing modest acquisitions would present no problem even though capital
spending is running well ahead of depreciation. Yet for the moment the
equity market is more interested in recovery stories than other virtues. The
shares stand at little more than half 1991's rights price. If the equity
market is not prepared to value fully a cash-generative and strategically
well-positioned company, others in the food industry may be tempted to step
in.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The flaws in Enterprise's industrial case for acquiring Lasmo have not been
removed by its latest document. The weakest argument is that there would be
savings from joint use of infrastructure. Enterprise argues that the
profitability of future developments would be enhanced by cheap access to
Lasmo's pipelines in Liverpool Bay and elsewhere. The snag is not simply
that access on non-commercial terms would be impossible given that other
companies also own stakes in the infrastructure. Even if it were possible,
enhanced profitability of Enterprise's developments would merely be matched
by reduced profitability of Lasmo's infrastructure.
Another Enterprise argument - that its expertise in three-dimensional
surveys could be applied to Lasmo - is hardly better. Lasmo has been using
3-D technology for over a decade. That leaves Enterprise's criticism of
Lasmo's slow development of its Indonesian interests as the company's most
persuasive argument. But even here, the case is not clear-cut. Lasmo's Sanga
Sanga concession is fairly mature and so unlikely to yield vast new
treasures.
Enterprise should reconsider its strategy of trying to join the big boys'
game. An alternative would be to return to its roots as an exploration
company by splitting itself into two. One half could contain most of its
current production assets as well as group debt. This company would pay
investors handsome dividends and gradually liquidate itself. The other half
would focus on exploration and would offer investors the hope of capital
gains. Enterprise once toyed with this idea. When reminded of it today, the
company said it was only joking.

FT  09 JUN 94 / Leading Article: A distant parliament
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In theory the elections to the European parliament today and on Sunday
should be taken more seriously than previous such ballots. The assembly at
Strasbourg is not an impotent talking-shop. It has the power to amend
European Union legislation.
The Maastricht treaty enables it to veto some proposals, accept or reject
the nominations for the new European Commission due to take office in 1995,
and check the union's budget. It should be able to influence a broad range
of EU policies, including foreign relations. Some of its elected members may
become rapporteurs on important Union directives. As such, they arguably
have more power than most backbenchers in national parliaments. Lobbyists
and pressure groups have discovered this. Consequently, they devote
increasing attention and expenditure to influencing MEPs.
The public, perhaps influenced by the media, remains largely unmoved. Voter
participation this weekend is expected to be low, on average below 50 per
cent in countries where voting is not obligatory. The turnout in Britain in
1989 was only 36 per cent. It would not be surprising if the figure this
time is even lower. Few of those who vote will do so primarily for the
ostensible purpose of this weekend's election, namely to choose a
representative to send to the European Parliament. Most are likely to use
the opportunity to express dissatisfaction with their national governments.
Opportunity
In Britain, the Conservative party's nationalistic rhetoric may be in tune
with the sentiments of many of its traditional supporters, but the
expectation is that large numbers of them will stay at home anyway. Everyone
can see how divided the government is in its approach to the EU. Besides,
the opportunity to deliver a protest to an administration that polling
suggests is more unpopular than any in post-1945 history seems too tempting
to miss. This is why Labour has campaigned on domestic, not EU, issues and
the Liberal Democrats have not flaunted their Europeanism.
Britain has stuck to first-past-the-post rather than a proportional voting
system. In consequence, the left bloc in the European parliament is likely
to be disproportionately well represented. It is not clear that this will
mean much to the European electorate. In Germany, where the turnout was 62.4
per cent in 1989, both the Christian Democrats and the opposition Social
Democrats have campaigned on national issues such as unemployment and crime,
although these have been given a European flavour. In France (1989 turnout
48.7 per cent) participation is also expected to be lower this year. A
lacklustre campaign is primarily interesting as a guide to the likely
outcome of next year's presidential election. Anti-Maastricht parties may,
however, do relatively well in both countries. A small but disturbing
minority may support parties of the far right, notably in France, Germany
and Italy.
Accountability
This anticipated lack of fervour for the European parliament may disappoint
its members, but the voters know what they are doing. The Strasbourg
assembly does not have the full power to grant or withhold taxation, or pass
legislation. Such prerogatives are still held by the national states. The
European Commission is an executive of sorts, but it is not democratically
accountable. It is not dependent on a majority in the parliament for
day-to-day decision-making, as are the cabinets of the 12 member
governments. Its powers, while not negligible, do not seem to the electors
to relate to their bread-and-butter concerns.
Since the fall of communism in 1989 Europe has entered a period of
uncertainty. The evolution implicit in the Maastricht treaty is no longer
regarded as desirable by all member states. Putative new members of the
Union are understandably hesitant, as the Austrians may show in their
referendum on Sunday. The further evolution of the EU will be pursued, if at
all, at variable speeds according to national circumstance. The shape of
that evolution is no longer predictable. Many citizens of the EU understand
this. Their response is naturally to focus on their national interests.
Voting for a distant and incomprehensible parliament towards the end of a
deeply-felt recession is therefore bound to be patchy.

FT  09 JUN 94 / Old enemies make tricky friends: Nato's relationship with
Russia is proving unexpectedly difficult for the west to define
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A senior aide to Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, former president of the Soviet Union,
once made a prophetic warning to the west: 'We will do something terrible to
you. We will take away your enemy.'
Those words will haunt the foreign ministers of Nato's 16 members as they
convene today in Istanbul, to be joined tomorrow by their counterparts from
the former Warsaw Pact. The stakes are high. If Nato and Russia can bridge
their substantial differences over new security arrangements in Europe and
beyond, this could pave the way for a breakthrough in the broader
relationship between Russia and the west. It could be sealed perhaps with a
triumphant appearance for Russia's President Boris Yeltsin at the Group of
Seven summit in Naples next month. Ideally, Russia would like the group to
be rechristened the Group of Eight, but the best it can hope for is
participation in the group's political - not economic - discussions.
In the face of Russia's aspirations, alliance members will be trying to
balance their attempts at accommodating Mr Yeltsin with the need to reassure
Moscow's former 'satellites', the Poles, Czechs and Hungarians, that Russia
would not have a veto over policy.
These would be hard tasks for the alliance even if members were clear about
their common purpose. But as the Russians are keenly aware, Nato now lacks
the consolidating influence of a good, old-fashioned enemy. Bereft of a
communist foe, the alliance has been grooming itself to act as an
all-purpose multinational taskforce, ready to move on the instructions of
other international bodies, such as the United Nations or the 53-nation
Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. Yet the experience of
Bosnia - where Nato polices the sea and air, while the UN operates on the
ground - has shown how acutely uncomfortable the alliance feels about acting
as servant rather than master.
Such uncertainty is haunting Nato at a time when Russia's leadership has
presented it with a foreign policy stance both ambitious and shrewdly
judged. While some of Russia's ideas sound far-fetched to western ears, Nato
defence ministers were nevertheless dazed by the skill of the diplomatic
assault mounted in Brussels two weeks ago by General Pavel Grachev.
They had a rough idea of what he was going to say. First, he would signal
adherence to the Partnership for Peace, a military co-operation programme
designed by Nato that involves joint exercises and the possibility (for some
countries, at least) of eventual full membership. He would also demand a
special relationship between Nato and Russia.
The ministers had their answer ready: no to a formal treaty separate from
PFP; yes to a political statement that would stroke the Muscovite ego by
acknowledging Russia's importance, and yes to a dialogue at Nato's
discretion.
Gen Grachev lightened a tense atmosphere by telling the waiting ministers
that, of course, Russia would join PFP. But the next day, he put forward a
list of proposals so tough and far-reaching that few listeners immediately
understood them. These included:
the creation of a Eurasian security order whose apex would be formed not by
Nato, but by the CSCE;
the subordination to the CSCE of all other security organisations: Nato, the
Western European Union and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS),
which comprises 12 ex-Soviet republics; if the CSCE provided political and
diplomatic leadership, then its 'military arm' might be provided by the
North Atlantic Co-operation Council, which consists of Nato, the former
Warsaw Pact and the former Soviet republics;
an 'effective mechanism of consultation' between Russia and Nato 'on the
whole range of European and world security issues, which could function both
in emergencies and on a regular basis' - in other words, whenever Russia
wanted.
To cap it all, Gen Grachev produced eight pages of 'parameters' which would
govern Russia's participation in PFP and which, on inspection, look like the
preconditions which Nato had vowed never to consider.
While consideration of Russia's parameters can itself be viewed as a
concession by Nato, the alliance does not have the slightest intention of
submitting itself to the CSCE or to an effective Russian veto over its
actions. In any case, the CSCE has neither the financial nor the
administrative resources to become the policeman of Eurasia.
When the Russians arrive tomorrow, however, it should become clearer to what
extent compromise hinges on the unrealistic institutional changes outlined
by Gen Grachev. Like the general's verbal pronouncements, the points are an
artful 'mixture of the constructive, the negotiable and the outrageous',
according to a Nato official. There are imaginative ideas about military
co-operation; requests for a dialogue on nuclear safety and
non-proliferation; and fresh demands for Nato to become the junior branch of
the CSCE.
But discernible through the high-flown Russian rhetoric is a more realistic
agenda, reflecting the 'bottom-line' aspirations of both sides. Moscow wants
freedom of action in the steadily reintegrating CIS; Nato wants the same
freedom plus legal and diplomatic imprimatur in as wide an area as possible.
Neither side is happy to give the other carte blanche, and each would
ideally like to retain some say over the behaviour of the other. But the two
sides' aspirations are not so contradictory as to rule out the possibility
of compromise; and if such a compromise on freedom of action is to be
struck, then some body with roughly the same membership as the CSCE would be
needed to regulate it.
The initial Nato reaction to Russian proposals for a triad based on the CSCE
(or something like it), Nato and the CIS will almost certainly be a chorus
of denunciation. But as Russian strategists are aware, each member of the
chorus will be singing a somewhat different tune.
Some of the strongest opposition to any real upgrading of the CSCE will come
from the US, which is already unhappy about the loss of sovereignty it
suffers when working through the United Nations and has no stomach for
involvement with another unwieldy institution.
But Germany has shown greater sympathy for a limited increase in the CSCE's
remit. Days before Gen Grachev arrived in Brussels, the German government
floated proposals - designed in part to satisfy Russian concerns - that
would increase the CSCE's authority to intervene in conflicts, if necessary
without the consent of the warring parties.
By putting forward the CIS as one of the pillars of a new security
arrangement, Moscow is effectively asking for western recognition of its
influence in the three republics of trans-Caucasia and the five of Central
Asia. If, in return for such acknowledgement, Russia is prepared to
guarantee restraint in its behaviour on its western borders, it would be a
tempting deal for Germany, which is acutely worried about the security of
its central European neighbours.
For most other Nato countries, hesitation over endorsing Russian tactics in
the CIS - which have included intervention in the supposedly 'internal'
conflicts of its neighbours - is tempered by the thought that almost
anything is preferable to chaos.
However, one alliance member is definitely not prepared to cede all
influence over the southern republics of the CIS to Russia - and that is
Turkey. There is undisguised dismay among the hosts today at the prospect of
tolerating Russian hegemony over parts of the world which until recently
were viewed as ripe for incorporation into the cultural and economic orbit
of Turkey.
Russian tactics in the republics to its south have included frequent
recourse to the imperialist principle of divide-and-rule - supporting one
side and then the other, and occasionally both simultaneously - in the
internecine conflicts of places like Georgia and Tajikistan. Unless the Nato
ministers are careful, they could find the 'divide-and-rule' principle being
turned on them.

A chance to win a methuselah of Veuve Clicquot. Contestants must predict the
difference between the number of first-class runs scored by Warwickshire
batsman Brian Lara this summer and the Footsie close on Monday, September 19
 -the final day of the English cricket season. Lara's aggregate currently
stands at 1,176, with the FTSE 100 Index hovering around 3,000.
To assist those not in possession of a recent Wisden, Denis Compton holds
the record of 3,816 runs scored in 1947, while Jimmy Cook's 1991 tally of
2,755 is the highest since the number of championship games was reduced in
1969. The Footsie's record close was set this year at 3,520.3. Answer by
mail or fax to 071 873 3926 - not telephone please - by Friday June 17. In
the case of a tie the winner will be picked by Simon Rostron, the City PR
man who is putting up the prize.

Best quote of a less-than-inspirational European election campaign in the UK

comment that in politics it is much easier to tell the truth - that way you
don't have nearly as much to remember. Why didn't Kennedy think of that on
the first day of the campaign?

To mark today's Bank of England central banking symposium, Observer offers
10 things you always wanted to know about one of the world's most secretive
clubs.
There are 170 members of the species; Sweden's Riksbank is the oldest; there
are over half a million central bankers of whom 100,000 work for the
People's Bank of China; the Solomon Islands has the smallest central bank;
over half of all central banks are under 40 years old; Britain is the only
country where the governor traditionally gets a life peerage; state-owned
central banks perform less well than those partly owned by the private
sector; the Bundesbank, Bank of France and Bank of Italy each cost almost as
much to run as the US Federal Reserve System; the Bank of England is much
cheaper to run and increased its pre-tax profits to Pounds 120m last year;
but its record of keeping a check on inflation is less impressive. Central
Banking magazine, source of most of the above stats, calculates that Britain
comes 55th out of 110 countries surveyed and is wedged between Barbados and
the Central African Republic. No surprise which is number one - the
Bundesbank.

How nice to see market forces finally at work in that previously tightly
state-controlled sector, the former Soviet space industry.
Colonel Talgat Musabayev, a would-be cosmonaut, is being squabbled over by
Russia and Kazakhstan; both want him as their interplanetary representative.
Russia says he either flies for Russia or Kazakhstan will be charged Dollars
10m a week while he is in space, the going rate for 'foreigners' aboard
Russian spacecraft.
Musabayev was a Soviet citizen until 1991. And although an ethnic Kazakh, he
remained in Russia as an officer with the Russian air force; he holds a
Russian residency permit; and works at the Russian cosmonaut training
centre.
Due to blast off in early July, in theory he should stay in orbit for four
months - meaning his flight would cost more than Kazakhstan's entire space
budget.

FT  09 JUN 94 / Observer: Citizen Spiers joins up
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
At last the UK Citizen's Charter panel recruits someone with experience at
the sharp end. John Spiers has joined in order to focus the panel's mind on
standards in the National Health Service.
Spiers also happens to be chairman of the Brighton Health Care Trust, which
achieved notoriety in April for its novel approach to reducing hospital
waiting lists - refusing physiotherapy to chronically sick patients aged
over 65. A copy of a letter outlining the policy found its way into the
hands of the BBC.
Quick as a flash, Spiers denied that the policy involved 'discrimination'
but was simply 'targeting' resources, thus demonstrating the sort of PR
skills now required of the new breed of NHS managers. Targeting is no doubt
a firm fixture in the NHS lexicon of useful jargon.
Still, Spiers did partially redeem himself, by exposing the rotten
conditions in his trust's hospitals. Arriving in a wheelchair at the Royal
Sussex County hospital in Brighton, Spiers posed as a patient needing
assistance.
A series of inexcusable mishaps culminated in an exchange with a surly
porter who was not wearing a name badge.
When Spiers pointed out that name badges were obligatory under the Patient's
Charter, the porter told him to 'f*** off'. Which apparently is not in the
said lexicon.

FT  09 JUN 94 / Leading Article: Questions for the bankers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The collection of central bankers present in London to celebrate the
tercentenary of the Bank of England have never enjoyed greater independent
authority over monetary policy. But power brings vexatious responsibility
and important questions remain to be solved.
Abandonment of the gold standard was largely explained by a belief that
monetary policy should help secure full employment. Unfortunately, the
Bretton Woods monetary system proved inadequate to curb the consequent
impulse towards over-expansionary monetary policy. Where the system failed,
experience succeeded. Events in the 1970s justified the fundamental notion
of the monetarist counter-revolution, which was that a monetary expansion
would, in the long run, lead only to higher inflation.
Enter, then, the modern independent central bank, with its clear mandate to
secure price stability. That had been the mission of the Bundesbank, whose
establishment reflected both the anti-Keynesian views of German policymakers
and the country's catastrophic monetary experience. Its example has been
increasingly imitated throughout the world. With the UK government's
explicit inflation target, the inflation report, the publication of minutes
of the meetings between the chancellor of the exchequer and the governor of
the Bank of England and the latter's increasingly outspoken comments, even
the Old Lady is on a looser chain.
Extraordinary freedom
In the absence of exchange rate or monetary targets, central banks have
extraordinary freedom in deciding how to achieve their objectives and even
to define the precise criteria by which they are to be judged. Even where
banks are not formally independent, as in the UK, the disappearance of
exchange controls gives them great leverage over government. Their power to
publish is also power to destroy government credibility.
The case for such enhanced central bank autonomy is overwhelming. People
make financial decisions that are much longer term than is any parliament.
To do so safely and efficiently, they must have confidence in the monetary
framework. Even though this case for independence is widely conceded, the
debate over central banking is far from over. At least four big questions
remain.
The first is how best to combine independence with accountability. The New
Zealand example, with its precise 0-2 per cent target for inflation, looks
attractive. It forces the central bank to be more explicit about its views,
thereby increasing confidence in markets.
Target zones
The second is how to link currencies. At present, major currencies are in a
lightly managed float against one another. It is easy to accept that it
might be better in an ideal world for there to be a world currency, as under
the gold standard. That is politically infeasible. Yet it is uncertain
whether a more managed float, such as one involving 'target zones', would be
an improvement.
The third is how to manage increasingly complex and interlinked global
financial markets. The problem of derivatives is on everyone's lips. There
is also growing concern at the persistent tendency of the markets to bubble
and collapse, transmitting the ill-effects worldwide.
Finally, there is the issue of banking supervision. Again the innovator, the
Reserve Bank of New Zealand, has decided to hand this job over to the
markets, by insisting that all information be made public. The advantages of
such a shift or, alternatively, of separating central banking from
supervision seem evident. Only thus would it be difficult for depositors,
seeking compensation, to argue that central bankers are to blame for bank
failures.
Answering these questions will not be easy. Internationally, central bankers
will have to manage an ever higher degree of co-operation, given the
increasing integration of financial markets. Domestically, they will be
blamed when things go wrong and will be tempted to hide themselves behind a
veil of secrecy. But they can achieve what they want only if they say what
they are doing and why. Theirs is a game of credibility and confidence. It
must, correspondingly, be played with consistency and clarity.

FT  09 JUN 94 / Personal View: Channel shoppers' storm in pint pot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN PRESSNELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK brewers are at odds with the government. The issue is the difference
between UK and French excise levels - and the brewers are crying 'foul'.
They complain that the disparity between the two countries' duty levels is
leading to a flood of beer imports from France into the UK which is damaging
the brewing industry. They want to see UK duty halved. But have they and the
Brewers and Licensed Retailers' Association got it right?
New evidence continues to emerge to cast doubt on the extent of their
claims. While UK consumers are clearly exploiting lower French beer prices,
lack of official data has created controversy about the impact of the single
market.
No-one disputes that duty on beer in the UK is among the highest in Europe -
nearly 30p a pint, compared with 4p in France, while the recommended EU
level is 8p. In 1992, the UK industry and the Brewers' Society (now the
BLRA), predicted that the new 'personal import allowance' of 110 litres of
beer - introduced in January 1993 to comply with EU requirements - would
encourage cross-Channel shoppers to enjoy the lower beer prices on the
Continent.
The BLRA carried out its own survey during 1993 and in its findings,
published in February, claimed that personal imports in 1993 were around
1.9m hectolitres of beer, or 330m pints. This would equal around 15 per cent
of the UK take-home trade.
The survey was swiftly endorsed by leading brewers. Although undoubtedly
extensive and based on observation at ports as well as consumer research,
important primary evidence suggests personal imports were probably no more
than half this level. The difference matters, because if the industry is to
convince government it must approach the problem with defensible data.
The UK government has produced figures for receipts from beer duty in 1993
showing there was actually an increase, from Pounds 2.39bn in 1992 to Pounds
2.41bn. UK consumption of beer per head is 100 litres a year, well above the
EU average of 82 litres but below the most recent 'high' of 120 litres. And
the underlying trend is long-term decline, due to factors such as the growth
of alternative drinks and demographic shifts. The view that an increase in
consumption would compensate for a duty reduction is unrealistic. Denmark
reduced beer duty by more than 30 per cent from 1991-1993, yet the market
has remained flat.
According to Stats MR, a retail audit company, UK take-home beer market
volumes grew by about 2 per cent in 1993. Yet, according to the BLRA survey,
this sector ought to have declined, perhaps by at least 5 per cent. Nor is
there evidence that on-premises beer sales fell by more than 4 per cent.
In France, a sharp rise in sales, to reflect a supposedly dramatic increase
in personal imports to the UK, would have been expected. Yet, according to
data from the Association des Brasseurs de France (the French equivalent of
the BLRA), beer consumption actually fell from 23m hectolitres to 22.6m in
1993. These figures include all beer sold in France and therefore cover beer
purchased in the Calais hypermarkets by cross-Channel shoppers.
The decline of the French market in 1993 clearly does not credibly
accommodate the 1.9m hectolitres of UK personal imports. Total beer sales in
1993 in continental EU and Efta countries were down around 3 per cent. It is
unlikely that domestic demand in France was down by more than 5 per cent.
This suggests personal imports from France into the UK in 1993 were actually
around 800,000 hectolitres, perhaps 1m at most, depending on the 1992 level.
Senior sources within the French brewing industry endorse both this view of
their domestic market development in 1993 and the level of cross-channel
shopping.
Cross-channel passenger loadings lend further circumstantial evidence.
According to the ferry operators, there were 3m vehicle journeys in 1993, or
1.5m return trips. Even the lower estimate for personal imports still equals
around 60 litres per return trip, while the BLRA survey would imply that
every vehicle took a full allowance. Total passenger journeys were much
higher, at 8.5m return trips, but this would include coach loads of school
children, and foot passengers unable to transport more than a fraction of
their allowance - 110 litres is, after all, a lot of beer.
The current situation is, of course, a damaging short-term problem. The new
allowances are open to abuse, but Customs and Excise are alert to the
problem. If the UK brewing industry, supported by defensible data, were to
call for a more measured approach to reducing duty to recommended EU levels,
it is more likely to be heeded.

FT  09 JUN 94 / Book Review: In the long run, Keynes is still dead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE

<TEXT>
PEDDLING PROSPERITY By Paul Krugman W W Norton, Dollars 22, 303 pages
Unlike a starry-eyed reviewer for The Economist. I feel no urge to nominate
Paul Krugman for a Nobel prize. Krugman has a rare gift for conveying
complex ideas in simple, entertaining prose. But his central argument - that
a revived version of Keynesian theory has superseded conservative economics
 -is too wrongheaded to deserve support.
The best parts of the book deal with new theories. The chapter on 'QWERTY'
economics is vintage Krugman. The top line of keys on a typewriter, he
notes, reads QWERTYUIOP. This choice is not particularly easy on the
fingers. It just happened to be chosen by the first makers of typewriters.
But since typists learned their trade on QWERTY machines, future
manufacturers had to cater to their needs. As a result an inefficient
keyboard design quickly became 'locked in'.
Krugman believes the structure of modern economies is heavily influenced by
such accidents of history; just as a wise bureaucrat could, in principle,
have stipulated a more efficient keyboard so, today, judicious industrial
intervention could improve on unfettered market outcomes.
He also recounts the supposed death blow to conservative macroeconomics
dealt by George Akerlof, a Berkeley economist. Akerlof pointed out that most
economists assume people are totally rational. But in the real world it is
irrational to be perfectly rational because you would spend forever
collecting the information needed for an efficient decision. Most people are
thus slightly irrational. But the collective results of slight irrationality
can be devastating. For example slight deviations from rationality might
lead workers to refuse even small wage cuts. But if everybody refuses to
adjust, the result is high unemployment and widespread economic dislocation
 -something nobody wanted.
The root argument here is that the cumulative result of individually
sensible decisions can be serious inefficiencies and, occasionally,
disasters such as the Great Depression. To Krugman and friends, such
reasoning provides a powerful theoretical justification for government
intervention - both to prevent or ameliorate recessions and to improve
industrial structure.
While admiring Krugman's style of argument, I find the book neither
consistent nor, ultimately, convincing. Just consider the plot. Krugman
spends the best part of a decade poking holes in the classical theory of
free trade, gaining in the process a reputation as one of leading 'new
Keynesians'. The general tenor of his work inspires future policy makers
such as Laura D'Andrea Tyson, the White House chief economist, and Robert
Reich, the labor secretary. Once in power they try to implement more
interventionist policies. Now Krugman pulls away the rug, declaring that he
always believed that free trade, in practice, was the right approach:
Clinton officials have just failed to grasp the subtleties of his argument.
Isn't this a bit rich?
There is an ugly twist to the story. Krugman is not content to attack the
arguments of 'policy entrepreneurs' - his pejorative term for Reich and
other supposedly shallow thinkers. He is an unabashed 'credentialist' - a
snooty professor who believes that only people with the right paper
qualifications deserve to be taken seriously. He pulls academic rank on
Reich, telling readers that he has no formal training in economics and was
only a lecturer at Harvard. Krugman, of course, is a full professor at MIT.
In a similar vein, he attacks Robert Bartley, editor of the Wall Street
Journal, and a peddler of a different kind of prosperity in the early 1980s.
Instead of confining himself to an economic critique of Bartley's
tax-cutting philosophy, he relates how Bartley 'began work as a reporter at
the age of 22'. How absurd, in other words, to pay him any attention: he
does not even have a graduate degree.
More important, Krugman exaggerates the significance of the revival of
Keynesian theories. We have already seen that he violently opposes any
attempt to draw practical policy conclusions from QWERTY economics - perhaps
because he knows that 'government failure' is usually a more serious problem
than 'market failure'. The only moral he draws from the new Keynesian
macroeconomics of Akerlof and others is that central banks must lower
interest rates during recessions. Big news. Would Alan Greenspan, the
Federal Reserve chairman, and a lifelong conservative, disagree?
I would hate readers to gain the impression that an intellectual revolution
has occurred in which Krugman and friends have vanquished the arguments of
conservatives such as Milton Friedman. It just is not true. Indeed, the
striking thing is how much conservative economics Krugman now accepts.
In 1968 Friedman argued that there was no long-run trade off between
inflation and unemployment. Attempts to maintain unemployment below a
'natural rate' would simply lead to accelerating inflation. The argument was
rejected by most academics, including Krugman's mentors - the leading
Keynesians at Harvard and MIT. The economic misery of the 1970s was largely
caused by policy makers' vain attempts to refute Friedman's logic.
Now Krugman, the new Keynesian, describes Friedman's argument as 'one of the
decisive intellectual achievements of postwar economics'. He also accepts
that inflation is essentially a monetary phenomenon, that fiscal fine-tuning
does not work, that high taxes destroy incentives, that government
regulations undermine business, and that trade should not be managed.
How peculiar then that he should write so contemptuously of the 'moral and
intellectual decline of conservative economics'. If this is decline, perhaps
we should have more of it.

FT  09 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: R&amp;D the victim of high dividend
policies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr J H MULVEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Lord Hanson objects to Treasury financial secretary Stephen Dorrell's
querying City practices, and in particular defends the insistence on
consistently high dividends in bad times as well as good ('Hanson angered by
Dorrell query over 'too high' dividends', June 4/5). But no one who has read
the evidence presented to the House of Commons committee on trade and
industry inquiry into the competitiveness of UK manufacturing industry can
seriously doubt the City's negative influence on the level of industrial
investment in the UK compared to that in our main competitor nations.
The effect on management is either to require internal rates of return two
to three times higher than the nominal interest rate or unrealistically
short pay-back periods, to avoid risking the value of dividends.
The City view that if UK industry is not investing in R&amp;D it must be because
management sees no opportunities must leave research directors gaping, and
our foreign competitors laughing.
A survey by KPMG Peat Marwick of nearly 700 company directors revealed that
the most difficult aspect of performing R&amp;D was finding the money. Managing
directors of companies listed on the Stock Exchange were almost at one (82
per cent) in saying the City does not understand R&amp;D investment
requirements. If nothing worse, there is a manifest breakdown of
comprehension at the critical interface between industry and the financial
sector. Stephen Dorrell should be thanked for bringing these issues into the
open. Here is where the country should be looking to understand the failure
to 'realise the potential' of an outstanding tradition of research in
science and technology.
Yet last year's white paper on science and technology in the cause of
'wealth creation' (which only two out of 14 City analysts interviewed by
KPMG knew about) ignores these problems, while introducing a more dirigiste
approach to management of research that could threaten the vitality and
originality of the science base.

FT  09 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: OECD employment plan called into
question
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DENIS MACSHANE MP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, You report that the OECD has revised its growth forecast for Germany
for 1994 upward from 0.8 per cent to 1.8 per cent ('Retreat by bunds drags
European prices lower', June 8). These figures may appear trifling but they
represent huge sums of money. Instead of adding Dollars 12bn to its gross
domestic product - the OECD's original estimate - the Paris statisticians
now say Dollars 28bn of extra wealth will be created in Germany.
There are three important conclusions that can be drawn from this. First,
what other economic organisation gets its forecast wrong by more than 100
per cent? Second, how is this impressive German growth squared with
complaints that Germany has the highest social costs, highest wages, and
most powerful unions and works councils in the world? Third, should we take
much notice of the OECD plan for employment which is largely based on
theories of deregulation, lower wages and longer work hours which have only
increased poverty and social division when applied in the UK and US in
recent years?

FT  09 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Commission's aim on contracting out
is clarification
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID LEA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In his article, 'Government near victory on contracting-out reform'
(May 31), David Goodhart seems to have swallowed a heavy dose of Department
of Employment propaganda in arguing that the UK government is 'near victory'
in securing the exclusion of contracting out from the EU Acquired Rights
directive (Tupe). Although the government has been lobbying vigorously in
Brussels for an amendment to this effect, the revisions proposed by the
Commission are not geared to any such objective.
Indeed, the Commission's purpose in revising the 1977 directive is not to
reduce the protections that it provides, but to clarify its operation. The
new definition of a transfer set out in Article 1 does not exclude
contracting out. It simply codifies recent decisions of the European Court
of Justice in the leading cases of Sophie Redmond, Spijkers, and Schmidt,
among others. In each of those cases the ECJ explained that the key test of
whether a transfer had taken place was whether an economic entity which had
retained its identity had been transferred. Identical words are to be found
in the new Article 1 of the 1977 directive.
It is also worth noting that both the Trades Union Congress and the
Confederation of British Industry have been consulted on the most recent
proposal from the Commission through their European organisations, the ETUC
and UNICE. We would not have been happy with a text which reduced the
existing protections, and in my view there is nothing in the new Article 1
which will cause difficulties for the trade union movement. The revision
does have several further stages to go through before it is finally adopted,
and it therefore seems premature to suggest that the government is 'near
victory'.
Far from indicating that the EU 'is moving to accommodate the UK's
deregulatory approach' the proposed revision of the directive demonstrates
the Commission's determination to defend high standards of social protection
against sustained ideological assault. Nor is it the case that the amended
directive will assist the government at national level. The controversy
surrounding the application of the directive and Tupe 1981 to compulsory
competitive tendering and market testing looks set to continue. However,
with each new decision of the UK courts and the ECJ it is becoming clearer
that most forms of competition in public services are caught by both Tupe
and the directive.

FT  09 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Statistics tell nothing about
individual poor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PAUL ASHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Following publication of the Institute for Fiscal Studies report on the
distribution of incomes, you comment in your editorial ('More unequal than
others', June 3) that 'the evidence that the poorest in society are not
benefiting from the economic growth enjoyed by the majority is mounting'.
However, what the IFS figures show, very clearly, is just how misleading
some statistics can be.
It needs to be pointed out that the figures tell us nothing about how
individuals fared over any of the time periods studied in the report.
Its data contained no information about how individuals, or households, who
appeared in the 'poor' category in one year progressed in subsequent years.
A different group of people appeared in each of the years under
investigation.
This rather limits the usefulness of the findings when it comes to policy
implications, especially when we note that the level of state benefits for
the poorest has increased by 49 per cent in real terms between 1961 and
1991.

FT  09 JUN 94 / Economic Viewpoint: The zenith of the central banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain this summer is suffering from a surfeit of anniversaries. One of the
grandest is the 300th anniversary of the Bank of England. Central bankers
have always been lavish in mutual appreciation, and 150 other central bank
governors are in London for the occasion. They have been entertained at
Buckingham Palace and attended a closed concert at the Barbican, where they
heard Walton's Belshazzar's Feast: a feast which was interrupted by the
appearance on the wall of the mysterious words 'Mene, Mene, Tekel' and
'Parsin' which foretold the destruction of Babylon. They pay for it all
today by participating in an academic conference on central banking.
The Bank of England is not quite the oldest central bank. The Sverige
Riksbank was founded 26 years earlier in 1668. The Bank of England was the
government's bank from the beginning, as it was established to raise Pounds
1.2m for William of Orange, whose main interest in the English throne was in
the funds it could provide for his native country's war against France.
What gives central banks their unique function is their monopoly of the note
issue and their role of lender of last resort to the commercial banks. The
Bank of England was not a real central bank in its earlier years. It did not
acquire a full monopoly of the note issue until Robert Peel's Bank Charter
Act of 1844, and did not take on full lender of least resort obligations
until the Overend, Gurney crash in the late 1860s.
The most famous governor the Bank has ever had was Montagu Norman, who both
reigned and ruled from 1920 to 1944. Norman became a bete noire in political
circles, as he was blamed for forcing Winston Churchill to return to gold in
1925 at the 1914 parity, and for resistance to Keynes's anti-Depression
policies.
There was no way the Bank could have avoided postwar nationalisation. But
the Bank wasted a golden opportunity in the pre-nationalisation discussions,
when it had a chance to seek clearly defined responsibilities, but confined
its attention to the narrow question of statutory powers over other banks.
As early as 1945, the governor of the Bank of Canada, Graham Towers, wrote
to Lord Keynes: 'The half-way arrangement under which the central bank is
neither a department of government pure and simple, nor directly responsible
to the public for its actions, may contain the worst elements of both
worlds.'
There was then a long postwar period when fiscal and even incomes policy had
precedence over monetary policy. Even when the latter came back into favour,
central bankers were hamstrung by official insistence that they stick to
monetary rules by which they were unconvinced.
Central bankers are now, however, at a peak of prestige, having benefited
from the widespread loss of faith in governments. The last word in
mainstream economic wisdom is that it is credibility, rather than targets,
that matter; and this is best achieved by leaving central banks independent
of government control to achieve price stability by methods of their own
choice. But, like Belshazzar, they will be hard pressed to sustain their
present eminence. Although they have gained in relation to governments, they
have lost in relation to markets.
How do central banks intend to carry out their monetary responsibilities?
Michael Prowse explained in the Financial Times on Monday that the Fed
operates according to two unpublished rules: it will raise short-term
interest rates if real economic growth appears likely to exceed the annual 2
1/2 to 3 per cent it regards as sustainable; and it will also raise them if
inflation shows any sign of rising above the current level of just under 3
per cent.
Mervyn King of the Bank of England has explained explicitly that the Bank's
policy is based on a projection of where the inflation rate will be in two
years. Meanwhile, the Bundesbank sticks to targets for a wide measure of
money, but is prepared to override them.
These guidelines may be better than the political instincts of governments;
but can we be at all confident that they will stabilise either the financial
system or the economy? Indeed, central banks seem more and more to follow
the lead given by bond markets rather than take the initiative.
Indeed, some analysts are suggesting that the whole development of central
banking has been a mistake. There was always a free banking school that
queried the central bank monopoly of the note issue. This has been joined in
modern times by advocates of currency competition, not only between national
currencies, but between private enterprise ones as well. 'Why should banking
be treated differently from any other industry?' has been the cry.
Until recently I had been put off the free banking movement because its
members had no reply to two questions:
What prevents the competitive supply of money today, given that the official
restrictions apply only to notes and coin, and that the overwhelming part of
the money supply consists of deposits and financial liabilities of various
kinds?
How can the unregulated banks, say of Scotland in the early 19th century
whose experience is so frequently cited, really have been competitive
suppliers of money when their notes were convertible into gold and silver,
which were then seen as true currency?
I have, however, at last discovered an economist, David Glasner*, who faces
these questions head on, without a trace of the crankiness which often
affects writers of this school.
The author's answer to the first question is to accept that financial
markets can and do create many different kinds of money, even though that
money is denominated in terms of the coin of the realm. He cites the
development of the Euro-currency markets as an outstanding example. His
argument with the central banks is that these developments should be
accepted, not fought Canute-like.
But in contrast to many free bankers, he accepts that there must be a stable
non-inflationary form of base currency into which reputable bankers should
be prepared ultimately to convert their deposits. He proposes, following
many turn-of-the-century economists such as Alfred Marshall and Irving
Fisher, an adjusted Gold Standard whereby government currency becomes once
more convertible into gold, but at varying rates calculated to stabilise the
general price level.
Obviously the idea needs more analysis. Meanwhile the heretics provide
persuasive critiques of the habit of monetary authorities of underwriting
bank deposits, whether through credit insurance or bailing out individual
banks like Continental Illinois, and extracting a quid pro quo in the shape
of banking supervision. It is this combination which enables central bankers
to go around as grave-faced financial overseers concerned with so much more
than the mere interest rate decisions that engage their economists.
A free banking perspective has the advantage of ending the artificial
distinction between discussions about monetary policy conducted as in church
and real world bankers' concerns about where to extend operations and where
to contract them. The heretical insight is that, given the right
institutional structure, banking can be treated like any other industry and
the amount of deposit money and other financial liabilities left to ordinary
competitive forces. If we rely too much on the central bankers' discretion,
we will find that our emperors are without any clothes.

FT  09 JUN 94 / Arts: The Washington Ballet - Dance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Enter, blowing its own trumpet rather too loudly - 'twenty-two beautifully
trained dancers; one of the most exciting and imaginative repertories of any
ballet company performing today' - the Washington Ballet. What I saw at its
London debut on Tuesday night was a small ensemble, whose women have a
decent academic style, trapped in ballets which leave no cliche unexplored
and are an invitation to immediate flight from the theatre.
The evening began with a new work by Graham Lustig, the troupe's resident
choreographer. Hearts of Light is set to Tippett's Corelli fantasy, music
which I find claustrophobically busy, as if one were trapped in a small room
with an over-vivacious companion. Lustig, always sensitive to his scores,
has produced dances of a kind generally called 'lyrical' - the girls wear
drifting skirts - and has sought to match every convolution of the music.
The result is carefully crafted but relentlessly active, and nothing is
helped by imprisoning the dance in a black surround. Six girls dash and
drift. Three men are in attendance, lifting and being earnest, like
well-mannered furniture removers. It lasts forever.
Things thereafter rushed into Gadarene decline. There was no point, because
no illustrative vitality, in Christopher Doyle's Ne me quitte pas, where
Doyle, in shirt and trousers, gloomed after Francoise Thouveny in a little
black dress, while a tiresome song by Jacques Brel took its course. It was
followed by Quartet No. 2 in which Nils Christe nailed some angst on to
Shostakovich's second string quartet. This is music too serious to be
maltreated as a guide to despair from Mittel-Europa. Christe is a follower
of Jiri Kylian, and the piece is another of those 'Bad news from the Old
Country' exercises in which girls in dull dresses have hell with their men
friends. At the end, the four members of the cast, having suffered all over
the stage, stand in a blaze of light as if awaiting a firing-squad. The
marksmen would do better to draw a bead on Christe.
Last, and by every means least, In the Glow of the Night by Choo San Goh. I
have reported over the years on Choo's creations, which never struck me as
being choreography. Like the ten dollar Patek Philippe watches you find in
the Orient, they bear a slight resemblance to the real thing, but they don't
work. Choo was for some years the creative force for the Washington Ballet -
which explains a thing or two - and In the Glow of the Night is dreadful on
all counts. Three movements from Martinu's first symphony, pink and blue
leotards, pointless activity, are the ingredients. The lighting changes on
an amorphous backdrop, but nothing changes in the trumpery steppings and
emotings that occupy the cast: rodomontade and witless posturings are their
lot. Worse, the dance makes its performers look inept: seven men slog
through academic steps; the women seem prissy. It is no advertisement for
the company's hopes or attainments.

FT  09 JUN 94 / Arts: Face the music and skate - Can Torvill and Dean go
beyond the competition stakes?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Torvill and Dean are competing, as everybody knows, their artistry
transcends competition. When they are giving professional performances,
however, you realise that competition is what they most need. For it is
competition, ironically, that brings out their best artistry.
Some half-dozen of the duets they have created for competition are classics
 -potently expressive images of male-female partnership on a level rare in
any art, and unique in their genre. And they themselves are a rare
partnership. What a curious partnership, though - for they are only
interesting when together. Astaire and Rogers, Fonteyn and Nureyev, Sibley
and Dowell were all supreme soloists too, who could sustain major careers
apart from each other. Not so Torvill and Dean - who, apart from each other
even for a minute or two, are unremarkable either as personalities or as ice
dancers. Their new world tour gives them very little solo exposure, but just
enough - in a Beatles anthology, Paperback Sixties - to prove this.
And they are not an invariably thrilling partnership; the duet that finally
brings them together at the climax of this Beatles collection is fairly
blah. You cannot even say (as Katherine Hepburn said of Astaire and Rogers)
that she gives him sex while he gives her class.
The Midas touch that sometimes turns these two pleasant but uninspiring
individuals into a joint icon of the sublime is the tight specifications of
competitive ice dancing: never more than a yard apart from each other; no
flamboyantly high lifts; a steady supply of virtuosity amid a non-stop
flowing legato journey around the ice . . . It is now more than 12 years
since Torvill and Dean first took those challenging limitations and turned
them into a transporting image of the inseparability of man and woman.
If there is just one thing that sets them apart from other ice partnerships,
it is musicality. (Why is this so rare on ice?) As the climax of another big
ensemble piece to music from Orff's Carmina Burana, they dance a duet, 'In
Trutina.' Not on their best level throughout, but with some long and
heartstopping phrases wedded to the flow and peaks of phrases in the music.
At one peak, Dean holds her high, and her gesture into the air above exactly
hits its climax with the music; and then, while the same phrase continues,
Dean lowers her and holds her, immobile and horizontal, like a steel bar
across his chest; and the phrase contains other marvels too.
The choreography is credited to Torvill, Dean, and Andris Toppe. Nineteen
other skaters are involved, in solos, duets and larger ensembles. The mood
keeps changing from comedy to virtuosity to lyricism; a Strictly Skating
medley makes some OK jokes about the usual tackiness of ballroom forms on
ice in very Strictly Ballroom vein; and the evening's programme is a
passable mix of showbiz and acrobatics. The naffest excess of ice dance are
avoided; but its rare potential for poetry is only present in the T &amp; D
duets.
But there are too many jokes about competition marks, too many references to
competition triumphs. Years ago, John Curry swept straight out of
competition format to prove himself a major lyricist on ice, and built up a
company of likeminded skaters. Can Torvill and Dean go beyond their
competition successes? The pattern of their career - and the fact that all
their best numbers have been made for competition  - suggests not.
This programme begins with the Bolero, includes History of Love and a medley
of Barnum, the Paso Doble, and Mack and Mabel, and ends with Let's Face the
Music and Dance.
Musicality apart, Torvill and Dean are an outstanding choreographic example
of male-female cooperation. Whether in the sweeping tragic glory of Bolero
or the chugging robust vivacity of Mack and Mabel, you can see how often
Torvill propels Dean as well as vice versa. Often they become intricately
interdependent. In one phrase of Bolero she arches back over his body,
facing up to the ceiling, and yet it is her feet, lightly running on point,
that are propelling them both. Breathtaking, no matter how often you see it,
and seriously moving.

It would be an insult to most reporters to describe their programmes as a
'meander' around their subjects, yet it seems quite reasonable and not the
least damaging when it is Wooldridge On Whisky. Wooldridge is so laid back
and such a natural raconteur that virtually any subject he covers is sure to
be entertaining without any of that straining for drama which you usually
get on television. Sure enough, the opening episode was funny and seemingly
effortless; invariably the mark of hard work (8.00 BBC2). At 9.30 Channel 4
repeats the remarkable interview with the late Dennis Potter first shown on
Without Walls in April. At that point Potter was staying alive on vitamins,
cigarettes, and the liquid morphine which he swigged from a flask as he
talked to Melvyn Bragg. I suspect that you get the truth about Potter's
beliefs from his dramas, but this interview reveals as much about Potter the
man as any programme ever achieved. The colour film shot by George Stevens
as he advanced from Normandy to Berlin in 1944/45 provides a unique record
which BBC2 repeats in D-Day To Berlin (9.45).

FT  09 JUN 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Vitra's vision in
glass and stone - Why the office furniture group sees the architecture of
its buildings as part of corporate culture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An anxious American hovers outside a bizarre, but beautiful building in an
otherwise unexceptional suburb of Basle. He is an architect on business in
Switzerland, he explains, has come specially to see the building and wants
to look inside.
The object of his obsession was designed by Frank Gehry, the North American
architect, for Vitra, the office furniture group which is one of the
finalists in the 1994 European Union Design Prize due to be awarded tomorrow
in Amsterdam. The building opened last month as Vitra's corporate
headquarters and is the latest addition to the stunning collection of
contemporary architecture it has built at its main manufacturing site in
Weil-am-Rhein, just over the border in Germany.
The American's fascination with the new headquarters building is as intense
as the interest generated by the Weil complex, which attracts 40,000
visitors each year: many of whom are architects or students who might
eventually buy Vitra's products.
The complex contains the work of some of the world's most influential
architects. There are two factories by Britain's Nicholas Grimshaw, a
conference centre by Tadao Ando of Japan and a Frank Gehry museum to house
the company's 20th century chair collection. Even the fire station is an
architectural gem - a spectacular composition of abstract concrete planes
devised by Zaha Hadid, an Iraqi architect working in London.
Rolf Fehlbaum, chairman of Vitra, is a self-confessed architecture buff yet
says the Weil site is not a self-indulgent exercise but an integral part of
Vitra's strategy of establishing itself as a leader in the office furniture
market. 'This isn't a folly or a fantasy,' he says. 'It's part of the
company's culture. It's a financially feasible project which sends out a
clear message to our customers about what the company stands for.'
Vitra's building binge began in 1981 when part of the original Weil site was
destroyed by fire. The company, founded in 1934 by Fehlbaum's father, was
then the European manufacturer for Hermann Miller, the US furniture group.
It had already commissioned a few office chairs from contemporary designers
and in the early 1980s was preparing to end the agreement with Miller to
concentrate on developing its own designs.
The new Vitra needed to carve out an independent identity. The Fehlbaums,
impressed by Miller's long liaison with influential designers such as
Charles and Ray Eames, were determined to place Vitra at the forefront of
technical and aesthetic innovation and needed to convince contemporary
designers of the same calibre as the Eameses to work with them.
The reconstruction of the Weil site became a central element in that
strategy. Rolf Fehlbaum deliberately commissioned a special set of
buildings. The Vitra complex includes the first European buildings of Frank
Gehry and Tadao Ando. It also houses the first permanent buildings by Zaha
Hadid and Nicholas Grimshaw. Fehlbaum says the total cost of the factories
(including architect's fees) was roughly the same as standard buildings of
that type: but admits the Hadid fire station and Ando conference centre were
more expensive at DM2.6m (Pounds 1.04m) and DM2.5m respectively.
Vitra has already recouped some of its investment. The museum, which cost
DM2.5m to build in 1989, now earns two thirds of its running costs. Vitra
also attracts a steady stream of publicity in the architectural press from
the opening of new buildings or museum events.
'It's impossible to assess the impact of our cultural project, although we
know it has made a difference,' says Fehlbaum. He is convinced that it has
played a critical part in enabling Vitra to quadruple its turnover since the
break with Hermann Miller to SFr210m last year from SFr56m (Pounds 26m) in
1984.
'The project has smoothed the way by helping us establish our name,' he
adds. 'Our customers know exactly where we stand and how to relate to us.
Other companies spend lots of money on advertising. We think this is a more
effective way of communicating our message.'
In this respect Vitra's iconoclastic architecture plays a similar role to
the conventional arts sponsorship schemes aimed at developing brands.
Cartier, the French jeweller, has pursued the same aims as Vitra by becoming
an active sponsor of contemporary art, culminating in this spring's opening
of Fondation Cartier, a Paris arts centre designed by Jean Nouvel, the
futuristic French architect.
Whereas Cartier tends to treat its arts schemes as an image-building
initiative, Vitra has gone further by fusing its cultural activities with
its day-to-day operations. The elan of its architecture has helped it to
attract sought-after furniture designers such as Philippe Starck, Jasper
Morrison and Ettore Sottsass. 'If Rolf Fehlbaum wants a new factory or a
fire station he goes to the best people in the world,' says Starck.
'Everything about Vitra is done to the highest possible standard. That's why
I work for it.'
Fehlbaum also believes that the company's product development skills have
been enhanced by the experience of collaborating with different architects.
'Designing an office chair is a complex process of trial and error that
requires a great deal of fine-tuning,' he says. 'It's good for us to work
with different people.'
Similarly Vitra has benefited from the museum, which has not only encouraged
employees to learn more about their industry's history but has acted as a
catalyst for long-term research. Vitra last year asked Sottsass and two
other Italian designers, Andrea Branzi and Michele de Lucchi, to analyse how
technology would affect the offices of the future for a Citizen Office
exhibition.
'Vitra is a company with vision,' says Starck. 'It's never satisfied with
the present and is always looking to the future.'

FT  09 JUN 94 / Technology: Shop-till-you-drop at the touch of a button -
Electronic retailing is set to revolutionise buying. Richard Tomkins begins
a new series with a glimpse into the future of the interactive era
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Damn, Michael thinks, thumping the vehicle's control panel. It is a sunny
Sunday morning and he is driving out of town to visit his parents. But
suddenly, it occurs to him: it is Father's Day and he has forgotten to buy a
present. What to do?
Stopping the car, he reaches forward, flicks a switch and watches a screen
light up. 'Computer,' he says, 'it is Father's Day. Suggest a present for my
father.'
'A tie,' a disembodied voice replies.
'Oh, most original. Why?'
'He bought a suit on May 20.'
'Yes, and he bought a tie to match it.'
'Incorrect. He bought two.'
Michael thumps the control panel. 'Well, then, what in heaven's name is the
point of buying him another?'
'He liked three.'
'All right,' Michael sighs. 'Show the tie he wanted, but didn't buy.' Pause.
'Show it worn by my father, with the suit.'
The tie is expensive: the computer's records say this is why his father
didn't buy it. But it looks good with the suit . . . very good. It should do
the trick.
'Show locations in this area where I can pick up this tie now.' The names
and addresses of three outlets appear, the last of them only a short way off
Michael's planned route.
'Order this selection. Gift wrap for Father's Day. I'll collect at pick-up
point three in 30 minutes. Charge to Visa. Oh, and computer?'
'Yes?'
'Shut up.'
This is shopping in the 21st century: when the trudge round the stores has
been replaced by the speed and convenience of computer-aided selection in
the home, car or office. Retailing in the traditional sense will long since
have given way to fibre optic cables and multi-media technology.
Or will it? Shops may have changed over the years, but their fundamental
role as places where people go to choose and buy goods is almost as old as
civilisation itself. Are they really to be made redundant by electronic
retailing?
Right now, it may not seem so. True, home shopping is already a reality in
the US, but it is a primitive affair. Programmes offered by the two main
home shopping channels, Home Shopping Network and QVC, simply parade goods
in front of viewers in the hope that something might take their fancy, and
take credit card orders by telephone. They account for less than 0.2 per
cent of US retail sales.
But this may be about to change. With US telephone and cable television
companies investing billions of dollars to provide Americans with two-way
data communication, consumers will no longer be the passive recipients of
sales pitches for goods that do not interest them. Soon, they will be able
to tell their television sets to show them things they want to buy, and
order them at the touch of a button.
In the early days of this interactive era, a typical home shopping channel
will probably allow consumers to enter an electronic shopping mall featuring
a number of stores selling different kinds of merchandise. Viewers will
select the store they want to enter; choose the department that interests
them; go to the items they want to view; then, after calling up any product
information they require, press a button to transmit an order.
Very soon, the system will move on to a more sophisticated level by building
up personal profiles of users through their buying habits. For example, it
will quickly learn viewers' measurements, so enabling it to order clothing
in the correct size.
It will also pick up their favourite colours and their tastes in fashion,
music, or food, so that it can offer increasingly tempting products while
learning not to waste their time with unwanted goods. It will have a pretty
accurate idea of what they can afford, too.
Beyond this, it does not require a great leap of imagination to see the day
when virtual reality enters the world of electronic retailing. At a simple
level, consumers will be able to try on clothes at home by watching
computer-generated images of themselves (or indeed, someone else) wearing
them. Later, instead of watching a television screen, people will probably
be able to don a virtual reality helmet and gloves, then transport
themselves into the stores of their choice. They will roam the virtual
aisles, examining virtual goods and quizzing virtual sales assistants for
more information if required.
But what of traditional shops? Will a place remain for them in this
interactive era?
The answer is almost certainly yes, for at least three reasons. One is that
there are many goods that people will still prefer to touch and feel, or try
on for size, before purchasing. Another is that, until science devises a
method of transporting matter instantly through space, electronic shoppers
will still have to suffer the frustration of waiting for their goods to be
delivered. And a third is that, in a world where so many work and leisure
activities are conducted through a television screen, people may simply go
crazy if they are left without an excuse for getting out of their homes.
Equally, however, it seems certain that shops will change. The accountancy
firm Coopers &amp; Lybrand, which recently conducted a Dollars 1m (Pounds
600,000) survey of the outlook for retailing in the 21st century, predicts
that stores will respond to the threat from home shopping by combining
retailing with entertainment.
If, as seems likely, this proposition is correct, the US already offers a
glimpse of the future in the form of Mall of America, a vast complex on the
outskirts of Minneapolis combining 400 stores with a seven-acre theme park.
But on a smaller scale, food stores might offer cookery lessons, record
stores might offer live music, or clothing stores might offer fashion shows.
This, of course, will take up space. But according to Jacquelyn Bivvins,
marketing manager of Coopers &amp; Lybrand's retail programme in New York, this
is something retailers will have in abundance. As with electronic shopping,
detailed analysis of customers' buying habits will allow retailers to build
up much more accurate pictures of who their customers are and what they
want. The result will be a big reduction in inventory on the sales floor.
Another space-saver could be manufacturing at the point of sale. Customers
at branches of Blockbuster Entertainment, the US video store group, are
already selecting compact discs or video games and having them made while
they wait. Bivvins sees no reason why shirts, to take a random example, or a
myriad other goods, should not eventually be custom-made to order on the
spot.
Technology will bring other changes, too. Those who today complain that they
can never find a sales assistant when they want one will probably never see
one at all in the next century: instead, they will turn to an on-screen
electronic assistant for advice. Men might pick a suit and ask the screen to
show them images of all the shirts in the store that go with it. Women might
go to the hairdresser and ask the screen to show them what they would look
like with different hairstyles.
Arguably, the form of retailing that could change the most is the
supermarket - not least because it is the format most likely to suffer from
the home shopping revolution. The mind-numbing task of replenishing the
larder with basic foodstuffs is perhaps the one that lends itself most
easily to substitution by technology. In the interactive age, it will be a
simple matter for householders to order goods electronically for home
delivery, and have the same order repeated automatically every week unless
amended or cancelled.
Supermarkets, however, will undoubtedly use technology to fight back. For
example, customers will no longer be required to load up trolleys with
goods. Instead, stores will display just one example of each product, and
customers will walk around the store with an electronic wand, waving it
across a barcode on the shelf to order and pay for each item. The order will
be put together by automatic shelf pickers behind the scenes, and the
customer will either pick it up at the exit or have it delivered.
Things may turn out rather differently. Carol Farmer, whose Florida-based
company Carol Farmer Associates forecasts consumer trends, thinks people
could become so exhausted by the bombardment of visual information coming to
them through their screens that they could begin to view conventional
shopping as an escape.
Consumers may welcome the prospect of wandering around a quiet, relaxed,
screen-free store with real humans on hand to help and advise, she says.
'The atmosphere will be deliberately calming, the environment will be very
soothing, because everybody will be visually brain-dead from all this
virtual shopping that they can do if they want to. This sort of shopping
will be the antithesis of it.'
It also makes sense to be cautious when it comes to some of the wilder
prognostications about the interactive future. As Farmer puts it: 'I think
the trend towards this kind of technology is unstoppable, but it really does
depend on the makers' ability to make it user-friendly, and they haven't
been very good at that in the past.
'I mean, it's still very hard to program a VCR, and VCRs have been around
for years.'

FT  09 JUN 94 / Technology: Plastics get tough
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Construction costs could be reduced by hundreds of millions of pounds
through the use of a new generation of plastic-based composite materials
which are as strong as steel and concrete but much lighter and easier to
handle.
A group of UK companies, led by engineering consultants Mouchel, are
combining to study the practicality of using polymers reinforced with carbon
and glass fibre to strengthen bridges.
They claim it would be possible to save Pounds 130m by using carbon fibre
polymers instead of steel to strengthen 1,000 out of the estimated 10,800
British bridges that will require reinforcing to meet European Union
40-tonne weight restrictions.
The three-year study, costing Pounds 1m, has attracted Pounds 425,000 of
government finance under the Link Programme which supports collaborative
research between industry and universities.
Mouchel is providing 60 per cent of the private-sector contribution with
GEC, the big British engineering group, providing a further Pounds 100,000.
If the project develops a practical technology, it could promote export
orders as well as rebuilding an important part of the country's
infrastructure.
The companies, which will be working with Surrey and Oxford Brookes
universities, will be seeking to build on work by Urs Meier of the Swiss
Federal Laboratories for Materials Testing and Research who demonstrated in
the mid-1980s that it was possible to double the strength of a 150mm
concrete beam by adding a 0.3mm carbon fibre reinforced polymer strip.
A subsequent study by Brookes University showed that a 2.3-metre concrete
span with a depth of 150mm could increase its carrying capacity by 230 per
cent with addition of a 0.8mm reinforced polymer strip.

FT  09 JUN 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Time for companies
to ring the changes - Businesses have not caught up with increased consumer
confidence over telephone use
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The telephone, as a marketing tool, has come of age. This may seem strange,
given that the 'phone has been around for about 100 years and looks like old
technology next to interactive superhighways and all the other
communications developments on the horizon.
But it is only now, according to a study* on 'phone potential for business
in the UK by the Henley Centre forecasting group, that telephone technology
'has finally reached critical mass in terms of consumer confidence, use and
attitudes towards it'.
The trouble is, reports Henley, that businesses have not caught up with this
development in 'teleculture': they continue to make customers hang on,
subjecting them to unwanted music and then 'ping-ponging' them between
departments.
First Direct, Next and Direct Line are among the exceptions to have seen the
potential for telephone-based businesses, says Henley. In the financial
services sector alone, previous studies have suggested that as many as 30m
calls a year are abandoned by customers who get fed up with waiting or who
are met with unhelpful staff. Melanie Howard, Henley's head of direct
marketing studies, says: 'The amount of business companies are throwing away
must be enormous. We found, for example, that only 14 per cent of people
would definitely call back if they couldn't get through when responding to
an advertisement.'
Overall, Henley reports that interviews with 500 senior managers across a
range of sectors show 'there is little evidence that despite spending an
estimated Pounds 10bn per annum on telephone contact, in sales, marketing or
customer service functions, and employing nearly 1m dedicated telephone
staff, that any more than a few companies are experiencing the real benefits
reported by the more advanced users - increased customer loyalty, revenue
maximisation and a competitive edge'.
Evidence that the 'teleculture' has finally arrived among consumers in the
UK ('phone usage in the US is about four times greater) comes from group
discussions and interviews with 1,000 consumers conducted in March for
Henley. As would be expected, professionals and more affluent households are
more likely to enjoy using the 'phone and employ it to buy goods and
services. However, individual attitudes to the 'phone cut across
socio-economic groupings and are more significant in predicting usage, found
Henley.
Four distinct groups were identified:
Telephiles, who make up 47 per cent of consumers, are confident and frequent
users of the 'phone to do business. They are relatively positive about being
called by companies, as long as they can see something in it for themselves.
They agree more than other groups that they would buy again from a company
that keeps in touch, that companies should check to find out if customers
are satisfied and should ask consumers for their opinions of new products
and services.
Telephobes, 16 per cent of 'phone users, use the 'phone as little as
possible and are more likely to be younger and more downmarket. Fewer of
them work full time. They are particularly negative about receiving calls
from companies.
Functionals, 15 per cent of the market, do not positively enjoy the 'phone
as much as telephiles but are confident and prepared to use it socially, at
work and to obtain goods and services. Two-thirds of this group were men.
Protectionists, 22 per cent of users, are, says Henley, 'people who are
generally positive about using the telephone but who do not want a two-way
relationship with businesses'. They see little value in companies keeping in
touch with their customers or seeking their opinions, whether through the
'phone or not.
Businesses greatly overestimate the resistance among consumers to the
telephone, says Henley, and there is even evidence that dislike of 'cold
calls' is receding. Nearly three-quarters of users say that getting an
immediate answer on the 'phone is top of their list of priorities, yet most
companies - even those with teams to deal with customer queries, and who are
using advanced equipment or special telephone numbers - continue to put all
calls through their general switchboards.
Overall, Henley finds that, while consumer demand for good telephone
services is high, customers' expectations are low. 'This suggests that
businesses can relatively easily improve the service they provide over the
'phone, and to do so would have a very positive impact on consumers.'

FT  09 JUN 94 / Accountancy Column: Irish institute plays the game at both
ends - The lessons to be learned from a professional body spanning either
side of the border
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Among the handful of issues on which those on both sides of the Irish border
see eye-to-eye is a holy trinity of rugby, the Catholic church and - most
surprisingly - accountancy.
Like the sport and the religious hierarchy, the profession pre-dates
partition in 1922. With barriers since going up to divide north from south
on so many topics, there is a strong case for those from outside the region
to pay a little more attention to its experiences.
The Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland, the largest body in the
region, bears the highly unusual responsibility of representing the
profession in two countries. It is an arrangement that requires regular
commuting, with offices in both Dublin and Belfast and the council rotating
its meetings between the two cities.
Ask Mr Joe Gannon, a partner in Gilroy Gannon, a practice based in Sligo and
the newly appointed president of the institute, what distinguishes it from
its rivals in the UK, and he pauses briefly for thought. Then a proud list
begins of differences and precedents that have since trickled across the
Irish sea.
Take training in industry, a programme designed to allow chartered
accountants to train outside public practice. Begun in 1983, the scheme
currently operates for more than 60 students in an equivalent number of
companies and government bodies. The idea has since been copied much more
recently by the UK's chartered accountancy institutes, where it still
remains proportionately far smaller.
Take, as a more recent example, finances, given that the institute managed
to generate a surplus in its latest accounts to December 1993, compared with
deficits at some of its leading competitor bodies.
However, one of the most important and often over-looked contributions of
the institute was a small green document published in January 1992, 11
months before the Cadbury report on the financial aspects of corporate
governance captured the headlines when it was launched in London.
The report by the commission of inquiry into the expectations of users of
published financial statements - commonly known as the Ryan commission after
its chairman - deserves a wider readership. Its remit was far wider than
Cadbury, its recommendations more radical and its work more prompt in
response to criticisms of the quality of published financial information.
The commission suggested that accounts should contain a statement of
auditors' and directors' responsibilities (something since introduced in the
UK by the Auditing Practices Board) which would include commentary on the
state of internal financial controls (a topic still under debate following
similar recommendations in Cadbury).
It called for the creation wherever possible of audit committees - ideally
composed solely of non-executive directors - charged with overseeing
financial reporting and internal controls, and (going further than Cadbury)
ensuring the external auditors act independently of management.
The report called for full disclosure of directors' remuneration in the
annual report, and for a detailed commentary in the chief executive's review
of trends, uncertainties and plans (now endorsed in the operating and
financial review guidelines issued last year by the Accounting Standards
Board).
One area in which it borrowed from the UK was the suggestion that Ireland
should set up its own Financial Reporting Review Panel, in line with the
equivalent watchdog of the accounts of public limited companies in the UK.
This is still being pursued by a committee of the Irish government created
to examine revisions to company law.
A disappointment of the institute is the slow or neglected implementation of
the Ryan Commission. The report recommended that the review panel publish a
report on cases of companies whose accounting it investigated (rather than
the brief public statement on companies found guilty as in the UK).
It called for the auditors to comment explicitly on the company's solvency
at the balance sheet date, and for publication of their report to the audit
committee if the company collapsed within 12 months after the date of an
unqualified audit report.
It also wanted preliminary and interim statements to be audited (a proposal
being examined in the UK), and a reduction of the maximum gross fees payable
to a firm from 15 per cent to 5 per cent of total income. None of these
radical ideas has since been introduced.
Perhaps an even more significant Irish invention now finding resonances in
the UK has been 'practice review'.
While the UK bodies began to respond to the need for audit regulation
following the 1989 Companies Act, the Irish opted to begin a voluntary
system of visiting all 1,200 accountancy practitioners every five years back
in 1987.
It drew on the experiences of the Ontario Institute's approach in Canada.
Since then it used this approach, which has since also been more reflected
by the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants than the Joint
Monitoring Unit, which covers the chartered bodies.
'Inspection is a bad word,' says Mr Eugene MacMahon, head of the unit of
three staff. 'We consider ourselves educational and supportive. Members
voted us in. This wasn't supposed to be a crusade to nail people to the
cross, but a road to Damascus.'
Although the figures have not been made public, it is believed that
something like one-third of practitioners initially required a follow-up
visit after staff identified flaws in their auditing that needed improvement
 -most typically a failure to document partners' decisions.
However, only six practitioners have been disciplined, and those firms
requiring follow-up visits during the second round of inspections - now
under way for two years - have roughly halved.
It is a softly-softly approach that has been since endorsed in a recent
report on UK audit regulation commissioned by the Department of Trade and
Industry, and one which the Irish government has decided is well-suited to
EU requirements for monitoring of the profession.
Looking forward, one of the top issues on Mr Gannon's agenda during the
coming year in office is the consolidation of the profession, the most
recent manifestation of which is the report of the working party chaired by
Mr David Bishop of KPMG Peat Marwick, which earlier this year recommended an
amalgamation of the six leading bodies.
'There is a perception that it is an English battle fought on Irish soil,'
says Mr Roger Hussey, the chief executive of the institute. 'The last
example of that was the battle of the Boyne and we don't want a repeat of
that.'
In Ireland, by contrast, Mr Gannon says the debate is less heated and there
is a mood in favour of consolidation. 'Bishop has given us the opportunity
to talk in a calm atmosphere,' he says.
This harmony comes in spite of the fact that the challenge should be
greater, given not only the cross-border issues but also the presence of an
additional professional body. All are co-ordinated by an Irish equivalent of
the UK's consultative committee of accountancy bodies (which Mr Hussey was
restrained from dubbing 'mini-CCAB').
Overall, it is too bad that there are not more examples in the broader
political sphere of the innovative thought and co-operation between the UK
and Ireland as accountancy seems to have fostered.

FT  09 JUN 94 / Housing starts increase by 4.6%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Housebuilding figures published yesterday by the government show no sign of
the recent slowdown in recovery in the housing market reported by some
mortgage lenders and estate agents.
The figures, however, cover a period before the impact of tax increases in
April and the ending of some of the cheaper fixed-rate mortgages would have
been felt.
More recent indications from builders suggest that the rate of improvement
in new-house sales, although still higher than a year ago, has slowed in
recent weeks.
This has not affected output so far, according to the figures from the
Department of the Environment. These show that the total number of new homes
on which construction started rose by 4.6 per cent during the three months
to the end of April, compared with the corresponding period last year.
Total starts were also 6 per cent higher than during the previous three
months. The figures have been seasonally adjusted to avoid distortions.
According to the department, private-sector starts were 5 per cent higher
than the previous three months and 10 per cent higher than at the same time
last year. Starts made on homes for housing associations were 10 per cent
higher and 11 per cent lower respectively.
House sales traditionally start to decline in the summer before picking up
in the autumn. Estate agents and building societies, however, are worried
that public concern over interest rates is undermining fragile confidence.
Bank of England figures last week showed a 14 per cent drop in new net
mortgage lending.
The total number of transactions in the housing market increased by 25 per
cent in the six months to March, compared with the same period in the
previous year, says a report by the Valuation Office, an Inland Revenue
agency.
House prices rose by an average of 0.66 per cent over the six months. The
performance of different regions ranged from no movement in the north-west,
south-west and west Midlands to a 2 per cent rise in the east Midlands.

FT  09 JUN 94 / Unions to appeal on injury scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Eleven unions are to appeal against last month's High Court decision that
the abolishing of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme by the
government was lawful.
Their solicitors said yesterday that the unions 'consider the case of great
constitutional importance and are extremely concerned about the consequences
for its members who are daily exposed to the risks of violent attack whilst
doing their jobs'.
The new compensation regulations that came into force in April, without the
need for parliamentary approval, established a strict tariff where the
victim's loss of earnings is no longer taken into account.
The unions involved are Unison, the public-service union; the Fire Brigades'
Union; the Royal College of Nursing; the Prison Officers' Association;
Aslef, the train drivers' union; the CSPA civil-service union; the NatWest
Staff Association, the NASUWT teaching union; the TGWU and GMB general
unions and the Trades Union Congress.
The unions insist Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, is abusing his
powers by failing to give statutory effect to the more generous compensation
scheme approved in the Criminal Justice Act 1988.

<TEXT>
The Arab Organisation for Industrialisation has paid a further Pounds 115m
to Westland Helicopters, taking the legal tussle between the manufacturer
and several Arab governments a step forward.
The case followed the collapse of an Egyptian-based helicopter manufacturing
project in 1979. The organisation was set up by Saudi Arabia, Qatar, United
Arab Emirates and Egypt to make Lynx helicopters under licence. A year ago
the Geneva-based Arbitral Tribunal, which deals with international disputes,
put the damages owed to Westland at Pounds 385m. A payment of Pounds 25m was
made in February.

FT  09 JUN 94 / Power-line link to cancer 'possible'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Childhood cancers may be linked to electromagnetic fields and an inquiry is
needed to investigate the possibility, a National Radiological Protection
Board advisory group, chaired by leading cancer specialist Sir Richard Doll,
said yesterday.
Its announcement followed a review of several Scandinavian studies into
claims that exposure to the electromagnetic fields surrounding power cables
might cause cancer.
But the board stressed that the chances of a link were small. Parents who
claim their children have either died from or suffered leukaemia and brain
tumours due to radiation from power cables are taking court action against
electricity suppliers.

FT  09 JUN 94 / German growth rate beaten
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's manufacturing productivity growth was 'superior' to that of
Germany during 1979-1989, claims a study of productivity in the two
countries over the past 30 years, Robert Taylor writes.
The report, published yesterday by the National Institute of Economic and
Social Research, was based on 30 industrial sectors. It says that 'at the
level of individual manufacturing industries, Germany does not so clearly
dominate Britain, except in the period from 1973 to 1979'.
It adds: 'Almost half the industries showed a superior British productivity
growth performance over the entire three decades to 1989.' Britain still
lags in the number of manufacturing workers with skills; in the volume of
resources devoted to research and development; and in investment in new
plant and machinery.

FT  09 JUN 94 / Output betters market hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Manufacturing output grew by an unexpectedly strong 1.1 per cent in April,
indicating that the economic recovery is still robust, in spite of the
impact of tax rises.
Industrial production, which includes the more volatile oil and gas sector,
was 1.6 per cent higher on the month, according to the Central Statistical
Office. Both figures, which are seasonally adjusted, were well ahead of
market expectations of month-on-month increases of about 0.5 per cent.
However, analysts said that the rise partly reflected a rebound from March,
when both production and output fell. Those declines were revised to 0.6 per
cent and 0.7 per cent yesterday.
Monthly figures are volatile and the CSO prefers to concentrate on
three-monthly averages. These show that manufacturing output was 1.2 per
cent higher in the three months to April than in the previous three months,
while industrial production was 1 per cent ahead. If the three months to
April are compared with the same three months in 1993, manufacturing output
has risen 2.3 per cent, while industrial production is up 4.4 per cent.
In spite of last month's growth, manufacturing output is still about 3.7 per
cent below the its pre-recession levels. Recent revisions to the trade
figures mean that manufacturing output in 1993 is now believed to have been
0.1 per cent lower than previously estimated.
Industrial production is just 0.4 per cent below its peak, reached in June
1990. Its strength is mainly due to oil and gas output, which in April
passed its previous record level set in May 1987. Oil and gas output in the
three months to April was 37.2 per cent higher than in the same period a
year ago. Electricity, gas and water supply output rose 5.9 per cent between
March and April because of colder-than-average temperatures. However, coal
production continued to decline.
Manufacturing output was boosted by a 14.8 per cent surge in coke and
nuclear fuels production, which rebounded after maintenance work in February
and March.

Rising unemployment, falling house prices and shrinking investment have

FT  09 JUN 94 / Commercial property investment market levels out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The commercial property investment market has levelled out after its steep
rise over the past year, Vanessa Houlder writes. The total return from the
property investment market in May was 29 per cent, down on April's 29.3 per
cent, according to the monthly index by Richard Ellis, chartered surveyors.
The decline in the bond market has taken its toll on property, with the
result that capital growth is no longer being driven by declining investment
yields - the ratio of income to capital. Rental growth, which would boost
values, has not yet appeared.
Rents fell in May, after stabilising in previous months. In the office
sector, rents edged down slightly after three months of no rental changes.
The value of offices has fallen slightly for the second successive month.
In the retail sector, rents fell 0.4 per cent in May, in contrast to April
when the sector recorded its first rental growth for three years. In the
industrial sector, rents also fell by 0.4 per cent after being static in
April.

Britain's manufacturing productivity growth was 'superior' to that of
Germany during the period 1979-1989, claims a study of productivity in the
two countries over the past 30 years.
The report, published yesterday by the National Institute of Economic and
Social Research, was based on 30 industrial sectors. It found that 'at the
level of individual manufacturing industries, Germany does not so clearly
dominate Britain, except in the period from 1973 to 1979.
'Almost half the industries showed a superior British productivity growth
performance over the entire three decades to 1989,' it added.
The report said that in 1989, 23 industries had higher productivity levels
in Germany than in Britain, whereas in 1960 Germany had an advantage in only
17 industries.
German manufacturing productivity peaked in superiority in 1979, when only
three industries performed better in Britain - leather and footwear; drink
and tobacco production.
In 1960 labour productivity was only 4 percentage points higher in Germany
than in Britain; by 1973 the gap had widened to 19.4 and six years later to
40 per cent. But by 1989 the difference had narrowed to 16.5 percentage
points.
The study calculates that aggregate labour productivity growth in Germany
from 1960 to 1989 was 'a little less than half a percentage point higher per
year than in Britain'.
However, only six out of the 30 industries covered had a lower productivity
performance in Germany than in Britain in 1989. These were mineral products;
iron and steel; office machinery; electrical engineering; drink and tobacco
production. In 1960, 13 out of the 30 industries had a better level of
labour productivity in Britain.
The largest productivity gap in 1989 was in the printing, publishing and
paper industries where Germany was more than 50 per cent more productive.
German dominance was also clear in ceramic goods manufacture; mechanical
engineering; vehicle production and instrument engineering.
The report attributes the better UK performance in the 1980s to the labour
market freeing itself 'from the worst forms of restrictive practices'.
The report adds that Britain still lags in the number of manufacturing
workers with skills; in the volume of resources devoted to research and
development; and in investment in new plant and machinery. The study found
that in 1989 Germany had 30 per cent more physical capital per worker-hour
in manufacturing than Britain.
