FT  09 JUN 94 / Accounts body chief calls for audits shake-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Auditors should be seen to act more independently of company executives and
public-sector bodies, the chairman of the Accounts Commission of Scotland
said yesterday.
Mr Ian Percy, who is also a senior partner with accountants Grant Thornton,
called for a shake-up in the reporting structures of public and
private-sector auditing in a speech to the conference of the Chartered
Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy.
'The auditor is becoming the tool of the finance officer,' he said after his
speech yesterday. 'There must be mechanisms to ensure that they are auditing
the finance function.'
Mr Percy called for the adoption by public-sector bodies of the
recommendations of the Cadbury committee on the financial aspects of
corporate governance, which was originally aimed at quoted companies.
He said that councils and other public-sector organisations should create
audit committees to improve effectiveness and reporting on financial
matters. Mr Percy called for greater independence of regulation, with the
need for a body separated from the professional accountancy bodies, and with
lay membership to set standards and ethics and to discipline firms.
He said accountancy firms should respond to the perceived threat to
objectivity when auditors provide other services to their clients.
Company audit committees should approve any non-audit work undertaken by the
auditor, he said, while the accountancy firm's audit engagement partner
should not be pressured into cross-selling other services to the client.
Mr Percy also criticised the proposed merger of the UK's six principal
professional accountancy bodies as 'monopolistic'.
In an effort to boost personal responsibility, Mr Percy said the engagement
partner in an accountancy firm should be prepared to sign the audit report
in a company's accounts in his or her own name rather than in the name of
the firm.

FT  09 JUN 94 / Gooda admission on policies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Profits reported in the 1980s by the Gooda Walker agency's syndicate 290
were largely earned by 'time-and-distance' insurance policies, Mr Derek
Walker, the former Gooda Walker chairman, admitted in the High Court
yesterday.
However, he denied he had traded in these policies in an attempt to attract
new Lloyd's Names to his syndicate and so expand his business.
Giving evidence in the High Court action brought against the agency by more
than 3,000 Names, Mr Walker agreed with Mr Geoffrey Vos QC that his dealing
in the policies had helped the spectacular growth of syndicate 290 in the
1980s.
Time-and-distance policies are a form of reinsurance to allow syndicates to
manage reserves against claims several years after the start of policies.
Mr Walker agreed that their use had boosted the syndicates' reported profits
in 1981 to Pounds 2.5m from a Pounds 700,000 loss on all other business. In
1987 they took a Pounds 2.4m profit up to Pounds 8.1m, he agreed.
The use of such policies by syndicate 290 had come as a surprise in parts of
the Lloyd's market and had only been clearly disclosed in 1987, Mr Vos said.
Mr Walker replied that the time-and-distance dealings had been disclosed to
auditors preparing the syndicate's accounts.
Earlier, Mr Walker denied he had been driven to build up syndicate 290 to
prove his ability to the market following his Old Bailey trial in 1981 when
he was accused of conspiracy and eventually acquitted.
Mr Vos asked him whether he had been aware that Mr Peter Green, then Lloyd's
chairman, had opposed his return to the insurance market following his
trial. Mr Walker said he had been unaware of this. The case continues on
Monday.

FT  09 JUN 94 / Demand for trucks lifts vehicle sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Registrations of new commercial vehicles - an important barometer of
economic activity - rose by 14.9 per cent year-on-year in May as the
recovery accelerated in the sector.
According to new figures, sales are being driven by rising demand for
trucks, particularly from the construction sector, where registrations
jumped by 33.4 per cent year-on-year in May to 3,426.
Registrations of three and four-axle rigid trucks, which are chiefly used by
the building industry, jumped by 81 per cent year-on-year in May, reflecting
the recent sharp rise in construction orders.
In the first five months of 1994, truck registrations in this sector were 59
per cent higher than a year ago, and some truckmakers are struggling to cope
with the rapid rise in demand.
Overall, sales of new commercial vehicles increased last month to 17,598
from 15,311 in the same month a year ago, according to the figures from the
Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders.
Sales in the first five months of the year rose by 12.9 per cent to 93,083,
from 82,482 a year ago. In the first five months of the year truck sales
rose by 23 per cent on the same period last year, to 16,103.
The upturn in truck demand last year was led by rising sales of articulated
trucks, as long-distance hauliers began to renew their fleets, but the
recovery is now spreading rapidly to urban distribution and construction.
Registrations of light trucks (7.5 tonnes gross vehicle weight), which are
chiefly used in urban distribution, have risen by 26 per cent in the first
five months of the year and jumped by 40 per cent year-on-year in May.
Overall sales of heavy trucks (above 15 tonnes gross vehicle weight) rose by
30 per cent in the first five months of the year to 9,294 and by 36 per cent
year-on-year in May.
Truck sales in the UK more than halved during the recession from 69,234 in
1989 to only 31,398 in 1992. Sales last year were 36,358.
Activity in the van sector, where the recovery has lagged trucks, is also
rising, albeit at a slower rate, as small-business confidence grows.
Registrations of medium-duty vans, which are dominated by the Ford Transit,
increased by 10.4 per cent in May and 11.1 per cent in the first five
months.
Imported vehicles are gaining a growing share of the recovering market, with
42 per cent of the overall commercial vehicle market in May compared with 38
per cent a year ago.

FT  09 JUN 94 / Broadcast law overhaul urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Louis Sherwood, chairman of HTV, the ITV company for Wales and the west
country, will tell shareholders tomorrow that there is an urgent need for a
new broadcasting act.
Mr Sherwood intends to use the platform of the company's annual general
meeting to warn that there are so many unresolved problems arising from the
1990 Broadcasting Act that only comprehensive legislation will do.
The HTV chairman believes the issues range from the Channel 4 campaign to
rid itself of the 'safety net', which will probably mean a Pounds 50m
payment to ITV this year, to ownership rules for ITV, and whether British
Telecommunications should have the freedom to be a broadcaster.
Other problems include future ownership of Independent Television News; the
extent to which the regulator, the Independent Television Commission, can
dictate programme schedules; and whether existing programme subsidies for
the smallest ITV companies should continue.
HTV last year opposed the change in the takeover rules that enabled Carlton
to take over Central; Granada to take over London Weekend; and MAI, the
company that controls Meridian, to swallow Anglia Television. HTV believes
little has been achieved as a result, although the deals cost Pounds 50m in
banking and legal fees - worth 100 hours of drama.
Mr Sherwood is expected to denounce what he believes are two myths that have
gained growing support. They are that ITV needs to have big companies to
export programmes around the world, and that television should be treated
like any other sector in competition terms.
The HTV chairman will tell shareholders he knows of no country in the
developed world that does not have special rules for television.
There is a growing feeling in government that a new broadcasting act is
becoming more necessary.
The eventual form will probably depend on what decisions are taken on the
future of the BBC and cross-media ownership rules.

FT  09 JUN 94 / Housing reforms to go ahead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is to press ahead with changes in housing policy designed to
prevent 'queue-jumping' by homeless lone parents.
This emerged last night after the Earl of Arran, junior environment
minister, accused pressure groups of mounting 'a misleading and alarmist
campaign' against the government's proposals.
Pregnant teenagers, single parents and other vulnerable categories will no
longer be guaranteed speedy access to the permanent tenancy of a house or
flat.
Instead they will be offered temporary accommodation, with guaranteed tenure
of at least six months, while their housing needs are assessed along with
those of other families already on waiting lists.
Lord Arran assured the lords that a 'safety net' would be kept in place for
all those who are classified as statutorily homeless. He said the government
would make a statement next month outlining its response to the
representations made about the new policy.
Legislation to implement it is expected to be introduced in the new
parliamentary session due to open in November.
Baroness Hollis of Heigham, speaking from the Labour front bench, said the
action taken by the government to force up the rents charged by local
authorities and housing associations had contributed to the increase in
homelessness.
She called for the receipts from the sale of council houses to be made
available to provide affordable accommodation for the homeless.

FT  09 JUN 94 / P&amp;O to withdraw Chinese workers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
P&amp;O European Ferries bowed to pressure from French seafaring unions
yesterday and agreed to withdraw 58 Chinese cleaners from its two most
recently chartered ferries.
The French unions disrupted dockings at Cherbourg last week and spread the
action yesterday to Calais, although P&amp;O had already said it would dispense
with the Chinese workers.
The government yesterday asked the French government to intervene in the
dispute after French workers blocked the departure of a P&amp;O ferry from
Calais, disrupting sailings for several hours.
The dispute arose when the French seafarers complained that employment of
the Chinese could drive down pay for other nationalities. However, P&amp;O
suggested yesterday that the action had been a smokescreen for wider fears
about French ferry jobs.
The two ships in which the Chinese were employed were previously run by the
German Olau line.

FT  09 JUN 94 / Membership of unions down 5.6%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Union membership in Britain has fallen to its lowest level since 1946 with
only 31 per cent of employed workers belonging to a union.
Figures issued yesterday by the Department of Employment show that total
membership declined 5.6 per cent by the end of 1992 to 9m.
Since the Tory election victory in 1979, the number of workers in unions had
dropped by 4.2m. It is estimated that 35 per cent of the total labour force
was unionised by the autumn of last year.
Thirty-eight per cent of men are in unions compared with 31 per cent of
women. While 63 per cent of public-sector workers are in unions, the figure
is only 23 per cent in the private sector.
There has been a steep drop in unionisation in the water industry since
privatisation. Since spring 1989 membership has dropped 22 per cent, mainly
because of a sharp drop in white-collar unionisation.
The Department of Employment also released final labour dispute figures for
1993. Some 600,000 working days were lost, nearly half of which were in the
public services.
This is the second-lowest total since records began in 1891. There were 211
separate stoppages.

FT  09 JUN 94 / Politicians quarrel over jobs ruling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government and the Labour party were yesterday locked in a furious
dispute over the European Court of Justice's privatisation ruling, with each
side blaming the other for implementing defective legislation on workers'
rights.
On the eve of the European elections, ministers were anxious to limit any
political damage from the ruling, fearing that it had struck a blow against
the Conservatives' long-standing support for compulsory competitive
tendering of public services.
Labour, however, used the European Court decision to illustrate that it is
far more comfortable than the government with the kind of employment
protection contained in the social chapter of the Maastricht treaty.
At the heart of the dispute was the question of which government had
implemented the legislation on which the European Court based its judgment.
Mr Jack Straw, Labour's environment spokesman, claimed that the legislation
had been introduced by the Conservative government in 1981, but had created
problems because it failed to allow for proper consultation of public-sector
workers whose jobs were contracted out to private companies.
He said: 'A law that British Tories signed up to 13 years ago is now going
to be enforced to give British workers the same rights as are enjoyed by
workers across Europe. The Conservatives signed up to this law and can't now
back away from the consequences.'
He claimed that Labour had been fighting for full implementation of the
acquired rights directive 'to ensure that where people have their employer
transferred over their heads, the rights they had under the previous
employer are carried on'.
However, Mr John Major immediately hit back, claiming that legislation on
the issue had initially been approved by the last Labour government.
At the Tories' Euro-election press conference, the prime minister said:
'This was a European directive approved by the previous Labour government in
1975 and legislated for by them. What they said shows they don't realise
that.'
Mr Charles Kennedy, president of the Liberal Democrats, saw the ruling as an
opportunity to attack the prime minister's recent espousal of a
'multi-track, multi-speed' Europe.
'You cannot get away with picking the laws you like and ignoring the laws
you don't like,' said Mr Kennedy. 'This is what a multi-speed Europe is
really like - a recipe for illegality, disorder and confusion.'

FT  09 JUN 94 / TUC welcomes 'devastating blow'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR and ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British unions were delighted at yesterday's ruling by the European Court of
Justice. 'This is a devastating blow for the British government,' said Mr
John Monks, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress.
'The right of workers to be consulted over redundancies and transfer of
undertakings is a key element of European social policy - one on which the
government are now obliged to legislate.'
Mr Jack Dromey, national officer for the TGWU general union, described the
verdict as 'a landmark decision'.
He added: 'The days of buying and selling workers without their voice being
heard are over. British workers will now enjoy the same protection as
workers in the rest of Europe. The government will have to pay out millions
to tens of thousands of workers.'
But Mr David Hunt, employment secretary, said last night no new employment
compensation cases would arise from the ruling and said that claims from
Opposition spokesmen and union leaders that many 'so-called illegally
sacked' workers would have be eligible were 'outrageous'.
He said the only new element that arose was over consultation - that in
future cases of privatisation employers would be compelled to consult all
their employees, not only recognised unions.
Mr Dromey claimed that the British government would now 'have to legislate
to enshrine for the first time in British law the human rights to
consultation and trade union recognition'. He claimed that 'any attempt by
an employer to derecognise a union will be challenged by our union.'
Lawyers said yesterday that thousands of public-sector workers who lost
their jobs or faced worse employment conditions following privatisation or
the contracting-out of public services could now sue the government for
compensation.
They said workers who could show they suffered loss from the government's
failure to implement important areas of the European acquired rights
directive would be entitled to sue for compensation on the basis of a
European Court decision in 1991 involving Italian workers.
In this instance, called the Francovich case, the court ruled that
individuals had a right to damages where they suffered loss through a
state's failure to implement European Union law.
The TUC has asked the labour academic Lord Wedderburn to present a
considered legal judgment, which will be published shortly.
Five unions - the TGWU, the Unison public service union, the GMB general
union, NUCPS civil service union and the NIPSA Northern Ireland civil
service union - have issued 128 writs against the government covering more
than a thousand public-sector workers in local government, the National
Health Service and government employment, claiming retrospective
compensation for loss of earnings when their jobs were moved into the
private sector.
The TUC hopes to negotiate a settlement with the government over
compensation for as many as 60,000 workers affected rather than pursue
individual cases through the courts, which would be expensive and
time-consuming.
Mr Dromey said the unions had no dispute with contractors and other
employers involved in transfers of employment to the private sector.

FT  09 JUN 94 / Euro-cavalry comes to workers' rescue: The judgments on
employees' rights could give legal clout to staff associations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's two judgments from the European Court of Justice - on the right
of workers to be consulted about redundancies and business transfers - go to
the heart of the UK debate about European labour law.
Employer bodies such as the Institute of Directors say a decision on whether
to consult workers is a typical example of the kind of measure that should
be decided at national, not European, level.
They add that such European labour law hits British employers much harder
than employers in other countries, because the laws tend to reflect the
continental European system of labour relations and not the more
laissez-faire British one.
Trade unionists, and other supporters of the European social dimension, say
that consulting workers is merely civilised practice and one which is backed
by law in every European Union country apart from Britain. Allowing bad
employers not to consult employees encourages a downward spiral of
standards.
But what will yesterday's judgments on consultation actually require from
the government and from companies? What it will not do is give unions a
statutory right to recognition, or introduce 'works councils' into every
British workplace.
In the 1975 Collective Redundancies directive and the 1977 Acquired Rights
directives there is a requirement to inform and consult employee
representatives.
When those directives were transposed into British law the requirement was
restricted to companies which recognise unions. That will no longer be
sufficient.
The government, which was yesterday playing down the changes as a
'technicality', will probably merely introduce legislation requiring
employers to consult employees, leaving the details of how to do so to
employers themselves.
As a result of the decline in union membership and collective bargaining,
the employers which do have union representatives to consult in transfers or
redundancies - or in the similarly organised health and safety committees -
are probably now in a minority.
But that does not mean that other employers have no mechanism for
consultation.
Organisations such as the Confederation of British Industry and the
Institute of Personnel Management have long recommended institutionalised
consultation where unions do not exist. Many companies have staff
associations, or other systems such as team briefings, which could become
the focus of consultation.
A senior manager of one large non-union service sector company said: 'We are
not particularly concerned about these judgments because we already have a
whole range of systems for informing and consulting with people.'
The debate now will focus on the minimum that an employer can get away with.
Will a discussion procedure with the employees affected suffice, or will a
committee have to be established, albeit one which could be dissolved as
soon as the consultation has taken place? If such a committee is required,
will employees have to be elected independently or could the employer simply
select them?
According to Mr Fraser Younson of the Employment Lawyers' Association, the
requirement in European law to 'consult with a view to reaching agreement'
means that it will not be sufficient to inform employees individually and
give them an opportunity to respond. And if a committee mechanism is
established for consultation then it may well take on a life of its own.
Mr Younson also speculated that the requirement to inform and consult might
extend into health-and-safety areas, such as the recent maternity directive
or working time directive. 'This could have huge implications for virtually
all workplaces,' he said.
At the other end of the spectrum, Ms Cherry Mill of the Institute of
Personnel Managers speculated that it might be sufficient for line managers
to give small groups of workers the news through team briefing-type systems
or even through electronic mail.
'You have to go back and look at the intention of the directives. They were
not designed to establish new industrial relations systems but rather to
prepare workers for forthcoming events and give them an opportunity to have
a say; something that is the practice already in most good companies,' said
Ms Mill.
If the amendments do turn out to have a lasting impact on consultation
systems it will not necessarily be to the benefit of British unions. It
could rather help to nudge the UK closer towards the European model, based
in most countries on statutory employee rights, not union rights.
That will be little compensation to employers who see such changes as
introducing unnecessary bureaucracy. But the biggest beneficiaries in the
long run may be the Cinderellas of employee consultation - the non-union
staff associations.

FT  09 JUN 94 / Unsettled outlook for voting forecasts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUTLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK votes cast today in the European elections will not be counted until
Sunday night, although the five Commons by-election results may give some
indication for those who stay up late.
The auguries are bad for the Conservatives, in spite of some hyped
suggestions of a late upsurge, but firm forecasts are difficult for four
main reasons.
Redistribution: Britain has six extra Euro-seats and the boundaries of
almost every English and Welsh constituency has changed, complicating
comparisons.
Turnout: in the 1989 Euro-elections just 35 per cent voted compared to 78
per cent in the 1992 general election. This time the turnout may rise to 40
per cent but the parties and polls disagree on the percentage and on who
will stay at home. If Conservatives are as disillusioned as some
commentators suggest, this could make an enormous difference.
Tactical voting: will Labour voters in the southern seats, where the Liberal
Democrats are the main challengers, recognise how best to oust their Tory
MEP or will they treasure the right to express true party loyalty, even if
it lets the Tories in? Have the Liberal Democrats educated the electorate on
tactical voting as they have done so spectacularly in by-elections?
Regional voting: the campaign saw the Conservative vote collapse to an
all-time low, with Gallup putting Labour 30 points ahead - although ICM cut
that to 18 points yesterday. A MORI poll today gives Labour 51 per cent and
the Tories 23 per cent. But the movement has been uneven with the
Conservatives suffering most in their southern strongholds.
It is possible to calculate what would have happened in the new
constituencies by comparison with the 1989 Euro-election figures, the 1992
general election results or the local election figures from last month. Each
can be misleading as a guide to the movement revealed by today's vote - but
probably the 1992 figures are best.
Constituency factors will undoubtedly produce local variations. There are 15
constituencies where the notional lead is under 4 per cent, so that anyone
wanting to place bets faces a difficult challenge.

FT  09 JUN 94 / C &amp; G takeover in 'virgin territory'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The making of cash payments by Lloyds Bank to all members of the Cheltenham
&amp; Gloucester Building Society, regardless of the length of their membership,
would be illegal, a senior High Court judge ruled yesterday.
Giving judgment Sir Donald Nicholls, the vice-chancellor, ruled against the
proposals for the takeover of the C&amp;G that involved making cash payments to
all members of the building society including those who had been members for
less than two years.
However, he ruled in favour of C&amp;G on two other points: the proposed
payments to holders of deposit accounts and other non-members including
employees; and the ability of C&amp;G directors to vote on the proposed transfer
agreement even though they are shareholding members.
Sir Donald said the disagreements between C&amp;G and the Building Societies
Commission raised questions of fundamental importance about the meaning of
the statutory provisions of the Building Societies Act 1986. 'This is virgin
territory because no building society has yet transferred its business to an
already existing institution.'
Parliament had been concerned that the transfer procedures under the act
which enable takeovers of building societies should not be operated for the
wrong reasons. 'The procedures were intended to facilitate natural organic
development. They were not intended to provide a means whereby an outside
institution might take over a building society business by tempting members
with the offer of a substantial cash bonus.
'There was an obvious risk that members might snap up such an offer
regardless of the best long-term interest of their society.'
The act contained safeguards against this perceived mischief, including the
provision which prevented the distribution of funds by the successor company
to members of less than two years' standing.
'If the proposed transfer agreement had been simply an agreement between C&amp;G
and the proposed successor, with the cash payments coming from the proposed
successor, the agreement would clearly have been unlawful,' he said.
However, the transfer agreement proposed in this case was different, he
said. The cash payments would come not from the proposed successor company
itself, Chambers &amp; Remington, a wholly owned subsidiary of Lloyds Bank,
intended to be renamed Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester plc. Instead, the money would
come from the successor company's parent - Lloyds Bank.
Sir Donald told the court: 'Does this make any difference? It would be
surprising if it did.' It would 'emasculate' section 100(9) of the act, he
said.
He went on: 'All an existing institution would have to do would be to
undertake a simple capital reconstruction and pass assets up to a newly
created parent. Then the parent company could do what the existing
institution cannot. The parent company could use its newly acquired assets
for the purpose of the takeover.
'The parent company could offer a cash bonus to all members of the building
society which its subsidiary is seeking to take over. The cash bonus could
be offered to newly joined members as well as two-year members.'
The C&amp;G had argued that, if this was a loophole, it was one that parliament
had made no provision for, he said.
However, rejecting the C&amp;G argument, Sir Donald said section 100(9) of the
act was plainly directed at restricting the cash payments a successor
company may make to members of the society. Section 100(1) of the act had to
be treated as a 'compendious and exhaustive' statement of the provision for
the payment of cash.
'Otherwise, although the successor is prohibited from applying its funds to
newly joined members in contravention of section 100(9), other companies in
the group of which a successor company is part may be able to do so.
Parliament cannot have intended that to be the position,' he said.
On the second issue, Sir Donald said it would be lawful for payments to be
made to non-members.
'They have no votes. They have no say in whether the transfer agreement will
be approved. In principle, therefore, if the members are prepared to approve
terms whereby part of the cash on offer will be paid to employees and
pensioners and depositors, that is a matter for them,' he said.
The third issue concerned whether the C&amp;G directors should be disqualified
from entering into the transfer agreement because, under the C&amp;G rules, they
had a personal interest in the transfer.
Sir Donald said: 'The proposed transfer is conditional on the passing of the
requisite transfer resolutions by the members. The interest which the
directors have under the agreement can never materialise unless the
agreement is approved by the requisite shareholders' resolutions.'

Pizza Hut, the restaurant and fast-food chain, said yesterday it intended to
open more than 40 restaurants and 60 delivery units throughout the country
over the next two years - a 20 per cent increase - creating up to 2,000
jobs.
It is seeking town-centre sites, free-standing units in out-of-town retail
parks and delivery units in high streets and other locations.
The number of pizza restaurants is rising by about 12 per cent a year with

FT  09 JUN 94 / Hauliers warn on Channel tunnel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS and CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Eurotunnel risks a crisis of confidence among customers if it has further
problems with its freight shuttle service through the Channel tunnel, the
Road Haulage Association warned yesterday, Jimmy Burns and Charles Batchelor
write.
The warning came after the temporary suspension of a train service yesterday
because of technical problems - the second such incidence in 11 days.
Mr Sydney Balgarnie of the association said: 'If they haven't got this
problem cracked soon, there is going to be trouble. People do not want to
get stranded in the tunnel. People want reliability and if they don't get it
they will use the ferries instead.'
Eurotunnel said the two incidents were unrelated although both involved
warning lights that signalled non-existent faults. In one the warning
indicated that the ramps used by trucks driving on to the shuttles were
extended, while in the second a light warned that a train's anti-skid
mechanism was not working.
In yesterday's incident drivers of lorries travelling on the shuttles were
evacuated from the tunnel.
Mr John Noulton, Eurotunnel's public-affairs director, said: 'These were
irritations. It is what you would expect at this stage of introducing a new
railway. The trains could have continued normally but at this stage of the
system our procedures are very strict and we followed them to the letter.'
Eurotunnel has been operating for just over two weeks and has run about 200
trains through the tunnel.

FT  09 JUN 94 / Political Notebook: Now electioneering is over it's back to
serious politics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Serious politics starts again on Monday. The die is now cast in the
elections for the European parliament and the five vacant Westminster
constituencies.
The Conservatives will do very badly, but they hope not catastrophically.
Labour will get on with the business of choosing (almost certainly) Mr Tony
Blair as its leader. The Liberal Democrats will ponder again their role as a
successful, but still sidelined, third party.
Mr John Major has probably had as good a campaign as he could have hoped
for. The tone of his pronouncements on Britain's place in Europe has not
endeared him to enthusiasts on the centre-left of the party. But after a
mid-campaign lurch into the arms of the Euro-sceptics he has moderated his
rhetoric.
By yesterday, the multi-speed Europe first conjured up by Mr Douglas Hurd
was not, after all, an excuse to opt out of everything European. Mr Major,
who avoided closing any options at the 1996 intergovernmental conference,
was once again preaching Eurorealism rather than Europhobia.
The lifting of the immediate threat to his leadership after the death of
John Smith has left the prime minister looking less beleaguered, more
relaxed. His decision some weeks ago - before the death of the Labour leader
 -to fight any challenge seems to have lifted a burden. He mapped out his
campaign role independently of Conservative Central Office, a sign perhaps
that he is determined to be more his own man.
But Mr Major is not secure. Even if the last-minute optimism proves
justified, defeat at Eastleigh and the loss of perhaps half of his party's
European seats will deepen still further Mr Kenneth Clarke's infamous hole.
The economic recovery is well under way. The government is getting no thanks
for it.
The rightwing sceptics who now embrace the prime minister do so only in the
hope of manipulating him. He has to win back the affection of the
centre-left and discover the constancy which his administration has lacked.
He has until the autumn to make a convincing start.
The cabinet reshuffle will be critical. The prime minister wants if possible
to wait until the start of the summer recess in the third week of July. But
he has been thinking hard on the changes. It is the overall impression they
leave that will count. Mr Major has to demonstrate both a sense of authority
and of direction. The reshuffle must not be timid.
He must then shape next year's legislative programme. Some controversial
bills are unavoidable. But if Mr Major is wise he will reject the advice of
cabinet colleagues advocating another burst of Thatcherite radicalism. This
government needs to spend more time thinking things through.
Labour's agenda for the next six weeks is clear. It must have a mature
contest. There will be heated debate about the direction of its economic and
social policies between Mr Blair's modernism and the traditionalism of Mr
John Prescott and, perhaps, Mrs Margaret Beckett.
The union barons will want their say. Full employment is a slogan which
quickens the pulses of party activists. A commitment to a minimum wage is
not the heinous crime some imagine, but it could become a symbol of Labour's
inability to escape the past.
Mr Blair is tougher than allowed for by unkind Bambi epithets. There is a
streak of Mr Neil Kinnock's ruthlessness in the vision of a modern Labour
party. But the campaign will set the parameters in which he will have to
work over the next two years. They will be tighter than he would like.
Mr Paddy Ashdown's Liberal Democrats can look forward to a few days in the
sunshine. A victory at Eastleigh and the expected election of its first MEPs
will follow large gains in the local elections. After some early slip-ups Mr
Ashdown has had a good campaign.
But the spotlight will switch quickly to the Labour leadership - and to the
threat posed by Mr Blair to the Liberal Democrat hold on disenchanted voters
in southern England. The defection yesterday of the Liberal Democrat
candidate in Newham underlined the risk.
The Liberal Democrat party is an essentially local one with representation
at a national level. Mr Ashdown dislikes the House of Commons. But unless he
and his colleagues make a bigger impact at Westminster there is no prospect
of the general election breakthrough that has always eluded them.
No-one is thinking in terms of a pre-election pact with Labour. But the
Liberal Democrats must think hard about whether they can avoid any longer an
implicit alliance to deprive the Conservatives of a fifth term.
So with the resumption of serious politics there are real decisions to be
made. The European elections will paint the backdrop for the second half of
this parliament but the politicians still have a chance to rewrite the
script.

FT  09 JUN 94 / Lib Dem candidate rocks party by moving to Labour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Liberal Democrats were last night rocked by an eve-of-polling day
bombshell when their candidate in the Newham North East by-election
announced he was defecting to Labour. The decision by Mr Alec Kellaway, a
41-year-old Newham councillor, provided an extraordinary finale to 16 days
of frenetic campaigning in the run-up to today's European elections and five
parliamentary by-elections.
The move provided an unexpected windfall for the increasingly buoyant
Tories.
Sir Norman Fowler, the Conservative chairman, said Mr Kellaway's decision
proved the jump from Liberal Democrat to Labour was 'a very short step'. He
urged voters to ask themselves whether their Liberal Democrat candidate was
'yet another Labour politician in disguise'.
As the three main party leaders delivered their final campaign messages, Mr
John Major talked up Britain's economic prospects and said the opposition's
policies were 'out of tune with the electorate'.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, said the Labour and Liberal Democrat
approach to Europe was deeply old-fashioned and stuck in a failed economic
philosophy of subsidy and regulations.
Meanwhile Mr Peter Lilley, the Euro-sceptic social security secretary, put
in a belated appearance on the campaign trail. He told Huddersfield Tories
that voters faced a choice between 'Conservative jobs or socialist
unemployment'.
For Labour, Mrs Margaret Beckett, party leader, said the European elections
were a referendum on a government that had failed Britain. Mr Jack
Cunningham, shadow foreign secretary, predicted Labour would make the most
gains.
Mr Paddy Ashdown - ending his campaign in Eastleigh, the Hampshire
parliamentary constituency the Liberal Democrats expect to capture from the
Tories - urged voters to 'send the first Liberal Democrats to the European
parliament'.
He said Labour was out of the race in the south of England and added: 'If
you vote for Labour you risk throwing a lifeline to the government.'
Although Mr Kellaway said he had made yesterday's switch because there was
'virtually no division' on policy between Labour and the Liberal Democrats,
both parties were at pains to emphasise that his decision was primarily of
local relevance.
Mr Kellaway, a former Labour party member and self-proclaimed 'Christian
socialist', said the fact that Mr Tony Blair was 'about to become' Labour
leader was instrumental in his decision. He said the shadow home secretary
'seems to now represent the mainstream' of the party.
He denied his move was a stunt. It was 'a coming home rather than a
conversion'. He had virtually never voted against the Labour whip on Newham
council.
Mr Simon Hughes, the Liberal Democrat MP for Southwark and Bermondsey, said
his party was puzzled and saddened by Mr Kellaway's 'bizarre and unexpected
behaviour'.
He was sorry people in Newham North East would no longer be able to vote for
a Liberal Democrat candidate.
Newham North East, a safe Labour seat, is the former constituency of Mr Reg
Prentice, the ex-minister who resigned from the Labour party and joined the
Conservatives nearly 20 years ago.

FT  09 JUN 94 / SNP hopes strengthened by polls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Scottish National party enters today's Euro-elections with its hopes of
winning a second Euro-seat and of strengthening its position in others,
boosted by favourable opinion poll findings.
An ICM opinion poll for The Scotsman newspaper and Scottish Television put
support for the SNP at 31 per cent, one of its highest levels. It also
showed that 48 per cent believed Scotland would get a better deal from the
European Union if it were independent.
The SNP is increasingly confident of winning the North-east Scotland seat -
which includes Aberden and Dundee - from Labour, which beat it in 1989 by
only 2,613 votes. The SNP already holds Highlands and Islands, where Mrs
Winnie Ewing took 51.5 per cent of the vote in 1989.
The party hopes at least to strengthen its position in the six other
Scottish seats, which are held by Labour. Last time it came second in four
of them.
The ICM poll showed Labour on 46 per cent, the Liberal Democrats on 11 per
cent and the Conservatives in fourth place on 10 per cent, their lowest
level ever.
Labour is concerned that the leeching of support from the Tories to the
nationalists in rural areas, where Labour is not the Tories' main opponent,
could work to its disadvantage. But while the SNP claims to have won the
argument in the campaign, it agrees that the outcome depends on the level of
turnout. 'The turnout is very difficult to predict,' Mr John Swinney, the
SNP's campaign director said yesterday.
The ICM poll showed a three point drop to 35 per cent in those backing
independence for Scotland, with 46 per cent wanting a separate Scottish
parliament under Westminster. It also showed most Scots believe that the
European Commission and European parliament should have less importance than
national parliaments, and that European integration should be slowed down.

The Irish government has confirmed that it has recently been in

The move follows the British government's clarifications given to Sinn Fein,
the political wing of the IRA, last month.
Mr Albert Reynolds the Irish prime minister, said that Loyalist paramilitary
groups had this week 'sought clarification from me which is a very welcome
development'.
He was willing to extend such clarification 'as I have extended to others'
but emphasised that he would not enter into negotiations on the Downing

FT  09 JUN 94 / Pension providers face cost increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The trustees of the Mine-workers Pension Scheme have recommended that half
of the scheme's Pounds 800m surplus be used to improve benefits for
pensioners and members.
The improvement is likely to increase the costs facing private pension
providers in compensating former scheme members who were persuaded wrongly
to transfer to personal pensions.
The pension transfers are the subject of a regulatory review, and insurance
companies are likely to be ordered to pay compensation to 'buy' members of
the miners' scheme back into it.
The benefit improvements will increase payments to about 450,000 current and
deferred pensioners by 6.5 per cent. Deferred pensioners are those who have
left the scheme, but are below pensionable age.
Current contributing scheme members will be entitled to one additional
years' service credit for each 15 years of membership, which will be
equivalent to a 6.5 per cent increase in benefits.
The trustees of the scheme make recommendations on the use of scheme
surpluses, but the decision is ultimately at the discretion of British Coal.
The decision to distribute some of the surplus follows the latest pension
scheme valuation last September. The rest of the surplus will be used to
continue British Coal's contributions holiday until the date of
privatisation.
The balance will be invested in a reserve account, in accordance with an
agreement between the government and British Coal designed to protect the
benefits of scheme members.
The two previous scheme surpluses have also been used to enhance members'
benefits and to offer a contributions holiday to British Coal.

FT  09 JUN 94 / C&amp;G studies ways to beat takeover ban
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Closing Cheltenham and Gloucester Building Society to new members was one of
the boldest moves suggested yesterday by which the society could get round
the High Court judgment against the takeover by Lloyds Bank.
Once the society had closed, it would simply have to wait until all its
members had acquired at least two years' standing. But, although that would
be a theoretically elegant conclusion, it would be likely to disrupt the
original takeover timetable. Halting the growth of the society would also
make it less attractive to Lloyds.
The court ruling may well make it hardest for banks to take over the most
attractive societies because those that are growing fastest will have the
highest proportions of new members to whom payments are not allowed to be
made.
C&amp;G is one of the fastest-growing of all societies - as indicated by the
fact that 27 per cent of its members are of less than two years' standing. A
society with only a small proportion of new members is likely to be moribund
and small.
A possibility canvassed as an alternative to a cash bid was that Lloyds
could make payments of preference shares as an alternative to cash. However,
any easy exchange of such shares for cash could make such a scheme illegal.
The society may consider other alternatives to closing itself to new
members:
Giving members' of less than two years' standing some value for the
surrender of their voting rights. Provided that there was no vote against
the takeover from these investors, Lloyds' bid could well pass the the
voting thresholds.
This possibility is raised by Sir Donald Nicholls' ruling that a third party
can make payments to non-voting members of a society. Lloyds might be able
to make payments to people who chose to become non-members using this
provision.
Dividing the Pounds 1.8m among those of two years' standing. Mr Andrew
Longhurst, C&amp;G chief executive, who has been keen to show the widespread
benefits of the Lloyds' offer, discounted this possibility last night.
However, it could be used if no alternative was found.
Because only a 50 per cent majority of those eligible to vote is required,
the society could well gain such a majority from the 73 per cent whom it was
paying. The problem would be if members of under two years' standing voted
against.

FT  09 JUN 94 / Rail sell-off plans hit by resignation of rolling-stock
chief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's rail privatisation plans face further delay after the
decision by the managing director of one of the three rolling-stock leasing
companies to step down.
BR confirmed yesterday that Mr Tony Roche, whose appointment as managing
director of the Eversholt Train Leasing Company was announced on April 21,
has left after just over a month for a more senior position at British Rail.
When he was appointed Mr Roche was described as having played a key role in
the creation of the companies that have been set up to lease locomotives,
carriages and wagons to the train-operating companies.
The managing directors of the two other rolling-stock companies have come
from the leasing sector. Mr Brian Hassell is to take up his appointment this
month while Mr Sandy Anderson will start in July.
Two of the rolling-stock companies are based in London and the other is
based in Sheffield - the government has allocated to each a mixture of BR
rolling stock.
The leasing industry expects the government to put the companies up for sale
next year, though this imposes a very tight timetable on the programme.
One leasing specialist said that if the government insisted on buyers
bidding on the basis of the current replacement value of the companies'
assets it may have problems finding buyers. Replacement value could be as
much as three times the book value of the assets, put at about Pounds 1.6bn.
The first few weeks since the break-up of British Rail have brought higher
ticket-prices, cuts in services and a reduction in the amount of information
available to travellers, Labour said yesterday.
Mr Frank Dobson, shadow transport secretary, said a round-up of complaints
by passengers to regional rail users' consultative committees revealed that
companies were pricing some lines out of existence, reducing passengers'
choice of journey routes and ceasing to recognise each others' tickets.
BR said there had been some 'anomalies' following the introduction of the
new timetables last month, but that these had been put right.

FT  09 JUN 94 / Top bankers by royal appointment: How the Queen helped
monetary conference delegates 'walk on air'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Nice one, knight,' said the chief executive of an American bank to Sir
Dennis Weatherstone, the British chairman of the US bank JP Morgan. Sir
Dennis was walking down the aisle of a coach full of bankers as it prepared
to leave Buckingham Palace, where they had met the Queen.
In his speech at the dinner that followed, under the Rubens ceiling of the
Banqueting House in Whitehall, Sir Dennis said the assembled heads of the
largest banks in the world were 'walking on air' after being greeted by the
Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh on Tuesday night.
Few passers-by would have realised that the 300 occupants of the five
coaches which had swept down The Mall from the palace were soinfluential.
The annual meeting of the International Monetary Conference was on another
leg of a discreet journey round the world's financial centres.
Last year Stockholm, this year London, next year Seattle. The heads of 103
of the world's largest banks use their annual meetings as an opportunity to
discuss their industry and to hobnob in private discussions and at dinners.
As they control several trillion dollars in assets between them, they are
also used to being treated royally. In Madrid in 1989, they were received by
the King and Queen of Spain. The reception at Buckingham Palace was
generally held to have topped that.
The conference is a meeting for bankers' spouses, too. In practice this
means wives, since the heads of the member banks are all male. The partners
have a chance to gain some excitement from their marital link to what many
privately say is a boring industry.
Thus, on Tuesday evening, the chairmen of two European banks were to be
found sipping champagne in a palace stateroom, jocularly comparing notes on
which bank had a higher return on equity. Their wives were standing nearby
discussing the best shops in the world to buy pearls.
In spite of its growing international membership, the conference has an
American feel, owing to its roots as an organisation formed in the early
1950s by American bankers to educate others in the profession about
international finance.
The conference has remained a favourite meeting for senior bankers because
of its small size. It is easier for heads of banks to find and chat to each
other in corridors and at lunches than at the vast annual meetings of the
International Monetary Fund and World Bank.
The last formal session was chaired by Mr Richard Thomas, chairman and chief
executive of First National Bank of Chicago.
Like others, Mr Thomas was in a cheerful mood yesterday in spite of the
fears over the future of banking expressed during the week.
This was because bankers were in a more optimistic frame of mind about their
economies than last year although he did not discount the effect of the
'very special' visit to Buckingham Palace. 'I contrast the tone with a year
ago, when everyone was very down about unemployment in Europe,' he said.
It will not just be Buckingham Palace that may linger in bankers' minds, but
a subtle British effort to persuade them that many UK traditions are worth
keeping. That was reinforced in a song by the King's Singers, composed for
the occasion and sung to the bankers on Tuesday.
'Glory be to the Deutschemark, and to the Yen, but mostly to the holy pound.
As it was in the beginning, before all this talk of a single European
currency, is now and ever shall be, Amen,' sang the group. The German and
French bankers laughed gamely at this harmonised propaganda.

FT  09 JUN 94 / Eurotunnel is warned of customer crisis of confidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS and CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Eurotunnel risks a crisis of confidence among customers if it has further
problems with its freight shuttle service through the Channel tunnel, the
Road Haulage Association warned yesterday.
Mr Sydney Balgarnie, the association's spokesman, said: 'If they haven't got
this problem cracked soon, there is going to be trouble. People do not want
to get stranded in the tunnel. People want reliability, and if they don't
get it they will use the ferries instead.'
His comments came after yesterday's incident involving the temporary
suspension of a train service because of technical problems - the second
such incident in 11 days. Eurotunnel said the two incidents were unrelated
though both involved warning lights that signalled non-existent faults.
In one instance the warning indicated that the ramps used by trucks driving
on to the shuttles were extended, while in the second a light warned that a
train's anti-skid mechanism was not working.
In the second incident, drivers of lorries travelling on the shuttles were
evacuated from the tunnel.
Mr John Noulton, Eurotunnel's public affairs director, said: 'These were
irritations. It is what you would expect at this stage of introducing a new
railway. The trains could have continued normally, but at this stage of the
system our procedures are very strict and we followed them to the letter.'
Eurotunnel has been operating for just over two weeks and has run about 200
trains through the tunnel.
Mr John Chapman, Eurotunnel freight sales manager, said the incidents 'had
no safety implications at all'. No drivers were in danger.
Mr Balgarnie said that any breakdown in the tunnel had a psychological
effect which would intensify once a full service was running.
Last month Eurotunnel launched a highly-discounted promotion service for
selected transport companies with the aim of attracting hauliers who
normally use ferry services.

The total number of transactions in the housing market increased by 25 per
cent in the six months to March compared with the same period in the
previous year, says a report by the Valuation Office, an agency of the
Inland Revenue.
House prices rose by an average of 0.66 per cent over the six months,
according to district valuers.
The performance of different regions ranged from no movement in the
north-west, south-west and west Midlands to a 2 per cent rise in the east
Midlands.
Residential building land values increased sharply in areas such as East
Anglia, where they rose by 15 per cent. The west Midlands, the north of
England, and Wales registered only minimal rises in average values.

FT  09 JUN 94 / P&amp;O to withdraw Chinese workers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
P&amp;O European Ferries bowed to pressure from French seafaring unions
yesterday and agreed to withdraw 58 Chinese cleaners on its two most
recently chartered ferries.
The French unions had disrupted dockings at Cherbourg last week and spread
the action yesterday to Calais, although P&amp;O had already said it would
dispense with the Chinese workers.
The government yesterday asked the French government to intervene in the
dispute after French workers blocked the departure of a P&amp;O ferry from
Calais, disrupting sailings for several hours.
The dispute arose when the French seafarers complained that employment of
the Chinese could drive down pay for other nationals. However, P&amp;O suggested
yesterday that the action had been a smokescreen for wider fears about
French ferry jobs.
The company said it was reluctantly ending the employment of the Chinese on
the two ships, which were previously run by Germany's Olau line.
It added: 'Chinese have served on these two ships for the past four years
while they were operating between the UK and the Netherlands under a German
flag.'
The company said it was examining the legal implications of the action.

The first few weeks since the breakup of British Rail have brought higher
ticket prices, cuts in services and a reduction in the amount of information
available to travellers, Labour said yesterday.
Mr Frank Dobson, shadow transport secretary, said that a round-up of
complaints by passengers to regional rail users' consultative committees
revealed evidence that companies were pricing some lines out of existence,
reducing passengers' choice of journey routes and ceasing to recognise each
others' tickets.
BR said there had been some 'anomalies' following the introduction of the
new timetables last month, but that these had been put right. Some train
operators had published maps which did not show services provided by
competitors but this had been rectified.
Labour also published a copy of a leaked letter from Mr John Welsby, BR
chief executive, to Mr Roger Salmon, the railway franchising director.
It stated that the draft franchise agreement drawn up by Mr Salmon, which
will set the general framework for agreements between Mr Salmon and the
train operators, was unduly rigid and would create problems for operators.
The letter, written in March and confirmed as genuine by BR, claimed that
the draft agreement left little room for commercial innovation. It also
called for greater flexibility for train operators in altering their
timetables. The rail regulator's office said the letter was only a first
draft.

The US Navy moved yesterday to safeguard its shipyards by announcing that it
would split contracts evenly for six Dollars 1bn Aegis destroyers between
two yards without competing bids, Reuter reports from Washington.
Navy Secretary John Dalton called the radical departure from competition for
such contracts 'a smart business strategy. . . to maintain a healthy
industrial base for the surface combatants that will lead the Navy into the
21st century'.
The yards are Ingalls, a unit of Litton Industries in Pascagoula,
Mississippi, and Bath Iron Works which is a private shipyard in Bath, Maine.
Each company has previously built Aegis guided missile destroyers. The
contracts will be awarded this year and next.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton is expected to announce tougher economic sanctions
against Haiti this week as the US moves to implement recommendations from
the Organisation of American States to tighten the noose on the country's
economic elite.
Mr William Gray, the former congressman who has been named Mr Clinton's
special adviser on Haiti, said yesterday he expected the US to ban
commercial flights and freeze financial transactions with Haiti in the next
few days. 'I have confidence sanctions can create an environment where
people come to their senses,' Mr Gray told the House of Representatives
foreign affairs committee yesterday.
Other nations in Latin America and the Caribbean have also promised to
contribute troops for an eventual United Nations mission to provide civil
law enforcement in Haiti if the military coup leaders step down and allow
the return of ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
Mr Gray said the broad embargo imposed by the UN on May 21 was the first
real attempt to apply economic pressure to Haiti, since an earlier ban on
fuel and arms had been narrowly targeted.
The new measures were agreed last week by the four countries - Canada,
France, the US and Venezuela - which have taken the lead in efforts to
restore democracy to Haiti since the military coup in 1991.
Critics have complained that sanctions so far have hurt only the country's
poor, while wealthy businessmen leaders have been able to fly freely to
Miami.

FT  09 JUN 94 / Oxford teaches Clinton the Latin for gridlock
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   OXFORD
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Oxford tried not to let the visit of the US president cut too heavily into
its routine yesterday. True, outside the Sheldonian Theatre, where Mr Bill
Clinton received his degree by diploma, there was enough electronics and
satellite communications equipment to restart the Star Wars programme.
For a modest distance down the street outside there were crowd barriers, and
a number of solid-looking figures with wires sprouting from their ears
mumbling into their hands. And rather more men than is perhaps strictly
conventional in Oxford were standing on roofs and staring into windows
through binoculars.
But for the most part the university seemed to inhale deeply and carried on
manufacturing world leaders.
The speech given by Lord Jenkins, Oxford's Chancellor, was careful to
maintain the university's dignity at the same time as honouring Mr Clinton.
Mr Clinton, dressed in scarlet robes, took some ribbing from Lord Jenkins in
good part and said the university had intimidated him before. Following the
degree ceremony in Latin, he once more felt like 'just another Yank, half a
step behind'.
Oxford's citation-writers had certainly been hard at it, even managing a
Latin translation of the president's 'achievement in resolving the gridlock
which prevented an agreed budget'.
Mr Clinton also shrugged off a student protest outside the theatre.
As the chanting threatened to drown out his speech, he mildly observed that
all forms of debate were clearly still alive in Oxford.
Earlier, after a morning of dour rain, Oxford spared some welcoming sunshine
as Mr Clinton's fleet of Chinook and Sea King helicopters clattered into
Merton Fields just after midday.
A good crowd turned out to see him land, but he was quickly ushered away for
a private walk up Merton Street to the back entrance of University College,
where he studied politics as a Rhodes scholar from October 1968 to June
1970.
While he enjoyed a private lunch in his old college, nervous-looking
undergraduates spilled from the Examination Schools next door at the end of
the morning paper.
This is finals time and some who had finished that lunchtime ended up in the
pub which was reported to be Bill Clinton's favourite - the Turf.
By the time the president had finished eating a few streets away, the
distinctive white-tie-and-black-gown subfusc uniforms of some finalists were
doing passable imitations of lemon meringue pies, covered in flour, eggs,
champagne and crazy foam. Good training for a world leader.

FT  09 JUN 94 / White elephant fails to take flight: Denver's ill-fated new
airport
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Poor Denver. By now, the state capital of Colorado should have been the
proud owner of the first new airport in the US for nearly 20 years. Instead,
repeated delays to the opening have left the city with egg all over its
face. Now critics are asking: Was the whole thing a waste of money?
The Dollars 3.2bn (Pounds 2.1bn) project looks like an exercise in
magnificence. The 1.4m sq ft terminal building has a Teflon-coated fabric
roof shaped into 34 peaks symbolising the nearby Rocky Mountains. Soft,
shadowless light filters down through the roof to illuminate the Great Hall
beneath, a 126ft-high atrium paved with Italian black granite and running
the length of three football fields. The terminal incorporates more than
Dollars 7.5m worth of fountains, sculptures and other works of art.
The only trouble is, there are no passengers in it. The airport was to open
last October, but the company that built the computerised baggage handling
system - BAE Automated Systems, a Dallas subsidiary of BTR, the British
conglomerate - cannot get it to work properly, and the opening has been
postponed indefinitely.
US news media are now compounding the city's embarrassment by asking why the
airport was built at all. Never mind that it is late in opening and cost
nearly twice the original estimate of Dollars 1.7bn, they say: it is a white
elephant, planned at a time when traffic was growing more rapidly and when
US airlines could afford higher landing fees.
For the past 65 years, passengers flying in and out of Denver have used the
handy Stapleton airport just outside the city centre. That airport was due
to close when the new Denver International Airport opened 24 miles to the
north east because the city said it was too small to cope with forecast
traffic growth.
But critics such as Mr Michael Boyd, an aviation consultant in nearby
Golden, Colorado, suggest that Mr Federico Pena, mayor of Denver in the
mid-1980s, drove the scheme through more for political advancement than on
the basis of any sound economic justification. (Mr Pena is now US
transportation secretary.) Traffic forecasts were inflated to justify the
new airport's construction, Mr Boyd suggests. With a bit of adjustment to
the runway configuration, Stapleton could have accommodated the traffic for
years.
City officials concede that traffic declined between 1986 and 1990, but say
it is growing rapidly again. Stapleton is operating close to its maximum
capacity, they say, and there is simply no room for expansion.
Just as important, federal regulations do not allow Stapleton's two main
parallel runways to be used simultaneously in poor visibility because they
are too close together. That reduces the number of flights it can handle
from 90 an hour to 30 in bad weather, making the airport one of the worst in
the US for delays. The new airport, with three parallel runways that can be
used simultaneously whatever the weather, will solve that problem at a
stroke.
Even the project's severest critics tend to agree that Denver would have
needed a new airport eventually. Their main argument is that the one it
decided to build was too much, too soon. If they are right, who will pay the
penalty?
Not the taxpayer, it seems: the airport's construction was funded through
bond issues that carry no government guarantees. Nor do the bondholders seem
likely to lose their money: the extra costs of the project will be recouped
through higher landing fees for the airport's users.
Critics say the local economy will suffer because these higher landing fees
 -about Dollars 15 a passenger compared with Dollars 7-Dollars 8 at
Stapleton - will drive airlines away. These fears were reinforced when
Continental Airlines, one of Denver's two biggest operators, announced
recently that it was axing 24 per cent of its flights in and out of the
city.
Yet Continental says it is pulling back from Denver because it sees better
business opportunities in the east coast market, not because of higher
landing fees; and in any event, the gap is rapidly being filled by United
Airlines, Denver's other big carrier.
Meanwhile a fledgling carrier, Frontier Airlines, is about to adopt the new
airport as its base in spite of the higher fees. Once a big operator at
Denver until it went bankrupt in the 1980s, Frontier said it would not have
been going back into business if the new airport had not been built.
Meanwhile city officials console themselves with the thought that virtually
every new airport is regarded as a white elephant when first built, but
seldom stays that way for long. As to the suggestion that Denver's airport
might have been built more quickly and cheaply if the private sector had
been given the job, they murmur: 'Oh? Like the Channel tunnel?'

FT  09 JUN 94 / Brazil aims to deter price rises: Strict measures planned to
back new currency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAO PAULO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Brazil is preparing tough legal measures to deter companies from raising
prices after the country's new currency is introduced on July 1. The
measures are also partly designed to deflect criticism that the government's
economic stabilisation plan, launched last December to tackle
near-hyperinflation, has benefited business rather than consumers.
A so-called 'anti-trust' law was approved by the lower house of Congress on
Tuesday and is expected to be passed by the Senate next week.
The measures expected to be adopted include:
Heavy fines or even prison sentences for those found guilty of implementing
'unjustified' price increases and 'excessive' prices;
Companies controlling 30 per cent of a market will be defined as dominant
and subject to special scrutiny;
Mergers or alliances between companies controlling more than 30 per cent of
a market will need clearance from a newly empowered watchdog, known as Cade.
The law has been under discussion for a year but its implementation has
become a priority only in recent weeks. The government fears that without
such a law in place it will be powerless to deter companies from raising
prices in the new currency, the real, thereby leading to another
inflationary spiral.
Heavy lobbying from the business community, which feared that the new
controls could be too subjective and open to political abuse, led to some
measures being watered down. Prison terms will now be handed down only if
there is clear evidence of 'crimes against the economic order' and definite
individual responsibility, which is expected to be difficult to prove.
Analysts said the new law was important to deter outright price abuses
especially since, following five years of deregulation, the government has
less control over the economy. But some price rises, especially for
services, will be impossible to prevent. In previous currency switches, the
government has usually imposed some form of temporary price freeze. This
time the government has shunned all such 'magic' measures.
But some observers said the new law, if passed, would be important as a
propaganda weapon to calm the doubts of consumers, who have seen inflation
increase to about 45 per cent a month since plans to introduce the new
currency were announced.
Approval should stem criticism from the populist President Itamar Franco,
who is unhappy about price rises and high interest rates. Any reduction in
interest rates now would be dangerous because of the need for tight monetary
policy following the real's introduction.

FT  09 JUN 94 / Dead or alive, incumbents do well in US primaries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Results from primary elections in eight US states this week suggest that
simmering resentment of Washington insiders is still not enough to reverse
the strong electoral advantages of incumbency and money.
The California governorship - which could play a pivotal role in the 1996
presidential election - will, as expected, be fought between incumbent
Governor Pete Wilson, who won the Republican party nomination, and state
treasurer Kathleen Brown, who won the Democratic primary.
'There's no more important race in the United States, I suspect, for either
of the parties but certainly for the Republican party, than Pete Wilson's
re-election,' Mr Haley Barbour, chairman of the Republican national party,
said yesterday.
In the California senate election, Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein will
face Congressman Michael Huffington, a wealthy Texan who has spent millions
of dollars of his own money on his campaigns.
Members of Congress who had appeared vulnerable because of their financial
or sexual peccadilloes, or their voting records, shrugged off challengers to
win their party's nominations for the November general election.
In southern California, Congressman Jay Kim held on to the Republican
nomination with 41 per cent in a five-way race, despite charges that he
illegally financed his 1992 election campaign through his own business.
Congressman Ken Calvert, another Republican, won his primary with 52 per
cent, although some voters were put off by his explanations of what the
police had found him doing in a parked car with a prostitute.
Like most other members who have been targeted by trade unions because they
voted in favour of the North American Free Trade Agreement, Congressman Mike
Parker of Mississippi also survived a challenge.
In another Mississippi district left vacant for the first time since 1941 by
the retirement of Congressman Jamie Whitten, the two leaders in each party's
primary will enter a run-off election.
The only incumbent ousted yesterday was Republican Governor Walter Dale
Miller of South Dakota. He inherited the office when his predecessor died
and was defeated in Tuesday's Republican primary by former Governor Bill
Janklow.
One incumbent, San Jose city councilman George Shirakawa, even won
re-election by an overwhelming margin, despite being dead for more than a
month.

businessmen who have provided much support for the military coup leaders
have been able to fly freely to Miami to stock up on groceries and other

Mr Gray said that efforts to stop the flow of goods across Haiti's land
border with the Dominican Republic had been 75 to 80 per cent effective, and
that the sanctions were taking a toll on the wealthy, as well as the poor.
'Our intelligence tells us that there are many who are beginning to feel
already, after only three weeks, the bite of the sanctions. This business
elite which has supported the coup leaders will not be able to sit back and
wait six, eight months before they feel the pain,' he said.

FT  09 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Boeing sues Airbus over patents
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Boeing is suing Airbus as well as the British, French and German partners in
the European consortium for alleged patent infringement over a wing slat and
flap actuator mechanism.
It is the first time Boeing, the world's largest maker of commercial
aircraft, has launched a law suit against its European rival, it confirmed
in Seattle yesterday.
The writs have been filed in the UK, Germany and France against Airbus
Industrie, British Aerospace, Deutsche Aerospace and Aerospatiale.
Airbus yesterday vigorously rejected the charges. 'We totally dispute the
Boeing claims and we have instructed our lawyers to fight the action,' a
senior official said in Toulouse. Airbus described the Boeing action as
'completely misconceived' and said it was 'confident as to its outcome'.
Although Boeing declined to give details of its complaint, it confirmed that
the alleged patent infringement involved wing parts for its 757 twin engine
airliner as well as its new 777 wide-body aircraft.
Boeing would not disclose which Airbus aircraft was involved in the
allegation, but it is understood to involve all Airbus airliners dating from
the A320 twin-engine, 150-seater aircraft, the A321 stretched version of the
A320 and the new A330 and A340 family of Airbus wide-body airliners.
British Aerospace has overall design responsibility on the slats and flaps
on these Airbus airliners, for which it manufactures all the wing sets.

FT  09 JUN 94 / World Trade News: BPB plans Berlin plasterboard plant -
Eastern Germany has become Europe's fastest growing construction market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR and JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Plans to build a Pounds 50m plasterboard plant in Berlin were announced
yesterday by BPB Industries of Britain, continuing the heavy investment by
European building material companies in eastern Germany.
The region has become Europe's fastest growing construction market as
authorities seek to satisfy demands for improved living standards in the
east and accommodate the many immigrants who have flocked to west Germany in
the past five years.
Last month Lafarge Coppee of France, Europe's second largest plasterboard
maker, behind BPB Industries, announced the construction of a DM75m (Pounds
30m) plant at Lubbenau, eastern Germany, to serve the local market and
eastern Europe, particularly the Czech republic.
The French company since 1990 has spent approaching FFr2bn (Pounds 233m) to
acquire and modernise eastern Germany's biggest cement works at Karlsdorff,
near Leipzig, supplying about 30 per cent of the region's increasing demand
for cement.
RMC of Britain, the world's biggest concrete producer, expects to have spent
nearly Pounds 500m by 1995 acquiring and modernising cement works, aggregate
quarries and ready-mixed-concrete plants in eastern Germany.
The big rise in German housebuilding shows no sign of slackening. The five
eastern states, in the first three months of this year, issued building
permits for the construction of 23,500 homes, up 121 per cent on the
corresponding period last year.
In western Germany the number of new building permits rose by about a fifth
during the first quarter, to provide some 115,000 homes.
Total permits, including new building, flat conversions and homes in
non-residential buildings, last year rose 14 per cent, to 524,000, in
western Germany and 223 per cent, to 82,600, in eastern Germany.
In Britain, by contrast, work started on 185,500 private and public sector
homes last year, an 18 per cent increase on the previous year's 156,500
housing starts.
Redland, another large British building material group and Europe's biggest
roof tile producer, last year earned more profit in eastern Germany than it
did in the whole of the UK. The company, through its 50.8 per cent-owned
German subsidiary, will by the end of this year operate seven tile plants,
two chimney making works and one brick plant by in eastern Germany.
BPB, announcing its plans for the Berlin works, said Germany buys about 160m
sq metres of plasterboard a year. It expects this to rise to 240m-250m sq
metres within 10 years.
Mr Alan Turner, BPB's chairman, said the Berlin plant would be able to
produce 50m sq metres, making it one of the worlds largest single line
plasterboard factories. It may also supply eastern European countries such
as Poland and the Czech Republic, and is expected to be operational within
two years.
Plasterboard is a prefabricated, light, easy-to-use material, ideal for the
inner walls of homes and for partitioning offices. It is widely used in the
US and Scandinavian countries and has been gaining market share in Britain
and France and to a lesser extent Germany.
The eastern region of the country is likely to continue to lead the growth
in German overall construction demand, with total orders rising by 35.5 per

The federal government last year invested more than DM18.3bn upgrading the

companies invested DM35.3bn in the non-residential property, up 22 per cent.
More than DM33.9bn was invested in private housing, a rise of 42.2 per cent.

Mr Rubens Ricupero, Brazil's finance minister and former Gatt ambassador,
has been officially endorsed by his government as Brazil's candidate to head
the World Trade Organisation, and looks set to win wide Latin American
support.
The decision was notified yesterday to Mr Andras Szepesi, chairman of the
contracting parties of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, who is in
charge of the selection process. The WTO is due to succeed Gatt next year.
The other official candidate so far is Mr Renato Ruggiero, former Italian
trade minister, who is expected to win the formal endorsement of the
European Union, probably at the Corfu summit this month.
Though Gatt's top job has traditionally gone to a European, many developing
country members feel the time has come for one of their own in the WTO slot.
Latin American candidates put up a strong showing against Mr Peter
Sutherland, the present Gatt chief, in last year's contest. Mr Sutherland
has ruled himself out of the WTO race.
Mr Ricupero, 57, is an old trade hand. He was Brazil's Gatt ambassador from
1987 to 1991, when the Uruguay Round trade talks were in full spate, and has
held all the main elective Gatt posts including chairman of its governing
council and of the contracting parties (members).

FT  09 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Mexico-US sugar row looms - A potential
trade dispute with its roots in Nafta
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TED BARDACKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A planned switch by Mexico's Coca-Cola bottlers from domestically produced
refined sugar to imported corn syrup is threatening to set off a trade
dispute between the US and Mexico, the world's largest per capita consumer
of soft drinks.
It all began with last-minute changes to the sugar export provisions of the
North American Free Trade Agreement, which both the US and Mexico argued
were necessary to win ratification of the accord in the US Congress. The
original rules gave Mexico an annual sugar export quota of 250,000 tonnes,
which the US promised to lift automatically if Mexico proved to be a net
sugar exporter for two consecutive years.
This rule was designed to prevent Mexico from importing cheap sugar to
satisfy national demand while exporting domestically produced sugar to the
US market where tariffs keep prices high. Under the revised provisions,
Mexico agreed that imports of corn syrup would be included, thus preventing
soft drink bottlers and other industrial users from switching to imported
corn syrup to free up sugar for export. A third of Mexico's average 4m-tonne
annual sugar production is consumed by industries that could switch to
cheaper corn syrup.
Now, as Coca-Cola bottlers study plans to switch - for a capital outlay of
between Dollars 1m and Dollars 2m per bottling plant they can save several
million dollars a year on raw materials and transportation costs - they and
the US Corn Refiners Association are accusing Mexican trade officials, sugar
producers and Pepsi bottlers of erecting an embargo against corn syrup.
The CRA has alleged that the Mexican sugar industry with the support of Dr
Jaime Serra Puche, Mexico's minister of trade, has put pressure on Mexican
bottlers not to use high-fructose corn syrup. It also alleges that bottlers
have been threatened with a boycott by sugar suppliers - which would mean
they would have to convert 100 per cent to a sugar replacement - if they do
not co-operate.
The trade ministry is under political pressure to protect the domestic sugar
industry. Militant sugar workers hurt by the industry's privatisation have
taken over various mills while others are permanently camped in front of the
presidential palace in Mexico City.
Coca-Cola bottlers say that sooner or later competition from low-cost
imported soft drinks made with corn syrup will force them to move away from
refined sugar.
The boycott threat would be real only if domestic sugar producers can limit
the amount of sugar traded on Mexico's sugar futures market, which began
operations in March. So far only 38 per cent of monthly sugar purchases are
taking place on the market. The rest is sold directly by mills to industrial
users and by middlemen who still control about 30 per cent of the sugar
trade.
Coca-Cola bottlers say that with such little volume traded on the new
market, they would be forced to pay even higher prices for their principal
raw material should mills cancel their direct contracts. The current average
price of refined sugar traded on the futures market - Dollars 656 a tonne -
is already about 7 per cent higher than industrial users pay in their direct
contracts with refiners.

FT  09 JUN 94 / World Trade News: IFC hopes to set up Palestinian funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The International Finance Corporation, the World Bank's private sector arm,
hopes this year to establish the first of a series of investment funds to
promote business development in the Occupied Territories of the West Bank
and Gaza.
'If we can structure a fund in a proper fashion, we would be able to attract
a fair amount of Palestinian money abroad,' said Mr Andre Hovaguimian, IFC's
director for the region. 'We will start small - Dollars 25m to Dollars 50m.
If you start big the money will be squandered.
The fund will be 'superbly managed' by technical partners in the US or
Europe. 'So when the money is used up there is no problem in getting another
Dollars 50 or Dollars 100m.'
IFC has set up over 30 funds around the world since its first fund in South
Korea in 1982.
areas in the Occupied Territories require immediate attention: house
building, infrastructure development, and financial services. 'Employment
generation is the key to peace,' he said. 'Unless we get people off the
streets, we won't have much of a peace process.'
IFC last week approved, as its first investment on the West Bank,
participation in the Arab Palestine Investment Bank. This will be the first
comprehensive commercial and investment banking institution in the
territories which now gets by with one small bank in Gaza and branches of
two Jordanian banks.
The small institutions lack the capacity to mobilise and allocate funds for
industrial development, said Mr Hovaguimian. There are now about 3,700 small
and medium-sized enterprises and 40 large companies in the territories,
which have mostly had to rely on advances by sponsors or informally raised
short-term capital.
As is typical, IFC will only take shares of the fund - in this case up to 25
per cent. It will also extend a credit line of Dollars 25m for lending to
small and medium-sized businesses.
The Arab Bank group, a diversified international commercial and investment
banking group in Amman, will hold 51 per cent of the equity. The rest will
be subscribed by European institutions and Palestinian investors.
Various IFC projects are being studied, including the establishment of a
bank to finance housing construction. Future projects could involve
promotion of businesses making construction materials.
Mr Khaleel Ahmed, IFC investment officer, said the region had a competitive
advantage in tourism, which a real peace could promote, and in light
industry. Thanks to Israel, which established at least seven universities in
the area, the occupied territories now has a highly educated and skilled
workforce.

FT  09 JUN 94 / Jordan seeks to line up a cabinet for peace: Move to heal
rift with parliament

<TEXT>
Jordan yesterday announced a big cabinet reshuffle, in the wake of progress
in the kingdom's peace talks with Israel, in which nearly all the main
political parties, apart from the Islamists, were given posts.
The changes to 16 portfolios were aimed at closing the gap between the
government and parliament, which have had a fractious relationship since
parliamentary elections in November 1993. The key portfolios of information,
foreign affairs and finance were not, however, affected.
But by appointing a number of MPs to cabinet posts Mr Abdel Salam al-Majali,
the prime minister, had hoped to soften rising dissatisfaction against his
policies of peace and economic adjustment in the lower house.
A number of leading politicians including members of the fundamentalist
Islamic Action Front (IAF), nevertheless refused to join.
The IAF, which holds the largest bloc of 16 seats in the 80-member
parliament, is opposed to Jordan's participation in the peace process which
has reached a crucial stage.
On Tuesday, Jordan agreed with Israel to push ahead with items on its common
agenda, signed in Washington last year. If successful this may include
resolving key issues such as territorial and water disputes over the next
few months.
Mr Jawad Anani, the Jordanian information minister, said that as a result of
new developments in the peace process, Jordan must 'mobilise all our
energies and unite'.
The regime's failure to persuade the Islamists and other influential figures
to join the government, however, is likely to mean that tension between
parliament and cabinet will continue. Despite this, King Hussein said he was
pleased with the new government and hoped that the Lower House and cabinet
would work together constructively towards peace.

FT  09 JUN 94 / Seoul sanctions plea is snubbed: China, N Korea
'interdependent'

<TEXT>
Mr Han Sung-joo, South Korea's foreign minister, arrived last night in
Beijing on a hastily-arranged mission to seek Chinese support for sanctions
against North Korea, as China re-affirmed the closeness of relations with
Pyongyang.
China's President Jiang Zemin told North Korea's military chief of staff
ties between their two countries were 'interdependent, like teeth and lips,'
according to the Chinese news agency Xinhua.
South Korea's President Kim Young-sam said sanctions were unavoidable if
North Korea kept refusing full nuclear inspections. Mr Lee Hong-koo, South
Korea's national unification minister, predicted it would take two to four
weeks for the UN Security Council to adopt a resolution seeking sanctions.
The US, Japan and South Korea are backing a resolution to impose immediate
but gradually-escalating sanctions; China is opposing the plan and urging
continued talks instead. 'Sanctions are not a sensible choice; they would
only aggravate the crisis,' the China Daily newspaper quoted foreign
minister Qian Qichen.
Japan's foreign minister is to fly to Beijing over the weekend. Prime
Minister Tsutomu Hata remained hopeful Beijing would be able to convince
North Korea to agree to inspections. 'China has tremendous influence over
North Korea. It is making various kinds of efforts through dialogue which I
hope continues.'
On a visit to Kiev, Ukraine, North Korea's foreign minister, Mr Kim
Yong-nam, urged the US to sit down 'for a third round of talks'. Nuclear
inspections could then be allowed and nuclear fuel preserved and measured,
he added. If direct North Korean-US dialogue was not resumed, 'not only
won't the nuclear problem be solved, but it will seriously aggravate the
situation.'
Last night Mr Mike McCurry, US State Department spokesman, did not rule out
the possibility of new talks but said Washington did not at present believe
there was a basis for these. Another State Department official, deputy
spokeswoman Christine Shelly, said North Korea had crossed a 'point of no
return' by unloading virtually all 8,000 fuel rods from its nuclear reactor
at Yongbyon, thereby destroying evidence about its past use of plutonium.
Pyongyang has threatened to quit the nuclear non-proliferation treaty if
sanctions are imposed. 'The target of North Korea's nuclear weapons is us.
We have to stop North Korea from developing them at any cost,' South Korea's
President Kim told the National Security Council.

Thailand's coalition government was last night struggling to deal with a
protest in favour of constitutional reform that threatens to become a
political crisis.
A marginal political figure, Mr Chalard Vorachat, a former MP, has projected
himself into the forefront of national political debate with a two-week
hunger strike to demand the scrapping of the constitution, drafted in the
aftermath of a 1991 military coup. About 3,000 people rallied outside the
Thai parliament yesterday in his support, echoing protests that eventually
brought down a military-dominated government in May 1992.
Compromise appeared to have been reached on Tuesday when officials from
Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai's Democrat party gave support for a proposal
from Mr Chalard for a special committee to study ways to draft a new
constitution. But hours later Democrat officials denied that support and
expressed opposition to a new constitution.

Thailand's coalition government was last night struggling to deal with a
protest in favour of constitutional reform that threatens to blow up into a
political crisis.
A marginal political figure, Mr Chalard Vorachat, a former MP, has projected
himself into the forefront of national political debate with a two-week
hunger strike to demand the scrapping of the constitution, drafted in the
aftermath of a 1991 military coup.
About 3,000 people rallied outside the Thai parliament yesterday in his
support, echoing protests that eventually brought down a military-dominated
government in May 1992. The government has rejected his demands saying there
are no legal provisions for scrapping the constitution and any changes must
be made by amending the present one.
Compromise appeared to have been reached on Tuesday when officials from
Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai's Democrat party expressed support for a
proposal from Mr Chalard for a special committee to study ways to draft a
new constitution. But hours later Democrat officials denied that support and
expressed firm opposition to a new constitution.
The switch raised the political temperature on Wednesday and posed questions
about the stability of the coalition.
There remains the danger that the coalition's Palang Dharma (Buddhist way)
party, led by the unpredictable former mayor of Bangkok Mr Chamlong Srimuang
who has taken Mr Chalard's side, may put pressure on Mr Chuan so he has to
replace Palang Dharma with a right-wing party or dissolve parliament.
The opposition, which recently combined with the military-dominated Senate
to throw out the government's own attempt at reforming the constitution,
have performed a classic political U-turn to support Mr Chalard.
Dr Weng Tochirakarn, a member of the newly-created Organisation for
Political Reform, said 'I am not happy. The tension has now increased and it
could lead to serious consequences.'

FT  09 JUN 94 / Japanese Diet passes budget 2 months late
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The lower house of the Japanese parliament last night agreed the nation's
Y73,000bn (Pounds 461bn) budget for the current year, two months late
because of political infighting.
This will come as a relief to the business community, and enables the
embattled minority government of Mr Tsutomu Hata to open talks on a pact
with the opposition Social Democratic party, in an attempt to cling to
power.
The two main opposition groups, the Liberal Democratic party and the SDP,
had declared a political amnesty until passage of the budget, after the SDP
had left the government seven weeks ago.
Until recently, the two groups had planned to call a no-confidence vote
against the government soon after the budget's passage. But the SDP has
hinted over the past week it might rejoin the coalition. It wants Mr Hata to
resign and resubmit himself as prime minister to atone for the formation in
April of a centre-right group, called Kaishin (innovation), which appeared
to exclude the Socialists from policy making and prompted them to walk out.
Mr Wataru Kubo, SDP secretary general, has said the party would also insist
that Japan refuse to take sanctions against North Korea outside the aegis of
the United Nations. The Socialists also wish to discuss tax reform, where
they oppose government plans for an increase in consumption tax, and the
formation of policies - a reference to their distaste for Kaishin.
Negotiations between the coalition and the SDP are expected to begin in the
next week. SDP officials believe that rejoining the coalition might be the
party's only chance of returning to government, say political analysts in
Tokyo, The Socialists were in opposition for 47 years until joining the
coalition of former prime minister Morihiro Hosokawa last August.
The budget now goes to the upper house for debate until the end of June, a
formality. While the budget only calls for a 2.3 per cent rise in general
spending, the smallest increase in six years, the delay has prevented the
government from proposing additional expenditure.
Last night's accord was, however, earlier than many had expected because of
an agreement between the minority coalition and the opposition to delay
calling Mr Morihiro Hosokawa to testify before parliament on allegations of
financial impropriety.
He resigned in April after the LDP blocked the budget to apply pressure on
Mr Hosokawa to produce evidence to disprove allegations that he had
illicitly received cash from a trucking company and tried to conceal a share
sale for tax reasons.

A delegation of Australian MPs, among the first 'outside observers' to visit
the strife-torn island of Bougainville,
yesterday recommended that Mr Paias Wingti, Papua New Guinea's prime
minister, and other top politicians should visit the island in soon in an
effort to reconcile interest groups there.
It said it was imperative that a ceasefire be negotiated 'by whatever
processes can ensure its acceptance and maintenance by all parties' and that
'concurrently with the ceasefire, medical supplies and food should be made
freely available'. The delegation said in a report report that 'sympathetic
third party involvement' could assist this process. The notion of
establishing a regional peacekeeping force - drawn from the likes of Fiji,
Vanuatu and Tonga - has been mooted recently.
The report also suggested that Australia could host peace talks, and should
use its substantial aid programme to PNG to boost humanitarian relief and
address infrastructure problems.

The Pakistan government and Pakistan-based militant groups yesterday called
on the captors of two Britons in Indian-held Kashmir to release them
unharmed. Indian troops launched an extensive search for the two, Mr Kim
Housego, 16, and Mr David Mackie, 36, who were captured on Monday by gunmen.
The Moslem militant group Harkat-ul-Ansar said it had kidnapped them to
highlight human rights abuses by Indian troops in Kashmir. 'It is not true
that we have abducted them to secure the release of our three leaders,' the
group said in a statement delivered to the Reuters office in Srinagar,
Kashmir's summer capital.
The statement said they would not harm the Britons but warned India against
using force to free them.
A note demanding the release of three jailed guerrillas had been left with
Mr David Housego, Kim's father and former Financial Times correspondent in
New Delhi, who had been trekking south-east of Srinagar with his wife and
son and Mr and Mrs Mackie.
Pakistan condemned the kidnapping and appealed for the release of the
captives, though it also said India must stop human rights abuses in Kashmir
and release detained Kashmiri leaders.
Mr Mohammed Farooq Kashmiri, a leader of the Harkat-ul-Ansar group in
Muzaffarabad, Pakistan, said it had appealed to the captors to immediately
release the hostages: 'We have no involvement or interest in this matter.'
Mr Amanullah Khan, leader of the militant Jammu and Kashmir Liberation
Front, also called last night for the captives to be released.

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US has rediscovered the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development.
During the Reagan and Bush administrations, the Paris-based forum for
economic policy co-operation among the world's top industrial nations was of
declining interest for Washington, although the US is its biggest
shareholder. But this year's annual ministerial meeting, which finished
yesterday, attracted an unusually high-powered US delegation.
Mr Warren Christopher was the first US secretary of state to attend an OECD
ministerial meeting in over 10 years. He was flanked by Mr Lloyd Bentsen,
the Treasury secretary; Mr Ronald Brown, Commerce secretary; Mr Robert
Reich, Labour secretary; Mr Mickey Kantor, US special trade representative,
and Ms Laura Tyson, head of President Clinton's council of economic
advisers.
Mr Christopher made clear the Clinton administration had high ambitions for
the OECD. It could 'be a model and an instrument of wider integration in the
post-Cold war world', rather like its predecessor, the OEEC, in Europe in
the early post-war years.
The OECD, through its policy analysis and co-ordination, could help more
countries enter the community of advanced industrial nations, Mr Christopher
said. It could 'assume a new importance in the architecture of the global
economy, as a bridge between the Atlantic and Pacific industrial economies.'
Mr Christopher and Mr Brown praised the efforts of the OECD in recent years
and the role of its secretary-general Mr Jean-Claude Paye.
But the sudden enthusiasm of the world's largest industrial state for the
OECD is a mixed blessing for Mr Paye, who is seeking another five-year term
from the end of September after 10 years in the job. US officials stressed
yesterday they were determined to maintain their support for Mr Donald
Johnston, Canada's candidate for the post.
As expected, the meeting failed to reach consensus on the appointment,
leaving OECD ambassadors to continue talks on the merits of Mr Johnston, Mr
Paye, Mr Nigel Lawson of Britain and Mr Lorenz Schomerus of Germany.

FT  09 JUN 94 / OECD set for talks with five more states

Ministers from the 25 nations of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development yesterday moved towards expanding the Paris-based body by
approving negotiations on OECD membership with South Korea and four east
European countries.
A statement issued after the OECD's two-day annual ministerial meeting held
out the prospect of Korea becoming a member by the end of 1996 and called
for 'an early start' of negotiations on membership with the Czech Republic,
Hungary, Poland and Slovakia.
As a further indication of the OECD's increasingly outward-looking nature in
the post-cold war world, the organisation and the Russian government
yesterday agreed to step up the flow of economic assistance from the OECD to
Russia.
Under the terms of a joint declaration on co-operation, the OECD will
develop a policy dialogue with Russia, assisting the design and
implementation of economic reforms aimed at helping Russia build a
market-based economy.
This year's ministerial meeting was notable for the participation of Mexico,
which joined the organisation as its first new member in more than two
decades a few weeks ago. In their statement after the meeting, ministers
said this marked 'the beginning of a new phase in the OECD's development'.
The four former communist east European countries have applied formally to
join the organisation. South Korea, which already participates in many of
the OECD's committees and activities, intends to apply for membership this
year with a view to joining in 1996. The OECD will examine the terms of
Korea's membership as soon as Seoul is ready to do so.
Separate negotiations with each of the four European applicants could begin
soon. However, yesterday's statement gave no indication as to when they
might be admitted to the organisation.
Mr Jean-Claude Paye, the OECD secretary-general, said it was possible one or
other of the east European countries might join the OECD at the same time as
Korea. But the former communist states would have to adapt their legislation
to meet the terms of membership as well as be acceptable to the existing
member countries.
Bulgaria, Romania and Slovenia have also asked the OECD for policy advice
and the organisation may also help the Baltic states. The OECD intends to
explore possibilities for co-operation with China and maintain its policy
dialogue with the fast-growing newly-industrialising countries of Asia and
Latin America.
Yesterday, Mr Paye suggested Russia might one day become an OECD member. Mr
Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, also urged Russia's integration
with the west; it was 'the best investment we can make in our security and
in the security of all the peoples of Europe'.
According to Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister and one of the
signatories of the agreement with Russia, the OECD intends 'to focus in
particular on helping develop the legal and institutional infrastructure
necessary for the functioning of a market economy in Russia.'
The Paris-based body will carry out a comprehensive survey of the Russian
economy and offer advice on economic restructuring and reform of Russia's
tax and statistical systems.
Russian experts will be invited to take part in specialised OECD committees.
OECD officials will have access to senior Russian policy makers and to the
economic information needed for drawing up a programme for Russia. They will
be given the same legal status and protection as officials of other
international economic organisations.
Russia has been receiving OECD economic assistance since 1991 on a wide
range of issues, including statistics, privatisation, competition policy,
financial sector reform and social security. The agreement signed yesterday
will intensify this co-operation.

FT  09 JUN 94 / HK to release building land
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Hong Kong government yesterday announced measures, including an increase
in the supply of land for residential development and changes to the way
builders bring property to market, which it hopes will check the rate of
price rises in Hong Kong's overheated residential property market.
The government's overriding objective has been to be seen doing something
about rising house prices, but not enough to precipitate a crash in the
value of what remains most people's principal asset. Yesterday's mainly
supply-side measures were seen by analysts as fitting that requirement.
The government said it planned to allocate an extra 70 hectares of land for
residential development in the years before 1997-98, including 15ha in the
current year. The release of this land, however, will need China's approval.
Beijing has in the past indicated its concern about property prices but has
yet to give its response. The government also reminded China that an early
agreement on financing Hong Kong's new airport would free even more land for
residential development.
The government has asked property developers to cut to 10 per cent from 50
per cent the number of flats they allocate to insiders, such as staff and
associates. On current levels of construction this would add 10,000 flats to
the open market. It has also made changes to rules governing the pre-sale of
housing and its financing.
Mr David Faulkner, partner with Brooke Hillier Parker, a firm of surveyors,
said: 'I think it's going to dampen enthusiasm. But it won't lead to a
crash, there are too many genuine buyers out there.'
Residential property in Hong Kong has become prohibitively expensive for
ordinary people. A 600 sq ft flat on the south side of Hong Kong island
costs about HKDollars 3.5m (Pounds 301,000). The market has been propelled
upwards by strong demand from the mainland - where a Hong Kong flat is seen
as a status symbol - and the growth of the colony as a financial and
business centre for foreigners doing business in China.
The government said it would monitor the effect on property prices of
yesterday's measures. If 'excessive speculation' continued it would consider
introducing tougher measures, such as punitive stamp duty on short-term
transactions and financial penalties for hoarders of empty flats.

FT  09 JUN 94 / Housewife who built empire from nothing: China's economic
surge is producing a new breed of tycoon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As China's economic surge throws up a new breed of tycoons, few can be more
unusual than Mrs Rabia Kader.
Mrs Kader is an ethnic Uighur Moslem who has built up a business empire out
of nothing in Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang Province in the far west of
China. She has managed to do so despite the deep-seated worries of the
Chinese authorities about the position of the ethnic minorities who make up
60 per cent of Xinjiang's 15m population.
A 4 square metre shop which Mrs Kader opened in 1982 has turned into a
10,000 square metre shopping centre in the heart of Urumqi. The centre is
only part of fast-growing property, trading, agricultural and manufacturing
interests grouped under the umbrella of her Xinjiang Arkider Industrial and
Commercial Corporation.
'What I have gained today is not something easy,' Mrs Kader said in an
interview during a visit to London. 'It is the result of long struggle and
of not sleeping for many months. People say I am made of iron. And it is
true.'
Mrs Kader is in Britain to seek UK investment in Xinjiang, to buy machinery
for her factories and to find a location for a Uighur restaurant she would
like to set up in London. She also wants to set up shops selling silk,
fruits and other Xinjiang produce.
She is reluctant to talk in detail about the problems she faced in
establishing herself. Before the death of Mao Zedong in 1976, she was a
housewife eking out extra income through buying and selling goods such as
wood and liang fu, a Uighur concoction of tomato powder and garlic said to
be good for the digestion.
'We were always depressed,' she says of that time. 'Any initiative was
assumed to be capitalist.' But, starting with only the equivalent of Dollars
10, she began to do business in earnest as early as 1977, the year before
Deng Xiaoping began to open up the economy.
In 1980, with her eighth child only 40 days old, she embarked on a gruelling
tour of China's big cities, beginning in Shanghai. 'At that time I hardly
spoke Chinese at all. I brought together buyers and sellers and even cooked
Moslem food for Islamic businessmen.'
Mrs Kader traded textiles, clothes and food. She bought goods from Moslems
who had gone on pilgrimages to Mecca. The small shop she opened in Urumqi in
1982 became a rapidly-growing focus for her business.
As the 1980s unfolded, successive relaxations of official controls made it
easier to do business, culminating in last year's award to border provinces
of privileges similar to those enjoyed by the booming coastal regions.
Mrs Kader is careful to give credit to the central government in Beijing and
the provincial authorities in Urumqi. 'In the past 15 years since Deng
Xiaoping came to power, China has been moving in the right direction.'
Although she is a member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference, an advisory body on which elder statesmen and other successful
figures sit, Mrs Kader professes to have no interest in politics. 'I am just
an entrepreneur,' she says. 'I concentrate on making money and on how I can
contribute to the economy of Xinjiang Province. I don't pay attention to
politics at all.'
Her protestations are understandable, given her sensitive position, as well
as that of her husband, who is a scholar of Uighur history. Uighurs, whose
language is close to Uzbek and Turkish, number 7m in Xinjiang, China's
largest province by area, though ethnic Han Chinese tend to occupy top
official positions.
The Chinese authorities are perennially concerned about Uighur nationalism,
especially following the break-up of the Soviet Union and the emergence of
the new 'silk route' states which border on or are close to Xinjiang, and
with which Mrs Kader trades actively.
China's premier, Mr Li Peng, toured Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan and
Kazakhstan in April, seeking to strengthen commercial ties partly to ward
off ethnically-inspired friction; in Kazakhstan, for example, there are
militant Uighurs who seek independence for Xinjiang.
Mrs Kader's success is controversial even within the Uighur community.
'Moslem women are normally supposed to stay at home and look after their
husband. It is very rare for a Moslem woman to travel so widely. A lot of
people complained and were jealous.'
But, she says, 'I am determined I must succeed. If a man can do it, a woman
can do it too.'
Her present fortune can only be guessed at, but is substantial. She says she
does not want to pass on the business to her 11 children, whose ages range
from 30 to 3, because she wants them instead to acquire knowledge, for
example of high technology. 'I will pay for their degrees in subjects which
are useful to society, because I did not have such an opportunity.'

FT  09 JUN 94 / Patten censured by legislature: Governor 'reproved' over
budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor, yesterday made colonial history when
he became the first of the colony's 28 governors to be censured by the local
legislature.
By a vote of 21 to 11 the Legislative Council (LegCo) voted in favour of a
motion 'reproving' Mr Patten for 'acting against to will of the public' in
denying LegCo the right to amend the government's budget.
More important than the actual point of contention was the ill-feeling
towards Mr Patten that emanated from the pro-democracy wing of LegCo -
hitherto the governor's staunchest body of support. Last night he was
accused of being 'dictatorial', 'colonial' and falling short of his own
rhetoric about 'accountability'.
Recently Mr Patten has rebuffed pro-democracy legislators' attempts to
promote civil liberties. His supporters believe he has been reigned in by
the British government which has lost its stomach for any more fights with
China about Hong Kong.
A broad coalition of legislators had wanted to reduce property taxes.
Under Hong Kong's constitution - the Queen's instructions to the governor -
only the executive branch of government can tax or spend taxpayers money. Mr
Patten, as his predecessor had done, invoked the Royal Instructions to
thwart a proposed amendment.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The growing challenge to the presence of neo-fascist members of the new
Italian government in European Union institutions widened further yesterday,
when another EU ministerial meeting was held up by a protest from Belgium.
Yesterday's incident, at a council of environment ministers in Luxembourg,
follows a denunciation of the Italian neo-fascist leadership at the weekend
by Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, and the decision
on Tuesday by all four main Dutch parties to boycott the Commission if Rome
names a far-right candidate as one of its two commissioners.
At the end of last month, an EU telecommunications council was held up when
the Belgian Socialist minister, Mr Elio de Rupio, refused to shake hands
with his Italian opposite number, Mr Giuseppe Tatarella, deputy prime
minister for the far-right National Alliance (AN-MSI), 'deploring' his
presence in a democratic forum.
Yesterday, Mr Jacques Santkin, the Belgian Socialist environment minister,
marked the presence of another Italian neo-fascist, environment minister
Altero Matteoli, with a statement underlining the obligation of EU ministers
to defend democratic principles.
The recent commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the D-Day landings to
liberate Europe from fascism, he said, 'should make us reaffirm loudly and
clearly the fundamentals of democracy'.
Mr Matteoli replied that 'the principles of freedom and democracy referred
to will never be put in doubt'. He also pointed out that President Bill
Clinton began his D-Day remembrance trip to Europe in Italy, and had showed
no compunction in meeting AN-MSI ministers and the party leader, Mr
Gianfranco Fini.
Mr Delors, however, responded on French television at the weekend to recent
remarks by Mr Fini by saying that 'we must move from a vigorous vigilance'
of the Italian far-right 'to a more concerned vigilance'.
Mr Fini had said that the fascism of Mussolini had been positive until the
1938 racial laws; that Europe had lost its cultural identity as a result of
the D-Day landings; and that 'there are moments when freedom is not an
essential value'. Mr Delors said: 'I read (this) with anger in my heart.'
The position of the Dutch parties was underlined by Mr Gijs de Vries, a
prominent right-wing liberal MEP, who warned that the European parliament
would veto the new Commission if it contained an Italian neo-fascist.
The dominant Socialist group at Strasbourg, set to bolster its position in
this week's Euro-elections, voted in May to boycott all Italian neo-fascists
in EU institutions.
Italian government officials indicated yesterday that it was unlikely that
Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the prime minister, would name an AN-MSI candidate for
Brussels, favouring instead Mr Enrico Vinci, current secretary-general of
the European parliament, and Mr Marco Panella, the maverick Radical party
MEP and national MP.
Some EU diplomats also said Mr Berlusconi was unlikely to back Belgium's
premier, Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, favoured by France and Germany to succeed Mr
Delors next year, in the light of successive Belgian snubs to his ministers.
All the main candidates to succeed Mr Delors are courting the Italian
premier before the Corfu EU summit on June 24-25.

The German government yesterday gave the go-ahead for a publicity offensive
to promote part-time working, aimed at persuading employers to provide more
part-time jobs for an estimated 2.5m workers. Details of legal protection
for part-time workers, potential productivity gains for employers, and
pension rights, will be advertised in 30m newspapers and magazines, and
100,000 brochures. The current proportion of workers employed part-time in
Germany is only 15.5 per cent. compared with 34.3 per cent in the
Netherlands, and 23.7 per cent in Sweden. The government's campaign does not
intend to offer financial incentives to employers, but a draft law will give
part-time workers the right to claim full unemployment benefit for three
years after they switch from full-time employment.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission yesterday postponed a decision on whether to approve
a revised rescue plan for the steel industry. Mr Martin Bangemann, industry
commissioner, asked for a week's delay in order to review the treatment of
Ecu415m (Pounds 319.5m) Italian state aid in exchange for closure of
steel-making capacity in Brescia, northern Italy. The Italian closures are
crucial for reaching the target of cutting EU capacity by 19m tonnes, with
the Brescia mini-mills contributing 5m-6m tonnes. But the complex
cross-ownership of the mills means not all companies linked to steel-making
would shut down. This raises legal problems about state aid being used to
fund 'partial closures'. Mr Bangemann is pressing for a more flexible
interpretation of rules on steel aid which would focus on capacity cuts
rather than ownership, overturning a Commission decision in favour of a
rigorous application of the rules. Mr Bangemann signalled yesterday he was
unhappy with a compromise which would have opened infringement proceedings
against the Italians for illegal subsidies, while pressing Rome to come up
with a new package of state aid to the Brescia mills. But Brussels officials
remain hopeful of agreement next week.

<TEXT>
The warring factions in Bosnia yesterday signed a United Nations-brokered
agreement for a one-month nationwide ceasefire and an immediate exchange of
all prisoners. The truce is due to come into force at noon local time
tomorrow The surprise accord came after Mr Yasushi Akashi, the UN's special
envoy for ex-Yugoslavia, had said late on Tuesday that it would take 'a
miracle' to get a deal. While yesterday's pact falls far short of the
four-month truce he had sought at the start of talks on Monday, it was, he
said, 'a first step' towards a complete cessation of hostilities. The two
sides have agreed to refrain from 'any offensive military operations or
other provocative actions'. Unlike in the original UN plan, there is no
provision for pulling back heavy weapons from the frontlines or for the
separation of forces by UN troops. Instead, the UN Protection Force
(Unprofor) will merely 'monitor' the ceasefire. The pact represents a moral
victory for the mainly Moslem Bosnian government, which had pressed for a
four-week renewable ceasefire linked to negotiations on a political
settlement for Bosnia.

Shipping lines should not be allowed to fix prices for the land leg of
long-haul deliveries, the European Commission said yesterday. A report by Mr
Karel Van Miert, competition commissioner, says that shipping 'conferences'
 -powerful agreements between shipping lines - would be contravening
competition rules if they agreed to fix prices on road or rail transport to
and from ports. At present, shipping conferences have a bloc exemption from
competition rules on the port-to-port leg of journeys, allowing them to fix
common rates. They argue that they be unprofitable, otherwise. However, big
EU exporters say the shipping lines are behaving as an illegal cartel and
imposing exorbitant prices. The report, approved by the Commission
yesterday, will be presented to transport ministers at next week's council
meeting.

US chemicals company Union Carbide has challenged yesterday's go-ahead from
the European Commission for a Dollars 3bn (Pounds 2bn) plastics joint
venture between the Anglo-Dutch company Royal Dutch/Shell and Italy's
Montedison. The two European companies had made last-minute concessions on
their control of polypropylene manufacturing technologies in order to
overcome accusations that they would breach EU competition law. But Union
Carbide said it was considering an appeal to the European Court. 'We do not
share the European Commission's view that the changes to the proposed
venture eliminate anti-trust concern,' said the company.
The joint operation, known as Montell, will have a market share estimated by
Shell at 18-19 per cent, making it easily the world's biggest polypropylene
manufacturer. Polypropylene is a tough plastic widely used by the car
industry for such items as bumpers and battery casings. The Commission
approved the deal on condition that Montedison kept control of Spheripol,
its proprietary method for the polypropylene manufacture. Shell Oil, the US
arm of Royal Dutch/Shell, already has control over another manufacturing
technology, Unipol, through a separate venture with Union Carbide. The
concessions put forward ensured Montell would not contravene EU competition
rules, said the Commission.

At the same time, share ownership was encouraged by the introduction of a
withholding tax of 12.5 per cent, which will replace a more complex
assessment structure. Companies were also encouraged to list on the stock
market by giving a tax break on the cost of listing.
The employment measures are in line with the guidelines released this week
by the OECD and mark a radical break with longstanding job protection
practices. But they are also intended to underline that Mr Silvio
Berlusconi's government is 'business friendly'.
They centre on a mix of tax breaks, simplifying the tax structure and
financial incentives to create jobs. Next week, the government is expected
to announce an easing of restrictions on youth and temporary employment.
Mr Giulio Tremonti, the finance minister and the tax expert behind the bulk
of the measures, insisted that they would come at no extra cost to the
Treasury.
Trade unions have been consulted about the measures but have raised serious
objections over lowering the minimum wage for youth employment and the
Berlusconi government's clear desire to introduce part-time jobs.
But the government has argued that longstanding rigidities in the labour
market are a principal cause of Italy's 30 per cent youth unemployment.
Officials have also told the unions that Italy lags well behind the rest of
Europe in the use of part-time workers, with only 5.5 per cent of the
workforce involved against 12 per cent in France and 15 per cent in Germany.
During his election campaign, Mr Berlusconi promised, if elected prime
minister, to create 1m jobs. He has since played down this commitment but
says that some 300,000 new jobs can be found this year.
The measures were the main item on the agenda at a cabinet meeting which
began yesterday evening. One of the principal innovations was a tax rebate
of up to 25 per cent of salary for any business that hired for 'an
indeterminate period' someone who was either unemployed, a first-time
job-seeker or handicapped.
Tax incentives were also made available for people starting up companies or
increasing their investment. First- time entrepreneurs up to 30 years old or
those currently unemployed will have a tax holiday for their first six
months in business.
Taxes will also encourage profits to be reinvested.
The measures to boost share ownership mark an important departure. Until
now, shares have had to be declared on income tax forms and have been
assessed as part of a person's overall income and taxed accordingly. Now,
shareholders will pay a single 12.5 per cent tax - the same as that on
government bonds - deducted anonymously at source.

West European new car sales rose year-on-year by an estimated 12.9 per cent
in May to 1.09m, the biggest monthly increase this year. The slow recovery
in the new car market achieved in the first quarter was halted in April by a
fall of 2 per cent year-on-year.
Provisional figures released yesterday by the European Automobile
Manufacturers Association (Acea) suggest that the setback was only
temporary, however, as sales rose sharply year-on-year in France and Spain
and in several of the smaller European markets led by Scandinavia, Greece
and Ireland. In the first five months of the year new car sales in west
Europe are estimated by Acea to have risen by 5.6 per cent to 5.43m. Sales
in the whole of 1993 fell by 15.2 per cent to 11.45m, the steepest decline
in the post-war period.

The increase in orders for west Germany's manufacturing industry slowed in
April to just 0.5 per cent over the previous month, compared to a 3.1 per
cent increase in March. The main factor behind the slowdown was a reduction
in export orders of 1.5 per cent, according to the federal statistics
office, whereas domestic orders actually increased by 2 per cent.
Net direct foreign investment into Hungary rose to Dollars 78m in March from
Dollars 20m in February, the National Bank of Hungary said. The cumulative
total of Dollars 186m in the first quarter of the year was down from Dollars
296m in the first quarter of last year.

FT  09 JUN 94 / Carbide challenges EU plastic decision
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Union Carbide, the US chemicals company, has challenged yesterday's go-ahead
from the European Commission for a Dollars 3bn (Pounds 2bn) plastics joint
venture between the Anglo-Dutch company Royal Dutch/Shell and Italy's
Montedison.
The two European companies had made last minute concessions on their control
of polypropylene manufacturing technologies to overcome accusations they
would breach EU competition law. But Union Carbide said it was considering
an appeal to the European Court of Justice.
'We do not share the European Commission's view that the changes to the
proposed venture eliminate anti-trust concern,' said the company.
The joint operation, known as Montell, will have a market share estimated by
Shell at 18-19 per cent, making it easily the world's biggest polypropylene
manufacturer.
Polypropylene is a tough plastic widely used by the car industry for items
including bumpers and battery casings.
The Commission approved the deal on condition that Montedison kept control
of its proprietary method for the polypropylene manufacture, Spheripol.
Shell Oil, the US arm of Royal Dutch/Shell, already has control over another
manufacturing technology, Unipol, through a separate venture with Union
Carbide. The concessions put forward ensured Montell would not contravene EU
competition rules, said the Commission.
The main undertaking offered by the two parties is a commitment to keep
separate two rival technologies for polypropylene production. Montedison
will keep Spheripol separate from the joint venture in a distinct, new
enterprise called Technipol.
Normal competition rules will apply to any commercial discussions held
between Montell and Technipol, said the commission. Montedison agreed to
divest itself of a joint venture it has with Petrofina, the Belgian
petrochemicals company which had also objected to the creation of Montell.
The Montell venture is partly intended as a way of ridding Montedison of
Dollars 2.2bn of its debt. It is understood that the amendments to the deal
demanded by Brussels will not have a significant impact on this process.
Montedison's continued control over its sought-after polypropylene
technology could benefit the group, which will continue to license the
technology to Montell's competitors.

FT  09 JUN 94 / Hungary lifts repo rate by 2%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BUDAPEST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Hungary's central bank yesterday lifted its key repo interest rates by 2 per
cent and has also announced a three point rise in the base rate to 25 per
cent. Financial markets had expected a tightening of monetary policy after
parliamentary elections last month but the scale of the move came as a
surprise. The National Bank of Hungary said the measure was needed to
curtail domestic demand and bring down a persistent external deficit.
Figures released yesterday showed a worse-than-expected first-quarter
current account deficit of Dollars 809m, little down on the record Dollars
900m registered in the same period of 1993. Hungary ran a Dollars 3.46bn
current account deficit in 1993 as a whole, equivalent to about 10 per cent
of GDP. But the central bank council, saying monetary restriction alone
could not right the external imbalance, called on the new Socialist
government to exercise parallel fiscal restraint and reduce a budget deficit
forecast at Ft330bn (Dollars 3.2bn) for 1994.

FT  09 JUN 94 / Light escape likely for Balsam bankers: How Germany's newest
scandal contrasts to the Schneider case
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Following shortly after the collapse of the Jurgen Schneider property group,
Germany's large banks have been hit by another case of alleged fraud at a
heavily indebted company.
The company at the centre of the new debacle is Balsam, a manufacturer of
flooring materials used to make tennis courts, artificial surfaces for
football pitches and running tracks and other sports installations, based in
the town of Steinhagen near Bielefeld in Westphalia. Balsam owes DM1.6bn
(Pounds 640m) and its entire four-man board was arrested earlier this week
on suspicion of credit fraud.
Deutsche Bank, Dresdner Bank, Westdeutsche Landesbank and other large German
institutions own an indirect 15 per cent stake in Balsam via WFG Deutsche
Gesellschaft fur Wagniskapital, a venture capital company. Despite this
bankers said yesterday that the direct and indirect credit risk is spread
between 40 banks and that no individual bank is owed more than DM100m.
This contrasts with the case of Schneider, where banks are owed DM5bn and
Deutsche Bank alone is owed DM1.2bn, against which it has had to make a
DM500m provision.
But although the Schneider case was significantly bigger than Balsam, there
are parallels. Both companies were led by charismatic entrepreneurs whose
apparent wealth served to dampen bankers' fears about mounting debts.
Just as Mr Jurgen Schneider, the property entrepreneur whose disappearance
triggered the property crisis, always paid his interest bill on time - so Mr
Friedel Balsam, chief executive of the floorings group, was always punctual
in meeting his payments to bankers.
'Moreover he was always willing and able to inject further cash into the
business from his own resources,' said one banker yesterday.
It was perhaps for this reason that bankers were indifferent to the scale of
Balsam's debts which seem vast for a company with turnover of a modest
DM460m and net profits of only DM15m last year. This parallels bankers'
nonchalance about a rapid build-up of debt at Schneider prior to his recent
disappearance.
Bankers, due to gather last night in Wiesbaden for their first talks on
Balsam, said the company's biggest direct creditor was Procedo, Germany's
largest factoring company. Factoring, a financing technique which is in its
infancy in Germany, is at the heart of the alleged fraud.
Factoring companies advance cash to their customers against the security of
unpaid invoices. They take a commission for the service provided and assume
responsibility for collecting their customers' outstanding receivables.
According to Mr Jost Schmiedeskamp, state prosecutor in Bielefeld, the four
directors of Balsam have been arrested on suspicion of forging documentation
to support factoring agreements.
Mr Schmiedeskamp said the board stood accused of concocting large orders
from foreign customers, or of inflating the value of real contracts by a
factor of 60 in some cases. The invoices for these fictitious orders were
presented to Procedo in conjunction with documents purporting to be from a
US bank and a US accounting firm, but these documents were alleged by the
prosecutor to be fraudulent.
He said that the cash raised against the invoices was used by Mr Balsam and
his boardroom colleagues to speculate in the currency markets. The fraud has
allegedly been running for a number of years and the state prosecutor said
it opened its investigations into the case in late 1992.
The alleged fraud is given an added twist by the fact that Mr Balsam, 85 per
cent shareholder in the flooring company, is also a minority shareholder in
the company he is accused of defrauding: together with his finance director
he has has a 3.9 per cent stake in Procedo. But business between Procedo and
Balsam was conducted on an arms' length basis, Procedo has insisted. Balsam
is believed to have been Procedo's biggest customer, but how much Procedo is
owed has not yet emerged. Neither is it clear how much Procedo itself owes
the banks with which it refinanced its factoring business.
For bankers mulling on the similarities to the Schneider case, there is one
consolation: while Mr Schneider's whereabouts are unknown Mr Balsam is at
least behind bars.

FT  09 JUN 94 / Battle joined in Russia over defence spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A fierce struggle over Russia's military budget is coming to a head in
Moscow. On it may depend the survival of the government, further economic
reform and the political neutrality and effectiveness of the armed forces.
The struggle pits the military and defence industry against the still shaky
reformist forces and their erratic push to create a functioning market
economy.
Big concessions to the military's demands for much higher spending - claimed
by the defence establishment as essential if a military revolt is to be
avoided - would destroy attempts to contain spending and control inflation
to its present levels of under 10 per cent a month.
The intensity of the fight reflects the lack of progress in two years of
reform in restructuring the vast defence establishment, which includes the
military forces, the reconstituted and expanded border guards, interior
ministry troops and the intelligence operatives (former KGB).
The military is underfunded, under-employed, badly housed, often unpaid and
receptive to extreme nationalist and Communist influence and increasingly
aggressive in its own defence.
Pressure to increase military spending is beginning to tell on the country's
democratic institutions. The state duma, or lower house of parliament,
yesterday passed the 1994 budget within the limits set by the government -
with income set at Rbs124,000bn and specified payments set at Rbs194,000bn -
though it increased military spending from Rbs37,000bn to Rbs40,500bn,
largely by cutting repayments of foreign debt.
The Federation Council, or upper house, has already said it will increase
military spending to Rbs55,000bn when it reviews the budget.
But a senior military adviser close to Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the prime
minister, warned yesterday that official spending of Rbs55,000bn would
breach an important deficit pledge made by the prime minister to the
International Monetary Fund and could force Mr Chernomyrdin's resignation.
The official figure may greatly understate true spending. Mr Vitaly Shlykov,
a former deputy Soviet and Russian defence minister and the country's main
expert on military production, said the Rbs55,000bn figure was a 'game' and
that true expenditure would inevitably be much higher because budget outlays
not specifically identified as military would, in fact, be devoted to the
services. .
The crisis is deepened by the fact that budget income is now lagging well
behind target. Mr Sergei Kondrashyev, deputy head of the finance ministry's
military expenditure department, told a hearing of the state duma's defence
committee on Tuesday that in the first five months of this year the ministry
had received only 15 per cent of the year's total revenue - or 36 per cent
of the revenue it should have collected for the period.
Mr Shlykov said that President Boris Yeltsin had last month written to Mr
Chernomyrdin, expressing his support for the higher spending on the
military. Mr Chernomyrdin, who earlier this week flew to Germany for medical
treatment, had so far held fast to the spending figure of Rbs40,500bn - but
the pressure on him was now intense.
'The military and the defence industry are now fused together in a very
powerful lobby,' said Mr Shlykov. 'We might see a change of government
because of this struggle'.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
'You bet I am going to vote in the European elections,' said Ms Gisela Bose,
a 58-year-old mother of three sons. 'And I will tell you why. We have to
keep the Nazis out. A low turn-out will play into their hands.'
As an east German, this is the first time Ms Bose has had the chance to vote
in these elections. Yet she and many of the residents of the Rosenfelder
Ring housing estate in Friedrichsfelde, a socially-mixed district of east
Berlin, cannot name their European parliament candidates.
'We have no idea who they are or what they look like,' said Ms Bose. 'They
never come around here. I have never seen any of them campaigning. The only
thing we know about the European parliament is through the television. I
haven't a clue what any of the candidates stand for.'
Mr Gunther Kombino agrees. 'Nevertheless, I will vote. But at my age - I am
65 - the European elections mean very little to me. They are more important
for my children. They like to travel,' he said. 'I could not do any of that
when the Wall divided Germany. If we have a bigger Union, they will be able
to travel without any bother. Maybe we should expand Europe to the countries
of eastern Europe, and to Switzerland, and to Scandinavia. By the way, who
is standing in our district?'
One of the candidates is Mr Hans-Wilhelm Ebeling, a member of Chancellor
Helmut Kohl's governing Christian Democrats. Mr Ebeling, 60, lives in a
large bungalow on a quiet, tree-lined street just a 10-minute walk across
the tram tracks from the Rosenfelder Ring estate.
He holds different views about how the European Union should be enlarged and
what values it should hold. 'I support some degree of enlargement. But it
should extend to the Christian countries with humanist values. I don't think
I would go beyond the Urals.'
A former theologian who, in the heady days of German unification, tried to
set up in eastern Germany a sister party of the Bavarian-based Christian
Social Union, Mr Ebeling would also like to see a ban on parties such as the
far-right Republicans, and even the Party of Democratic Socialism, the
successor to east Germany's former Communist party. 'They are not
democrats,' he said.
Mr Norbert Glante, his Social Democratic counterpart in Potsdam, does not
believe in drawing up new borders in Europe. 'The European parliament should
try to open up borders with eastern Europe and Russia. It is really
important for the east Germans to have more trade and better contacts with
the east. We are all in Europe together.' If the 41-year-old former
technician is elected - and his chances are high since his constituency
around Brandenburg is SPD - he would lobby for more funds for roads and
infrastructure from this part of eastern Germany to the east.
Yet, however much the voters and the candidates differ on where Europe
starts and ends, they share one common aspiration: EU countries should have
a united policy on crime, security and youth. 'Now the borders are open,
there's so much crime and the youth are being dragged into it,' said Ms
Bose. 'Then they start drifting into neo-Nazi groups and start getting
violent. This cannot continue. This is a European problem.'

FT  09 JUN 94 / European Elections - June 9 and 12: Aid barely lifts
Andalucia - Region languishes despite quantities of EU cash
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE

<TEXT>
Hundreds of German and Dutch families moved down to La Carolina in southern
Spain but discovered the homes they were promised were still unbuilt. The
promoter had called it 'the gateway of happiness'. Instead, they found
themselves in a barren landscape where the locals treated them as loafers.
Another Costa time-share scam? Not quite. It was an experiment in farm
settlement, in 1767. Today's mayor says it created 'a European Union in
miniature'. Its remnants are some curiously tall, blond people in
surrounding villages and the occasional odd-sounding surname like Nef or
Schefle.
La Carolina is no longer the end of the world. A spanking new highway runs
close by. But these days hardly anybody goes there. There are no tourists
and few jobs to be had. Last year, two of the main employers, including a
telecommunications equipment plant belonging to Siemens of Germany, shut
down. More jobs hang precariously on the future of Suzuki's car-making
subsidiary, Santana Motor, in nearby Linares.
Linares, as near to being an industrial town as anywhere in Andalucia, has
been on a war footing for more than three months. Suzuki, fed up with paying
for losses, wants out. The whole area has taken to the streets against job
cuts. The factory fence is strung with banners pledging the support of
everybody from the fire brigade to the basketball club. The company's
Japanese executives have gone to ground.
The plant is not big by European standards, employing 2,400. But this is
more than any other single industrial facility in Andalucia, a region of
almost 7m people. And Linares, sitting among disused lead mines, has little
else. More than half the population of 60,000 depend on it directly or
indirectly.
European funds, following Spain's accession eight years ago, and a
spending-spree connected to the Seville Expo in 1992 have outwardly changed
Andalucia, with public works galore - new roads, high-speed railways,
airport buildings, drains, schools and hopeful business parks. But, at the
same time, the region's official jobless rate has risen to 34 per cent,
three times the EU average and the highest in Spain, Europe's record-holder
for unemployment. The number out of work in the region - 885,000 - has
increased by half in the past decade.
Last year, according to the Fund for Economic and Social Research,
Andalucia's gross product fell by 2.9 per cent, the sharpest recession of
any Spanish region.
Income per head is 53 per cent of European Union average. Since Spain's
entry to the EU the gap has closed a little, but less than for Spain as a
whole. 'In relative terms we are not in the group of regions that are
converging,' says Mr Alfonso Pajuelo, planning director in the economy
department of the regional government in Seville.
Villages depend heavily on payments from the government's rural employment
plan, designed to ease the plight of 200,000 seasonal farm labourers in
Andalucia and neighbouring Extremadura. Agricultural 'day-workers', who work
at least 60 days, usually moving from harvest to harvest on big estates, can
claim about Pta27,000 (Pounds 130) net a month for half the year when they
are not working. Notoriously vulnerable to fraud, the plan has cost about
Pta1,000bn since it was introduced 10 years ago. Opposition conservatives
see it as a disincentive to work. Distant from any of the standard images of
European farming, it has created its own unique brand of subsidy culture.
Andalucia is the European region which receives most structural aid from the
EU. But it has only a third as many companies as Catalonia, which has a
smaller population. Ninety per cent of those employ fewer than 50 people.
'Attempts at industrial take-off have repeatedly failed,' notes a regional
government study. There is little entrepreneurial spirit, and many
established companies - like Santana Motor - have become uncompetitive.
Mr Francisco Vallejo, La Carolina's Socialist mayor, thinks the impact of
the single market will be 'fairly negative in the short term' in the region.
'These companies worked well when the market was closed.'
Andalucia is a prime focus of attention in the European election, with
regional elections being held simultaneously on June 12. The Socialists'
outright majority in this stronghold region and their leading position in
the country as a whole are both in jeopardy. Mr Fernando Moran, the former
foreign minister who heads the list of Socialist candidates for the European
parliament, used to be MP for Jaen, the olive-growing province which
includes Linares and La Carolina. He says the south is 'a priority problem'
and hopes it will not become a distinct world like Italy's Mezzogiorno.
Government officials in Madrid say the north-south divide is less
accentuated in Spain than in some other countries. 'It is not the worst
south of southern Europe,' one commented. But the pattern of dependence  -
on Madrid, on foreign investment, on second-hand technology, on Brussels -
is far from being broken.

FT  09 JUN 94 / What we are voting for in the European Election
</HEADLINE>

   By DAVID MARSH, European Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Across Europe, 269m voters are eligible to take part in the elections for
the European parliament today and on Sunday. The vote will decide the
composition of a 567-member assembly with significantly increased powers
under the Single European Act and the Maastricht treaty, writes David Marsh,
European Editor. A pan-European opinion poll for the European Commission,
published this week, indicates that 55 per cent of the electorate will be
guided by national issues in their voting intentions, with 37 per cent
looking more to European questions.
Opinion polls show that most voters throughout the Union - with the notable
exceptions of the strongly Eurosceptical electorates in the UK and Denmark -
favour giving the European parliament more power.
At the same time, with governments in most countries suffering unpopularity
as a result of recession and unemployment, a large protest vote is likely in
many countries, led by the UK, Spain and Belgium. The election will deliver
important pointers to national contests in the next 12 months - especially
the general election in Germany in October and the presidential election in
France next May.

Voting Sunday. The Luxembourg coalition government, composed of the
Christian Socialist and Socialist parties, is firmly in favour of economic
and monetary union. Luxembourg is also a firm backer of political union. The
government parties are keen to ensure that the rights of small states are
safeguarded in the 1996 Maastricht review conference. The opposition
Liberals, formerly firmly in favour of European union, are now more
sceptical. LIKELY RESULT: The government parties are expected to maintain
their supremacy, keeping five of six seats.

<TEXT>
Voting Sunday. Italy's politicians have conducted a lack-lustre campaign
with budgets and political energies exhausted by the March general
elections.
The parties on the left and in the centre which emerged as the opposition
two months ago have based their campaigns on the calculation that Mr Silvio
Berlusconi's Forza Italia and its allies are in an unassailable position.
Thus they have avoided polemics and raised few European issues,
concentrating instead on rallying their faithful rather than gaining new
voters. Mr Berlusconi, heading the Forza Italia list in all five electoral
colleges, is using the elections as a personal referendum.
LIKELY RESULT: Polls give Forza Italia 25 per cent, 5 points up from March.
The PDS has around 23 per cent. The third largest party is the MSI at 13,
with the Northern League around 7.

Voting Sunday. The vote will be a judgment on the centre-right Social
Democrats (PSD) after almost two years of recession. It will also test the
main opposition party, the centre-left Socialists, in the run-up to a
general election in October 1995.
On European issues, the two main parties differ little. Both are strongly
pro-European. But while the Socialists openly advocate federalism, the PSD
steers away from the term in favour of less emotive expressions such as
European integration. Both favour a single currency and greater powers for
the European Parliament.
The PSD reflects growing Portuguese dissillusioment with Europe by taking a
tough stand favouring Portuguese interests, particularly over agriculture.
The Socialists have been criticising not the Common Agricultural Policy but
the PSD government for failing to invest EU farm funds wisely.
LIKELY RESULT: Polls put Socialists slightly ahead with 30 per cent against
29 per cent for PSD.

<TEXT>
Voting Sunday. The main French right- and left-wing parties and groupings
favour political and monetary union, although some of the electorate has
been showing increasing scepticism. Both left and right have had their
support eaten away by dissidents within their own camp.
On the right, the anti-Maastricht list of dissident conservatives has seen
support running unexpectedly high at 7-9 per cent. The Socialist list, led
by Mr Michel Rocard, has faced even harder competition. First, from that led
by Mr Bernard Tapie, nominally an ally and a declared European federalist,
but whose only policy is to make youth unemployment illegal. Second, from
the 'Bosnia' list led by Mr Leon Schwartzenberg campaigning for an end to
the Bosnian Moslems arms embargo. In some polls it has scored the 5 per cent
minimum needed to win Euro-seats in France.
LIKELY RESULT: Latest polls give the UDF-RPR list of the governing coalition
31-32 per cent. Socialists expected to do badly, with one poll putting
support as low as 13.5 per cent, which would be a disastrous start to Mr
Rocard's campaign for the presidency next year. The Communists and National
Front have polled around 7 and 10 per cent respectively.

Voting today. The Dutch campaign has been short, uneventful and completely
overshadowed by domestic political wrangling following general national
elections a few weeks ago.
The four main parties, united in their support for political and monetary
union, also agree on the need to extend EU control to areas like policing
and immigration.
On social issues, they divide along right-left lines, but differences have
also emerged on the environment. The Liberals want an eco-tax in Europe only
if the rest of the industrialised world follows suit, while the other
parties have indicated a readiness to take part in a 'unilateral' European
move.
LIKELY RESULT: An opinion poll this week indicates only the Christian
Democrats will suffer losses. It is forecast to take eight seats, down two;
Labour to remain at its 1989 level with eight seats. Sharp gains are
predicted for the two parties which scored well in the general election. The
left-of-centre D66 is seen jumping to five seats from one, while the
Liberals could double their score to six seats.

Voting Sunday. There is little enthusiasm for the election in Greece.
European issues are scarcely mentioned in candidates' speeches, beyond a
statutory mention of the Ecu17bn that Greece will get in EU assistance for
infrastructure projects over the next five years.
For the governing Panhellenic Socialist Movement, the election is the first
test of popularity since it regained power last October. For the
conservative opposition New Democracy, the poll is seen as a test for Mr
Miltiades Evert, a former mayor of Athens who took over the leadership after
the election defeat.
LIKELY RESULT: Pasok looks set to maintain a clear lead over ND, with the
nationalist Political Spring gaining ground at the expense of both main
parties. One poll this week put Pasok ahead with 41.1 per cent to 36.2 per
cent for ND, 7.6 per cent for Political Spring, 4.7 per cent for the Left
Alliance and 4.4 per cent for the Stalinist Greek Communist Party.

Voting Today. Domestic issues such as unemployment and taxes have tended to
dominate the campaign, but the Fianna Fail-Labour coalition seems unlikely
to suffer from a protest vote.
Apart from Democratic Left, which is the most Euro-sceptic party fighting
the election, the main parties agree on the need for monetary union. Labour
and Fianna Fail, the centre-right party led by Mr Albert Reynolds, prime
minister, also place great emphasis on the need for strong EU social and
employment policies.
The opposition Fine Gael and Progressive Democrats have tried to discredit
the coalition over a controversial passports-for-investments scheme.
LIKELY RESULT: Fianna Fail, topping the polls in all four constituencies, is
set to win seven of the 15 seats, one more than 1989. Fine Gael is
struggling to keep its four and could lose one. Division in the Progressive
Democrats could result in it losing its only seat to an independent.

Voting Today. The Danish parties broadly oppose a federal Europe. Out of the
10 parties contesting the election, the opposition Liberal Party, set to win
four or five of Denmark's 16 seats in the parliament, is the only one in
favour. The party's annual conference in March backed a two-chamber system
of government for Europe, giving the European parliament legislative powers.
All the Danish parties support the social chapter. The Social Democrats,
heading the four-party coalition, goes furthest, advocating supranational
regulations to protect workers and prevent social dumping.
On monetary union, Denmark obtained a special opt-out in 1992. The
opposition Liberals and Conservatives favour eventual Danish participation
in monetary union, but the issue has not played a role in the campaign.
Danish membership would in any event require approval by a referendum.
LIKELY RESULT: The Social Democrats and the Liberals both stand to win 24
per cent, according to a Gallup poll this week. The anti-European alliance
of the June Movement and the People's Movement Against the EU may win 18 per
cent. The Conservatives would gain 12 per cent.

Voting Sunday. In a lacklustre campaign that has done little to provoke
controversy, the three main political groupings in Belgium have presented a
virtually united face on the need for monetary and political union and a
social chapter.
For Belgium's Christian Democrats, Socialists and Liberals, the desirability
of a single currency is not in doubt. In a country where people put region
before country, the Belgian franc inspires no great affection.
Even the Liberals who allegedly favour Thatcherite economics believe a
social chapter is important to raise the living standards of Europe's poorer
workers.
On integration all again are in favour although the nuances differ according
to the cultural divide. Flemish voters, of whatever, have a very precise
idea of how an integrated, federalist Europe should be structured. They
favour one in which regions are more important than nation states, a notion
less enthusiastically endorsed by the Francophone Walloons.
LIKELY RESULT: Liberals expected to gain 25 per cent of vote, ahead of
Christian Democrats and Socialists, with between 21 and 22 per cent,
according to latest polls.

Voting Sunday. On the issues of political and economic union, the main
German government and opposition parties share many views. They favour
strengthening European institutions, including giving more power to the
European parliament to counter-balance the council of ministers. They want
to reinforce common foreign and security policy, and more common action on
crime-fighting and immigration.
All agree on the need for eventual enlargement to bring the democracies of
central and eastern Europe into the EU. However, the opposition Social
Democrats say this can only happen after further reform within the Union -
not least to bring agricultural spending under control. They argue for
'deepening' before further 'widening' of the EU.
On monetary union, the parties say the economic convergence criteria are
more important than the precise timetable.
On social policy, the differences are clearest. The SPD favours Europe-wide
social standards. The Christian Democrats stand for minimum standards of
protection, without excessive regulation. The Free Democrats tend towards
deregulation to improve labour market flexibility.
LIKELY RESULT: The latest opinion poll, published by Focus magazine, shows
the SPD and CDU neck-and-neck on 38.5 per cent, with the FDP failing to make
the 5 per cent needed for seats in the parliament.

integration, with no clear division over European policies but with
differences of emphasis. The governing Socialist party and conservative
Popular party support economic and monetary union. Both want a stronger
European parliament. Socialists put more emphasis on employment, the PP on

On EU foreign policy, both want more co-operation in the Mediterranean and

Voting today. Over monetary union, the governing Conservatives say the UK
parliament should have the right to decide on a single currency. Opposition
Labour is more compliant, saying exchange rates should be fixed after
economic convergence. Liberal Democrats support moves to a single currency
'in step' with other states.
On political union, the Conservatives insist the EU cannot supersede
nations, and Britain's veto must be retained on issues of vital national
interest. Labour is committed to an integrated and co-operative Europe, with
veto retained on defence, fiscal, foreign and constitutional matters.
The Liberal Democrats are for a democratic, decentralised, federal Europe.
They support a significant extension of qualified majority voting but with
national veto retained over monetary and defence decisions by the council of
ministers.
The social chapter is opposed by the Conservatives and backed by Labour. The
Liberal Democrats support it on balance, but are opposed to 35-hour week
'straitjacket'.
LIKELY RESULT: Conservatives likely to win less than 30 per cent of vote,
with sharp fall in seats from 32 in 1989 magnified by majority voting
system. Labour could take 50 or more; Liberal Democrats up to 12.

FT  09 JUN 94 / Britain ruled in breach of EU employment law: Companies must
consult workforces about changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE and DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British employers will, for the first time, face a statutory obligation to
consult employees when planning to make more than 10 redundancies or when
transferring workers from one business to another, after two rulings by the
European Court of Justice.
The rulings, which said Britain was in breach of EU laws protecting workers'
rights during the contracting out of public services, also pave the way for
compensation claims by employees over dismissal and loss of benefits.
The decision by the Luxembourg court means that companies - even
non-unionised ones - will have to ensure there is adequate machinery for
consulting their workforces. This could range from setting up committees
elected by employees to simply notifying workers in advance of changes.
Mr Fraser Younson, vice-president of the Employment Lawyers Association,
said: 'This is the most important development in UK industrial relations in
the past 20 years,'
The Luxembourg court said the UK had failed to implement key aspects of the
European acquired rights (1977) and collective redundancies (1975)
directives.
In translating the European rules into English law through the 1981 Transfer
of Undertakings (Protection of Employment ) Regulations, known as Tupe, the
UK limited the requirement to inform and consult workers to those employers
who recognised trade unions.
The judgment, which was not unexpected, was played down by the government as
a 'technicality'. Mr Michael Forsyth, employment minister, said the vast
majority of employers already had mechanisms for consulting with employees.
But the ruling was welcomed by trade unionists and Labour politicians.
Mr John Monks, Trades Union Congress general secretary, said: 'The right of
workers to be consulted over redundancies and transfers is a key element of
social policy which had been deliberately denied to British workers.'
The government is expected to introduce the required changes to legislation
in the next few months.
The European court also confirmed that the UK was guilty of excluding the
public sector from the job security and wage protection provided to workers
by Tupe. Last summer, the government fell into line with the rest of Europe
by extending Tupe to cover the public sector. However, yesterday's ruling
confirms the right of public sector employees who had not been covered by
the legislation to sue the government for compensation.

FT  09 JUN 94 / Lloyds bid for C&amp;G halted by High Court ruling: Society may
appeal against judgment on structure of bank offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER and JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The structure of Lloyds Bank's Pounds 1.8bn cash bid for Cheltenham and
Gloucester Building Society was ruled illegal last night by the High Court,
placing a large obstacle in the way of banks taking over building societies.
Mr Andrew Longhurst, C&amp;G's chief executive, said the society intended either
to appeal against the judgment, or try to find a way of restructuring the
offer to its members in a way that would bring it within the law.
Sir Donald Nicholls, the vice-chancellor, ruled that Lloyds could not pay
the C&amp;G investors who had been shareholders for less than two years. That
would make it extremely hard for C&amp;G to meet voting requirements for
approval of the takeover.
Mr Philip Lawson, Lloyds' chief legal adviser, described the judgment as 'a
hurdle to be overcome'. Lloyds said its bid still stood, and C&amp;G was free to
restructure the way in which it divided the cash between its members.
The judgment, which was announced after the stock market closed last night,
means that Lloyds' strategy for expanding its share of the retail financial
services market has suffered a setback.
The judgment affirms the section of the 1986 Building Societies Act intended
to stop 'speculative flows' of deposits between societies if a rumour spread
that a society was about to receive a bid from a third party.
C&amp;G is required by law to gain the approval of 75 per cent of its 825,000
shareholders for any takeover. As 27 per cent of shareholders have been with
the building society for less than two years, and so cannot be paid, it
faces difficulty in restructuring the deal.
Mr Longhurst said the society's advisers would examine the ruling to see 'if
we can modify the offer in some way to bring it within the terms of the
judgment'. He said the benefits of the offer remained clear in spite of the
ruling.
He said that although the society could simply offer money to shareholders
of more than two years' standing, 'that would mean that a lot of people who
have looked forward to getting some money would be disappointed'. Mr John
Wriglesworth, building societies analyst at UBS, said the ruling was 'a
temporary setback'. He said the society could replace the cash offer with
one of shares similar to Abbey National's flotation in 1989.
Because of the significance of the issues for all banks and societies, it is
widely expected that the matter might have to go to the House of Lords.
That might threaten the timetable already laid out for the Lloyds' takeover.
Some societies are likely to be relieved that the ruling reduces the
possibility of banks' putting pressure on them toplace other offers before
members.
However, Mr Derek Roberts, chief executive of Yorkshire Building Society,
said the ruling appeared to 'scupper one interesting option for the
restructuring of the mortgage market', which he believed was inevitable in
some form.

FT  09 JUN 94 / Hewlett Packard in chips link with Intel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Intel, the world's biggest semiconductor manufacturer, is to collaborate
with Hewlett-Packard, the second largest US computer company after IBM, to
develop a new generation of very powerful microprocessors.
The research and development partnership is aimed at creating microprocessor
chips to be the 'brains' of 21st-century computers, the companies said.
The chips will combine Intel's technology, which is at the heart of most
personal computers, with HP's reduced instruction set computing technology,
called PA-Risc - an advanced type of microprocessor that HP has pioneered as
the base for a broad range of computers, from desktop workstations to
mainframes.
The joint research and development project will include the design of 64-bit
microprocessors, advanced semiconductor processes and software. The
companies expect to spend several hundred million dollars on the effort and
to deliver the first jointly developed chips in the late 1990s.
The new chips will be able to run existing personal computer and Unix
software without modification, said Mr Richard Sevcik, HP group general
manager. In addition, the 64-bit design will be well suited to future
applications such as multimedia and three-dimensional graphics.
By combining the speed and power of HP's Risc technology with Intel's
high-volume manufacturing capabilities and the established software bases of
both, Intel and HP's collaboration may reinforce the companies' strong
market positions, analysts said.
The outcome, however, will depend upon the ability of the companies to
co-operate. HP and Intel are two of the most successful and established
companies in Silicon Valley. However, they have different cultures and
little history of joint projects.
The partnership mirrors the microprocessor alliance formed in 1991 by IBM,
Apple Computer and Motorola to develop PowerPC microprocessors, upon which
Apple has based its latest Macintosh computersand which IBM plans to use in
a broad range of products.
PowerPC as well as Risc microprocessors from Digital Equipment and Sun
Microsystems represent a challenge to Intel's domination of the
microprocessor market. The partnership with HP is seen as Intel's move to
address that.
Competitors noted that Intel and HP do not expect to see finite results from
their partnership until the end of the decade.
'We have a six-year lead on them,' said Willie Shih, vice-president of
Digital Equipment, 'but we welcome the news that Intel and HP are endorsing
our technology direction.' Digital has sold Dollars 1bn worth of computers
based on its 64-bit Alpha microprocessor, he noted.

FT  09 JUN 94 / Fed chief sees need for self-regulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Banks and other financial institutions will increasingly have to
self-regulate their trading activities because of the growing complexity of
financial markets, Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the US Federal Reserve
Board, said yesterday.
Mr Greenspan, who spoke after addressing the International Monetary
Conference in London, said financial institutions would have to be
increasingly 'self-regulated, largely because government regulators cannot
do that job'.
He said the primary means of preventing a bank collapsing because of losses
was 'that individual institutions in their self-interest become
extraordinarily knowledgeable about the counterparties with whom they are
dealing'.
His remarks indicate that regulators will in future place more stress on the
skills of individuals and sophistication of technology in financial
institutions, rather than insisting on examining their assets and
liabilities in detail.
Mr Greenspan said that central banks would gradually move from the direct
supervision of banks' credit risk towards monitoring their internal
processes and risk management systems.
He was supported by other international central bankers in casting doubt on
central banks' ability to contain volatility in bond and other financial
markets by imposing further regulations.
Mr Greenspan said that financial institutions would also have to 'create
risk management systems that can take very considerable shocks'. There was
'no fundamental alternative' to financial supervision moving towards this
model.
His remarks follow an indication that supervisors may allow banks to use
internal models to calculate what capital to hold against trading risks,
rather than using a model devised by the Basle committee of international
bank supervisors.
Mr Greenspan also said that an integration of the views and policies of
banking and securities regulators was 'inevitable' in spite of current
disagreements on capital requirements for market risks between supervisors
of the two industries.
He said that it was 'very difficult to make a judgment' about whether
central banks would intervene to support an investment bank or other
financial institution in a crisis.

FT  09 JUN 94 / Sharp rise in output increases hopes of recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT and PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Tory party was given a boost ahead of today's European elections as
sharp rises in industrial production and factory output in April raised
hopes that the UK recovery was gaining strength.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor, said the production figures were 'the best
news on the economy so far this year. Growth is stronger and spread wider'.
His upbeat assessment, which was echoed yesterday by the Treasury's monthly
monetary report, suggests that the recent downward trend in UK interest
rates has ended.
The report was issued as Mr Clarke met Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank
of England, for their monthly monetary talks. Although the details of the
meeting are not released for six weeks, the Treasury report, coupled with
the production figures, left most City analysts convinced that the
authorities are unlikely to change the base rates from their present level
of 5 1/4 per cent.
UK money markets currently assume that the Bank will raise interest rates to
about 6 per cent by the end of the year as stronger growth fuels
inflationary pressures. However, the Treasury report hinted that the
chancellor was unlikely to endorse any attempt by the Bank to push rates up
in the short term.
Although the report does not provide policy prescriptions, it noted that
inflation was at its lowest level in April since 1967. It also pointed out
that in spite of the recent rise in average earnings, wage settlements
remained broadly unchanged.
The report's upbeat presentation of the UK recovery suggested little need
for a fiscal stimulus in spite of recent tax rises. 'The latest monthly
indicators (are) consistent with continuing recovery.'
April's figures for industrial production and manufacturing output appeared
to underline the strength of the UK economic recovery. Seasonally adjusted,
the indicators showed month-on-month rises of 1.6 per cent and 1.1 per cent
respectively.
That was well above market expectations, which had centred on a rise of
about 0.5 per cent for production and output.
While the figures were boosted by some one-off factors, such as a fuel
output, there were signs of strength in such key industries as engineering.
April's oil and gas output passed the previous monthly record, set in May
1987.
Analysts were encouraged by the breakdown of the figures, showing production
of investment goods growing faster than that of consumer goods. In the past,
consumer-led UK recoveries have quickly led to balance-of-payment
constraints.

FT  09 JUN 94 / Arts: Controlled spleen - Cinema
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THREE COLOURS WHITE (15) Krzysztof Kieslowski
SERIAL MOM (18) John Waters
THE CROW (18) Alex Proyas
LONDON (U) Patrick Keiller
IN CUSTODY (U)Ismael Merchant
Watching Krzysztof Kieslowski's Three Colours White, I kept thinking of the
title of that book by Ayn Rand: Atlas Shrugged. For years this Polish
film-maker has borne the hopes of European cinema on his lone shoulders,
each film more of a grand tragicomic shrug than the last. He now tells us -
biggest shrug of all - that he is retiring from movie-making altogether. Is
European film prepared for free fall?
Perhaps the signs are already here in White. Like Blue before it and Red to
come, the film is a strip torn from the French tricouleur flag. This time
the theme embroidered is 'egalite'.
The dumpy hairdresser from Warsaw, Karol (Zbiegniew Zamachowski), so loves
the French girl he married six months before that he keeps flashbacking to
that orgasmic flutter of wedding veil and white dress in a Paris church.
Alas] That was the couple's only consummation to date. Unmanned by that
well-known disease 'emigrant stress' - the inability to function in another
country - Karol sits by, impotent in all senses, as pretty, spiteful
Dominique (Julie Delpy) first obtains a divorce and then burns down their
hairdressing shop.
Kieslowski and regular co-writer Krzysztof Piesiewicz shape what follows as
a kind of berserk little-man-makes-good tale. Karol returns to Poland to
rebuild his life and fortune - in shady real estate deals  - after first
faking death and assuming a new identity. Once rehabilitated, can he lure
Dominique back to his arms?
My own arms were tugged near to dislocation by opposing demons. The nice
demon said: This is a sour, clever, funny satire on the new capitalist
spirit in Eastern Europe, a place where everything can be bought, from fake
passports to dead bodies. The nasty demon, pulling my other arm, said: This
film is intellectually and dramatically slight, at least by the high
standards Mr K himself has set.
I must agree with both demons. White is a master-class in controlled spleen
and social-psychological irony compared with most modern European films. But
Kieslowski has set our hopes of him too high. The trilogy's first film Blue
had a passion of sound, texture and image that bordered on the miraculous.
Surrounded by an Expressionist force field, the film's protagonist (Juliette
Binoche, who makes a fleeting guest appearance in White) seemed gripped by
anxieties we all recognised even when her beautifully gnomic face seemed to
say nothing.
White changes mood, changes structure - more linear-anecdotal - and most
crucially changes cameraman. Edward Klosinski is not a colour-filter freak
like Slawomir Idziak (Blue, Red, The Double Life Of Veronique). The
near-monochrome wash of his images suits the sly, downbeat comedy of White.
But that downbeat comedy, shorn of stylistic flourishes, does not suit a
feature film. White would have made a good short story in the Decalogue
series. Even its ending, where 'equality' between the sexes is delivered
with a clinching sour-sweet irony, seems more suited to the punchline
technique of short story closures than to the sense of echoing questions
with which a feature film - above all, a Kieslowski feature film - should
leave us.
Serial Mom is the latest American movie about the corruption lying beneath
the smiling face of suburbia. How the nation's film-makers are obsessed with
this] If you laid Mom's writer-director John Waters (Mondo Trasho, Female
Troubles, Hairspray) end to end with David Lynch, Penelope Spheeris, Joe
Dante and the rest of the 'burb-bashers, you could walk over them all the
way from Baltimore, Mom's setting and Waters' home town, to that greatest of
all jumped-up suburbs, Hollywood.
Kathleen Turner flexes a mean pair of dimples as Beverly Sutphen,
housewife-superkiller. She runs over a teacher. She skewers her daughter's
jilting boyfriend (look away when his palpitating liver emerges on the end
of her weapon). And raiding the fridge, she brings a lamb to the slaughter
of a woman neighbour who refuses to rewind her videos.
But the main murder victim is the film, done in by its own vacillations
between dainty spoofery and bad-taste excess. The killing sprees belong to a
different movie from the Ideal Home satire ruling elsewhere. In this
heroine's house the furniture, wallpaper and dialogue are all in matching
tones and the reactionary family-values pieties are also wittily in place.
Best of all is the yet-unsuspected Beverly's show of chagrin over Our Lord's
refusal to commit himself about capital punishment, even on the cross. 'If
ever there was a time to go on record about the death penalty . . .'
Say what you like about The Crow, it has a consistent style: MTV Gothic.
Pour in that chiaroscuro; jump around with that camera; growl out that
music, not so much heavy metal, more scrapyard noises from hell.
But an irony sits, like the title bird, at the centre of this tale of a rock
star back from the grave to avenge his own murder. On screen Brandon Lee's
chalk-faced hero spends scene after scene bouncing back after being hit by
real bullets. Off screen the star, son of the also prematurely-departed
Bruce, died from what should have been a fake bullet; but the gun had a
fragment of metal still lodged in its barrel. Lee was rushed to hospital;
and soon after that, he was being rushed into hoped-for legend.
The film will make no one immortal. Set in a nameless inner city on
Halloween night, it looks like Delicatessen crossed with The Munsters.
Events veer between the banal and the incomprehensible. And with Lee's role
padded out with stunt double shots and hide-and-seek shadow play, Michael
Wincott's gravel-voiced smoothie of a villain walks into the clear patches
of light and steals the film.
I wish someone had stolen Patrick Keiller's London. This feature-length
essay on the city is diffidently tweaked towards fiction by a narrator's
overvoice. While the static images click past like a lantern slide lecture -
the famous buildings, rotting factories, glinting riverways - Paul
Scofield's nameless 'I' describes a series of exploratory walks taken with
gay friend and omniscient London expert 'Robinson.'
The script has an appealing stock of comic ironies and literary allusions:
Rimbaud, Baudelaire, Defoe. But they are regularly rolled over by the film's
political agenda, caterpillar-treading through racism, Thatcherism,
homelessness and all the other too familiarly crushable targets of Nineties
enlightenment.
In Custody is better, but only just. The directing debut of producer Ismael
Merchant, its tale of an ageing Urdu poet (Shashi Kapoor) dealing with life,
age, wives and - worst of all - interviewers has some of the lapidary grace
of confrere James Ivory. I only wish it had some pace too. Like so many
post-Satyajit Ray Indian films it suffers from that ruthless syndrome:
subcontinental drift.

FT  08 JUN 94 / International Company News: Sprint warms up for race to link
world telecoms - The US group's planned alliance reflects a global trend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS and MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If it is consummated, the prospective tie-up between Sprint, the
third-largest US long-distance telecommunications carrier, and the state
telecoms operators of France and Germany will be the second of three grand
international telecoms alliances due to be formed by the end of the year.
It will also set the seal on the contract between France Telecom and
Deutsche Telekom signed last December, when the two European state-owned
companies announced an Ecu1bn (Dollars 666m) alliance to develop much of
their international networks business jointly.
The first alliance was announced last June, when British Telecommunications
undertook to buy 20 per cent of MCI, the second-largest US long-distance
carrier, and form a joint venture with it geared to the international
business market. BT laid out Dollars 5.3bn - Dollars 1bn for the joint
venture and the rest for the stake.
'That put the pressure on the rest of us with global pretensions to move
fast,' says a senior Deutsche Telekom executive. That meant, in particular,
the French and German operators, the US giant AT&amp;T, Sprint, and Unisource -
a joint venture between the Swedish, Dutch and Swiss state operators with
Telefonica of Spain in loose association.
France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom, which is headed by Helmut Ricke, were
already linked in a joint venture called Eunetcom, geared like Unisource to
the market for 'outsourcing' the telecoms needs of multinational companies.
Their decision to deepen the alliance surprised no-one. However, intensive
talks between the two and AT&amp;T caused widespread consternation, given that
it would involve a union of three of the world's four largest telecoms
operators, each of them from the monopoly stable.
Disputes over the structure of an alliance, and fears about regulatory
approval - the Franco-German link has still to be approved by the European
Commission - appear to have scuppered the talks.
AT&amp;T has since been in negotiations with Unisource: this has already led to
co-operation between the two to win Europe's largest telecoms outsourcing
contract. And analysts believe it could proceed further.
That tie-up left Sprint and the Franco-German partnership searching for
allies. However, it has taken more than the elimination of prospective
partners to bring them together - a strong business rationale underlines the
union, however difficult it may prove to be in practice.
The goal for all the companies engaged in the current matchmaking is simple:
as international telecoms are liberalised, to carve out a leading share in
the market they expect to develop for outsourcing the telecoms needs of
multinational companies.
There is room for scepticism about the value, even the existence, of the
market they are aiming at. According to Dataquest, the international
consultancy, the European market for corporate outsourcing is expected to
rise from Dollars 800m in 1993 to Dollars 1.7bn in 1996 - out of total
European spending of Dollars 186bn on telecoms services two years from now.
'It's only a tiny fraction of the total market they are going for,' says Ms
Kathy Burrows at Dataquest.
However, the large telecoms operators have convinced themselves that the
market will grow fast thereafter, and that a commanding position in it could
open up strategic opportunities.
To take advantage of them, each believes it needs to be in an alliance with
four factors: money; a presence in the US, Europe and Asia-Pacific; a benign
regulatory climate; and access to state-of-the-art network services.
The attraction of Sprint to France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom is its
reputation for technological innovation, its international data network and
its US operations. Its network extends to all three important sectors of the
US market: long distance and international, local telephone and cellular
wireless services. Given its small share of the US long-distance market (10
per cent against AT&amp;T's 65 per cent), it is also unlikely to alarm
regulators on either side of the Atlantic.
Sprint already has a sizeable international presence of its own, with sales
offices and joint ventures in 34 countries and territories, and a stake in
global fibre optic links. It is best-known internationally for SprintNet,
one of the world's leading data networks, linking computers in nearly 100
cities and 32 countries.
SprintNet is used for sophisticated corporate data information flows, such
as bank transfer of funds or order processing and inventory tracking by
multinational manufacturing companies. The group's SprintMail service also
claims a substantial share of the international E-mail market.
Sprint needs capital to expand. And to be a respectable operator in the
international outsourcing market, it needs a weighty European partner.
An alliance with the French and German operators offers the prospect of
both.
But even if an alliance is announced, there are plenty of potential
obstacles. Not the least of them is the severe difficulties being
experienced by France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom in their efforts to
restructure in order to face up to competition within Europe.
The privatisation of the German operator appears to have run into trouble:
and so afraid is the French government of the backlash from France Telecom's
employees, it will not even start the process.

The German government appears to be considering corporate tax cuts in
response to pleas from industry. A working on local authority taxes group
comprising federal and local government officials had identified levies on
working capital and operating profits as special burdens on industry, Mr
Franz-Christoph Zeitler, state secretary in the finance ministry said
yesterday. However, he rejected as 'false' press reports that Bonn planned
to increase value added tax to cover the loss of revenue. Mr Zeitler was
responding to a story in Stern magazine, quoting from what it claims to be
secret ministry minutes, that the government wanted to 'clarify in principle
the possibility of reforming corporate taxes.'

<TEXT>
The leaders of Bosnia's warring sides yesterday congregated in Geneva for a
second day of talks on a proposed ceasefire but did not meet face to face
promising little hope of an agreement. After separate meetings with the
rival leaders, Mr Yasushi Akashi, top UN official in former Yugoslavia, said
the talks would be adjourned for a later date unless the main protagonists
made a 'real effort' towards an agreement. As both sides quarreled over how
long the proposed truce should last, fighting was reported between Serb and
government forces in northern Bosnia.
In Serbia, in a thinly-veiled attack on Bosnian Serb leaders, President
Zoran Lilic of Yugoslavia, technically head of the Yugoslav federation but
seen as a puppet of Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, yesterday said his
country will not be 'dragged into war' and that 'millions of Yugoslav
citizens' in Serb-held areas in Bosnia 'cannot be hostage to one leader'.

<TEXT>
Unions at Air Inter, the main domestic carrier in the Air France group,
yesterday called their second 24-hour strike in three weeks in protest at
the lack of 'concrete' assurances at their pay and job security will not
suffer as a result of new austerity measures for Air France. But the strike,
called also to press Air Inter's case for more autonomy within the Air
France group, was less widespread than the first one, halting about 50 per
cent of flights yesterday. Meanwhile, the French government has warned the
European Commission that if Brussels stops it injecting FFr20bn into Air
France and thereby forces the airline into liquidation, the total cost to
the French taxpayer would be even greater, amounting to FFr30bn. This was
revealed by the Commission in its formal nouncement last Friday of an
inquiry into the Air France deal, which Brussels said in view of the
airline's debts and losses could not be equated with the 'rational' decision
of a private investor.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
West European governments lost at least Dollars 200m (Pounds 133m) in 1993
through VAT avoidance because of computer software piracy, according to
figures published this week, writes Alan Cane. Their losses were small,
however, compared with those of the major software companies who
conservatively lost a total Dollars 737m according to the Software
Publishers Association, with a further Dollars 436m lost by software
distributors and retailers. The total loss of Dollars 1.3bn comes close to
equalling the Dollars 1.6bn of software sold legitimately by software
publishers in western Europe last year.
The SPA comprises most of the world's major software houses, principally
US-owned, including Microsoft, Lotus and Apple. It has been campaigning
vigorously against counterfeiters, securing court orders to enter offices
and confiscate suspect disks and computers.

The European Union said South Africa would be admitted to the generalised

including a formal trade treaty, were likely to follow soon afterwards,
writes Mark Suzman in Johannesburg.
Earlier this week Mr Erwan Fouere, the European ambassador, said he expected
South Africa to be added to the GSP, a concept developed by the UN
Conference on Trade and Development.
Under it developing nations are granted virtually tariff-free access to the
European market for manufactured and semi-manufactured goods, within the
next month.
EU foreign ministers agreed in principle to the move in April but waited
until after the elections to formalise it.
Mr Fouere also said that the EU had already made representations to the new
South African government on a future trade agreement and he expected a final
deal to be reached relatively quickly.

FT  08 JUN 94 / Pakistanis warned of sacrifices: A look at the background to
tomorrow's budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FARHAN BOKHARI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Government leaders including the prime minister, Ms Benazir Bhutto, have
warned Pakistanis to be prepared to make sacrifices, for the sake of
long-term growth, when the annual budget is unveiled tomorrow.
The budget, for the fiscal year beginning on July 1, follows economic growth
of about 4 per cent, up from 3 per cent the previous year but below the
target of 7.4 per cent. Official estimates show the inflation rate at 10.5
per cent, again an improvement on the 11 per cent of the previous year but
above the government's target of 8 per cent.
Exports and imports have both fallen and the agriculture sector, which makes
the largest contribution to the economy has grown by only 2.6 per cent,
largely because of the destruction of more than a third of this year's
cotton crop by a virus.
However, there are some brighter spots. The government claims that this
would be the first year in almost a decade that the budget deficit would
remain within its target, in this case 5.4 per cent of gross domestic
product, following several years of rampant fiscal indiscipline. This
compares with nearly 8 per cent in the previous year.
Foreign exchange reserves have risen to almost Dollars 2bn from last
summer's low of below Dollars 300m.
Independent economists say improvements in the budget deficit and the
reserves are important positive factors for international financial
institutions. Earlier this year, Islamabad signed loans worth Dollars 1.36bn
with the International Monetary Fund and agreed to accept conditions
including lower bank borrowings by the government, improvement in reserves
and a lower deficit.
'Our key priority is to attain macroeconomic stability. We consider it a
prerequisite for future growth,' says Mr VA Jafarey, the prime minister's
adviser on finance, who is de facto finance minister. 'We consider that
previous attempts at accelerating growth failed because macroeconomic
stability was not ensured.'
Among planned measures are a widening of the scope of the existing general
sales tax in order to boost revenues. The government's intention to lower
tariffs over the next three years is forcing the country to wean itself from
reliance on duties on exports and imports. 'We have to find ways to tax
consumers and also encourage industrial growth as well as trade,' says a
senior official.
Some businesses have already begun opposing the move, arguing that with a
large black economy and smuggling flourishing, only legitimate businesses
would be hit hard by the sales tax which would mean higher prices at retail
outlets.
Last year, a parliamentary committee found that up to Rs100bn (Dollars
3.34bn) worth of smuggling takes place each year. In addition, some
businesses argue that with large scale corruption in the tax department, the
new tax would provide further opportunities for bribery.
Mr Tahir Khaliq, a businessman and former president of the Karachi Chamber
of Commerce and Industry, claims that items which are taxed end up being
sold at a price of up to 50 to 60 per cent higher than smuggled goods. 'If
the tax collector is not honest, people take advantage of that and misuse
the system,' he says.
Mr Haroon Rashid, president of the KCCI, wants the 'unorganised sector'  - a
reference to the black and informal economy, to be taxed like other
businesses so that the sales tax would be considered to be fair.
Other issues related to the country's macroeconomic structure are also being
debated. Almost two-thirds of the budget goes towards debt servicing and
funding the defence forces. The recent decision by India, Pakistan's arch
enemy, to raise its defence budget by up to 20 per cent has put added
pressure on the government of Ms Bhutto to look closely at the country's
defence needs. However Ms Bhutto said this week that Pakistan would not try
to match the Indian defence budget increase.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Dalai Lama, concerned about mounting pressure on him to abandon a policy
of non-violence towards Beijing, appealed to the west yesterday to try to
influence China about the future of Tibet, Reuter reports from Brussels.
Addressing Belgian MPs during a three-day visit to Belgium, the exiled
Tibetan spiritual leader said he had failed so far to get anywhere with
China.
'In Tibet some people think we should use more violent means. This (view)
may even be growing, but I do not think this is the right approach,' the
1989 Nobel Peace Prize winner said. 'I want you to use all of your influence
to make sure that the Chinese government accepts negotiations with the
Tibetans,' he said.
The Dalai Lama has sought talks with Beijing since 1979 when paramount
Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping said that 'except for the independence of
Tibet, all other questions can be negotiated'. He has proposed that Tibet be
given internal autonomy with China looking after foreign policy and defence.
The Dalai Lama told the MPs he would like to hold a referendum to find out
if non-violence still had support among his followers.
The Dalai Lama said he was not interested in entering politics in Tibet,
pointing out that many Tibetans would have problems accepting a religious
leader as a politician.

FT  08 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Share prices struggle in thin trading
volumes - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The London stock market had to struggle to hold on to the Footsie 3,000 mark
at the close of trading yesterday after renewed weakness in British
government bonds undermined equities. Trading volume remained poor, matching
Monday's retail business total of Pounds 764.1m, which was among the lowest
genuine daily totals for the past 12 months.
Low volume again brought volatility in a market in which many fund managers
appeared to have backed off until next week, when the elections to the
European parliament will be out of the way. Uncertainty is focused in London
because of the likelihood that Thursday's poll will deal a further blow to
the political standing of Mr John Major's governing Conservative party.
The FT-SE 100 Index finished 4.6 down at 3,004.8, but had traded between
3,014 and 2,993 during the session. Across the wider range of stocks, the
FT-SE Mid 250 Index closed at 3,577.6 for a net gain of 6.2. Seaq volume of
482.9m shares compared with 436.4m in the previous session.
Although economic news came mostly in other securities markets, equities in
London continued to move under the influence of bond prices. Unsubstantiated
rumours of further corporate problems in Germany helped to unsettle the
markets, and widespread falls in UK gilts kept share prices under restraint.
At Panmure Gordon, Mr Robin Aspinall warned that the decoupling of European
bonds from the US may serve to emphasise the sale of overhanging positions
built up when investors were playing between transatlantic markets. London
markets turned cautious yesterday afternoon when investors were waiting for
the US consumer credit statistics.
After opening a shade easier, the stock market fell sharply within minutes
as government bonds began to ease. The Footsie 3,000 mark was lost but only
briefly. By mid-morning the index had rebounded to what was to prove the
day's high of 3,014.8.
Chart analysts were relieved to see the Footsie 3,000 level held since any
loss would again leave the market struggling to find a new foothold. But the
poor trading volumes in the market undermined the credibility of the rally.
The final picture showed a somewhat mixed performance by blue chips. One of
the strongest areas was the regional electricity generating companies, which
moved up as the market assessed prospects for the National Grid that belongs
to the 12 regional companies.
Bank and financial shares were largely unable to extend the recovery of the
previous session. Consumer stocks struggled to throw off the market's
continued doubts over the outlook for consumer spending, with only a handful
of food retailers finding support.
Unilever, however, bounced significantly in the second half of the session
on news that a Dutch supermarket would continue to stock the new detergent
product which has attracted public attack from its principal rival.
Worries in the retail sector were taken up by analysts at Robert Fleming,
who maintained that the sector will 'lose momentum' this year, dragging down
GDP performance in its wake. Fleming believes that neither recovery in
investment nor stockbuilding will prove sufficient to replace what it
identifies as missing personal consumption.

FT  08 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Bank leads
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, CHRISTINE BUCKLEY and CLARE GASCOIGNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Banking group Standard Chartered was the FT-SE 100's best individual
performer for the second consecutive session, the shares following Monday's
12p rise with a further gain of 10 at 262p after renewed aggressive buying
from Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank.
Morgan Stanley recently published a strong buy recommendation on the stock,
emphasising the bank's 'very good long-term prospects, cost-cutting ability
and dividend growth potential'.
Mr Nick Collier, banks specialist at Morgan Stanley, said Standard shares
had come down from the equivalent of 358p and that he had emphasised the
selling had been overdone. 'The rerating of Standard has only just begun,'
he added.
A buy recommendation from Yamaichi helped J. Sainsbury buck the general
trend and rise 3 to 384p.
The broker highlighted a stronger than anticipated recovery in sales and the
impact of subsidiaries - such as Homebase and US retailer Shaw's - as major
factors in the recovery, and believes the 'Essential for Essentials'
campaign, launched last October, has been successful enough to put strong
pressure on other retailers.
'If Sainsbury and the other majors can contain the discounters and if cost
reductions can be implemented, then it is possible to forecast some recovery
in profit levels for some parts of the industry,' it said.
Yamaichi is forecasting Pounds 787m pre-tax profits for the current year and
Pounds 847m for 1996.
Strong sentiment pushed RTZ ahead with a buy note from Kleinwort Benson and
an upgrade of this year's estimates from Lehman Brothers helping the shares
post an increase of 13 to 833p.
Lehman boosted its earnings per share forecast from 37.6p to 40.8p for this
year on the back of a substantial upward revision of the copper price by the
broker. It raised its estimate for the average copper price for 1994 from 78
cents/lb to 92 cents/lb, citing a combination of high demand in the US and
strong investment interest. Turnover reached 2m.
Unilever bounced back from yesterday's 22p fall, gaining 13 to close at
988p. Sentiment recovered after this morning's statement from Dutch retailer
Ahold that it would continue to stock the Unilever washing powder which
rival Procter &amp; Gamble has alleged ruins clothes.
Kleinwort Benson moved from hold to buy; Richard Allen said the worst
possible case was a one-off write-off of about 3 per cent of market
capitalisation, about Pounds 250,000 - even on that basis, the stock was
undervalued 'and that is not our central case,' he added. 'Remember over 50
per cent of Unilever's business is in sectors that are growing as well as if
not better than the market. The shares represent good value at this level.'
Enterprise Oil slipped 9 to 379p, with the shares increasingly weakened by
fears that a robust defence document which has to be made by the end of this
week from bid target Lasmo, could bring a higher offer from Enterprise.
Lasmo shares were again upset by selling from speculators who bought the
shares ahead of the much-rumoured bid, closing 5 1/2 off at 135 1/2p.
Amersham shares surged 33 to 871p in the wake of excellent preliminary
results which showed pre-tax profits up over 65 per cent and the dividend
total up 15 per cent.
The good figures and news of a proposed one-for-one scrip issue saw Allied
Colloids advance 11 to 260p.
Heavy turnover of 5.7m in brewer Bass was prompted by a change from hold to
buy by Kleinwort Benson, but the stock eased a penny to 519p. Mr David
Thompson said the two concerns of big cash outflow and beer pricing had now
been factored into the price.
Results from Great Portland Estates disappointed the market this morning,
knocking 7 off the share price to close at 196p. A NAV of 209p per share
compared badly with expectations in the 225-230p range, and a cautious
statement on the prospects for rental growth did nothing to allay fears.
Continued benefit from its announcement of talks to take a stake in Fokker
and news of a Colombian contract buoyed British Aerospace, which added 9 at
468p with 1.3m shares traded. The stock was backed in buy notes from UBS,
Strauss Turnbull and NatWest.

FT  08 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: 'Recs' wanted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, CHRISTINE BUCKLEY and CLARE GASCOIGNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Better than expected results from the National Grid, owned by the regional
electricity companies, were behind the latest strong performance from the
'recs'.
The National Grid announced a 15 per cent increase in its dividend payment,
slightly disappointing the market's super-bulls, who had been looking for a
rise of around 18 per cent, but generally pleasing the market, where the
'recs' made good progress throughout the session.
Mr Kevin Lapwood, utilities analyst at Smith New Court, described the
National Grid results as 'extremely bullish for the recs'. The Smith analyst
said that in only one year since the Grid had its regulatory review - then
viewed as harsh by the market - the company has already managed a return on
capital of 8 per cent on the dividend and 15 per cent on earnings on the
back of a 10 per cent cut in manpower.
'If the recs can do the same after the current review, then you could be
looking at potential prices of 900p a share on average,' said Smith's Mr
Lapwood.
The best individual performances from the recs came from Eastern, 11 higher
at 590p, Northern, 10 up at 651p, and Southern, 10 firmer at 573p. Norweb,
622p, and South Wales, 627p, rose 7 apiece.

FT  08 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Switching activity in Hanson
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, CHRISTINE BUCKLEY and CLARE GASCOIGNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hanson warrants and ordinary shares figured prominently in the market's most
actively traded stocks, with the Seaq ticker revealing two exceptionally
heavy deals in the warrants and one big trade in the ordinary shares.
Turnover of 11m Hanson warrants was almost entirely due to two trades, each
of 5m warrants carried out at 32p apiece, while Hanson ordinary saw turnover
of 7.5m shares, with 3m accounted for by a single trade at 253 1/2p. Salomon
Brothers, the US brokerage, acknowledged that it had been heavily involved
in a switching operation. Hanson ordinary closed 3 3/4 off at 250 3/4p and
the warrants lost a penny at 31 1/2p.

FT  08 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Weakness in stock index futures was faced by a stubborn cash market that
refused to be led downwards, Christine Buckley writes.
One derivatives trader speculated that a buy programme may have shored up
the cash market, which has recently often fallen prey to the many swings of
the June contract on the FT-SE 100.
Directionless trading dogged June, with much of its fall over the session
attributed to ticking down by independent traders. Institutions were said to
have kept to the sidelines.
This week's lack of economic data is deepening the apathy. For most of the
day, June traded at a substantial discount to cash although in a fairly
narrow range. The contract fell to its lowest level early in the session
when it touched 2,983, although it rallied to reach its intraday high of
3,014 only a little later.
However, after mid-morning the contract found few friends and drifted, often
downwards, for much of the session, closing at 2,998 and trailing the cash
market by nearly 9 points. Volume was thin at 13,070 contracts.
Options had an uneventful day, with just 20,913 lots dealt. Index options
were a prominent part of the activity as investors looked for hedging
positions. The FT-SE 100 option traded 10,685 lots. The most traded stock
option was Guinness at 1,005.

FT  08 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow subsides as equities
follow bonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US stocks slipped yesterday in a quiet session influenced by declining bond
prices, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 12.61 lower at 3,755.91, while the
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 eased 0.67 to 458.21. In the
secondary markets, the American SE composite dipped 0.10 to 442.49 and the
Nasdaq composite receded 4.13 to 739.30.
With no fresh economic news on offer, activity was leis-urely. Only 234.7m
shares were exchanged on the New York SE. Analysts said trading would likely
remain listless until the Commerce Department released May producer prices
data on Friday. Consumer price figures are due next Monday.
The two reports are not expected to stir the market unless the data confound
expectations of tame inflation last month. Forecasts are centring on a 0.2
per cent increase in the PPI, after a slight decline in April. The CPI is
expected to show a 0.3 per cent upturn, after inching 0.1 per cent ahead in
the previous month.
After a welcome two-day rally, the US Treasury market was taking a breather.
The benchmark 30-year government bond was showing a modest loss by midday,
with traders also looking ahead to the inflation numbers.
In the absence of a strong movement by bonds or important fundamental
guidance, technical conditions came to the fore, giving rise to
profit-taking across the board.
Cyclical issues were the hardest hit, probably reflecting recent statistics
pointing to a cooling economy. Caterpillar dropped Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars
106 and Alcoa retreated Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 69 7/8 , but McDonald's
climbed Dollars 1 to Dollars 62 5/8 .
Electric utilities were among the most active issues, with much of the
trading linked to dividend payment schedules. Texas Utilities dipped Dollars
 1/4 to Dollars 32 1/2 on heavy volume of 2.5m shares. Long Island Lighting
softened Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 19 7/8 .
In pharmaceuticals, Rhone-Poulenc Rorer was turning in a strong performance
amid speculation that the French parent company might raise its stake in the
US operation.
Late last Friday the company had filed a document with the Securities and
Exchange Commission which increased the likelihood of such a move, analysts
said. After a delayed opening yesterday, its share price jumped Dollars 3
1/2 to Dollars 38 5/8 .
Alexander &amp; Alexander Services resumed trading after a one-day hiatus
requested by the company, pending a 'significant announcement' The stock
added Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 17 3/4 as the company revealed that American
International Group would invest Dollars 200m in a new issue of convertible
preferred stock. AIG advanced Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 95 1/4 .
It was a quiet day on the Nasdaq, with many technology stocks showing slight
declines. Wellfleet Communications shed Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 25 1/4 but
Lotus Development gained Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 57 3/8 . Microsoft marked
its first day as one of the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index stocks by slipping
Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 53 5/8 .
Canada
Toronto stocks declined broadly but finished off the session's lows after a
choppy session, and traders fear more volatility is on the cards.
An analyst said: 'There were two bright spots - real estate was up nearly
1.5 per cent and base metals was up a tick. But the rest of the market was
hiding under a bed somewhere.'
The TSE 300 composite index closed 16.9 down at 4,252.1, having initially
fallen to 4,232.4. Declines outscored advances by 454 to 273. Trading was
brisk, volume reaching 91.9m shares valued at CDollars 633.3m.
Newbridge Networks rose CDollars 1 3/4 to CDollars 54 1/2 awaiting the
release of its financial results for the year ended April 30.
Brazil
Shares in Sao Paulo were just 0.4 per cent higher at the close after late
profit-taking had eroded gains scored earlier in the session. Foreign and
domestic investors pushed stocks ahead at first as they continued to buy
ahead of the introduction of the new currency, the real, on July 1.
The Bovespa index of the 56 most active shares gained a net 118 points at
29,205. Turnover was Cr515bn (Dollars 256.2m).
A dealer said the market showed a tendency to remain nervous ahead of the
closing of the options settlement on June 20. It was also still waiting for
developments on government efforts to stabilise the economy, analysts added.

FT  08 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Frankfurt frightened by new
loan losses rumour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As equities wobbled around the world, Mr David Roche and his new firm,
Independent Strategy, offered encouragement yesterday to long term financial
asset markets, writes Our Markets Staff.
'The conditions are set for mild world economic recovery, no return of
inflation and lower bond yields in most countries,' said Mr Roche, marking
out German, US and Japanese equities and bonds for positive surprises. But
yesterday's German surprise was quite the reverse.
FRANKFURT was running along contentedly when the bottom fell out of the
market. The Dax index closed the session 27.97 lower at 2,135.10 and hit
2,123.67 in the post-bourse before ending at 2,131.80, down 1.5 per cent on
the day.
Share prices foundered on a rumour that major banks were at risk of more
heavy losses from a corporate borrower - perhaps, once again, in the real
estate sector. The banks denied it but Bayernhypo fell DM13, or 2.9 per
cent, to DM429.50 and Commerzbank DM12.50, or 3.7 per cent, to DM325.
Elsewhere, Daimler led the slide with a fall of DM12.50 to DM802; Siemens
lost DM13 at DM695.50; and, in a weak engineering sector, KHD and
Klockner-Werke fell DM4.60 to DM135.90 and DM5.50 to DM153.50 respectively.
Ms Barbara Altmann at B Metzler in Frankfurt said that the banking rumour
had a general effect on share prices. Noting that turnover stayed low
yesterday, rising from DM5.2bn to DM5.3bn, she added: 'With volume this low,
people can make money out of other people's fears.'
MILAN recovered 1.6 per cent as domestic and foreign investors returned to
buy blue chips. The Comit index regained 11.73 at 750.66as the market
awaited government measures, possibly today, to help the labour market.
Investors were further cheered by news that Italian equity funds continued
to record net receipts in May, confounding worries that the recent market
downturn might have indicated net redemptions during the month.
Fiat led the advance, adding L239, or 3.5 per cent, at L7,060 after comments
by Mr Giorgio Garuzzo, Fiat Auto president, that the group was struggling to
keep up with demand for the new Punto model. Olivetti put on L100 at L2,651
and Pirelli added L102 at L2,769.
Sip and Stet, foreign favourites, both rose by 4.1 per cent, by L181 to
L4,555 and by L221 to L5,582 respectively.
Against the trend, Credito Italiano fell L23 to L2,361 on news that it
planned to raise L2,000bn over five years through rights issues.
PARIS bounced back from the session's lows, helped by a technical recovery
late in the day in futures. The CAC-40 index finished 13.41 down at
2,023.74, in turnover of some FFr3bn.
Suez rose FFr2.60 to FFr308.50 as the market was swept by rumours that the
sale of its Groupe Victoire insurance subsidiary was imminent.
Rhone-Poulenc, FFr1.70 cheaper at FFr133.50, was also subject to unconfirmed
reports that it was to buy out the minority shareholding in Rhone-Poulenc
Rorer, a US subsidiary, in which it has a 68 per cent shareholding.
AMSTERDAM drifted lower in a session dominated by broad declines in blue
chip issues. The AEX index shed 2.07 to 405.28 as Royal Dutch dipped Fl 2.60
to Fl 196.80 on weakness in oil prices.
Nedlloyd drifted down Fl 1.40 at Fl 66.60 with James Capel reiterating its
sell recommendation. On the upside, KLM rose 40 cents to Fl 49.40 as the
airline reported a rise in passenger traffic during May.
ZURICH made an early attempt to add to Monday's rally, before renewed
profit-taking and a weak bond market pulled prices back. The SMI index ended
3.3 off at 2,778.1 after a morning peak of 2,798.
Roche certificates found Monday's strength short-lived, giving up SFr40 to
SFr6,840. Cyclicals were mixed: BBC lost SFr8 to SFr1,225 while Sulzer
registered put on SFr14 to SFr948 after a recommendation from Credit Suisse.
SMH lost SFr11 to SFr810 after the watchmaker said it expected only modest
profit growth this year but was confident about the outlook for its core
business.
MADRID was hit by last minute selling after a drop in the futures market,
and the general index fell 3.52 to 323.54 in turnover estimated at less than
Pta25bn.
ATHENS slipped nearly 2 per cent on profit-taking, with most of the losses
seen among construction stocks. The general index lost 17.3 to 854.54, in a
session extended by one hour following technical problems.
HELSINKI fell 1.2 per cent but two of its conglomerates fared worse.
Huhtamaki lost FM20, or 9.5 per cent at FM190 after its profits came out
higher, but far below analysts' expectations; and Amer shed FM3, or 2.2 per
cent to FM131 although it reported a 67 per cent rise in earnings per share
for the first four months of 1994. The Hex index closed 21.4 lower at
1,754.6.
WARSAW dropped back for the third consecutive session as the Wig index fell
376.5 or 3.6 per cent to 10,221.7.
Turnover declined by 5 per cent to 995bn zlotys as volume rose 49 per cent
to 2.7m shares
ISTANBUL fell 1.6 per cent in a volatile session, which concentrated mainly
state industries after the head of the privatisation agency urged that the
privatisation programme should be accelerated.
The composite index lost 217.34 to 16,536.4, having begun the day at
17,225.65. Turnover dropped to TL1,183bn.

FT  08 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets: South African gold shares advance on
rise in bullion
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Gold shares in Johannesburg improved sharply following a rise in bullion
above Dollars 380 an ounce. However, industrials lacked direction, while
there was steady interest in De Beers, up R3.25 at R112.25.
The overall index rose 56 to 5,518, industrials 6 to 6,545 and golds 56 to
1,979.
Among other movers, Anglos added R6 at R227.50 and JCI was 50 cents better
at R95.50.
Remgro depressed the industrial index with a 75-cent fall to R26.75 on fears
that it could suffer from possible taxes on cigarettes and alcohol.
Gencor appreciated 5 cents to R10.70, Richemont slipped 25 cents to R39.50
in good volume and Minorco moved ahead R4.50 to R111.
Absa shed 15 cents to R8.70 as its strong showing of the past week ran out
of steam, although dealers said the market remained positive about its
prospects. In golds, Kloof climbed R3 to R50.50 and Vaal Reefs R11 to R401.
The Council of Southern African Banks said yesterday that it had rejected
recommendations for an evolutionary restructuring of the Johannesburg Stock
Exchange, and warned that without full deregulation a rival exchange could
be set up.
The council said that without full deregulation there would be 'no option
but to apply for a licence to establish a rival stock exchange'.
The move followed the JSE's release of its restructuring proposals last
month.

FT  08 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Late buying spurt takes
Nikkei back above 21,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PATTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
After a lacklustre morning and afternoon which produced modest gains in
light trading, a wave of buying drove the market back above the 21,000 mark
in the final minutes of the day, writes Robert Patton in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 average saw a day's low of 20,735.05 at the opening but,
largely on foreign buying and sporadic bargain hunting after three days of
declines, was lifted gently through the morning and most of the afternoon.
In the final minutes of trading a barrage of futures-linked buy orders
pushed the index up sharply to a close of 21,042.71 for a rise of 316.06,
just below the session's high of 21,053.71 recorded seconds earlier.
The capital-weighted Nikkei 300 gained 3.65 at 307.31 and the Topix index of
all first section stocks put on 17.06 at 1,681.58. Volume was an estimated
270m shares. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was 0.68 firmer at 1,389.39.
Large-capital and high-technology stocks came back to lead the advance. Oki
Electric, the day's volume leader with 12.7m shares traded, climbed Y24 to
Y708. Fuji Heavy Industries, the manufacturer of Subaru cars, was up Y14 to
Y470 in the day's second highest volume of 5.7m shares. Other auto makers
also gained, Mazda Motors roaring up Y33 to Y621 and Isuzu Motors adding Y16
at Y517.
Nintendo rose Y20 to Y6,630 in spite of a morning report that the game maker
had been found guilty of patent infringement by a US Federal court. The
case, which could cost Nintendo Dollars 350m, is being appealed with a
damage ruling expected on July 18.
More and more traders were talking about higher share prices in the near to
medium term. One analyst, basing his optimism on the recent strength in a
number of retail areas, particularly ladies' garment sales, suggested that
the Nikkei could gain 20 per cent this year.
But another area of garment retailing took a beating in today's market. The
menswear discounters, Aoki International and Aoyama Trading, dropped Y220 to
Y2,380 and Y100 to Y517 respectively. Both companies, especially Aoyama,
have been extremely profitable but competition has been mounting rapidly,
with many traditional large retailers now moving into deep discounting.
In Osaka the OSE average put on 120.21 at 23,802.81 in volume of 110m
shares.
Roundup
Some sharp falls were registered in the region yesterday.
BANGKOK was heartened, however, by an easing of domestic political tensions,
prompting investors to buy finance and bank issues. The SET index rose
20.38, or 1.5 per cent, to 1,383.39 in turnover of Bt10.06bn, more than
double Monday's Bt4.5bn.
A two-week hunger strike by a political activist, Chalad Worachat, who was
demanding democratic reforms, had increased tension within the ruling
coalition. But yesterday political parties agreed to support his latest
proposal to set up a committee to study drafting a new charter.
The banking sector accounted for almost half of the day's trade. Bangkok
Bank closed Bt6 higher at Bt188.
HONG KONG encountered futures related selling linked to speculation about
today's government property package, aimed at cooling the overheated
residential property market, and renewed rumours about the health of the
Chinese leader, Deng Xiaoping. The Hang Seng index lost 135.15, or 1.4 per
cent, at 9,247.88 in turnover that rose to HKDollars 3.6bn from Monday's
HKDollars 2.8bn.
Property issues were the hardest hit. Cheung Kong shed 75 cents to HKDollars
38.25, Henderson Land 75 cents to HKDollars 40.50 and Sun Hung Kai
Properties HKDollars 1.50 to HKDollars 51.
China stocks were mixed. The state-run Dongfang Electrical Machinery eased
back from its high, but still ended with a 10-cent gain at HKDollars 3.275
on its second day of trading.
SINGAPORE was mixed, with losses in a few index stocks dragging the Straits
Times Industrial index down 24.70 to 2,267.21 in thin volume of 106.1m
shares. Fraser &amp; Neave, SDollars 18.30, and Inchcape, SDollars 5.65, dipped
20 cents apiece.
Negara Hotel made a further 30-cent gain to SDollars 6.50 on further
redevelopment speculation, but profits were taken in Seaview Hotel, driving
it down 70 cents to SDollars 10.40.
SEOUL remained worried about the North Korea nuclear problem and the
composite index ended 8.54 lower at 921.72, after touching 914.94, in
turnover of Won585.2bn.
Against the trend, institutional demand helped low-priced construction
stocks to make gains. Among them, Poonglim Industry and Shinwha Engineering
&amp; Construction went limit up by adding Won600 each at Won11,200 and
Won15,100 respectively.
MANILA saw its fourth consecutive decline as profits were taken in blue
chips and foreign institutions sold San Miguel and Manila Electric.
The composite index shed 27.52 to 2,994.54 as turnover rose to 851.3m pesos
from Monday's 633.9m. San Miguel 'B' fell 2.8 per cent to 135 pesos and
Manila Electric 'B' 2.7 per cent to 357.50 pesos.
SYDNEY was supported by buying of industrials, but further weakness in gold
stocks left the All Ordinaries index 2.3 easier at 2,070.2. Turnover
amounted to ADollars 357m.
Brokers said a fall in the price of gold bullion overnight contributed to
negative sentiment, and forecasts were that the bullion price would remain
under pressure for the next few days.
The gold shares index recovered some ground to close 14.6 off at 2,223.4,
after a session low of 2,202.5.
Fears over the future of mining projects in Papua New Guinea also upset
investors after the government there suspended further proposals. Among
companies involved in mining in PNG, Niugini lost 5 cents at ADollars 5.10
and Highlands Gold 2 cents at ADollars 1.38.
In industrials, News Corp fell 8 cents to ADollars 8.90. Foster's Brewing
was steady at ADollars 1.14 after announcing a corporate restructuring on
Monday.
TAIPEI finished off the day's low on late buying in the electronics sector.
The weighted index was down 7.40 at 6,069.85, after 6,028.03. Turnover
declined to TDollars 66.2bn from Monday's TDollars 73.8bn.
WELLINGTON, closed on Monday, saw the NZSE-40 capital index slip 17.12 to
2,121.88.
An announcement that a three-year ban on logging in the Pacific Northwest US
region had been lifted triggered a wave of selling in forestry stocks that
spread to other sectors. Telecom went against the trend with a rise of 8
cents to NZDollars 5.11.
KUALA LUMPUR closed firmer but off its highs after a late round of
profit-taking in a session dominated by second line stocks. The composite
index added 2.36 at 972.42.
KARACHI opened a new account with bullish sentiment in energy stocks, on
rumours of favourable treatment for the industry in tomorrow's budget. The
KSE 100 index advanced 22.5 to 2,239.32, with Sui Northern Gas up Rs3 at
Rs68.50.

FT  08 JUN 94 / Markets Report: Dollar treads water
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar traded steadily on foreign exchanges yesterday, with no fresh
data to give the market direction, writes Philip Gawith.
The US currency held on to its recent gains to finish in London at DM1.6695,
after DM1.6692 on Monday. Against the yen it ended at Y105.235 from
Y105.350.
The dollar fell back later in US trading after Mr Mickey Kantor, the US
trade representative, said the US would use trade laws if framework talks
fail to open Japanese markets. The US currency finished New York trading at
DM1.6667 and Y104.225.
Traders said the recent pattern of foreign exchange markets playing second
fiddle to the bond markets had persisted. Currency trade was directionless,
with 'very little to go for', one dealer said.
The pound also had a steady day, the sterling index closing at 80.5 from
80.6 on Monday.
In Europe the D-Mark was slightly weaker ahead of the weekly repo
announcement today, and the European elections tomorrow and later in the
week.
In European trading the dollar showed little reaction to earlier news that
Germany's economy had grown by an annualised 2.1 per cent in the first
quarter - above market expectations.
It was also unmoved by comments from Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US treasury
secretary, suggesting that the fall in US unemployment to 6 per cent in May,
from 6.4 per cent in April, might be subject to revision. The strength of
this figure was a key factor accounting for the rise in the dollar last
Friday.
Mr Kantor's comments, however, had more impact on the market. Speaking to
reporters at the annual meeting in Paris of the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development, he said: 'Our goals and strategies have not
changed. We will open the Japanese markets either through the framework or
through US trade laws.'
His observations served as a timely reminder of one of the factors that has
depressed the dollar in recent months. Some commentators thought they had
recently detected a change in US administration policy towards the dollar.
Mr Paul Chertkow, for example, head of global currency research at UBS,
spoke of the 'end of the policy of dollar debasement by the Clinton
administration to exert pressure on the Japanese authorities to undertake
measures to increase imports'. But Mr Kantor's comments suggest it may be
business as usual.
The flip side of recent dollar strength has been a softening of the D-Mark
on the perception that the dollar enjoys investor support.
The D-Mark finished in London at FFr3.317 against the French franc from
FFr3.412 on Monday. Mr David Cocker, economist at Chemical Bank in London,
likened the franc's recent strength to a 'snail running for the finishing
line'. He said the franc might rise to FFr3.39, but said this could still
take some time.
One European currency that slipped against the D-Mark was the Swedish krona,
which closed at SKr4.755 from SKr4.738. Analysts attributed this to the sale
of bonds by foreigners, on fears of inflation, and worries that Austria
might vote 'no' in Sunday's referendum about accession to the European
Union. Sweden also wishes to join the EU.
Another feature of an otherwise quiet day was a series of comments from
European government figures and central bankers about possible falls in
interest rates. Mr Edmond Alphandery, the French economy minister, said
there was still room for European interest rates to fall. This message was
echoed by Mr Erik Hoffmeyer, the Danish central bank governor, and Mr
Guenther Rexrodt, the German economics minister.
As yet the European elections have impacted little on the market
consciousness. Mr Cocker comments: 'The total apathy of the voting public
will probably spill over into the markets.' The possible exceptions to this
rule might be the UK, Spain and Germany, where bad results could result in
political instability and currency weakness.
There is also speculation that with the election past, the Greek government
might relent in its defence of the drachma. Were the drachma to fall in
value, this could spill over into other weak European currencies such as the
Spanish peseta and Portuguese escudo.
Markets are anticipating a 3 to 5 basis-point fall in the German repo rate
when the result of the weekly auction is announced today. The rate is
currently 5.15 per cent. German call money rates firmed slightly to about
5.10/5.20 per cent from Monday's 5.05/5.15 per cent.
In the UK money markets, the Bank of England provided late assistance of
Pounds 95m, compared to a forecast shortage of Pounds 300m. The overnight
rate traded between 4 1/4 per cent and 6 3/8 per cent.
In the futures markets, short sterling gave up some of its recent gains. The
December contract saw 23,000 lots traded and finished at 93.78 from 93.86.
The December Euromark contract traded nearly 44,000 lots and closed four
basis points lower at 94.73.

FT  08 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: China takes over from Japan as
top wool buyer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China emerged in 1993 as the world's top customer for raw wool for the first
time, overtaking Japan, according to an International Wool Secretariat
study.
China's wool use last year accounted for about 20 per cent of world
production, and this is set to reach 25 per cent by the year 2000 at the
present rate of growth.
'Total wool use has increased a remarkable 2.75 times since 1980 when it
accounted for only 7 per cent of global wool production,' the study said.
About two-thirds of wool used in China is imported, with Australian supplies
accounting for half of total imports. New Zealand weighs in with about 25
per cent and Uruguay 10 per cent. South Africa, the other IWS member,
supplies a relatively small amount.
In 1992, imports of raw wool and tops reached a value of USDollars 764m and
65 to 70 per cent was consumed within the domestic market. Semi-processed
and finished wool textile products earned China about UDollars 1.3bn in
1992.
'Raw wool and top imports into China could well increase by nearly 60 per
cent from 1992 to 2000, accounting for up to one-third of Australian and New
Zealand wool production by 2000,' the study said.
The study found that 'Greater China' - including China, Hong Kong and Macau
 -had become the fastest growing market for IWS members over the past
decade. Australian exports as a percentage of total wool exports had almost
trebled in that period.
But the study, prepared by the UK-based Wool Development International,
warned that China's market was liable to sharp fluctuations caused by sudden
changes in economic policy. In 1989-90, China's withdrawal from the market
had contributed to the rapid rise in raw wool stocks in producing countries.
'With further promised economic liberalisation, rising foreign investment,
increased consumer affluence and possible Gatt membership, China has the
potential to continue as the fastest growing market for wool textiles and
clothing in the world,' the study concluded.
'At the same time given its recent history of stop-go economic cycles, wool
price sensitivity, and political uncertainty, it could be the most volatile
and unpredictable market.'
The IWS is sponsored by Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and Uruguay.
The organisation became active in the Chinese wool market in the early 1980s
and is involved in assisting China to upgrade its wool processing.

FT  08 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: More transparency urged for
London bullion market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The London bullion market should become more transparent if it does not want
to lose ground to New York, the Financial Times World Gold Conference was
told in London yesterday.
Mr James Riley, a partner with J. Aron &amp; Company/Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co, said
failure to make the market more open would ensure that New York, where Comex
trades gold futures, would 'remain the home to gold price transparency'.
While the London fix provided the benchmark for physical gold, 'no-one knows
the turnover on a fix'.
Mr Riley also predicted a rise in the gold price to Dollars 414 a troy ounce
this year as gold began to be treated once more as a long-term asset, rather
than as a commodity. He cited a report that Fidelity, a leading US fund, had
4 per cent of its assets in commodities.
Mr Victor von Klemperer, senior manager with Dresdner Bank, suggested that
the Bundesbank, which holds almost 3,000 tonnes of gold, was looking
seriously at mobilising some of its reserves following the budget deficit
pressures 'brought on by the horrendous costs of reunification'.
'This topic will obviously gain in actuality in a year when they don't have
a DM18bn surplus to transfer to the finance ministry,' he told the
conference.
Mr Norbert Schroff, a senior precious metals manager at Credit Suisse, said
Zurich was the premier physical gold market. In the past 10 years it had
imported an average of between 1,200 and 1,400 tonnes, and exported between
1,000 and 1,200 tonnes.
The level of imports was equivalent to 70 per cent of western mine
production and 40 per cent of total world supplies. 'It is clear from these
figures that Zurich is holding its own not only as the centre of gold trade
in Switzerland, but also as the world's principal trading arena for physical
gold,' he said.
Mr Timothy Green, chief consultant with Gold Fields Mineral Services, said
that physical demand for gold in the Middle East and India had accepted the
higher trading range of around Dollars 380 an ounce more quickly than
expected.
'I happened to be in Jeddah earlier this year when the price slipped
momentarily to Dollars 375. Jeddah ran out of physical gold that day as
people covered unfixed positions. And from then on I was much less concerned
about the downside risk of the price.'
Mr Robert Ashley, director and head of treasury at Rothschild Australia,
said that although Chinese gold consumption was down last year by about 30
tonnes, its consumption of 325 tonnes made it the second biggest consumer
behind the US.
He pointed out that prosperity continued to increase, with Chinese bank
savings passing USDollars 100bn. There were about 800m farmers who had not
yet bought gold.
With inflation at 22 per cent and the political uncertainty that would
attend the post-Deng Xao Ping era, gold would benefit from its status as a
reliable store of wealth.
'In the 1920s and 1930s Shanghai was the third largest gold market behind
London and New York,' he said.
'The influence of China in the market in 1993 demonstrated that it is
regaining lost ground.'
Mr Yuri Mityuk, head of treasury at the Bank for Foreign Trade of the
Russian Federation, said the Russian gold mining industry was expected to
produce 150 to 155 tonnes this year, compared with 149.5 tonnes in 1993.
This could be considered a sign that the bottom in Russian production had
been reached.
He said the Russian finance ministry was eager to help the industry and
suggested that cuts in both the number and level of both federal and local
taxes would promote new investment and increase efficiency.

FT  08 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Australian growers emerging
from the gloom - Nikki Tait on a marked turnabout over the past six months
in the sector's fortunes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT

<TEXT>
Next month, Wool International, the newly-constituted keeper of Australia's
vast wool stockpile, will begin a fixed monthly schedule of sales in an
effort to pare back the stocks. The regular sales programme, involving
28,000 bales a month at the outset, has been stipulated by law - the same
federal legislation that set up the government-owned body at the end of last
year.
A year ago, the prospect of a steady supply dripping on to the market would
have sent shudders down any Australian wool-grower's spine. Indeed, it is
only 16 months since Mr Wayne Goss, Queensland's premier, suggested that the
stockpile's 3.96m bales should be burnt, to remove the supply overhang and
save storage costs.
Today, however, the industry's attitude can only be described as relaxed.
'It's fundamental that the stockpile is sold and debt paid down,' says the
Wool Council of Australia, the main growers' organisation, adding that it
supports the open, orderly process. Mr Bob Quirk, head of the Australian
Council of Wool Exporters, also predicts that regular stockpile sales should
not prove disruptive.
This sudden sang-froid owes much to a marked turnabout over the past six
months in the fortunes of Australia's wool industry, one of the nation's
biggest export earners and the source of about 30 per cent of the world's
wool production.
On April 28 1993, the sector hit rock-bottom. The local market indicator
price plunged to 381 cents a kilogram, clean, the lowest level seen this
century. Yet by the end of last week, the same marker had recovered to
around 625 cents. While this may be only half the level seen in the headiest
days of the late-1980s, prices above the 600 cents-mark seemed way beyond
many growers' dreams last year.
The sea-change has come about for two main reasons. The first is the
recovery, or anticipated recovery, in Australia's traditional export
markets. The biggest buyers of Australian wool include a number of western
European countries - notably France, Italy and Germany - along with two
Asian customers, Japan and Korea. For the most part, their economies are
either on the mend, or thought likely to be improving by the end of 1994.
'There's been a quite sustained level of demand from all the traditional
markets,' says Mr Quirk. 'We've seen considerable demand from western
Europe, including Germany, and Japan. There is a growing degree of
confidence'.
At the same time, he suggests, China's new role as the biggest overseas
buyer of Australian wool is moving on to a firmer footing. Even in the
industry's gloomiest moments, this was a ray of light, with the country
taking around 21 per cent of Australian wool exports in 1992-93. But Mr
Quirk suggests that one of the most encouraging features is that an
increasing amount of Chinese-purchased wool is being retained for domestic
use (rather than re-export). He puts the retained figure at 70 to 80 per
cent, up from perhaps 30 per cent in the past.
In the meantime, grower supply has also contracted, and stocks in the wool
processing pipeline are thought to have declined. According to the
Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics, the number of sheep
shorn in 1993-94 is likely to fall by 5 per cent or so, to about 169m, and
then ease back to 166m in 1994-95.
All these developments have made Wool International's job considerably
easier. The stockpile built up under the industry's previous guaranteed
pricing structure, and was originally the responsibility of the now-defunct
Australian Wool Realisation Commission. Wool International, the brainchild
of Professor Ross Garnaut at Australian National University, whose
recommendations on the restructuring of Australia's wool industry were
adopted wholesale by the federal government last year, took it over at the
beginning of December.
The new institution, which is scheduled to be privatised by 1997, has been
charged with selling 28,000 bales a month during the latter half of 1994,
and then 187,000 bales a quarter in 1995.
But, already, it has more than tested the waters. In March, April and May,
its sales averaged about 40,000 bales a month, well ahead of the stipulated
levels (which permit only small 'tolerances' on either side). As a result,
by the end of last month, the stockpile had reduced to under 3.69m bales. In
large part, the fact that WI has already been pushing out stockpile sales in
excess of its proscribed post-June monthly targets explains the relaxed
attitudes to its impending permanent market presence.
Perhaps the biggest remaining question is whether China will remain in the
market in such a substantial fashion, given the recent rise in prices. At
least some observers predict that prices will ease back in the second half
of 1994, but should then resume a steady climb next year.
Still, if an air of stability has finally returned to the beleaguered
industry, Australia's 65,000 growers are not cheering yet.
At prices of about 600 cents a kilogram, they say that it is possible to
survive. But, after the horrendous conditions of the past three years, there
is a backlog of investment and renovation work to be done and current price
levels still provide little margin.
And already, the federal government is whipping away some of the emergency
financial aid - in the form of interest subsidies and the like - that it
introduced in the industry's darkest hours last year. That move, says the
WCA, is 'premature'.

FT  08 JUN 94 / World Commodities Prices: Copper leads LME base metals rally
 -Market Report

<TEXT>
COPPER led other base metals contracts higher in late trading at the London
Metal Exchange yesterday.
After dipping to Dollars 2,233 a tonne early in the day the three months
position closed the afternoon ring at Dollars 2,270, up Dollars 28 on
balance. But as investment fund buyers became active again in New York the
LME price moved still higher in after hour trading, topping Dollars 2,300.
The three months ALUMINIUM price consolidated morning gains to close at
Dollars 1,373.25 a tonne, up Dollars 9.75. And it added a few dollars more
after hours.
At the London Commodity Exchange September delivery COFFEE futures recovered
from a morning fall to Dollars 1,985 a tonne to close at Dollars 2,024,
still Dollars 4 in arrears.
'It's not so much selling pressure as a lack of active buying that is
keeping the market down,' said one trader. 'It's really very quiet, the
market is trying to consolidate.'

FT  08 JUN 94 / Survey of New Zealand (7): Unpopular sales prompt caution -
Privatisation has proved to be a political liability
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY HALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Political problems have slowed the National government's plans to sell
further state assets, in spite of the philosophical view of most of the
cabinet that they should be in private hands.
The government this year stalled speculation that it was preparing New
Zealand Post and Electricorp for sale. It said it was honouring pre-election
commitments not to sell them. However, intense behind-the-scenes pressure is
being applied persuade it to sell other assets, such as state radio and
television, the former ministry of works, Workscorp, the government computer
services company and parts of the property company Landcorp.
But conservative elements in the government are treading warily, and not all
of these sales may happen, because of opposition from other political
parties and the approach of the new 'mixed member proportional' (MMP)
electoral system. Opposition parties are irate that the issue has even
arisen, given the 'consensus' that is supposed to exist due to the
government's narrow majority.
Privatisation has proved a political liability. It was a major factor in the
defeat in 1990 of the reformist Labour government, after it had rushed the
sale of some NZDollars 12bn of state assets. On the campaign trail that
year, Jim Bolger, the National leader, implied that there would be no
further sales. So there was anger in some circles when the Bank of New
Zealand was subsequently sold.
Since then, despite the presence of staunch advocates of privatisation in
the cabinet, only one other major asset, New Zealand Rail, has been sold.
The Bank of New Zealand went to the National Bank of Australia for NZDollars
1.4bn, and New Zealand Railways to US railway company Wisconsim Central and
a consortium of New Zealand investors for NZDollars 320m.
Both sales proved unpopular with large sections of the public. Small
shareholders in the Bank of New Zealand, who had no option but to sell,
mounted a spirited protest campaign, saying it was being sold too cheaply.
They now say that BNZ's subsequent strong profit recovery and reduction in
bad-debt provisioning has proved them right.
There were similar complaints over the sale of the national railway network.
Trade unionists - embroiled in a bitter fight over plans by the new US
owners to cut staffing levels on the Cook Strait ferries, the vital link
between the North and South islands - are making much of the fact that the
new owner is introducing American work practices and seeking to cut jobs.
Polls suggest that most voters oppose selling 'the family silver', although
there is a widespread acknowledgement that it is vital to reduce the
country's indebtedness. Part of the problem is that Labour used little of
the money it raised in paying off debt, in spite of promises to do so.
National has been careful to use any money raised in asset sales for debt
repayment.
There is also continuing public concern that many assets were sold too
cheaply. Telecom, for example, was sold for NZDollars 4.25bn to US phone
companies Bell Atlantic and Ameritech, amid suggestions that it was worth
twice that. It has proved a profitable investment for its US controlling
shareholders.
Philip Burdon, minister of state owned enterprises, said in May that public
disquiet was the major reason why the privatisation programme had slowed. It
was the reason why Electricorp and New Zealand Post were not being
privatised.
Mr Burdon said he had no philosophical objections to the government's
selling the enterprises. 'I do not believe that state ownership is an
effective form of administration.' He said there was public disquiet over
the selling of public utilities. However, that did not extend to the sale of
other assets such as the government computer company, GCS, which has been
put on the market.
Most interest appears to centre on the sale of Television Two, the second
state-owned television channel. A number of buyers have indicated their
interest, including both major newspaper publishing chains, Independent
Newspapers, which is controlled by News Corporation, and Wilson and Horton,
publisher of the country's biggest daily, the New Zealand Herald. Television
New Zealand is fighting doggedly to retain the ownership.
The 40-strong commercial radio network operated by Radio New Zealand is also
expected to be sold. The major problem appears to centre on the future of
public radio, the BBC-style network of the Concert Programme and national
services broadcasting. The systems are linked, sharing news and current
affairs staffs.
The government is expected shortly to offer some NZDollars 2bn of
low-interest mortgages owned by the Housing Corporation. Earlier it sold
NZDollars 500m-worth to a consortium led by merchant bank Fay Richwhite.
Maurice Williamson, one of the leading reformers in the cabinet, has been
lobbying hard for the sale of the three major airports, in Auckland,
Wellington and Christchurch, but has won no public support from his
colleagues.
The most imminent sale is that of the computer company, GCS. This runs a
major installation at Wanganui, in the North Island, which centralises all
police files and other confidential information on individuals. The
government says that GCS will not be sold until a code of practice
protecting confidential information is in place.
The minister of finance, Bill Birch, said last month that there would be no
fire sales, and that assets would be sold only when the government was
confident of getting the best prices. 'But we do have a list of businesses
for possible sale, which we consider are no longer appropriate for the
government to own in today's environment.'
Supporters of privatisation look bleakly at the future. They feel that this
is the last chance to sell many of the remaining state assets. It is
believed New Zealand will have minority governments under the MMP political
system; and this, they say, would tie the hands of any minister of finance
who might wish to sell any of the NZDollars 2bn of assets that have been
prepared for sale.

FT  08 JUN 94 / Survey of New Zealand (9): Asia discovers the south -
Improved air links are helping tourism to take off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY HALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After many false starts, New Zealand's tourist industry believes it has a
winning formula - a view reinforced by the rapidly rising number of
visitors.
Even 150 years ago, settlers from Europe spotted the country's leisure
potential. One relatively small country seemed to offer just about
everything: hundreds of miles of warm, sandy beaches in the sub-tropical
north, remarkable volcanic geysers, mountain-climbing, skiing, wilderness
bush walks, ample fish and game hunting.
From the 1870s, tourist hotels began to appear in the most popular
destinations, and later the government added its support.
Visitor numbers ebbed and flowed, distance always being a problem.
Initially, only wealthy tourists from the US and Europe had the time for
long sea voyages. Closer to home, as air links developed, Australians might
enjoy visiting New Zealand, three hours away, for an annual skiing holiday.
Now, mass air travel is changing perceptions. New Zealand is today served by
24 international airlines that link it to most parts of the world. Tourist
numbers are climbing, helped by the economic recovery. Between January and
March, 400,000 visitors arrived, 17 per cent more than in the same period of
last year.
March alone saw a 21 per cent increase (to 139,000) over the same month last
year. Visitors from the UK represented the strongest growth (up 26 per
cent), followed by the Netherlands (up 22 per cent). In the year to March
31, visitor numbers grew by 12 per cent, to 1,213,318, the strongest growth
this decade.
Norman Geary, chairman of the New Zealand Tourism Board, says the recovery
has been startling. Between 1988 and 1991, annual arrivals had risen by an
average of 3.8 per cent, compared with the world average growth rate of 5.2
per cent. But since 1992 visitor numbers have been growing by an average 10
per cent a year, substantially ahead of the world's average growth of 3.8
per cent projected for the 1990s by the World Tourism Organisation.
The industry is encouraged by the increase, because, for much of the period,
most of the countries from which visitors came - Australia, North America,
Britain, Japan and Germany - were coping with recession. Mr Geary is
confident that the industry's goal of 2m tourists a year by 2000 will be
met.
Its strategy is one of sustained promotion in target countries, and a
reasonable level of government support. Assisting the drive are independent
operators, including Air New Zealand, which has extended its services to
much of Asia during the past 18 months.
The South Korean market has developed strongly. Koreans' interest in New
Zealand is high, because they have become one of the largest migrant groups;
and in the year to March, 40,000 visited, compared with a few hundred in
1990.
Taiwanese numbers have also risen. Nearly 50,000 visited New Zealand in the
year to March, up from 10,000 in 1991. The recession in Japan has impeded
growth, although numbers have continued to climb (145,000 in the same
period, compared with 100,000 a year earlier).
Numbers like these are forcing New Zealand to improve facilities. One
regular complaint from Asian tourists is that, while there is plenty to do
during the day, there are insufficient attractions at night. Two
international-standard casinos are being built, in Auckland and
Christchurch, and others will follow in major towns. Relaxed migration
policies, which open the door to anyone who meets the criteria, have led to
the opening of hundreds of ethnic restaurants and night clubs.
However, Mr Geary acknowledges that much still needs to be done. More hotels
must be built, involving substantial investment. Asian developers,
especially from Singapore and Hong Kong, have invested heavily in the sector
during the past three years, but have concentrated on buying existing
hotels.
Despite new labour laws, which have substantially cut wage bills,
profitability remains low in the hotel industry. Mr Geary and others fear
that, unless new hotels are built in Christchurch, Auckland and the major
destination of Queenstown, tourist numbers will not increase - already it is
often difficult to get a room.
Mr Geary believes improved profitability is essential if the industry's
potential is to be maximised. He says government support is vital, and
points out that foreign exchange earnings from visitors is 21 per cent ahead
of 1991 levels, and that the industry is a major employer of labour.

FT  08 JUN 94 / Survey of New Zealand (8): The Tasman looks narrower - Trade
has spurred reciprocal investment flows with Australia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY HALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Recent trading successes, and indications of political goodwill, appear to
be breaking down the often intense and historic rivalry between New Zealand
and its resource-rich neighbour Australia.
Australians are showing increasing interest in the economic reform programme
in New Zealand, although it is acknowledged that political realities make it
unlikely that some of the tax and labour regulations will find their way
into law there. Investment flows between the countries are growing rapidly,
spurred by the trade pact, Closer Economic Relations (CER).
Signed in 1982, CER has been of immense importance to New Zealand. For
decades Australia, with Britain, was the major supplier of manufactured
goods. Trade traditionally ran two-to-one in Australia's favour, but today
it is in balance: each country increased its exports to the other by 12 per
cent last year.
New Zealanders are pressing Australia to further develop the agreement and
move towards a fuller integration of the two economies. But there was
disappointment in May, when some Australian officials argued that 'CER has
gone about as far as it can.' The Australians refuse to examine issues such
as harmonising taxation, matching manufacturing standards, and freeing up
mutual investment options.
After initial rapid progress, aviation reform also appears to have stalled.
The agreement has allowed Air New Zealand to establish a 'hub' in Brisbane,
to service the Asian market. This has proved of immense benefit to the
airline and created thousands of jobs in Queensland as Asian holidaymakers
flock in.
However, Australians have been slow to use the 'beyond rights' that they
gained to New Zealand in the reciprocal aviation deal. New Zealand is
anxious to see Ansett flying the Tasman Sea between the two countries.
Both countries seem to be ignoring one of the most delicate issues: rules of
origin. New Zealand manufacturers operate in a largely tariff-free
environment, and can buy raw materials, such as plastic, cheaply on the
world market. However, Australia retains import protection for its own
manufacturing goods. This situation appears to benefit New Zealand
manufacturers in selling to Australia, as it keeps up the price of
Australian inputs.
Rowland Crone, president of the New Zealand Manufacturers' Federation, says
action on these issues is a priority and would further strengthen CER trade
and economic ties. Behind Mr Crone's concern are statements by the
Australian prime minister, Paul Keating, who, in a visit to Thailand last
month, spoke of extending CER to the six Asean nations.
New Zealand officials are also keen to see freer trade between the two
blocs. However, Mr Crone argues that to compete equably with the dynamic
Asean countries, New Zealand and Australia must settle the remaining
outstanding issues between them over CER.
Political differences became intense in the mid-1980s, over defence,
highlighted by New Zealand's withdrawal from ANZUS, the pact with Australia
and the US. Since last year, relations have improved, following a state
visit to New Zealand by Mr Keating, who appears to have developed an
excellent relationship with the New Zealand prime minister, Jim Bolger.
In many areas, apart from trade, the ties are growing steadily stronger.
Defence links appear to have improved, and there is close liaison on police
and crime matters.
However, the Australians continue to keep a close eye on New Zealand. There
were grumbles in New Zealand after Australia's April budget: many people
complained that it contained a tax incentive measure that was expressly
aimed at encouraging companies to base their head offices and manufacturing
facilities in Australia rather than New Zealand.
This followed moves to New Zealand by a string of companies, to take
advantage of the lower tax, cost and wage structure. A major attraction was
the Employment Contracts Act, which has introduced greater flexibility in
wage bargaining but is labelled an anti-union measure in Australia.
Among companies moving to New Zealand, or expanding there, were Gillette,
Unilever, Johnson &amp; Johnson and Alcatel, which supplies wiring systems for
the Australian car industry. All use New Zealand as a base to supply
Australia and Asia.
A recent study by Trust Bank found that major companies were coming to New
Zealand because of its low inflation. It found that costs were being held as
industry developed flexibility, and said productivity of New Zealand
industry had risen by 28 per cent in the five years to last December, using
no more staff or overtime hours.
A number of New Zealand companies are expanding in Australia. They include
Pacific Star, a subsidiary of Telecom New Zealand, which is a major supplier
to telecommunications equipment to the Queensland government and larger
companies; and the white-goods manufacturer Fisher and Paykel, which has
built a large plant in Queensland.
The growth of sales to Australia has been a factor in the surge of optimism
seen recently among New Zealand manufacturers. Business confidence is at its
highest level for two decades, and the Manufacturers' Federation believes
economic growth could touch 6 per cent by June, after years of running
between zero and 2 per cent a year.
In the year to December 31, the strengthening New Zealand economy led to the
creation of 42,000 jobs, of which 23,000 were fulltime positions in
manufacturing. Many more were created in allied industries that service the
manufacturing sector. The Statistics Department reported in March that
employment in the manufacturing sector was up 9.7 per cent.
The strength in manufacturing is spreading through the economy, and the
extra jobs and spending power is seen as a significant reason for the budget
surplus that is expected this financial year.
Yet all is not going New Zealand's way. Australia, for example, is winning
the trade war on the food front, where it appears to offer cheaper canned
and frozen processed items. Against this, New Zealanders have done well in
light engineering and steel and aluminium fabrication.
Gilbert Petersen, of the Manufacturers' Federation, says that, while there
is a feeling of confidence in the sector, there is no great sense of
security, with the knowledge that the Australians 'could run rings around us
if they wanted to', because their larger population leads to economies of
scale.
It is widely believed that any advantages New Zealand manufacturers have
gained are due to efficiencies learned the hard way, through surviving a
protracted and deep recession. They will battle to keep them, and make the
best possible use of the CER pact.

FT  08 JUN 94 / Survey of New Zealand (5): The faces to watch, as the
country moves to proportional representation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
JIM BOLGER: prime minister and leader of the conservative National party,
which narrowly retained power in the November 1993 election. A practising
Catholic and North Island farmer, Bolger has never been a charismatic figure
to the electorate. But he won plaudits for a statesmanlike performance on
election night, and has demonstrated a speedy grasp of consensus politics.
His recent decision to raise the 'republic' issue has been more puzzling:
opinion polls indicate that the majority of New Zealanders don't favour the
introduction an elected 'presidential' head of state to replace the
Governor-General, appointed by the Queen. HELEN CLARK: leader of the main
opposition Labour party, who took over from Mike Moore shortly after
November's election. A former lecturer in politics at Auckland University,
she has the difficult task of articulating a centre-left policy which
distinguishes Labour from National, yet eschews the more radical changes
promised by the Alliance. Internal party warfare with her predecessor and
his supporters does not make the job any easier. Her low popularity ratings
have led to talk of further leadership changes - although such gossip has
been strongly denied to date.
MIKE MOORE: The one-time builders' labourer was a member of the Lange
government which initiated New Zealand's reforms in the mid-1980s. He became
leader of the ruling Labour party in 1990 shortly before the October
election, but his popularity failed to save Labour's fortunes then, or in
1993. Moore performed poorly amid November's election night uncertainties,
and was soon ousted by Helen Clark. Since then, he has hinted at the
formation of a new centre-left party but, for the moment, remains within the
Labour party. A passionate speaker, Moore still commands substantial loyalty
among the electorate and within his party.
JIM ANDERTON: A former Labour party president who broke away to form the New
Labour party in 1989, and then forged the Alliance, a coalition of five
left-leaning minor parties, in 1991. The Alliance won more than 18 per cent
of the popular vote in November, but only two seats. The grouping sometimes
looks shaky, but Anderton has strong personal support. He has also handled a
number of recent issues - such as the collapse of Fortex meat business, a
major NZ employer - adroitly. The Alliance, which derives support from
traditional Labour voters dissatisfied with the party's centerist leanings,
looks likely to be the clear winner from the move to MMP.
WINSTON PETERS: A former National party cabinet minister, Peters split to
become an independent MP and then formed New Zealand First in July last
year. Its policies going into the 1993 election were not well-detailed, but
it is generally pro-business and has a slightly xenophobic tinge - witness
Peters' recent urgings for a tougher immigration policy. Often viewed as a
maverick but charismatic politician, he has a reputation for revealing
alleged scandals under parliamentary privilege. Earlier this year, his
attention focused on financial abuses supposedly occuring in the Cook
Islands and involving NZ businessmen and international figures.
SIR ROGER DOUGLAS: The former finance minister set New Zealand on the path
to economic reform, but resigned after differences with the then-prime
minister, David Lange. Sir Roger has now left the Labour party and is widely
expected to turn his Association of Consumers and Taxpayers, a free-market
ginger group, into a political party. The ACT has support from the business
community, and is generally in favour of a minimalist approach by
government. Douglas recently published Unfinished Business, a 300-page
dissertation on New Zealand's economic and political situation, suggesting
that the reform process has further to go.

FT  08 JUN 94 / Survey of New Zealand (4): Thoughtful calm follows the
upheaval - Politics, there will be no more first-past-the post parliamentary
elections. Nikki Tait considers the implications
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Winds of change are blowing through New Zealand politics. The question is:
what sort of landscape will remain when they have died down?
The upheavals began on November 6, when voters not only went to the polls in
a general election, but were also asked, via a separate referendum, to
choose an electoral system to be used in future elections.
Both results were surprising. The 1993 election returned a hung parliament -
at least, until a recount in marginal seats resolved the issue, giving the
ruling National party a one-seat majority (turned into a two-seat majority
when a Labour MP agreed to act as Speaker).
More fundamentally, however, voters threw out NZ's British-style
'first-past-the-post' method of electing members to its single-chamber
parliament. Instead, the electorate delivered a clear vote in favour of a
'mixed member proportional' system, a form of proportional representation
which has parallels with certain European electoral arrangements.
Under MMP, the current 99 seats in the NZ parliament will be enlarged to
about 120, but only half of these will be occupied by members representing
specific constituencies. Instead, voters will have two votes - one for their
constituency MP, and one of their preferred political party. The results of
the latter vote will determine how many seats each party has in parliament,
with the necessary number of MPs being drafted in from the party lists to
ensure that each party's overall parliamentary tally corresponds to this
decision.
The vote for MMP was essentially a protest. New Zealand has undergone a
decade of profound, and often painful, economic reform at the hands of both
its major political parties. The Labour government began the process in the
mid-1980s, deregulating financial markets and privatising or corporatising
government-owned businesses. National, which swept to power in 1990,
continued the process, freeing up labour markets and making major changes to
the welfare system.
Going into last November's election, then, many voters saw little to
distinguish the policies promulgated by the two parties, and blamed both for
the less palatable aspects of the reform process, such as high unemployment,
a rising crime rate, visable evidence of poverty on city streets. By
choosing MMP, they endorsed a system which seemed more likely to give minor
parties a meaningful voice in parliament and encourage coalition government.
For example, the Alliance party, a coalition of left-leaning minor parties,
could reasonably expect about 20 seats if it simply repeated its 1993
election performance. It attracted more than 18 per cent of the popular
vote, but, under the old FPP system, secured only two parliamentary seats.
But while a decision has been made as to what type of electoral system New
Zealand will use in future, the practical implications - such as the
redrawing of constituency boundaries and the drafting of party lists - are
taking longer to sort out.
As a result, New Zealand's political scene is strangely becalmed. Both
Labour and National conducted internal personnel changes in the wake of the
last election. In Labour's case, the changes started at the top with the
ousting of Mike Moore as party leader, while National shed its hardline
finance minister, Ruth Richardson. But since then, while rumours of
coalition possibilities and new parties abound, no one seems anxious to rock
the boat too violently until a fresh election under the new rules is
technically feasible.
The few MMP-related matters resolved to date have rarely escaped
controversy. In late-April, for example, the re-registration of Maori voters
was completed, but the outcome was to lift the number of Maori seats from
four to just five. This contrasted with some expectations of up to 11 seats.
Protests from Maori leaders, who claimed that the process had been
under-publicised, followed, as did calls for alternative means of achieving
more meaningful representation. Ideas range from a Maori parliament or Maori
upper house, to the formation of a separate 'Aotearoa' party (the Maori name
for New Zealand).
The question of how individual parties go about drawing up their lists is
less advanced, and none of the main parties has yet settled on a final
method of ranking names. But already two are displaying different approaches
to the thorny question of whether they should attempt to persuade MPs who
will lose their constituencies under MMP to remain within the party fold.
Mr Bolger, prime minister and leader of the National party, earlier this
year took the bold step of publicly acknowledging that some defections were
likely. 'What we are seeing is an inevitable consequence of the role of MMP.
. . There are fewer electorate seats available, and the MPs of the two major
parties are going to see whether or not there is somewhere else they could
find a position of some sort,' he said.
'What we want is. . . their loyalty in terms of any coalition understanding
or any accommodation that they will vote with the government on key issues.'
The wisdom of this statement has been much debated: some observers see it as
a canny acceptance of the inevitable, and believe that, by allowing
defections, Mr Bolger will ease his list problems and yet retain some
loyalty when the time for forming coalitions comes around. Others argue that
National is adding grist to the minor parties' mill. Mr Bolger's stance
contrasts with that of Labour's Helen Clark, who appears more intent on
retaining members within the party fold.
The repercussions of the MMP vote, meanwhile, do not provide the easiest
background against which to govern - and in general Mr Bolger's National
party has been taking an unprovocative, some might say conciliatory, tack.
It is true that much of the reform process was already complete on going
into the 1993 election, with most of the major privatisations complete, and
thorny subjects such as industrial relations law in place.
But National has become somewhat more responsive to voter concerns -
introducing a minimum youth wage, for example, and setting up a taskforce to
look at the unemployment issue. Controversial further potential
privatisations, like NZ Electricity and NZ Post, are also off the agenda.
One remaining bone of contention is the Employment Contracts Act (ECA), the
legislation which effectively deregulated the labour market. When the
current parliamentary session began last month, Labour, the Alliance and Mr
Winston Peters' New Zealand First were all proposing changes - with Labour
suggesting that a new employment council should draw up a replacement for
the act, and that the ECA be repealed by 1995. However, the government was
sticking to its guns, insisting that, if the matter was pushed to a
confidence vote, it would win.
Many in the business community clearly hope that New Zealanders' rebellion
peaked on November 6, and that, after a couple of years of solid economic
growth, the electorate's disquiet will have ebbed. Whether the National
party government survives that long is the key question. It is widely
accepted that the mechanisms required to hold an MMP election will not be in
place before next April or May. Mr Bolger has also indicated that he will
seek to govern for the full three-year term, if members of his own party
permit him to do so.
But some observers suspect that a showdown, in the form of a vote of
confidence, is inevitable before then. 'The hot money,' suggests one
Wellington-based economist, 'is on August 1995'. By then, it is argued, the
MMP processes will be in place, and MPs, anxious to maximise personal
positions, will have started to defect from the major parties. Why wait?

FT  08 JUN 94 / Survey of New Zealand (6): 'Few farmers mourn subsidies' -
Terry Hall sees agriculture benefiting from economic reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY HALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
New Zealand's farmers are in a sunny, expansive mood. They have enjoyed the
best summer in memory with just the right amount of sun and rain encouraging
spirited grass growth. Cattle, sheep and deer are in excellent condition.
But no summer is perfect. A series of freak hailstorms devastated a fifth of
the country's apple crop, and more rain than usual caused harvesting
difficulties for South Island arable crops such as wheat and barley.
Farming confidence remains high despite a rising Kiwi dollar, which is
eroding export earnings. Prices for lamb, sheep, beef and dairy products
have all dropped over the past four months, although there has been an
encouraging rise in wool incomes.
Farm profitability is expected to rise by 5 per cent this year, mainly due
to higher lamb-kill and wool prices. However, historically, returns are low.
Rob Davison, chief economist with the Meat and Wool Board's economic
service, says that, while farmers' incomes are at the highest level since
1984, they are only two thirds the level recorded in the 1970s and early
1980s.
Those were the years when farmers received generous taxpayer assistance with
subsidies for fertiliser and other inputs to encourage production. In 1984,
the reformist Labour government wiped these out, leading to seven years of
difficulty as farmers were forced to adjust. The most indebted, and those
with uneconomic units, were forced to leave their farms.
Mr Davison says that few farmers want to return to the days of subsidies.
They prefer the risks of the marketplace, believing it is the only
sustainable long-term option. However, he says that all Kiwi farmers wish
that other countries would follow the New Zealand lead.
Farmers are also benefiting from other reforms introduced from 1984. Low
inflation has led to a sharp reduction in costs, as have falls in interest
rates, and fuel and fertiliser costs.
There is optimism that the progressive relaxation of agricultural protection
under the Gatt round from next year will eventually lead to greater benefits
for local farmers. Most exporters expect a minor improvement in prices from
June next year, as a result of Gatt. There is optimism, too, about the
long-term trend, given the Uruguay round's commitment to gradually lower
agricultural barriers over the coming years.
Sharply rising land prices are also adding to farmer confidence. Investment
levels are high, especially from city people, and farms are changing hands
at double and treble the price of five years ago.
Market forces have led to rapidly changing land-use patterns. High dairy
prices over the past three years have led to a spate of conversions of
former sheep and cattle country to dairying. Conversion costs are high, as
dairy farms need ample water and related costly plant. Record land prices in
the traditional dairy provinces of Taranaki and the Waikato have encouraged
many farmers to migrate to areas like Southland and Otago in the deep south,
where land is cheaper.
Other land is being converted to forestry, while low venison prices have
seen some prime land revert to dairying or horticultural use.
The rate of farm conversion to alternative uses has led to forecasts that
suggest that, even if prices improve, New Zealand is unlikely to return to
the days when sheep farming was the mainstay of the agricultural industry,
as there is no longer suitable land available. Vast tracts of the hilly high
country has been converted to forestry, and it takes 25 to 30 years for a
tree to reach maturity. Sheep numbers have dropped from 73m in 1984 to 50m
today.
Sheep farming is hard work, and modern New Zealand farmers prefer to work
their farms on their own. A third of a present day farm may now consist of
radiata pine forests which require minimal care. Unlike other farm
endeavours, there are taxpayer incentives to encourage forestry.
The rise in wool prices since January has been cheering, as has the steady
reduction in the stockpile. This stood at 655,000 bales in 1991 when the
Wool Board decided it could no longer support the market. The magnitude of
the stockpile initially depressed prices. But it should all have been sold
by next year. The stockpile has fallen to 190,000 bales
The wool season began last July with low demand and prices averaging around
NZDollars 3.75 a kilo. However, prices have risen by around NZDollars 1
since February, helped by stronger demand from Britain, which has emerged as
the second biggest buyer. The UK increased its purchases by 41 per cent in
the nine months to March.
China and Hong Kong remain the biggest buyers, using New Zealand wools in a
range of products from hand knitting to tufted carpet.
In recent weeks, lamb prices have fallen in Europe, the main market. This
has caused some concern to exporters as prices had been unusually buoyant
for the previous 18 months. There is optimism that consumption will recover
towards the end of the year.
Beef exporters have continued to struggle with protectionist measures in the
major markets, Canada and the US, over the past year. However, some newer
markets were developed in Asia, notably Korea, as well as in Mexico.
The strong New Zealand dollar, and intense competition from Europe and
Australia on world markets, has depressed returns from dairying. The
industry is confident that prices will improve markedly over the coming
months. Even so, farmers are expected to receive a payout of NZDollars 2.85
a kilo of milkfat this season, 45 cents lower than last.
A series of freak hailstorms - none of which lasted more than a few minutes
 -destroyed the hopes and incomes of many apple-growers. Thanks to the warm
summer, the fruit was in the best condition for many years. After the
buoyant prices of 1992, world prices remain low, although the New Zealand
Apple and Pear Board is proud that Kiwi apples still fetch a premium on
major markets.
The kiwifruit industry is recovering from the massive losses it incurred in
1992. Production is down sharply, and quality up: leading to hopes that
there will be good markets for the fruit overseas.

FT  08 JUN 94 / Survey of New Zealand (1): Disillusion opens the door to
minor parties - Impatience with some aspects of the social overhaul of
recent years was a factor in the people's vote to change the electoral
system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
It is hard not to notice the tensions that pervade modern New Zealand. On
the one hand, the country wears all the trappings of a successful,
market-oriented society. Wellington, Auckland and other main cities are
well-supplied with stylish restaurants and smart boutiques. Warehouses are
being converted to 'Manhattan-style' apartments. Cellular phones are
everywhere.
As Mr Roderick Deane, chief executive at NZ Telecom, the country's largest
quoted company, puts it: 'New Zealand, in a sense, has rejoined the rest of
the world over the past decade.'
On the other hand, memories of a very different social structure, which
offered New Zealanders 'cradle-to-grave' protection under a universal
welfare system, linger on. It is 10 years since the nation embarked on
radical economic reform, first under a Labour government, which deregulated
financial markets and began to dismantle the extensive state sector, and
then under the National party, which extended the 'free market' philosophy
to the industrial relations arena and the welfare system.
But the implications of this social overhaul are still permeating the lives
of ordinary New Zealanders. As a result, discontent with some of the less
palatable aspects of the new order - especially in the welfare and
employment areas - is highly visible.
In recent months, for example, attempts to alter work practices have brought
a rash of strikes, notably among recent privatisation candidates, such as NZ
Rail and NZ Telecom. Pensioners have marched in protest against
asset-testing for long-stay hospital patients. Student rebellion has
simmered over a threatened increase in tertiary education fees.
On the political front, there has already been a backlash. In a referendum
last November, a disillusioned electorate, unable to spot much difference
between the policies of the two biggest parties, voted to change the
nation's electoral system. Out went the British-style 'first past the post'
(FPP) method of electing constituency-based MPs to the single-chamber
parliament. In, for all future elections, came a 'mixed member proportional'
(MPP) system, a form of proportional representation modelled loosely on the
German system.
(En route, in the accompanying general election held under the existing FPP
rules, voters also returned a hung parliament. However, this situation was
resolved fairly speedily when a recount in marginal seats gave the ruling
National Party a slender majority).
The implications of a vote for MPP were clear. The new system is likely to
give minor parties a much greater voice in parliament, and thus encourage
coalition government. In addition, because only half the MPs sitting in the
enlarged 120-member parliament will represent specific constituencies, with
the remainder being drafted in from party lists, MMP will probably mean that
politicians' loyalty to the two major parties diminishes.
While the practical adjustments necessary to conduct an MMP election will
not be complete until next spring, there are already signs that the number
of 'serious' minor parties is about proliferate. Going into the November
general election, voters had two main choices outside Labour and National:
Mr Jim Anderton's Alliance, which is a coalition of five left-leaning minor
parties, and New Zealand First, headed by Mr Winston Peters, a former
National Party cabinet minister.
Now there is talk of a breakaway centre-left party, possibly headed by Mike
Moore, the former Labour party leader. On the right of the political
spectrum, some observers suggest that the National party could splinter into
about three groupings. The Association of Consumers and Taxpayers, a
free-market ginger group formed by Sir Roger Douglas, the former Labour
finance minister, could also emerge as a political force.
The big question is whether this fascinating but fluid political situation
is likely to have an important bearing on New Zealand's economic policies in
the months and years ahead.
At macroeconomic level, there is no decrying New Zealand's recent progress.
Growth in gross domestic product reached 4.6 per cent in calender 1993, and
many forecasts suggest that the year-on-year figure could top 5 per cent
this year. Unemployment, while still high, has eased.
The government is widely tipped to produce a small financial surplus for
1993-4 when it unveils its annual budget in the next few weeks.
On the inflation front, New Zealand now has the advantage of its
much-vaunted Reserve Bank Act, which formally insulates the central monetary
authority from political influence. It is merely required to ensure that
inflation says within a publicly-stated band, currently zero to 2 per cent.
The international financial community's approval for New Zealand's recent
performance has been clear from the foreign investment data. Direct net
investment inflow in the year to end-March reached NZDollars 4.7bn, more
than twice the level of the previous 12 months. Anecdotally, there are
indications that the country has been winning corporate dollars at the
expense of Australia, its larger neighbour, whose own reform process has
been much more measured.
It is true that a few question-marks persist. Some commentators would like
to see quicker progress in reducing the heavy external debt burden and the
current account deficit. The recent collapse of the large Fortex
meat-processing business - which had been hailed as a prize example of a
revitalised, efficient company - also cast an ominous shadow. It can be
argued that this was efficient rationalisation in an industry with surplus
capacity; but some observers saw Fortex as a symptom of inherent instability
in a key sector, and of serious under-capitalisation.
Many commentators also think the Reserve Bank, whose independence was
guaranteed just as worldwide recession began, has yet to face the challenge
of maintaining a low price-increase regime when international inflationary
conditions are less clement.
But the bigger, and more speculative, clouds that threaten this sunny
economic outlook are political. Advocates of the economic reforms scent two
specific dangers: a change in Reserve Bank targets, and a big change/repeal
of the Employment Contracts Act (ECA), the legislation which deregulated
labour markets but was criticised subsequently by the International Labour
Organisation in Geneva. Amendments to the latter, it is argued, could dent
business confidence immediately and, in the longer-term, affect labour costs
and productivity.
On both scores, changes are already being mooted. All three parties, apart
from the National, are talking of revisions to the ECA, while Labour has
suggested a widening of the Reserve Bank's inflation target range. If
changes come, the test may be whether the variations are largely cosmetic,
or whether they represent a fundamental shift.
Finally, it is worth noting that Mr Bolger's National government seems to
have adopted a less rigid approach since the last election. Much of the
reform process had, admittedly, been completed. Nevertheless, in recent
months, the government has introduced a minimum youth wage, held off on
further state housing rent increases and set up a 'taskforce' to look at
unemployment issues.
Whether this softer approach, coupled with the general economic recovery,
will allay the electorate's concerns remains to be seen. As Anne Knowles,
deputy chief executive of the New Zealand Employers Federation, says: 'MMP
has great potential to be disruptive, or it has great potential to be
stabilising - because no one can agree to do anything.' New Zealanders can
only wait to find out.

FT  08 JUN 94 / Survey of New Zealand (2): Business more confident than for
22 years - Nikki Tait reviews the economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Taken at face-value, the New Zealand economy is going great guns. Growth is
reckoned to have reached 4.6 per cent in 1993, one of the fastest rates
clocked up by any western economy - and nicely exceeding the 4 per cent
registered by Australia, the country's nearest neighbour and largest trading
partner.
Economic activity in the final quarter of 1993 alone was estimated to have
been 5.1 per cent higher than in the same three months a year earlier. Most
analysts expect some further progress, perhaps taking the year-on-year
growth rate to over 5 per cent later in 1994, and then several years of
sustainable growth at around 3.5 per cent.
Business confidence, according to the New Zealand Institute of Economic
Research, is at its highest since 1972, with a net 64 per cent of companies
questioned in the latest April survey expecting an improvement in the
general business situation over the next six months.
Even unemployment, a more problematic marker, has shown some improvement
recently. It remains painfully high at around 9.1 per cent, but has at least
fallen fairly sharply from rates of over 11 per cent seen in early-1992.
Finally, New Zealand has low inflation locked in for the immediate future by
the Reserve Bank of New Zealand Act, which guarantees the bank's
independence from political machinations, and requires it to administer
monetary policy to achieve a specified inflation target - currently from
zero to 2 per cent.
While nobody quibbles about this rosy short-term situation, opinions become
more divided when pundits are required to look ahead. On the minus side,
there are worries stemming from New Zealand's fluid political situation, and
from some niggling economic question-marks. On the plus side, there could be
some significant bullish factors influencing the economy in the medium term
 -not least, the consequences flowing from the recent conclusion of the
Uruguay Round in the Gatt negotiations late last year.
Most of the pessimists' anxieties centre on the external accounts. A current
account deficit of NZDollars 969m in the final quarter of 1993 took the
figure for the calendar year to NZDollars 1.65bn - some NZDollars 22m worse
than in 1992. This means that the current account deficit is running at
around 2 per cent of gross domestic product, a number which the Reserve
Bank, for one, thinks will persist for the next few years.
Combined with New Zealand's heavy, lingering net external debt, the lack of
speedy improvement on this score causes some concern. Last month, for
example, Standard &amp; Poor's decided against an upgrading of New Zealand's
'AA-' foreign currency debt rating. 'Good news on the growth, unemployment
and fiscal fronts does not, of itself, constitute a case for re-rating the
country,' commented the ratings agency.
'In New Zealand's case, much depends upon progress in improving the
country's external accounts beyond the improvement already factored into the
current rating. . . New Zealand's current account deficit and external
accounts have only slowly improved in recent years. . . Most notably, the
country's net external debt is still currently of the order of 175 per cent
of exports, only fractionally down from the 180 per cent figure at the time
of the last downgrade (January 1990).'
A second, and much more speculative worry, is the political one. It is
impossible to predict that this stage what kind of government the new
electoral system, based on a form of proportional representation, will
produce. But if a coalition government with a more 'left-leaning' bent were
to come into office, two possible institutional changes could affect New
Zealand's inflation record - or, at least, cause financial markets to fear
such an impact.
The first would be a repeal of - or major amendments to - the 1991
Employment Contracts Act (ECA), NZ's controversial labour market legislation
which opened the way for individual employee contracts, overthrowing the
previous centralised, award-based system. The second would be any tinkering
with the Reserve Bank targets.
At present, it should be stressed, these doubts do not appear to weigh
heavily in investors' minds. Although there was some temporary upheaval to
both share and bond markets and to the NZ dollar after the November election
result, the dust settled quickly. And while some analysts scent a slight
upturn in inflationary pressures, which could push the inflation rate closer
to the upper end of the 0-2 per cent range, New Zealand's 10-year bond rates
are well below those of Australia and roughly in line with those of the US.
Moreover, Mr Donald Brash, the Reserve Bank governor is quick to stress that
the Labour party's suggested amendment to the inflation target - from zero
to two, to minus one to three - could have a limited effect.
'That quite explicitly leaves the median unchanged, so it isn't obvious that
one would run monetary policy very differently,' he comments. 'If the median
of the target remains at one, which our best understanding of what price
stability is, allowing for biases in the (consumer prices) index, then the
debate about whether its 1 per cent either side of 1, or 2 per cent, is to
some extent a debate about what excuses are allowed for in the contract.'
By this, he means external price shocks - a hike in energy prices, say  - or
a temporary domestically-induced increase through a rise in indirect taxes,
for example. As Mr Brash points out, 'It's a pretty technical argument.' But
whether the markets would interpret any widening of the target range in such
a kindly light, remains to be seen.
Again, with the ECA, it is hard to anticipate the impact of any changes,
without seeing details of the alterations proposed. Groups like the New
Zealand Employers' Federation remained firmly opposed to any tinkering with
the act, warning of the impact on business confidence. Privately, however,
some executives suggest that modest - and probably largely cosmetic -
changes now might be acceptable, if this ensured the act's long-term
survival.
In contrast to these minus points, there are a couple of potential factors
which could play in New Zealand's favour. For a start, there is the apparent
strength of the Australian economy - which grew at around 4 per cent in 1993
and is tipped to go higher still. Despite the two countries' traditional
rivalry and common desire to develop links with Asia, Australia is still New
Zealand's biggest trading partner, accounting for about one-fifth of
exports. If Australian consumer spending continues to rebound, and
government forecasts of a strong revival in business investment are correct,
New Zealand manufacturers stand to benefit.
Finally, the impact of the Gatt talks should not be overlooked. Economists
at ANZ Bank in Wellington, for example, have noted that the settlement
should underpin agricultural commodity prices over the coming year, and
improve market access. While they warn that no simplistic conclusions should
be drawn from the GATT deal, and note that much depends on how the details
of the agreement pan out, they also point out that almost two-thirds of New
Zealand's exports are still agriculture-based.
'Consequently, New Zealand stands to benefit substantially from the
successful Gatt outcome,' they conclude. 'It is suggested that the gains for
New Zealand could include increases averaging 17 per cent in the prices our
exporters receive for meat and dairy products. Optimistic estimates hint at
gains for New Zealand totalling NZDollars 1.5bn a year in additional export
revenues'.

FT  08 JUN 94 / Government Bonds: Retreat by bunds drags European prices
lower
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN and GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
German government bond prices were again on the retreat yesterday, driving
other European markets down with them, as fresh data pointing to strong
economic growth reinforced fears that interest rates in Germany have reached
their low point in the current cycle.
West German gross domestic product grew 0.5 per cent in the first quarter,
or 2.1 per cent year-on-year, suggesting that economic growth is exceeding
economists' expectations. The data follows the recent upward revision of
growth by the OECD, which now has a target of 1.8 per cent for the
pan-German economy this year.
However, Mr Ken Wattret, an international economist at Midland Global
Markets, said that traders had ignored some positive elements for the
market. 'We believe the recovery is export-led, so the Bundesbank will
continue to support the recovery with rate cuts,' he said, adding that the
detailed figures back up this view.
However, the negative reaction to the data also reflects the generally
bearish sentiment overhanging European bond markets. The German market
failed to take any comfort from the downward revision of M3 money supply in
April to 15.4 from the 15.8 per cent. Dealers said that unemployment data
was ignored by the market, as it is not strictly relevant to the interest
rate outlook.
The September German bund future on Liffe ended down 0.32 point at 92.27.
UK government bonds showed further weakness yesterday in a continuation of
the trend seen in recent weeks.
With no new economic data published yesterday analysts saw no reason for
investors to change their view of the market's prospects, and gilts drifted
lower with other European markets.
'The underlying sentiment is still shot to bits,' said one analyst. 'Most
institutional fund managers are optimistic but that is a long way from being
willing to put money into the market. They don't want to take that risk.'
Traders reported some profit-taking and said that there was disappointment
that no further headway had been made after the rally last week.
'Quite a lot of money was spent last week and the UK rallied more than the
other European markets. It was oversold and it's now reached fair value,
which means that prop has gone now,' said Mr Bob Dobson, head of gilt sales
at Daiwa Europe.
Analysts said today's industrial production figures and the outcome of the
European elections would be important for gilts.
'If the Tories do slightly better than expected, then the market may get a
bit of a boost,' said Mr Ian Shepherdson, UK economist at Midland Global
Markets. The long gilt future was down 1 3/32 point at 100 5/8 in late
trading.
French government bonds moved slightly lower yesterday in trading dominated
by movements in the German bond market.
Analysts said sentiment still remained negative. 'Both France and Germany
are cheap but we are still going to see continued selling,' said one trader.
Mr Julian Callow, an economist at Kleinwort Benson, said that tomorrow's
industrial production figures and consumer price data due on Friday could
provide further signs of strengthening economic recovery.
US Treasury bonds drifted lower in light trading yesterday as the market
paused after a two-session rally.
Late in the day, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  11/32 at 87
27/32 , with the yield rising to 7.251 per cent. At the short end, the
two-year note was unchanged at 100 3/16 , to yield 5.755 per cent.
Early on, prices moved modestly lower as traders followed through on a
weakening trend in overnight trading of US securities in Tokyo.
During mid-morning, bonds gradually clawed their way back, though there was
no new economic news or overriding technical conditions to guide the
activity. Action in the commodity and foreign exchange markets was generally
featureless, but not unfavourable. Still, prices ebbed for a second time
near midday and held fast at the lower levels during the afternoon.
The next significant event on the economic calendar is the release of May
producer price data on Friday, followed by consumer price figures next
Monday. Tame readings on inflation are expected in both reports.
Economists are forecasting a 0.2 per cent increase in the PPI, following a
slight decline the previous month.

FT  08 JUN 94 / International Capital Markets: Chase gains equity trade
powers in US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Chase Manhattan has become the latest bank to be given the power to
underwrite and trade equities in the US, marking a further erosion of the
barriers that have kept commercial banks out of the investment banking
business.
Like others, though, Chase has no ambitions to grow a large-scale securities
business quickly, and is anyway severely limited in its ability to
underwrite and trade securities. Under Federal Reserve rules, only 10 per
cent of its securities subsidiary's income can come from these activities.
Chase's cautious approach in the US has also been shaped by its disastrous
experience in the UK, where it suffered big losses after acquiring local
brokers Simon &amp; Coates and Laurie Millbank in the mid-1980s.
'In the UK, we tried to build a stand-alone investment bank,' said Mr Paul
Brandow, president of Chase Securities in the US and a former head of
Chase's UK securities business. 'It never got integrated into the rest of
the bank.' The plan in the US, by contrast, is to use the securities powers
to raise money for existing customers of the bank, he said.
Like a handful of other US banks, Chase has already used its powers to
underwrite and trade debt securities to engage in the sub-investment grade
bond business. It has also been among the most active US banks in bringing
issuers from developing countries to the US markets. The equity powers will
be used to extend activities for these types of issuer, said Mr Brandow.
Chase is the sixth US commercial bank to be given equity powers.

FT  08 JUN 94 / International Capital Markets: Hellenic Republic loan to pay
Libor plus 80
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Hellenic Republic disclosed yesterday that the annual interest rate on
its forthcoming five-year Dollars 500m syndicated loan will be 80 basis
points over the London interbank offered rate (Libor).
The average life of the loan, Greece's first in four years and the first
under its new sovereign name, is about 4 1/4 years since it will have to
start repaying the loan in equal semi-annual instalments after three years.
Thirteen banks have underwritten the loan on an equal basis: The Bank of
Tokyo, Chase Investment Bank, Citibank International, Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank,
Fuji Bank, Hill Samuel Bank, Lloyds Bank Capital Markets, Mitsubishi Bank,
JP Morgan Securities, NatWest Capital Markets, Sanwa Bank, Sumitomo Bank and
Union Bank of Switzerland.
Greece will not be paying a commitment fee on the loan since it is expected
to draw down the whole amount within one month of the signing. Syndication
started on Monday and is expected to close on or before June 24.
Participation fees are: senior lead managers (Dollars 20m and above) 1.35
per cent; lead managers (Dollars 15m to Dollars 19.5m) 1.25 per cent;
managers (Dollars 10m to Dollars 14.5m) 1.2 per cent; co-managers (Dollars
5m to Dollars 9.5m) 1.10 per cent; participants (Dollars 1m to Dollars 4.5m)
1 per cent.

FT  08 JUN 94 / International Bonds: Ontario offering may have pricing
concession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Province of Ontario is expected to make some concession on pricing in
order to ensure a successful launch for its first global offering of its new
fiscal year. The issue, which could emerge today, is expected to raise
around Dollars 1bn and have a maturity of 10 years.
Syndicate managers reported only muted interest in the deal, due to
Ontario's frequent presence in the market and its recent downgrading. As a
result, the price talk centred around 65 to 67 basis points over 10-year
Treasuries, even though Ontario's outstanding dollar bonds were trading at a
yield spread of around 63 basis points in the secondary market.
Salomon Brothers, which has been appointed joint bookrunner with Goldman
Sachs, with RBC Dominion as joint lead manager, said the lack of a 10-year
eurodollar benchmark would increase the attraction of Ontario's deal. There
have been few eurodollar offerings with a 2004 maturity due to the
volatility in the financial markets this year.
Advance Bank Australia, a building society-turned-bank operating mainly in
New South Wales, made its first appearance in the eurobond market yesterday
with a Dollars 250m offering of floating-rate notes due 1999. The discounted
margin on the notes was 40 basis points over Libor. Lead manager JP Morgan
said the bonds were selling well, reflecting the extensive pre-marketing
efforts and the bank's positive credit outlook. The bonds were kept in
syndicate overnight.
Elsewhere, a rise in the Canadian dollar and continued currency arbitrage
opportunities prompted a further supply of short-dated Canadian issues
yesterday as SNCF and Swedish Export Credit raised a total of Dollars 250m
through offerings of five-year and three-year Eurobonds respectively.
Investors were attracted by the relatively high coupons on both issues, the
proceeds of which were believed to have been swapped into floating-rate
dollars.
Argentina's Banco de la Ciudad de Buenos Aires will issue a sixth Dollars
20m tranche of six-month notes under its two-year Dollars 100m
euro-commercial paper programme. West Merchant Bank and Banco Medefin are
dealers for the programme.

FT  08 JUN 94 / International Capital Markets: Moody's cuts BNP senior debt
rating
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Moody's has lowered the debt rating of Banque Nationale de Paris and placed
Societe Generale's debt under review for possible downgrade.
BNP's senior debt rating, which had been under review since January 14,
dropped from Aa1 to Aa3. The agency said the cut was based on a belief that
BNP's profitability and economic capitalisation would be challenged for some
time by asset-quality stress, competition among banks and low credit demand.
Moody's said any SocGen downgrade would 'probably be minor'.
The Aa3 long-term debt rating of the Industrial Bank of Japan has been
placed under review for possible downgrade by Moody's.

FT  08 JUN 94 / International Company News: Apple in panel display move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Apple Computer is to collaborate with a small US manufacturer of flat panel
displays, OIS Optical Imaging Systems, to develop displays for Apple's next
generation of notebook computers.
OIS will be the first US manufacturer to supply active matrix liquid crystal
displays to the computer industry. Sharp, of Japan is the dominant world
supplier of these displays which are used in avionics and a variety of
electronic instruments.
OIS, an affiliate of Guardian Industries, plans to build the first US high
volume manufacturing facility for active matrix flat panel displays at a
cost of around Dollars 400m.
The agreement with Apple follows a recent announcement by the US
administration of an initiative to boost US flat panel display
manufacturing. The Dollars 600m initiative, which includes incentives for
companies that are establishing display manufacturing operations in the US
has yet to be funded.
OIS plans to seek government support for research and development through
the Commerce Department's Technology Redevelopment Programme (TRP).
Apple, which currently purchases flat panel displays from Japan, said that
it may support OIS in its application for TRP. 'We would like to see a US
supply base,' for flat panel displays, Apple said.
However, the agreement with Apple and plans for expanded manufacturing were
not prompted by the government move, said Mr Ralph Gerson, chairman of OIS.
In the first phase of its agreement with Apple, OIS will develop a new,
high-performance active matrix display to Apple's specifications and deliver
prototype displays.

The deposit, named Redoubtable, lies beneath shallow lake sediments on Lake
Lefroy at Kambalda. WMC said the deposit was modest. Evaluation drilling was
under way.
However, the Melbourne-based company added that the potential existed for an
open-pit resource of about 1m tonnes, at a grade of four grams per tonne.
Mr John Ralph, chief executive of CRA, the Australian mining group in which
RTZ of the UK holds a 49 per cent stake, is to retire on June 24 - four
months earlier than announced.
CRA has outlined succession plans. Mr Leon Davis, CRA's mining director,
takes over as chief executive. Mr Ralph will become a non-executive director
and deputy chairman.
Mr Ralph's retirement 'follows review and discussion to ensure there will be
no negative effect on the company'.

Daewoo, the South Korean industrial group, is planning a joint venture car
assembly plant in India as part of an developing world expansion in its
motor division.
The venture, with DCM-Toyota, received Indian government approval last week,
and will begin production next year.
The new company, to be renamed DCM-Daewoo, will be capitalised at Dollars
200m, with Daewoo holding a controlling 51 per cent stake.
Daewoo will renovate the production lines at DCM-Toyota's plant in Noida
City, which will assemble kits of Daewoo's LeMans Racer. Initial production
will be 25,000 vehicles, but will increase to 50,000.
Daewoo is focusing on the developing world to achieve rapid growth for its
car division, although it is also planning to market cars in western Europe
in 1995 and the US a year later.
It is planning joint venture car assembly plants in the Philippines,
Vietnam, Uzbekistan and Romania, all of which are expected to go into
operation in 1995 or 1996.
The strategy is part of Daewoo's plans to quadruple car output to 2.2m
vehicles by 2000, with almost half the production to be located abroad.
Several of the world's leading carmakers are seeking a foothold in the
Indian auto industry.
The US's General Motors, the world's biggest vehicle maker, is to start car
production in India in a venture with Hindustan Motors. It is making an
investment of around Dollars 100m.
The GM venture will assemble the Opel Astra, its best-selling car in Europe,
and will have capacity to produce about 20,000 cars a year on two shifts
starting late next year.
Production will be located at an existing Hindustan Motors facility at
Halol, near Vadodara in the state of Gujarat.
Mercedes-Benz of Germany, meanwhile, is to take 51 per cent in a joint
venture with Tata Engineering and Locomotive (Telco). They plan to build up
to 20,000 Mercedes-Benz E-Class executive cars a year.

<TEXT>
Bangkok Bank, Thailand's largest commercial bank, has taken the unusual step
of issuing a four-month financial report soon after reporting an unusual
decline in first-quarter earnings. The latest report shows a 12 per cent
advance in net profits against a year ago.
Bangkok was the only one of Thailand's leading banks to report a decline in
first-quarter net profits, down 5 per cent at Bt3.45bn (Dollars 136.7m).
'We think they wanted to set the record straight, having lost face with
their first-quarter results. They seem to have had a colossal April,' said
HG Asia's country manager, Mr George Morgan.
The quarterly profits fall was blamed partly on the fact that Bt1.5bn of
unaccrued interest receivables were injected into the first-quarter 1993
result.
The bank's executive vice-chairman, Mr Damrong Krishnamara, said net profits
for the first four months of this year were Bt5.5bn, compared with Bt4.87bn
a year ago.
This shows the bank made profits of Bt1.92bn in April alone, representing 65
per cent year-on-year growth for that month. It suggests the bulk of Bt806m
in unaccrued interest receivable from a motorway contract was taken in
April. Mr Damrong said the bank's total deposits were 10.2 per cent higher
than a year ago, at Bt568.3bn, at the end of April.
Early this year, the bank's president, Mr Vichit Surapongchai - number four
in the bank's decision-making hierarchy - left suddenly.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, the US drugs company, jumped 11 per cent
early yesterday on a statement from majority owner Rhone-Poulenc of France
that it is considering alternatives that include a sale of the business.
The news came after last month's purchase of Syntex, another US drugs group,
by Roche of Switzerland. The deal sparked speculation about other drugs
company deals.
RPR said in a filing with the US's Securities and Exchange Commission, that
its French parent was considering 'several alternative transactions
involving RPR . . . including transactions relating to business
combinations, mergers or transfers or assets of securities involving RPR'.
The statement was made in connection with a standstill agreement signed by
Rhone Poulenc when it acquired the majority interest in Rorer in 1990. Under
that, the French company agreed not to raise its stake until after July 31,
1997.
The French group owns 68.34 per cent of RPR and can only change the terms
with the support of a majority of RPR's non-executive directors.
In New York, the news pushed RPR shares up Dollars 3 1/2 to close at Dollars
38 5/8 .
RPR's sales have been static as a result of pressure from buyers to reduce
drugs costs, particularly in the US. The company's income was depressed in
dollar terms as 72 per cent of its sales are made abroad.
RPR's sales in its first quarter were down 5 per cent from a year before, at
Dollars 870m.

FT  08 JUN 94 / International Company News: IBM seeks lifting of decree
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IBM aims to persuade the US courts to lift restrictions on its computer
services business imposed in a 1956 anti-trust consent decree. The decree
forces IBM to separate its US 'outsourcing' business, which manages computer
centres on behalf of customers, from other operations.
IBM lawyers discussed the consent decree with a New York Federal judge
yesterday, but have not filed any motions with the court, IBM said. The
consent decree arose from a 1952 government complaint which alleged IBM had
monopolised the market for tabulating machines, the precursor to the
electronic computer.
The terms of the decree include orders that IBM must operate its 'service
bureaux' business as a separate wholly-owned subsidiary and that the
subsidiary must pay for IBM computer equipment and software on the same
terms as its competitors in the service business.
IBM is also restricted in its sales of used computer equipment by the
decree. IBM may only acquire used computers when they are traded in or
exchanged for credit on new equipment. The company must then go through a
60-day listing and remarketing procedure before it is allowed to sell the
used equipment.
'We think the decree operates to the disadvantage of customers by
artificially raising our costs and preventing us from passing on to our
customers the benefits of our integrated operations in marketing, services,
manufacturing and development,' IBM said. 'The information technology
industry of today bears no resemblance to the infant industry of 1956,' said
an IBM spokesman. While the decree applied originally to tabulating machines
it is now being interpreted to apply to computers.
IBM's efforts to modify the decree's terms could raise opposition from
rivals such as Electronic Data Systems. It also may draw some from reseller
firms, which have benefited from IBM's restraints.

<TEXT>
The Tribune Company, the Chicago-based newspaper publisher and entertainment
concern, has purchased North America's largest farm publication, The Farm
Journal. Terms were not disclosed.
The acquisition is expected to enhance the Tribune's farm radio broadcast
network and provide programming for its on-line computer information
services.
The Farm Journal is privately held. It comes out 13 times a year, and has
175 full-time workers, including 45 reporters and editors. Circulation is
around 700,000, taking in publications such as Top Producer, Beef Today and
Hogs Today.
The company also maintains a detailed database of demographic information on
farm operations, and owns a market research firm specialising in
agricultural topics.
The Tribune, which publishes Chicago's leading newspaper, has a reputation
as an urban news organisation. However, its vast radio network reaches deep
into midwest farm communities.
'Farm Journal and Tribune share a commitment to serving the agricultural
community, and a vision for developing new products and services for farmers
and advertisers,' said Mr James Dowdle, president of Tribune Broadcasting
company.
'Our combined resources offer a strong base to explore new opportunities in
electronic publishing, television programming, database and other advertiser
services, additional print titles and, of course, radio,' Mr Dowdle said.

   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Huhtamaki, the Finnish confectionery, food packaging and
pharmaceuticals group, fell 10 per cent yesterday after it produced
lower-than-expected profits in the first four months.
Taxable profits increased by 4 per cent to FM112m (Dollars 20.4m), sharply
lower than the FM150m profit anticipated by the market.
The shares fell to FM189 from FM210.
'People have got used to a big increase in Huhtamaki's profits and this
slowdown was not expected,' an analyst said.
The performance reflected a slight improvement in operating profit, which
rose to FM163m from FM161m, and a small reduction in financial costs to
FM51m from FM53m.
Sales were up 13 per cent at FM2.7bn. Much of the growth derived from
acquisitions which lifted the European sales of the Leaf confectionery
business and Polarcup packaging.
This helped to compensate for a downturn in Leaf's North American operations
and a stronger markka.
Mr Timo Peltola, chief executive, said the group had a sluggish winter but
market prospects for the rest of the year were slowly improving. Leaf, the
world's 10th largest confectionery group, is expected to win market share in
North America while Polarcup's business is forecast to pick up during the
summer.

FT  08 JUN 94 / International Company News: Ina takes the privatisation
trail - The sale of 51 per cent of the insurance group will be Italy's
largest disposal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
After a pause for mould-breaking general elections, the Italian
privatisation show hit the road again yesterday.
Less than three weeks after a parliamentary vote of confidence in Italy's
new right-wing government, the Italian Treasury published the prospectus for
the sale of up to 51 per cent of the Ina insurance group, which claims a
bigger market share than any of its private-sector rivals in Italian life
and non-life business.
The price for Ina shares will not be set until June 25, two days before the
retail offer is launched, but the Treasury has confirmed that it will be
between L2,200 and L2,700 a share, valuing the whole company at
L8,800bn-L10,800bn (Dollars 5.4bn-Dollars 6.7bn). That will make Ina the
biggest privatisation attempted by the Italian state, although it is almost
certain to be dwarfed within a year by the sale of state-owned holdings in
Stet, the telecommunications group, Enel, the electricity utility and Eni,
the energy and chemicals group.
One challenge for Ina and its advisers is maintaining the momentum of
investor interest. This was seen in the previous sales of the financial
groups, Imi, Credito Italiano and Banca Commerciale Italiana (BCI).
Domestically and internationally, both Stet - already a quoted company  -
and Eni are better known. They are politically sensitive, which means they
attract more media interest than Ina has in its 82-year history.
That said, the Ina sale is not short on technical and political innovation.
The last two public offers - of BCI and Credito Italiano - were criticised,
after allies of Mediobanca, the Milan merchant bank, installed their
nominees on the board.
New restrictions in the Ina sale will prevent such manoeuvring by treating
investors linked through other companies' shareholder syndicates as though
they are acting in concert. Together, such investors will not be able to buy
more than 5 per cent of Ina. In addition, small shareholders' nominees will
have seats reserved for them on the board, offsetting the dominance of large
institutions, a trend likely to be continued.
Mr Lorenzo Pallesi, Ina's chairman since 1990, and a former head of
Prudential's Italian operations, believes a similar Mediobanca-inspired raid
on the Ina board is unlikely.
In any case, he will have enough on his plate bringing the group up to the
same levels of efficiency as its competitors, without having to worry about
boardroom in-fighting. Ina has been totally owned and managed by the state
since 1912, and benefited from compulsory contributions from other insurance
companies, until last year.
'Some other insurance companies are probably operationally more profitable
than us,' admits Mr Pallesi, disarmingly. 'But our potential is much greater
than theirs.'
In particular, the group is hoping to take advantage of the opportunities in
Italy's underdeveloped life insurance sector.
Life insurance represents a comparatively low share of the overall Italian
market, because of generous state pension provisions. In 1992, for example,
life insurance accounted for 27 per cent of the Italian market, compared
with 66 per cent of the UK market. But increasing pressure on the Italian
pensions budget means life insurance and other linked savings products are
likely to be taken up as alternatives.
Ina still leads the sector - with an 18 per cent share at end-1992 - but has
watched its hold over the market decline over the last few years.
However, Ina believes it should be able to arrest the decline by revamping
its extensive distribution network of more than 7,000 sub-agents and sales
people throughout Italy and by tapping the fast-growing bancassurance sector
through an agreement with Banca di Roma, one of Italy's biggest banks, to
sell Ina's products through the bank's extensive network.
Over the last year, Ina has tried to counter disaffection amid the ranks of
its agents - most of whom are not employed directly by the company, but
concentrate exclusively on the sale of Ina products - by promoting younger
more dynamic sales people, changing about 25 per cent of the network.
At the same time, the company is to promote the links between its life
business and the sale of non-life products through its subsidiary,
Assitalia. According to the company, this should offset the handicap imposed
by new European Union regulations which prevent Ina and Assitalia from
taking the logical step of uniting into a composite insurer, along British
lines, just at the moment when EU liberalisation is increasing competition.
The board's second task, after restructuring the distribution network, will
be to attend to Ina's extensive property assets.
The group starts with the advantage that its owners at the Treasury have
allowed it to revalue the assets, which range from ordinary apartments to
the historic Palazzo Strozzi in Florence, more than doubling their book
value. If Ina sells some of its real estate - valued at just over L7,000bn -
it will only have to pay tax on the increase since the year-end revaluation.
Some analysts see the low yield on this property as evidence that the assets
have been overvalued, but at least this strong capitalisation should mean
that Mr Pallesi will be able to honour his pledge that no capital increases
will be attempted 'for the foreseeable future'.

FT  08 JUN 94 / International Company News: SMH sees modest improvement
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SMH, the leading watchmaking group, is looking for only modest profit growth
again this year, but has renewed confidence in the long-term prospects of
its core business.
Questions have been raised in recent months about the once fast-growing
group, known best for its Swatch plastic watches, following the stagnation
of sales last year and mixed reports about its diversification attempts into
telephones and a Swatch car. Its bearer shares have lost a third of their
value since last July.
Mr Nicolas Hayek, chairman, said the modest 7 per cent growth in net income
to SFr441m (Dollars 315m) last year after two years of double digit rises
was due mainly to a decision not to raise Swatch prices in countries whose
currencies fell against the Swiss franc.
The strength of the franc was a problem as the group did not want Swatch to
lose its low price identity, he said.
He dismissed suggestions that demand for Swatches was reaching saturation
point. US sales had been disappointing last year, but were improving. In
Germany, first-quarter unit sales were up 8.5 per cent.
Mr Hayek insisted that wrist watches would remain the group's core business,
and Swatch, with a third generation of models on the way, would play a vital
role in the volume sector.
The slow developing diversification into telephones was taking a new
direction into cordless sets. Mr Hayek said the group might acquire the
telephone set division of a leading telecoms manufacturer.
The joint venture with Daimler-Benz to develop an environmentally friendly
Swatch city car would not require any more than 30 per cent of SMH's cash
flow in the the next three or four years. The car would reach break-even
point three years after sales began, at the latest.

FT  08 JUN 94 / International Company News: Two Italian banks seek capital
injections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two of Italy's biggest banks have outlined plans for increases in capital.
Credito Italiano, recently privatised, is to ask shareholders for
authorisation to increase its capital by a nominal value of L2bn (Dollars
1.2m) over the next five years, through the issue of shares or a mixture of
shares and bonds.
Meanwhile, Cariplo, the Milan-based savings bank, has finalised plans for a
two-stage increase in capital which should raise more than L2,500bn for the
bank and allow the company to float a 22 per cent stake on the Milan stock
market. The first stage of the offer is likely to start on July 11.
Credito Italiano ended speculation about an imminent rights issue with a
statement yesterday convening an extraordinary meeting of shareholders at
the end of June to vote on a new authority.
Banca Commerciale Italiana, Italy's other recently privatised bank,
announced plans for a fully-fledged issue of shares and warrants last week,
to raise up to L2,362bn.
Banking sources said that Credito Italiano did not need to raise capital to
finance its own development over the next few years.
However, the group wants to be in a position to move quickly if there are
opportunities for acquisitions.
Cariplo announced in April that it was planning to float new shares in
Milan.
On Monday, the bank confirmed that a first tranche of 600m shares would be
issued at between L2,350 and L2,750, raising between L1,410bn and L1,650bn.
Institutional shareholders will be limited to a 3 per cent stake in the
company. The group has agreed to protect small shareholders' interests by
reserving certain seats on the board for their nominees, an idea borrowed
from the government's new rules for privatisation of the Ina insurance
group.
A second tranche, in the form of bonds and warrants, will be sold before
June 30, 1995, and should raise more than L1,000bn.

FT  08 JUN 94 / International Company News: Nestle may buy Volvo food unit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nestle, the Swiss food group yesterday confirmed its interest in buying
Branded Consumer Products, the food, drink and tobacco company which Volvo
wants to sell as part of a programme to focus on its vehicle businesses.
'We are interested in buying BCP. In fact we have started negotiations with
a view to a possible acquisition,' Mr Helmut Maucher, Nestle chairman said
in an interview with La Gaceta de los Negocios the Spanish business daily.
Volvo said Nestle was one of several groups which had shown an interest in
BCP, but it declined to identify the others.
BCP, which includes Swedish Match and some of Sweden's best-known food and
drinks brands, is the biggest single unit on Volvo's sale list and is
expected to raise more than SKr20bn (Dollars 2.5bn).
The consumer products group achieved first-quarter profits after financial
items of SKr296m on sales of SKr4.85bn.
Volvo holds 74 per cent of BCP and has launched a bid for the outstanding
shares. Its offer expires on Friday.
The vehicle group wants to gain 100 per cent control of BCP before it enters
detailed disposal talks.
BCP was formed in late 1993 after the break-up of Procordia, a drugs-to-food
group jointly controlled by the Swedish state and Volvo.

Amer, the Finnish consumer group, saw pre-tax profits rise by 76 per cent to
FM81m (Dollars 14.7m) in the first four months, in spite of a worse
performance from its Wilson sports unit and lower sales, writes Christopher
Brown-Humes.
Sales fell 5 per cent to FM2.57bn, reflecting a stronger markka, divestments
and a 6 per cent drop in Wilson's sales.

FT  08 JUN 94 / International Company News: Metra and Securitas plan
security system alliance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A plan to create one of Europe's leading companies in locking and access
control systems was yesterday unveiled by Metra, the Finnish industrial
group, and Securitas of Sweden.
Metra's Abloy Security division will merge with the Securitas Lock Group to
form Assa-Abloy AB, a company with SKr3.5bn (Dollars 443m) in annual sales
and 4,600 employees. The aim is to list the company on the Stockholm and
Helsinki stock exchanges next spring.
Metra said the merger would create a strong company, capable of expanding
and competing in Europe, due to synergy benefits and access to capital. It
will be Europe's biggest manufacturer of cylinder locks.
The arrangement enables Metra to focus on diesel engines and bathroom
ceramics, while allowing Securitas to concentrate on guard services and
alarm systems.
The Finnish company will initially hold 55 per cent of Assa-Abloy and will
receive a cash payment out of the new company to compensate for the size
difference between Abloy Security and Securitas Lock. Abloy had 1993 sales
of SKr2.5bn and a SKr46m profit, compared with profits of SKr78m on sales of
SKr1bn at Securitas Lock.
When the merged company is listed, Metra's holding is expected to fall to 40
per cent, but it will remain the largest single owner. This is because
Securitas intends to distribute its 45 per cent stake to shareholders in
what is effectively a demerger.
Securitas said its net debt would fall to nil from SKr400m giving it a
strong financial base from which to expand. It holds more than 5 per cent of
the European security market.
Assa-Abloy will be based in Stockholm and Mr Carl-Henric Svanberg, first
executive vice-president of Securitas, will be its first president and chief
executive.
The Nordic region will account for almost half of total sales, but the US
will be the largest single market with 1993 pro-forma sales of SKr860m.

FT  08 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Lack of exceptional costs boosts Norcros
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Norcros, the building materials and print and packaging group, reported a
substantial improvement in full year pre-tax profits reflecting higher
operating profits, the absence of exceptional losses and sharply reduced
interest costs.
Profits in the year to March 31 jumped to Pounds 17.1m from Pounds 2.63m,
restated for FRS 3. Turnover grew by 7.4 per cent to Pounds 378m (Pounds
352m) reflecting improvements in most markets.
The pre-tax figure was struck after a Pounds 1.35m exceptional gain relating
to the discontinuing property division. In the comparable period there was
an exceptional loss of Pounds 7.59m on property disposals, offset by an
earlier Pounds 4.5m provision.
Earnings per share of 6.6p compared with losses of 2.4p. The final dividend
is maintained at 3.5p making an unchanged total for the year of 7p, as
forecast at the time of the group's rights issue in June 1993. The shares
closed 6p higher at 139p.
Mr Michael Doherty, chairman, noted that the UK housing market showed signs
of growth last year while the commercial market continued to decline and
refurbishment expenditure fell slightly.
'Against this background, many of our businesses performed very well and a
majority of them produced improved sales and profits.'
Group operating profits, including a Pounds 4.11m (Pounds 2.1m) contribution
from associates, increased by 23 per cent to Pounds 24m (Pounds 19.4m.)
In the core building products division operating profits were flat at Pounds
5.9m on turnover of Pounds 165.5m (Pounds 152.5m.)
The restructured ceramics division, including associates, posted increased
profits of Pounds 9.2m (Pounds 5.6m) on turnover of Pounds 126m (Pounds
115.7m) while the print and packaging businesses lifted profits to Pounds
10.7m (Pounds 8.9m) on turnover of Pounds 109.9m (Pounds 101.9m.)
Net interest costs fell to Pounds 8.19m (Pounds 13.7m) as net borrowings
dropped from Pounds 120.2m to Pounds 68.7m representing gearing of 39.5 per
cent down from 94.8 per cent a year earlier. This reflected Pounds 19.4m of
property disposals and the successful rights issue last year.
COMMENT
Norcros' dividend payment, increased by last June's rights issue, remained
uncovered last year but that should be rectified this year as lower interest
costs, a slow improvement in operating margins and further property
portfolio sales help profits move ahead. However the management still has to
demonstrate that it can get to grips with the remaining building product
loss-makers and convert higher sales into more impressive margins. Pre-tax
profits of about Pounds 24m are expected this year producing earnings per
share of 8.8p. Although the shares have taken a tumble recently they are
still trading on a prospective multiple of 15.8 and look fairly priced.

FT  08 JUN 94 / UK Company News: VideoLogic joining market valued at up to
Pounds 83.9m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VideoLogic, the Hertfordshire-based multimedia company, is to be demerged
from its parent, Avesco, the broadcasting services company, and floated on
the Stock Exchange via a placing and offer valuing the company at between
Pounds 70.5m and Pounds 83.9m.
Avesco shareholders will receive one VideoLogic share for each Avesco share.
They will also have a preferential opportunity to participate in the
placing, which is expected to raise Pounds 21.5m of new money before
expenses.
Some Pounds 13m will be available to VideoLogic to fund research and
development into improved systems for full motion video on personal computer
displays.
Yesterday, Mr Richard Murray, Avesco chairman, said VideoLogic had been
transformed beyond recognition since it was acquired in 1989 and its
potential could best be exploited through a separate listing.
At the same time, Avesco announced results for the year to March 31, showing
revenues 4 per cent down at Pounds 22.5m (Pounds 23.4m) while losses rose
from Pounds 1.3m to Pounds 7.2m. Losses per share were 9p (2.2p) and the
dividend is passed. VideoLogic had sales of Pounds 9m and lost Pounds 5.6m.
Its results over the past three years have been hit by VideoLogic's
requirements for research funding, totalling almost Pounds 10m. Following
the demerger, Avesco is expected to have sales of Pounds 15m with pre-tax
profits initially of about Pounds 1m. The net asset value of the company
following the demerger will be about 18.5p a share.
The demerged VideoLogic's shares have not been priced. Warburgs, which is
underwriting the placing, will determine a price of between 55p and 70p
through book building.
The difference between the new money to be raised and available to the
company will be accounted for by expenses, repayment of borrowings and the
repayment of debt to Avesco.
Mr Derek Maclaren, VideoLogic chairman, and Mr Anthony Maclaren, managing
director, are entitled to a bonus from Avesco on demerger, but have agreed
to invest an aggregate Pounds 1.2m in VideoLogic shares, representing about
half the bonus after deducting Pounds 250,000 each and making allowance for
taxation.
Dealing in the shares will start on July 6.
Yesterday Avesco's shares fell 12p to 82p.

FT  08 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Ricardo gears up for Pounds 13.6m
acquisition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ricardo Group, the engin-eering consultancy, is to acquire the company that
built the transmissions for the Jaguar XJ220 and the factory Ford Escorts in
the world rally championship.
It is paying Pounds 13.6m for FF Developments, raising the money through a
rights issue at 130p. The issue of 10.5m shares at 1-for-3.07 is fully
underwritten by Hill Samuel Bank. Yesterday, Ricardo's shares closed 3p
lower at 162p.
FFD, which is based in Coventry and Detroit in the US, made pre-tax profits
of Pounds 1.58m last year on turnover of Pounds 16.5m, with the profits
divided equally between the US and UK. It is 49 per cent-owned by Chrysler
and 51 per cent by the Rolt family.
Mr Christopher Ross, Ricardo chairman, said yesterday that the group had
been looking for a sensible acquisition after organic growth of 25 per cent
in the automotive division for the past three years. FFD would broaden the
group's scope in the transmission and chassis engineering sectors,
complementing Ricardo's expertise on engines.
Ricardo has grown by selling its expertise on refining so-called NVH
(noise-vibration-harshness) to large motor manufacturers.
FFD's customers include Chrysler, which accounted for 45 per cent of the US
turnover, Ford, General Motors, Massey Ferguson, Volkswagen and Toyota.
The company has five divisions - chassis engineering, transmission
engineering, transmission assembly, limited slip differentials and an
engineering recruitment business. It was formed in 1971 by Maj Tony Rolt in
order to apply four wheel drive systems and anti-lock braking systems, which
the company pioneered.
Mr Stuart Rolt, chairman and chief executive of FFD since 1988, is receiving
Pounds 2.34m of his consideration in Ricardo shares, which he has agreed not
to sell for two years. He is also taking up a two-year service contract to
remain with the company.
At the interim stage Ricardo doubled pre-tax profits to Pounds 1.97m on
turnover of Pounds 30.1m. The board intends to recommend a final dividend of
4p (3.8p) on all shares in issue at the end of its financial year this
month.

growth
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ingham, the York-based motor parts, worsted spinning and property group,
reported profits of Pounds 1.91m for the year to March 31 on turnover of
Pounds 25.3m.
The car parts division contributed profits of Pounds 1.47m and turnover of
Pounds 19.2m despite the recession and a move to wholesale sales which cut
margins.
The company is seeking to expand the division through acquisitions.
In the previous period, for the 15 months to March 31 1993, group profits
were Pounds 838,000 on turnover of Pounds 11.2m. However, the two companies
making up the parts division were not acquired until September 1992 and May
1993.
The company said the spinning company enjoyed a much better year and
property was showing signs of improvement.
Earnings per share were 8.2p (8.9p). A proposed final dividend of 3.25p
makes a 5p total, against 6p for 15 months.

FT  08 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Apollo Metals in red but improvement seen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Apollo Metals, the aluminium distributor and processor, slipped into the red
during the six months ended March 31, after three successive years of
declining profits.
Pre-tax losses for this Birmingham-based company were Pounds 219,000,
compared with profits of Pounds 588,000, on turnover up slightly at Pounds
15.2m, against Pounds 14.6m. Losses per share were 2.2p, against earnings of
3p.
Acknowledging that Apollo, during its first half, had reached a low point in
its financial fortunes, Mr Leon Angrave, finance director since last March,
said: 'We're coming out the other side. Things are starting to look a lot
better for us.'
This is reflected in the decision to maintain the interim dividend at 1.2p.
Total payments last year were 3.6p.
For most of the first half, Apollo had to cope with low metal prices and
persistent pressure on margins as it acted to hold its market position. But
towards the end of the half there was a perceptible change in the market.
Demand increased and the producers, after capacity cuts last year, were
unable to meet it.
Importantly for Apollo its German subsidiary, whose expansion had been a
drain on resources, came into profit during April. But the cost of
reorganisation in Germany, which was Pounds 234,000 and taken as an
exceptional item, wiped out operating profit of Pounds 116,000 (Pounds
771,000).

FT  08 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Disposal helps St James Place Capital to
Pounds 81m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
St James's Place Capital, the financial services group run by Lord
Rothschild and Sir Mark Weinberg, yesterday announced a rise in pre-tax
profits from Pounds 12.3m to Pounds 81.1m for the year to March 1994.
The figures were distorted by a Pounds 26.5m profit from the disposal of its
stake in RIT Capital Partners last July, and from Pounds 26.8m investment
profits, due to what Sir Mark described as exceptionally favourable
conditions.
The company's fledgling life assurance and investment management businesses
also performed strongly and provided a more substantial recurrent income
base.
The company is paying a final dividend of 1.5p, making an unchanged total of
3p reflecting the reduction in group capital that followed the distribution
to shareholders of the 37.6 per cent stake in RIT.
Earnings per share amounted to 27.5p (5p) or 17.8p excluding the RIT
profits, while the net asset value per share rose by 29.6 per cent to 86.3p,
also adjusted for the RIT distribution, which reduced net assets by Pounds
111.6m.
SJP has an investment portfolio of about Pounds 160m, and this generated
substantial profits during the year, which are unlikely to be repeated.
In the second half of the year, SJP bought 80 per cent of International
Financial Markets Trading, the fund management group. The enlarged fund
management division, which also includes a 30 per cent stake in Global Asset
Management, contributed Pounds 27.7m in profit (Pounds 14.2m).
SJP's life assurance business, J Rothschild Assurance, brought in Pounds
250m in new premium income during 1993-94 and the current year figures are
'well ahead'.
Profits amounted to Pounds 11.7m. However, the management cautioned that
under the technical convention for the life insurance industry, of deducting
a notional rate of tax, the declared profit would have been reduced to
Pounds 7.3m.
Sir Mark said the group planned to reduce the importance of investment
profits, by building up financial services. It had set up a subsidiary which
plans to acquire and restructure existing life insurance companies.
In addition, SJP intends to build up its corporate finance activities,
through the 50 per cent owned J Rothschild Wolfensohn.
Investment banking lost Pounds 700,000 last year.

Schroders' new Japanese investment trust, the Schroder Japan Growth Fund,
has so far raised Pounds 88m from a placing of shares. Its initial size has
been capped at Pounds 125m, allowing a maximum of Pounds 37m to be raised
from a public offer, which opened yesterday and closes on June 30.
The fund, which will invest in a broad range of companies, is to be managed
by Mr Ed Merner, the Tokyo-based Japan specialist who already manages
Schroders' range of Japanese unit trusts.
Shares are to be issued at 100p, with one warrant attached to every five
shares. Issue expenses have been capped at 4.5 per cent.

FT  08 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Gander seeks Pounds 5m in placing
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Gander Holdings, a residential property development and investment company,
is raising Pounds 5m before expenses, via an issue on a 1-for-4 basis of
71.6m shares at 7p each by way of a placing and open offer.
The company specialises in refurbishing properties in Kensington and Chelsea
in London and proceeds of the issue will be used to continue its property
acquisition programme.
Since the present management took over in January, Gander has raised Pounds
2.7m through a 1-for-2 rights issue and has bought a further six properties
for Pounds 2.61m.
Mr Oliver Vaughan, chief executive, said the residential market in west
London was at a turning point. 'There is a window of opportunity to make
acquisitions now,' he said.
The board believed that the availability of opportunities might have
diminished by 1995 as the market continued to improve.
The company's shares trade under Rule 535(2), but it intends to seek a
listing in due course. The placing and offer is fully underwritten by
Charles Stanley &amp; Company.

FT  08 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Allied Colloids ahead after better second
half
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A 'markedly better' second half enabled Allied Colloids, the speciality
chemicals group, to increase full year profits by 3.5 per cent from Pounds
44.4m to Pounds 45.9m, in spite of a 15 per cent drop in interim profits.
The group forecast a 'better growth in profits' in the current year.
Group margins, which had been depressed in the first half, bounced back.
After suffering from adverse exchange rates in the first half, currencies
contributed about Pounds 3m to Pounds 4m in the second, and a further Pounds
1m profit came from the group's captive insurance subsidiary, set up after
the fire at one group plant in 1992, as no claims were made.
Margins also improved through tighter cost control, higher prices and more
stable raw material prices and greater efficiencies, Mr Gordon Senior,
finance director, said.
Group sales in the year to April 2 were up 10.8 per cent to Pounds 326.8m.
Its customers are in a wide range of industries around the world, with many
seeing signs of a recovery.
Only in the UK, which accounts for 13 per cent of total sales, were sales
not ahead, with the sharpest growth reported from Asia, and 'substantial
increases' in continental Europe and North America.
The company said all the main product divisions recorded increased sales,
with pollution control overtaking paper products as the largest.
Operating profits were 5.4 per cent higher at Pounds 46.7m (Pounds 44.3m)
giving a margin of 14.3 per cent for the year, down from the 1993 figure of
15 per cent, but well up from the first half's 12.1 per cent.
There was a Pounds 258,000 loss from the new joint venture with Courtaulds,
representing start-up costs, and the net interest charge was Pounds 499,000
(credit Pounds 124,000). Net debt at the year end was less than Pounds 1m,
but the charge reflected lower rates on the cash balances of Pounds 24.1m
while the borrowings are at fixed rates.
A tax rate of 28.8 per cent (33.2 per cent) reflected higher capital
expenditure of Pounds 26.7m compared to a depreciation charge of Pounds 14m,
and a tax refund in Germany. The rate is expected to rise to about 30 per
cent in the current year.
That left earnings per share up 9.6 per cent to 12.45p, and a proposed final
dividend of 3.72p (3.35p) gives a total payment of 4.72p (4.29p) - up 10 per
cent.
A one-for-one scrip is planned.
COMMENT
Allied Colloids has long been a favoured stock and was quickly forgiven its
interim profit blip. After these figures, forecasts for the current year
were being increased with top estimates now up to Pounds 57m pre-tax, and
the shares rose 11p to 260p. Those numbers depend on another good sales
increase and a full year of margins at the level of the second half, which
may be a bit much to hope for. However, the high continuing level of capital
spending, expected at Pounds 35m this year, should keep profits moving ahead
in coming years. On more conservative estimates of Pounds 54m, the
prospective p/e is 18.4. That looks on the high side, but may not stop the
shares outperforming in the longer term.

FT  08 JUN 94 / UK Company News: TR Property net asset value surges by 46%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOAN GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Strong performances by the smaller property companies, investments in which
comprise 60 per cent of its assets helped TR Property Investment Trust
achieve a 46 per cent increase in net asset value per share to 41.97p at the
March 31 year end.
This compares with a 29 per cent rise in the FT-SE-A Property Index.
The company saw a 25.9 per cent increase in total revenue from Pounds 8.48m
to Pounds 10.7m, including a Pounds 1.3m one-off profit on the disposal of a
portfolio of development properties in an associated undertaking.
Profit before tax increased by 38.5 per cent from Pounds 3.9m to Pounds
5.4m, and a low tax charge of Pounds 1.34m (Pounds 1.19m) helped earnings
per share rise 50 per cent to 1.43p (0.95p).
To help rebuild reserves and improve dividend cover an unchanged final of
0.5p is recommended, making a same-again total of 0.9p.
There had been a 'strong market in property shares, particularly in the
junior companies in which we specialise, as against lower returns from
direct property,' said Mr Peter Duffy, director.
Consequently, while 29 per cent of the trust's gross assets of Pounds 109m
were held as direct property at the beginning of the year and the balance in
securities, by the year end the direct property component had been reduced
to 22.7 per cent of the Pounds 156m total.
In April TR bought a Pounds 39m property portfolio from PosTel, and the
percentage of assets held as direct property has risen to 31 per cent.
It also raised Pounds 41m cash through a placing and offer, of which Pounds
25m has now been invested, said Mr Duffy, '90 per cent of it in
middle-ranking UK property companies which offer the best medium term growth
prospects'.

FT  08 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Coal boost fuels Leigh rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Improved profits from coal extraction and lower interest charges helped
Leigh Interests, the waste management group, increase pre-tax profits by 4
per cent to Pounds 9.9m last year on a similar rise in sales to Pounds
113.2m.
The profit rise is the first since 1991, when recession began to hit the
operations in the south of England.
It was fuelled by a Pounds 1m rise in operating profits to Pounds 2.3m in
the coal extraction business - the result of the need to dig holes for
landfill. Profits were also helped by an 18 per cent fall to Pounds 3.4m in
interest charges.
The final dividend is held for the third year at 5.37p, for an unchanged
total of 7.83p. Earnings were 5 per cent ahead at 10.8p.
Mr Arthur Kent, finance director, said cover would have to be rebuilt before
the dividend could be increased. This meant profits would have to recover to
1991's peak of Pounds 14.8m.
The cautious policy arises in a year which saw competition and over-capacity
in the liquid waste sector hit the group.
Volumes fell by 5 per cent while average prices for treated waste dropped 3
per cent. This trend continued and was also beginning to hit incinerated
waste.
Mr Kent said Leigh was tackling the problem by extending its waste treatment
processes and cutting costs. About Pounds 1m had been cut from on-going
costs, he said. Exceptional charges of Pounds 700,000 were taken for
redundancies and reorganisation.
Offsetting the bad news on liquid waste, Mr Kent said Leigh was confident
the marginal improvement in landfill prices would continue.
Leigh said its financial position was secure, as it had agreed a Pounds 45m
revolving credit facility with a banking consortium. Net debt fell from
Pounds 50m to Pounds 48m, representing 69 per cent of shareholders' funds.
COMMENT
Leigh was one of the first in its sector to feel the bite of recession, but
shows no signs of being an early recovery play. The coal businesses is doing
better, largely because Leigh is extracting from its own sites rather than
British Coal's, but there are no plans for pushing this forward. The waste
business now appears to hang on the long-promised draft EU directive
forbidding the disposal of liquid waste with solid. When that becomes fact
is anyone's guess. Forecasts are for Pounds 11.5m, for a prospective p/e of
17. This might appear somewhat over-valued, at least until another bid
rumour comes along.

FT  08 JUN 94 / UK Company News: A consortium with some political clout -
Breakaway union casts its eyes on the British Coal assets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Arthur Scargill must have viewed events at the Union of Democratic
Mineworkers in the last year or so with some pleasure.
The president of the National Union of Mineworkers feels the same sort of
contempt for the UDM, a breakaway from his union, as he does for the
forthcoming privatisation of the coal industry.
So the UDM's early difficulties over the privatisation process will have
provided him with a few wry smiles.
Last year it announced it would be bidding for British Coal assets with
companies including East Midlands Electricity and Jim Walter Resources, of
the US, only to find its prospective partners drop out later.
It must be hoping its latest liaison - with Coal Investments, the mining
company led by Mr Malcolm Edwards, a former British Coal director - is more
soundly based.
Mr Edwards and the UDM announced last month they had formed a consortium to
consider bidding for British Coal assets which are being sold later this
year.
They have applied to NM Rothschild, the merchant bank advising the
government on privatisation, to 'pre-qualify' to bid in three English
regions and are thought to have been successful.
Coal Investments is looking at the possibilities in south Wales alone and in
Scotland with another consortium.
For the UDM, the attractions of Coal Investments are obvious enough.
Mr Edwards has his critics, among them Mr Neil Clarke, chairman of British
Coal who sacked him as marketing director two years ago after a series of
clashes. And although former colleagues at British Coal admire and like Mr
Edwards for his intellect and humour, some agree with Mr Clarke's assessment
that he was too outspoken and individualistic.
'He had his own agenda and sometimes he did not confide in us what it was,'
complained one. 'He was not a team player.'
Others say that as British Coal's commercial director in 1990 he should have
negotiated a five year rather than three year deal with the generators but
at lower prices.
This would have secured a larger market for the industry, even if only
temporarily. Mr Edwards says he would have been in favour of such a deal but
that in practical terms it was never on offer.
Whatever the merits of the 1990 deal, few dispute Mr Edwards' enthusiasm for
coal and his ability to motivate employees he rates and the investors whose
funds are needed to develop the ind-ustry.
Since Mr Edwards reversed Coal Investments into Geevor, Britain's oldest
quoted mining company, last October, shares in the enlarged company have
risen more than sevenfold.
That makes Coal Investments the stock market's best performer in the period;
no mean achievement for a company whose main selling point is its plans to
reopen up to five pits rejected as unprofitable by British Coal. Only one is
so far in full production.
In spite of doubts among other coal companies about potential markets, Mr
Edwards says there is no problem selling coal. 'I wish I had more,' he says.
'The market is screaming for it.'
However, he is cautious about the possibilities of bidding for the five
regional packages which include British Coal's opencast sites and 16
operating collieries.
Mr Edwards believes the five regions may be a riskier investment than the
pits he is already operating under leasing and licensing arrangements
because of problems over liabilities.
'We need to see what is on offer and if they can be made to work,' he says,
adding that bids are by no means certain.
The UDM, led by Mr Neal Greatrex, may be more enthusiastic. Although it has
kept proportionally far more of its members than the NUM since 1985, it now
has less than 4,000 still working, against a peak of more than 26,000. It is
seeking a more substantial role.
However, the union has yet to show that it can transform itself from a
traditional union to a more business-oriented organisation.
Mr Greatrex says that in the new consortium, management decisions would be
left to Mr Edwards but adds he would expect UDM directors to have a right of
veto on working practice changes. That will raise an eyebrow or two among
potential investors.
The UDM does, however, possess an asset in the goodwill of the government.
Tory MPs are still conscious of the UDM members' role in helping to defeat
the NUM strike of 1984-85. Some, though probably a declining number, believe
the party still has a debt to discharge to the UDM.
That perceived debt would give a UDM/Coal Investments consortium some
political clout if it entered the bidding fray. In addition the union can
tap into funds promised by the government to help employee buy-outs.
Although the Coal Investments/UDM consortium has the option of tendering for
the three English regions of British Coal, the chances of it bidding
successfully for all of them are remote.
Developing them would involve an outlay of several hundred millions of
pounds, including the tender prices.
Mr Edwards may have worked wonders on the stock market but his company is
still valued at less than Pounds 35m. And with most of its mines yet to
produce coal in significant quantities, the company is still largely
untested.
In addition, any consortium involving the UDM would have to think long and
hard about launching a bid for the central north region where Mr Scargill's
NUM is predominant.
The consortium is considered a much more likely bidder for central south,
where virtually all miners are members of the UDM.

Ross Group, the consumer electronics and technical services group, is making
two sales worth a total of about Pounds 5.5m. The moves mark a further
focusing on core activities.
Volex Accessories, a Hanson subsidiary, has acquired Traveller
International, the travel accessories company, for about Pounds 4.15m,

FT  08 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Nationwide up 47% but mortgage demand flat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nationwide Building Society, the UK's third largest, yesterday announced a
47 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 252.7m for the year ended
April 4 despite flat mortgage demand.
The society benefited particularly from a reduction in loan loss provisions,
cuts in administrative expenses and strong commission growth from sales of
life and general insurance products.
Net mortgage balances for the year were stable at Pounds 28.1bn, and
Nationwide said it had taken steps to improve the quality of its mortgage
business. Provisions for losses on mortgage loans fell to Pounds 256.2m
(Pounds 285m), while other loan provisions fell from Pounds 44.3m to Pounds
26.1m.
Mr John Wriglesworth, building society analyst at stockbrokers UBS Philips
and Drew, said that while the latest results showed a strong improvement at
Nationwide, 'they are not out of the river yet'.
The society's ratio of provisions to loans, at 1 per cent, is still well
above the industry average of 0.7 per cent.
While Nationwide has made great strides in paring its costs-to-income ratio
to 49.44 per cent against 53.45 per cent a year ago, the ratio remains well
above the average of 43 per cent for the top 20 building societies.
Retail deposits remained unchanged at Pounds 25.4bn despite tough
competition for individual customers' funds, Nationwide said. Wholesale
funds also were little changed at Pounds 7.02bn, compared with Pounds
7.33bn.
The society's gross capital ratio rose to 7.5 per cent from 6.6 per cent at
the end of the previous fiscal year, while its free capital ratio rose from
4.9 per cent to 6 per cent.
Mr Tim Melville-Ross, chief executive, said that in an effort to develop
stronger relationships with its retail customers, it planned a further
targeted individual mailing to all its discontinued account customers.
In retail financial services, Nationwide earned Pounds 115m from commissions
on the sale of life and general insurance products, up from Pounds 107.7m.
Nationwide, which currently has an exclusive agreement to sell the products
of Guardian Insurance, plans its own insurance subsidiary, Nationwide Life,
from 1995.

FT  08 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Anglian Group at Pounds 25min improving
market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Anglian Group, the double glazing company, yesterday announced an 8.7 per
cent increase in annual pre-tax profits to Pounds 25.1m, despite the loss of
business from the privatisation of the Property Services Agency.
Mr Bill Hancock, chief executive, said: 'We do not expect the current year
to be easy, but consumer confidence in the domestic sector, though still
patchy, has improved.'
The share price rose 13p to 251p yesterday, but that compared with a price
of more than 320p before the March profits warnings over PSA sales.
Anglian revealed that sales to the PSA market for the year to April 2 had
fallen from Pounds 19.2m to Pounds 7.8m. It added, however, that it had
achieved a reasonable level of lower margin sales to the PSA's successors
and had also increased sales to local authorities and housing authorities.
Reflecting this confidence, the dividend for the year is being increased by
8.4 per cent to 10.3p via a recommended final of 6.2p. Earnings per share
rose from 18.7p to 19.3p.
Total turnover increased by 17 per cent to Pounds 176.7m, although Pounds
17.2m of the figure was attributable to recently-acquired New England
Windows. Increased retail sales made up for the PSA shortfall. Overall,
profit margins were roughly maintained at 14.8 per cent.
Anglian said the new automated production line would begin operating later
this month and said it was confident this would enable it to ease pressure
on its profit margins. These would also be boosted by a 5 per cent increase
in prices, put through in January.
The company recently acquired a 77.5 per cent stake in Living Design, one of
Scotland's largest window and kitchen groups. It was now looking at the
possibility of acquiring a PVC-u business to lower costs for the new
production base.
Anglian has also expanded into the security alarm business through the
purchase of 75 per cent of Status Innovations, with a view to marketing
security products to its existing client base.
COMMENT
Anglian has succeeded in weathering the recession with remarkable ease, but
having already taken a main share of the market it is going to struggle to
achieve more. Its new production line should help maintain profit margins,
but the market place remains competitive, and it will have to rely on volume
increases to boost its profits. Analysts believe it can push pre-tax profits
up to Pounds 28m for the current year, which leaves the shares on a p/e
ratio of 11.6. This suggests some upside potential for the share price, but
the outlook is unexciting.

via placing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bloomsbury Publishing, the Soho-based company started in 1986 is seeking to
raise Pounds 5m in a placing when it comes to the market this month, writes
Antonia Sharpe.
The flotation will value the company at about Pounds 8.5m. A prospectus will
be issued next week and dealings should start the week after.
Of the total raised, Pounds 2m will go to Bloomsbury's original backers
which include Baring Venture Partners, Caledonia Investments and ECI
Ventures.
After the flotation, their combined stake will fall from a little less than
50 per cent to a little more than 10 per cent. About Pounds 250,000 will be
shared among the authors who are beneficiaries of the Bloomsbury Authors'
Trust.
The remainder will be used to expand into home reference books, paperbacks
and children's books.

FT  08 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Henderson Admin rises 39% to Pounds 20.3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Henderson Administration, the fund management group, increased funds under
management by 18 per cent to Pounds 13.5bn at the end of March 1994, in
spite of losing pension fund accounts.
Pre-tax profits were up 39 per cent from Pounds 14.6m to Pounds 20.3m. These
are the first full-year results to include a full contribution from the
Touche Remnant fund management business, acquired in December 1992.
Revenue increased by 38 per cent from Pounds 47.7m to Pounds 65.7m, and
expenses rose 26 per cent to Pounds 48.1m, producing an operating profit of
Pounds 17.6m. Interest and investment income fell from Pounds 5.48m to
Pounds 2.18m.
Earnings per share grew 43 per cent to 65.3p, and the total dividend rose 5
per cent to 44p after a recommended final of 31.5p (29.5p).
Mr Ben Wrey, chairman, blamed the loss of pension fund business on the
highly competitive state of the pensions market, where the tendency was for
funds to be concentrated in the hands of the top four or five managers.
Mr Wrey said Henderson was relying on its improved performance record,
placing it twelfth out of 36 managers over a five year period, to stop the
outflow of funds. The group had Pounds 5.25bn (Pounds 5.38bn) pension money
under management at the end of March.
Funds under management increased most sharply in the international division,
being more than doubled at Pounds 984m, against Pounds 467m. The figure
included Seligman Henderson, the US joint venture, as well as other clients
in the US and the Netherlands. Funds under administration, including
offshore funds and Peps, grew by 85 per cent to Pounds 1.4bn.
On the retail side, one new investment trust, the HTR Japanese Smaller
Companies trust, was launched during the year. The unit trust range was
rationalised to remove overlaps between Henderson and Touche Remnant funds.
Investment trust funds under management stood at Pounds 3.58bn at the year
end, up 24 per cent, and unit trusts at Pounds 1.34bn, up 18 per cent.
Associated businesses made a profit of Pounds 464,000, after a loss of
Pounds 585,000 last year.

FT  08 JUN 94 / UK Company News: RPC advances 12%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RPC Group, the rigid plastic packaging maker which came to the stock market
in May last year, yesterday reported an 11.8 per cent rise in pre-tax
profits from Pounds 6.83m to Pounds 7.63m in the 53 weeks to March 31.
Mr Lindsay Mackinlay, chairman, said the results were in line with the
group's expectations at the time of the float, and that the current year had
'started satisfactorily although our markets remain competitive'. The
shares, which were floated at 125p, fell 1p to 151p yesterday.
Operating margins increased once more, from 10.8 per cent to 11.5 per cent,
and Mr Ron Marsh, chief executive, said there was scope to improve them yet
further.
Mr Chris Sworn, finance director, said the margin increase stemmed from
higher volumes, a reduction in some overheads, including audit fees, and a
switch from low margin products such as soft drink bottles to higher margin
lines like sauce bottles.
Mr Marsh said new products included bottles for Marks and Spencer's bath
foams, bottles for Tate &amp; Lyle 'Tops' syrups, and squeezy bottles for HP
Sauce. A range of baby wipe containers employed three different processors
and RPC was the only UK producer who could supply the full range. It had
also recently introduced 25 per cent post-consumer recycled material into
its plastic paint containers, meeting environmental concerns.
Group sales rose 6.7 per cent to Pounds 68m, roughly equalling the increase
in tonnes of raw materials used as prices remained under pressure.
Operating profits rose 13 per cent to Pounds 7.85m, before a rise in the
interest charge to Pounds 220,000 (Pounds 123,000), which was caused by the
Pounds 4.18m cash outflow at the time of the float when preference shares
were redeemed and some ordinary shares bought in.
Year end debt stood at Pounds 4.09m, 15 per cent of shareholders funds.
The tax rate was 28 per cent, and earnings per share were 9.4p. A
recommended final dividend of 2.2p gives a total of 3.2p, compared to a
notional 3p.

FT  08 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Laura Ashley's Pounds 1.2m for Maxmin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jim Maxmin, the former chief executive of Laura Ashley, is to receive a
Pounds 1.2m pay-off following his abrupt departure from the fashion retailer
which he is widely credited with reviving.
The news of Mr Maxmin's compensation package, which includes two years'
salary and pension payments, was accompanied by the departure from the board
of his protege, Ms Denise Lincoln, the human resources director.
Further management changes are likely to be announced within the next few
weeks, although it is not clear whether Mr Maxmin will be replaced. Mr Hugh
Blakeway-Webb, who lives in the US and receives expenses of Pounds 1,000 a
day, stepped up from non-executive to executive chairman following his
departure.
Mr Maxmin left Laura Ashley in April after what was described as a
disagreement over investment priorities. It is understood that Mr Maxmin was
pushing for greater investment in human resources, while the non-executives
wanted to focus on retailing.
The non-executives include Mr Takuya Okada of Aeon, the Japanese group which
bailed out Laura Ashley with a Pounds 30m cash injection in 1990.
Mr Maxmin was on a two-year rolling contract, with a salary of Pounds
399,000 (Dollars 590,000).

FT  08 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Boost for National Grid flotation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
National Grid, operator of the high voltage power transmission system in
England and Wales, yesterday fuelled expectations of a flotation next year
when it increased dividends by 15.3 per cent against expectations of 10 per
cent.
The company, which is owned by the regional electricity companies, announced
pre-tax profits for the year to March 31 in line with forecast at Pounds
579.5m, against Pounds 533.2m.
However a lower than expected tax charge enabled the company to pay a final
dividend of Pounds 2,062 making a total for the year of Pounds 2,982. It
said the dividend rise was in line with the improvement in after tax
earnings.
The profits growth was aided by a 9.5 per cent drop in staff numbers which
stood at 4,682 at the year end, excluding those employed by the Energis
telecommunications subsidiary. That compares with 6,537 in March 1991.
Energis accounted for Pounds 90m of the company's capital expenditure of
Pounds 351m (Pounds 389m). The main transmission business accounted for
Pounds 243m.
Some 1,500km of fibre optic cable has already been installed for Energis
which is due to start services later this year.
Total group turnover increased marginally from Pounds 1.39bn to Pounds
1.43bn, reflecting income from increased new connections and higher sales in
the ancillary services business.
At the end of the year under-recovery of revenues against the regulated
maximum amount was about Pounds 14m. The company is allowed to recover the
shortfall through adjustments to charges in future years.
Net debt decreased by Pounds 116.4m to Pounds 323m, leading to a fall in the
net debt to equity ratio from 31 per cent to 19 per cent.
The company's performance will reinforce the City's belief that the
regulatory regime on prices, in place until 1997, is relatively benign.
Nonetheless it provides a strong platform for the recs to stage a flotation.
A disposal of at least 25 per cent of the company is likely next year,
possibly in the spring.
Analysts believe the company is worth between Pounds 4bn and Pounds 5bn.

FT  08 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Measurement setback for Staveley
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROLINE SOUTHEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Staveley Industries, the measurement and mechanical engineering company
which also owns British Salt, suffered a 65 per cent fall in pre-tax profits
in the year to April 2 after a poor performance and a Pounds 10m
reorganisation charge in its measurement division.
However, the total dividend will be held at 8.5p via an unchanged final of
6.2p.
Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 24.4m to Pounds 8.6m on turnover down 2 per
cent at Pounds 338.9m (Pounds 344.9m). Operating profits dipped 19 per cent
to Pounds 20.2m.
'We have had a difficult year, but we believe the major problems have been
tackled. I feel we have good prospects for growth - the key is to bring in
the benefits of the reorganisation,' said Mr Roy Hitchens, chief executive.
The company's minerals division, which supplies more than half of the UK
salt market, lifted operating profits from Pounds 12.2m to Pounds 13m.
However, the measurement division performed poorly with operating profits
down to Pounds 5.1m (Pounds 8.4m). The reorganisation includes rationalising
Chronos Richardson, the systems division, by creating a single global
operation.
Its plants in Germany and the US will be closed and manufacture transferred
to Nottingham where the company will use a network of subcontractors. Mr
Hitchens said this was to exploit UK labour rates which were 50 per cent
lower than Germany's.
The mechanical and electrical services side suffered a 9 per cent drop in
profits to Pounds 4m.
Earnings per share fell 79 per cent to 3.4p, but excluding re-organisation
and exceptional costs they dropped 14 per cent to 13.9p (16.1p).
COMMENT
Staveley's latest reorganisation plan faces a credibility problem. Several
earlier attempts to overhaul the measurement division have failed over the
past six years. But the new management team deserves the benefit of the
doubt. If the division's shake up works, growth could be enhanced by
acquisitions in niche markets. The minerals division remains safe and
cash-generative. The mechanical and electrical services division should
perform better next year as the upturn in construction takes hold. Pre-tax
profits of Pounds 25m look possible this year for earnings of 16.4p. On a
closing price yesterday of 209p, down  1/2 p, the shares are on prospective
p/e of 12.7. That is good value if the management makes good on their
promises.

FT  08 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Powerscreen declines to Pounds 24.6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Powerscreen International, the Northern Ireland-based manufacturer of
screening and stone crushing equipment, yesterday announced a marginal
decline in annual pre-tax profits due to the impact of disposals in early
1993.
The company recorded a strong improvement in sales from the UK market and
east Asia, primarily Japan resulting in group turnover of Pounds 122.5m
(Pounds 108.3m). Mr Shay McKeown, chief executive, said order books for the
first two months of the year were 'very healthy'.
Pre-tax profits for the year to end-March slipped from Pounds 25.3m to
Pounds 24.6m due to the loss of contributions from Guzzler, the US
subsidiary.
However, Powerscreen's three core businesses all showed growth, and
operating profits from continuing operations grew by 11 per cent to Pounds
23.9m.
The company is also increasing its dividend by 11 per cent to 7.3p, with a
proposed final of 5.3p. Earnings per share rose to 22.4p (20.7p) due to a
smaller tax charge resulting from lower US earnings. The share price closed
6p higher at 255p.
The UK and Ireland now account for 35 per cent of sales, with North America
accounting for 26 per cent and Europe for 30 per cent. Screening,
responsible for about half of turnover, experienced a 22 per cent increase
in sales, aided by an upswing in the UK construction market and increased
infrastructure spending in the US and east Asia.
Simplicity Engineering and Ludlow-Saylor, two US businesses acquired in
February, made a Pounds 2m contribution to sales and are already operating
profitably. The crushing and recycling products division recorded a 10 per
cent sales increase, with its performance hampered by a decline in its
recession-hit European markets.
Brown Lenox doubled machine sales to the UK and Ireland and the materials
handling division, primarily its Matbro subsidiary, saw a 62 per cent
increase in sales, having substantially broadened its product range and
built up an export dealer network.
COMMENT
After eight consecutive years of profits growth Powerscreen has finally
recorded a decline, but this merely reflected business disposals. Overall,
the results were positive, with profit margins maintained. Profits should
hit Pounds 28m this year, putting the shares on a p/e of 10.4, and it should
remain on a strong growth track for the following year. Powerscreen has
switched to one of the big four accountancy firms and has increased
disclosure, which should win over some City sceptics. After their recent
decline, the shares appear to offer value.

FT  08 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Amersham shows 65% growth to Pounds 43.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Solid underlying business growth, exchange rate movements and a US
acquisition helped Amersham International, the health science group,
increase pre-tax profit by 65 per cent from Pounds 26.3m to Pounds 43.5m in
the year to March 31.
Turnover increased by 20 per cent to Pounds 324.2m (Pounds 269.3m). This
reflected a Pounds 30.7m first time contribution from US Biochemical
acquired last April, offset by a Pounds 23.8m reduction in turnover from the
Clinical Reagents business transferred to Eastman Kodak.
Earnings per share, reflecting the 4.9m shares issued to acquire USB, grew
by 55 per cent to 47p, up from 30.4p the previous year. A recommended final
dividend of 11.1p (9.5p) makes a total for the year of 15.5p, up 15 per
cent. The shares closed 33p higher at 971p.
Trading profits increased by 54 per cent to Pounds 63.4m (Pounds 41.1m),
with USB accounting for Pounds 4.9m of the increase. Underlying turnover and
trading profits both increased by 10 per cent.
After a 26 per cent increase in research and development spending of Pounds
20.1m (Pounds 15.9m), operating profits were 72 per cent higher at Pounds
43.3m (Pounds 25.2m), including a Pounds 3.1m contribution from USB and a
net Pounds 13.2m year-on-year gain from exchange rate movements. Underlying
operating profit growth at constant exchange rates was 7 per cent.
Life sciences, the largest division, which sells reagents to medical and
pharmaceutical research establishments and now includes USB, returned to
real profit growth.
It generated operating profits of Pounds 31.2m (Pounds 19.1m) on turnover 49
per cent higher at Pounds 147.6m.
The healthcare division boosted turnover by 26 per cent to Pounds 119.3m and
more than doubled operating profits to Pounds 9.4m (Pounds 3.9m.)
The group's share of associated undertakings increased to Pounds 600,000
(Pounds 200,000).
Net interest costs of Pounds 400,000 compared with net receipts of Pounds
900,000. Despite spending Pounds 10.6m in cash on the USB acquisition the
group ended March with net cash of Pounds 7.7m compared with Pounds 2.6m a
year earlier.
COMMENT
Amersham's performance, and its management which has rejuvenated the
business, continues to impress. The underlying profit growth remains solid
and last year's exchange rate gains helped fund the substantial increase in
R&amp;D spend and new branded product launches which will fuel its future.
performance. Much more modest currency gains are expected this year but
pre-tax profits of Pounds 51m look possible, producing earnings of about 55p
a share. The stock is trading on a forward multiple of 17.6, but could still
go higher. In the meantime dividend cover has been restored to three times,
and future dividend growth should be more in line with earnings.

The non-executives were also thought to have been unhappy with Laura
Ashley's performance in the US, where Mr Maxmin frankly admits the company
failed to get to grips with the problems. However, it is widely acknowledged
that the US side is back on track.
Mr Maxmin was on a two-year rolling contract, with a salary of Pounds
399,000 or Dollars 590,000 in the last annual report. He also has options on
2m shares at 70p and 90p which he will retain.
Two days after announcing Mr Maxmin's departure, the group reported pre-tax
profits of Pounds 3m on sales of Pounds 300m.
Ms Lincoln is expected to receive a compensation package of about Pounds
200,000. She was appointed to the board in 1992.

FT  08 JUN 94 / US insurer to revive A&amp;A with Dollars 200m injection
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Alexander &amp; Alexander, the US insurance broker, is to get a Dollars 200m
capital injection from the country's biggest property/casualty insurer,
American International Group, as part of a plan to revive its ailing
finances.
The deal will leave AIG with preferred stock convertible into 21 per cent of
A&amp;A's shares. The broker also slashed its dividend from 25 cents to just 2.5
cents to help preserve its depleted capital.
A&amp;A also announced late yesterday that Mr Frank Zarb, formerly a
vice-chairman at financial services group Travelers, had been appointed
chairman, chief executive and president. Mr Zarb ran Travelers' securities
broker, Smith Barney, for five years, turning it around from losses into one
of the most profitable retail brokers in the US. Since then he has run its
Primerica Financial Services arm and asset management companies.
A&amp;A has suffered from legal settlements, depressed conditions in the
property/casualty insurance market and a failure to cut costs. Its former
chairman and chief executive, Mr Tinsley Irvin, was removed in January.
Both AIG and A&amp;A denied that the deal would undermine the broker's
independence. Under an eight-year standstill agreement, AIG cannot take a
voting stake of more than 9.9 per cent in the company. Prudential, the US
insurer, already owns 9.9 per cent of the common stock.
A&amp;A, which in the 1980s bought the Canadian firm Reed Stenhouse, as well as
Sphere Drake and Alexander Howden in the UK, is the second biggest broker in
the world after Marsh &amp; McLennan. It suffered fraud-related losses at
Alexander Howden, and in 1992 announced a Dollars 145m after-tax charge to
cover asbestos and environmental liabilities taken on with Sphere Drake.
Part of the Dollars 200m from AIG will be used to buy reinsurance to cover
the Sphere Drake losses, the broker said. Its assessment of the scale of
these losses has not changed since 1992.
AIG will receive an 8 per cent dividend on its convertible preference stock,
payable in the form of additional securities. The stock is convertible into
common shares at Dollars 17 a share - a rate fixed during discussions
between the two companies on May 13, when the share price slumped towards
Dollars 14. Yesterday the shares rose Dollars 1 3/8 to close at Dollars 17
3/4.

FT  08 JUN 94 / Anglian Water to shed 900 jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Anglian Water yesterday announced 900 job cuts in the latest indication of
the upheaval facing the water sector as it faces a tougher pricing regime
from next year.
The UK utility, based in the Huntingdon constituency of prime minister Mr
John Major, is cutting 17 per cent of the 5,200 jobs in its core water and
sewerage business. Anglian is believed to be one of the top five employers
in the region.
Mr Chris Mellor, Anglian's finance director, said virtually all the job cuts
would come from administration, with little scope left for trimming the blue
collar side after substantial cuts in the mid-1980s. At least two or more
layers of management would be stripped out, he said.
Anglian is taking a Pounds 60m provision this year to pay for the
redundancies and reorganisation. Mr Mellor said Anglian expected to make
cost savings of more than Pounds 20m a year after 1996/97, with some savings
beginning this year. About 500-600 of the proposed job cuts would take
effect from October, with the balance over the next two years.
The announcement comes as water companies examine the draft price increases
set by Ofwat, the industry regulator, in May. Mr Ian Byatt, director general
of Ofwat, is thought to feel the water companies have not cut costs quickly
enough since privatisation in 1989. He is expected to set tough efficiency
targets as part of the current price review, which will be made public on
July 28.
The Pounds 60m charge left pre-tax profits 40 per cent down at Pounds 132.2m
for the year to March 31. Stripping out the provision, profits were 4 per
cent ahead at Pounds 192.2m. Sales were 18 per cent up at Pounds 687.9m.
The core utility reported a 20 per cent fall in operating profits to Pounds
171.8m on sales 6 per cent ahead at Pounds 594.5m. Acquisitions helped the
unregulated division increase sales from Pounds 29.1m to Pounds 102.4m. The
Pounds 4.3m costs of closing non-core businesses left the unregulated
operation with losses of Pounds 3.5m against Pounds 5m last time.
The dividend was increased to 15.5p, for a total 8 per cent higher at 22.8p.
Earnings per share fell by 31 per cent to 39p. Excluding the charge,
earnings were 5 per cent ahead at 59.2p.

FT  08 JUN 94 / Wellcome opts for single global auditor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK and DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The board of Wellcome, the pharmaceuticals group, has approved a plan to
remove accountants Touche Ross and appoint Coopers &amp; Lybrand as sole global
auditor and lead tax consultant from the start of next year.
Details of the plan emerged after the company announced on Friday the
surprise departure of Mr John Precious, the finance director, who it said
was leaving 'to pursue other opportunities'. This was the latest in a series
of boardroom and management changes, presided over by Mr John Robb, chairman
and chief executive.
However, Mr Justin Court, group financial controller, stressed yesterday: 'I
really want to be utterly categorical that there is no connection with the
departure of Mr Precious.'
He said the controller's department had begun considering a change to a
single firm a year ago in an effort to save costs. 'It has been in the
pipeline for a long time. This will provide fee synergies. Our level of
indulgence has gone down somewhat. We are quite keen to get a bit more
briskness.'
He said Coopers won the audit following a 'beauty parade' in March which
included the three other firms that audit Wellcome subsidiaries around the
world: Touche Ross, Price Waterhouse and KPMG Peat Marwick.
Mr Court expected the company's total audit fee - which was Pounds 800,000
last year - to fall by between 30 and 40 per cent.
But he said that Coopers, the UK's largest firm, had won the contract
primarily because of its strength in the pharmaceuticals sector. He said
price was 'an issue but not the issue'.
Some Wellcome executives are believed to have expressed anxieties about
Touche following last year's reprimand of Trafalgar House, one of its audit
clients, by the Financial Reporting Review Panel, the UK accounts watchdog.
But Mr Court said this was not a factor in the selection.
Wellcome's decision is the latest in a trend among international companies
to appoint a single global firm of accountants as auditors, which often
saves considerable costs.
For example, Touche Ross itself has recently gained the worldwide audits of
Reed-Elsevier and Credit Lyonnais. Coopers is global auditor to companies
including Glaxo.
Mr Clive Thompson, chief executive of Rentokil and a non-executive director
of Wellcome, said: 'The company has used a number of auditors around the
world. It has changed shape and it was time to appraise the benefit of
having a single auditor. All company audit committees should do this.'

FT  08 JUN 94 / Vodafone throws down gauntlet: Group dares rivals on cuts -
Cellnet says none needed / Analysts surprised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Vodafone, the UK mobile communications group, said it expected to make no
cuts in mobile phone tariffs this year and dared its rivals to cut theirs.
At yesterday's results meeting Mr Gerry Whent, chief executive, said: 'They
dare not cut another single penny, otherwise they will never see a profit.'
Cellnet, Vodafone's main rival in the mobile cellular market, immediately
responded that it was 'happy to see that Vodafone shares our view that no
price cuts are needed'.
The announcements took some analysts by surprise, given that some mobile
phone tariffs have fallen by more than a third in the past year, which has
seen the launch of Mercury One-2-One and Hutchison Microtel's Orange.
However, one analyst said the statements were a 'clear bid' to reassure the
new operators that they need not resort to tariff cutting to build UK market
share.
Vodafone announced a 13 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 363.3m
for the year to March 31. Turnover increased 28 per cent to Pounds 850.5m,
or 19 per cent leaving aside acquisitions.
Mr Chris Gent, managing director of Vodafone's UK activities, predicted that
the UK cellular market would grow by about 50 per cent this year, with
Vodafone broadly maintaining its 59 per cent share of the value of new
business, although its share of overall subscribers might fall. Last year it
saw 40 per cent growth to 1.17m in subscribers to its UK network.
Vodafone claimed to have 57 per cent of the lucrative UK cellular business
market, despite falling to 54 per cent of subscribers as a whole - with most
of the loss having gone to Cellnet.
Mr Whent said the company faced two challenges: transferring new UK
customers from its analogue to its new digital networks; and building up its
international holdings to equal its UK cellular business in terms of the
value of overseas markets covered. Vodafone has stakes in newly opened
networks in Sweden, Germany, Hong Kong, Greece, Australia, South Africa and
Malta. Start-up costs trebled to Pounds 45m last year and are projected to
reach Pounds 80m this year. The group had year-end net cash of Pounds
111.1m, down from Pounds 152.2m.
Vodafone is bidding for licences in Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain and
Ireland, and said it was in talks about up to four acquisitions.
Earnings per share rose 10 per cent to 24.34p (22.07p). A final dividend of
4.23p makes a total of 8.35p, up 20 per cent.
Vodafone is proposing a two-for-one scrip issue. Its shares slipped 4p to
518p yesterday.

FT  08 JUN 94 / Tricky timing in the alternative markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Commodity market fever has cooled off slightly in the past few days, but
portfolio strategists are still tempted to dabble in real assets. As for
equities, commodity-related sectors such as oils and mineral extraction are
among the few showing gains (albeit modest) in the London stock market since
the beginning of this year. Gold mining stocks, though, have been having an
indifferent time.
With commodities, of course, you have to pick your moment. In general they
have been rotten investments over the long run, with a steady fall in real
values stretching over the whole century, and particularly in the 1980s -
although there have been spectacular upsurges from the trend, such as during
the Korean War and the inflationary scares of the 1970s. There are one or
two exceptions, such as timber, which has been sustaining a fairly rapid
real rate of increase - of close to 5 per cent a year in some cases,
according to a recent World Bank study.
Nevertheless the general trend is downwards, probably reflecting consistent
declines in costs of production and transport, both for agricultural and
mineral commodities. The point, however, is that in cyclical terms the time
for commodities to shine ought to be just about now.
Last March Mr Sushil Wadwhani, of Goldman Sachs, noted that the year after
the US Federal Reserve begins to raise short-term interest rates tends to be
a strong period for commodity prices. Since the 1970s such 12-month periods
have produced average price rises of about 15 per cent, depending on the
index used, while equities and (especially) bonds have struggled.
It might seem odd that commodity prices should rise when the carrying cost
has just been increased, but of course there are much more powerful
influences involved. Inflationary fears that may have stimulated the
interest rate rise are negative for bonds but positive for commodity prices.
Stronger economic growth is likely to be affecting the supply-demand
balance. Moreover the transfer of speculative activity from the securities
markets to commodities in search of richer pickings will itself tend to push
up prices for a while.
At any rate, the pattern appears to be repeating itself. Many commodity
prices have been quite firm this year. The indices vary considerably, but
the Economist index is up 17 per cent while Goldman's own index is up a more
modest 7 per cent. Curiously the CRB Futures Index, which so terrifies the
US Treasury bond market when it strengthens, is scarcely changed on balance,
after retreating from a late May peak.
Such rises are entirely in accordance with the historical cyclical patterns,
and do not imply any general rise in the rate of inflation globally. It is
notable, for instance, that gold has played little part in the recent
revival of the commodities markets. Gold had its own speculative run a year
ago, when it reached Dollars 405 an ounce before the Soros/Goldsmith bubble
burst. This year it has been trading quietly about Dollars 15 either side of
the current Dollars 380.
Some strange things may nevertheless have been going on in the gold market,
where a tumble in the gold lease rate signifies structural changes - perhaps
heavy central bank selling absorbed by speculative buyers.
However, the real targets for commodity speculators have been the metals and
soft commodities which have been selling at below average production costs
and are best placed to benefit from cyclical recovery.
Some of the rises in 1994 so far have been quite sharp - including 23 per
cent on North Sea crude oil, 26 per cent on copper and 70 per cent on
coffee. But the markets have been dangerously flooded with speculative
money, much of it diverted from bonds after the spectacular end of last
year's bull market.
Commodity markets can therefore be seen as reflecting the flipside of bond
market sentiment: if it becomes generally accepted by the markets that the
US economy is slowing down and inflation will stay reasonably low the money
could flow straight back.
So although the cyclical case for commodities remains valid, certainly if
economic recovery kicks in later this year in continental Europe and Japan,
the ride is not likely to be at all smooth. There is no easy alternative to
the securities markets.

FT  08 JUN 94 / Leading UK actuary in talks on a US alliance: Watson move to
strengthen international service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
R Watson and Sons, Britain's leading actuarial consulting firm, is in talks
about 'an alliance' with US-based benefit consultants Wyatt and Co in a bid
to strengthen Watson's service to its increasingly multinational clientele.
A spokesman for Watson yesterday confirmed that discussions are going on but
said 'they relate to an alliance, not to a merger or a takeover'.
Senior partners are discussing what form the alliance should take and a
formal announcement is expected next week.
The move reflects the increasingly international nature of leading UK
clients which are acquiring or being acquired by overseas companies.
'Increasingly businesses are multinational and they want to manage their
employee liabilities from the core,' said one senior actuary involved in the
talks. Also, clients are seeking other benefit consultancy services, such as
the design of remuneration packages, which go beyond Watson's pension fund
consulting expertise.
An outright acquisition of Watson, valued by industry sources at Pounds 50m
to Pounds 60m, could make millionaires out of several of its 94 partners.
However, industry sources said that some of Watson's most senior partners,
while anxious to broaden the firm's international consulting capacity, want
to maintain its independence. 'Several of them have been going around saying
'Over my dead body',' said one actuary familiar with the talks.
Watson becomes the third - and the largest - of the UK actuarial consulting
firms to seek a link with a large US company in the past year. Noble Lowndes
was acquired by insurance brokers Sedgewick late last year while US-based
insurance brokers Alexander and Alexander acquired Clay and Partners in a
deal estimated at Pounds 20m.
Wyatt and Co, which is organised as a Delaware-based company whose shares
are owned by its 3,700 employees, has a leading presence in the US. It
specialises not only in pension consulting but in a broad range of employee
benefit and pay packages. It also has a leading market share in the
Australian, Hong Kong and Japanese markets. However, it has very few blue
chip UK corporate clients.
Watson, with 700 employees, has a commanding presence in the UK market where
it acts as actuarial consultant to 40 of the 100 top pension schemes.
However, despite a string of offices in Europe and Asia, it has little
genuine international capacity.

FT  08 JUN 94 / PM rules out curb on dividends in gesture to City
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The prime minister has ruled out any control of dividends in an attempt to
reassure the City that the Treasury's review of savings will not lead to new
regulation.
Mr John Major, in an interview in today's Daily Telegraph, says: 'There's no
question of dividend control from a Conservative government. Dividend
control is socialism. I'm a Tory - dividend control is a non-starter.'
The Treasury has angered pension funds and companies such as Hanson by
suggesting that UK dividend pay-outs, which have risen significantly over
the past decade, may have become too high and inflexible.
Lord Hanson, chairman of the Anglo-US conglomerate, recently accused Mr
Stephen Dorrell, Treasury financial secretary, of 'sounding like a
socialist' in questioning the wisdom of high dividends.
Mr Major, while saying that people have wrongly interpreted Mr Dorrell's
aims, appears to restrict the Treasury's room for manoeuvre by dismissing
the argument that high dividends prevent capital investment.
'Dividends are part of people's income, I don't want to cut people's income.
It is a legitimate reward from their investment.
'Neither do I personally believe there is any real problem in stopping fresh
investment. Because the dividends are paid to shareholders who reinvest,'
the prime minister says in the interview.
The Treasury has said it is looking at whether companies are paying high
dividends because of the tax system and whether companies would continue to
pay out the same level of dividend if regulations were changed.
In the interview, Mr Major refuses to be drawn on 'budgetary matters' but he
leaves scope to allow the Treasury to make changes to dividend taxation,
which is concerning the City.
However, his officials made clear that the prime minister is taking a
personal interest in the Treasury's review of savings and investment and no
proposed changes to the taxation system will go ahead if they are seen as
curtailing dividends.
Mr Major goes on to describe the Treasury's aim of greater investment as
'self-evidently attractive', since all governments want more money invested
in companies and industry.
In the wide-ranging interview, Mr Major also said:
If it was practical and prudent he would cut taxes, but added 'I cannot
forecast when that will be'
People had underestimated the importance of the Downing Street Declaration
on Northern Ireland.

FT  08 JUN 94 / French Groupe Schneider chairman released on bail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
An 11-night stay in a Brussels prison ended last night for one of France's
best known industrialists when Mr Didier Pineau-Valencienne, chairman of
Groupe Schneider, was released on bail.
Mr Pineau-Valencienne left Brussel's Forest prison at 7pm after Mr Jean
Claude Van Espen, the Belgian prosecuting judge in charge of the case, was
satisfied that there was no longer any reason to detain him.
The chairman of Schneider, one of Europe's largest electrical engineering
groups, was arrested two weeks ago on charges of fraud, embezzlement and
falsification of accounts. That followed an investigation prompted by
complaints from minority shareholders of two Belgian subsidiaries of
Schneider: Cofimines and Cofibel.
Mr Valentino Foti, an Italian businessman arrested on similar charges,
remained imprisoned in Brussels last night. According to his lawyer, he is
unlikely to be released until the Italian authorities have completed their
investigations on behalf of the Belgian prosecutors or until his appeal is
heard in Belgium.
Mr Pineau-Valencienne, who returned to Paris, was released on bail of BFr15m
(Pounds 291,000). He was also ordered by the judge to present himself
whenever required to the judicial authorities and to do nothing that might
interfere with the investigation.
The Belgian authorities came under intense political pressure to hasten Mr
Pineau-Valencienne's release after his arrest two weeks ago caused uproar in
the French media and within the business community. The arrest prompted
France's prime minister Edouard Balladur to phone his Belgian counterpart,
Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, while Mr Alain Juppe, France's foreign minister,
telephoned his opposite number, Mr Willy Claes.
Sources close to the case say the French executive met Mr Van Espen
yesterday afternoon, after further questioning by investigators recently
returned from France and Switzerland.
The accusations facing Schneider centre on its treatment of Cofibel and
Cofimines and a bid, launched in 1992, to buy out minority shareholders in
the two subsidiaries. Belgian prosecutors say there were irregularities in
the offer.
Mr Van Espen will now continue his investigation of the minority
shareholders' complaints on the basis of what the searches in France, Italy
and Switzerland have uncovered. Last week French and Belgian police searched
the Paris headquarters of Schneider.
The completed report will be presented to the Belgian prosecutors' office.
It will then be up to an advisory court to decide whether to throw out the
case or to refer it to the criminal court.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The regional electricity companies are going to find it hard not to give the
green light for a flotation of the National Grid. Yesterday's 15 per cent
rise in the Grid's dividend seems designed to maintain the pressure. It
further highlights the value of the recs' stakes in the Grid, which could be
worth Pounds 4bn as a stand-alone entity. The recs' share prices responded
accordingly, with their combined market capitalisation rising by over Pounds
100m. But the further share prices rise in anticipation of a flotation, the
more the recs are boxed in. They presumably know that a decision not to
press ahead would leave investors disappointed and hit their share prices.

well-informed investor like AIG marks the turn. The insurance brokers'
shares are trading lower than at any time since the late 1970s. AIG's
Dollars 200m investment in convertible stock should allow A&amp;A to buy
reinsurance to limit its underwriting losses. Financial flexibility should
also help attract a credible chief executive. But the performance of the
shares thereafter depends on mangement's ability to get to grips with
operational problems. Willis Coroon's last results were a reminder that

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
German bond markets were inclined to take fright at yesterday's
first-quarter growth figures. Their instinct may be right, even though the
figures must be taken with a pinch of salt. The 2.1 per cent increase in
output over the same quarter of last year falls to 1.6 per cent when account
is taken of the extra working day in the 1994 period. It was also boosted by
a weather-related increase in construction output which is unlikely to carry
forward into the second quarter. Meanwhile, the underlying trend of personal
consumption is weak. Despite the further fall in unemployment in May, the
recovery has only just begun. It is far too early to worry about
over-heating.
Yet rising output gives the Bundesbank even less excuse to ignore the
explosion in M3 money supply and cut official rates again. Nor, now that the
dollar appears to have stabilised, is there pressure emanating from the
exchange markets. Indeed the D-Mark has also recently fallen slightly
against European currencies as bond investors have sought to exploit yield
differentials with other markets.
October's election and the prospect of tax increases next year are likely to
keep consumption muted. There is a risk that high long-term interest rates
will dampen the recovery too. That risk will be greater if money is sucked
back into the US bond market once the Federal Reserve stops tightening. Then
Europe will be left wondering how to cope with its own turn in rates.

FT  08 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Anglian Water
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is staggering that nearly five years after privatisation Anglian Water
can cut one-in-five jobs from its utility business. Studies conducted by
Ofwat, the industry regulator, do not show Anglian to be especially
inefficient. Yesterday's Pounds 60m restructuring charge therefore hints at
what might be achieved elsewhere. The promised Pounds 20m annual saving
amounts to around 7 per cent of Anglian's operating costs in water and
sewerage. On that basis, it looks well placed to beat all but the most
onerous efficiency targets set by the regulator for the second half of the
decade.
Still, it is curious that Anglian should show its hand before Ofwat has
finalised its targets for 1995-2000. The company must have reasoned that
Ofwat is far enough down the road not to indulge in last minute tinkering.
To do so would rob management of the incentive to cut costs, which is
precisely what the system of price cap regulation is supposed to deliver. If
Ofwat does keep its side of the regulatory bargain, though, the outlook for
dividend growth may be better than the equity market has assumed. The
savings promised by Anglian are significant in relation to the Pounds 67m
annual cost of its dividend.
Until Ofwat announces price limits and efficiency targets on July 28, it
would be unwise to get carried away. Neither is it clear that all water
companies have the management determination to push through similarly deep
cuts. If the regulator allows a reasonable proportion of such savings to
flow through to shareholders, though, the sector may have been oversold.

Mr Gerry Whent, Vodafone's chief executive, was typically gung-ho at
yesterday's annual results. Not only did he predict that Vodafone's revenues
per subscriber would hold at last year's level of Pounds 665, despite new
rivals in the shape of Orange and Mercury One-2-One, he even forecast that
competitors would raise their prices to near the level provided by
Vodafone's 'umbrella'.
If Orange and One-2-One do indeed shelter under Vodafone's umbrella rather
than dragging it into a price war, the company's premium rating would be
more than justified. But it would be wrong to take Mr Whent's forecasts at
face value. They are best regarded as attempts to lure the new players into
a cosy oligopoly rather than predictions.
If anybody can pull off this feat, Mr Whent is probably the man. But the
dynamics of the new tetrapoly will be harder to control than that of the old
duopoly. When Orange and One-2-One attain nationwide coverage in two or so
years, their imperative will be to fill their networks up. It is hard to see
that being achieved without large price cuts.
Meanwhile, Vodafone's international strategy is set to move up a gear. It
wants to increase its stakes in overseas licences, turning them from
investments into associates and eventually subsidiaries. Greater control
would help Vodafone add value to its investments, some of which have not
performed well. The group is also likely to bid higher prices for new
licences. That makes sense given that Vodafone lost the Italian licence
through too low a bid. The more aggressive approach should enable Mr Whent
to meet his expansion targets. But it will not come cheap.

FT  08 JUN 94 / Major appeals for traditional Tory votes in Euro poll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major issued a last minute plea to traditional Conservative voters
to oppose a centralised federal Europe as the final stages of the European
elections campaign erupted yesterday into a row over job creation.
With all three party leaders winding up their campaigns at set-piece
rallies, the prime minister focused his attention on persuading traditional
Tory supporters not to abstain tomorrow in protest at the government's
domestic record.
In an implicit acknowledgement that the government needs to muster its core
support to avoid an electoral catastrophe, Mr Major said protest votes and
abstentions would severely damage Britain's interests in Europe.
He told a rally in London that the campaign had shown 'we are the only party
prepared to fight day in and day out for Britain's best interests in
Europe'.
But Labour and the Liberal Democrats insisted the poll would be a referendum
on Mr Major's record record since the 1992 general election. Mrs Margaret
Beckett, the acting Labour leader, said that voters would be rejecting a
government which was 'divided over Europe, riven with incompetence and
incapable of telling the truth'.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, urged voters to deliver their
verdict on a government which had 'broken its election promises and betrayed
the hopes of the people'.
The speeches came as the three main parties were embroiled in a fierce row
over the implications for Britain of the report produced by the Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and Development on the working of labour markets.
A clearly delighted Mr Major was joined by a phalanx of senior ministers in
insisting the report amounted to a ringing endorsement of the government's
emphasis on deregulated and flexible markets.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said the conclusions had
exposed Labour's commitment to a minimum wage as a recipe for job
destruction. But Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, led an opposition
counter-attack based on the OECD's call for flexible markets to be balanced
by greater emphasis on education and training.
In surprisingly confident mood at last night's rally and during earlier
media interviews, Mr Major insisted that the Conservatives had won all the
main arguments during the campaign.
His relatively relaxed demeanour appeared to reflect confidence at
Conservative Central Office that the heavy Tory defeat expected in
tomorrow's poll will not be as crushing as suggested by some opinion polls.
Party strategists believe the prospects are for the government to win closer
to 20 seats in the Strasbourg assembly than the five or six some have
projected.

Observer hears mixed reviews of the Geoffrey Burgon number - First Was The

tercentenary and gets its world premiere tonight.
A setting of a poem by Marvell, it involves several sharp lurches in tempo
and requires the 140-strong choir to do much lengthy and noisy humming.
However, the conductor, Sir David Willcocks, seems to have got the measure
of tonight's star-studded audience of more than 150 central bank governors.
He has reminded the choir performing the tricky number that the audience

Rarely has there been a finer array of parties to choose from than in
Thursday's UK version of the elections to the European Parliament. Pity only
50 per cent of Britons apparently know what the parliament is.
Never mind. Besides all the obvious dull worthies, Observer fancies the
chances of the 'Rainbow Connection Oui-Say-Non' party, though the choice of
four splinter versions of the ubiquitous 'Raving Loony' faction might
squeeze a vote here or there.
Fervent athletes might find a common front with the 'European People's Party
Judo/Christian Alliance'. Heinz employees could plausibly be deluded into
casting a glance towards the 'Eurobean from the planet Beanus' party. No
doubt a few angry parents will put a cross against the 'Network Against
Child Support Agency' party.
Though who will find themselves in sympathy with the Mccarthy-ites - the
'Make Criminals Concerned About Our Response to Hostility and Yobbishness'
party?
Oh, I see - expecting a mass turnout of disillusioned Tory voters . . .

So, fresh from a relaxing sojourn at his Normandy holiday home, Peter Lilley
has agreed to reappear in support of Britain's Tory government in its
European election campaign.
It seems the secretary of state for social security will now show up in
Bradford, bolstering the hopeless cause of the Conservative candidate in
that town's by-election. A hastily arranged programme - to persuade us his
absence in no way reflected his disdain for the European Union - will also
see Lilley visiting a factory in Leeds, as well as on walkabout in
Huddersfield.
Tory central office is deeply embarrassed at Euro-sceptic Lilley's
preference for a relaxing holiday over supporting the prime minister on the
stump. Not everyone shares that chagrin. 'We are better off without him,'
says one of Major's unhappy band of pro-European ministers.

<TEXT>
You can tell a bully - they are the ones who always pick fights with much
smaller people. Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the flamboyant Russian nationalist
politician, has selected a female Finnish journalist, Jutta Ziliacus, for
his latest punch-up. She apparently queried his mental fortitude in a recent
article; now he's suing her.
The man from Ivantheterribleograd is little-loved in Finland. He says the
Finns can have eastern Karelia back - they lost it to Russia in the Winter
war of 1939-40 - but the price will be that all Finland is reunited with
Russia. Zhirinovsky is also suing a Helsinki theatre, currently running a
farce entitled Mein Kampf by Hungarian dramatist George Taboris.
Zhirinovsky's lawyer claims the central character - Herr Schicklgruber
himself - spouts words taken from Zhirinovsky's speeches.
Damages of around Dollars 2.5m are being sought. But Zhirinovsky has shot
himself in the foot again. In Finland, at least, libel damages are usually
nominal.

FT  08 JUN 94 / Leading Article: How not to pick a Euro-leader
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Europe owes a great deal to Franco-German co-operation. Without the driving
force supplied by Bonn and Paris, the postwar community of European states
would never have flourished. Wisdom displayed by the two countries'
successive leaders has benefited the entire continent. One striking example
was President Francois Mitterrand's support for deployment of medium-range
nuclear missiles in Germany a decade ago. This strengthened Chancellor
Helmut Kohl's policies at a crucial time. Mr Mitterrand thus made an
important contribution to the eventual end of the cold war, paving the way
for German unification.
In spite of these successes, Bonn and Paris are not immune to mistakes. Mr
Mitterrand and Mr Kohl are making one now in their efforts to steer the
presidency of the European Commission towards Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the
Belgian prime minister. Having decided on their candidate, France and
Germany appear to be trying to impose him on the rest of the European Union,
in spite of reservations by countries such as Britain and Italy. The
objective of the campaign is misguided. Additionally, the way it is being
carried out runs counter to the principles on which the EU should be doing
business.
Vital role
The successor to Mr Jacques Delors will play a vital role in shaping the
European Union during the next five years. As it tries to improve members'
economic performance and deepen and widen existing integration, the
Commission needs to be made more efficient, more cohesive and more
persuasive.
The right candidate will require vision and ideas combined with
administrative skills and tough-minded negotiating ability. Mr Dehaene
appears to have won support from Mr Kohl, in particular, on the grounds of
his Christian Democrat party membership, his backing for political and
monetary union, and his adroit handling of the 1993 European summit in
Brussels. However important these attributes are, they are not sufficient to
guarantee him the job. Mr Dehaene is already discharging with tenacity the
difficult task of holding together his fractious Belgian coalition. Since
there are three other contenders for the Commission presidency, all with
relevant qualities which Mr Dehaene lacks, Europe would probably be best
served if the prime minister were to remain at his post.
European integrationist
Of the others in the running, Mr Ruud Lubbers, the Dutch prime minister, has
strong credentials as an Atlanticist and as a European integrationist. His
economic policy accomplishments during 12 years in government are
impressive. The Netherlands is one of the few countries close to fulfilling
the Maastricht criteria for economic and monetary union.
Sir Leon Brittan, the UK's senior EU commissioner, has a sceptical mind, but
is also a strong believer in the benefits of European union. His reputation
has been improved by his contribution to concluding the Uruguay Round. Mr
Peter Sutherland, director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade, and a former Brussels competition commissioner, is not a front runner
in the race. But, like Mr Lubbers and Sir Leon, he has a proven
international track record.
EU voters are preparing to go to the polls for the parliament elections on
June 9 and 12. Austrian voters look nervous about the EU ahead of this
weekend's referendum. Yet the horse-trading among governments about the
Union's new chief executive is taking place in secrecy. If the next
president is to give the Union the independent-minded, persuasive leadership
it needs, he or she needs to be the right person chosen in the right way.
That requires national leaders to state openly what they consider to be the
qualities required for the job and then for candidates to come forward
publicly, so that their merits can be examined and discussed.

FT  08 JUN 94 / Social chapter misread: David Goodhart argues UK
interpretations of European labour laws are unfair and misleading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European labour law is the issue that has most sharply divided the two main
parties in the UK's European election. But in so doing, it has become a
focus of rhetorical exaggeration and straightforward misunderstanding on
both sides.
In the course of the campaign, the social chapter, a voting mechanism which
makes it easier for the European Union to pass some types of employment
legislation, has been routinely and wrongly described in the UK as ushering
in a 35-hour week and a minimum wage.
Last week Mr John Major, the prime minister, attributed France's rising
unemployment to its acceptance of the social chapter and Britain's falling
unemployment to its rejection of it. This assertion belied the fact that not
a single piece of European employment legislation has been passed under the
terms of the social chapter.
The argument over workers' rights and conditions does overlap with genuine
domestic policy differences on labour market regulation. But neither the
existing framework of European employment law, nor proposed extensions to
it, can bear the weight of acclaim or disapproval heaped upon it by,
respectively, the Labour and Conservative parties.
There is 'much nonsense' talked in the UK about both the volume and the
nature of social legislation at a European level, says Mr Padraig Flynn,
social affairs commissioner in Brussels. More than 90 per cent of employment
legislation, and the costs associated with it, is determined by national
governments and not by Brussels. The three main areas where Europe has an
impact - health and safety, equality for men and women, and labour mobility
 -are all relatively uncontroversial.
Further, the din of hustings rhetoric has obscured the fact that the scope
of Europe's social ambitions is going through a subtle mutation or 'a period
of creative confusion', according to Mr Peter Reid, of the UK's Engineering
Employers Federation. A few months ago Mr Reid and others were worrying that
social legislation would be extended into national domains such as
individual redundancies.
Not any longer. The first clear step away from the agenda of detailed
Europe-wide legislation to protect those at work came last December with the
white paper of Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president, on growth,
competitiveness and employment. That paper - like yesterday's jobs study
from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development - called for
more flexible labour costs and for a better balance between protection of
the employed and access to work for the unemployed.
Mr Flynn's less noticed green paper on European social policy, which will
itself become a more formal white paper next month, is expected to mark a
further step away from detailed, prescriptive labour legislation.
In a recent speech, Mr Flynn said Europe's social dimension had established
a critical mass and now required less legislation. 'It is no longer
possible, or productive, to focus too narrowly on specific questions such as
labour law,' he added.
The scepticism of the UK government has had some effect in this debate and
there is growing interest in labour market deregulation throughout Europe.
But this does not mean that the social dimension is dead, or that Britain
has 'won the argument'.
Even after some deregulation, most EU countries will have more regulated
labour markets than the UK. Germany and Spain now see Europe-wide minimum
standards - on, for example, part-time worker rights - as a useful balance
to domestic deregulation.
Even in the UK, clashes over labour law seem set to continue at least for a
couple of years. Though the UK won an opt-out from future social chapter
legislation during the Maastricht treaty negotiations, the rump of 1980s
legislation coming into force now means that British workers are acquiring
new rights in maternity leave, working hours and part-time work.
These measures amount to a qualification, not a negation, of the
deregulatory policies of the Conservative government. For instance, Europe
has not prevented the abolition of minimum wage protection in the UK.
The above regulations, and the current batch of directives on matters such
as parental leave for childcare, represent the last gasp of 1980s social
Europe. Mr Flynn suggests the future will be more modest.
There will be more emphasis on implementing existing legislation (Greece has
implemented virtually no health and safety legislation), and more
sensitivity towards subsidiarity in the social field where, many argue,
decisions should remain at national level.
In the longer run there is likely to be more harmonisation of employment
standards and even pay rates in Europe, but this will probably be the result
of economic integration, not directives. It is also likely to involve
convergence between British deregulation and continental regulation. As Sir
Adrian Cadbury, chairman of the Cadbury inquiry into corporate governance,
said last week, talking about the company of the future, Britain will move
towards Europe in giving employees more rights, while Europe will move
towards Britain by doing the same for shareholders.

FT  08 JUN 94 / Better balance for loan arrangers: Falling profits from
corporate lending mean UK banks are seeking broader customer relationships
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For bankers who lend money to large companies in the UK, this has been an
unsettling year. Six months ago it appeared that the business, which was
hardly worth the candle by the end of the 1980s, had been revived. But banks
now face the return of hard times. 'We have managed to transform very thin
returns, but we are beginning to fall back over the edge,' says one banker.
The pressures have yet to hit published profits. Operating profits in the
Royal Bank of Scotland's corporate and institutional banking division were
Pounds 82m in the six months to March, compared with Pounds 58m in the same
period a year before, while National Westminster Bank's corporate and
investment banking arm, NatWest Markets, doubled profits last year. Yet this
earnings level is under pressure as banks compete for business.
The most obvious evidence is in the price of loans, which has fallen sharply
this year. Large companies which had to pay interest of 0.8 per cent (above
wholesale interest rates) on loans a year ago are now being charged closer
to 0.3 per cent. 'In the last six months, banks have given up half the
lending gains they made in the past six years,' says Mr Roger Byatt, deputy
chief executive of NatWest Markets.
Banks have found a distinct lack of enthusiasm for borrowing among large
companies, whose ability to tap capital markets more cheaply means they use
bank loans mainly as standby finance, similar to overdraft facilities for
individuals.
Furthermore, other services that banks have relied on heavily in the past
two years to compensate for low returns from lending - such as foreign
exchange contracts and financial derivatives - are under pressure. Less
volatility in European exchange and interest rates means banks are selling
fewer products and at lower margins.
The recognition that income from lending to large companies will probably
never recover to levels where it gives an acceptable return on capital has
galvanised banks. Following the example of other banks, Barclays' new chief
executive, Mr Martin Taylor, has just re-organised its corporate banking
services - ranging from lending to cash management and equity underwriting -
into a single group.
Mr Graham Pimlott, the Barclays executive who recently took charge of this
group, says that although UK banks have tried in the past few years to
improve corporate banking profits, they have not gone far enough. 'Lending
as a profitable business has been in decline for many years. US banks
responded to that in the 1980s, and it is slightly surprising that it took
us 10 more years to respond to it,' he says.
Lending profitability deteriorated sharply in the late 1980s, as competition
among strongly-capitalised banks reached a peak. One banker estimates that
banks need to charge about 1.4 per cent interest on loans to large companies
to make adequate returns on capital.
The fall in margins in the 1980s compounded other problems faced by British
banks in dealing with large companies. First, in contrast to continental
European banks, commercial and investment banking were divided. As large
companies raised more funds on capital markets, a growing proportion of
their business passed from commercial banks to investment banks.
A second problem was that their technology did not allow most banks to
calculate the total profits they made from each customer, the risks they
ran, and the costs they incurred. Many wanted to lend as much as possible,
even at low margins, to cover fixed costs. This drew them into making loans
to companies with which they did no other business, on terms which did not
earn a sufficient return on capital.
These risks were exposed when many large companies, such as Olympia &amp; York,
the Canadian property group, collapsed or had to be refinanced in the early
1990s.
The combination of large losses, and new capital requirements imposed by the
Basle-based committee of international bank supervisors, led many banks to
reshape their business with large companies. Mr Byatt says this process has
been so effective in NatWest's case that it has raised its earnings from
large companies to three times the level of the late 1980s.
Banks have been reforming their approach to large companies in several ways:
They have analysed the returns on capital of each relationship with a large
company - including services such as cash handling and lending. This has
shown that lending alone is no longer profitable enough. 'You have to gear
lending with other forms of income to make an adequate return on capital,'
says Mr David Harrison, head of corporate banking at Lloyds Bank.
They have ended relationships with companies which want only to borrow
money. NatWest Markets has reduced its customer base from a peak of 2,400 to
about 900.
Banks have played on the greater vulnerability of some recession-hit
customers by pointing out that they are more inclined to rescue those loyal
in good times. 'Banks find it harder to support clients who fall on hard
times if they were operating purely in a transactional way, and trying to
squeeze every last basis point from their bankers,' says Mr Byatt.
They have raised lending profits by adding higher-margin loans as old ones
have expired. They have been helped by the withdrawal of many Japanese banks
from the London market because of difficulties in their domestic markets in
1990.
But the strongest thrust has been to try to improve profits by selling more
products to companies, using the lending relationship as an introduction and
lever. Mr Iain Robertson, head of corporate and institutional banking for
Royal Bank, says his bank makes clear to companies merely wanting to borrow
that 'we intend to work with them in the longer-term to ensure we build a
profitable relationship'.
It is difficult for banks to do more than suggest that they deserve a slice
of more attractive business in return for a loan. There is strong
competition for the most profitable forms of wholesale banking. Companies
can insist on banks making loans before they consider buying other services,
such as foreign exchange contracts.
Moreover, not all other forms of banking activity are so profitable that
they make up for depressed lending margins. Mr Harrison of Lloyds argues
activities such as cheque clearing and cash handling are a valuable addition
to lending. But others argue such transactions are hardly more profitable
than lending.
Probably the greatest prize for commercial banks would be to persuade their
blue-chip clients to use them as investment banks as well as commercial
banks. If such borrowers sought corporate finance advice or asked their
banks to underwrite equity issues, the banks would have captured the most
profitable businesses from investment banks.
This is the rationale for National Westminster bringing its corporate and
investment banking operations together in NatWest Markets two years ago, and
for Mr Pimlott taking control of both corporate lending and merchant banking
within Barclays. Yet banks face difficulties in persuading UK companies to
accept advice, loans and underwriting from a single source. Many companies
are doubtful about the quality and independence of the advice they might
receive.
Even Mr Pimlott is cautious about the chances of short-term success, arguing
that it would be counter-productive to try to pressure companies to use the
whole range of products and services now under his remit. 'In my experience,
customers do not like people arriving and trying to force them to use one
service when they are quite happy using another,' he says.
Yet the pressures on banks such as Barclays and NatWest to induce companies
to buy such products will grow if they cannot sustain the recovery in
profits of the past two years. Mr Byatt of NatWest says the bank was
surprised by the rapidity with which it improved earnings after integrating
its lending and investment banking activities. But he admits that it will be
hard to maintain the momentum. As loan margins deteriorate and profits are
squeezed, the hard times of the late 1980s no longer seem so far away.

FT  08 JUN 94 / Leading Article: Ways to cure unemployment
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In the member states of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development unemployment stands at 35m, 8 1/2 per cent of the labour force.
This is the gravest economic failure and social problem they confront. That
is why the OECD secretariat was asked to prepare its study of employment and
unemployment. It is also why careful attention needs to be paid both to its
analysis and to its largely persuasive recommendations.
Inevitably, the subtleties are lost in the fevered British political debate.
All parties can claim some support from the OECD, although the Conservative
party's deregulatory approach wins the battle on points. The OECD insists,
for example, that statutory minimum wages 'often end up damaging employment
opportunities for unskilled labour'. Similarly, it remarks that employment
protection legislation 'can make employers more reluctant to hire new
workers'. Yet, faultlessly even-handed, it also points out that minimum
wages can be varied, by age or region, and that 'employment security can
encourage investment in on-the-job training'.
Such eclecticism can be irritating, but, in this case, it has virtues. For
this report shows not only how far performance diverges, but that virtually
all countries fail in at least one respect, while remedies must be
multi-dimensional, because the problem is. No single bullet will slay the
unemployment dragon.
Performance varies dramatically even within the European Union. In 1993, the
youth unemployment rate was only 4.9 per cent in Germany, but 24.6 per cent
in France. Female unemployment stood at 6.1 per cent in Germany and 8.1 per
cent in the UK, but at 28.9 per cent in Spain. The long-term unemployed were
59.0 per cent of the total in Belgium, but only 27.0 per cent in Denmark.
Markedly worse
For all that, overall EU employment performance was markedly worse than in
the US, or Japan. EU-wide youth unemployment stood at 20.6 per cent, for
example, as against 13.3 per cent in the US and 5.1 per cent in Japan. The
share of long-term unemployment stood at 42.2 per cent of the total in the
EU, but 11.2 per cent in the US. Employment has hardly grown in the EU since
1960, while it is up more than 80 per cent in North America.
Yet all is not well in the US. Real wages of low-paid workers fell by more
than 1 per cent a year in the 1980s, while wage differentials have risen
considerably. The US then has a real income problem, just as the EU has an
unemployment problem. Since the aims must be higher employment, lower
unemployment and higher real wages, this seems to create a nasty dilemma. Is
a growing army of the working poor a necessary result of successful policies
to promote employment?
Growing gap
The OECD is not that pessimistic. Naturally and rightly, it rejects
protectionism or policies to slow technological change. It insists, instead,
that 'the single most important cause of rising unemployment, as well as a
growing incidence of low-wage jobs, is a growing gap between the need for
OECD economies to adapt and innovate and their capacity and even will to do
so'.
Its array of policy recommendations include macroeconomic stability, faster
diffusion of technological know-how, increased flexibility of working time,
nurturing entrepreneurship, making wages and labour costs more adaptable to
market conditions, reforming employment security provisions, making labour
market policies more pro-active, improving skills and competences and, most
important of all, reforming benefit and tax systems, to ensure that social
objectives are achieved in ways that impinge less on efficient functioning
of labour markets.
Every country should examine all these policies, to improve the trade-off
between high employment, on the one hand, and rising and reasonably equal
real incomes, on the other. Yet dilemmas remain. Education and training are
long-term policies. In the meantime, jobs offered to the unskilled must be
profitable for employers, and remunerative to employees.
There are two possible strategies: restricting the availability of social
benefits or shifting them sharply towards job-promotion. The former is
ruthless, the latter expensive. A third possibility consists of leaving
things in the EU largely as they now are. But if EU members remain
determined to preserve their current welfare states and labour market
protection, they may find unemployment rising still further. In the long
term, that could well be the most socially damaging choice of all.

Sir, Samuel Brittan asserts that 'the proximate explanation for this hard
core (of structural unemployment) is that pay and related costs make workers
unprofitable to employ'. Actually, all that has happened is that more and
more women have sought to join the working population, particularly since
1970.
One reason is the high level of average and marginal taxation and national
insurance suffered by those in 'low paid jobs'. Hence, many of the hard core
of unemployed collect benefit but also work for cash.
The 'discussion' of full employment could usefully move on from monetary
policy, labour market details and social security to changes in tax
thresholds, including the pernicious national insurance contribution.

Sir, With reference to Samuel Brittan's excellent, if slightly technical,
article, 'Sad jubilee for a white paper' (Economic Viewpoint, June 2), why
not return to an old idea of 'negative income tax' with unemployment support
equal to personal allowances and permitted earnings equal to the earned
income allowance?
The latter could be increased in times of high activity, taking some of the
pressure off wage levels and increasing the 'pricing in' premium. It could
then be correspondingly reduced when recession threatens.
The whole could be simply administered (perhaps too simply to suit the
bureaucrats) and would at least partly relate costs to taxation revenue.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Recent portfolio flows have highlighted the Japanese savings surplus
and the savings deficit elsewhere in the world. If rising long bond yields
are not to jeopardise western growth, Japanese capital outflows need to be
resuscitated.
Lower Japanese interest rates would have this effect, particularly if they
also gave rise to the perception that the yen had peaked. Lower rates would
not necessarily be inflationary because some indices show prices are still
falling in Japan.
Lower rates could also re-liquefy the banking system in the same way that
they did in the US in the early 1990s. Together with a weaker currency,
lower interest rates would stimulate growth and demand for US exports.
Why, then, doesn't Japan cut interest rates and the US ameliorate demands
for managed trade?

FT  08 JUN 94 / Bizarre British novelty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK's Euro-campaign is unusual in focusing on European issues
According to the conventional wisdom, elections to the European Parliament
are not really about the European Parliament at all: they are a series of
lukewarm national plebiscites, which have some relevance to national
politics but not much to Europe. The voters know little about the Strasbourg
assembly, and care rather less, fundamentally because the election of the
European Parliament does not lead to the formation of a European government.
A Euro-campaign is really just an extension of national politics.
That's the conventional wisdom, and as far as it goes it is generally true.
In Germany, this week's Euro-vote is a dry run before the federal elections
in the autumn; and in France it is the last national vote before the
presidential elections next spring.
But what's new and interesting is that the conventional wisdom does not seem
to be operating quite so well in Britain. This week's vote is supposed to be
a plebiscite on the domestic standing of John Major and the Conservative
government. But if so, why has the campaign been hijacked by arguments over
Europe? Why have the politicians been harping on about the single currency
and the opt-outs, about variable geometry and the national veto? Why has Mr
Major scarcely been able to let a day pass without giving some new
definition of his multispeed, multi-layered vision of Europe? Contrary to
the conventional wisdom, this Euro-election campaign has been dominated by
European issues.
On the face of it, this is a bizarre novelty. In the past, politicians
treated Europe as something alien which happened 'over there'. Where it
could not be reduced to mercantilist arguments about the British budget
rebate, it could safely be trivialised as an atavistic jousting match
against all those foreigners.
In this year's Euro-debate, however, we have heard much less of such breezy
sporting metaphors. And the reason, perhaps, is that it is becoming
increasingly clear that the Maastricht treaty, dreadful experience though it
may have been, was not the end of the story, not by a long chalk. It was Mr
Major, if you recall, who summed up the 253 pages of the treaty in the
memorable words: 'Game, set and match to Britain.' The phrase implied a
triumphant, or at least a defiant, finality about that marathon. It now
seems probable that the 1996 Inter-Governmental Conference (IGC) to revise
Maastricht will be even more gruelling than Maastricht.
It will be especially gruelling for the UK, because the British government
seems to be getting further and further out of step with its major partners.
Mr Major is arguing for a fluid, amoeba-like Europe; but the Germans are
pressing for a more integrated Europe, and it is they who will set the
agenda, because they are now the leaders of the majority of member states.
No doubt they will be rejoined by their traditional French allies, once the
French have elected a new president and (with luck) resolved the schism over
Europe inside the conservative coalition. But for the moment the Germans
will call the tune.
The tune they are calling is uncompromisingly integrationist. Karl Lamers,
the foreign policy spokesman of the ruling Christian Democrat party, openly
calls for the drafting of a European constitution to define who does what.
British Euro-sceptics tend to pooh-pooh the Lamers line, on the grounds that
he is an unrepresentative Euro-federalist; and the people in the
chancellor's office in Bonn explicitly disclaim any intention of pressing
for a European constitution. But when you listen to what they say in detail,
it's hard to see what else they mean.
I talked to a very senior official in Germany last week: 'No,' he said, 'we
don't want a constitution; we must just make improvements in the Maastricht
treaty. But in 1996 we must try to divide the policy competences between the
Community and the member states more precisely.' The Germans are no doubt
anxious not to set off the alarm bells in London; but this sounds like the
beginnings of a federal constitution under another name.
In detail, the Germans want a much stronger European Parliament, and a
strengthening of foreign policy co-operation. They will also press for much
closer co-operation on police, justice and immigration policies, by
transforming them from issues of inter-governmental co-operation to full
European Union status.
Moreover, Chancellor Helmut Kohl remains unrepentantly committed to a single
European currency, sooner or later; and now the head of the Bundesbank has
called for closer political and monetary links between an inner core of the
member states, as a precondition for any further enlargement to the east.
In the light of all that is known about the priorities of Germany and a
majority of the other member states, it is baffling that John Major should
deliberately have manoeuvred himself, in this Euro-election campaign, into a
position which guarantees the maximum conflict with Britain's partners in
the coming IGC.
'In 1996,' says a very senior Brussels diplomat, 'there are only four
possible outcomes. We may have a new tight treaty; and the British will opt
out of it. We may have a new loose treaty: and an inner core of states will
go ahead without the British. We may have a multispeed treaty; and the
British will opt for the slow lane. Or we may have a complete breakdown.'
In other words, he already discounts any possibility of Britain keeping up
with the pace of integration. This may seem a pity; but at least we are
having a debate about it, even in a European Parliament election campaign.

FT  08 JUN 94 / The FT Interview: Sceptic with a hint of enthusiasm -
Antonio Martino, Italy's foreign minister
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is a curious irony that the first European government to be headed by a
media magnate should have an image problem.
But the month-old Italian government of Silvio Berlusconi is struggling to
shrug off the negative international impact of containing five ministers
from the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance.
Much of the flak falls on the shoulders of Antonio Martino, the free-market
economist and political novice who has taken over as foreign minister.
'We made a mistake in not paying sufficient attention to the foreign press
(during the election campaign),' Mr Martino concedes.
Having just spent much of Monday fielding queries on hostile comments made
against the MSI by Mr Jacques Delors, president of the EU Commission, and an
Israeli junior minister, Mr Martino is remarkably sanguine.
He attributes the attacks on the neo-fascists to attempts by European
socialists to score points in the run-up to this weekend's European
elections. 'We are in a pre-electoral atmosphere,' he says. 'After Monday,
things should begin to quieten down.'
Though feeling his way and distracted by having to convince Italy's
international partners of the government's democratic credentials, Mr
Martino clearly relishes the opportunity to put his ideas into practice. He
is an economist trained in Chicago under Milton Friedman, who caught Mr
Berlusconi's eye writing opinionated free market articles some 18 months
ago. Right until the end of the campaign for the March general elections, he
was Mr Berlusconi's economic adviser and looked set to be the next treasury
minister.
Nevertheless, diplomacy runs in the blood. His father, Gaetano, was the
Christian Democrat foreign minister who signed the articles of the Treaty of
Rome, while his cousin, Ferdinando Salleo, is a career diplomat.
Mr Martino is the first Italian foreign minister since the Treaty of Rome to
question the European ideal. It would be surprising if his forthright views
do not shape new Italian policies towards the Union.
'In Italy I'm considered a Euro-sceptic; but in Britain I would probably be
considered a Euro-enthusiast,' he says of his membership of the
Thatcher-inspired Bruges Group. A convinced Anglophile, married to an
American, he champions a more pragmatic approach to the consolidation of the
EU. 'The Maastricht treaty is not a bible.'
Mr Martino is also critical of the Euro-socialist thinking behind the social
chapter. 'It may be motivated by lofty ideals but it produces some perverse
results.' He attributes Italy's high unemployment directly to unnecessary
rigidities in the labour market, although the hire and fire laws were
intended to protect the workers.
Yet he is by no means anti-EU: rather he is deeply critical of the
unquestioning pro-Europeanism of previous Italian governments. 'Italy said
yes to everything but then was not necessarily able to implement,' he says,
citing Italy's inability to comply with milk quotas.
He dislikes the dirigiste aspect of Brussels. Governments, he says, should
be free to determine their own regulations to avoid the kind of bruising
national arguments over the 'Euro-sausage' or 'convergent size of condoms'.
'In the EU we have created institutions without strategies (for their use) .
. . It's like buying a computer without knowing how to use it. First you
must choose the software, then the hardware . . . If we believe in Europe we
have to ask why.'
Europe, he insists, must be demonstrably for the public good. He sees five
elements of common benefit - the single market, a common currency, a common
foreign policy, a common defence policy, and the need for a genuine court of
appeal/ombudsman to which citizens can resort.
He supports the single market but warns it must be able to make guarantees
against protectionism among individual members. On the advantages of a
common currency he is more sceptical.
'If - and it is a big if - I can have guarantees that the common currency
will not be mismanaged, then I'm in favour.' The common currency would be
beneficial, he claims, because it would reduce the cost of transactions,
help stabilise international currency markets and be an alternative to the
dollar, while also acting as a symbol of European unity.
'A common currency is desirable although it is not absolutely essential for
the single market . . . It requires an indivisible solution - ie: it cannot
be done step by step.'
On a common European foreign policy, Mr Martino is wary of forming axes
within Europe such as that between France and Germany. An axis means a
return to 'conventional diplomacy with favoured partners'. To counter the
latest moves by France and Germany towards tightening their co-operation, he
is aware Italy might be tempted to make common cause with the UK and Spain.
The first test of Italy's Euro-diplomacy will be the forthcoming choice of a
successor for Mr Delors. Instinctively Mr Martino would prefer Sir Leon
Brittan, the trade commissioner, or Mr Peter Sutherland, the Irish candidate
and Gatt head. Such figures, or a compromise candidate, are needed to embody
a new post-Maastricht approach to union. But the Italian government has yet
to make up its mind.
Italy, Mr Martino says, should be more prepared to be more opinionated on a
range of issues. 'One should say exactly what one feels about policy. In
this I admire Mrs Thatcher, even if she may have overdone it on occasions.'
This underscores the desire of Mr Martino - and that of Mr Berlusconi - to
raise Italy's international profile. One problem here is that Italy, despite
its size and membership of Nato, has poorly equipped armed forces.
Successive governments when looking for spending cuts always turned to the
defence budget, he laments.
'The defence ministry now spends less than the regional government of
Sicily,' he observes. If Italy is to play a bigger international role, it
must have the military means - 'but I don't want to sound militaristic'.
He is bitter at the way Italy has been left to play second fiddle over
events in the neighbouring states of former Yugoslavia. Italy has been
excluded from the contact group formed between the US, Russia and the EU.
'We cannot be answerable for decisions to which we are not a party,' he
says.
Behind this treatment of Italy lies a complex debate over whether troops
should be sent to ex-Yugoslavia. Mr Martino lays down four conditions for
this to happen: a peace plan must be accepted by all interested parties;
this peace plan must be backed by the United Nations; the UN must request
Italian troops; and the troops should then be under Nato command.
In all his answers, Mr Martino behaves as if he is master in his own house.
'I think Berlusconi shares some of my Euro-scepticism. He trusts me and
expects me to take care of this area of policy. As a businessman he is
accustomed to the idea of delegating responsibility.'

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Sir, Nothing emphasises more the misunderstanding by Stephen Dorrell,
financial secretary to the Treasury, of the financing of publicly quoted
companies than his weekend statement that 'it may be right for Glaxo and ICI
to distribute as they do but it isn't right for an expanding high-tech firm
with a capitalisation of Pounds 50m'.
I have been in the City a long time, but I cannot recall too many expanding
high-tech firms noted for their high pay-outs.
Perhaps Mr Dorrell could produce a list. It would be a very short one.

FT  08 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Water company gearing should be
questioned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Y KOVACH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Lex concludes (May 30) that the ability of water companies to meet the
efficiency targets of Ofwat, the regulator, is what matters to shareholders.
Not for him to inquire why an industry with the highest quality of earnings
is so lowly geared? The combination of an indispensable product and captive
customers cries out for the maximum of cheap debt finance and the minimum of
expensive equity. Instead, we have the alchemy of water into gold, a
regulated high-reward, albeit risk-free, industry.
Today's customers are being doubly milked to provide shareholders with a
generous dividend pay-out and, through substantial retained earnings, much
of the equity for projects to improve water quality and the environment for
the next generation of customers.
Ofwat should derail this low risk/high reward gravy train by calculating its
'inflation minus x per cent' water charge formula on the assumption that
most of the ring-fenced capital employed is financed with index-linked
bonds. In order to minimise the need for interest cover, Ofwat should state
the obvious - monopoly water suppliers do not go bankrupt and hence will
always be allowed to meet their debt payments. Equity's role would be
diminished to that of ensuring effective management. Ofwat would then be
able to fine tune the water charge formula so as handsomely to reward
shareholders of well-managed water companies at little cost to customers. Y

FT  08 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: UK needs restructured welfare system,
not lower benefit levels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr RICHARD THOMAS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Joe Rogaly ('Hand-up, not hand-out', June 7) is right to say that 'any
promise of full employment would be hollow without some reform of the
welfare system'. He is wrong to conclude that this means settling for less
welfare if we want more people in jobs.
A Commission on Social Justice report to be published next week shows it is
the structure and administration of benefits, rather than their level, which
affects employment. And the existing benefits system in the UK needs reform
in order to make work pay. This does not imply promoting a downwards
competition between wages and benefits at the bottom of the labour market.
It does, however, imply tackling the outdated notions of a 'family wage'
inherent in the current benefits structure and easing the transition from
out-of-work to in-work benefits.
There is not a sterile choice between more or less welfare and more or less
labour market regulation. The real challenge is to shape regulation and
welfare to fit today's world.

<TEXT>
Sir, As someone reared on the banal journalistic diet, with scarce news and
abundant comment, highlighted in 'A dull day in Germany is. . .' (June 5/6),
I know James Morgan missed the obvious reasons: German journalists seem to
knock off work at the latest by 5pm and late-breaking stories just do not
get into the next morning's newspaper.
I have to get my late German news out of the Financial Times and
International Herald Tribune. German journalists also seem to dislike
leg-work to dig out the real story behind the story and prefer to sit behind
their desks to compose the abundant comment.

FT  08 JUN 94 / Arts: The Chicago, Mullova and the LSO - Concerts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On Saturday the Chicago Symphony hit town, with their usual loud report. A
special attraction was the local premiere of the Partita commissioned from
Elliott Carter (at 85 indisputably America's grandest old composer), but a
more general attraction must have been its famous brass. And on Sunday, Kent
Nagano conducted the London Symphony in the first of three concerts
featuring Stravinsky's three great Diaghilev ballets.
There, however, the special attraction was Viktoria Mullova in Berg's Violin
Concerto, more 'advanced' music than any we have heard this ex-Soviet
virtuoso attempt. In both concerts, as it turned out, the less special
pieces proved the most satisfying ones. Mullova's Berg was no more than a
thin, uncommitted pencil-sketch, technically superb but devoid of any
Expressionist feeling.
Along with the Lyric Suite and Lulu, the Concerto represents Berg's genius
for making Schoenberg's abstract dodecaphonic methods serve passionate,
post-Mahlerian ends. It was sad to hear its solo role reduced to grey
note-spinning. If Miss Mullova thought her cautious first draft ready for
public performance, her Soviet training must have left her innocently deaf
to Berg's expressive climate.
I felt much the same about Daniel Barenboim's swift, unbending Chicago
version of Strauss's Till Eulenspiegel. Before Till there had been witty
music for centuries (Scarlatti, Haydn, Mozart), and a sprinkling of 'jokes';
but for Till Strauss devised a new comical-musical body-language - jaunty,
wriggly, mock-explosive: like a puppy doing practice growls and pounces -
which needs room for expanding and rollicking. On Barenboim's tight
metronomic leash, it sounded stiff and steely. We had to be content with
brilliant execution, mostly at forte and upwards.
All that was unsatisfying about Carter's Partita was that we were hearing it
for the first time. Experience says that the grand plan of any substantial
Carter work comes into focus only with longer acquaintance. Here the old
master's music dances and dazzles in profuse variety, more leanly scored
than most of his earlier orchestral stuff. He plays the distinct
instrumental families off against one other, each with their own prickly
material - upper and lower strings, woodwinds, brass, percussion - in
cyclical juxtapositions which never come out in the same way.
Barenboim ran through the ingenious patterns tautly and urgently.
Sprightlier and less brittle would have been better (and will be, when other
orchestras take the piece up). For the strings, the music needed more
playing in: their subfusc sound indicated a collective uncertainty about
pitching and phrasing. Though the Chicago Brahms' Second had similar
failings, it was impossible not to respond to its big, confident sound and
glorious brass-chordings.
The LSO played young Stravinsky's complete Firebird - the luxuriant 1910
original, with quadruple woodwind (including two contrabassoons), three
harps and lashings of magical pianissimo - even better. It is always a
pleasure to be reminded of the rich, cogent interconnections that the
familiar Suites miss out; but here Nagano treated the ballet-pantomime links
with such searching sympathy, so vividly detailed, that the score seemed a
rousing, integral whole. His Petrushka and Rite of Spring with the LSO,
Thursday and Sunday next, should be terrific.

The extent to which the BBC is still locked into the political fashions of
the 1960s can be judged from the fact that the Adam Smith Institute is
regarded as a suitable candidate for the access slot Open Space. Out in the
real world the political high ground has been held for 20 years by people
who argue that the cradle to grave welfare state was a fond but dangerous
idea, a pastel pink version of communism, which destroyed individual
initiative and created a dependency culture. But at the BBC such ideas are
still regarded as so quaint and novel that, even as late as 1994, it is felt
right to offer special space for these weird and wonderful notions to be
explained (7.00 BBC2).
It should be a good evening for drama. ITV's Peninsular War series, Sharpe,
has been swashing its buckle in a most satisfactory manner and today the
rough diamond rifleman falls for another beautiful woman: the Marquesa
Dorada, played by Alice Krige (8.00). BBC2's 'Screen Two' production is A
Landing On The Sun, adapted from a funny and gripping novel about the
oddness of civil service life, by Michael Frayn (9.00).

<TEXT>
Television's habit of overdoing things is now chronic. Whether it is World
Cup football or the 50th anniversary of D-Day, the rule is to supply more
material than the most fanatical enthusiast could possibly want. The reason
is surely clear: television executives may insist they are thinking of the
viewers but, consciously or sub-consciously, they are actually thinking of
their bosses and their competitors. The big question becomes 'What will they
do that I'm not doing, and how can I outdo them?' Of all the D-Day material
I saw, the two best programmes were among the most conventional.
D-Day: Turning The Tide on BBC1, was produced by Mark Fielder and presented
by Charles Wheeler. It used the simple device of getting some of those who
participated, and survived, to describe their experiences to camera, with an
inlaid photograph (printed in sepia even though sepia went out of fashion
round about 1920; for today's young programme makers sepia just means 'old')
showing how they looked in 1944.
It was enthralling and moving because of the detail: the Para commander who
found his troop-carrying glider was too heavy, called for a volunteer to
stay behind, failed to get one, and jettisoned some gear instead; the marine
raised in awe of naval officers who saw a captain standing, though the
marine did not realise it, on the deck of a midget submarine at periscope
level, leading the landing craft in to the beach, who whispered 'Jesus, they
really do walk on water'; and the Normandy woman who witnessed the start of
the huge Allied naval bombardment and raced back to her family saying 'The
sea is firing. I come to die with you'.
Given the dreadful lack of original programmes on satellite television, it
is good to be able to report that the other memorable documentary was
Normandy: The Great Crusade produced by the Discovery channel. The style
here was even more conventional, but the programme had two strengths: it was
made almost entirely from archive film, and it presented evidence as readily
from French and German survivors as from the invaders. Much of television's
D-Day material was remarkably jingoistic, but this was an admirably academic
piece of work.
The frequency with which television now launches new series about
'idiosyncratic' detectives is absurd. Two weeks ago it was Derek Jacobi's
new-age mediaeval monk, Cadfael. Last week, on BBC1, it was Glaswegian
Charlie King, The Negotiator who (you will not believe this) is hard boiled,
streetwise, a loner, hates desk work, fights his own bosses as well as the
bad guys, and commands the respect of the villains. Can you believe that
anybody could be so unoriginal? Brian Cox takes the title role. The last
time he played such a character was when he took the title role in Grushko .
. . last month.
Political correctness seems to have a frightening hold over more and more
BBC journalism. Traditionally one of the key functions of the journalist has
been to stand aside and say, as it were, 'I know you people and the church
and the king and all those scientists insist that the earth is flat, but
where is your evidence?' and to go on asking even if - particularly if -
told that the truth is obvious to anyone with eyes in their head. Instead of
feeding us the politically correct Bel Mooney line on roads ('There are now
enough by-passes for me so nobody else should be allowed to have one')
Public Eye on BBC2 would have been better employed doing a proper social
audit on road building.
However, the worst example last week was not just politically correct but a
striking example of the sort of sanctimonious tabloid journalism which is
now moving out of the small square newspapers and onto the small square
screen. Inside Story on BBC1 pursued a man whom it accused of sexually
abusing teenage boys. It did not set out to report on sexual relations
between adults and children generally; had it done so, it might have begun
with the fact that the ancient Greeks, to many the cynosure of civilisation,
saw love between man and boy as the real thing and adult heterosexual
intercourse as a dutiful necessity for the continuation of the race.
Today, in the age of feminism, you are nothing if not a self proclaimed
victim, so the Greek ideal is reversed, as in this programme, and becomes
'paedophilia'. No attempt was made to establish whether, as fashion now
dictates, making love with children really is the most damaging crime of
all. It is politically correct to assume that and so the programme used
every cheap trick in the book - from mood music to repetitive shots of sad
children's faces in big closeup - to purvey emotion rather than analysis.
The first time ITV's rugby commentator in Pretoria used the expression on
Saturday I could scarcely believe it. 'And there goes Charlie Farnsbarns,
b*llocking forward]' he exclaimed. When he said it again I realised that the
word was 'bullocking', and that it was being used to mean charging straight
into the opposition (on the crash ball, as Bill McLaren says). It would seem
advisable to avoid this new minted verb in future. First it sounds exactly
like the much more familiar but far ruder word and, second, bullocks seem
more given to skipping around like spring lambs than charging like bulls.
On the subject of sports commentators, it is time that somebody - the
exemplary Richie Benaud, perhaps - told Geoffrey Boycott that the art of
commentary does not consist in repeating the same grumpy insults over and
over again, and that if you have nothing fresh to say it might be best to
keep quiet for a bit. When New Zealand began their second innings at Trent
Bridge on Sunday, Boycott, speaking for Grandstand on BBC1, made very clear
his chagrin when Devon Malcolm failed to take a wicket in the first few
overs. Then he made it clear again. Then again. Boycott is not enough of a
linguistic wizard to make such repetition interesting.

Dennis Potter, the greatest British dramatist of his generation, and perhaps
the best television writer that the world has yet seen, died yesterday from
cancer. He was 59. He will be remembered best for his television serials
Pennies From Heaven and, above all, The Singing Detective. In these he used
the popular songs of the 1930s, '40s and '50s to recapture the spirit of an
age and, more significantly, as a route into the internal landscape of the
mind.
This area, previously the territory of writers such as Proust and Joyce and
painters such as Bosch and Magritte, was explored by Potter in the course of
a prolific television career which began with The Confidence Course in 1965
and has not yet ended. Told that the cancer would kill him, he set out some
months ago in a race against death to complete Karaoke and Cold Lazarus, two
new serials, one about cryogenics and the other about virtual reality. At
his request a unique arrangement has been made for one to be originated next
year on the BBC with repeats on Channel 4 and the other to be originated by
Channel 4 with repeats on the BBC.
Born in the Forest of Dean, the son of a miner, Potter went to Oxford as a
scholarship boy. Later in life he said of his university career 'You know
what you gain easily enough - exams, Oxford, the chance to walk around with
Dostoevsky under your arm - but it takes longer to find out what you've
lost'.
The recording of what had been lost dominated Potter's work, much of which
was autobiographical (more so than he wanted to admit) and deeply English.
There were the personal losses of a man born into a family of working class
Christians who embraced the Labour politics of the Attlee era; and the
national losses of someone whose generation had seen the end of the British
Empire, the horrors of the second world war, and the spread of Coca Cola
imperialism which both fascinated and horrified Potter.
From Oxford he joined the BBC as a general trainee, but he fell out very
soon over his writing for the left wing New Statesman and departed the BBC
to join the Labour newspaper, the Daily Herald. In 1965 he wrote his first
four television dramas, the last two inspired by his experiences as a
working class graduate attempting to become a Labour MP, the Nigel Barton
plays. In the following six years more than a dozen of his dramas were
screened, most, though not all, by the BBC. They included Where The Buffalo
Roam, Son Of Man and Angels Are So Few, and were concerned with man as a
spiritual, sexual and political being - usually in that order.
In 1971 came the incurable disease, psoriatic arthropathy, affecting the
joints and the skin, which forced Potter more than ever to rely upon his
inner resources. On the rare occasions when he appeared in public one of his
contorted fists invariably contained a smoking cigarette. His work, which
had always created controversy now began to cause major national rows. In
Brimstone And Treacle one of Potter's favourite figures, the in-coming
stranger, turns out to be the devil incarnate who figuratively rapes the
family's middle class sensibilities and literally rapes the mentally damaged
daughter. BBC director-general Alasdair Milne banned it and it took 11 years
to reach the screen.
What with that and other works which asked agonised and agonising questions
about the spiritual underpinnings of Christianity, and the sexual
explicitness of dramas such as Casanova, Potter became the bete noir of the
'Clean Up TV' people. It was a classic confrontation between the
individualistic artist, driven to open up and examine what it means to be
human and to communicate the answers as vividly as possible, and the group
of fearful onlookers in which the instinct is to collude and suppress, to
muffle and gag the frightening evidence offered by the non-conformist.
Potter won the battle in glorious fashion by producing work such as Pennies
From Heaven and The Singing Detective which, while still profoundly
concerned with the condition of humanity, was also among the most
entertaining drama ever seen on television. However good Karaoke and Cold
Lazarus may be, The Singing Detective from 1986 will always be seen as a -
arguably the - chief milestone in the first 50 years of the development of
television drama. An engrossingly complex through-composition on several
levels of consciousness, it speaks of childhood and family roots, love and
loss of innocence in a a deeply moving way. Yet it is, too, wonderfully
funny.
Dennis Potter's wife, Margaret, died only last week. He leaves a son and two
daughters.

FT  08 JUN 94 / Arts: A very cultivated 'Falstaff' - Opera at the Holland
Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The trick of going to the opera in Amsterdam is to catch the Royal
Concertgebouw Orchestra on one of its periodic visits to the Muziektheater.
Riccardo Chailly is the orchestra's Music Director and it was an obvious
step to employ this Italian man of the theatre and his orchestra as a team:
they opened the Holland Festival last week with a new production of Verdi's
Falstaff.
This opera is the most musically rewarding of all the Italian comedies. It
is worth keeping its nationality in mind. Although Falstaff may be one of
the great characters of the English theatre, Verdi bestowed upon him a kind
of honorary Italian citizenship. In the 1960s and 70s the contrast was made
clear by the leading Falstaffs of the day: Geraint Evans the figure of fun,
the Italian Tito Gobbi more dignified and restrained.
Sometimes the opera opens with a raucous guffaw from the brass, but nothing
so vulgar was allowed in Chailly's performance. As always, he kept a
watchful eye on every detail and the music came across as remarkably
cultivated, its subtle blend of colours and pinpoint precision beautifully
realised by the Concertgebouw players. What he missed was the rude energy
that is just a much a part of Falstaff's character.
Taking its cue from the musical performance, Llus Pasqual's production
refused to lower itself to any knockabout fun. It would seem that the budget
restricted the designer, Ezio Frigerio, to two sets, the first a huge barn
stacked with bundles of hay, which had the sole advantage of not being any
more inappropriate for one scene than another. The closing tableau moved to
Windsor Great Park, where Herne's oak was surrounded by what looked like
silver birch trees.
Given a strong team of personalities, one would not mind if the opera was
played on bare boards, but Pasqual did not ask much of his singers and they
in turn gave him little. Bruno Pratico sang the Italian words with relish -
every syllable of 'Quand'ero paggio' delightfully inflected - but he is too
young to be a Falstaff. With his slim baritone and his lightweight manner,
he cannot command much in the way of corpulent authority. Inevitably, he
seemed a character without a past.
There was an array of young Italians in the other roles, including Roberto
Servile with an attractive baritone but a personality one size too small for
Ford and Daniela Dess as his wife, cutting through the orchestra with her
strident soprano. Anna Steiger's Meg Page actually seemed to be enjoying
herself. Serena Lazzarini made an irritating Mistress Quickly, forever
putting on airs in a role that asks for down-to-earth, good-hearted honesty.
Patrizia Pace sang a bright and nicely poised Nannetta, paired with a gauche
Fenton in Jose Bros.
As an ensemble they had tangible virtues: all had been carefully rehearsed
to sing (never shout) their music, to point the words clearly, to observe
the details of Verdi's score. On a recording, these good points might add up
to a recommendable performance. In the theatre, they just made a rather dull
evening of Falstaff.
Further performances ending June 24

FT  08 JUN 94 / People: Peacock leaves for New York and BZW
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ian Peacock, 46, who has spent 19 years with Kleinwort Benson, is moving to
New York to be co-head of merchant banking in the US for BZW, Barclays
Bank's investment banking arm.
Barclays Bank has had a chequered history in the US. Just over a year ago it
gave BZW strategic responsibility for the group's US operations, including
day-to-day management of its large corporate lending. The reorganisation was
in response to an increasing trend for large companies and institutions to
raise funds from equity and bond markets rather than through bank borrowing.
Peacock's move to BZW follows a reorganisation at Kleinwort Benson and a
chance airport encounter with Graham Pimlott, 44, a former colleague, now
chief executive of merchant banking at BZW who has recently taken on an
expanded role within Barclays.
BZW does not disclose the size of its US banking business, but it is known
to be many times larger than the Pounds 2bn or so that Peacock was jointly
responsible for at KB. Peacock ran the marketing side of KB's North American
banking business between 1984 and 1987 before returning to the UK to be
joint head of the group's lending operation. In his new role he will be
primarily responsible for BZW's bank finance and structured finance products
in the US. The other co-head of merchant banking in the US is Malcolm Le
May, 36, who joined BZW in 1991 after stints at Drexel Burnham and Morgan
Grenfell.
Peacock is the latest ex-Kleinwort Benson banker to move to BZW. The best
known is Sir Martin Jacomb, who spent 17 years with KB before helping form
BZW in 1986. When Pimlott quit KB in 1989 he took with him Callum McCarthy,
who now heads BZW's Japanese business.

FT  08 JUN 94 / People: Geoffrey Woodroffe to preside over grief and
grievance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's funeral business is getting its first Ombudsman, Professor
Geoffrey Woodroffe, director of the centre for consumer and commercial law
research at Brunel University.
Woodroffe's new part-time appointment will entail his scrutinising
complaints from families who are dissatisfied with services provided by
funeral parlours belonging to either the Funeral Standards Council or the
Funeral Planning Council, which together account for about half of the
country's 4,000 funeral directors.
These two professional bodies have largely displaced the older National
Association of Funeral Directors, which, established in 1979 in order to
bring greater transparency to the business, was criticised by the Office of
Fair Trading in 1989.
The Ombudsman's function has teeth, notably the power to order companies to
pay compensation up to Pounds 50,000 to claimants whose grievances are
upheld. The office is able to receive complaints backdated to - but not
beyond - April 4 this year. The funeral business in the UK is worth some
Pounds 1bn annually, with around 640,000 funerals taking place each year.
Woodroffe is a solicitor by training and has broad experience of commercial
law both in the UK and through his diverse work for the European Commission.
The Ombudsman's council has a team of six (besides Woodroffe himself)
including: Jill Moore, chairman; Peter Gibson; Cassandra Kent; Cynthia
McDowell; Alan Edwards; and Gordon Kee.
The council will be promoting its work through citizens' advice bureaus and
other public forums.

Brent Walker group.
Sir Marcus' appointment as a non-executive director is a further sign that
one of Britain's biggest pub-owners is likely to be floated on the stock
market over the next year or two. Last year it made operating profits of
Pounds 11.1m on sales of Pounds 100m. Pubmaster chairman John Brackenbury,
58, said that Sir Marcus has an impressive track record in industry as well

FT  08 JUN 94 / Management: Use your intuition - Rationality is in retreat
as a business tool
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Einstein once declared: 'I never discovered anything with my rational mind.'
On another occasion he claimed that 'imagination is more important than
knowledge'. In practice, he used a combination of reason and intuition.
Edwin Land, the founder of Polaroid, the US photography group, worked in
very similar fashion. So, in many respects, do innovative modern leaders
such as Ingvar Kamprad, founder of Swedish-based furniture retailer Ikea,
the Benetton family of the Italian clothing group, and even some
ultra-numerate Americans - notably Jack Welch of General Electric of the US.
They use intuition not just occasionally, to generate 'visions' for their
company's future strategy, but also in everyday decision making.
Yet, for more than 30 years, a management world whose prime task should be
the creation of businesses has treated intuition as a dirty word.
Marginalised by the rise of 'scientific', ultra-rational management -
especially in strategic analysis and planning - intuition became associated
with a discredited, uninformed style of management known as
'seat-of-the-pants'.
But now, as companies search for ways of creating more businesses, and with
excessive rationality in retreat after more than a decade of strategic
planning disasters, intuition is making a comeback.
The problem is how to integrate it with the rigour and deep understanding of
markets, technologies, strategy and competitive behaviour which managers
need at a time of global competition, complexity, uncertainty and rapid
change.
In the last few months two books have been published which extol the virtues
of intuition, try to explain it, and advise how it can be exploited.
One, called Intuition - The New Frontier of Management*, comes from three
authors connected with the International Institute for Management
Development in Lausanne.
Among the many findings of the book - and of a nine-country international
survey which it contains - is that Japanese managers are much more intuitive
than they realise (or admit), while Swedes are far less so than they think.
Americans and Britons rate pretty high objectively, and know it. The study
shows that women are far more intuitive than men.
The other book** comes from Henry Mintzberg, a Canadian professor known
worldwide for his 20-year campaign against the excesses and failures of much
past planning.
As Mintzberg demonstrates, most of the influential corporate planning
literature of the past 30 years, from the pioneering Igor Ansoff in the
1960s to Harvard's Michael Porter in the 1980s, - extols pure rationality in
place of 'gut feel'.
The IMD book, written by an Indian company managing director, Jagdish
Parikh, with two academics, Friedrich Neubauer and Alden Lank, tries to
explain in simple language what intuition is - and is not - and suggests
practical ways of using it profitably.
In the past, it argues, managers sometimes resorted to intuition because of
inadequate data or information. Now computers churn out so much information
that the use of intuition is essential in order to make sense of it quickly.
Conventional mental activities - absorption of information, retention and
reasoning - are now inadequate.
As Parikh and his co-authors argue, it is an innovative, largely intuitive,
grasp of the evolving global marketplace which has transformed businesses
such as Sony, the consumer electronics company and car makers BMW and Honda,
into giants. Creativity of this kind seldom results from convergent,
analytical thinking, they maintain. It is more the result of divergent
thinking, and highly intuitive approaches.
Managers' recognition of this is hampered by, among other things, people's
inability to agree on the nature of intuition. Both Mintzberg, and Parikh
and his co-authors, cite a wide range of confusing definitions (see panel).
But at least Parikh and co are certain of what intuition is not: instinct,
impulse, ingenuity, inspiration, intellect, intelligence or wishful
thinking.
On the basis of their broad definition of the term, they describe various
techniques for enhancing managers' innate intuition, and applying it in
practice, especially to the thought process involved in creating a corporate
'vision'. By comparison, they give only sketchy advice on how intuition can
be applied in everyday practice. They also fail to deal adequately with the
question of how managers can distinguish informed intuition from ignorant
'gut feel'.
More than half the 1,300 senior and top managers covered by the survey
claimed to use intuition and logic or reasoning in roughly equal measure.
But this was not borne out by the objective evidence which the survey
gathered through a complex questionnaire. More accurately, a large minority
of 40 per cent said they used logic and reasoning more than intuition.
The survey showed that age makes little difference to a manager's intuitive
ability. But the 45 to 59-year-olds were rated slightly higher than others.
On the other hand, top managers scored less well in objective tests than
their senior colleagues, but thought themselves superior.

FT  08 JUN 94 / Management: A boss's life at the sharp end / A look at
Gillette's controversial decision to close its Seville factory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Every day Alberto Morales goes to his office at a factory near Seville and
stays inside until it is time to go home. He no longer visits the shopfloor,
even though he is the boss - or rather, because he is the boss.
Two bodyguards, ordered by Morales' US superiors, wait outside to accompany
him off the premises. His house is under 24-hour guard.
Life for the general manager of Gillette's Spanish manufacturing subsidiary
has been like this since the morning of March 18 when he told the works
council the company had decided to close the factory.
Gillette is abandoning the Seville facility, employing about 250 people in
the industrial zone of Alcala de Guadaira, in order to concentrate European
razor-blade production at Isleworth, west of London, and Berlin. The
announcement - recalling the row early last year over Hoover's plans to move
vacuum-cleaner production from eastern France to Scotland - has provoked
bitter protests.
The Andalucia regional government contested the legality of the move. The
Spanish industry ministry described it as 'a provocation'. And one senior
labour ministry official floated the idea of a Gillette boycott.
Spain's labour laws allow for collective redundancies on certain specified
grounds, but Gillette's move did not seem to correspond to any of them.
Recently approved reforms, designed to make the rules more flexible, will
allow authorised cutbacks for reasons of reorganising production. Senior
government officials insist that this is intended to cover reorganisation
within Spain, not cross-border transfers.
The Seville closure is part of a 'realignment' announced by the Boston-based
consumer products group in January, affecting 2,000 of its 34,000 employees
worldwide. The lost jobs, mostly outside the US, are expected to be replaced
by jobs elsewhere, including China, Russia and Poland, where Gillette has
new ventures.
Gillette does not justify the Seville decision on grounds of new technology
or economic problems: 'The reason for closure is not that it is
unprofitable,' says Morales, 'but that it is superfluous.'
The plant, which enabled Gillette to exploit what was then a highly
protected Spanish market, still makes the old-fashioned double-edge blades,
the only Gillette plant in Europe still to do so. It has two other lines,
the twin-blade disposable razor known in Europe as Blue II and in the US as
Good News, and the GII, the original twin-blade fixed razor head.
Morales, an engineer who joined the plant 20 years ago, was called to London
to receive advance notice of the plan for Seville. 'It was a surprise,' he
says. 'I always knew the factory would end up being closed, but I thought it
would happen little by little. In two or three years the factory would have
died by itself.'
Instead he now finds himself in the firing line. 'I live in this office,'
Morales says glumly. He has not even tried venturing into the main part of
the factory, where production has been going on as normal. 'It is better to
maintain calm,' he reckons.
He says he has been the target of personal attacks from employees but does
not want to go into details. This is, after all, the place he has spent his
whole career, with the exception of two years at Gillette headquarters in
Boston.
Morales 'had to accept' the US management's decision to dispense with the
Spanish operation. Having accepted the role of executioner, he is not
optimistic that Gillette will provide a suitable alternative post when it is
over. 'I know they could only offer me somewhere like India,' he says,
evidently not keen on the idea. 'In Europe I don't fit. I am a factory
manager, and there are two factories in Europe.'
Morales says Gillette concentrated its modernisation effort in the UK and
Germany because of government support. 'Here we have not had any government
subsidy,' he says. Improved production methods have left Isleworth and
Berlin with excess capacity.
Gillette has already reduced its Seville workforce by about 60 per cent
since the mid-1980s, getting rid of activities in the group's perfume and
writing-instrument divisions.
To avoid lengthy administrative procedures, Spanish companies tend to offer
the maximum redundancy compensation of 45 days' pay per year's work.
Gillette's standard package has added to this an extra Pta1m for every five
years' seniority. Morales hints it may pay even more this time to achieve a
negotiated settlement.
It took more than two months of confrontation before the works council
agreed to hear the company's preliminary offer (on May 25). The open-ended
proposal includes a retirement plan, outplacement services and a range of
insurance policies.
Like a ship's captain, Morales will be the last to leave. He will stay on
until next year to liquidate the company. Then, at 54 and after six years as
general manager, he expects to be out on the street.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The appointment of Ann Taylor to head the competition division at Oftel, the
telecoms regulator, is the latest in a series of senior female appointments
to the body charged with overseeing the industry.
Taylor succeeds Anna Walker, who was last month appointed to succeed Bill
Wigglesworth as deputy to Don Cruickshank, the director-general. Her
appointment gives women a 5-4 majority on Oftel's senior management team,
with one post vacant.
Taylor moves on secondment from the DTI, where she is a grade 5 responsible
for regional policy.
The competition brief is one of the toughest at Oftel, with 40 new entrants
to the UK's liberalised telecoms industry calling loudly for better terms
for connection to BT's network. Mercury, BT's main competitor, is currently
in the courts claiming that Oftel has failed to give it a fair deal.

FT  08 JUN 94 / Recruitment: Peer pressure for jobs in the City - Proving
that it is not only the Names who are suffering from the continuing fall-out
at Lloyd's
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There he was, a fully fledged peer of the realm, monogramed cufflinks,
tortoise-shell spectacles, navy tie with pink spots, sitting behind a desk
in an outplacement centre looking for a job.
Rather like finding the Queen Mother in Ladbroke's, it just didn't seem
right that a paid up member of the aristocracy should be reduced to the
ranks of the unemployed.
Lord Strathalmond thought differently. Out of a job at the RW Sturge
Syndicate in Lloyd's, he is undergoing an outplacement course tailored to
executives at KPMG Career Consultancy Services.
He is better off than most. Financially, the wolf is still some way from the
door. He has a network of old friends and contacts that should, in theory,
be able to provide a safety net of sorts. But Strathalmond is reluctant to
rely on the old school tie.
He was managing director of the members agency at Sturge before it was
reorganised in line with Lloyd's recommendations for members to have greater
independence from their managing agents, something which Strathalmond
himself supported.
Now, at the age of 46, he has found himself for the first time in his life
standing back and taking a long hard look at his future. The experience, he
admits, is not free from fear or worry. But he is far from downhearted. 'I
have always believed that change is the best sort of challenge,' he says.
The outplacement was included as an optional part of his severance package.
It gives him the use of an office and secretary and access to training
sessions and techniques aimed at improving his chances of finding
employment.
As a qualified chartered accountant, Strathalmond should not find
opportunities wanting, but he is concerned to find the right kind of job and
has set himself a nine-month target to find a suitable position. What this
may be is not yet clear but he says he is seeking a job that will best
utilise his skills.
'I want something to which I can add value. I know that when it feels right
I will be able to tell.'
Strathalmond's position demonstrates that unemployment is no longer the
preserve of the unskilled or unqualified. He is, however, obtaining the kind
of help with job search not normally provided for the laid-off production
worker.
The executive programme at KPMG provides private offices and secretaries on
a separate floor of the consultancy. The idea is to provide a more
sophisticated outplacement service, partly to sooth the bruised pride of
losing a top job, and partly in recognition that the shock of losing the
trappings of position can often be as severe as that of losing the job
itself.
Other job-seeking managers and staff work in an open plan office environment
where all have access to telephones, a research department and various
classes, such as programmes on telephone technique or negotiating skills.
One obvious benefit of this arrangement is that all also have access to each
other to share their experiences.
One of the most striking impressions of outplacement is that it helps
restore morale and gives people time to think about their future careers.
Roger Shipton, a consultancy partner, said: 'Getting another job is not as
difficult as some people suggest but it is critical that people take the
time to assess what they particularly want to do. That way they are more
likely to find the right job.'
Opting for change
Worried about your executive share options? There is nothing to fear,
according to a new survey which shows they are alive and kicking in spite of
shareholder criticisms of executives cashing in on huge share price
multiples that tended to flatter their individual performance record.
There is evidence that some companies are dithering about what scheme to
offer next after the institutional backlash last year that led the two big
institutional bodies, the National Association of Pension Funds and the
Association of British Insurers, to lay down criteria for performance
conditions on the exercise of options.
The vast majority of those renewing schemes, however, are now including
performance conditions. An analysis of shareholder documents issued since
mid-July and the end of May found that 39 of the top 350 UK-listed companies
have asked shareholders to renew their 10-year-old schemes.
Only three of the companies said they were not imposing performance
conditions on the options.
Surprisingly 11 companies asked for and obtained approvals from shareholders
for unspecific schemes although the boards gave assurances that they would
include conditions.
New Bridge Consultants, which carried out the survey, ventured that most of
these were probably waiting to see what other companies were doing before
committing themselves.
Of the 25 companies which have stated their condition, most - 64 per cent of
them - have chosen Earnings Per Share as a performance measure. Some 16 per
cent of the companies are using share price and 20 per cent have opted for
the concept of total shareholder return (growth in share price plus
dividends).
The study also looked at the targets chosen by companies and although the
information was unclear in 13 per cent of companies using EPS, the vast
majority - 87 per cent - are measuring its growth against the Retail Prices
Index.
Of those companies, 71 per cent use a formula of RPI plus 2 per cent per
annum over a three-year period. Among them are Coats Viyella, Forte and
Cadbury Schweppes.
Companies using share price or total shareholder return measure against
various indicators. The most popular is one of the main FT indexes (45 per
cent), used by Inchcape, Tarmac and Guinness among others. Of the rest, 11
per cent compare performance against a sector, 11 per cent against RPI and
22 per cent against a mixture of an FT Index and RPI.
David Tankel, New Bridge Street Consultants director, said: 'It may surprise
some people that earnings per share has come top of the heap. A lot of
people have been expecting other measures to take over but it is not dead
yet.' Information about the report can be obtained from the consultancy, tel
071 236 1086.
For motivation
A comment that emerged time and again among veterans at the D-Day
commemorations was that 'We felt we were doing something worthwhile.'
Imagine if it were possible to replicate in peacetime the human effort and
ingenuity arising out of necessity in wartime. Unfortunately too few
managements today appear to consider motivation beyond different pay
arrangements.
A survey carried out by the MSF technical union among employees of insurance
companies found that less than a sixth of them believed that their
managements motivated them to perform well.
Only 18 per cent thought their performance assessment system was fair and
fewer still - 15 per cent - thought promotion was carried out fairly and
three-quarters of them thought training was inadequate. Only 21 per cent
believed their company treated employees with respect, while only 18.2 per
cent considered that management information could be trusted.
If this is reflected in other sectors it is perhaps understandable why the
veterans remember not just those who died but their achievements with pride.
There is little to match their endeavours today.

FT  08 JUN 94 / Business and the Environment: Eco-index charts corporate
efforts - Hilary Barnes examines the growth of in-house environmental
reports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Novo Nordisk, the Danish health care and industrial enzymes group, has
developed a new tool for use in corporate environmental analysis, an
environmental performance indicator or 'eco-productivity index'. It was
included in the group's first corporate environmental report, a detailed
42-page production published recently.
'The index enables us to make precise environmental comparisons from year to
year,' says Steen Riisgaard, a Novo Nordisk director. It also enables the
group to set measurable goals for improvements in performance.
Riisgaard heads the group's bio-industrial division, which operates the
fermentation facilities for the production of enzymes and the health care
division's insulin and human growth hormones. These facilities produce most
of the group's waste.
The concept of the index was welcomed by John Elkington, partner in the UK
environmental consultancy SustainAbility, which last year published Coming
Clean, a survey of corporate environmental reporting.
Elkington and his colleagues have provided a verification of Novo Nordisk's
report as 'a fair and honest reflection' of the company's policies. He gave
the report high marks in comparison with reports by other companies. He
described the index as 'very useful' and hoped other companies would adopt
the idea.
The index is derived by dividing the volume of output sold by the volume of
inputs, such as water, energy, raw materials and packaging. The index rises
if the company is successful in producing more per unit of input.
Taking 1990 as the base year (=100), the index shows an improvement on the
raw materials side of 19 per cent, for water of 31 per cent, for energy of
33 per cent and for packaging of 19 per cent. The group has set specific
targets for annual improvements in each of the indexes of 4 or 5 per cent a
year.
The Danish group claims to be the world's biggest producer of insulin, used
to treat diabetes, and industrial enzymes, which have a wide variety of
applications - in detergents, for breaking down starch into sugar,
extracting juice from grapes and giving jeans a stone-washed look without
using pumice stones.
The group uses 214,000 tonnes of raw materials, 3.4m gigajoules of energy,
4m cubic meters of water, 7,700 tonnes of packaging materials and
distributes 61,300 tonnes of products. The eco-productivity index is only
one aspect of the group's efforts to achieve 'sustainable production'.
A second crucial factor is the achievement in recycling waste products.
About 40 per cent of the water used at Novo Nordisk's main production
facility in Kalundborg, Denmark, is recycled, mainly by selling it to
farmers with sludge from the fermentation tanks.
However, before the water reaches Novo it has already been used for cooling
in an oil refinery, which passes it on as process steam to a local power
utility. Only then does it arrive at Novo Nordisk - an example of industrial
symbiosis, which economises on water resources from a nearby lake.
Some 43 per cent of liquid waste was recycled in 1993, either as sludge for
fertilising fields or as pigfood (inputs for fermentation include soya meal,
sugar and maize flour) compared with 25 per cent in 1990.
It was with mixed feelings that Novo Nordisk undertook to provide a
corporate environment report, says Mads Ovlisen, group chief executive. The
group has a long history of seeking to be a good global citizen on
environmental questions; and the fact that Novo Nordisk is based in a
country where environmental consciousness is well developed and
environmental legislation is rigorous, has stimulated the group's interest
in the issue.
But, says Ovlisen, a detailed environmental report also provides information
of use to competitors, prompting internal opposition to the report plan.

FT  08 JUN 94 / Business and the Environment: Rich seams in a Wild West war
 -Plans to revise an 1872 law on mineral excavation rights are fuelling a
row between the US mining industry and the green lobby
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A battle is raging in the US Congress over legislation which could determine
the future of the country's mining industry. At the heart of the debate is a
law which allows miners to gain title to public lands for a nominal fee: a
maximum of Dollars 5 (Pounds 3.30) per acre. Under the law anyone, from
individuals to international conglomerates, is guaranteed the right to
excavate, as long as proof of substantial hardrock mineral deposits is
furnished.
Mining industry proponents believe the sector should continue to receive
breaks in the interest of maintaining and creating jobs. 'What's at stake
here is nothing less than the survival of mining in this country,' says Jack
Gerard, representative for the Mineral Resource Alliance, an industry
organisation. 'If we make mining too expensive, we will drive the sector
overseas.'
Environmentalists, however, accuse the industry of hitching a free ride on
the back of taxpayers and wreaking ecological havoc. They want a revision of
the law which will demand compensation for use of the land and enforce
tougher environmental regulations.
At least some modification to the law is expected by early next year. Two
versions are currently being floated in Congress. The Senate bill, favoured
by the mining industry, would impose royalties of 2 per cent on minerals
extracted. The House bill, favoured by environmentalists, would impose
royalties of 8 per cent and impose stricter ecological standards.
The law which has environmentalists on the warpath was created in 1872, when
the US was a very different country. The federal government wanted to speed
up settlement of the Wild West and created the mining law to encourage
prospectors to try their luck on the great frontier. Visions of how western
lands should be managed in modern America, however, diverge dramatically
between environmentalists and the mining industry.
Environmentalists see corporations ravaging the land without paying the
government just compensation. 'Pollution from a copper mining site in Butte,
Montana, extends 100 miles downstream in the Clark Fork river,' says Philip
Hocker, president of the Mineral Policy Centre, an environmentalist group in
Washington DC.
'The mining company left the tailings sitting there and every time the river
rises, it kills off fish,' Hocker says. 'Or take Summitville, Colorado,
where the mining company Galactic Resources poisoned 17 miles of river. It
went bankrupt and US taxpayers had to pick up a Dollars 100m clean-up bill.'
Proponents of the law, however, see entire communities being revived by
mining activity. 'In Challis, Idaho, a molybdenum mine has just opened up
again, and turned what was a modern day ghost town into a thriving
community,' says Idaho's Senator Larry Craig, who has sponsored the 2 per
cent royalty bill. 'The new school will open this fall, houses that sat idle
for years are being sold, and the mine has created about 350 to 500 new
jobs.'
The storm over the mining law is part of a wider debate over the use of some
500m acres of land owned by the federal government in the western part of
the country. The Clinton administration has launched several attacks on
commercial use of public land since it came into power, including attempts
to raise grazing fees for livestock and the blockage of lumber extraction.
The president's approach on the public lands issue has met with mixed
success. Industry is outraged over attempts to prevent the use of public
land, while environmentalists are furious that the administration has not
gone further to protect the areas.
The Clinton administration's first attempt to throw out the mining law
failed. Interior Secretary Bruce Babbit had tried to prevent Canadian-based
Barrick Goldstrike Mines from gaining title to 1,800 acres of public lands
containing about Dollars 10bn in gold deposits in Nevada. On May 16, a
federal judge, citing the mining law, ordered the secretary to hand over the
title.
'This is the biggest gold heist since the days of Butch Cassidy,' says
Babbit of the court rule. 'But these folks stole it fair and square.'
Environmentalists are particularly concerned about damage to water sources.
Substances like mercury, which can poison fish supplies, are often used to
extract the metals. Toxic acid mine drainage, triggered by the exposure of
ores to air, can also cause severe problems, especially if it reaches the
ground water. Ecologists also complain about the air pollution created by
smelters and the surface devastation mining can cause.
Mining proponents say ecologists are hitting the industry at a time when it
has already been weakened by slack metals prices. 'At a time of low world
prices, the mining sector cannot afford onerous royalties,' says Linda
Findlay, director of government relations for the copper mining group Phelps
Dodge. 'We need to go where it's most advantageous to mine, and if it gets
too costly in the US, we'll move our business overseas.'
Other supporters of mining on public lands cite the need for metals and
minerals supplies for national security reasons. 'We cannot afford to be
entirely dependent on other countries for our mineral supplies,' says
Senator Craig.
The mining industry's trump card, however, is jobs. The 8 per cent royalties
which would be imposed by the House bill would cost between 35,000 and
45,000 jobs in the sector, say proponents of the 1872 law, and more jobs
would be shed in support sectors. Environmentalists claim these figures are
bloated, but there is no question that the jobs issue has garnered much
support for public land mining from western state representatives and
senators. 'The 8 per cent royalty bill is a
save-the-environment-to-heck-with-the-jobs approach,' says Craig.
The Congressional battle which will ensue over the next few months is
expected to be fierce. Royalties are only part of the debate. The House bill
would give the federal government the right to block mining entirely, if
activities cause more than 'minimal disturbance to the environment'. Mining
companies are also nervous about tougher reclamation standards and the
bill's insistance that cutting-edge technology be used whenever possible to
minimise ecological damage.
Although industry is solidly opposed to the House bill, it may emerge
victorious. Public opinion has been rallying behind the revision. 'Our
strategy is to try to create public indignation over the issue,' says
Kathryn Hohmann, director of public lands of the Sierra Club, an
environmentalist group. 'We're trying to get the message out that these
people are tearing up public lands, and they're doing it for free.'
The mining industry believes it has been the victim of misinformation. 'The
propaganda doesn't take into account that a lot of public lands are already
protected through the national park system,' says Jack Knebel, president of
the American Mining Congress. 'This is not about mining Yellowstone.'
However, Knebel concedes that the sector may be losing on the public
relations front. 'It will be an uphill battle for us as far as public
opinion goes,' he says.
That the 1872 law will stand as it is seems doubtful. Mining companies will
almost certainly be forced to pay something for the use of public lands in
the future. What is uncertain is how high royalties will be and whether
tougher environmental standards will be enforced.

FT  08 JUN 94 / Perkins clinches Pounds 660m deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FG Wilson Engineering, the Northern Ireland manufacturer of diesel
electrical generating sets, has signed an agreement worth more than Pounds
660m to buy diesel engines from Perkins for the next 10 years, it was
announced yesterday.
The deal is one of a series of long-term contracts which Perkins has signed
with big customers. They include Caterpillar, the construction equipment
group, Volvo Penta, the marine engine company, Hanomag, the plant
manufacturer, and most recently Massey Ferguson, the tractor maker.
The new agreement makes Wilson, Europe's largest generating set
manufacturer, one of the biggest of Perkins's 600 customers. The engines
will power 80 per cent to 90 per cent of Wilson's generating sets, of which
it produces 17,000 a year.
Mr Tom Wilson, managing director of the privately owned company, said the
agreement was 'a consolidation of several strands of deals which existed in
the past'. It embraces joint product development, the scheduling of sales
and 'just-in-time' delivery.
By signing a long-term contract, Wilson and Perkins are following a trend
most clearly seen in the automotive and aerospace sectors where makers have
been seeking stability and co-operation with a smaller number of suppliers.
About 90 per cent of Wilson's output, all manufactured in Northern Ireland,
is exported. In the year to last August, it had sales of Pounds 141m and
made after-tax profits of Pounds 13m. Its biggest single market is China.
Perkins will manufacture the engines at its Peterborough and Shrewsbury
plants and ship them to Wilson's expanding factory at Larne.
Wilson has more than 900 employees in Northern Ireland, making it one of the
largest engineering groups in the province.

FT  08 JUN 94 / Plans to alter APR formula are attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Office of Fair Trading's proposal to change the way in which annual
percentage rates are calculated is one of the most controversial aspects of
yesterday's report on the Consumer Credit Act.
The Consumers' Association said yesterday that the changes would 'weaken
consumer protection and confuse consumers.'
The OFT recommended that APRs on credit and store cards should be based only
on the interest-charge element of the total charge for credit, with
'separate and bold' disclosure of fees and any other fixed charges.
This change, which would require an amendment to the European Union
directive on APRs, would help consumers understand the marginal cost of
using one existing credit facility over another, said the OFT.
The Consumers' Association said that the proposal 'flies in the face of the
whole purpose of the APR' since it would prevent the APR from being the
benchmark for comparison of all types of credit.
As an interim measure to improve the consistency of APRs, the OFT said
calculations of APRs for advertising purposes should be based on an
outstanding credit card balance of Pounds 500 - close to the average balance
on credit cards - rather than the current Pounds 1,000.
The OFT also recommended that mortgage lenders quote separate APR figures
for the initial period of a fixed or discounted rate mortgage and for the
period after it has ended. Lenders often use the initial rate as the basis
for quoting the APR on the entire life of the loan.
This was criticised by the Consumers' Association as adding to confusion.
The Council of Mortgage Lenders said it would improve the unsatisfactory
position, although it doubted whether the APR was sufficiently understood to
make it a useful contributor to consumer protection.
Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, said the concern that
consumers had little understanding of APRs was 'unnecessarily negative'.
Research commissioned by the OFT into consumers' understanding of APRs found
that fewer than half those questioned correctly identified its meaning and
30 per cent said they had considered the APR when looking for credit and
loan arrangements.

FT  08 JUN 94 / OFT gives the individual top priority: Report calls for
deregulation of business lending - Homebuyers would be given fuller details
of mortgage packages / Reactions to the proposals to change consumer credit
rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's report by the Office of Fair Trading on the Consumer Credit Act
contains a range of measures aimed both at reducing the burden of regulation
on business and, in certain cases, at providing extra protection for
consumers.
The main recommendations it makes are:
All business lending and hiring should be removed from regulation under the
act. 'The real point of this legislation is to protect individuals, not
business people,' said Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading.
The office believes that the present scope of the act, which includes all
unincorporated businesses, is anomalous since it includes large businesses
such as accountancy and law practices, while many small businesses are
excluded.
This move was welcomed by the Federation of Small Businesses, which
represents businesses employing less than 20 people. The federation said:
'Businesses should be well able to look after themselves on a caveat emptor
basis, whether they are small traders or incorporated companies.
'The removal of excessive regulation should release more funds into the
small business sector.'
The Finance and Leasing Association, a trade body for providers of credit
and hire facilities, also welcomed the recommendation, which it said would
lessen the regulatory burden on small businesses. 'We were afraid that if
the act was extended then small businesses would find their access to medium
term finance severely curtailed.'
Mortgage lenders should be required to give more information about mortgage
'packages', in which loans are marketed together with connected services
such as life or general insurance.
The office said there was need for greater 'transparency and choice' for
borrowers. It published research yesterday which showed that about half the
consumers surveyed had taken mortgages that were conditional on the
acceptance of services provided by the lender or intermediary, whether or
not they had initially looked for a package.
Only 25 per cent of these respondents had received any information on the
cost of tied services and 15 per cent were sufficiently dissatisfied to try
to change the provider of the connected service.
The office recommended that the relevant section of the Courts and Legal
Services Act 1990 concerning 'tying-in' be implemented immediately. This
would require lenders to give prospective borrowers separate information on
the price of connected services.
Sir Bryan acknowledged that this would only affect mortgages arranged
directly with lenders, which account for about half of the market.
Nonetheless, he said he would 'expect to see greater competition in
insurance products related to home purchase as a result of this change'.
The office's proposals were given a guarded welcome by the Consumers'
Association on the grounds that it would provide consumers with some
additional information.
However, it warned that a solution that covered only half the market could
not be adequate in the long term.
The Council of Mortgage Lenders said it was disappointed at the office's
recommendation. 'Given the popularity of mortgage packages and the fierce
competition for mortgage business, this step seems unnecessary and unlikely
to enhance consumer choice,' it said.
Regulations relating to credit and hire quotations should be revoked. The
office said that the present rules were of little effect because written
quotations were rarely requested by consumers.
Rules for credit and hire advertisements should be simplified. The
regulations now called for 'a lot of small print that does not convey
information effectively'. The rules also tended to focus rules on issues of
compliance, rather than on conveying a fair and reasonable picture.
Calculations of early-settlement rebates should be made more equitable to
borrowers. The office recommended clearer disclosure of penalties, changes
to the formula for calculating early settlements and a ceiling of Pounds 100
on the early-settlement fee charged by lenders.
The upper limit for a regulated credit or hire agreement should be increased
from Pounds 15,000 to Pounds 25,000 to reflect inflation since 1974.
The lower limit for liability under the act should be increased to Pounds
150. Lenders should not be required to display an APR for small loans since
the office considered it was of little relevance to consumers taking out
small loans.
The powers of exemption under the act should be widened to deal with
specific products where compliance was extremely difficult.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Cutting the burden on business
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
The OFT report's main recommendations are ....
  to remove all business lending and hiring from regulation under the
Consumer Credit Act
  to revoke regulations relating to credit and hire quotations
  to simplify rules for credit and hire advertisements
  to change the way APRs are calculated or disclosed to improve their
value for comparing credit terms
  to make early settlement rebates more equitable to borrowers
  to widen the powers of exemption under the Act to deal with specific
products where compliance was extremely difficult.
  to implement section 104 of the Courts and Legal Services Act to give
borrowers more information about mortgage packages
  to increase the upper limit for a regulated credit or hire agreement
from Pounds15000 to Pounds25000.
  to increase the lower limit for liability under the act to
Pounds150.

FT  08 JUN 94 / Two buy-out teams considering coal bids
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two management buy-out teams announced yesterday they were considering plans
to bid for parts of British Coal. Their announcement came as the government
disclosed that 25 companies had qualified to bid for the five UK regions on
offer.
Mr Bob Siddall, director of opencast operations, and Mr David Brewer, head
of finance, said their company, English Coal, had qualified to bid for the
three regions incorporating England and north Wales.
Mr Alan Houghton, director of the central north region comprising the
Yorkshire pits, is heading Northern Coal, a company which has qualified to
bid for the region he runs.
A third buy-out team is expected to announce its plans today. Mr Bryan
Riddleston, regional director for the South Wales opencast region, is
thought to be leading a potential bid for his area.
National Power and PowerGen, the main electricity generators, are thought to
be among the other 22 companies which have qualified. Analysts believe it is
extremely unlikely they will make a bid, but that they want to look at the
businesses of future suppliers.
Both companies are thought to have paid the Pounds 75,000 necessary to
qualify in all five coal regions.
Mr Keith Palmer, managing director of NM Rothschild, the merchant bank
advising the government on privatisation, would not say yesterday which
companies had qualified to bid.
However he said that of the 33 which had applied, 25 had qualified to bid
for one or more of the regions. Several others among the 33 had qualified
for one or more of the six stand-alone mines. A small, unspecified number of
the 33 had failed to meet technical or financial criteria, Mr Palmer said.
The qualifying companies were yesterday sent information covering the areas
or pits in which they are interested.
The companies will have access to the areas or pits in which they are
interested and a data room, and will be able to visit British Coal sites.
Bids are due in mid September. English Coal, which is advised by Coopers &amp;
Lybrand, the consultancy firm, said it had qualified as a prospective bidder
for five of the six stand-alone pits: Goldthorpe, Thorne, Annesley/Bentinck,
Ellington and Kiveton.
English Coal and Northern Coal said employees and management would be given
the chance to participate in the ownership and profits of their businesses
if the bids succeeded.

FT  08 JUN 94 / ICI chief warns banks against short-termism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pressure from shareholders could hamper banks' efforts to build supportive
long-term relationships with large companies, Sir Denys Henderson, chairman
of Imperial Chemical Industries, warned yesterday.
Speaking in London at the International Monetary Conference, a meeting of
senior executives from 103 large banks, Sir Denys said that banks should
take a 'long-term supportive' stance towards customers.
'I suspect that the pressure on under-performing banks to improve their
shareholder value will grow, which may make even the most tolerant more
critical of clients' performance than in the past,' Sir Denys said.
He added that a long-term supportive stance 'through fair and foul weather
alike' was the normal model in Asia-Pacific, particularly in Japan.
Germany's practice was also close to that of Japan but the tendency was less
prevalent elsewhere.
Sir Denys criticised some banks for being more interested in 'peddling the
deal of the day' rather than preserving objectivity in the advice they
offered to companies on how to improve performance.
He said that while other industries wanted stability to make long-term
investment plans, 'some parts of the banking industry welcome volatility,
which generates excitement and the prospect of large instant gains'. Sir
Denys said that ICI remained 'keenly interested in receiving innovative
advice which will improve our financial performance' but that advisers
should strike a balance between objectivity and keenness to do business.
In a separate discussion on financial centres, Lord Alexander, chairman of
National Westminster Bank, said that London would depend on its 'continuing
capacity to innovate' and form the hub of a global network.
He said there would 'always be the need for a leading centre in the European
time zone, but Madrid, Amsterdam, Paris and Frankfurt all have their own
aspirations' and London's position would be challenged.
Baron Alexandre Lamfalussy, president of the European Monetary Institute,
based in Frankfurt, said the European Monetary Union needed to be based in a
sophisticated financial centre to perform its future role as a monetary
authority.
IMC members, who meet in a financial centre once a year to discuss matters
affecting the international banking industry, were received last night at
Buckingham Palace by the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh.

FT  08 JUN 94 / Deep-sea find spotlights Cinderellas of shipping
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government came under pressure yesterday to reopen the public inquiry
into the loss of the bulk carrier Derbyshire following the discovery of
wreckage in the area where it went down.
The 189,000-tonne vessel became the largest British vessel to be lost at sea
when it sank in a typhoon off Japan in 1980 with the loss of all of its 44
crew.
Parts of a wreck have been found nearly three miles down by a survey vessel
chartered by the International Transport Workers' Federation.
Mr Jimmy Knapp, general secretary of the RMT transport union, called
yesterday for the government to hold a public inquiry and to fund the
continued search for wreckage. 'We have argued for over 13 years that our
members perished because their ship sank as a result of the vessel having
inherent structural design faults,' he said.
The transport department said it would consider any new evidence.
A public inquiry held in 1987-1988 found that the vessel had probably been
overwhelmed by the forces of nature, and that the possibility of structural
weakness was low. Families of the crew and marine experts were dissatisfied
with these findings.
The Derbyshire may have been the largest vessel of its type to sink but it
was not the only one. Dry bulk carriers have a poor safety record - at least
64 were lost between 1991 and 1993. A survey by the International
Association of Dry Cargo Shipowners published in February found that human
error was the most common cause of vessels going down.
Dry bulk carriers are the workhorses of the marine world with more than
5,000 in service carrying cargoes such as coal and ores.
They frequently receive rough treatment in harbour with heavy cargoes being
dropped into their holds and pneumatic hammers being used to clean hold
sides.
'They are the Cinderellas of the shipping industry,' said Mr Chris Horrocks,
secretary general of the International Chamber of Shipping.
'They do not carry passengers. Unlike tankers they have no major pollution
potential. It is a question of being out of sight, out of mind.'

FT  08 JUN 94 / Polly Peck assets set for early sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Administrators to Polly Peck International, the collapsed conglomerate
formerly controlled by Mr Asil Nadir, expect to sell its main remaining
assets in the next year.
Mr Chris Barlow, of accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand, who has taken over as a
joint administrator from Mr Michael Jordan, said yesterday the group's
holdings in electronics groups Vestel and Sansui were likely to be sold in
the next few months.
Preliminary estimates suggest that proceeds from all the remaining assets
may raise more than Dollars 100m (Pounds 67m).
Mr Barlow was speaking as a copy of the latest six-monthly report on Polly
Peck's administration was circulated to the group's creditors.
It says a draft statement of claim is being finalised for a potential legal
action against Stoy Hayward, Polly Peck's principal auditors, and approval
to begin proceedings will shortly be sought from a sub-committee of
creditors.
It sticks to its previous estimates that creditors will ultimately receive a
dividend of 3.7p to 12.5p in the pound, and that there is 'no likelihood' of
any payments to shareholders.
Unsecured creditors will receive proceeds through an entity called Arvi,
which has claimed assets owned by Polly Peck's Dutch holding company,
Holdings BV. Arvi will receive between 27 per cent and 39 per cent of the
assets, depending on the outcome of possible litigation with two other
claimants, Finance and Finance NV, which owe certain creditors.
Polly Peck International receipts since it entered administration in October
1990 were Pounds 101.8m at May 24 this year. Payments were Pounds 100.1m -
of which Pounds 33.7m went to the administrators and other professionals.

FT  08 JUN 94 / Irishman wins race abuse case
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A 36-year-old man from Northern Ireland has been awarded Pounds 5,902 by an
industrial tribunal in Nottingham for suffering racial abuse at work. The
case may have an important impact on how British employers treat their Irish
employees.
Mr Trevor McAuley was the subject of repeated anti-Irish remarks by some of
his workmates. He was often called a 'typical thick Paddy' and was the
subject of derogatory remarks 'about the Irish almost every day'.
The tribunal agreed unanimously that he had suffered 'stress and
humiliation'.
'This is the first time such issues have been put before an industrial
tribunal,' said Mr Herman Ouseley, chairman of the Commission for Racial
Equality.
'We know from regular complaints made to us that Irish people suffer abuse
day after day. We hope that they will be able to use this result to secure a
change in attitude on the part of their employers.'
Mr McAuley did not receive the current maximum award for race discrimination
of Pounds 12,000. His award was made up of Pounds 3,402.50 for loss and
compensation and a further Pounds 2,500 for injury to his feelings. From
July 4, the maximum financial limit on awards in race discrimination cases
is to be raised.
Mr McAuley was a machinist in a small family business - Auto Alloys Foundry
in Blackwell, Derbyshire. He was dismissed three days before the end of his
first two years' employment at the company, which preventing him from
bringing an unfair dismissal charge.
The tribunal concluded he had been fired 'principally because he was an
Irishman who would not take Irish jokes lying down, in other words he did
not 'fit in' '.
Mr Dan Taylor, his former employer, said yesterday he did not agree with the
tribunal's verdict. 'I cannot afford commercially to appeal against it,' he
said. 'But this case is another nail in the coffin of British manufacturing.
We should not have to be dealing with matters like this but getting on with
the job.'
The industrial tribunal said Mr Taylor had 'not taken all reasonable steps'
to prevent workers from abusing Mr McAuley. But Mr Taylor said it was
unrealistic for him to tell 'rough, tough guys' in a foundry not to make
remarks that would upset Mr McAuley.
Mr McAuley, who has worked in England for 20 years, said he had been the
subject of anti-Irish abuse before in his working life but not in the
persistent form it took at the foundry.

FT  08 JUN 94 / Software sifts factual overload
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A computer company will today launch a product that would have been the
answer to a schoolchild's prayer in the days when grammar was taught
seriously - software that can parse an English sentence.
Oracle, the US software company, has developed ConText, which it claims can
deal with the growing information overload by analysing the content and
meaning of the English text it reads.
Oracle points out that by 1982, scientific and corporate technical
information was doubling every five years. By 1992 this figure was 1.6
years, and between 70 per cent and 90 per cent of the information is stored
in unstructured text format.
The software has a 600,000 word dictionary and up to 1,000 pieces of
linguistic data available on each word, Oracle said. It can identify the
strongest overall themes in a document and automatically produce summaries.
Mr Jerry Held of Oracle said: 'Think of ConText as an electronic assistant
able to automatically wade through mountains of textual data, ranging from
electronic mail and the daily newspaper to voluminous legal contracts or an

FT  08 JUN 94 / Assets of Polly Peck face early sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Administrators to Polly Peck International, the collapsed conglomerate
formerly controlled by Mr Asil Nadir, expect to sell its main remaining
assets in the next year.
Mr Chris Barlow of accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand, who has taken over as a
joint administrator from Mr Michael Jordan, said yesterday the group's
holdings in electronics groups Vestel and Sansui were likely to be sold in
the next few months.
Advisers have been retained to assist with timing and pricing, and
preliminary estimates suggest that proceeds from all the remaining assets
may raise more than Dollars 100m (Pounds 67m).
Mr Barlow was speaking as a copy of the latest six-monthly report on Polly
Peck's administration was circulated to the group's creditors.
It says a draft statement of claim is being finalised for a potential legal
action against Stoy Hayward, Polly Peck's principal auditors, and approval
to begin proceedings will shortly be sought from a sub-committee of
creditors.
It sticks to its previous estimates that creditors will ultimately receive a
dividend of 3.7p to 12.5p in the pound, and that there is 'no likelihood' of
any payments to shareholders.
Unsecured creditors will receive proceeds through an entity called Arvi,
which has claimed assets owned by Polly Peck's Dutch holding company,
Holdings BV. Arvi will receive between 27 per cent and 39 per cent of the
assets.
The range depends on the outcome of possible litigation with two other
claimants, Finance and Finance NV, which owe certain creditors money. Arvi
will also receive between 15 per cent and 20 per cent of the claims against
Finance NV. The total range of claims against Holdings from Arvi, Finance
and Finance NV is Pounds 570m to Pounds 681m, while total claims from all
creditors are between Pounds 1.4bn and Pounds 1.6bn.
Total Polly Peck International receipts since it entered administration in
October 1990 were Pounds 101.8m at May 24 this year. Payments were Pounds
100.1m - of which Pounds 33.7m went to the administrators and other
professionals.
The administrators are shortly to lodge defences against indictments brought
against them by the Istanbul public prosecutor's office.
In the past few months they have obtained injunctions to prevent Mr Nadir
gaining control of the Crystal Cove hotel in northern Cyprus. He continues
to control Jasmine Beach Hotel and Unipac, which the administrators say
belong to Polly Peck.

FT  08 JUN 94 / Malaysia warned of retaliation risk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KUALA LUMPUR
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Calls for retaliation against Malaysia are likely to increase unless Kuala
Lumpur moves to lift a ban on giving public sector contracts to British
companies, Mr Richard Needham, the trade minister, said yesterday.
Mr Needham said at the end of his second visit to Malaysia in a fortnight
that a lifting of the ban was likely within the next six weeks.
'They've said in principle they are going to take it off. But the longer
they leave it the more likelihood there is of retaliation on the British
side and the more voices will be raised against it,' Mr Needham said.
Malaysia imposed the ban at the end of February after a report in the Sunday
Times alleged that Wimpey, the British construction company, had been
involved in negotiations to offer bribes to Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the
Malaysian prime minister.
Dr Mahathir's government had also been angered by the controversy
surrounding a British loan for the Pergau dam project.
At the time the ban was imposed, Malaysia said hundreds of millions of
pounds worth of contracts for British companies could be affected. A
UK-Japanese consortium that had been given the contract for project
management of a Pounds 3bn airport being built outside Kuala Lumpur has been
one of the main casualties of the Malaysian government's action.
Mr Needham has played a central role in trying to persuade the Malaysians to
lift the ban. Two weeks ago he proposed a Malaysian/British forum to promote
co-operation on trade, investment and technology transfer.
'We have a long relationship with Malaysia, but the better you know someone
when you have a row, the worse it will be,' said Mr Needham.
Some Malaysian exporters are concerned the ban could ricochet on their
business. Malaysia is lobbying the European Union for an extension of
trading privileges under the generalised system of preferences. Mr Needham
said Britain supported continuation of Malaysia's preference status.
The system allows Malaysia preferential tariffs on its exports. More than
15,000 Malaysian-made Proton cars are exported each year to Britain, where
they are sold for less than in Malaysia.

FT  08 JUN 94 / Beaches fail EU tests on hygiene
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bathing water at popular beaches such as Blackpool and Morecambe is still
below European hygiene standards, a European Commission report said
yesterday.
Of the 457 UK resort areas tested for pollution last year, 80 per cent
reached the levels expected by the commission.
That was one of the lowest rates in the European Union, along with
land-locked Luxembourg, which was tested on its fresh-water bathing areas.
The commission said, however, that the whole of Britain's holiday coastline
was expected to meet the cleanliness standards by the end of next year.
The EU has already arraigned the UK government at the European Court of
Justice over beaches at Blackpool. The court was assured by government
lawyers that the clean-up programme was on target for completion next year -
20 years after the bathing water directive was accepted by European
governments and 10 years after the implementation deadline.
Proposals for providing new feeding grounds for wading birds displaced by
the Cardiff Bay barrage are inadequate, the World Wide Fund for Nature said
yesterday, Roland Adburgham writes.
It said research showed the new sites would only absorb 'a tiny fraction' of
the dunlin and redshank on the Cardiff Bay mudflats.
Work on the barrage started last month. WWF has written to Brussels to say
the scheme will breach the European habitat directive. It calls on the EU
not to approve it.

FT  08 JUN 94 / Major urges his supporters to vote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major issued a last-minute plea to traditional Tory voters to oppose
a centralised federal Europe as the final stages of the European elections
campaign erupted yesterday into a row over job creation. With all three
party leaders winding up their European election campaigns at set-piece
rallies, the prime minister focused his attention on persuading traditional
Conservative supporters not to abstain tomorrow in protest at the
government's domestic record.
In an implicit acknowledgement that the government needs to muster its core
support to avoid an electoral catastrophe, Mr Major said protest votes and
abstentions would severely damage Britain's interests in Europe.
He told a rally in London that the campaign had shown 'we are the only party
prepared to fight day in and day out for Britain's best interests in
Europe'.
But Labour and the Liberal Democrats insisted the poll would be a referendum
on Mr Major's record since the 1992 general election. Mrs Margaret Beckett,
the Labour leader, said that voters would be rejecting a government which
was 'divided over Europe, riven with incompetence and incapable of telling
the truth'.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, urged voters to deliver a verdict
on a government which had 'broken its election promises and betrayed the
hopes of the people'.
The speeches came as the three main parties were embroiled in a fierce row
over the implications for Britain of a report by the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development on labour markets.
A clearly delighted Mr Major was joined by a phalanx of senior ministers in
insisting the report amounted to a ringing endorsement of the government's
emphasis on deregulated and flexible markets.
In surprisingly confident mood at last night's rally and during earlier
media interviews, Mr Major insisted that the Conservatives had won all the
main arguments during the campaign.
He spoke of his 'passionate conviction' that Britain should play a part in
shaping Europe's future and described 'this European Union of ours' as 'a
very great venture'.
But in a carefully-balanced speech he again conjured up a vision of a
flexible, multi-speed Europe with member states free to act in their own way
and at their own speed.
Flanked by Union Jacks, Mr Major was firm on defence, saying there was no
need 'for the Commission to be involved in the defence of Europe'.
Mr Major was supported by Sir Norman Fowler, the Conservative party
chairman, who cautioned against the view that the Liberal Democrats
represented 'some middle way' on Europe.
In defiant mood, Sir Norman said Liberal Democrat policies were just as
'extreme' and 'damaging' as Labour's.
Mr Major's relatively relaxed demeanour appeared to reflect confidence at
Conservative Central Office that the government will win closer to 20 seats
in the Strasbourg assembly than the five or six some have projected.
That assessment was reinforced by an ICM poll in today's Daily Express which
suggested they might win between 15 and 25 seats.

FT  08 JUN 94 / OECD fuels row on minimum pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The OECD's report on job creation saw each of the three main parties
claiming support for its own strategy. First, Mr Major was joined by
ministers saying the report endorsed their emphasis on deregulated and
flexible markets.
The prime minister said on LBC radio that it was 'a great setback for Labour
that independent experts have looked at what they wish to do and said it is
nonsense'.
He added that Labour wanted to 'interrupt markets and try to regulate them,
and the whole thrust of the report is in precisely the opposite direction'.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said the conclusions had
exposed Labour's commitment to a minimum wage as a recipe for job
destruction.
But Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, led an opposition counter-attack
based on the OECD's call for flexible markets to be balanced by greater
emphasis on education and training.
Mr John Prescott, shadow employment secretary, said the Tories had
'deliberately misrepresented' the report to hide the 'catastrophic economic
failure' of deregulation.
He said the Tories had created a 'low-skill, low-investment, low-pay
economy' which could not protect against 'the onslaught of cheap competition
from low-wage economies'.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor, said the report supported the government's
argument that job creation depends on supply-side reforms focusing on
flexible labour markets.
'These policies have helped us to get unemployment down by nearly 300,000
from its peak, while it has continued to rise elsewhere in Europe,' he said.
Labour said the report left open the option of a 'responsible' minimum wage,
even though it recommends abolition in countries which already have such
legislation. The party pointed to a passage suggesting that the 'adverse
employment effects' could be minimised by indexation of the minimum wage to
prices rather than earnings.
Mr Alan Beith, Liberal Democrat treasury spokesman, said the report was 'a
direct criticism of the government's policies'. Mr Beith, who opposes a
national minimum wage, called for decentralisation of wage bargaining and
public transport and housing reforms to raise labour market flexibility.

FT  08 JUN 94 / Jobs shed in Tory seats
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Why pick today?'
This was the reaction of Mr Robert Sturdy, Conservative candidate for the
Cambridgeshire Euro-seat, to yesterday's announcement by Anglian Water that
it is to shed up to 900 jobs within three years. It must have been shared by
Conservatives throughout the constituency.
The announcement coincided with news from the Hampshire by-election town of
Eastleigh, which the Liberal Democrats are expected to win from the
Conservatives, that Pirelli, the cable maker, is to axe 136 jobs.
Mr Sturdy, standing in a seat the Tories should win and which contains Mr
John Major's parliamentary constituency, said he was worried about the
timing of Anglian Water's announcement, which came as the company announced
pre-tax profits for the year to the end of March of Pounds 132.2m.
'Why have they decided to say something today when the job losses are over
two to three years?' he said. 'One wonders if it is political. It makes me
wonder.'
Anglian said almost all the job cuts would be among administrative workers -
it is to close one of its two headquarters buildings, one of which is in
Huntingdon, the other in Cambridge.
At Eastleigh, Mr Stephen Reid, the Conservative candidate, said Pirelli's
decision was 'a fact of life'.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, said the job losses were
'likely to be as a direct result of the government's failure to invest in
training and infrastructure'.
Pirelli said the timing of the announcement had nothing to do with the
by-election. 'That is incidental to the running of our business,' it said.
'But we do expect some possible criticism.'

FT  08 JUN 94 / Major seeks to shore up support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major was in a buoyant mood last night as he made a last-ditch
attempt to shore up Tory support for tomorrow's European elections by
attacking the 'seven deadly sins' of his Labour and Liberal Democrat
opponents.
The prime minister used the last Tory rally of the campaign to spell out
issues on which the two main opposition parties were 'damagingly wrong'.
Addressing 500 party activists in a west London hotel, he spoke of his
'passionate conviction' that Britain should play a part in shaping Europe's
future and described 'this European Union of ours' as 'a very great
venture'.
But in a carefully-balanced speech he again conjured up a vision of a
flexible, multi-speed Europe with member states free to act in their own way
and at their own speed.
Flanked by Union Jacks, Mr Major was firm on defence, saying there was no
need 'for the Commission to be involved in the defence of Europe'.
He sought to undermine opposition charges that the government had broken its
promises on tax, saying that the Tories always planned for the long-term
good of the country - even when taking decisions that were unpopular.
Mr Major said Britain's EU veto, which the Tories would fight to keep, was
just one of the subjects on which Conservative views were different from
those of the other two leading parties.
Others included: deregulation, which the Tories stood for, while the other
two parties supported 'more regulation' and 'more powers' to go from Britain
to Brussels; the social chapter of the Maastricht treaty, which Labour and
the Liberal Democrats wished to impose; a single currency, which the other
two parties 'urged us to agree to . . . without leaving it to parliament to
decide'; taxes; EU spending; and Britain's EU rebate, which Mr Gordon Brown,
the shadow chancellor, 'says he would renegotiate'.
Mr Major was supported by Sir Norman Fowler, the Conservative party
chairman, who cautioned against the view that the Liberal Democrats
represented 'some middle way' on Europe.
In defiant mood, Sir Norman said Liberal Democrat policies were just as
'extreme' and 'damaging' as Labour's. Mr Major's recent comments about
'aggressive begging' were much closer to the views of the general public
than the response of the Liberal Democrats, he said.

FT  08 JUN 94 / OECD study fuels minimum pay row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A jobs study carried out by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development triggered a furious election row yesterday as Labour leaders
rejected Conservative claims that the study undermines Labour's plans for a
statutory minimum wage. With just two days left before polling, Mr John
Major said it was 'a great setback for Labour that independent experts have
looked at what they wish to do and said it is nonsense'.
Mr Major said on LBC radio that Labour wanted to 'interrupt markets and try
to regulate them, and the whole thrust of the report is in precisely the
opposite direction'.
But Mr John Prescott, shadow employment secretary, said the Conservatives
had 'deliberately misrepresented' the report to hide the 'catastrophic
economic failure' of deregulation.
He said the Tories had created a 'low-skill, low-investment, low-pay
economy' which could not protect against 'the onslaught of cheap competition
from low-wage economies'.
In a concerted attempt to extract maximum advantage from the report,
ministers said it demonstrated growing international support for
Conservative economic policies.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor, said it supported the government's argument
that job creation depends on supply-side reforms focusing on flexible labour
markets.
'These policies have helped us to get unemployment down by nearly 300,000
from its peak, while it has continued to rise elsewhere in Europe,' he said.
'They are now being endorsed by every international gathering that addresses
the problem of growth and employment.'
Mr David Hunt, employment secretary, said a minimum wage would be of most
benefit to the top 30 per cent of British wage earners because of the large
number of families with two incomes.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said the report was a
'remarkable endorsement of everything this government has been doing in the
1980s and 1990s'.
However, Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, said the report supported
Labour's emphasis on job creation through training, education and
international economic co-operation.
Labour officials said the report left open the option of a 'responsible'
minimum wage, even though it recommends abolition in countries which already
have such legislation.
They pointed to a passage suggesting that the 'adverse employment effects'
could be minimised by ensuring regional flexibility and indexing the minimum
wage to prices rather than earnings.
Neither Mr Brown nor Mr Prescott would comment on Labour's criteria for a
minimum wage, which are being considered by the party's economic commission.
Union leaders have pressed for a flat minimum wage of about Pounds 4 an
hour, but Labour said the commission's proposals, due next year, would be
'flexible and responsible'.
Mr Alan Beith, Liberal Democrat treasury spokesman, said the report was 'a
direct criticism of the government's policies'. Mr Beith called for
decentralisation of wage bargaining and public transport and housing reforms
to raise labour market flexibility.

FT  08 JUN 94 / Labour claims Eastleigh strength
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour yesterday claimed it was running second in tomorrow's Eastleigh
by-election as Mr Tony Blair, the front-runner for the Labour leadership,
said the party had become more attractive to people in the south of England.
Although Labour has privately conceded that it has no chance of winning the
contest - called after the death of the Conservative MP Stephen Milligan -
it is still hoping to push the Conservatives into third place.
However, Mr Paddy Ashdown, leader of the Liberal Democrats, who are expected
to take the seat, warned that anything but a vote for his party 'risks
putting another Tory MP into Westminster'.
Mr David Chidgey, the Liberal Democrat candidate, said he had met many
life-long Conservatives who said they would never vote for the government
again, but he cautioned against complacency.
'At the last election there were many people thinking of voting Liberal
Democrat who, in the last week, drifted back to the Tories,' he said.
Mr Blair, who spent yesterday morning at Eastleigh police station to discuss
crime prevention, made it clear at the morning press conference that he
thought Labour had made the necessary changes over the past 10 years for it
to have more appeal to southern voters, although he was unable to name the
last by-election which Labour won in the south of England.
By investing political capital in Eastleigh, Mr Blair has adopted a risky
strategy. If the party fails to come second it will be interpreted as a blow
to its hopes of winning more votes in the south of England.
Mr Stephen Reid, the Conservative candidate, denied that his party's vote
had collapsed, arguing that he was receiving 'a positive response
everywhere'.

The UK is uniquely placed to take a global stake in 'the biggest commercial
play of the next century' - the development of the information superhighway,
Professor David Youlton, chairman of broadcasting technology group Snell and
Wilcox, told the Royal Television Society last night.
Prof Youlton, the visiting professor of business studies at Kingston
University in London, said the UK could not claim pre-eminence in either
telecommunications or computers. However it had 'the world's largest and
most sophisticated knowledge base in the art of the moving image in real
time combined with a deep understanding of all that happens between the
transmitter and the receiver in the home.'

FT  08 JUN 94 / Channel 4 chief proposes alliance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Grade, chief executive of Channel 4, yesterday proposed an
alliance with the BBC in competition to ITV and satellite broadcasters,
Raymond Snoddy writes.
Mr Grade, a former director of programmes at the BBC, has turned his
attentions to the corporation after failing to persuade ITV to work with
Channel 4.
He suggested that Channel 4 and the BBC jointly make and distribute films,
produce drama and buy programmes from Hollywood. He said: 'We are natural
partners. We are not threats to each other's revenues and as public service
broadcasters we exist only to spend money on British programmes.'
Mr Grade is trying to wean the BBC away from a growing relationship with Sky
Television, a venture in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a
significant stake. He believes the BBC and Sky have jointly been buying
programmes in the US in addition to its Premier League football deal.
He said: 'I feel that the relationship between the BBC and Sky will end in
tears because there is a conflict. In the end a popular and successful BBC
will prevent Sky making a breakthrough.'

FT  08 JUN 94 / Further strikes planned at BBC
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BBC unions have rejected the corporation's 'final offer' on pay and
conditions and are threatening to take industrial action on Thursday, Friday
and Sunday.
Mr Tony Lennon, president of broadcasting union Bectu, said it was '99 per
cent likely' there would be industrial action although negotiators for the
NUJ journalists' union had been instructed to seek improvements.
Journalists and technical staff staged a 24-hour strike on May 24 in the
dispute over proposals for performance-related pay and changes to working
hours. Further action was called off when talks took place and the BBC
announced concessions to its proposals.
Last night the unions said that the revised package tabled by the BBC at the
conciliation service Acas failed to address their fundamental concerns.
The BBC said: 'During four days of negotiations at Acas, the BBC made
significant changes to its proposals to address the concerns expressed by
staff and unions.'

FT  08 JUN 94 / Customers ready to lay their accounts on the line: The
growth of services available by phone from banks and other financial
institutions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BT's recent advertising campaign encouraging people to spend more time
talking on the telephone will have sounded familiar to senior management in
high street banks and in insurance companies.
The growth in the range of telephone services offered by financial
institutions, leading to calls that can take as long as a trip to the bank
or a visit from a life insurance sales agent, has been rapid and is
continuing.
Just last month Direct Line, the telephone insurance company owned by Royal
Bank of Scotland, indicated that it was considering launching a credit card.
National &amp; Provincial building society has recently launched a telephone
branch offering a full mortgage service, and Abbey National Direct, the
first organisation to offer a telephone mortgage service, plans to expand
services for current account customers later this year.
After the success of First Direct, the telephone banking subsidiary of
Midland Bank, all the leading banks and some larger building societies have
now launched some form of telephone banking.
'People are much more ready to sort out their affairs on the telephone,'
said Mr John Spence, London and south-east regional manager for Lloyds Bank.
But First Direct remains the only stand-alone operation: the others are all
complementary to the branches, and are intended to improve the service to
customers by giving them another way of communicating with the bank.
While routine business, such as changes to standing orders or obtaining
personal loans, is now commonplace, most high street banks are still
cautious about executing complex transactions by phone.
Mr Malcolm Oliver, marketing director of Barclay Life, said: 'Some customers
prefer to deal over the phone all the time - if they're asking for a loan,
they find it easier to be turned down by a voice than turned down
face-to-face.'
He made an important distinction, however, between the day-to-day banking
transactions with which customers now feel confident on the telephone and
the detailed decision-making process involved in more complicated products.
Predictably, First Direct is bullish that its customers are as comfortable
dealing with mortgages and investment portfolios as with more
straightforward products and services such as motor insurance.
Among its self-selecting customer base this may be so, but it is not
necessarily true elsewhere.
Mr Charles Toner, managing director of Abbey National's retail division,
underlined that customers need to feel confident in dealing on the
telephone, when he pointed out that Abbey National Direct had hardly any
first-time buyers among its customers.
Alongside the growth in telephone mortgages is an increase in the range of
financial products such as life policies, pensions and investments that can
be bought by telephone.
Apart from Abbey's telephone operation, which has experimented on a small
scale with selling pensions, the drive in financial services products has
come not so much from the banks as insurers.
As Ms Sarah Deaves, senior manager with National Westminster Bank's remote
banking development, admitted: 'It may well not be appropriate to do it over
the phone. From September last year we have been experimenting with a
financial adviser at Prime Line (NatWest's premium telephone service) but
the process is quite cumbersome.'
Insurers tend to have a greater incentive in this sector. Without a branch
network to support, they see the opportunity to make the most of a low-cost
distribution channel, and pass savings on to the customer.
'The whole life and pensions world is looking at reducing costs,' said Mr
Alistair Milne, Prudential's managing director of direct marketing. 'There
are opportunities with certain product lines to be able to look at
differential pricing.'
Mr Bill Jack, general manager of GA Life, has predicted that writing
business over the telephone 'could even rival bancassurance' - the selling
of life and investment products by banks and building societies through
branch networks.
At present, the emphasis is on term assurance, which many insurers believe
can be segmented in a similar way to motor and household insurance, which
have been successfully sold over the phone.
But GA Life is among those already selling simple, single-premium investment
products by phone, and over time the range is expected to increase.
The rising regulatory standards for financial advice have not been a
problem: no organisation would be so foolish as to neglect to record calls
between customers and staff.
Against such a background, the determinant for expansion will be customer
comfort. 'The consumer ultimately will determine when the time is right,'
said Mr Milne.
On that basis, the end of the line for telephone banking and financial
services is a long way away.

FT  08 JUN 94 / Lloyd's will quiz former Gooda chief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Derek Walker, former chairman of Gooda Walker, the insurance managing
agents, has been formally charged by the disciplinary committee of Lloyd's
of London over his conduct while in charge of the company.
The move was disclosed yesterday by lawyers for Mr Walker in an attempt to
limit cross-examination of the former underwriter during the High Court
legal action brought against the agency by more than 3,000 Names.
Mr Walker will face the Lloyd's regulators charged with providing the Gooda
Walker auditors with false and misleading information and with discreditable
conduct.
The charges relate to his handling of 'time-and-distance' policies -
reinsurance policies allowing syndicates to manage reserves against claims
several years after the start of policies.
The time-and-distance policies agreed by Mr Walker were at the centre of a
Serious Fraud Office investigation of the Gooda Walker agency. The SFO
decided in April not to bring criminal charges against anyone connected with
Lloyd's.
Miss Claire Montgomery, for Mr Walker, told the court yesterday he should
not be questioned about the time-and-distance policies because there was a
danger he might incriminate himself in advance of the disciplinary hearing.
The SFO had reserved the right to reopen its investigation and this might
place Mr Walker at risk. She said the use of the policies raised questions
of criminal liability over the possible creation of a false or misleading
picture of Gooda Walker's profitability and possible false-accounting
offences.
Solicitors for the Names had agreed that Mr Walker should not be forced to
incriminate himself while the SFO investigation was in progress, she said.
The judge, Mr Justice Phillips, said this assurance no longer prevented Mr
Walker answering questions.
Giving evidence, Mr Walker denied the Names' claim that he had bought
inadequate reinsurance in the late 1980s for the risks underwritten by
syndicate 290, which he headed.
Mr Walker said the market for buying reinsurance had been difficult in the
late 1980s. He would have bought more if it had been available on the right
terms, but was 'reasonably happy' with the level of reinsurance he had
provided.
He refused to accept blame for the collapse of syndicate 290, and denied his
underwriting was in any way responsible. The winding-up of the syndicate had
been caused by the collapse of the excess loss market at Lloyd's and bad
decision-making by other Gooda Walker directors, he said.

FT  08 JUN 94 / Government to fund rise in students
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is funding an 8.6 per cent expansion in the number of
students enrolling at English further education colleges next year, which
already stands at 2.75m.
The announcement by the Further Education Funding Council for England, the
quango which controls budgets for the sector, signals the government's
continued determination to cut the number of 16-year-olds dropping out of
education.
Colleges were removed from local education authority control and set up as
independent corporations in April last year. This is the second full year of
funding from the council. It intends to direct funding towards specific
courses next year, after it has consulted local employers.
The total number of students in the sector - which covers vocational
education and adult education, A-levels and some degrees - is planned to
increase from the equivalent of 863,000 full-time students this year to
934,000 next year.
But officials believe colleges will overshoot targets, and come closer to
recruiting 950,000, as any extra recruits will attract extra 'demand-led'
funding. Total funds are Pounds 2.4bn, a 6 per cent increase on 1993-94.
If part-time students are included, total enrolment at the colleges could
exceed 3m.
'Payment for results' has been introduced to the new funding system, which
penalises colleges if students drop out of courses early or fail them.
Colleges also now have a greater incentive to recruit part-time students,
after complaints from employers that colleges were preoccupied last year
with recruiting 'cheaper' full-time A-level students.
Under the complex methodology adopted by the council, funding is provided
for 'units' of education which the college provides. Each unit is supposed
to be of equal cost. Thus a two-year BTec national diploma is worth 168
units, while a BTec first diploma, usually completed in one year, is worth
only 84 units. An A-level, normally taught in a classroom and therefore
cheaper to provide, is worth 56 units.
Expensive courses which require workshops or laboratories are worth more
units. The council believes it has valued units this year in such a way that
colleges will receive funding for the precise cost of each course. Units are
lost if students drop out or fail, and added if they pass their
qualifications.
Officials said they would consult local Training and Enterprise Councils and
local employers to see if colleges should be stimulated to offer particular
courses. This could be done next year by allocating courses extra units and
making them more profitable.
Ms Ruth Gee, chief executive of the Association for Colleges, which
represents college principals, said the announcement was 'very promising',
with 86 per cent of colleges receiving the funding they had requested in
full.
She added that the plans to encourage particular courses, coupled with the
competitiveness white paper published two weeks ago, marked 'a shift in
regional policy, and almost the reintroduction of sub-regional planning'.

FT  08 JUN 94 / Patten bows to pressure over truancy tables
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government will abandon its most controversial 'league tables' - those
for truancy - in English secondary schools this year, after complaints from
teachers, Mr John Patten, the education secretary, said yesterday.
In a series of concessions to teaching unions, most of whom oppose the
league tables, Mr Patten also announced plans to put exam results in more
context next year.
Last year the Department for Education published tables showing the
proportion of pupils at a school who had missed at least half a day during
the educational year. This produced high figures which many educationalists
dismissed as misleading. Several schools reported a truancy rate of more
than 80 per cent.
This year there will be two truancy tables. One will give the total
proportion of half-days missed by pupils without authorisation, while the
other will give similar figures for authorised absence.
Mr Patten also said that from next year he hoped to publish 'value-added'
figures to set exam results in context.
He suggested two simple measures in particular: one would convert schools'
performance in A-levels and GCSEs into an index and chart their improvement
over time, while the other would compare pupils' performance in national
tests taken at the age of 11 with their scores in tests taken at 14.
However, Mr Patten refused to promise value-added league tables for next
year.
The Schools Curriculum and Assessment Authority, the quango chaired by Sir
Ron Dearing, is investigating value-added measures. Mr Patten pointed out
that the team includes Professor Michael Barber of Keele University, a
former official of the National Union of Teachers.
Teachers' unions gave the changes a lukewarm reception. Mr Doug McAvoy,
general secretary of the NUT, said: 'Mr Patten's U-turn over the blunt
instrument he used to measure truancy last year hasn't changed his attitude
to crude statistics.'
Schools will also be required to publish information on the amount of time
pupils spend in class each week, after a finding by Ofsted, the education
watchdog, that the school day at some schools was 20 per cent longer than at
others.
Mr David Hart, general secretary of the National Association of Head
Teachers, said: 'The overwhelming majority of heads remain of the view that
the work involved in compiling these statistics is a monumental waste of
time.'
The Association of Teachers and Lecturers said teachers still had 'a lack of
faith in a system of league tables which gratuitously misunderstands how
schools work'.

FT  08 JUN 94 / Pounds 232,000 fine over securities selling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Securities regulators have fined David Coakley, a private client futures and
options firm, and its directors and employees a total of Pounds 232,000 for
using high-pressure sales tactics to sell to unsophisticated investors and
for 'churning' client accounts to gain commission, Norma Cohen writes.
Additional payments towards regulators' costs and client compensation brings
the total charges to Pounds 276,160.
The Securities and Futures Authority, which last year ordered the firm to
close, said that a disciplinary tribunal hearing had concluded that the
pattern of its activities were 'discreditable, reckless and scandalous'.
The firm was fined Pounds 100,000 and Mr David Coakley, its sole director,
was fined Pounds 50,000 and expelled from SFA registers. Mr Stewart Blake,
head of dealing was fined Pounds 30,000 and expelled from SFA registers.
Five account executives were fined amounts ranging from Pounds 20,000 to
Pounds 4,000.

FT  08 JUN 94 / New fizz on the box
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It's not the real thing. But J. Sainsbury has decided the television
advertisement for its new cola will go better with a few American icons
thrown in.
Unabashed by complaints last month from a certain well-known world market
leader, which forced Sainsbury to change the design on the outside of the
can, the food retailer is to run an advert which rummages through American
cultural baggage in search of increased sales.
A bemused employee watches an American basketball player in a limousine as
it pulls up outside a Sainsbury's superstore, whose car park is full of
American cars.
The slogan promises that Classic Cola - made from concentrate supplied by
Cott, the Canadian soft-drinks manufacturer - delivers a 'classic American
taste at a Sainsbury's price'.
The commercial shows Classic Cola's new packaging, although cans with this
design will not go on sale until late July. Sainsbury altered the typography
of the design - white italic lettering on a red background - after Coca-Cola
complained that its resemblance to Coca-Cola's cans might confuse customers.
Mr Ivor Hunt, Sainsbury's marketing director, denied that the advertisement
was a response to heavy advertising by Coca-Cola, and said the advert - to
coincide with the time of year when soft drink sales are highest - had been
budgeted for since Classic Cola was launched.
'It is a logical and necessary stage in the post-launch development of the
brand,' he said. 'It is much better to get the product in (the stores) and
make sure the logistics are in place before starting the advertising.'
The Classic Cola advert was developed by the creative consultancy Fourhead.
Sainsbury's usual agency, Abbott Mead Vickers BBDO, faced a potential
conflict of interest with another client - Pepsi.

FT  08 JUN 94 / Government warned over 'unfit' housing
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A 'housing underclass' is being created in Britain with more than 1.5m
people forced to pay rent for homes that are unfit for habitation, the Royal
Institute of British Architects said yesterday.
The institute called for action to alleviate the problem in a report - part
of National Housing Week - and blamed lack of coherent government policy.
The institute said the existence of 700,000 rented homes that were unfit for
habitation was unacceptable and it warned that the longer repair work was
delayed, the higher the eventual repair costs would be.
It called on the government to help people seeking to improve their homes.
A housing 'underclass' had been created, it warned. Most homes in the middle
and top range had improved over the past few years, but those at the bottom
had got worse.

FT  08 JUN 94 / Call to exploit TV superhighway
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK is uniquely placed to take a global stake in 'the biggest commercial
play of the next century' - the development of the information superhighway,
the Royal Television Society heard last night.
Professor David Youlton, chairman of broadcasting technology group Snell and
Wilcox, said the UK could not claim pre-eminence in either
telecommunications or computers but it had 'the world's largest and most
sophisticated knowledge base in the art of the moving image in real time
combined with a deep understanding of all that happens between the
transmitter and the receiver in the home.'
Mr Youlton, who is visiting professor of business studies at Kingston
University in London, praised the BBC Research Department as being the
broadcasting equivalent of Nasa, the US space agency, by producing a
constant stream of spin-off technology.
US technology in this area had been impoverished by the closure or hiving
off of the research laboratories of the US networks.

FT  08 JUN 94 / World Trade News: UK seeks to reverse import curbs on toys
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Business Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Department of Trade and Industry has taken the EU Council of Ministers
to the European Court of Justice in an attempt to annul the Council's
decision earlier this year to place stringent quotas on imports of teddy
bears and other toys from China.
The DTI's legal action follows complaints by European toy importers that
quotas are severely damaging business. Though Britain opposed the decision
to impose the curbs, it was outvoted by 11 to 1.
The European Commission, which drew up the original quota proposals, said it
was 'surprised' by the legal action, because ways were already being sought
in Brussels to soften the impact of the curbs on the European toy industry.
EU member governments regularly challenge Council decisions in the court
after they have been overruled. But legal experts said the DTI action was
most unusual because it did not allege that the Council had misused its
treaty powers.
Instead, the DTI argues that the Council 'failed to exercise discretion
properly' by ignoring objections from European toy manufacturers. It also
says an EU-wide quota was unnecessary, because only Spain had demanded
protection against toy imports from China.
Toy Manufacturers of Europe, the main industry association, said the quotas
would cut EU toy imports from China this year by about Ecu 1.8bn at
manufacturers' selling prices to half the level forecast before they were
imposed in February.
It said that at least 500 jobs would be lost in Europe and that toy
manufacturers, many of whom sourced products and components in China, would
suffer falls in sales and profits.

FT  08 JUN 94 / World Trade News: BA seeks to enter China air ventures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Airways is among a growing number of large western airlines stepping
up efforts to participate in the modernisation of the fast-expanding Chinese
air transport industry through joint ventures and other partnerships with
Chinese carriers.
BA is already co-operating with China Southern, the Guangzhou-based airline,
and is in talks with Shanghai-based China Eastern Airlines, Mr David Holmes,
BA's director of government and international affairs, said yesterday.
Like other international carriers, BA now sees more promising long-term
opportunities in China than in Russia where its project to start a new
airline called Air Russia has been placed on hold indefinitely.
In contrast to Russia, China offered an administrative framework to conduct
daily business while in Russia it was currently difficult to advance on any
project until the political situation stabilised, Mr Holmes said.
The Civil Aviation Administration of China and Chinese airlines have also
become increasingly conscious of their technical weakness and the urgent
need to improve safety, punctuality and efficiency standards in the face of
explosive domestic air traffic growth which is averaging 20 per cent a year.
This week's crash of a China Northeast Airline's Russian-built Tupolev
Tu-154, in which 160 people died, has added to the urgency of overhauling
the country's aviation system.
It was China's worst air disaster.
China is also keen to commercialise its state-controlled airline industry
and is proposing to sell stakes to foreign investors in its 33 regional
carriers. It has also recently suggested the possibility of listing some of
the bigger carriers on the New York Stock Exchange in an effort to secure
outside financing.
BA is not currently pushing to take a stake in one or more Chinese airlines
but its longer-term ambition is to negotiate a marketing agreement with a
carrier such as Chinese Eastern to co-ordinate services at Beijing airport.
BA, however, recently hosted a visit of Chinese aviation officials to the UK
to discuss the possible way forward for Chinese airline privatisation.
With China Southern, which operates a fleet of Boeing aircraft, BA, which is
also a big Boeing operator, has formed an engineering joint venture. It also
recently sold China Southern some computering services. BA sees pilot
training as another area of possible co-operation with Chinese carriers.
BA, which flies twice a week from London to Beijing and is keen to double
its weekly services, is anxious to establish a stronger foothold in China at
a time when some of its main international competitors are intensifying
co-operation with the Chinese airline industry.
Lufthansa of Germany already operates six flights a week to Beijing and is
involved in a large aircraft maintenance centre in the Chinese capital.
Singapore Airlines has earmarked China as one of its three main growth areas
for the next decade together with India and Vietnam. It has taken a 40 per
cent stake in the company handling ground services at Beijing airport and
another 40 per cent stake in Beijing airport's inflight kitchen group.
Singapore Airline's engineering subsidiary has also invested in a 10 per
cent stake in the Xiamen joint aircraft engineering venture which includes
as partners Cathay Pacific and Japan Air Lines. Its recently formed leasing
company has leased a Boeing 767 to China Southern.

West European governments lost at least Dollars 200m (Pounds 133m) in 1993
through Vat avoidance because of computer software piracy, according to
figures published this week, writes Alan Cane. Their losses were small,
however, compared with those of the major software companies who
conservatively lost a total Dollars 737m (Pounds 489m) according to the
Software Publishers Association, with a further Dollars 436m lost by

FT  08 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Way clear for Philippines debt talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The International Monetary Fund will grant the Philippines a Dollars 630m
(Pounds 418m) 'exit facility' by the end of this month, enabling it to start
on debt negotiations with the Paris Club of creditors, according to Mr
Rizalino Navarro, the Philippines trade and investment secretary. 'Then
we'll be on our own,' he said.
Although soft loans will still be needed, the country's coffers are flush
with foreign exchange. Reserves are at a high of Dollars 7.2bn and the equal
of four months of imports which, he says, is 'getting on the high side'.
Galvanised by the country's widely praised fast-track power programme and a
new enthusiasm of the capital markets, Mr Navarro was in Washington to guard
Filipino interests in the Generalised System of Preferences which gives
tariff-free status to selected imports from developing countries.
The US has also removed the Philippines from its 'priority watch list' of
countries whose laws or enforcement of intellectual property statutes are
lax. This paves the way for increased high technology production facilities,
Mr Navarro said.
The government of President Fidel Ramos has moved on several fronts to boost
trade and investment. A new law expands the scope of permissible
build-operate-transfer deals.
The previous concentration on energy and transportation has been expanded to
include solid waste management, information technology, data base networks,
health and education facilities, and any infrastructure project authorised
by the government.
It is also comprehensive in the types of arrangements permitted. A public
utility franchise requires that 60 per cent of equity in the operating
corporation must be domestically owned. However, among new options, foreign
companies can now build a facility, lease it and transfer it or rehabilitate
a project, operate it and transfer it.
The previous 12 per cent ceiling on equity returns has been replaced by a
'reasonable returns' requirement to be set by market conditions.
The impact of the law, along with a new valued added tax, has been to spur
project approvals from Dollars 3.5bn last year to Dollars 9bn in the first
five months of this year.
Banking legislation, signed by President Ramos two weeks ago, is also
expected to boost trade and investment. It will allow the entry of 10 new
foreign banks to the country - four others have been there for more than 50
years when the door to new entrants has slammed shut.
'There is a lot of interest from the US, Japan, Europe and other Asian
countries,' Mr Navarro said. Banks usually bring their clients, who bring
more investment and facilitate trade.
The hope is that the new capital and foreign competition will drive down
interest rates nets, now at 18 per cent for borrowers.

FT  08 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Boom time for smugglers' paradise - The
contraband business on Pakistan's border with Afghanistan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FARHAN BOKHARI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Mohammad Shafi leans across his shop counter and points towards a small
'Peacock' brand Chinese television lying in a corner.
'You won't ever get it as cheap as here' claims the sturdy, tall tribesman,
whose shop is lined with a large variety of electronic goods such as air
conditioners, refrigerators, stereo equipment and fancy electronic
telephones.
Mr Haji Mohammad, another shopkeeper nearby shouts at two of his assistants,
who are off-loading a fresh consignment of electrical goods which arrived in
a truck before sunrise, using a mountainous track to conveniently evade
police check-posts along the road leading to the border. Mr Mohammad wants
the consignment of refrigerators to be placed neatly outside his shop before
customers arrive.
Both shopkeepers are among hundreds of businesses at Hayatabad market
outside Peshawar, Pakistan's northern frontier town, whose fortunes have
risen as smuggling has flourished in this country in the past 12 to 15
years.
The market has much more to offer for all clients such as expensive
crockery, unstitched cloth, Italian shoes, perfumes from Paris and even
aphrodisiacs neatly packed in tiny square boxes with instructions in Chinese
and Russian, hidden under labels in English.
The market and other similar sites across the country are catching the eye
of a growing number of businesses who are opposing the government's plans to
introduce a VAT-style general sales tax.
At a time when markets such as Hayatabad freely sell goods without charging
any addition taxes, other businesses say the sales tax would break their
back because it would further encourage their clients to buy smuggled goods.
'Whichever government has come, the menace of smuggling has only grown,'
laments Mr Tahir Khaliq, a top businessman in Karachi, Pakistan's southern
most city and the country's business capital.
In over a year, one of Mr Khaliq's company has produced just over 1,000
'Peacock' televisions, although he had initially planned to assemble and
sell twice that many.
Mr Khaliq traces his troubles back to a place such as Hayatabad, over 1,600
km away, where shopkeepers can easily beat his prices.
'Our customers are being offered the same goods at up to 60 per cent of our
price, and the goods are even delivered at their doorsteps,' claims Mr
Khaliq, referring to the well-organised smuggling trade, reputed to have an
annual turnover of Rupees 100bn (Pounds 2.18bn).
The smuggling business flourishes in part due to widespread corruption in
the police and taxation departments. Moreover, Pakistan's agreement to
provide transit facilities for imports by businesses based in neighbouring
Afghanistan is widely abused.
Yet, companies in remote places there place orders for a large number of
refrigerators, freezers and so on. 'Why is that so,' asks a senior
government official. He says Pakistani smugglers in collusion with Afghan
businesses take the imported items to cross the Afghan border using the
transit facility, and then bring them back using remote mountain tracks.
Privately, senior officials say the government is considering ways to curb
the traffic in items for which there is little or no demand in Afghanistan.
But it has to act fast and finalise its proposals before next summer, when a
30-year-old bilateral trade agreement comes up for renewal.
But the same officials also acknowledge that a solution is difficult,
especially as Islamabad does not want to erode its diplomatic influence over
Afghanistan, which it has gained since it began backing the Islamic
mujahideen resistance to the Soviet occupation in 1979.

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BUENOS AIRES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Argentina's trade deficit widened sharply in the first four months of the
year, further raising concern about the country's export competitiveness and
the sustainability of its fixed exchange rate, write John Barham and Stephen
Fidler in Buenos Aires.
Latest figures show the deficit grew nearly five-fold to Dollars 2.4bn
(Pounds 1.59bn) from Dollars 500m in the same period last year. But analysts
expect a deficit of about Dollars 7bn for the year, roughly double last
year's trade gap. Argentina has run a trade deficit nearly every month since
Mr Domingo Cavallo, economy minister, pegged the currency to the dollar in
April 1991.
But he denied the trade figures were alarming because they showed on the one
hand a sharp increase in exports of manufactures and on the other a large
inflow of capital goods.
Investment was 28 per cent higher in the first quarter compared with a year
ago, while consumption grew only 4 per cent, Mr Cavallo added.
'For the first time ever, investments have resulted in productivity gains
allowing an increase in exports despite growing domestic demand.'
In the past, when the economy grew, as it is now, exports fell. Now, said Mr
Cavallo, 'exports of manufactures are showing an increase of 28 per cent,
achieved through a rise in productivity. I have no doubt Argentina will have
a greater ability to export owing to increases in productivity.'

FT  08 JUN 94 / IMF considers loans as a defence against speculation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The International Monetary Fund is considering the possibility of setting up
a new loan facility to provide money in a hurry for countries whose
currencies come under short term speculative attack.
Mr Michel Camdessus, the IMF's managing director, said yesterday that a
short term facility of this sort 'would help cushion the reserves of
countries suddenly subjected to bursts of speculation in spite of policies
that Fund surveillance has found to be appropriate.'
Such a facility would help member countries implementing sound policies to
avoid being pushed off track by wayward and temporary losses of confidence
among international investors,' Mr Camdessus told the Institute for
International Economics, a Washington economic policy think tank, at a lunch
meeting yesterday.
As more countries have removed curbs on capital movements, and as the
international capital markets have become more global, more and more
countries, including newly industrialised nations in Asia and Latin America,
have become vulnerable to sudden currency flows.
In a speech which was his first major discussion of the IMF's role in its
fiftieth anniversary year, Mr Camdessus insisted that the Fund remained very
much a monetary institution, even if most of its loans now went to
developing nations and the former centrally-planned economies.
'We continue to address monetary problems, balance of payments problems,
with monetary resources,' Mr Camdessus said.
'It is not because you add a subsidy so as not to overburden countries which
are already burdened that you become an aid agency.'
Part of the appeal of a short-term facility to combat currency fluctuations,
however, would be that it would be available to industrialised countries
which have scarcely called on the IMF's resources in the last twenty years,
even though the largest industrialised countries would be unlikely to need
it.
Discussion of the facility is, however, very preliminary.
Its architecture poses considerable problems: how do you attach the IMF's
traditional economic policy conditions to a facility which by definition
must provide money instantly to face sudden speculative movements?

The two nations recently broke a three-month deadlock to get negotiations
going again.
The original sectors - still under negotiation - are cars and car parts,

Mr Kantor said negotiators held talks yesterday in Paris on financial
services but he had no report of the outcome.
There will also be talks on films and other audiovisual products.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Quebec separatists have caused controversy in Canada's investment community
over the past week by threatening to withdraw business from banks and
securities firms which draw attention to the economic costs of a possible
breakaway by the francophone province.
The threats come amid nervousness in financial markets about the forthcoming
Quebec election, which is expected to be held in September.
The separatist Parti Quebecois (PQ) is well ahead of the ruling Liberals in
public opinion polls. If it wins, the PQ has promised to hold an
independence referendum within a year of coming to office.
Mr Jacques Parizeau, the PQ's leader, urged Quebeckers to shun Bank of
Montreal, one of the biggest financial institutions in the province, after
the bank's chief economist warned that the PQ would create 'a great deal of
fear' in financial markets if it treated an election victory as a mandate to
launch independence negotiations.
A similar warning last week by Wood Gundy, a Toronto-based securities
dealer, elicited a veiled threat from the PQ that the firm risked exclusion
from underwriting the province's bonds, if the separatist group comes to
power.
The political uncertainty has contributed to a widening gap between Quebec
and other Canadian bond yields, as well as rising spreads between Canadian
and US government bonds. Foreigners hold an estimated 25 per cent of
Canadian public-sector debt.
The spread between Quebec and federal government 10-year bonds has grown in
the past month from 85/100ths of a percentage point to about 1.03 points.
By contrast, bonds issued by the province of Alberta now yield only 50
points above federal government issues.
PQ leaders hope to reassure Quebec voters that a breakaway will be
relatively painless, since an independent Quebec would continue to benefit
from the North American free trade agreement and from close economic ties
with the rest of Canada.
An economist at one domestic bank said yesterday that it was impossible to
make an accurate forecast of Quebec's economic prospects under an
independence-minded government.
But he noted that uncertainty among foreign investors about the future shape
of Canada 'is inevitably going to cause some dislocation in financial
markets.'

FT  08 JUN 94 / Firebrand ignites Mexican poll: The opposition candidate
threatening continued rule by the PRI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A few months ago he was dismissed as a right-wing eccentric with a loud
voice. Now Mr Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, presidential candidate of
Mexico's conservative opposition, is mounting a serious challenge to the
governing party's 65-year hold on power.
Public support for Mr Fernandez de Cevallos, the candidate of the National
Action party, has surged after his clear victory in the televised debate
between the three main candidates. In less than a month, he has moved from
third place to being close to or ahead of Mr Ernesto Zedillo, the ruling
Institutional Revolutionary party (PRI) nominee, in opinion polls.
A trial lawyer and experienced parliamentarian, Mr Fernandez de Cevallos has
proved a far more engaging and colourful speaker than his sombre rivals.
Easily identified by his sprawling beard and cigar, his confrontational but
good-humoured style has turned him into something of a folk hero for
Mexicans looking for an alternative to the cold technicians who have run the
country for the past decade.
His description of Mr Zedillo as a 'good little boy with high grades who has
not passed the test of democracy' may have done more to define the PRI
candidate than months of government propaganda. His withering attacks on Mr
Cuauhtemoc Cardenas look to have finished off the presidential ambitions of
the candidate of the left, once considered the strongest of the two
opposition nominees.
Mr Fernandez de Cevallos still faces considerable obstacles in his quest to
unseat the PRI, and even some supporters acknowledge that he has at best an
outside chance of victory. With memory of the debate fading, there are
already signs that his support is beginning to soften.
The ruling PRI is better organised than the PAN, has more money and is
backed by the television networks, the unions, big business and the farmers'
organisations. Polls show that voters are more confident of its ability to
manage the economy and worried about political instability that might follow
a change in government.
The PAN's core support is the urban middle-class, and even within that group
many are suspicious of its conservative, pro-church views on social policy.
The party is hardly represented in the rural parts of Mexico, where 30 per
cent of Mexicans live, a weakness not reflected in the opinion polls, which
generally exclude voters in the countryside.
But the surge in popularity of the combative Mr Fernandez de Cevallos has
revealed the vulnerability of the PRI and the volatility of the electorate.
Even if Mr Fernandez de Cevallos does not win the election, he could draw
enough votes to prevent the PRI winning majority control of the Congress,
forcing it to govern with the support of the opposition for the first time.
Apart from his success in the debate, Mr Fernandez de Cevallos's campaign
has benefited from discontent with the government, fuelled by economic
stagnation and political turmoil that began with the peasant revolt in
Chiapas over New Year. He has cleverly positioned himself as the candidate
of change, but who unlike the leftist opposition, can maintain political and
social order.
'We have finished the myth that the candidate of the PRI is invincible,' Mr
Fernandez de Cevallos said in a recent interview. 'All of society is
demanding change, indicating that the moment of the PAN has come.'
His message of conservative and cautious political reform may have been
given a boost by the assassination of Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio, the former
PRI presidential candidate. The murder of the PRI candidate, along with
recent kidnappings and an increase in drug-related violence, appears to have
shifted public opinion to the right, helping Mr Fernandez de Cevallos at the
expense of Mr Cardenas.
Unlike Mr Cardenas, Mr Fernandez de Cevallos approves of most of the
pro-market economic policies of the current administration. If elected, he
says would fully open sectors such as banking to foreign capital, allow
limited private investment in the protected petroleum industry, introduce
more competition in telecommunications and broadcasting, and decentralise
federal powers to the states.
But compared with the detailed positions put out by Mr Zedillo, Mr Fernandez
de Cevallos's proposals are vague, and among his small team of advisers
there are no well-known economists or businessmen. In some economic
policies, he is probably to the left of the governing party, keener on
protecting small businesses from the effects of free trade and, for example,
supporting a controlled devaluation of the currency of about 20-25 per cent.
To reassure voters worried about his lack of administrative experience, Mr
Fernandez de Cevallos says he will invite members of other parties to join
his government. Advisers to Mr Fernandez de Cevallos encourage rumours that
Mr Pedro Aspe, the finance minister, will be asked to remain in his job if
their candidate wins the presidential election.
Mr Aspe has yet to comment on such rumours. But if the campaign remains
close, the pressure on him and other well-trained officials in the governing
party to distance themselves from the firebrand candidate of the
centre-right opposition is sure to grow.

FT  08 JUN 94 / Concern over exports as Argentina trade deficit widens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM and STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BUENOS AIRES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Argentina's trade deficit widened sharply in the first four months of the
year, further raising concern over the country's export competitiveness and
the sustainability of its fixed exchange rate.
Latest figures show the deficit grew nearly five-fold to Dollars 2.4bn
(Pounds 1.59bn) from Dollars 500m in the same period last year. But analysts
expect a deficit of about Dollars 7bn for the year, roughly double last
year's trade gap. Argentina has run a trade deficit nearly every month since
Mr Domingo Cavallo, economy minister, pegged the currency to the dollar in
April 1991.
But he denied the trade figures were alarming because they showed on the one
hand a sharp increase in exports of manufactures and on the other a large
inflow of capital goods.
The deficit was due mainly to sluggish exports of agricultural and
industrial commodities.
Investment was 28 per cent higher in the first quarter compared with a year
ago, while consumption grew only 4 per cent, Mr Cavallo added.
'For the first time ever, investments have resulted in productivity gains
allowing an increase in exports despite growing domestic demand.'
In the past, when the economy grew, as it is now, exports fell. Now, said Mr
Cavallo, 'exports of manufactures are showing an increase of 28 per cent,
achieved through an increase in productivity. I have no doubt Argentina will
have a greater ability to export owing to increases in productivity.'
He emphasised that a large proportion of the imports were composed of
capital goods, indicating companies were investing more and laying the
foundations for a strong export sector. In the first quarter, government
figures show imports of capital doubled to Dollars 1.53bn.
However, analysts complain government statistics are poor, making it hard to
corroborate this. They suspect the government is over-estimating the volume
of capital goods imports.
Mr Francisco Macri, president of Socma, one of Argentina's most powerful
industrial groups, said yesterday: 'There are few imports of capital goods
and more imports of consumer goods and this is not good.'
Mr Macri, whose companies build nearly half the cars made in Argentina,
claimed car imports alone last year were worth Dollars 3bn.
Despite the disappointing trade figures, inflation continues to fall. In
May, retail prices rose 0.3 per cent, bringing the 12-month figure to 3.4
per cent, the lowest in 41 years.

FT  08 JUN 94 / Middle East and Gulf growth rates halve
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   AMMAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The overall growth rate for the economies of the Gulf and other leading
Middle Eastern states more than halved in 1993 from its level the preceding
year, slumping to an aggregate 3.5 per cent from 6.8 per cent, according to
a newly-published report by the Economic and Social Commission for Western
Asia, the Amman-based United Nations agency.
The ESCWA study, which covers the seven Arabian Peninsula states and Egypt,
Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria, lists low oil prices, poor export
performances, continued sanctions on Iraq's economy, political uncertainties
in Egypt and Yemen and 'the generally depressed state of regional
co-operation' as the chief factors in the decline.
Only two states, Yemen and Qatar, recorded negative growth rates in 1993,
the report says, but weak oil prices helped cut aggregate GDP growth for the
Gulf Co-operation Countries (Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, Bahrain, Qatar and
the United Arab Emirates) to a rate of 3.3 per cent from 7.5 per cent in
1992.
More positively, the report notes that economic reforms 'gained momentum',
particularly in Jordan, which recorded 6 per cent growth in 1993 and where
both inflation and unemployment were substantially reduced, and Egypt, which
the report says showed growth the same year of 1.8 per cent. But it says
delays in Egypt's implementation of reforms and disagreements with the IMF
and World Bank have had a 'negative impact on economic growth and the state
of investors' confidence'.
The report also notes the positive effects of Lebanon's stabilisation policy
 -which it calls 'implicitly in line' with IMF recommendations - and Syrian
policies which, it says, are 'aimed at gradually opening up and deregulating
the economy'. Both Lebanon and Syria showed improved growth in 1993 over
1992, the study says, with rates rising to 7 from 5 per cent and to 6 from 5
per cent respectively.
However, it says that generally positive growth rates have failed to arrest
increasing discrepancies within the countries it covers: 'The majority of
the poor and rural population continues to be deprived and marginalised in
most countries of the ESCWA region.'
The report estimates total external debt of the region to have grown to
Dollars 186bn (Pounds 124bn) from Dollars 180bn over the period,
representing 62 per cent of aggregate GDP in 1993. While it says Egypt and
Jordan, in particular, have recently improved the terms of their debt
repayment, the report notes the region's external debt constituted 11.5 per
cent of total developing country debt.

FT  08 JUN 94 / Jordan and Israel in peace talks progress
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES WHITTINGTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   AMMAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Jordan and Israel achieved a breakthrough in their peace talks yesterday by
agreeing to implement a number of items listed on their peace 'agenda'
signed last September.
After two days of talks in Washington, the two countries agreed to set up a
commission on boundaries and water disputes and to carry out a number of
joint infrastructure and development projects. They also decided to hold
future negotiations, for the first time, in either Israel or Jordan.
Earlier, Mr Jawad Anani, a senior official in the Jordanian government, said
the most important obstacle to better relations was the dispute over the
exact demarcation of the countries' borders. The border between Jordan and
Israel,pencilled out by Winston Churchill in 1922, has never been formally
recognised.
'For practical reasons, we need to decide once and for all on our borders
before other agreements are possible,' he said. The establishment of a joint
commission to examine the disputed border has been a key Jordanian demand.
The agreement came as Jordan announced a cabinet reshuffle. The current
prime minister, Mr Abdel Salam al-Majali, is expected to retain his post but
officials say that new faces will be brought into other positions to
'reinvigorate' the government and the new phase in the peace process.
It was not clear last night who would appear in the new cabinet. The lower
house of parliament has been calling for representation of MPs at cabinet
level, as in previous governments, but a former minister said that this 'was
doubtful'.
The Jordanian/Israeli agreement includes: the construction of a road along
the coastline of the Gulf of Aqaba linking Jordan, Israel and Egypt; a
decision to draft an outline of future trade and economic relations, which
will be co-ordinated with the Palestinians; the convening of a special
sub-committee on joint tourism ventures; and co-ordination on establishing a
transboundary cultural heritage park in the Rift Valley which lies along the
Jordanian/Israeli border, south of the Dead Sea.
The chief Israeli negotiator, Mr Eli Rubinstein, described the agreement as
'meaningful' while Jordan's ambassador to Washington, Mr Fawez Tarawneh,
said it 'far exceeded our expectations'.

FT  08 JUN 94 / S African rights probe planned: 'Truth commission' to be set
up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The South African government is to set up a 'truth commission' to probe
human rights abuses under apartheid, but those who prove their crimes were
politically motivated might be pardoned, Justice Minister Dullah Omar said
yesterday.
Mr Omar said the commission of eminent and respected South Africans would
examine abuses by the previous white-dominated government as well as by his
own African National Congress (ANC), now the leading party in the coalition
government of national unity.
'The fundamental issue for all South Africans is to come to terms with our
past on the only moral basis possible, namely that the truth be told and
that the truth be acknowledged,' he told a Cape Town press conference. 'We
cannot forgive on behalf of victims. The identity of the victims and what
happened to them and the identity of perpetrators must be made known.'
However Mr Omar left many important questions unanswered, including whether
the commission would hold public hearings, whether its findings would be
published and whether those who committed abuses would have their identity
concealed in the interests of national reconciliation. No decision had yet
been taken on these issues, he said, and no definition of a political crime
had been agreed, though he said persons who committed 'heinous crimes' might
not be considered for pardon.
This was understood to be a reference to the convicted murderers of former
ANC leader Chris Hani, assassinated last year in the country's most
notorious political killing. Mr Omar said some 13,000 people had already
been pardoned for offences ranging from membership of an illegal
organisation to racially motivated massacres, most of them from the black
liberation movements.
In future, amnesty would be linked to the acknowledgement of human rights
violations.
Human rights monitors say tens of thousands of people including children
were tortured and detained without trial and hundreds killed under
apartheid. No amnesty would be considered for offences after December 5,
1993, when the final round of multi-party democracy talks began. Omar said
the commission would sit for up to two years.

Jordan yesterday announced a cabinet reshuffle in expectation of a fresh
phase of peace negotiations with Israel. Prime Minister Abdel Salam
al-Majali is expected to keep his post but officials say new faces will be
brought into other key positions to 'reinvigorate' the government and its
efforts in the peace process.
The change came amid optimism from the Jordanians that a breakthrough in its
peace talks with Israel was imminent. On Monday, Jordan and Israel restarted
direct talks in Washington on their peace agenda signed in September last
year.
Officials in Amman said they expected the two sides to agree to set up a
joint committee to examine the countries' land dispute. The border between
Jordan and Israel has never been formally recognised; both sides are said to
see the need to settle territorial issues before moving to others such as
water, economic co-operation and refugees.
It was not clear last night who would appear in the new cabinet. The lower
house of parliament has been calling for representation of MPs at cabinet
level, as in previous governments, but a former minister said this 'was
doubtful'.
The last cabinet reshuffle came after the kingdom held its first multi-party
elections last November. Since then, the government and parliament have had
frequent stand-offs. The cabinet has come in for criticism over its handling
of talks with the Palestinian Liberation Organisation on future economic
ties between Jordan and the West Bank.
One former prime minister, Mr Ahmad Obediat, said the old cabinet lacked
clear policies; he blamed its members for the uncertainty in the kingdom.
The new cabinet, it is hoped, will be able to restore confidence in the
peace talks.

FT  08 JUN 94 / Bombed Aden goes about its business

   ADEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Two north Yemeni warplanes hit the Aden oil refinery with cluster bombs,
sending a massive column of black smoke and flickering orange flame hundreds
of feet into the air.
The attack, on Sunday, was the third and most intensive air raid on the city
in a week and brought home forcefully the war that has raged out of view for
more than a month. But Adenis, like many other people under fire, are not
cowering. They are angered by the attacks on their homes and most remain
determined to resist what they perceive as aggression from the north.
Aden is a sprawling town, its population of half a million clustered in and
around the barren rocks of ancient volcanoes. The heart of the place is
Crater, a veritable melting pot of races and nationalities that teem through
its sweltering streets.
Up Bazaar Street merchants are selling everything from boxes of Ribena to
bottles of exclusive French perfume. On the pavement, intent young men work
with small screwdrivers and tweezers, repairing watches while you wait.
There is no sign of anxiety as people saunter to and fro in search of
bargains.
In Maala, another district of the town, people have been without water for
five days. No one knows quite why, nor do they stop to wonder about it much.
Children in their hundreds are on the streets with bright yellow plastic
bottles and make-shift wheelbarrows, dispatched to water wells dug in the
streets. Two boys race, laughing as their empty yellow bottles tumble on to
the road.
'Yes, we are having problems. The military has commandeered our buses and
that makes getting to work difficult,' says one office manager in the Tuwahi
district.
'But we come as we can and do what we can. We are not afraid. We are sure
that our defences will hold. We are very proud of what they have done so
far,' he says.
It is more than a month since north Yemeni military forces began their drive
on Aden and other parts of the south. General Ali Abdullah Saleh, the
northern leader, has since frequently boasted of arriving in the city to
chew qat, the privet-like leaves everyone in the land munches to keep awake
in the afternoon.
'General Saleh has made many appointments, but he's so far failed to
arrive,' notes a secretary.
About 20 miles north of the city, a dozen southern troops settle down for
lunch. It is rice and grilled chicken, spread in huge platters on the
concrete floor. They lean their AK-47s against the walls and begin to take
their food by the handful. Northern artillery shells rip through the air,
crashing nearby. The soldiers continue their meal, barely looking up as the
walls shake around them.
Last week one of the most ferocious battles of the war was fought here, the
burned out remains of a southern army camp only the most visible sign of the
struggle.
But there are more ghastly reminders. Southern troops point to the corpse of
a northern soldier, his face respectfully covered in a chequered headcloth.
Other corpses of northern soldiers are buried en masse in makeshift graves
alongside the road. The stench of death rises from the road where southern
troops stand ready for a new northern offensive.
'Our defences will hold,' says a spindly old man in Crater. Perhaps they
will. Northern troops massed to the east have been held off for nearly six
weeks, as have other soldiers driving in from the north and west.
Smoke still rises above the refinery, a reminder of the north's destructive
power. But southern pilots, defying incoming northern shells, continue their
sorties, taking off with clockwork precision every 10 minutes throughout the
morning.
Meanwhile, traffic in the city carries on in an orderly manner, directed by
policemen wearing pale green uniforms and sparkling white hats.

FT  08 JUN 94 / Kashmir gunmen kidnap Britons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL, Asia Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two Britons, including the 16-year-old son of a former Financial Times
correspondent, have been kidnapped in Indian-held Kashmir by Moslem
militants demanding the release of three jailed guerrillas.
The gunmen set upon Mr David Housego, former New Delhi correspondent of the
FT and now a Delhi-based businessman, his wife Jenny and younger son Kim as
they were trekking on Monday with Mr David Mackie, a British video director.
Kim Housego and Mr Mackie, who is 36, were abducted. Mr and Mrs Housego
yesterday returned to Srinagar, summer capital of the Indian state of Jammu
and Kashmir, and contacted the authorities.
The Indian army was alerted and photographs of the captives distributed.
However, there was no indication of any contact between the Indian
authorities and the militants.
Mr Housego said the captors appeared to be mostly Pathans who spoke both
Pashto and Urdu, suggesting that at least some of them were from Pakistan.
He was given a note in Urdu demanding the release of three men who are known
to be members of the Harkatul Ansar militant group, including its leader, Mr
Mohammed Sajjad. All are in Indian custody.
Some Pathans, who live in north-western Pakistan and Afghanistan, have
joined Kashmiri Moslems in their rebellion against Indian rule in Kashmir,
where most of the population are Moslems. Thousands of people, including
many civilians, have died in fighting over the past four years.
The Foreign Office, which was last night monitoring the situation, said the
British High Commission in Delhi was planning to send an official to
Srinagar.
Mr Housego left the FT in 1992 to establish a Delhi-based textile
manufacturing and export business.

FT  08 JUN 94 / S Korean police on alert for terrorist attack
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
South Korean police forces yesterday were placed on emergency alert to guard
against possible terrorist attacks in connection with the North Korean
nuclear dispute.
The new alert came as the International Atomic Energy Agency said yesterday
the truth may never be known about the intention of North Korea's nuclear
programme, and stressed that its inspectors must have access to nuclear
waste sites.
Some analysts believe the most likely response by North Korea to threatened
UN sanctions could be terrorist activity in South Korea and Japan, rather
than a conventional military attack.
The police are increasing surveillance of air terminals and ports to prevent
infiltration by North Korean saboteurs and spies, while bolstering security
at government buildings and foreign embassies in Seoul.
South Korean president Kim Young-sam today will convene the first meeting of
the national security council - which consists of senior government
ministers - since he took office 16 months ago. The council will discuss the
military situation on the Korean peninsula and preparations for a possible
conflict.
The government will also seek support for sanctions from the main opposition
Democratic party, which fears that punitive measures against the North could
trigger a war.
Mr Kim yesterday warned that North Korea faces international isolation and
eventual destruction if it persists in developing nuclear weapons.
Senior US and Japanese officials will meet Mr Han Sung-joo, South Korean
foreign minister, on Saturday in Seoul to discuss co-ordinated actions on
implementing proposed UN sanctions against the North.
The visiting officials include Mr Koji Kakizawa, Japanese foreign minister,
and Mr Peter Tarnoff, US undersecretary of state for political affairs.
The UN Security Council is unlikely to consider a sanctions resolution until
next week at the earliest. The US is still consulting with other permanent
members of the Security Council and no draft resolution has yet been
circulated or distributed.
The US, Japan and South Korea support the immediate introduction of limited
sanctions that would gradually escalate in their severity.
But in an effort to win Chinese support they may propose an interim UN
resolution instead that gives North Korea a final deadline to open its
nuclear facilities to full international inspections and avoid sanctions.
Mr Han, who has been holding consultations at the UN, expressed confidence
that China would eventually support some form of sanctions if North Korea
continued to refuse inspections.
But North Korea is also bidding for Chinese support. General Choe Gwang, the
chief of the general staff of the North Korean people's army, is holding
talks with his Chinese counterparts during a week-long visit to Beijing that
began on Monday.
It is the first visit to China in five years by General Choe, the
second-ranking officer in the North Korean military.

FT  08 JUN 94 / Japan's planners upgrade outlook
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Japanese government's Economic Planning Agency yesterday slightly
upgraded its outlook, saying the economy remained stagnant overall but
showed emerging bright spots.
The agency's change in tone in its latest monthly report comes a day after
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development upgraded its
forecast for the Japanese economy, from 0.5 per cent to a still weak 0.8 per
cent growth in gross domestic product this year. Last month, the EPA said
the economy was sluggish, in a record 37 months of decline.
The OECD and EPA changes reflect the gradual impact of previous governments'
four economic stimulation packages, worth Y45,000bn (Pounds 286bn) over 18
months.
The EPA highlighted a smaller-than-expected fall in industrial production in
May as a bright sign. 'It is too early technically to declare the economy
has reached bottom, but my impression is that it has,' said Mr Yoshio
Terasawa, EPA director-general.
This latest EPA survey adds weight to market expectations that the Bank of
Japan's Tankan quarterly study of business confidence, the country's most
authoritative indicator of the short-term economic outlook due out on
Friday, will show a broad improvement.
Recently, the EPA has used more pessimistic language to describe the
economic outlook than most private-sector forecasters, yet at the same time
stuck to an official forecast of 2.4 per cent GDP growth this year, seen by
most private-sector economists as unachievable.
But Mr Hirohisa Fujii, finance minister, said yesterday the government had
to seek to hit the official target by passing this year's budget and
implementing steps to stimulate demand, such as the one-year income tax cut
agreed by the last government.
The budget for the year starting in April, delayed by Japan's internal
political wranglings, is expected to clear parliament this month.
New stimulus packages or monetary measures will be unnecessary, so long as
the budget is passed, said Mr Masaru Hayami, head of the Japan Association
of Corporate Executives. Corporate performance should improve by autumn, in
line with market forecasts that profits will pick up gently this year, after
a four-year decline.

FT  08 JUN 94 / Cheap flowers grow out of the long recession: Japanese are
increasingly price conscious
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On any typical Sunday, a strip along Route 246 just south of the Tama river
is lined with cars blocking the traffic heading out of Tokyo to the
countryside.
The congestion is caused by shoppers who come to World Flower, a discount
flower shop, in search of potted lilies, roses and orchids which are sold at
50-80 per cent discounts on retail prices seen in the countless, independent
flower shops throughout the country.
Back north across the river, a men's apparel shop advertises T-shirts for
Y490 (Pounds 3.12), one-tenth the price at a posh Tokyo department store.
Gone are the days when high prices were assumed to equate with better
quality and stores competed to flaunt extravagance. Instead, value-for-money
is what today's consumers look for; bargain-hunting has become acceptable.
'Consumers have become very sensitive to prices, there is no doubt about
that,' says Mr Hideaki Yajima at Jusco, a leading supermarket operator.
The Japanese media is calling it a revolution in values, as consumers
discover for the first time that the high prices of goods, many of which
have long been fixed across the nation, can actually fall as a result of
market forces.
While the greater price-consciousness has its roots in the country's long
recession, it has been sanctioned by recent government pronouncements on the
need to bring down Japan's high consumer prices.
Earlier this week, Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata pointed to the huge
differentials between prices in Japan and other industrialised countries,
and called for government action to reduce the disparity by half, mainly by
deregulating markets and improving access to imports.
His stance echoes Japanese government policy in the mid-1980s when foreign
pressure on Japan to reduce its current-account surplus by stimulating the
domestic economy led to similar railing against Japan's high prices and
calls for deregulation and market-opening steps. But this time, developments
in the market place and social changes are making it likely the trend
towards lower prices will run deeper and wider than before.
Apart from the large number of discounters sprouting throughout Japan,
supermarkets are going all out to cut prices to remain competitive. They are
developing their own-brands and relying more on imports, often cheaper than
domestic products.
The spread of low-priced imported goods has hit the prices of domestic
goods. The popularity of low-priced imported beer has been a factor behind a
recent price-war involving domestic beer, formerly sold at the same price
everywhere in the country.
Aggressive price-cutting by retailers has more than wiped out a recent rise
in the beer tax and Jusco says beer sales went up 30-50 per cent last month
as a result.
A survey by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry shows the
prices of many goods are actually lower than conventional retail price
figures would suggest, as a result of widespread price cuts and the growing
availability of low-priced goods.
At the same time, consumer perceptions about what constitutes a reasonable
price for products have changed dramatically since the bubble years when
people thought nothing of paying Y1,000 for a 100-gramme steak or a bouquet
of three roses. Spreading awareness among the Japanese public that cheaper
imported goods are just as good as those made at home has helped change
views of how much certain goods should cost.
With a record number of Japanese travelling abroad, there is also a wider
familiarity with overseas prices and a greater reluctance to pay more for
the same goods at home. Another development likely to ensure the trend for
lower prices sticks is the change seen among Japanese manufacturers.
Japanese brewers are tying up with foreign partners in a bid to lower their
costs. Hitachi, the electronics company, is considering launching a range of
low-price consumer electronics with simpler functions, allowing the company
to reduce costs.
Car makers such as Toyota are also launching value-for-money cars which have
trimmed the fancy gadgets to reduce costs. 'Lower prices are no longer just
a passing trend,' asserts Mr Yajima. 'They are common sense.'

FT  08 JUN 94 / OECD Unemployment Report: Rejecting the unthinkable and the
unacceptable - An earlier version of this year's OECD report linked
long-term joblessness with the rise in crime and drugs abuse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The OECD jobs study is like a Rorschach ink blot, in which different people
see different things, says Mr Robert Reich, the US labour secretary.
Mr Reich was responding to questions about whether the political tone of the
document had changed since its earlier, January, draft. The US labour
secretary believes it has not changed significantly but, from long
experience of OECD reports, he knows that there is something in it for
everyone.
The OECD has always been a strongly pro-market organisation but it is broad
enough to reflect a spectrum from relatively interventionist social market
ideas to purer free market ones.
This report has certainly been through various mutations. Last year, at the
instigation of Mr Jean-Claude Paye, the OECD secretary-general, OECD
economists were invited to 'think the unthinkable' about whether
unemployment could be reduced by fiscal expansion, protectionism or even
reducing the pace of technological change.
Not surprisingly, such approaches were rejected. And the final drafts have
emphasised the 'middle-way' - combining labour market flexibility with
efficient welfare to work measures and improved training - which forms the
new consensus running through the Detroit Jobs Summit earlier this year, Mr
Jacques Delors' European Union white paper of last December, and even the
recent Mais lecture by Mr Kenneth Clarke, UK chancellor.
There have been a few minor changes in the past few months. The January
draft explicitly linked long-term unemployment to rising levels of crime and
drug abuse and also called for higher taxation on capital to off-set
reductions in non-wage labour costs. Neither point has found its way into
the final draft.
On the other hand the scepticism towards levies on employers to generate a
higher level of training has also disappeared and training levies are listed
as one of the possible routes to a better trained workforce.
There is certainly plenty for the UK government, towards the free market end
of the spectrum, to welcome in both the January draft and the final version.
The micro-economic stress on flexibility - with qualified hostility towards
strong employment protection legislation and minimum wages, and a relatively
draconian approach to unemployment benefit - fits with the government's
de-regulatory approach.
The UK's Family Credit benefit for the working poor is also explicitly
praised and the passage on public employment services could have been
written in the UK's department of employment.
One other aspect of policy singled out by the OECD - low non-wage labour
costs - is something which the Conservative government cannot claim credit
for as Britain has always paid for welfare through general taxation rather
than through pay-roll taxes.
And UK government economists did have some worries particularly on the
vagueness about who pays for the ambitious training plans and about the idea
that employers should pay something toward the cost of lay-offs.
Those closer to the social market end of the spectrum - including most trade
union centres, left of centre political parties and the EU - welcome the
stress on social consensus, lifetime training, and the critique of the
social consequences of the US labour market model.
Mr John Morley, head of the employment task force at the European Union,
said: 'The OECD places a slightly different stress but the basic message is
very similar to that of the Delors white paper. Both documents stress that
there are disadvantages and advantages in all models, policy is about
steering a path through these things.'
But Mr Morley, in an implicit criticism of the UK government, adds: 'The
real challenge is to avoid the burden of job creation being borne only by
those in the weakest position in society.' He believes that the OECD report,
with its stress on avoiding social exclusion, will help in that cause. The
study certainly stresses that labour market dynamism must be combined with
social objectives but they must be designed in ways that do not have
job-killing side effects.
The danger for the OECD in being all things to all men is that governments
and lobby groups will simply pick out what they want in order to reinforce
what they are already doing.

FT  08 JUN 94 / OECD Unemployment Report: Risk to democracy and world
trading system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has
laboured hard for two years to produce its jobs report.
And the document that was presented to the press and public yesterday is
just the tip of the iceberg of its efforts. Some 50 pages long, it makes a
deliberate attempt to avoid economic jargon. Perhaps because of this, it
goes some way to making clear just how dangerous and damaging the current
high levels of joblessness are in the industrialised nations.
The organisation says that 35m unemployed in the 24 nations covered in the
report 'represents an enormous waste of human resources, reflects an
important amount of inefficiency in economic systems and causes a disturbing
degree of social distress.'
Underemployment in the form of involuntary part-time work, short time
working and the discouragement of job seekers from looking for new
employment could add 40 to 50 per cent to the jobless total.
'Today's unemployment is causing damage in ways that cannot be measured by
the sheer numbers,' the report says. 'It brings with it unravelling of the
social fabric, including a loss of authority of the democratic system and it
risks resulting in the disintegration of the international trading system.'
Although the report ducks the issue of a link between unemployment and
crime, it notes that unemployment is associated with health problems, lowers
self esteem, is demotivating and creates insecurity and resistance to
organisational and technical change.
The central problem, according to the OECD, is an insufficient capacity
among the industrialised nations to adapt to change. This must be rectified
if the OECD member countries are to overcome the jobless problem.
The study makes clear that Europe's weak employment growth but high
productivity and the US experience of creating large numbers of low skilled,
low productivity jobs over the past two decades are two sides of the same
coin. Neither pattern of job creation is desirable. Only Japan has adjusted
relatively well to such changes as globalisation and the spread of new
technologies but it too is now having to deal with substantial problems.
The OECD stresses that Europe faces a much more difficult task than the US
or Japan.
Europe has to deal with rigid labour markets, a failure to encourage
entrepreneurship and private sector jobs, and social security systems that
in many cases hamper the creation of new jobs.
Most European countries also have a poor record in the high-tech industries.
Although Germany and Sweden, along with Japan, are considered leaders on the
use of information technologies for advanced manufacturing, most European
countries have failed to increase the share of production and exports taken
by high tech products. On this score, Japan has been well ahead, creating a
4 per cent increase in manufacturing employment in the 1970s and 1980s. US
manufacturing employment increased 1.5 per cent over the same period while
in the European Union countries it fell by a fifth.
At first sight, the UK appears to have boosted its comparative advantage in
high tech products But this reflected a fall in Britain's market share for
low and medium tech products in the 1980s and not growth in its sales of
high tech products.
The importance of adapting to new technologies explains why there is great
emphasis on improving skills and life-time learning in the OECD's long list
of policy recommendations. In this way, people can adapt to six or more job
changes in a working life.
The report sets out to slay some misconceptions and the idea that there are
any quick fixes. There is no evidence that technological change is
destroying jobs. The idea of 'jobless growth', popular a couple of years
ago, seems wrong. It also takes issue with the idea that imports from low
wage countries in Asia are responsible for much of today's unemployment. 'In
practice, most of the competition in OECD countries comes not from low-wage
countries but from the OECD countries themselves.'
The OECD's message is that change will have to be promoted throughout its
member economies and societies to overcome unemployment. There can be no
taboo areas: social security systems and labour markets and some cherished
rights will have to come under review.
The report notes at one point that: 'To many, change is wrenching.' But in
his introduction, Mr Jean-Claude Paye, the OECD secretary general, observes
that trying to slow the pace of change 'would only make delayed adjustment
more painful'.

FT  08 JUN 94 / OECD Unemployment Report: A 60 point strategy for putting
people back to work
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The OECD's jobs study has one unambiguous message: that high unemployment
can only be tackled by restoring the capacity of economies and societies to
adapt to change.
In trying to turn this goal into a practical strategy, the Paris-based
organisation has produced around 60 specific recommendations. It has set out
to design policies that encourage people to work and keep to a minimum the
number of people who will have to rely wholly on the dole.
Not all policy ideas apply in equal measure to all countries. Most are
addressed to governments, but the OECD says that in many cases action to
increase employment lies with employers, trade unions and individual
workers.
The OECD recognises that most governments are strapped for cash. In calling
for appropriate macro-economic policies, it urges them to cut budget
deficits and improve the quality of public spending.
To promote jobs growth, this means shifting resources from subsidising
existing companies to encouraging new start-ups and moving from income
support for unemployed to 'active labour market measures' to get them back
to work.
The specific recommendations on structural policy are given below in
slightly condensed form and grouped under eight broad headings used by the
OECD:
To enhance the creation and diffusion of technological know-how:
Invest in the creation of new knowledge through basic scientific research
and help companies gain access to such knowledge.
Promote and strengthen mechanisms for international co-operation to gain
economies of scale and avoid duplication of R&amp;D.
Reduce uncertainties that impair the creation and diffusion of new
technologies. Measures could include promoting multilateral agreements on
intellectual property rights and standards, introducing transparent rules on
government support for strategic technologies and ensuring a sound legal
framework for spreading know-how.
Ease the absorption of new technologies in companies through, for example,
making better use of public procurement and removing regulatory barriers to
new information infrastructures.
To increase working time flexibility:
Remove obstacles in labour legislation that impede flexible working time
arrangements.
Extend part-time work to the public sector.
Move from the household to the individual as the base for income tax.
Reduce or remove 'non-neutral' fiscal incentives to early retirement of
workers.
Realign policies to give older workers more opportunities to stay in work.
To nurture an entrepreneurial climate:
Lower start up costs and simplify compliance rules to boost new company
start-ups.
Help small businesses to grow by improving information and advice on such
matters as business planning, equipment and access to training and R&amp;D.
Identify and cut out unwarranted regulatory impediments to small businesses
gaining access to credit.
To increase wage and labour cost flexibility:
Reassess the role of statutory minimum wages as a method of redistributing
incomes. If countries decide to keep a legal minimum wage to combat poverty,
they should index it to prices rather than average earnings and ensure
sufficient differentiation of wage rates by area and region to prevent
minimum wages hitting youth employment or jobs in low productivity areas.
Reduce non-wage labour costs, especially in Europe, by cutting taxes on
labour.
Reduce or remove provisions in the structure of tax and social security
contributions that discourage hiring or part-time employment.
Reduce direct taxes on the low-paid where this would boost demand for
workers, while protecting their incomes.
Refocus, as a medium-term measure, collective bargaining to cover framework
agreements that would leave employers free to respond flexibly to market
trends.
Introduce 'opening clauses' that would allow collective agreements covering
many workers to be renegotiated a lower level.
Increase competition in product markets through such means as deregulation
and privatisation.
To reform employment security provisions:
Prevent dismissals on unfair grounds but allow firings if needed on economic
grounds.
Loosen mandatory restrictions on dismissals in countries (such as Spain)
where they hinder new hiring.
Allow fixed-term contracts but keep the mandatory protection for such
contracts relatively light.
To expand and enhance active labour market policies:
Improve public employment services by integrating placement and counselling,
unemployment benefit payments and management of labour market programmes.
Ensure benefit claimants stay in regular contact with employment service and
eliminate employment service monopolies.
Maintain training for the jobless in economic downturns, but target training
programmes in line with labour market needs.
Allow the labour market authorities to buy and sell training places for the
unemployed and involve employers in design and execution of training
programmes.
Target job creation measures at groups where unemployment could do great
harm, such as long-term unemployed youths. Measures could include special
employment subsidies for high unemployment groups. But pay on job-creation
programmes should be low and training linked to temporary employment
programmes in the public sector.
To improve labour force skills:
Improve initial education. Measures could include provision of pre-school
training for those from disadvantaged backgrounds, measures to reduce early
school-leaving, greater involvement of parents in schools and better
incentives to motivate teachers.
Improve school-to-work transition. Measures could include greater
partnership between industry and schools, new forms of apprenticeship, new
national skill standards, effective career guidance at school, a better
balance between academic and technical and vocational studies and a
'training wage' low enough to encourage companies to offer many training
places.
Improve incentives for companies and workers to invest in continued
learning. Measures could include training credits for adult workers or
accountancy changes that would make the value of skills clear to companies
and workers.
To reform unemployment and related benefit systems.
Restrict unemployment insurance benefit entitlements in countries where
these last a long time, to the period of intense job search.
Reduce the amount of dole where it is high relative to a claimant's previous
post-tax income.
Restrict benefits of indefinite duration for employable people.
Limit support for collective short-time working to companies in temporary
difficulty.
Adjust benefits to ensure low-paid workers are better off when in work, that
spouses of the unemployed have an incentive to take part-time work, and that
long-term unemployed only receive benefit if they take part in 'active
labour market programmes'.
Improve information about claimants available to the employment services.
Make employers pay some of the cost of lay offs.
Attack benefit fraud.
Keep a local financing element in assistance benefits to discourage the view
that benefits are costless to the local economy.

FT  08 JUN 94 / OECD Unemployment Report: Farm subsidies remain in place
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Agricultural subsidies in the industrialised world barely declined last year
in spite of government pledges to reduce them, the OECD reported yesterday.
In its latest annual review of agricultural policies and trade, the OECD
estimated that combined transfers to agriculture from consumers and tax
payers in its member countries fell by less than 1 per cent to just over
Dollars 335bn last year compared with 1992.
The OECD said the reform of agricultural policies in its member countries
had been 'limited and uneven'.
Total farm support increased last year in the US, the European Union and
Turkey and was little changed in Finland, New Zealand and Switzerland. Farm
support, measured in national currencies, fell elsewhere in the OECD.

An unexpected growth in imports halted the improvement in the current
account of Spain's balance of payments in April. The monthly shortfall was
marginally higher than the previous April at Pta222bn despite a sharp rise
in income from tourism and other services. But the accumulated deficit for
the first four months was still 30 per cent lower than the same period last
year at Pta378bn (Pounds 1.82bn), according to provisional Bank of Spain
figures. This reflected a 39 per cent upsurge in exports and an increased
surplus from services and transfers. Tourists receipts were 20 per cent up.
Some analysts believe that despite the latest figures this year could still
produce a current account surplus, the first since 1986, the year of Spain's
accession to the EU. Spain's gold and foreign currency reserves meanwhile
decreased by Dollars 394m in May to Dollars 44.3bn, showing a total decline
of Dollars 933m since the beginning of the year. David White, Madrid
Italy's retail sales index was up 3.4 per cent in February from a year
earlier the state statistical institute, Istat, reported yesterday. In
February, large retail chains registered a 3.8 per cent sales rise, while
medium-sized retailers posted an increase of 1.6 per cent. Associated Press,

New car sales in Spain rose by 31.6 per cent year-on-year in May to 87,712
vehicles, after a 7.2 per cent increase in April, according to provisional
figures from the vehicle manufacturers association ANFAC.
Dutch consumer price inflation is expected to have remained stable at a
year-on-year rate of 2.8 percent in May, according to a poll of bank
economists.

Tensions between Ukraine and its Russian dominated region of Crimea eased
further yesterday when Kiev announced it would pursue a policy of flexible
deadlines in response to Crimea's diplomatic concessions last weekend. Head
of the Ukrainian negotiating team, Mr Volodymyr Bthutkevich, said that any
actions against Crimea's pro-Russian leadership would be postponed until
June 15, a date which could further delayed if negotiations continue to
proceed productively. The initial breakthrough was achieved late Friday
night when Crimean negotiators, many of whom have advocated independence
from Ukraine and reunification with Russia in the past, surprisingly backed
down and signed a pro-Ukrainian communique.
In the communique, Crimea recognizes 'the territorial integrity of Ukraine,
of which Crimea is a part' and 'the supremacy of the Ukrainian Constitution
over all Ukrainian territory.' The two sides, meeting on the Crimean
peninsula, also decided to form a permanent joint working group to resolve
their legislative differences.

Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian premier and owner of the Fininvest media
empire, last night sparked a row by attacking the political coverage of RAI,
the state broadcasting corporation. Twice during the day at different press
conferences, Mr Berlusconi accused RAI of political bias and went on to
criticise the organisation's disastrous. 'I think there is no country in the
world with a democratic government and with public service broadcasting
where the editorial line pursued is antagonistic to the government and the
majority of the country,' he said. He said the situation was anomalous and
needed to be studied with 'much care'.
When challenged about his own ownership of three commercial television
stations, he admitted that too was anomalous but insisted he had distanced
himself from his Fininvest empire. He also claimed to have opinion polls
demomstrating the public felt RAI was biased against his government but
declined to produce the evidence.

Jost Schmiedeskamp, chief prosecutor in the German town of Bielefeld, said
all four board members of Balsam were suspected of gaining credits on the
basis of fake data relating to foreign orders. The fraud was believed to
amount to DM1.6bn (Pounds 640m) The management board is accused of using the
cash from the credits to speculate on foreign exchange markets. Building
projects had been valued at up to 60 times their effective worth, according
to prosecutors. Balsam employs 1,500 employees world-wide in around 30

British Airways is planning to challenge the French government in the
European Commission in Brussels as well as through the French courts if it
goes ahead with proposals to limit the size of aircraft and flight
frequencies on services from London to Orly airport in Paris. Although BA
will start operating services from London Heathrow to Orly on Monday, Sir
Colin Marshall, BA's chairman, yesterday said that the proposed restrictions
at Orly were 'illegal' and would be challenged by BA. France bowed to
European Commission and British government pressure last month to open Orly
to UK airline competition. But Mr Bernard Bosson, the French transport
minister, said UK airlines would be restricted to four flights a day and
that only larger aircraft with more than 200 seats could use Orly at peak
morning and evening hours. He also said that BA and its French affiliate,
TAT, would be regarded as one airline in terms of frequencies. Although BA
intends to fly only four daily services to Orly this summer, it plans to
operate extra flights this winter in defiance of the French proposal to
limit frequencies from London.
Sir Colin also said BA would soon file an objection with the European
Commission to French government plans to inject FFr20bn (Pounds 2.33bn) in
additional state aid to Air France.

FT  08 JUN 94 / Spain joins drive for EU 'great leap forward'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Spain will join France and Germany in a co-ordinated drive in the European
Union over the next 18 months to ensure that the 1996 conference on
institutional reform - the follow-up conference to Maastricht - takes
further clear steps towards European integration.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, and Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez of
Spain, both passionate believers in the process of European unification,
committed themselves at their summit in Schwerin, in east Germany, yesterday
to close co-operation in the planning process for the next European 'great
leap forward'.
Spain will also be involved with France and Germany in carrying through a
clear programme of EU priorities during their three consecutive six-month
presidencies, beginning with Germany on July 1. That will include
European-wide policies to tackle unemployment, measures to support the
emerging democracies of central and eastern Europe, and a programme of
assistance to the countries of northern Africa.
In spite of differences of detail on questions such as the German initiative
for deregulation in the EU, and the borrowing powers of the European
Commission, the German Christian Democrat and the Spanish Socialist leaders
both stressed the overriding need to give impetus to the ideal of a united
Europe in the wake of post-Maastricht disillusionment.
In several hours of tete-a-tete talks, the two also sought to agree on a
common slate of candidates for a whole series of top European and
international jobs to be decided in the coming weeks, including the future
president of the European Commission.
'He should be someone who can get things done, and who can persuade everyone
to agree on common action,' Mr Kohl said after a joint press conference in
the Schwerin castle, former home of the grand dukes of Mecklenburg. He
refused flatly to name any names, although he is widely believed to favour
the candidacy of Mr Jean Luc Dehaene, the Belgian premier, against the rival
candidacy of Mr Ruud Lubbers, the former Dutch prime minister.
Mr Gonzalez has previously given public support to Mr Lubbers - before it
became clear that Mr Dehaene was an alternative. He also maintains that the
future commission president should be a former prime minister, which would
rule out the candidacy of Sir Leon Brittan, the senior British commissioner
in Brussels.
There is now speculation in Spanish circles that Mr Gonzalez might switch
his position in exchange for support for Mr Enrique Baron, the former
president of the European parliament, to become the next secretary-general
of the Western European Union.
At their press conference, however, the two leaders insisted that there
would be no public talk on the jobs list - which includes the
secretary-generalships of Nato and the OECD, the European council of
ministers, and the head of the future World Trade Organisation - until a
deal was done at the EU summit in Corfu.
'We both agreed that we would talk intensively with as many colleagues as
possible in order to reach the greatest possible degree of unity on a name,'
Mr Kohl said. 'It would not help to discuss it in public.'

FT  08 JUN 94 / Clinton promises US backing for stronger Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton yesterday appealed to the western allies to stay the
course they had set themselves in trying to bring peace to Bosnia, and
promised US backing for a stronger Europe.
In his first speech to a European parliament, he told the French national
assembly that 'America will remain engaged in Europe and, despite troop
reductions, will keep a strong force here'.
Seeking to dispel traditional French suspicions of US motives, he said that
'America wishes a strong Europe, and Europe should wish a strong America',
and the entire transatlantic alliance benefited when 'America and Europe
stand together'. French MPs gave his speech a standing ovation that seems
likely to reinforce recent improvements in the long-fractious relationship
between Paris and Washington.
On Bosnia, Mr Clinton counselled patience. While 'we must understand that we
do not have total control over events in every nation', it was 'important to
recognise what has been done there'. He paid tribute to France's leading
role in the UN peacekeeping force that had enabled humanitarian aid to get
through.
The US backed yesterday's UN proposal for a four-month ceasefire, and with
Russia's recent 'very positive' diplomatic help hoped-for results.
As the first US president to address the French parliament since President
Woodrow Wilson did so in 1919, Mr Clinton took a broad historical sweep to
contrast how western democracies had initially failed to check fascism in
the 1930s, but had held together in the face of Soviet communism. After the
latter's collapse, 'we have now arrived at this century's third point of
decision'.
'We must set our sights on a strategic star', he said. 'Let that star be the
integration and strengthening of the broader Europe'. He said he had
strongly welcomed the Nato decision in January 'to let Nato assets be used
by the Western European Union' arm of the European Union, which France is
keen to build up.
The spread of market economics was another essential means of integrating
the wider Europe, Mr Clinton said. He appealed to western Europe to open its
markets to goods from the east, because 'if our new friends are not able to
export their goods, they may instead export instability, even against their
own will'.
France has in fact modified its opposition to eastern European imports,
partly in deference to its close ties with Germany a relationship which Mr
Clinton also described as the linchpin of west Europe unity.
More daring was Mr Clinton's praise of the Gatt agreements, before a
parliament that less than 18 months ago unanimously denounced US
agricultural demands in the Uruguay Round negotiations.
'France played an absolutely pivotal role' in the negotiations, the
president said. 'I know it was difficult, I know it required statesmanship,'
he said, but it had now opened the door to economic growth.
Reuter adds: French presidential elections will take place on April 23 and
May 7 next year, Interior Minister Charles Pasqua said yesterday.

<TEXT>
For Helmut Kohl and Felipe Gonzalez, their meeting over the past two days in
the faded splendour of Schwerin, the former capital of the grand dukes of
Mecklenburg in east Germany, had clear symbolic significance, writes Quentin
Peel from Schwerin. It was the first time the German chancellor had held
top-level talks with a fellow government leader in east Germany. But it was
more than that.
The extraordinarily good personal relationship between the two, the Spanish
Socialist and the German Christian Democrat, has flourished precisely
because Mr Gonzalez was the only west European leader who unhesitatingly
supported the German unification. For the German chancellor, where his
colleagues stood on the question of unification has become a touchstone for
personal relations.
It is increasingly clear that the failure of Mr Ruud Lubbers, the former
Netherlands premier, to back the unification process four years ago, is the
most important single reason why Mr Kohl is not supporting him to become the
next president of the European commission in Brussels.
Mr Kohl spelt out his appreciation of Mr Gonzalez' loyalty in glowing terms
again yesterday. He pointed out how few those world leaders were, back in
1989 and 1990, who had been so positive.
In private, he names only four: Mr George Bush, the former US president; Mr
Brian Mulroney, the former Canadian premier; Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, the
former Soviet leader; and Mr Gonzalez.
One significant exception is President Francois Mitterrand of France, who
was clearly dubious about unification until late in the process. But the
Franco-German relationship is too important to allow that to cause more than
a shadow between the two.
The outright opposition of Mrs Margaret Thatcher, who was publicly cool and
privately vitriolic about unification, has caused far more lasting
bitterness.
Mr Kohl mentioned Mrs Thatcher's opposition yesterday, to underline his
appreciation of his Spanish colleague.
'Some women colleagues have written it in their memoirs,' he said. 'If you
read what Mrs Thatcher says, you can see she thinks it was all a terrible
mistake. So you can see how important it was that Felipe Gonzalez supported
the process.
'You belong to those who, in many critical talks, explained again and again
that German unity was not a thing for the Germans alone, but was a good
thing for the Europeans, and for the free world,' he told the Spanish
premier yesterday.

Unions at Air Inter, the main domestic carrier in the Air France group,
yesterday called their second 24-hour strike in three weeks in protest at
the lack of 'concrete' assurances at their pay and job security will not
suffer as a result of new austerity measures for Air France. But the strike,
called also to press Air Inter's case for more autonomy within the Air
France group, was less widespread than the first one, halting about 50 per
cent of flights yesterday. Meanwhile, the French government has warned the
European Commission that if Brussels stops it injecting FFr20bn into Air
France and thereby forces the airline into liquidation, the total cost to
the French taxpayer would be even greater, amounting to FFr30bn. This was
revealed by the Commission in its formal nouncement last Friday of an
inquiry into the Air France deal, which Brussels said in view of the
airline's debts and losses could not be equated with the 'rational' decision
of a private investor.

FT  08 JUN 94 / Austrians in a fever over EU referendum: Not long ago, a Yes
vote seemed assured; now it's far from certain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the European Union, tomatoes must be square, chocolates are made of blood
and cucumbers are all radioactive. These are among the scare stories put
about in Austria in the past couple of weeks as campaigning towards the
country's referendum this Sunday on joining the EU has reached an
extraordinarily fevered pitch.
According to the results of two polls published this week, sentiment has
become finely balanced, with 31 per cent of those who have made up their
minds in favour of joining and the same number opposed. An astonishing 38
per cent are still undecided.
If Austrians decide not to join the EU, Swedes and Norwegians, who vote in
referendums in the autumn, might easily follow, leaving the Union's
expansion strategy in tatters.
Anti-EU sentiment in Austria has recovered dramatically since early March
when the successful conclusion of entry negotiations left the country in a
pro-Europe euphoric state.
Polls then indicated as much as a 25 point lead for the pro-EU campaign.
That momentum was soon dissipated when Britain and Spain held up
ratification of the treaty over the arcane issue of voting weights in the
council of ministers. This was just another demonstration of the meaningless
wrangles that paralyse the Union, anti-EU forces in Austria exulted.
But, until a few days ago, polls continued to show that a small, but
comfortable, majority of Austrians would vote in favour of joining the
Union.
The motley collection of extreme right-wingers, farmers and some leftish
Greens who formed the opposition looked completely overwhelmed by the
unified ranks of the country's political, business and union leaders.
And the fundamental economic and security arguments for joining the EU,
while not inspiring, were difficult to refute. In post cold war Europe, it
is no longer clear who, if anyone, would guarantee Austria's security unless
it becomes part of the Union.
The country's economy is already closely integrated with those of
neighbouring EU countries, especially Germany and Italy. While membership
will not make a big difference in Austria's growth prospects, there is
general agreement that inward investment would be weaker if Austria did not
join.
'We believe that 90 per cent of Austria's workers will benefit from
membership, and the rest will be protected by special measures,' Mr Heinz
Vogler, president of the federal chamber of labour, says.
But these arguments were forgotten when the scare stories started appearing.
Apart from the silly ones mentioned above which appeared in tabloid
newspapers, there have been more substantial ones carefully tailored to
Austrian sensitivities.
One legal expert discovered that, once inside the EU, Austria could not
prevent its neighbouring countries from draining the Austrian Alps for their
water requirements. Mr Jorg Haider, charismatic leader of the extreme
right-wing Austrian Freedom party, promptly put up posters warning that
joining the Union meant the country would lose its water.
Then a constitutional lawyer in Salzburg said that membership of the EU,
including Euratom, would invalidate Austria's law outlawing the construction
and operation of nuclear power plants, in spite of a comforting side letter
in the entry treaty. From there, it was but a short step for EU opponents to
claim that Brussels would force the country to build nuclear plants.
Last week, the Socialist-Conservative coalition government, which is leading
the pro-EU campaign, took fright, realising that the scare campaign was
having an impact. Now the government, too, has become somewhat extravagant
in its claims.
Mr Ferdinand Lacina, finance minister, threatened last week that taxes would
have to be raised if the country stayed outside. On Wednesday, Mr Otto
Habsburg, a descendant of the former Austrian monarchy, was trotted out to
say that the old Austrian idea of bringing people together in peace could
only be realised in the EU.
On Sunday, Mr Alois Mock, the foreign minister who is recovering from a back
operation, rose from his hospital bed to plead emotionally with his
countrymen in a television interview to vote in favour.
He warned that a No vote would greatly weaken Austria. 'We wouldn't go
hungry. Our country is strong. But we would suffer many disadvantages -
above all the next generation.'
Ordinary Austrians seem put off by the increasingly shrill tone of the
campaign, as is shown by the large number of undecided voters even at this
late stage. One Vienna banker said this week: 'One day when I talk to
people, I get the impression that it will go through. The next day, I get
the opposite impression.'

FT  08 JUN 94 / Green putscase for staying on outside: Questions on Europe
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Madeleine Petrovic, leader of the Green Club in Austria, is a law graduate
and former official in the Austrian social affairs ministry. She was elected
president of the Green Alternative in Vienna in 1987 and to the national
parliament in 1990. Q: Austrians vote in a referendum on June 12 on whether
to join the European Union. Why do you oppose Austrian membership of the EU?
A: We are not fundamentally against it. We want to change the EU, especially
the Maastricht treaty. There are differing views among Greens about how best
to do this. Some think we should join and then try to change it from the
inside. We have evidence that it is possible to change the EU from outside.
Accession by Austria would be a good thing only if the Austrian government
were willing to push for change in the EU. The EU is like a big ship that
has sailed into dangerous waters. It needs a mobile little tug boat to get
it out. We would like Austria to play that role. But the present government
will not push for change.
Q: What do you think needs to be changed?
A: EU environmental policy is not strong enough to stop the negative actions
of member states.
Q: Hasn't the EU shown sensitivity to Austrian concerns by agreeing to help
finance a rail tunnel through the Brenner pass?
A: You cannot solve the transit problem with tunnels and bridges. Up to now,
all the technical improvements that have been made have not been enough to
prevent the growth of traffic. We get the impression that the EU does not
see the real issue. The people want traffic to decrease.
Q: The government says the EU has also offered Austrian farmers a reasonable
transition arrangement.
A: EU agricultural policy is completely contrary to the notion of
sustainable development. It is wrong to transfer the multinational
industrial model to agriculture. We should produce locally as much as
possible.
Q: Do you fear economic damage if Austria does not join? A: The economic
effect would be marginal. We are already in the European Economic Area.
Q: What do you think will be the result in the referendum?
A: People do not trust the government. They know it is impossible for the EU
to have only good points. Austrians have a strong tendency to decide in the
day or so before a vote. Of course, we are going to respect the result, but
the government will not if it loses. It will stage a second referendum.
Q: What would be the impact in the EU of a rejection?
A: The EU is in a very fragile state. Its leaders do not see what young
people expect the Union to do. If they took a single step in the right
direction, then young people would be enthusiastic. Now, instead, we have
disaffection and indifference.

FT  08 JUN 94 / EU farmers try to come to terms with the new political
landscape: The industry is deep in debate - and intensely worried - about
the longer-term future of agricultural policy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Mr Jean-Claude Debaudre, a Normandy dairy farmer, will be voting in this
week's European elections to stop a foreign invasion.
'The borders are a sieve. Products like meat are coming into western Europe
from Poland and the Czech Republic without health checks,' says Mr Debaudre,
who is also president of the Normandy farmers' union. 'Sanitary conditions
are very different in eastern Europe and they're putting those in western
Europe at risk. We want real frontiers, on price and safety grounds.'
Low-cost east European producers are not the only targets at which he wants
his MEP to take aim. Currency fluctuations following the breakdown of the
European monetary system have created 'distortions' in competition between
member states, he says.
While British farmers enjoyed a 60 per cent rise in their incomes last year,
prices for French wheat producers dropped by up to a quarter. That is why Mr
Debaudre favours a single currency, or at least tighter regulations.
'Farmers are very concerned about this. We want our candidates to commit
themselves to it.'
Short-term inequities, perceived or real, are high on the agenda at farmers'
meetings with prospective MEPs. In both Britain and Denmark, for example,
producers claim bitterly that they alone stick by the rules, filling in
mountains of forms to comply with increasingly complex farm policies agreed
in Brussels, while competitors elsewhere in the EU cheat and get away with
it.
But the elections also come at a time when the industry is deep in debate -
and intensely worried - about the longer-term future of agricultural policy.
Mr Jens Jakob Jakobsen, a large dairy farmer with 112 cows in Gangsted,
northern Denmark, is arranging a series of farm visits for his local
Euro-candidate, Ms Karen Riis Jorgensen. Farmers on the surrounding hills
are much more interested in the election than people unconnected with the
land, he believes. 'How can we say we don't care when so much of our future
is set in Brussels?'
His neighbours will turn out in force to talk to Ms Jorgensen, but they do
not expect the young lawyer to have all the answers. 'Who can tell what will
happen, even in the next six months? We're all a little uncertain about the
outcome of common agricultural policy reforms and the Gatt,' Mr Jakobsen
explains.
The 1992 reforms of the CAP introduced direct payments to farmers as
compensation for cuts in price support. This made the size of the subsidies
more transparent and highlighted the cost of the CAP, which this year
amounts to Ecu36.5bn (Pounds 28bn), or half the total EU budget. Pressure is
on for further reductions in support when the reforms end in 1996, and
farmers know it.
Many also believe the sharp decline in the agricultural workforce - which
has dropped by 26 per cent in the past decade - has lessened their lobbying
power. Even in member states like Ireland, where nearly 14 per cent of the
labour force is still farm-based, producers are aware they can no longer
take taxpayers' money for granted.
There are strains within the industry. Professor Wyn Grant, a specialist in
agricultural policy at Britain's Warwick University, says that about a third
of EU farmers are efficient enough to feel they could compete if subsidies
were reduced or eliminated. 'The others recognise they would be forced out
of business if subsidies did not continue,' he says.
That split in their constituency helps explain why some farming
organisations have produced European election manifestos demanding
open-ended support from the taxpayer, while others accept the need for
radical reform.
For Mr Sjoerd Miedema, who runs a computerised dairy operation with 60 cows
in Friesland, the Netherlands' main dairying region, the question is: what
kind of reform? Given the high costs he faces to comply with environmental
regulations, he does not want subsidies to be limited to keeping inefficient
producers on marginal farmland. 'You'll get all kinds of farmers doing it as
a hobby,' he says. 'That's not producing real money for the rural economy.'
Mr Liam Foley is also an efficient dairy producer, but he farms in County
Cork and is a senior official in the Irish Farmers' Association. The
priority in Ireland, he says, is to concentrate payments on preventing rural
decline.
He will be voting with one eye on New Zealand, where agricultural subsidies
were withdrawn virtually overnight in 1984. Fear that the Gatt deal
liberalising world trade will eventually force the EU into open competition
with highly efficient, low-cost food exporters is uppermost in many Irish
farmers' minds.
'The large, efficient Irish producer could live with that, but the 35,000
dairy farms in Ireland would quite quickly be reduced to 10,000 in a totally
free market,' he says. 'New Zealand dairy farms have an average herd of 160
cows. The average in Ireland is 25 to 30 cows. The social consequences are
very, very serious for this country.'
He is also worried about the impact on peripheral member states if east
European countries join the EU. 'The Germans are the main contributors to
the EU budget and it will be more beneficial for them to contribute to the
economies of the east,' he says. 'That will mean far less money from the EU
coming into a country like Ireland through structural funds.'
If subsidies are to continue as a way of propping up rural economies, then
Mr Foley expects public pressure to ensure that environmental conditions are
attached to them.
Mr Willy Gorlach, the German agriculture spokesman for the Socialist group
in the last European parliament, argues that support should be targeted at
farmers who adopt less intensive, 'greener' methods.
Standing for re-election, Mr Gorlach attacks the way the current CAP reforms
oblige farmers to leave 15 per cent of their arable land idle as 'set-aside'
while allowing intensive crop-growing to continue on the remaining 85 per
cent. 'It's not just the farmers' task to produce food,' he says. 'People
should recognise that farmers have to produce the landscape, they have to
protect nature, they have to protect our drinking water. As long as prices
for food products fall because of overproduction, we need payments for
farmers so they can respond to society's demands for landscape and nature.'

FT  08 JUN 94 / Exports boost for West Germany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
West Germany's economic recovery started with a surge of more than 2 per
cent real growth in the first quarter after 12 months of sharp decline, the
federal statistics office said yesterday.
The rise was fuelled by strong exports and good weather for building, which
are still helping to damp down unemployment, and a spurt in consumer
spending.
The result showed the economy was on the road to recovery, the office said,
although analysts and industry warned the early pace was unlikely to be
maintained.
Mr Gunter Rexrodt, economics minister, said in Paris that pan-German growth
for the full year might now exceed his forecast of up to 1.5 per cent,
although no dramatic decline in unemployment would occur.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development this week revised
its 1994 German growth forecast from 0.8 per cent to 1.8 per cent. But Mr
Peter Stihl, president of the DIHT trade and industry association, said the
early improvement owed more to optimism than facts.
He expected only a 1 per cent improvement for the year. His caution echoed
warnings from Mr Hans Tietmeyer, Bundesbank president, that the mood was
better than the real situation warranted.
While good economic news may improve the government parties' electoral
chances, employers and the central bank are eager to damp popular
expectations of a rapid recovery which could generate renewed inflationary
pressure. Such a development could prolong the pause in the bank's interest
rate reduction programme, or even lead to rate rises, some economists fear.
German-based observers said real cuts in disposable incomes were now choking
off private demand, public spending was still restrained, and prospects for
the rest of the year depended almost entirely on exports.
GDP in the review period rose a real 2.1 per cent compared with the first
three months of 1993, and was up a seasonally-adjusted 0.5 per cent on the
last quarter of 1993. The figures were enhanced by special factors, but
showed the first positive year-on-year change since the last quarter of
1993, the statistics office said.
Mild weather contributed to 4.7 per cent growth in construction output, and
the pre-Easter shopping rush, which fell in April last year, showed up in a
1.7 per cent rise in private consumption. Exports increased 5.4 per cent and
imports rose 2.7 per cent, while public-sector demand remained 1.2 per cent
below last year's level.
The quarter had one more working day than last year, and after adjustment
for that, real GDP was up 1.6 per cent on the year.
The expansive trend was confirmed by the third consecutive monthly fall in
unemployment in May, taking the headline rate in the west from 8.4 per cent
to 8.1 per cent and from 16.2 per cent to 15.4 per cent in the east.
Seasonally adjusted, numbers without work in the west rose 9,000.
Federal employment officials now expected no more than 3.8m people out of
work at the end of the year, against analysts' earlier forecasts of more
than 4m. The labour market had not improved, but total registered vacancies
rose 3 per cent in May; unfilled jobs in the manufacturing sector increased
13 per cent. they added.

FT  08 JUN 94 / Europe looms small in UK voters' eyes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To the extent one can gauge the prevailing mood of an electorate, British
voters prefer the sceptical vision of Europe offered by Mr John Major's
Conservative government. But they will vote overwhelmingly for the
opposition Labour and Liberal Democrat parties.
Perhaps more so than in any other European Union nation, the domestic record
of the government, rather than the future shape of Europe, will decide the
outcome in tomorrow's European elections.
No-one in the British political establishment doubts that the governing
Conservatives will suffer heavy losses. The question is whether it will be a
defeat or a disaster.
Opinion pollsters' best guess is that by the time the votes are counted on
Sunday evening the party's representation in the Strasbourg assembly will be
cut from the present 32 to anything between six and 20.
Of the total 84 seats in mainland Britain, Labour can expect to win upwards
of 50 and the Liberal Democrats anything from three to a dozen.
The projections are precarious. The past few days have seen signs of a
pick-up in support for the Conservatives. Britain's first-past-the-post
electoral system ensures the winner invariably secures a disproportionate
number of seats.
But it also means that a small swing, as little or 2 or 3 per cent of the
vote, will decide the outcome in many seats.
Whatever the precise figures, Mr Major can credibly argue that the defeat
will be despite, rather than because of, the essentially hostile approach to
further European integration which has been the hallmark of the Conservative
campaign.
Britain has never been a nation of enthusiasts for Europe. But the legacy of
a deep recession and the bitter arguments over the Maastricht treaty have
reinforced instinctive hostility to the idea that the rest of Europe might
know best.
Mr Major's campaign has played to that mood. His emphasis on the
preservation of the national veto in key areas of policy-making and on his
government's opt-outs from the social chapter and monetary union have struck
a chord with a large slice of the electorate.
The idea of a multi-track, multi-speed Europe in which Britain can proceed
at its chosen pace has allowed the Conservatives to paper over the worst
splits in his own party.
Eurosceptics have seized on it as evidence they are winning the argument -
that Britain will opt out of further moves towards integration at the 1996
intergovernmental conference.
The prime minister's rhetoric has provided further succour. The Tory party's
enthusiasts (and there are still many) take comfort from the fact that Mr
Major has given no binding commitments about Britain's stance at that
conference.
Mr Major's problem is that while the style of his campaign, with its
exaggerated claims of a threat to British sovereignty, may solidify the core
Conservative vote, most of the electorate will be more influenced by his
dismal domestic record.
A painfully slow economic recovery, the largest tax increases in recent
memory, and a divided government unable to set a coherent policy agenda, do
not provide the ingredients for electoral success.
The voters are in the mood to punish Mr Major for his broken promises.
Despite the disruption caused by the death last month of its leader, Mr John
Smith, the Labour party has focused its campaigning effort almost entirely
on this domestic agenda, branding the prime minister a weak leader at the
head of a directionless government.
On issues European Labour is now more 'positive' than the Conservatives  -
committed to the social chapter and in favour of, if not enthusiastic about,
a single currency.
However, it has been careful not to shout that fact from the rooftops.
The Liberal Democrats, long the most pro-European of Britain's mainstream
parties, have adopted the same tack. Mr Paddy Ashdown, their leader, has
toned down his commitment to a single currency and promised a referendum if
the 1996 conference leads to a significant shift in sovereignty.
Instead, the Liberal Democrats have concentrated their fire on domestic
issues.
Overall, the result has been a campaign that has denied the voters a
rational debate on Britain's relations with its European partners.
Whoever wins, Europe will be the loser.

FT  08 JUN 94 / Battle for Moscow moves from street to balance sheet: The
mayor's attempt to short-circuit privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Moscow has become the site of a furious battle over privatisation in Russia.
Mr Anatoly Chubais, the privatisation minister, has called on the country's
president and prime minister to 'punish' the mayor of Moscow for
'undermining the foundations of Russian statehood'. He accuses Mayor Yuri
Luzhkov, an old-style manager with a populist touch, of trying to replace
the government's radical privatisation policies with his personal control
over enterprises in the Russian capital.
In three weeks vouchers entitling every Russian citizen to a share of state
property expire. Mr Chubais has launched his assault on Mr Luzhkov before
the next stage of privatisation. From July 1, enterprises will be sold for
money only and Mr Luzhkov wants to make sure that that money ends up in the
city's coffers rather than those of the government.
Moscow is not only important as a showpiece of the government's reform
policies, but the capital is a leading industrial centre in its own right.
Despite claims by Mr Luzhkov that Moscow was among the top privatising
areas, figures from his own office show that it was 20th in a list of 89
regions, having privatised less than half the companies it was supposed to
have sold off under the government's programme.
Mr Luzhkov's 'special' plan for privatisation in Moscow would enable the
mayor's office - and that means the mayor because all important decision in
the city administration are taken by him - to dictate what happens to
enterprises after they are privatised.
This includes instructions that new owners would be entitled only to profits
over and above those made by a company before it was privatised and that
only the mayor's office would be able to decide whether enterprises could be
bankrupted or liquidated.
Mr Luzhkov claims that enterprises auctioned off so far have been sold to
speculators and that the government's ambitious sell-off of half of Russian
industry has not yielded any benefits.
On April 1 Mr Luzhkov suspended the registration of joint-stock companies, a
precondition for their privatisation according to the government's sell-off
method. This has consisted of auctioning off enterprises for vouchers, as
quickly as possibly, in order to get the state out of the economy while
minimising opportunities for corrupt officials to decide who gets what.
At the end of last month, at Mr Chubais' request, Mr Victor Chernomyrdin,
the prime minister, gave Mr Luzhkov a three-day deadline to resume the
registration of joint-stock companies. But on Thursday last week, Mr Luzhkov
suggested that the instructions were not to be taken seriously.
Last month, he suspended land sales in the capital, saying the government
needed land to generate revenues for the city budget.
The main reason Mr Luzhkov has been able to get away with so much is
political. Having been loyal to President Boris Yeltsin in all his conflicts
with the Russian parliament, the mayor of Moscow is seen as an essential
ally for any Kremlin ruler should the country's power struggle ever return
to the streets of the capital.
Nor has Mr Luzhkov hesitated to take his struggle to the streets and to
factory shop-floors. In a direct challenge to the government's policies, he
gave Rbs30bn (Dollars 15m) to 'save' Zil, an ailing Moscow truck
manufacturer which had closed its gates for several weeks. While the
government had proposed that Zil re-organise and use its land holdings to
raise new capital, Mr Luzhkov, who always says the city is too broke to pay
its doctors, teachers, and police properly, found no trouble financing
support for Zil, which happens to be run by an old political rival of Mr
Yeltsin's.
Mr Luzhkov, who rejects suggestions that he plans to run for president in
elections scheduled for 1996, denies that his motives are political. He says
simply that the government must take into account factors that make Moscow
different.

FT  08 JUN 94 / OFT urges extensive reforms of consumer credit laws
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Extensive reforms of the laws affecting consumer credit were proposed
yesterday by Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, in an
effort to relieve the regulatory burdens on business.
The Office of Fair Trading recommended that lending to businesses should be
removed from the scope of the Consumer Credit Act, on the grounds that it is
designed specifically to protect consumers.
Other proposals designed to cut down the red tape on consumer credit include
the simplification of rules for the advertising of credit terms and the
removal of regulations relating to credit and hire quotations.
Sir Bryan said that his proposals were 'in the nature of a spring-clean, not
a wholesale clearing-out of the cupboard'. His starting point was the basis
that the framework of the 1974 Consumer Credit Act was sound, but some rules
were unnecessarily onerous.
However, Sir Bryan said that some existing rules, while reflecting sound
motives, were misleading or unfair. For example, he recommended a
modification of the rules concerning the calculations of Annual Percentage
Rates to enable easier comparisons of credit terms.
Sir Bryan also recommended the immediate implementation of the relevant
section of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990, which would require
lenders to give borrowers more information about packages in which mortgages
are sold in association with tied products, such as insurance. Research by
the OFT, published yesterday, found that 'a sub-stantial proportion' of
con-sumers with tied packages had been dissatisfied with tied products.
Sir Bryan recommended against implementing a proposal made by the government
in 1988, which would have removed the requirement for credit traders to
obtain licences when they started to trade.
The OFT's proposals were cautiously welcomed by lenders. The Council of
Mortgage Lenders said that the overall approach of the OFT appeared to be
'sensible, balanced and achievable'.
But the Consumers' Association said the OFT's proposals to change some of
the information on loan repayment rates provided by lenders 'would weaken
consumer protection and confuse consumers'.
Mr Nigel Griffiths, Labour spokesman on consumer affairs, said he doubted
that the OFT's proposals would help address consumers' confusion.
The proposed reforms, which followed a review of the Consumer Credit Act,
were developed in the context of the government's Deregulation Initiative.

FT  08 JUN 94 / Austria may deliver snub to EU in membership vote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER and HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

<TEXT>
The European Union is threatened with another humiliation as Austrians vote
in a referendum this Sunday on whether to join the Union.
A positive outcome seemed assured only days ago, but the battle has suddenly
become a cliffhanger. The latest opinion polls indicate voters are evenly
split with many still undecided.
As in the Maastricht treaty ratification referendum campaign in Denmark two
years ago, anti-EU forces have won wide public support in the past few days
by conjuring up images of a centralising, bureaucratic government in
Brussels that would ride roughshod over Austrian interests.
Brussels would force Austria to build nuclear power plants against its will
and would allow other EU countries to siphon off water from its Alpine
reservoirs, EU opponents say.
Meanwhile, the pro-EU forces in Austria have been unable to find ways to
paint the Union as an inspiring or effective organisation. For many
Austrians there is evidence of the ineffectiveness of EU foreign policy in
the large flow of refugees from the former Yugoslavia.
Mr Alois Mock, the Austrian foreign minister who has campaigned passionately
for joining, admitted yesterday that the vote would be close.
Mr Franz Vranitzky, the chancellor, was slightly more optimistic, saying he
expected a clear and unambiguous vote, but acknowledging that it would 'not
be an overwhelming result'.
A rejection of the EU would be another snub for the centralising tendency of
the Union that has been the hallmark of the presidency of Mr Jacques Delors.
Such a snub would be magnified if a negative vote in Austria encouraged
voters in Finland, Norway and Sweden, who face EU entry referendums in the
autumn, to follow suit. The governments of Finland, Norway and Sweden have
all watched the crumbling opinion poll lead of the pro-EU campaign in
Austria with a mounting sense of alarm.
With the opposition to the EU holding a solid lead in the opinion polls in
Sweden and reaching 56 per cent - the highest level this year - in Norway
this week, prime minister Mr Carl Bildt's right-centre coalition in
Stockholm and Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland's minority Labour government in Oslo
badly need an Austrian Yes to keep their campaigns on an even keel.
In Finland, polls suggest most voters are in favour of joining the EU. But
prime minister Mr Esko Aho's centre-conservative coalition is troubled by an
internal EU-related row, which might be exacerbated after an Austrian
rejection.

FT  08 JUN 94 / US group in talks on global telecoms link-up: French and
German companies may take stakes in Sprint
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON and ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sprint, the large US telecom-munications group, confirmed yesterday that it
was discussing a global partnership with France Telecom and Deutsche
Telekom, both of which might take equity stakes in the company.
Deutsche Telekom confirmed the talks and said it would make an announcement
within the next few days.
A deal would constitute the second significant US-European telecoms
alliance, coming a year after the launch of a Dollars 5.3bn (Pounds 3.53bn)
tie-up between British Telecommunications and MCI, the second largest US
operator.
Leading international telecoms operators are all attempting to position
themselves as service providers to multinational companies amid rapid growth
in global communications traffic.
If the deal goes ahead, analysts expect AT&amp;T, the largest US operator, to
renew its efforts to forge a European partnership to bolster its
'Worldsource' venture, launched last year.
Sprint's announcement came 24 hours after the company said it had terminated
talks about a full merger with Electronic Data Systems, the computing
services subsidiary of General Motors, although the two said they would
continue to discuss some form of alliance.
Sprint is the third largest long-distance and international carrier in the
US, with a market share of just under 10 per cent. It also has large local
and cellular telephony interests and earned Dollars 480.6m from continuing
operations last year on revenues of Dollars 11.4bn.
It said the proposed partnership with the European companies would
concentrate mainly on providing 'seamless, global telecommunications
services to business customers'.
France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom signed an Ecu1bn (Pounds 770m) alliance
last December, geared particularly at the international data market. It has
been actively seeking a US partner over the past year and is known to have
been in talks with AT&amp;T.
The talks envisaged France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom making minority
equity investments in Sprint through purchases of a new class of Sprint
stock at a premium.
The company declined to elaborate on the potential size of the investment,
but analysts speculated that it might involve several billion dollars.
Shares in Sprint, which has a market capitalisation of more than Dollars
13bn, rose Dollars 1 3/8 to close at Dollars 39 3/8 in New York yesterday.
The final form of any deal would remain problematic until the future status
of the French and German operators is determined. Deutsche Telekom is in the
throes of an uncertain privatisation process, and the French government has
yet to decide whether to proceed with privatisation of France Telecom.
Unless both companies move to the private sector, it may not be possible to
exchange equity stakes.

FT  08 JUN 94 / Leading nations back OECD plan to reduce jobless: Call to
reassess statutory minimum wage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ministers from the world's 25 leading industrialised nations yesterday
backed a wide programme of policies aimed at reducing the ranks of the 35m
unemployed in their countries.
The ministers, in Paris for the annual meeting of the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development, endorsed an OECD report containing
more than 60 recommendations ranging from encouraging entrepreneurship to
changing laws that discourage hiring of labour.
The organisation also calls on governments to 'reassess the role of
statutory minimum wages' as an instrument for redistributing earnings.
The measures will be used by individual OECD member states to fashion
tailor-made policy programmes, to be implemented with the help of the
Paris-based organisation. Mr Bertie Ahern, the Irish finance minister who
chaired yesterday's meeting, said there was 'a strong desire among ministers
to undertake the policy options outlined'.
Emphasis was placed on improving training and education programmes. 'With
the change in labour markets, you are an apprentice all your life,' Mr Ahern
said.
The decision to launch an international employment strategy reflects the
realisation that the industrial world's recovery from recession will not be
sufficient to bring back the high levels of employment that existed in the
1950s and 1960s.
A communique issued after the meeting noted that the ministers had agreed to
embrace change. Technical advances and the expansion of trade and investment
'create vast new opportunities for the OECD countries to expand employment',
it said.
That, though, required the industrialised countries 'to be permanently
innovative and able to adjust, constantly improving their economic
efficiency'. To reduce unemployment, the ministers agreed that comprehensive
reforms of their labour markets and other structural reforms were essential.
They pledged their countries to:
Nurture entrepreneurship;
Ease regulations that discourage private initiative;
Improve education and training systems;
Improve the functioning of labour markets to achieve a better match between
the supply and demand for jobs; Make employment services more effective,
giving high priority to 'active labour market policies' designed to put
people in touch with jobs;
Change laws and regulations that discourage hiring of labour.
At the same time, the ministers agreed that the industrial countries should
maintain 'an adequate social safety net' for those who could not adapt to
change.
Mr Ahern insisted that the OECD countries were 'not talking about
unravelling the welfare system, taking away the basic rights of workers or
undermining long-standing collective agreements'.
However, the organisation proposes strict guidelines to prevent unemployment
benefits acting as a disincentive to work. It also suggests that over the
medium term, collective bargaining agreements should be made more flexible
to give employers a chance to renegotiate terms in times of difficulty.
The report acknowledges that the industrial world will continue to create
low-wage, low-skilled jobs. But it underlines the importance of training as
a way of enabling people to cope with technological change and increased
competition.
Recognising that the US was creating too many low-paid jobs, Mr Robert
Reich, the US labour secretary, said it would be impossible to increase
productivity 'without a substantial investment in training and learning'.

FT  08 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Great Portland plans 20% dividend cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Great Portland Estates, a leading property company which has diversified
from its traditional central London base in recent years, plans to cut its
dividend for the first time in its 35-year history, writes Vanessa Houlder.
A recommended final payment of 5.3p will make a total of 8p against 9.7p a
year earlier. The 20 per cent cut had been flagged previously and the shares
closed down only 7p at 196p.
The cut was proposed because the redevelopment of one property and sale of
others had caused a Pounds 6m reduction in gross rental income. Overall,
rental income was flat at Pounds 87.3m.
The company said, however, it was likely to increase the dividend again in
the current year.
Pre-tax profits for the year to March fell to Pounds 25.4m from Pounds
34.04m a year earlier but would have been flat but for a Pounds 9.7m charge
for renegotiating a syndicated loan and associated swap arrangement.
Earnings per share after the charge and a higher tax rate fell to 5.5p from
11.3p adjusted for last June's rights issue.
Net asset value rose 21 per cent from 172p to 209p. The reported asset value
was below most analysts' forecasts. County NatWest, brokers, said it
expected Great Portland to post a net asset value of 240p next year. It
expected the dividend to rise by 10 per cent to 8.8p.
The company's investment portfolio was valued at March 31 at Pounds 1.04bn,
representing after capital expenditure, an increase of 14 per cent and a
running yield of 8.75 per cent.
In the latest year, central London accounted for 57 per cent of the
portfolio against 84 per cent in 1989, and retail space for 33 per cent (13
per cent).
Generation of increased earnings, and thereby dividends, remains one of the
group's top priorities, said Mr Richard Peskin, chairman.

Axel Springer, publisher of the German title Die Welt and the mass
circulation Bild daily, yesterday reported a rise in profits for 1993,
writes Judy Dempsey in Berlin.
Group profits rose from DM57.2m in 1992 to DM71.4m (Dollars 42.2m).
However, turnover dipped by 1 per cent to DM3.44bn. This was partly blamed
on a 4 per cent fall in advertising revenue, to DM1.52bn. Sales to eastern
Germany also weakened. Overall, total newspaper turnover rose 2.8 per cent
to DM1.06bn.
The company invested DM229.9m, compared with DM409.8m the previous year,
when it was acquiring new titles. Last year, it also introduced a
restructuring programme aimed at cutting costs.

FT  08 JUN 94 / Information highway comes to a crossroads: Paul Cheeseright
catches up on a Herefordshire experiment in local computing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An experiment in stimulating rural economic development by providing a
community with a package of the latest computer and communications
technology has reached a crossroads.
In the next two weeks, sponsors and local interests running the scheme at
Kington, Herefordshire, will decide the extent to which the project should
become a moneymaking exercise and the extent to which it will meet, often
unorganised, community demands.
What is clear is the idea that simply installing more than Pounds 250,000 of
electronic equipment in the community would itself stimulate rapid economic
development has been disproved.
Decisions over the future of Kington Connected Community Company (KC3), the
company set up to run the project, will be reached after an intricate
diplomatic minuet as the financial sponsors seek to induce KC3 to take the
decisions they would like, without appearing to dictate events. There is
nothing more difficult to deal with than a partnership, sighed one sponsor.
Discussion will be around a new business plan worked out for KC3 by Morton
Hodson, the Worcester consultants, and financed by the Rural Development
Commission, one of the main national sponsors.
Local sponsors include Leominster District Council, which provided KC3 with
a building, and Hereford and Worcestershire Training and Enterprise Council.
The main technical support has come from Apple, which through Rothwell, its
agents, provided 34 computers, and BT, which has fitted Kington into its
ISDN system, giving it state-of-the-art communications.
Mr Russell Brady, Apple's corporate relations officer, said Apple was
'reasonably happy' so far. He went to the heart of what sponsors see as the
Kington problem. 'What is required from Kington is to get some projects
management skills into the community,' he said. 'Management skills have to
be put on top of the enthusiasm and that is up to the community to work
out.'
The Morton Hodson recommendations for Kington are not yet known but their
general drift is fairly clear. They will seek to reconcile, in a business
plan, commercial need and community duty.
'There's got to be a balance,' said Mr Gerald Harris, a Morton Hodson
partner. 'But it's got to work in financial terms.'
The business plan should have been ready last April, but the task was more
complicated than expected. Not only that - Morton Hodson was drawn into
immediate management problems at KC3, he said.
The problem is that KC3 has a lot of gear but no money. At the moment it
does not earn enough to pay staff.
'There are too many machines and not enough bodies to drive them,' said Mr
Phil Pattington, director of technical services at Rothwell.
The orthodox approach to regeneration projects is to put the first 85 per
cent of resources into people and cash, and 15 per cent into gear. At
Kington, it has been the other way round. There are lots of ideas about
using the computers, but not necessarily ideas which produce revenue to keep
the operation going.
The challenge is both to produce revenue and to keep faith with the local
community. The original brief, recalled Mr Miles Swinburne, the KC3 project
manager, was 50-50 community-commercial activity.
'If you start using too much (of the equipment) on the commercial side,
people on the community side cry 'foul',' he said. It is a sign of the
pressures for change already working on KC3 that Mr Swinburne now spends his
time working up outside projects - employment and tourist information
databases for example - and that a new manager has been recruited to run the
KC3 telecentre in the town centre.
'We tried the completely neutral approach of saying 'here we are, what do
you want to do?' But it wasn't focused enough,' Mr Swinburne said.
'We're having to be more proactive, suggesting things beforehand, rather
than later.'

FT  07 JUN 94 / International Company News: Finnish bank reduces losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HELSINKI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Losses at Kansallis-Osake-Pankki, Finland's leading commercial bank,
narrowed sharply to FM275m (Dollars 50m) from FM626m in the first four
months, as it benefited from reduced credit losses, new business and lower
interest rates.
However, it said it expected a full-year deficit of up to FM1bn before
returning to the black next year. Last year, the bank made a FM2.66bn loss,
in its third consecutive year in the red.
The recent improvement was attributed mainly to the drop in credit losses,
from FM933m to FM537m. This would have been much higher had the bank not
anticipated continuing problems by establishing a FM900m general provision
at the end of last year. It used all but FM300m of the facility in the first
four months.
Non-performing assets also showed a downward trend, falling to FM6.8bn at
the end of April from FM7.5bn at the start of the year.
Income from financial operations rose to FM769m from FM666m. Deposit and
lending activity increased, following the bank's acquisition of Savings Bank
of Finland businesses, while lower interest rates cut the costs of funding
non-performing loans.
Non-interest income fell 18 per cent to FM752m.
Last year's figure was helped by sales of forest land and property. Expenses
rose 1 per cent to FM1.14bn.
Mr Pertti Voutilainen, chief executive, said credit losses would weigh
heavily on the Finnish banking sector in 1994 and 1995, despite an improving
economy and falling sector bankruptcies.

FT  07 JUN 94 / Sara Lee plans job cuts and takes Dollars 495m charge
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Sara Lee Corporation, the US foods and personal products company, is to take
a Dollars 495m after-tax charge against earnings in its fourth quarter to
cover its worldwide restructuring.
The measures will include shedding more than 8,000 jobs and closing or
consolidating hosiery manufacturing plants in the US and Europe.
Sara Lee's aim is to improve the performance of its flagging personal
products division, which includes the hosiery brands Hanes and L'eggs; the
knitwear company Champion; and underwear lines Playtex, Bali, Dim and Kiwi.
The charge will cover the cost of cutting Sara Lee's international workforce
by about 6 per cent, or 8,280 employees. The company did not give details of
which factories it plans to close, or where or when personnel reductions
would take place.
The company forecasts that the savings in annual operating costs will build
up to Dollars 250m by 1998.
Ms Ellen Baras, an analyst with Duff and Phelps corporation, said that
restructuring had been expected, though not one so deep or extensive as was
announced yesterday.
'What this does is to accelerate their plan to get their hosiery operations
back on track,' Ms Baras said.
Sara Lee's fourth quarter ends in July, with results due on August 8.
Analysts expect the company to report flat results, with growth tempered by
over-capacity in the hosiery division.
Analysts said that the restructuring resembled similar successful efforts by
Sara Lee to turn around performance in its bakery and packaged meat
operations. 'It's a growth-driven company,' one analyst said. 'The personal
products division has been turning around more slowly than they would like.'
Mr John Bryan, Sara Lee's chairman, said that while the company was 'on
course' and expected to report record sales and earnings for the fiscal
year, its ability to 'compete effectively in rapidly changing markets, both
today and in the future, requires these actions'.
The charge is equal to Dollars 1.03 per share and Dollars 732m before tax.

<TEXT>
Jordan and Israel renewed talks in Washington yesterday which are expected
to make progress on the peace 'agenda' signed by the two countries in
September 1993. It is the first time the two sides have officially met since
peace talks were suspended after the Hebron massacre in February.
Government officials in Amman spoke confidently of a settlement on border
disputes which could be implemented before a overall peace agreement is
signed. Jordan has claimed two strips of land along its border with Israel.
Other subjects to be discussed include water rights and economic ties. The
thorny issue of Palestinian refugees residing in Jordan has been postponed
to a later date to speed progress on the other issues.
While Jordan has given assurances to Syria and Lebanon that it will not sign
a separate agreement with Israel before a comprehensive solution is found,
it has not ruled out implement-ing items on its agenda mean-while.
This latest drive for progress comes at a time when the kingdom feels
increasingly marginalised by developments in the Middle East peace process.

FT  07 JUN 94 / Taiwan premier in surprise visit to Mexico City
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA TYSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TAIPEI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Lien Chan, Taiwan's prime minister, has arrived in Mexico City in a
surprise diversion from a tour of Central America and the US, the first
visit by a senior Taiwanese official to Mexico in 23 years.
The two countries do not maintain official diplomatic relations, having
severed ties in the early 1970s following the United Nations' recognition of
Beijing.
To avoid protests from China, which could have scuttled the visit, Mr Lien's
change in plan was announced in Guatemala just minutes before he stepped on
an aircraft, ostensibly bound for New York.
The trip was another instance of the Taiwanese government's policy of
'pragmatic diplomacy'.
Using a similar formula, President Lee Teng-hui took a 'vacation' tour to
south-east Asian countries in April, during which he played golf with top
officials, sparking vociferous complaints from China.
The premier's visit to Mexico was billed as a bid to boost trade and
investment ties, with a view toward exploiting Mexico's low labour and land
costs and preferential access to US and Canadian markets through the North
American Free Trade Agreement.
Local media reported that Mr Lien was to meet President Carlos Salinas de
Gortari.
The visit coincides with a growing wariness in Taiwan about investing in
China and rising anti-Chinese sentiment in Indonesia and elsewhere in
south-east Asia where Taiwanese businesses have made heavy investments in
recent years.
Analysts in Taipei said that Taiwan may seek support from Mexico for its
application to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
Taiwan is also working to build international support for a bid to rejoin
the UN, which it hopes to bring before the general assembly in the autumn.
Taiwan has formal ties with just 29 states.

FT  07 JUN 94 / Sprint and EDS to continue talks after merger fails
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON and ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KANSAS CITY, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sprint, the US telecommunications group, and Electronic Data Systems, the
world's largest computing services company, said yesterday that they had
abandoned negotiations for a Dollars 30bn merger but were still exploring
other forms of strategic relationship.
The merger talks failed because of a disagreement between the two sides over
the value to be placed on Sprint, according to sources close to the
negotiations.
Mr Les Alberthal, chairman of EDS, and Mr William Esrey, chief executive of
Sprint, said yesterday that they still believed the convergence of their two
industries would create tremendous opportunities. While a merger was no
longer being discussed, 'there may be other ways we can work together to
achieve strategic objectives'.
Sprint, the third largest US long-distance operator, is believed still to be
seeking an alliance with a European telecoms group to further its
international ambitions. It has been in talks with the French and German
state telecoms operators, but the discussions do not appear to have
influenced the failure of the EDS deal.
Sprint, based in Kansas City, Missouri, declines to confirm or deny the
European discussions. But one source claimed yesterday that European
partners had been looking at a significant equity investment in Sprint or
the combined Sprint/EDS group.
One European analyst said: 'Sprint needs an alliance to be credible outside
the US: but it needs a cash injection if it is to go anywhere, which makes a
Franco-German link up very attractive.' A merger with EDS might have led to
the creation of an information services powerhouse, with a market
capitalisation of Dollars 30bn and annual revenues of more than Dollars
20bn.
The immediate reason for the collapse of the merger was money. The proposal
under discussion involved EDS shareholders getting one new share in the
combined company for every EDS share. EDS thought Sprint shareholders should
get 1.1 shares in the new business, while Sprint demanded 1.3. EDS seems to
have been surprised at the premium demanded by Sprint in what had been
billed a 'merger of equals'. However, some Wall Street analysts said
yesterday that a deal at 1.1 ratio could have meant a 10 to 15 per cent
dilution in Sprint earnings per share, while a 1.3 ratio might have added to
first year earnings.
Dallas-based EDS has held discussions with numerous potential
telecommunications partners in recent years - including British Telecom -
but in the past found it hard to clinch alliances because of its unusual
ownership structure.
BT has since forged a Dollars 5.3bn alliance with MCI, the second largest US
telecoms group.
EDS is a subsidiary of General Motors, which retains ownership of its
assets, while holders of a special type of GM stock, known as class E, have
a claim on EDS's dividend stream.
To help the Sprint merger negotiations, GM said last month it could consider
spinning off full ownership of EDS to Class E stockholders through an
exchange of class E stock for new EDS common stock, provided this was tax
free.

Bertelsmann Music, part of the German Bertlesmann media group, has shelved
plans to launch a music video and home-shopping cable-TV channel with
Tele-Communications Inc (TCI), the biggest cable system operator in the US,
AP-DJ reports from New York.
The companies had planned to launch the service later this year in direct
competition with Viacom's MTV channel.
Several large music industry companies, including the music divisions of
Sony, Time Warner, Thorn EMI and Polygram, subsequently announced plans to
launch a music channel. New regulations have led cable companies to cut
revenue forecasts and some are trimming plans for new channels.
TCI and Bertelsmann dropped plans for their music and shopping channel due
to 'changing market conditions' Bertelsmann said.
The companies were continuing to discuss other possible ventures, it added.
Bertelsmann Music's revenues rose to Dollars 3bn last year from Dollars
2.7bn in 1992.

FT  07 JUN 94 / International Company News: France warned on hotels bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Forte of the UK yesterday received a boost in its battle to win control of
the Meridien hotel chain, as the European Commission appeared to warn the
French government against political interference in the sale.
Forte is pitted against Accor, the French hotel group, for control of
Meridien, which is 57 per cent owned by Air France. Forte's bid, supported
by the Meridien management, values the chain at FFr1.8bn (Dollars 317m).
Accor has submitted a bid which values it at FFr1.6bn, with the cash to be
provided by Prince al-Waleed of Saudi Arabia. The prince last week also
announced he would buy up to 24 per cent of the Euro Disney theme park.
Air France has referred the rival bids to the privatisation commission, an
independent body which advises the French government on privatisation
issues. The referral was seen as evidence of strong pressure on Air France
to sell Meridien to a French buyer.
The European Commission's warning appears in a letter to the French
government carried in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
The letter contains the Commission's comments on the French government's
plan to provide a FFr20bn capital injection to Air France.
It says: 'The Commission needs to be assured that the government will allow
Air France's management to run the companies of the group solely according
to commercial principles. . . . In this context, the Commission would refer
particularly to the disposal of certain non-core assets.'
Mr Gerard Pelisson, Accor's joint chairman, said Accor's bid should succeed,
even on purely commercial grounds. Forte declined to comment.

FT  07 JUN 94 / World Trade News: BAe wins Colombia jet order

<TEXT>
British Aerospace yesterday won a Dollars 230m (Pounds 153.3m) order for
regional jets from Colombia and confirmed it was discussing a possible
regional aircraft link-up with Fokker, the Dutch aircraft group controlled
by Deutsche Aerospace.
The Colombian deal involves an order for BAe's regional jet division, Avro
International, for eight RJ100 Avroliners from Colombia's Sociedad
Aeronautica de Medelln Consolidada.
Confirmation of talks between BAe and Deutsche Aerospace over a possible
link with Fokker reflects the efforts of the European industry to
rationalise regional jet business.
BAe said no decision had been made on a possible link-up with Fokker. The
British company is also discussing an alliance in the turbopropeller
regional aircraft sector with Aerospatiale of France.

<TEXT>
The Spanish government yesterday expressed its firm interest in
participating in the development of a new generation European military
transport aircraft, the so-called Future Large Aircraft. Mr Julian
Garcia-Vargas, Spanish defence minister, told Mr Volker Ruhe, his German
counterpart, that Europe should draw on the experience both of the Airbus
consortium and the Eurofighter project in building the FLA. The Eurofighter
project, he said, showed the disadvantage of increasing costs when the
participating countries reduced their orders. The Spanish interest in the
FLA project will raise the pressure on the British government to decide on
its own participation. Hitherto, Britain has favoured buying Hercules
aircraft from the US for its next phase of military transport needs but
British Aerospace is anxious to be involved in the European project, to
which both Germany and France have committed themselves.

FT  07 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Unilever slides
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CLARE GASCOIGNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The continuing controversy over Unilever's new washing powder undermined the
shares, which finished a tortuous session 22 down at 975p with turnover an
above average 2m. Analysts estimated the company's investment in 'Persil
Power' at Pounds 300m, with prospective annual UK sales weighing in at
around the same level.
The share price fall came after Unilever withdrew its litigation threat
against arch-rival Procter &amp; Gamble, following allegations by the US group
that the new detergent ruined clothes. They said that their claims were
supported by independent tests and backed by consumer bodies.
Top of the range preliminary profits from BAA and news of a planned
one-for-one share split triggered a strong performance by shares in the
airports group. They reached a session high of 957p before settling a net 11
better at 949p following above average turnover of 1.2m.
Citing the potential benefits of a further 75,000 square feet increase in
retail space and a forecast 4 per cent rise in traffic volumes, Panmure
Gordon upgraded its current year profits forecast to Pounds 370m. NatWest,
which expects BAA to achieve profits of Pounds 365m, described the shares as
a 'good strong hold'.
Commercial Union shares moved ahead strongly, with insurance specialists
continuing to dismiss the latest crop of market rumours suggesting that CU
is contemplating a bid for the French insurance company Group Victoire.
'CU could not afford to buy the whole of Victoire, which would cost in the
region of Pounds 1.3bn,' said one leading insurance analyst. 'Maybe they
could acquire certain parts of the business if it was broken up by Suez,
Victoire's parent.'
CU advanced 16 to 548p, although turnover in the stock was a modest 857,000
shares.
Sedgwick, the insurance broker, staged a good rally after the recent poorly
received results, the shares moving up 8 to 172p.
Life stocks also made good progress, shrugging off recent worries about
disclosure of commissions, as well as other increasing pressures on the life
assurance industry.
Prudential moved ahead 7 to 296p after Robert Fleming Securities issued its
first positive recommendation on the company since early 1992, and said it
expected the shares to outperform by 10 per cent over the next year as the
market appreciates that higher interest rates are good news for traditional
life assurers.
The Fleming insurance team said: 'In contrast to popular belief, the recent
rise in bond yields improves the profitability of traditional life
companies; it increases embedded values and actuarial surpluses. The latter
takes some of the pressure off bonus reductions and protects the built-in
dividend growth.'
Bank shares extended the rally evident at the end of last week when big US
funds were said to have been aggressive buyers of the sector. National
Westminster featured with a further 11 gain at 467p, while Standard
Chartered was the FT-SE 100's best individual performer, climbing 12 to
252p.
Motor issues were strong on the back of new car sales figures for May, up 10
per cent from the previous year to 150,070 and compared with only a 5 per
cent rise in April. Laird rose 11 1/2 to 390p and GKN was up 7 to 590p.
Smiths Industries benefited from its Pounds 150m purchase of medical
equipment company Deltec from Pharmacia AB, rising 18 to 470p. The
acquisition takes the medical side to around 45 per cent of group operating
profit, adding about Pounds 90m sales in the growing area of out-patient
care. Strauss Turnbull raised its forecast for pre-tax profits for the year
to July 1995 from Pounds 129m to Pounds 133m, taking forecast earnings from
29p to 30p per share.
The telecoms team at Hoare Govett was said to have been the driving force
behind the latest good performance from Cable and Wireless, highlighting the
new management team at Hong Kong Telecom and the growth potential of the
Chinese telecoms market. C&amp;W firmed 6 more to 443p.
VSEL fell a further 35 to 875p, after going ex-dividend and on further
consideration of last week's results.
British Gas, which has underperformed the rest of the market recently, rose
8 to 269p, helped by a Swiss Bank 'buy' recommendation. Analyst Mr Alan
Marshall said: 'Concerns over the security of the dividend are, in our
opinion, exaggerated.' The next consultative document on British Gas is
expected later this month.
Profit-taking and ex-dividend calculations took the shine from recent firm
showings among leading property stocks MEPC and Land Securities, the former
slipping 8 to 446p and the latter 3 1/2 to 635p.
Euro Disney again basked in the afterglow of the news that a Saudi Arabian
prince is to invest in the theme park operator. The shares surged ahead 29
to 415p.
News of a good take-up of the rights issue at Compass Group came as the
fully-paid shares gained 6 at 321p.
The Great Universal Stores share buy-back story was again doing the rounds,
with the stock spurting forward 13 to 578p.
Stores specialists said there was increasing expectation in the market that
the company would announce the move - rumoured to be in the range of Pounds
1bn - with its preliminary results next month.
Marks and Spencer was another firm feature in the stores sector, going
ex-dividend but still managing an effective gain of 9 at 399p. WH Smith 'A'
was also in demand, moving 11 ahead to 482p.

FT  07 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Regional jet talks lift BAe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CLARE GASCOIGNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Confirmation from British Aerospace that it is in talks with Deutsche
Aerospace with a view to taking a minority stake in Dutch regional jet
manufacturer Fokker saw BAe shares jump 16 to 459p, a rise consolidated by
late-breaking news of a Dollars 230m contract with Colombia to acquire eight
RJ100 aircraft.
The talks were greeted with enthusiasm as the first stage towards cutting
competition in the regional jet industry and reducing the need for research
and development spending. BAe, which made provisions of Pounds 1bn on
regional jets in 1992 and a further Pounds 250m on turboprops in 1993, has
suffered from the over-capacity in the industry and fears that falling
residual values on aircraft will hit its leasing book.
'Bringing the two together and producing a limited range of aircraft means a
greater chance of making money,' said Mr Charles Donald at Panmure Gordon.
'As a first step in industry restructuring, it is a sound move.'

FT  07 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Equity derivatives held a fairly steady course, managing to preserve gains
made in the previous session, Christine Buckley writes.
Activity was modest, with just under a third of the 13,111 volume in the
June contract on the FT-SE 100 attributed to a roll over of positions. Some
4,000 were rolled into the September contract, making a significant amount
of the day's trade directionless.
With June near to its expiry, and fair value at zero, the contract traded at
a discount to cash for large periods of the session. But it did muster a
small premium on a couple of occasions and hit a day's high of 3,020 just
after Wall Street opened. Its low had been struck very early in the session
when it slipped 3 points from an opening 2,993.
Some negative arbitrage has been observed lately, with the June contract
having fallen so low that buyers have moved into the future and gone short
on stocks.
Traders were hesitant about calling the mood in stock index futures, blaming
the absence of any real pointers in the market. June closed 4 points up on
the day at 2,997.
Low activity in traded options made for a modest 22,879 lots, with the FT-SE
100 option recording only 8,660 and the Euro FT-SE 4,368. The most active
stock option was British Gas at 2,159 contracts.

FT  07 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Dismal volume reflects market
uncertainties - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A nervous and thinly traded session in UK equities yesterday saw share
prices close firmly behind early gains in the Dow Industrial Average and in
US bonds. The prospect of the elections this week to the European Parliament
provided an extra note of uncertainty in markets still concerned over
inflation prospects on both sides of the Atlantic.
At midsession the market was ahead by more than 18 points on the Footsie
scale but equities later lost heart when UK government bonds gave back an
initial advance. A closing rally, which left the FT-SE 100 Index at 3,009.4,
up 11.6 on the day, owed much to a slow improvement in Federal bonds and to
the reading of plus 13 points on the Dow Average at the London close. The
FT-SE Mid 250 Index ended 14.1 ahead at 3,571.4.
But a more revealing image of the trading session was given by the Seaq
volume of only 436.4m shares, nearly 40 per cent down from Friday's figure
and one of the lowest genuine daily totals for the year.
Shares opened nervously as investors waited to see if US Federal bonds would
hold the gains scored at the close of trading in New York on Friday. When
European bonds, including UK gilts, moved higher, the London stock market
responded, but with some caution. Sentiment was encouraged by reports that a
New York newspaper had quoted reassuring comments from several Federal
Reserve governors on last week's US unemployment data.
There was little market response to the announcement of a sharp fall in new
UK consumer credit in April, a move which could be seen as favourable for
inflation but discouraging for economic recovery prospects.
London continued to edge forward until just before the time for New York to
open, when initial uncertainty in Federal bonds was quickly reflected across
European fixed interest markets. A later rally in Federal securities came
late in the London trading day.
With both the economic calendar and the company reporting list somewhat
light this week, individual features were thin on the ground. Unilever
shares fell on reports of an attack on its latest detergent product by a
rival manufacturer.
The general caution ahead of this week's European elections lay particularly
heavy across the London stock market because of fears that Mr John Major's
ruling Conservative government may come under further pressure in
Westminster and in the public opinion polls.
There was further demand yesterday for the utility shares, which have
attracted investors looking for stocks which often combine good current
yields and the hope of further dividend rises. The market's dividend
optimism was encouraged yesterday by a sharply higher payout from BAA, which
owns and manages Britain's major airports, and reported buoyant air
passenger traffic. Dividend increases have provided support for the market,
against the background of other uncertainties.
There were also sharp rises among the banks and financial stocks but trading
volumes across the market indicated that genuine investment interest was on
hold for the time being. Fund managers, having seen the Footsie succeed in
recovering the 3,000 mark, appeared to be waiting for convincing evidence
that this level can be held before putting further funds into the London
market.

FT  07 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets: Brazil surges 8 per cent
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Sao Paulo ended 7.9 per cent stronger after heavy trade spurred by
optimism over the government's anti-inflation plan, which includes the
adoption of a new currency, and strong overseas buying. The Bovespa index
surged 2,127 to 29,087. Turnover came to Cr502.4bn.
A broker said many foreign investors rushed to the cash market after the
Bovespa futures index broke the 30,700-point resistance level.
Food, retail, beverage, clothing and state blue chips led the rally.
Analysts said the July 1 introduction of the new currency, the real, is
expected to sharply reduce Brazil's 45 per cent monthly inflation, paving
the way for a surge in consumer spending.
Brokers observed that investor sentiment was also helped by reports at the
weekend that Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the current economy minister and
a presidential candidate, had seen an improvement in his standing in opinion
polls.
Salomon Brothers, in a recent commentary, noted that the possibility of a
victory in the October elections by the left-wing candidate Mr Luiz Inacio
da Silva could not be ruled out, but placed the possibility of a Cardoso
victory at around 55 per cent.

FT  07 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Program sales cause late Dow
reversal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
A late burst of program selling left US stocks in negative territory
yesterday in spite of solid gains in the bond market, writes Frank McGurty
in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished a net 3.70 easier at 3,768.52
after surrendering a 16-point gain in the final minutes of the session. The
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 lost 1.25 at 458.88 and NYSE volume
was moderate at 259m shares. In the secondary markets, the American SE
composite inched 0.75 ahead to 442.59 and the Nasdaq composite improved 1.05
to 743.43.
Until minutes before the close, most share prices were well above their
opening levels. There was no fresh economic news, giving investors time to
reflect on supportive comments made by three of the Federal Reserve's five
governors. An article in The New York Times quoted the officials as saying
that inflation was now in check, suggesting the central bank would not make
another move to lift short-term rates in the near future.
The prospect of low inflation and a stable monetary policy allowed the bond
market to extend a rally that began on Friday with the release of data on
May employment conditions. The benchmark 30-year bond was ending the day
with moderate gains, a direction paralleled by most share prices until the
session's final minutes.
Consumer products and food groups were actively traded. Philip Morris
advanced Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 50 7/8 and Sara Lee, which announced a
worldwide restructuring, rose Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 23 3/8 .
Pepsico dropped Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 34 5/8 , just above its 52-week low
of Dollars 34 1/2 . Goldman Sachs removed the stock from its recommended
list and cut its earnings estimate for the company, based on a disappointing
performance by Pepsico's restaurant division.
Merger news was stirring up the communications sector. Sprint was marked
down Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 38 after suspending talks on a possible link-up
with Electronic Data Systems, the data- processing arm of General Motors.
EDS, which is traded as class 'E' shares of its parent, dipped Dollars  1/4
to Dollars 35.
Meanwhile, Times Mirror fell Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 32 3/4 on news that it
agreed to sell its cable television operations to Cox Enterprises for
Dollars 2.3bn. Cox shares are not publicly traded.
In the computer sector, International Business Machines gained Dollars 1 3/4
at Dollars 62 5/8 on reports that its margins had improved recently. Compaq
Computer finished Dollars 1 down at Dollars 110 3/4 after climbing as much
as Dollars 3 3/8 during the session.
In electronics retailing, CompUSA shed Dollars 2 3/8 , or nearly 23 per
cent, to Dollars 9 1/2 , a 52-week low for the stock. Janney Montgomery
Scott recommended a sell following the company's warning of a possible
fourth-quarter loss.
The Nasdaq advanced in spite of weakness in several key issues. Lotus
Development declined Dollars 2 to Dollars 56 1/4 and Oracle slipped Dollars
1 1/2 to Dollars 36 3/8.

FT  07 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei continues
downward technical correction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PATTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Equities fell for the third consecutive session yesterday, but market
sentiment remained upbeat, writes Robert Patton in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 average lost 227.54 at 20,726.65. Although the index opened
above Friday's high at 20,954.19, prices drifted lower throughout the
morning. Early declines were limited by overseas buying from both foreign
and domestic brokerage firms. But in the afternoon, index-linked selling
brought the market down, pushing it to a day's low of 20,707.54 just before
the close. Declines were well ahead of advances by 765 to 266, with 152
stocks unchanged.
The Nikkei 300 slipped 3.14 to 303.66 and the first section Topix index shed
15.10 to 1,664.52. Volume, estimated at 260m shares, was down sharply from
the 382.8m that changed hands on Friday. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index
firmed 2.45 to 1,369.72.
Many investors were waiting for Friday's release of the tankan, a quarterly
survey of business sentiment by the Bank of Japan, and trading volume was
likely to remain relatively light until then.
Although there were reports that North Korea had threatened war if economic
sanctions were imposed, analysts did not believe that this was a significant
factor in the day's decline. Most felt that the market was simply going
through an overdue correction after rising 3 per cent in recent weeks and
topping 21,000 for the first time in eight months.
Minibea, a leading miniature bearing manufacturer, rose for the third
consecutive day and hit a new high for the year of Y812 before closing Y17
up at Y807 after 4.2m shares traded, the third highest volume of the day. In
the face of the strong currency, Minibea's expansion into south east Asia,
with production bases in Thailand and Singapore, brokers said, made the
company attractive to investors.
Many of last week's high-technology and large-capital winners fell back,
some on very active trading. Volume leader Hitachi slipped Y20 to Y1070 with
6.2m shares changing hands. Oki Electric closed at Y864, down Y6, and
Fujitsu was off Y10 at Y1100.
Second most active stock Mitsubishi Heavy Industries eased Y3 to Y763 with
5m shares dealt. Kawasaki Heavy Industries shed Y8 to Y375 and Mitsui
Engineering and Shipbuilding declined Y7 to Y375.
In Osaka, the OSE average finished 117.52 off at 23,082.60 in volume of
56.2m shares.
Roundup
The region was mixed yesterday. Seoul and New Zealand were closed for
holidays.
HONG KONG put aside worries that a government package to cool the housing
market, to be announced tomorrow, would push commercial property prices
lower as well. The Hang Seng index improved 148.76, or 1.6 per cent, to
9,383.03.
Among property issues, out of favour last week, Cheung Kong moved forward
HKDollars 1.25 to HKDollars 39, Henderson Land gained HKDollars 1.25 at
HKDollars 41.25 and Sun Hung Kai Properties rose HKDollars 2 to HKDollars
52.50.
China's state-run Dongfang Electrical Machinery made a solid debut, ending
at HKDollars 3.175, against its HKDollars 2.83 issue price.
HSBC picked up 50 cents to HKDollars 86.50 after being sold last week on
concern over the dilution from an enhanced scrip dividend.
KUALA LUMPUR was firmer after a session marked by active buying interest in
second and third line counters. The composite index gained 4.57 at 970.06.
Among heavily traded issues, Granite Industries rose 95 cents to MDollars
5.15, while Golden Hope put on 36 cents at MDollars 4.24 amid reports that
it would gain from a large government project.
SINGAPORE edged ahead, the Straits Times Industrial index adding 3.21 at
2,271.91 in volume of 98.8m shares.
Hotels found favour amid expectations that property groups were considering
redevelopment projects. Hotel Negara led the gains, jumping SDollars 1.00 to
SDollars 19.23, followed by Seaview Hotel with a 90-cent rise to SDollars
11.10 on an upward revision of its net asset value, traders said.
TAIPEI finished off the session's high, with brokers forecasting that the
market was heading for a period of consolidation. The weighted index was
ahead 37.92 at 6,077.25 after seeing a high of 6,118.69. Turnover rose to
TDollars 73.8bn.
MANILA dropped sharply on profit-taking in a number of issues. The composite
index slipped 38.12 to 3,022.06 in turnover down to 633m pesos from Friday's
820m pesos.
SYDNEY was deflated by a decline in the gold shares index, leading the All
Ordinaries index off 6.1 at 2,072.5.
Brokers said that gold stocks were undermined by weaker bullion prices and
Papua New Guinea's suspension of new mining projects. Turnover amounted to
ADollars 328.6m.
Newcrest Mining fell 28 cents to ADollars 6.52, Dome Resources 7 cents to 45
cents and Highlands 4 cents to ADollars 1.40.
BANGKOK firmed in low volume, the SET index closing 5.01 up at 1,363.01.
Turnover was down to Bt4.5bn.
The finance sector was the day's biggest gainer, up 1 per cent, with Asia
Securities Trading adding Bt1 at Bt99.

FT  07 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Zurich up 1.9%, responds to US
equity strength
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bourses were mostly sleepy, although Zurich and Tel Aviv managed to take
sentiment to extremes, writes Our Markets Staff.
ZURICH pushed 1.9 per cent higher, led by the strength of the futures market
in a belated response to Friday's performance on Wall Street. The SMI index
rose 53.0 to 2,781.4, decisively above recent resistance at 2,770, prompting
expectations that the index could now be heading for the 2,820 level.
Roche certificates, under further pressure last week, bounced SFr170 to
SFr6,880. Renewed support was noted from Mr Martin Ebner's BZ Bank, with the
market unperturbed by news that the pharmaceuticals group had extended the
deadline for its agreed takeover of Syntex to July 1 after the US Federal
Trade Commission asked for more information on the deal.
Sandoz registered added SFr9 at SFr700, their best performance since the
group's bid for Gerber, the US babyfood producer, a fortnight ago.
Financials were in demand on stronger bond futures. UBS bearers moved ahead
SFr30 to SFr1,245 and SBC bearers put on SFr13 at SFr430. CS Holding
bearers, trading ex the dividend and a shareholder option, rose SFr18 to
SFr611.
FRANKFURT featured an afternoon conflict between its bond and equity
markets, the former influenced by qualified encouragement on interest rate
and inflation prospects by Mr Dieter Hiss, a Bundesbank council member, and
the latter watching Wall Street rise.
The Dax index extended Friday's carefree, but lightweight, pattern, climbing
14.68 to 2,163.07 on the session and holding its ground after hours to end
at an Ibis-indicated 2,163.59. Turnover stayed low, up from DM5.1bn to
DM5.2bn.
However, said Mr Horst-Kaspar Greven at Merck Finck in Dusseldorf, most of
the gains came on Friday afternoon when the Dax closed at 2,158.88; and
while equities seemed sleepily content, this was not the case with bonds,
down 25 basis points late in the day when US bonds were 66 points to the
good.
Siemens exemplified the pattern of the day, up DM8.50 at DM708.50 on the
session after its semiconductors subsidiary projected a 29 per cent sales
gain in 1994; but the afternoon close was only DM1.50 higher at DM706.60.
AMSTERDAM built on Friday's gains and the AEX index closed 4.27 up at
407.35, with strength in a broad range of blue chips. Activity was helped by
an unexpected, 10 basis-point cut by the central bank in the special advance
rate.
Wolters Kluwer, the publishing group, improved Fl 1.40 to Fl 112.40 after
Goldman Sachs added it to its European Priority list. The investment bank
said that it expected earnings per share to grow by 19 per cent over the
next three years.
Unilever was among the day's disappointments, the shares declining 70 cents
to Fl 191, as its 'war of words' with Procter &amp; Gamble over the quality of
washing powders entered a new phase.
There was considerable technical trading in Nedlloyd, the transport and
shipping group, under pressure last week with the shares losing some 7 per
cent; this helped it to a gain of Fl 2.10 at Fl 68.00.
PARIS could find little to motivate activity and the CAC-40 index moved in a
narrow 20 point range before closing off 5.49 at 2,037.15. Turnover eased to
FFr3.9bn.
Euro Disney was again one of the few highlights, the stock rising FFr2.00 or
almost 6 per cent to FFr36.50, as more buyers came into the market following
last week's news of a capital injection by a Saudi prince. Carrefour dipped
FFr7 to FFr1,910 as the retailer noted a 7 per cent rise in sales between
January and May.
MADRID followed afternoon weakness in the bond market, the general index
losing most of its early gains to close 0.77 higher at 327.06 in turnover of
Pta28.8bn. For Kleinwort Benson, Ms Clare Miles advised investors to hold,
saying that the economic recovery was continuing and that, each month, more
indicators have been showing a reocvery of demand and output.
Construction stocks were among the better performers, Cubiertas rising
Pta340 to Pta11,990, Pta200 to Pta15,400 and Huarte Pta65 to Pta1,905.
MILAN marked time, the Comit index nudging 2.57 higher to 738.93 in very
quiet trading.
Montedison was exceptionally active, adding L28 or 2 per cent to L1,458 in
hefty volume of 27.4m shares as expectations grew that its proposed plastics
merger with Shell would win the blessing of the European Union tomorrow.
The shares also benefited from rumours that Gemina might be building a
stake: the financial holding company, which said on Friday that it had
liquid funds of L320bn, put on L30 to L1,681.
STOCKHOLM found support in gains by Astra and Volvo, the Affarsvarlden index
gaining 9.1 to 1,487.0.
Astra A shares gained SKr4 to SKr172 on speculation that it was close to
assuaging German worries about its best-selling Losec ulcer treatment. Volvo
B shares rose SKr23 to SKr747 in response to reports that sales volume rose
by 25 per cent in the first five months of the year.
TEL AVIV dived 6 per cent, wiping out all of Sunday's 4 per cent gain, with
mutual funds being seen as heavy sellers. The Mishtanim index finished 10.48
down at 172.30 in high turnover of Shk260m.

FT  07 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets: FT-Actuaries World Index
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Weakness in Asia, excluding Japan, held back the FT-Actuaries World Index
last week. Mr David Bates of Asia Equity in London says Singapore fell
simply on its long term association with the trading of Malaysian equities.
The real problem, he says, was margin calls and the anticipation of them in
Kuala Lumpur, which left the domestic Malaysian equity market with a 5.1 per
cent fall in local currency terms, taking its loss this year to 27.1 per
cent; rumours of local brokerage failures added to the general malaise. Hong
Kong's retreat was property related, following a disappointing land auction.

FT  07 JUN 94 / Markets Report: US dollar consolidates
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar consolidated Fri-day's gains in fairly light trading yesterday,
as dealers marked time ahead of the Bundesbank council meeting and the
European elections later this week.
Remarks from Mr Dieter Hiss, a Bundesbank council member, were seen as
confirming recent indications that the scope for further German interest
rate cuts was limited. Meanwhile, Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative,
said the administration had not pursued a policy of driving up the yen.
However, support for the dollar was hardly overwhelming, and while the US
currency finished ahead of Friday's closing levels, it ended below
yesterday's opening rates.
The dollar opened the day with some momentum following Friday's sharp fall
in US unemployment, which made traders believe that further interest rate
increases by the Federal Reserve were more likely.
Dealers were also perceived as being unenthusiastic about European
currencies ahead of Thursday's polls, and the strength of the US Treasury
bond market was seen as lending the dollar support.
Mr Hiss, head of the regional central bank for Berlin and Brandenburg, said
in Berlin that room for lower German interest rates would decrease if US
interest rates continued to rise.
Mr Adrian Cunningham, senior currency economist at UBS, said: 'Until now,
the Bundesbank has stood clear of implying a link between German and US
monetary policy.'
The Hiss remarks were seen as a further sign that official German interest
rates were unlikely to fall much further, although Mr Hiss added: 'The
current level of discount and Lombard rates leaves room for an adjustment of
the repo rate, which is the main refinancing rate for the banking system.'
Meanwhile, Mr Kantor's remarks were the latest in a series of comments by US
officials, seemingly designed to correct the market impression, formed
earlier this year, that the Clinton administration was happy to see a weaker
dollar.
However, not all official comment was positive for the dollar yesterday.
Three Federal Reserve governors, Mr Lawrence Lindsey, Mr Edward Kelley and
Mr John LaWare, were quoted in the New York Times as saying the pace of US
economic growth had slowed.
Traders perceived the comments as indicating that the pace of Fed interest
rate increases might ease.
The dollar ended in London at DM1.6692, up from Friday's close of DM1.6665
but below yesterday's DM1.6700 opening. Against the yen, the dollar closed
at Y105.35, compared with Friday's Y105.245 finish. Yesterday's New York
close was DM1.6705 and Y105.275.
Sterling's exchange rate index edged up to 80.6, after opening yesterday at
80.5 and closing on Friday at 80.4.
The pound drifted higher against the D-Mark, closing at DM2.5164 from
Friday's DM2.5074. However, sterling's strength against the D-Mark was seen
as merely tracking the dollar/D-Mark rate.
Against the US unit, the pound edged up to Dollars 1.5076 from Friday's
Dollars 1.5046, but Mr Peter Luxton, economic adviser, global foreign
exchange at Barclays Bank, said it cannot break through Dollars 1.51.
'Expectation of higher base rates gives sterling some support,' said Mr Neil
MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank in London. He thinks Mr Eddie George,
governor of the Bank of England, will press for  1/4 percentage point rise
in base rates when he meets Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor of the
exchequer, on Wednesday.
'So far, the indications are that the tax increases have not had an adverse
effect on the economy,' added Mr MacKinnon. Yesterday's consumer credit
figures were interpreted by the markets as showing that the recovery was
still on track.
'The pound should sail through the European election results since the
market is already discounting bad news for the Conservatives,' Mr MacKinnon
went on to say, although he feels that sterling's potential upside in the
summer will be limited by international investor concern about a potential
Tory leadership election.
The central bank of the Netherlands cut 10 basis points off the special
advances rate, reducing it to 5.0 per cent, in a move seen as reflecting
recent guilder strength against the D-Mark.
The guilder finished the day virtually unchanged against the German currency
at DM0.892, versus Friday's closing level of DM0.893.
The Italian lira ended higher against the D-Mark, rising above the L970
level to close at L969.4, from L971.7 on Friday. According to Mr Avinash
Persaud, head of currency research at JP Morgan (Europe), the Italian unit
benefited from a perception of reduced interest rate risk and from strong
figures on trade and automotive sales.
In the UK money markets, the Bank of England provided Pounds 375m of
assistance in two tranches yesterday, after earlier forecasting a shortage
of Pounds 350m. Overnight rates traded between 3 and 4 7/8 per cent.

FT  07 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmer's Viewpoint): Germany's
political stone-throwing on BSE - The row over 'mad cow disease' is not
based only on concerns for consumers' health
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID RICHARDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Agriculturally speaking the Germans are living in a glass house but are
still throwing stones. For in spite of their continuing refusal to accept
that British beef is safe to import - a policy that is widely recognised as
being based more on politics than on science - they have animal health
problems of their own that are spilling over into other European Union
countries.
Bovine spongiform encephalopathy has already been identified in some German,
and for that matter French, cattle so it is not exclusively a British
problem. The campaign to ban British beef that has been waged by Mr Horst
Seehofer, the German health minister, in the face of the acceptance of the
Commission and all other EU member nations that it poses no health problem,
is embarrassing some of his colleagues and his countrymen.
With a clutch of regional and national elections in various parts of Germany
scheduled for the next few months, a political gesture in apparent
protection of green-minded German consumers was, perhaps, predictable. But
the German agriculture minister, Mr Jochen Borchert, is said to have
accepted privately that the new EU measures to ban the use of ruminant offal
in ruminant animal feeds across the union - which have been in force in the
UK, incidentally, since 1988 - 'should be sufficient'.
Meanwhile the health minister's stance is damaging sales of
domestically-reared beef in Germany. Some consumers, apparently, have been
put off eating any beef whatever its origin, much to the disgust of German
beef farmers and, one suspects, their agriculture minister. The fact that
beef exports from Britain to Germany were worth a mere Pounds 1m last year
puts the matter into perspective.
Meanwhile Germany has an animal health problem of its own that is
threatening to get out of hand. Since last autumn many herds of German pigs
have succumbed to classical swine fever - a highly contagious disease rated
in the top category of seriousness by EU veterinarians.
EU policy is to try to eradicate the disease as quickly as possible wherever
it breaks out and, to this end, affected herds are slaughtered, the
carcasses destroyed to avoid spreading the disease via the meat and
compensation payed to the farmers concerned.
During the last quarter of 1993 and the first quarter of this year 1.08m
German pigs were slaughtered under the scheme. This was equivalent to 4 per
cent of the national herd, about 3.5 per cent of normal German sales of pigs
during the period and just under 1 per cent of total EU pig sales. In Lower
Saxony, where the majority of cases occurred, some 12 per cent of the
region's pigs were slaughtered. In spite of the slaughterings, however,
outbreaks of classical swine fever are still appearing across Germany.
There are, perhaps, a number of reasons for this failure to control the
disease. One may be that not all infected carcasses have been destroyed.
German consumers, faced with rising pork prices, demanded that the meat
should not be wasted. In response the authorities decided to render that
believed to be safe for use in processing, a decision that may have been
influenced by the fact that the German allocation of EU funds for fighting
such animal disease had run out. And this compromise may have allowed the
problem to spread. In any event, Teutonic efficiency appears to have failed
in this case.
Classical swine fever has now spread from Germany into Belgium, whose
densely populated pig herd is at risk. There too the EU slaughter and
compensation policy is being implemented.
Needless to say, British pig farmers are becoming concerned that the disease
will cross the Channel and affect their herds. It would not be the first
time such a thing had happened - the last case of classical swine fever in a
British herd was thought to have been caused by a continental tourist
throwing the remains of his salami sandwich into a field in which pigs were
grazing.
Other diseases that have affected British pigs over the years and cost
British pig farmers dear, have been traced back to continental sources.
Aujeskys Disease, for instance, cost millions of pounds in lost production.
A UK producer-funded and ultimately successful eradication scheme raised
Pounds 27m to complete the task.
There is no need to spell out what farmers' feelings would be should it once
more be introduced from across the Channel.
Swine Vesicular Disease and Blue Ear Disease have all reached Britain's
shores via similar routes. And now the EU has relaxed border controls there
is a real fear among all British livestock farmers - not just those with
pigs - that herds and flocks may be decimated and incomes destroyed by some
disease or other crossing the water or coming through the Channel Tunnel.
The risks are exacerbated by the virtually open borders between eastern
Europe and the EU. It is well-known that all sorts of nasty diseases
originate from behind what was the Iron Curtain.
The UK minister of agriculture, Mrs Gillian Shephard, recently tightened
inspection rules on imported livestock and the House of Commons Agriculture
Select Committee is investigating health controls on imported animals. All
of which is intended to reassure British farmers and consumers. But, it
might take only a discarded sandwich from a German tourist to bring it all
to nought.

FT  07 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Oil prices ease back as demand
begins to slacken
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Oil prices weakened yesterday amid signs that demand from refiners was
beginning to ease after a period of strong buying in preparation for the
summer holiday season in the US.
The price of light crude futures in New York fell below the pyschologically
important Dollars 18 per barrel level. That helped to undermine the price of
the benchmark Brent Blend, which was quoted at around Dollars 16.25 a barrel
in late London trading, down from its close last Friday of Dollars 16.37.
Earlier the International Energy Agency left unchanged its demand forecasts
for the remainder of the year. It was the first time in recent months that
it has not revised the forecasts upwards due to strong demand in the US.
But the forecast for full year demand in the industrialised countries of the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development of 39.7m barrels a
day remains well above the 39.1m b/d recorded last year, the IEA said.
In its latest monthly oil market report the Paris-based IEA also reported
that refining margins in the OECD countries were being eroded as '. . .
average product prices rose less strongly than crude prices' in April and
May.

FT  07 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: 'No ANC threat' to gold rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
South Africa's new government will not nationalise the gold mines or
threaten mineral rights, according to Mr Marcel Golding, an ANC member of
parliament.
Mr Golding, who spent 10 years as a mining union official, told the
Financial Times World Gold Conference in London that the damage caused by
apartheid should not be underestimated. 'The vote will not immediately
remove all the warts.' But gold mining remained the backbone of the South
African economy, employing 380,000 workers. Millions more depended directly
or indirectly on the industry.
'The challenge of transition is to ensure that living standards are
enhanced,' said Mr Golding. While the industry had moved away from
confrontation, further co-operation between the government, mining companies
and the unions would be needed.
Mr Clem Sunter, chairman of the gold and uranium division of Anglo American
Corporation of South Africa, said that in 1985 the company had written a
fairy tale which it called The High Road, specifying four conditions for the
continuing health of the mining sector: a comprehensive negotiated political
settlement; free enterprise as the basis of the economy; the devolvement of
political power to local authorities; and the end of economic sanctions
against the country.
'Our scenario team is cock-a-hoop about recent developments,' he told the
conference. 'So far so good. South Africa has become a very attractive place
to invest.'
South Africa, still the biggest gold producer in the world with 32 per cent,
had produced 44,000 tonnes of gold from the Witwatersrand basin since mining
began. Throughout history the world has produced only 120,000 tonnes.
Mr Sunter said that while most of the big fish in the basin had been caught,
there were probably a few more. However the depth of the seams meant that it
was expensive to establish a new mine.
South Africa's annual output peaked at 1,000 tonnes in 1970. It had been
steady at 600 tonnes for the last few years, a level it should be able to
maintain for several years. 'Virtually the whole industry is viable given
the current price and rand-dollar exchange rate.'
Mr Chris Stals, governor of the South African Reserve Bank, said that the
pressures on foreign reserves during the run-up to the change of governement
had forced the country to reduce its gold reserves and gold swap portfolio.
The country now intended to rebuild its foreign reserves. 'From our own
experience with the management of the country's international reserves in
the years of South Africa's economic isolation, we have learned the value of
gold in the official foreign reserves for a country in distress. We believe
it is also a good investment for a country at peace with the rest of the
world.'
Mr Jean Zwahlen, a member of the governing board of the Swiss National Bank,
said gold was virtually the only asset that did not constitute someone
else's liability. The SNB holds 2,600 tonnes, equivalent to 370 grams per
capita - the highest level in the world. It was unlikely even in the
long-term to sell.
Mr Zwahlen also ruled out more active management of the holdings, describing
the return on loans, swaps and options as 'low and volatile'.
The fear of large-scale net sales by central banks, which together with
international institutions have 35,000 tonnes in their vaults, had receded,
Mr Zwahlen said.
The conference is being held in London to coincide with the tercentenary of
the Bank of England. Mr Rupert Pennant-Rea, deputy governor, suggested that
the time was ripe for an annual survey of physical gold trading to provide a
figure for the aggregate market turnover. 'It is a pity that no data are
available for turnover, not just here in London but in all the various
physical centres,' he said.

FT  07 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: PNG policy confusion sends
mining shares tumbling

Shares in mining companies with interests in Papua New Guinea fell on the
Australian stockmarket yesterday as confusion reigned over whether there
could be a six to 12 month moratorium on new mining projects there.
At the weekend, Mr John Kaputin, PNG's mining and petroleum minister, said
that a moratorium would be imposed after a decision on the ADollars 1.2bn
(Pounds 590m) Lihir gold-mine project was taken, and that this would allow
him to rethink the country's mining policies. Mr Kaputin gave no hint of the
implications of such a 'rethink' - but one mining company speculated that it
could result in changes to the tax regime.
However, late yesterday, Mr Masket Iangalio, the finance minister and former
mining minister, said it was unlikely that the government would endorse Mr
Kaputin's moratorium idea. 'I wish to state categorically that the
development of our resources. . . will continue in an orderly manner without
interruption,' he said.
Kaputin-Iangalio split brings into the open simmering differences between
the two men - which, in turn, have affected the Lihir project, a joint
venture involving Britain's RTZ group and Niugini Mining, controlled by
Canada's Battle Mountain. For months the necessary special mining lease for
Lihir has not been forthcoming, while the PNG cabinet is understood to be
divided over how to structure the mine's development and what stakes to give
at the outset to the state-owned Malaysian Mining Corporation and to local
landowners.
Among the companies affected by yesterday's stockmarket sell-off were Dome
Resources, which lost seven cents at 45 cents, Highlands Gold, which shed
four cents to ADollars 1.40, and Niugini Mining, down 20 cents to ADollars
5.10.
Few mining companies or analysts wanted to talk publicly about the latest
turn of events in this resource-rich but notoriously unpredictable country.
Privately, however, they noted that Mr Kaputin made his remarks at an
extremely sensitive time in terms of PNG's domestic politics. A 'no
confidence' motion was tabled at the end of last week against Mr Paias
Wingti, the prime minister, based on allegations of bribery, corruption and
wife-beating.
The uncertainty over the moratorium is the latest in a series of blows to
international confidence in PNG. Other upheavals have included the guerrilla
war on Bougainville island; restructuring of interests in the Porgera gold
mine; and a ADollars 4bn environmental law suit filed against BHP, operator
of the Ok Tedi mine.

FT  07 JUN 94 / Government Bonds: Treasuries extend gains as policy worries
subside

US Treasury bonds yesterday extended gains struck in Friday's surprising
rally, with the market growing more confident in the conviction that
monetary policy was on hold for the summer.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  15/32 higher
at 88 3/16 , with the yield dropping to 7.22 per cent. On the short end, the
two-year note was  5/32 better at 100 3/16 , to yield 5.756 per cent.
The continued improvement gave rise to speculation that the bond market's
long slide, triggered by the Federal Reserve's policy shift four months ago,
was finally drawing to an end. Traders were encouraged by an article in The
New York Times which reinforced the view that the series of four interest
rate increases this year had succeeded in slowing the economy.
The story quoted three of the Fed's five governors as saying that inflation
was in check. The officials also said they did not consider the big drop in
the unemployment rate announced on Friday as alarming in the context of
other statistics pointing to slower growth.
The market was given additional support by declining commodity prices and a
stable dollar.
Traders linked further progress by bonds to the ability of the market to
push the yield on the 30-year issue below 7.20 per cent, a critical level of
resistance. It was hovering just above that point late in the day.
A nervous tone returned to the European government bond market yesterday, as
prices fell back after an early rally.
German bunds ended half a point lower after a strong start, when hopes of
returning investor interest faded. Dealers reported a spate of buying on
Friday and early yesterday, but buyers disappeared when 10-year bund yields
were pushed significantly below 7 per cent once again.
Mr John Hall, an international economist at Swiss Bank Corporation said that
'below 7 per cent (for 10-year bonds), the attraction for end-investors
isn't there'.
The bund market had been encouraged by a recovery in the US market on
Friday, and by comments by Bundesbank president Mr Hans Tietmeyer, reported
in a German financial newspaper, on Monday. Mr Tietmeyer said he hoped to
see west German inflation fall below 2 per cent during the course of 1995.
However, further buying failed to materialise, and German bond prices fell
back again. The pattern of 'poking a head above the parapet in the morning,
only to find that the momentum wasn't there' is typical of European bond
markets currently, said Mr George Magnus, an international economist at SG
Warburg.
The German market continues to under-perform the US market, with German
bonds now yielding just three basis points below 10-year US Treasuries.
'Germany has decoupled from the US market, but in the wrong direction,' said
Mr Hall.
Gilts opened strongly on the back of the recovery at the end of last week
but were dragged down in later trading by lack of demand.
'There is no conviction in the market,' said Mr Simon Briscoe, UK economist
at SG Warburg. 'There was some buying in the morning but then no follow
through.'
The fall in German government bonds and data showing a stronger than
expected rise in net lending to UK consumers added to the nervousness.
'The lack of confidence is so widespread that it is unlikely that events
this week will provide any support for gilts,' said Mr Briscoe.
'The political situation is a cloud on the horizon, the trade figures are a
concern and there will have to be a marked slowdown in industrial production
for those figures to help gilts,' he said. The long gilt future was down
9/16 point at 101 7/16 in late trading.
French government bonds ended slightly lower yesterday, dragged lower by
profit-taking and the decline in Germany.
They marginally outperformed German bunds with a slight narrowing of the
spread between the two in favour of French bonds.
Analysts said events in Germany were likely to continue to dominate for the
remainder of the week, although French industrial production and inflation
figures due later this week could provide support.

FT  07 JUN 94 / International Bonds: Sweden kicks off string of Canadian
dollar issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A strong Canadian government bond market and continued demand from
continental retail investors for short-dated Canadian dollar paper prompted
a rush of Canadian dollar issues in the eurobond market yesterday.
The Kingdom of Sweden kicked off with a CDollars 200m offering of 2 1/2
 year eurobonds which were priced to yield 20 basis points over the 7 3/4
per cent Canadian treasury due September 1996.
Lead manager Scotia McLeod said the December maturity on the eurobonds
increased the efficiency of the currency swap which was linked to the deal.
Sweden is believed to have swapped the proceeds of the offering into
floating-rate dollars. When the bonds were freed to trade, the spread was
largely unchanged which confounded some criticism in the market that they
were aggressively priced.
Societe Generale is also believed to have swapped the proceeds of its
CDollars 100m issue of 3 1/2 -year eurobonds into floating-rate dollars.
Joint lead manager BZW said the bonds, which were priced to yield 22 basis
points over the interpolated yield curve, were selling well which reflected
the issuer's strong following among retail investors.
BZW said although there had been quite a supply of Canadian dollar issues
recently, retail investors were still attracted by the yield pick-up of 200
basis points which Canadian treasuries offer over US Treasuries.
This could prompt more issuers to tap this sector. There were rumours
yesterday afternoon that Daimler-Benz was looking to raise Canadian dollars.
The Province of Ontario disappointed syndicate managers by opting to raise
CDollars 600m through an issue of 10-year bonds in the domestic market where
demand for long-dated maturities is said to be stronger than in the eurobond
market.
The issue was priced to yield 58 basis points above 10-year Canadian
treasuries which syndicate managers said was in line with the pricing which
Ontario would have achieved in the eurobond market.
Mr John Madden, Ontario's assistant deputy minister of treasury, said he was
pleased with yesterday's issue but he added that he was continuing to
monitor other currencies on a daily basis with a view to launching a
eurobond or global issue. Last week, the province was rumoured to be looking
at a euro-yen deal.
Moody's, the international credit rating agency, has downgraded to Ba3 from
Ba1 the long-term foreign-currency debt rating of Turkey. The downgrading
affects about Dollars 8.5bn of debt securities.
The downgrade reflects Moody's view that the Turkish economy will have to go
through a significant adjustment in order to correct the country's fiscal
and financial crises.

European Union finance ministers, meeting as the board of governors of the
European Investment Bank, yesterday formally established the Ecu2bn European
Investment Fund, AP-DJ reports from Brussels.
EIB said: 'Following the preparatory work by the bank, the governors have
now formally established the European Investment Fund, clearing the way for
the fund to hold its constitutive general meeting next week.'
The fund, originally agreed at the EU's summit in Edinburgh in December
1992, is designed to provide long-term loan guarantees to infrastructure
projects.
It will also put money into small- and medium-sized companies - marking a
first for the EIB which has a 40 per cent stake in the fund. The remaining
60 per cent shareholding is split equally between the EU via the European
Commission, and a total of 50 banks and financial institutions.
'It will fill a gap in the guarantee arrangements currently available and
will help lower the cost of finance,' the EIB said. 'Such guarantees are
increasingly in demand because of the declining availability of public
guarantees.'

FT  07 JUN 94 / International Capital Markets: Cofide seeks Dollars 100m
from sale of shares in fund manager
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cofide, the holding company of Mr Carlo de Benedetti, the Italian
industrialist, is seeking to raise Dollars 100m through the sale of around
24m shares in Finanza &amp; Futuro, one of the leading mutual fund management
groups in Italy.
The offering, via Lehman Brothers, is equivalent to around 39 per cent of
the company, which is 96.93 per cent owned by Cofide.
The sale will be made up of an international and domestic institutional
offering of 17m shares and an Italian public offering of 7m shares. An
over-allotment option of around 3.6m shares could also be made available in
the event of strong demand. A further 1m shares will be offered to employees
but this tranche will not be underwritten.
Finanza &amp; Futuro's mutual funds under management increased by 14 per cent
from the end of 1993 to L9,485bn at the end of April, making the group the
fourth-largest mutual fund group in Italy with a market share of 7 per cent.
The institutional offering will close on June 17 and the shares will be
priced the day after. The retail offering will open on June 20 and is
expected to close within one day. The shares will be allocated on June 27
and Consob, Italy's stock market regulator, is keen for the shares to start
trading on Milan's Telematico screen-based system on the same day.
In past offerings, there was usually a grey market in the new shares for
several days before they started trading officially on the Milan bourse.
Lehman Brothers expects the offer to appeal to investors keen to have an
exposure to Italy's fast-growing mutual fund industry.

FT  07 JUN 94 / International Company News: Thailand's Imperial Hotels sold
for Dollars 132m

<TEXT>
Thailand's Imperial Hotels Group has been sold to Mr Charoen
Siriwattanapakdi, one of the country's richest men, in a deal which values
the company at Dollars 132m.
The transaction is thought to rank among the largest in Thailand.
Imperial Hotels ran into financial difficulties after it opened the
1,400-room Imperial Queen's Park Hotel - Bangkok's biggest - two years ago
at a time when the number of foreign tourists arriving was in decline
following the military's suppression of pro-democracy demonstrations.
Mr Akorn Hoontrakul sold his family's 70 per cent stake in eight hotels for
Bt33 a share. This shows a premium of some 10 per cent to 12 per cent over
its net asset value, which includes debts of at least Bt3.5bn (Dollars 138m)
but also a land bank and lucrative smaller city hotels.
Mr Charoen controls the privately-owned Thai whisky maker Sura Thip, which
last year opened a joint beer-making venture with Carlsberg, the Danish
brewer.
He also has banking and insurance interests.
International Broadcasting Corp, the Thai cable television operator,
confirmed that it is in talks with Mr Rupert Murdoch's Star TV, AP-DJ
reports from Bangkok.
An IBC spokeswoman said that the operator was planning to double its number
of channels to 10, and that it was talking with Star TV about obtaining news
and entertainment to fill its programming needs.

FT  07 JUN 94 / International Company News: Swire chief gives pledge on
ownership of Cathay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
John Swire &amp; Sons, the owners of Cathay Pacific, the Hong Kong-based
airline, have reassured senior airline management and staff that they have
no intention of relinquishing control of the company.
In an unusual move Mr Peter Sutch, chairman of Cathay, has circulated a
letter from Swire's chairman, Sir Adrian Swire, instructing him to 'kill
this fantasy'. Mr Sutch said he hoped the letter would put this 'dangerous
notion to rest'.
There have been persistent doubts among some aviation analysts about the
willingness of China to abide by agreements and allow Cathay to remain
controlled by non-Chinese interests.
Cathay believes the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration and China's 1991
Basic Law for Hong Kong provide a secure future for the airline and its
owners after China resumes sovereignty in 1997.
But the future ownership of Cathay has resurfaced recently as a concern of
airline's pilots, currently engaged in pay negotiations. The pilots have
alleged that Cathay management's pressure on airline costs is a prelude to a
sell-off.
'(This) is something entirely without foundation,' Sir Adrian wrote in his
letter to Mr Sutch on May 26. 'It has never been considered by Swires and it
is an allegation which if it ever became accepted wisdom could do immense
harm to the credibility of Cathay Pacific and to the future of all those
associated with the airline, both employees and shareholders.
'It would be a tragedy if all the hard work that has been put in over the
past 10 years to secure the post-1997 future of Cathay were undermined by
irresponsible comment of this kind being reported in the press.'
Sir Adrian said that Swire had given assurances to the authorities in
Beijing that 'we were long-termers in China and Hong Kong'. Swire could not
possibly be so unwise as to do that if its intentions were the opposite, he
said.
After the 1984 Sino-British agreement Swire realised it had to give up some
control over Cathay.
The first move was the listing of the airline on the Hong Kong stock
exchange in 1986. It then encouraged mainland Chinese ownership of the
airline - mainland interests now control 22.5 per cent of the company, with
Swire Pacific owning 51.8 per cent.
Swire said yesterday that 'everyone is very comfortable' with the current
shareholding structure.
